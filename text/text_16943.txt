BACKGROUND
anthocyanins, a subclass of water-soluble colored flavonoids, provide red, blue and purple pigmentation to different organs of a wide range of higher plants  <cit> . these plant pigments play important roles, such as attraction of pollinators and seed dispersers and, given their antioxidant properties, protection against ultraviolet  and high intensity light, drought, wounding, cold temperatures and phytopathogen attack . in addition, the consumption of anthocyanin-rich fruits and vegetables is implicated to confer a number of health-related benefits, including protection against oxidative stress, coronary heart disease, inflammation, some types of cancer and other age-related diseases  <cit> . however, the health effects of dietary anthocyanins depend on amounts consumed and on their bioavailability. previous studies suggest that the bioavailability and excretion of anthocyanins and other polyphenols is highly influenced by their chemical structure  <cit> , including the nature of the sugar conjugate, the phenolic aglycone and acylation.

anthocyanins are synthesized via the flavonoid pathway, a late branch of the shikimic acid pathway  <cit> . although the biosynthetic pathways in different anthocyanin-containing species share a majority of common reactions, there are important differences between the types of anthocyanins produced and accumulated by each species. for example, bilberry  fruits accumulate a balanced mixture of five major anthocyanin aglycones  and lack pelargonidin  <cit> , whereas snapdragon and maize are incapable of producing delphinidin  <cit>  and carrot  almost exclusively accumulates cyanidin derivatives  <cit>  . regardless of the species, two classes of genes are involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis: structural genes encoding the enzymes that directly participate in the formation of anthocyanin pigments, and regulatory genes that control the transcription of structural genes. many of the genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, both structural and regulatory, have been identified and characterized for several model species, such as petunia , snapdragon  and maize , and both regulatory and structural genes vary widely across species  <cit> . consequently, information regarding the genetic control of anthocyanin biosynthesis may not be reliably extrapolated across species.

the genetics underlying anthocyanin pigmentation has been most extensively studied in flowers, fruit and leaves. only a few reports of genetic control of anthocyanin biosynthesis are published for underground organs –tubers, bulbs and storage roots .

anthocyanins may undergo a series of chemical modifications including glycosylation, acylation and methylation. these changes are usually performed by glycosyl-, acyl- and methyl-transferase enzymes, respectively. several studies have indicated that these modifications produce enormous chemical diversity  which influence anthocyanin stability and bioavailability. for example, clinical human feeding studies using raw and cooked purple carrots revealed that, compared to the anthocyanins in carrots consumed, the percentage recovery of non-acylated anthocyanins in serum was significantly greater than acylated anthocyanins, suggesting that acylation reduces anthocyanin bioavailability . conversely, acylated anthocyanins are more stable than non-acylated anthocyanins, providing the former with an advantage for their use as colorants in the food industry  <cit> . despite their importance, the genetic factors controlling these chemical modifications are still relatively unexplored.

carrot is a species that can accumulate large quantities of anthocyanins in its storage roots   <cit> . purple or “black” carrots accumulate almost exclusively cyanidin glycosides, both acylated and non-acylated, with five cyanidin pigments reported in most studies  <cit>  . substantial variation in anthocyanin profiles and in total anthocyanin concentration, and low amounts of derivatives of anthocyanidins other than cyanidin, have been reported among carrot cultivars  <cit> . in addition, tissue distribution of root purple pigmentation varies greatly across carrot genotypes, ranging from a few pigmented cell layers in the periderm to a completely- and intensively-colored root . the significance of dietary anthocyanins in human health and the extensive natural variation for the above traits has attracted the attention of carrot breeders. current breeding programs in purple carrot aim at increasing total anthocyanin content as well as achieving favorable ratios of acylated versus non-acylated anthocyanins depending on the end-market purpose, with a preference for high content of acylated anthocyanins for their use as food colorants, but conversely, high level of non-acylated forms for increasing bioavailability and nutraceutical value.table  <dig>

to date, a single dominant gene controlling anthocyanin accumulation in carrot roots, p <dig>  has been described  <cit> . recently, p <dig> was genetically mapped, as were several anthocyanin biosynthetic genes , but no tight linkage was found between p <dig> and any of the candidate structural genes evaluated  <cit> . however, the five structural genes  were expressed differentially and in decreasing order among those listed when comparing solid-purple , purple orange  and orange carrots, with transcript accumulation coinciding with anthocyanin accumulation. these studies suggested a coordinated regulatory control of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the carrot root, but the molecular and biochemical basis of genetic factors controlling the presence vs. absence of carrot root anthocyanin pigmentation remain unknown. furthermore, very little is known about the genetics of anthocyanin accumulation in carrot organs and tissues other than the tap root. variable expression of purple pigmentation in leaves, nodes and flowers was reported but not genetically characterized, and a simply inherited dominant locus controlling purple versus green pigmentation in petioles, p <dig>  was also described  <cit>  and linkage between p <dig> and p <dig> was suggested but not mapped.

phenotypic evaluations of p <dig> and p <dig> in previous studies of carrot were performed on the basis of visually scoring for presence or absence of purple color in the root and petiole, without providing a quantitative measurement on the extent of purple pigmentation in these organs. in addition to presence or absence of pigmentation, anthocyanin biosynthetic genes can also modify the profile of pigments and tissue-specific accumulation  <cit>  and to date, few studies in carrot have explored these factors affecting the relative accumulation of different anthocyanin pigments in purple-colored tissues. one exception is a study of variation in pigment profiles of four commercial carrot cultivars which found more than 10-fold variation in total anthocyanin content and significant variation in percentage cyanidin-3- and cyanidin-3- relative to the most abundant compound they found, cyanidin-3- achieved to date in carrot was recently reported by grzebelus et al.  <cit> . however, the anonymous and dominant nature of dart markers do not allow straight forward comparative map analysis or identification of candidate genes associated with qtl.

in the current study, we developed a snp-based linkage map with an unprecedented high map resolution in entire apiaceae family, using a carrot population segregating for anthocyanin pigmentation in root and leaves. through detailed phenotyping including hplc analysis we detected and mapped significant qtl for the different root anthocyanin glycosides. their map position relative to the position of a large-effect qtl for root pigment content revealed two regions on chromosome  <dig> largely conditioning purple root pigmentation and anthocyanin acylation, respectively. in addition, linkage mapping of the locus controlling purple pigmentation in leaves was performed, with its position being tightly linked to one of the qtl for root anthocyanins. a similar genetic control for purple pigmentation was found in an unrelated  genetic background. finally, we mapped the genetic loci controlling both root and petiole purple pigmentation in three unrelated carrot backgrounds and discovered that root and petiole anthocyanin pigmentation in diverse genetic backgrounds mapped to not only p <dig> but also other loci.

RESULTS
inheritance of purple root and petiole color
in population  <dig>  a total of 519 f <dig> plants were grown in two contrasting environments and phenotyped for presence/absence of purple pigmentation in carrot roots. in the largest  <dig> subset , evaluated under greenhouse conditions, purple pigmentation deviated significantly  from the 3: <dig> ratio expected for a single dominant gene in an f <dig>  that was reported previously for p <dig> in other carrot backgrounds  <cit>  . a smaller subset  of field-grown  <dig> plants also deviated from the expected 3: <dig> ratio . additional analyses of the data considering other genetic models revealed a good fit for a 9: <dig> segregation ratio in both greenhouse  and field-grown  plants of  <dig>  these data suggest that two dominant loci interact epistatically in the genetic control of root purple pigmentation in the  <dig> background.table  <dig>

further segregation analysis of purple root color in f <dig> and f <dig> derivatives of  <dig> revealed a general agreement with the genetic model proposed based upon segregation ratios observed in the f <dig>  under the proposed model, derivative families of purple rooted carrots are expected to segregate in purple: non-purple ratios of 1: <dig> , 9: <dig>  or 3: <dig> , whereas all derivatives from non-purple rooted carrots  are expected to be 100% non-purple, since both loci at a dominant state are required for pigment accumulation. of the  <dig> 70349-derived populations analyzed,  <dig> were developed from self-pollinating single purple-rooted plants and  <dig> populations derived from non-purple rooted progenitors .

all population  <dig> derived f3s and f4s fit expected ratios for the two-gene model proposed for the genetic control of root purple pigmentation . among the  <dig> populations derived from purple carrots,  <dig> f3s segregated for ‘purple: non-purple’ in a 9: <dig> ratio,  <dig> populations  showed a 3: <dig> ratio, and one f <dig> was fixed for purple . a good fit was observed among f <dig> families for the various expected ratios  . as expected, all the progenies derived from non-purple carrots  were 100% non-purple rooted .

in population  <dig>  anthocyanin pigmentation in petioles segregated as a simply inherited trait, with purple being dominant over green . among the  <dig> plants with non-purple petioles, all but two had non-purple roots. were it not for those two exceptions, these data would indicate that one of the two genes responsible for purple root pigmentation also conditioned purple petioles. if those two exceptions are due to variable penetrance, that model would be valid, but the two exceptions could also indicate that the gene conditioning petiole pigmentation is very closely linked to one of the genes for root pigmentation.

anthocyanin pigmentation was also evaluated in f <dig> population  <dig>  genetically unrelated to population  <dig> . in this population, purple pigmentation was dominant over non-purple and segregated as a single gene in both roots  and petioles . a previous study by yildiz et al.  <cit>  also found simple inheritance for root purple color in population  <dig>  an f <dig> with no petiole pigmentation that is unrelated to both the  <dig> and  <dig> populations. figure  <dig> presents root characteristics of the purple source progenitor in these three populations.

root pigment analysis
in contrast to the deep pigmentation of p <dig> , the purple pigmentation in the 70349 f <dig> and f <dig> populations, derived from p <dig>  was not as intense and primarily on the root exterior. root total pigment estimate  varied quantitatively in the f <dig> and ranged from 0%  to 100%   with most purple roots having rtpe values between 10% and 89% . all plants with dark purple petioles had purple roots while  <dig> % of the plants with purple petioles had non-purple roots, and  <dig> % of the plants with pale purple petioles had non-purple roots. rtpe values were relatively evenly distributed from 5% to 100% regardless of petiole color intensity .table  <dig>

*ratios reflect number of plants with high % acylated anthocyanins /total number of plants evaluated by hplc for a given rtpe category.



hplc data for root anthocyanins were obtained from  <dig> plants of population  <dig> with >5% rtpe purple pigmentation. pigment analyses in f <dig> individuals with 5% or less of their tap root surface colored with purple was not performed due to an insufficient amount of pigmented tissue available for hplc analysis.

hplc data demonstrated the accumulation of five cyanidin derivatives in roots of population 70349; two non-acylated  and three acylated pigments  . analysis of frequency distributions for the quantitative data revealed clear bimodal distributions for percentage cy3xgg and percentage cy3xfgg, with purple-rooted individuals having either less than 22%, or higher than 60% of cy3xgg, while rtpe and the other cyanidin derivatives more closely approximated normal distributions . all individuals with low % cy3xgg had high % acylated  anthocyanins  while all high % cy3xgg individuals had low % acylated anthocyanins . in fact, the relative content of the non-acylated cy3xgg was strongly and inversely correlated with the total relative content of acylated anthocyanins , as is evident in the clustering of the relative distributions of these compounds among f <dig> individuals. the bimodal distribution of % cy3xgg/% acylated was further investigated. two clear groups of  <dig> individuals with ‘high cy3xgg/low acylated’ and  <dig> individuals with ‘low cy3xgg/high acylated’ were identified . these results suggest that acylation of cy3xgg to produce cy3xsgg and cy3xfgg results in the shift from ‘low’ to ‘high’ content of acylated anthocyanins and a relatively simple genetic basis underlies this acylation. total acylated anthocyanin content was not associated with rtpe values , but plants with dark purple petioles tended to be in the high acylated category .

among carrots included in hplc analysis, the 38: <dig> segregation ratio did not fit a single gene model for an f <dig> , with ‘low cy3xgg/high acylated’ being dominant over ‘high cy3xgg/low acylated’. this distorted segregation ratio may suggest a more complex genetic basis underlying this trait, or may reflect the fact that hplc analysis was only performed on a subset of purple roots in the population.

among individuals with high content of acylated anthocyanins  the feruloyl-containing pigment  was the most abundant anthocyanin in most plants, with a concentration range of 25-85%, followed by cy3xsgg  and cy3xcgg . since in most plants, cy3xcgg was detected in trace amounts and therefore its genetic analysis may not be accurate, this pigment was excluded from qtl analysis. more detailed analyses of relationships among the individual anthocyanin pigments and rtpe are in additional file 4: figure s <dig> b and table s <dig> 

construction of the framework linkage map in population 70349
out of the  <dig> snps evaluated,  <dig>  produced distinct genotypic clusters using the kbioscience  platform that functions with the kaspar assay. of these,  <dig> were polymorphic and were used for linkage mapping analysis. screening of  <dig> ssr markers with known chromosome location in a subset of the  <dig> population allowed the identification of  <dig> polymorphic ssrs.

at lod >  <dig>  of the  <dig> polymorphic loci,  <dig> markers were grouped in nine linkage groups , consistent with the carrot haploid chromosome number . all markers with known chromosome location grouped as expected and all groups were unambiguously anchored to the nine carrot chromosomes .figure  <dig>

evaluation of marker order in each linkage group by checkmatrix revealed minimal or no error in scores, therefore indicating a high quality linkage map . in order to reduce the complexity of the linkage map figure, redundant markers  were removed from the image, leaving a single marker per locus or bin. the resulting carrot genetic map includes  <dig> non-redundant data points . a complete list of all the mapped markers, including redundant markers, is provided in additional file  <dig>

three clusters of distorted markers were identified on ch <dig>  ch <dig> and ch <dig>  a major portion of ch <dig> had high segregation distortion . these results are consistent with recent mapping of dart markers in this same f <dig> population where high segregation distortion of markers in chromosome  <dig> was found, resulting in the mapping of a very low number of non-distorted markers  <cit> .

the relative content of the predominant non-acylated anthocyanin pigment cy3xgg, had a clear bimodal distribution in the f <dig> compatible with a simply-inherited dominant trait, and for mapping purposes was scored as a dominant phenotypic marker. as such, for purposes of map construction, individuals with ≥ 60% cy3xgg  were considered as the recessive status , and those with ≤ 22%  as dominant , based on their relative frequency distribution which nearly fit a 3: <dig> ratio  for individuals with ‘≤22% cy3xgg’: ‘≥60% cy3xgg’ or ‘low cy3xgg/high acylated’: ‘high cy3xgg/low acylated’. mapping only included  <dig> individuals with >5% pigmented roots . with this approach, the genetic factor conditioning accumulation of cy3xgg was mapped to ch <dig> and co-localized with marker k <dig> . cy3xgg, mapped as a single dominant gene controlling high versus low content of acylated anthocyanins, was denoted raa <dig>  to distinguish it from cy3xgg content evaluated as a quantitative trait.

qtl analysis and mapping in population 70349
qtl analysis was carried out for four anthocyanin glycosides  and for total pigment content  in roots of  <dig>  significant qtl  were detected for all traits . in total,  <dig> qtl were mapped onto the carrot linkage map . consistent with the two-gene model observed for root purple color segregation in f2-f <dig> families, two qtl were detected for rtpe on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the qtl in chromosome  <dig> had a strong statistical support  and the largest effect on phenotype, explaining  <dig> % of the observed variation. the support interval for this large-effect qtl was delimited within a  <dig>  cm map region. the other rtpe qtl, located in chromosome  <dig>  had less statistical support  and only accounted for  <dig> % of the variation, and its support interval covered a large region  of chromosome  <dig> table  <dig>

the locus controlling anthocyanin pigmentation in leaves mapped to ch <dig> and was tightly linked  to marker k <dig> this trait was earlier noted to be either tightly linked  to one of the genes for rtpe, or it may correspond to the same gene, with the exceptional plants with purple roots and non-purple petioles due to reduced penetrance of petiole pigmentation. an examination of the markers flanking the purple petiole locus for these two exceptional plants indicated alleles for only the purple-rooted parent. this suggests reduced penetrance of petiole pigmentation rather than recombination of a second gene within this region accounting for these exceptions. based upon this evidence, we surmise that the same gene controls both petiole and root pigmentation, and we name that gene p <dig>  p <dig> mapped within the  <dig> - <dig>  cm region harboring four qtl for root anthocyanins, suggesting that this 12 cm region harbors the genetic determinants conditioning both root and petiole pigmentation.

qtl for individual anthocyanin pigments were distributed across six chromosomes  . the number of qtl detected for each pigment ranged from three to four. the phenotypic variation explained by qtl with the largest effect for each trait was –from smallest to largest-  <dig> % for cy3xg,  <dig> % for cy3xsgg,  <dig> % for cy3xfgg and  <dig> % for cy3xgg.

eight qtl with the highest lod values  and the largest phenotypic effects were mapped in two regions of chromosome  <dig>  these two regions covered by the qtl support intervals are  <dig> - <dig>  cm and  <dig> - <dig>  cm, respectively. the  <dig> - <dig>  cm region harbors co-localized qtl for all five traits . allelic interactions for markers in this region of chromosome  <dig> were examined . for all the qtl in this region, the ‘a’ allele at the nearest qtl marker had a recessive effect on phenotype. root total pigment content estimate was highest in heterozygote  individuals for marker k <dig>  the closest marker linked to the rtpe-qtl. root pigmentation in these heterozygous individuals was on average nearly ten-fold higher  than in individuals homozygous for the ‘b’ allele . these results suggest an over-dominant effect in individuals heterozygous  for the “rtpe qtl”.

the  <dig> - <dig>  cm region of chromosome  <dig> harbors overlapping qtl for cy3xsgg, cy3xfgg and cy3xgg . the cy3xgg qtl had the highest statistical support  and the largest phenotypic effect  of all  <dig> mapped qtl. in addition, the support interval of cy3xgg overlapped the shortest map distance  of all qtl. interestingly, the narrow qtl region that influenced cy3xgg content co-localized with raa <dig> in the linkage map, supporting the idea that a single chromosomal region may control anthocyanin acylation in carrot roots. for this gene, the dominant allele  conditions acylation of anthocyanins  while the recessive  genotype conditions low acylation  .

while it was noted that the raa <dig> gene, with a segregation ratio of 38: <dig>  did not fit a single gene model above, an examination of the allelic status of those plants with purple roots that were not included in hplc analysis  observed that  <dig> of these individuals had homozygous markers for the recessive allele, and  <dig> had at least one dominant allele. the inclusion of these data in our earlier segregation analysis for raa <dig> did fit a single gene model for an f <dig> , suggesting that anthocyanin acylation is, in fact, a single gene conditioned by raa <dig> 

as expected based upon their co-localization in the linkage map, analysis of allele interactions for cy3xsgg and cy3xfgg qtl that mapped in the  <dig> - <dig>  cm region  coincided with the observed allelic interactions for cy3xgg. the ‘a’ allele at the nearest marker for cy3xsgg and cy3xfgg qtl was dominant over the ‘b’ allele, where the dominant genotypes  had high content of acylated anthocyanins  and the recessive genotypes  had low content of acylated pigments . to account for quantitative variation in these two pigments, the phenotypic cutoff for the dominant  and recessive  genotypic classes was ~10% for cy3xsgg , and ~26% for cy3xfgg  .

comparative mapping of anthocyanin traits
in addition to the  <dig> mapping population, the phenotypic traits controlling purple root and petiole pigmentation, and several common markers  and genes  were mapped in two other populations,  <dig> and  <dig>  both developed from crosses between purple- and orange-rooted carrots, where the purple progenitor was genetically and phenotypically different from the genetic source of purple pigmentation in population  <dig> and from each other .

comparative map analysis of ch <dig> from  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was performed . the use of six data-points in common across the three maps, including markers tightly linked  to all the anthocyanin traits mapped in each chromosome allowed accurate map comparisons and revealed high marker collinearity across the three maps.figure  <dig> 
comparative mapping of loci on chromosome  <dig> controlling anthocyanin pigmentation in three carrot genetic backgrounds. the f <dig> mapping populations  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were developed using different purple-rooted genotypes as progenitors. all linkage groups correspond to ch <dig> of the respective maps. anthocyanin traits, indicated in red and italic font, include the loci controlling purple root and petiole pigmentation in populations  <dig> and  <dig> , root pigmentation in  <dig> , and raa <dig>  the locus conditioning root anthocyanin acylation in population  <dig>  the support interval for the qtl for root total pigment estimate  in population  <dig> is indicated in red. common markers across chs are denoted in bold and connected by horizontal dotted lines. the following genes are denoted in italics: f3h , fls , psy <dig> .



in population  <dig>  purple root pigmentation was previously found to be conditioned by a single dominant gene, p <dig>   <cit>  which mapped to ch <dig>  <cit> . the snp marker k <dig> tightly linked to p <dig> was included in the  <dig> - <dig>  cm region of chromosome  <dig> in population  <dig>  and was also tightly linked to four co-localized qtl for anthocyanin glycosides. this region  also mapped to ch <dig> of population  <dig> but was relatively distant  from p <dig> . in addition, two markers  in chromosome  <dig> of population  <dig> that were tightly linked to raa <dig>  the locus controlling anthocyanin acylation, and to three overlapping qtl for acylated and non-acylated anthocyanin pigments mapped to ch <dig> of population  <dig> at a distance of  <dig> - <dig>  cm away from p <dig>  these data clearly indicated that the loci controlling anthocyanin pigmentation in roots of diverse genetic backgrounds differ, and those in the  <dig> population are different from p <dig> 

in population  <dig> the f <dig> plants were all purple-rooted and had purple petioles, whereas in the f <dig>  purple pigmentation segregation was consistent with a single gene model  with dominance for purple over non-purple.. root and petiole pigmentation completely co-segregated in this population, indicating that the same gene controls pigmentation in both organs. this gene mapped with  <dig> molecular markers , conforming a linkage group of 49 cm, with an average distance between adjacent markers of  <dig>  cm . the use of chromosome-anchoring markers  <cit>  allowed the orientation and assignment of this lg to carrot chromosome  <dig> 

in ch <dig> of  <dig>  the locus controlling purple pigmentation in roots and petioles was tightly linked to k <dig>  the same marker that was tightly linked to p <dig>  rtpe and four other anthocyanin qtl in  <dig>  suggesting that the same chromosome region controls root and petiole anthocyanin pigmentation in  <dig> and  <dig>  and this region clearly differs from p <dig>  thus, we surmise that the locus controlling root purple and petiole pigmentation in  <dig> was p <dig> .

discussion
development of the first high resolution gene-derived snp-based linkage map in the apiaceae
the development of transcriptome-base snp markers from d. carota next-generation sequencing data  <cit>  has opened the possibility for performing cost-effective high-throughput genotyping of carrot mapping and breeding populations. from an initial screening of  <dig> snp markers developed from expressed sequence tag  data  <cit> , we constructed a carrot linkage map with map resolution for a sequence-based marker map unprecedented in the apiaceae. the resulting genetic map harbored  <dig> polymorphic molecular markers covering  <dig>  cm, with an average map resolution of  <dig>  cm. to date, only  <dig> markers with known sequence information have been mapped in carrot  <cit>  with the most dense map containing  <dig> sequence-based markers  and a resolution of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . other maps were mainly based on anonymous dominant aflp, rapd, rflp and dart markers  <cit> . the total length of the map  was similar to the map length found in other studies  but smaller than the linkage maps developed by cavagnaro et al.  <cit>  , just et al.  <cit>  , grzebelus et al.  <cit>  . the observed differences in total map length among these studies are most likely attributable to the different software and algorithms used for linkage analysis. while the present study, as well as those of vivek and simon  <cit>  and alessandro et al.  <cit>  used joinmap  <cit> , the maps of cavagnaro et al.  <cit> , just et al.  <cit>  and grzebelus et al.  <cit>  used mapmaker  <cit> . these two programs use very different mathematical and statistical procedures to construct the linkage groups  <cit>  and these can account for the observed variation among carrot map sizes. several linkage mapping studies have noted that marker distance and linkage group lengths were consistently larger with mapmaker than joinmap, regardless of the organism and the type of marker used . this difference was observed even when both programs used the same mapping function  <cit> . because the multilocus-likelihood method used by mapmaker assumes an absence of crossover interference while linkage maps constructed with joinmap are more accurate and shorter when such interference is present  <cit> .

another source of variation that may contribute to size differences observed among the carrot maps is the type of marker used. uncorrected genotyping errors often detected with dominant aflp markers, such as those predominantly used in earlier carrots maps with higher map size, can drastically increase the calculated map lengths  <cit> . such error is unlikely in our codominant snp-based map. marker scores across each linkage group were verified using checkmatrix to eliminate miss-scored markers that may generate false double cross-overs , therefore providing a solid support to the marker order.

the linkage map constructed in this study provides an unprecedented opportunity for integrating carrot genetic maps. most of the ssr and gene-specific markers included in our map represent common data points across several linkage maps constructed for various carrot traits  as well as chromosome anchoring markers  <cit> . in addition, over  <dig> snps mapped in this study are shared with a recently developed linkage map containing qtl for nematode resistance  <cit> . integration of carrot genetic maps, including our dense snp-based map, will rapidly increase marker density and include informative sequence-based markers relative to previously unsaturated map regions containing important traits. this will allow for straight forward identification of candidate genes to characterize traits with the upcoming carrot genome sequence  <cit> .

high resolution linkage maps constructed with sequence-based markers are crucial for aiding in the assembly of next-generation sequence data used in genome sequencing projects. the map developed in this study, with  <dig> sequence-based markers and a resolution of  <dig>  cm, is currently being used to facilitate the assembly of the carrot genome sequence.

genetics of anthocyanin pigmentation in carrot
based on examination of the structure of the five cyanidin glycosides present in carrot roots , together with available information on anthocyanin biochemistry in carrot  <cit>  and other species , a proposed scheme for cyanidin modification in carrot is presented in figure  <dig>  based on this scheme, an inverse balance between the content of nonacylated cy3xgg and acylated cy3xcgg, cy3xfgg, and cy3xsgg is expected, with the balance modulated by the activity of an acyltransferase.figure  <dig> 
proposed anthocyanin biochemical pathway noting pigments and genes  involved in anthocyanin formation and compound modification in carrot roots. in bold are anthocyanin pigments detected by hplc in this and previous studies. abbreviations correspond to the pigments full names, as in table  <dig> 



in the present study, the strong negative correlation found between the non acylated cy3xgg and the total content of acylated anthocyanin forms  strongly suggests that acylation of cy3xgg, presumably by an acyltransferase , causes this shift from non-acylated to acylated anthocyanin forms. in addition, the co-localization of a large-effect qtl for cy3xgg and two qtl for the major acylated anthocyanins  in a very narrow map region  of chromosome  <dig>  not only reinforces the notion that cy3xgg is the chemical substrate for acylation, giving rise to cy3xsgg and cy3xfgg, but also suggests that this region is largely responsible for the genetic control of root anthocyanin acylation. furthermore, our combined pigment and linkage analysis data for cy3xgg provide evidence that suggests a single dominant gene controlling this trait. the clear bimodal distribution of cy3xgg in the f <dig>  a segregation ratio compatible with a simply inherited dominant trait, and the co-localization of this trait mapped both as a qtl and as single gene, all suggest that indeed a single dominant gene controls ‘high’ versus ‘low’ content of acylated anthocyanins in roots of  <dig>  we name this gene raa <dig> 

in addition to raa <dig>  two qtl with relatively smaller phenotypic effects conditioning anthocyanin acylation were detected in ch <dig>  23 cm apart from raa <dig>  and ch <dig>  suggesting a complex regulation for modification of carrot pigments, with several genes probably influencing acylation.

because acylation of carrot anthocyanins influences bioavailability , an important property of dietary nutrients in human health, and it also influences pigment stability  <cit> , important for the use of pigments in foods and as dyes, further characterization of raa <dig> is of interest. with the carrot genome sequence nearing completion  <cit> , in combination with the sequence-based markers tightly linked to raa <dig> in the current  <dig> genetic map, searching for candidate genes will be straight forward. a detailed characterization of raa <dig> may have a positive impact in carrot breeding programs aiming at developing carrots with higher nutraceutical value  and also carrots with more stable pigments  for the food industry.

a previous study in carrot demonstrated that acylation of anthocyanins is important for transport into the vacuoles  <cit> , suggesting that acylation may play an important role for the accumulation of stable pigments in carrot roots. however, in the present study, only a weak significant correlation  was found between purple root pigmentation  and one of the acylated compounds . in addition, raa <dig>  which conditions high versus low content of acylated anthocyanins, did not co-localize with either of the two rtpe qtl in the linkage map, suggesting that acylation does not have a major effect on the accumulation of root anthocyanins in the  <dig> genetic background.

mapping of anthocyanin qtl
the study presented here represents the first comprehensive qtl analysis of anthocyanin pigmentation and pigment modification performed in carrot. using quantitative data we identified  <dig> qtl covering eight genomic regions associated with accumulation of four cyanidin derivatives and with the percentage of purple pigmentation  in carrot root. consistent with the two-gene model observed for root purple color segregation in f2-f <dig> families, two qtl on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were detected to account for variation in rtpe.

with the exception of the cy3xgg qtl in the  <dig> - <dig>  cm region of ch <dig>  the qtl with the largest phenotypic effect for all the anthocyanin glycosides and for root total pigment content, which explained  <dig>  -  <dig> % of the variation, were associated with the  <dig> - <dig>  cm region of ch <dig> and best associated with marker k <dig>  we propose that this qtl region includes a gene that controls the primary regulatory mechanism underlying anthocyanin accumulation. detection of ten additional qtl covering six genomic regions associated with the accumulation of individual anthocyanin compounds, located on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> indicates the complexity of the genetic control of anthocyanin accumulation in carrot. based on studies in other crops these qtl could be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, accumulation, and chemical modification  necessary for the stable storage of these pigments, as has been reported for anthocyanin accumulation and diversification in other species. for example, in raspberry, bushakra et al.  <cit>  detected  <dig> qtl associated with the accumulation and diversity of different cyanidin derivatives, while in grapes, fournier-level et al.  <cit>  detected multiple qtl associated with cyanidin methylation and accumulation.

synteny and putative orthologous anthocyanin loci among carrot maps
several carrot maps for various traits of interest, including anthocyanin and carotenoid pigmentation, have been developed  <cit>  but common markers across linkage maps carrying similar traits in different genetic backgrounds were usually lacking in these previous studies.

in the present study, the use of sequence-based markers for chromosome  <dig> in common across three linkage maps of carrot harboring root and petiole anthocyanin traits revealed high synteny among the maps . this, in combination with the use of markers tightly linked to the anthocyanin mapped traits, revealed that the genetic factors conditioning root pigmentation in populations  <dig>  and  <dig>  are different from p <dig>  previously reported in  <dig>  <cit> . the syntenic correspondence between rtpe  and p <dig>  and the tight linkage of both traits to marker k <dig> in both maps suggests that this region controls root anthocyanin accumulation in both genetic backgrounds.

purple carrots played an important role in the domestication of carrot as a tap root crop  <cit> . based upon historical documents, it is believed that the first domesticated carrot roots were purple and yellow and such domestication occurred in central asia, with orange carrots representing a secondary and european domestication event  <cit> . our comparative map analysis for anthocyanin accumulation in carrot represents not only a breeding tool but also provides further insight into carrot domestication. the fact that two different genes control anthocyanin root pigmentation in unrelated genetic backgrounds suggests that independent mutations and human selection events may have contributed to the domestication of purple carrots. petiole anthocyanin pigmentation segregated as a simply-inherited trait in populations  <dig> and  <dig>  and was mapped for the first time. furthermore, in this study, we present clear evidence for pleiotropy at a single gene controlling both petiole and root pigmentation in these two populations. this is in contrast to a previous study which found, in a population not included in this study, that root pigmentation and petiole pigmentation were controlled by different genes  <cit> . coincidently with our results in populations  <dig> and  <dig>  a single gene, an <dig>  has been found to condition anthocyanin pigmentation in different tissues  of potato . together, these findings emphasize the observation that anthocyanin biosynthesis, accumulation and structure is a complex trait in carrot, as has been observed in several other plant species. even beyond identifying candidate genes for qtl identified in this study, more genes conditioning this trait are likely to be discovered elsewhere in the carrot genome.

despite the high synteny observed among the three maps, their total length varied considerably. while the map lengths were comparable between population  <dig>  and population  <dig> , the former maps were shorter than the  <dig> map of ch <dig> . this is likely due to the fewer number of markers mapped in  <dig> and  <dig> compared to  <dig>  with the former maps lacking markers in one  or both  of the terminal chromosome ends, as is evident from map comparisons in figure  <dig>  the mapping of these eight sequence-based and common markers allowed for a close comparison of these  <dig> maps, and will contribute to map integration while increasing marker informativeness and marker saturation in the  <dig> and  <dig> backgrounds. more importantly, this will result in an immediate increase in marker saturation in nearby regions of p <dig>  p <dig> and raa <dig>  which will facilitate tracking these genes in breeding programs, and will further facilitate searching for candidate genes in the upcoming carrot genome sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
an informative high resolution snp-based genetic map of carrot was constructed and used for detection and mapping of root anthocyanin qtl. in population  <dig>  the mapping of  <dig> qtl across  <dig> carrot chromosomes suggests a more complex regulation for this trait than previously described in a previously unstudied genetic background, with many genes probably influencing pigment biosynthesis, compound modification and/or accumulation. of particular interest, a 12 cm region of chromosome  <dig> harboring co-localized qtl with largest phenotypic effect for root total pigment content  and four anthocyanin glycosides, as well as the simply-inherited gene p <dig>  which was largely responsible for the genetic control of anthocyanin pigmentation in both roots and petioles. in addition, quantitative data analysis for each anthocyanin compound provided the opportunity to identify a large effect qtl and a simply-inherited gene, raa <dig>  that was also on chromosome  <dig> and associated with anthocyanin acylation. comparative map analysis revealed that neither of these chromosome regions that were associated with anthocyanin pigmentation and acylation, respectively, corresponded to the p <dig> gene initially reported for root purple pigmentation.

the present study increases the current knowledge on the genetic control for this complex trait in carrot. these data, together with the molecular resources generated herein  and the upcoming carrot genome sequence will facilitate cloning of the genetic factors controlling both anthocyanin accumulation and acylation. characterization of such genes will have a positive impact on carrot breeding programs aiming at increasing pigment concentration and anthocyanin profiles, depending on the end-market use.
