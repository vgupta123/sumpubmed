BACKGROUND
genomic data is revolutionizing molecular parasitology and has been used to prioritize drug targets in parasites at a genomic level  <cit> . similarly, pan-phylum genomic studies in parasitic nematodes have identified both highly conserved nematode-specific proteins  <cit> , which are attractive as drug candidates as their targeting will not affect the host, and nematode-specific indels in essential proteins  <cit> , which could also be good candidates for "indel-based" drug design in nematodes. complementing the genomic data, expression data reflects the dynamics of genetic information. analysis of digital expression data, obtained by sequencing cdnas, is crucial for studying and understanding organism's development, physiology, and environmental adaptation. knowledge of these mechanisms in parasites is essential to substantially accelerate research toward the development of both new therapies to prevent parasite infections and vaccines  needed to control them.

infection of humans by parasitic nematodes results in substantial human mortality and morbidity, especially in tropical regions of africa, asia, and the americas. hookworms, probably the most significant public health threat of these nematodes, are the second largest contributor to the  <dig>  million annual dalys  from iron-deficiency anemia due to blood feeding by adult worms. chronic anemia from hookworm infection is particularly devastating to children, who suffer from stunted growth and impaired intellectual development, to mothers who are at increased risk for anemia during pregnancy and childbirth, and to the elderly  <cit> . current hookworm control strategies are limited to deworming of infected people using anthelmintic drugs. however, rapid re-infection in endemic areas and the lack of sterile immunity necessitates repeated treatments, which will in turn result in resistance. the high rates of re-infection after drug therapy mean that vaccines remain the best hope for worm control in humans in the future. no vaccine is yet available, despite substantial support from the bill and melinda gates foundation specifically for the development of a hookworm vaccine  <cit> . until safe and effective vaccines are developed, anthelmintics will continue to be used for treatment and control of nematode infections in humans. thus, there is a critical need for further research to identify new vaccine and drug targets which requires better understanding of the biology and parasitism of these devastating parasites.

ancylostoma caninum, a canine hookworm closely related to the human parasites ancylostoma duodenale and necator americanus  <cit> , is the most widely used model for human hookworm infections  <cit> . similar to other hookworms, adult a. caninum inhabit the small intestine and produce eggs that pass in the feces and hatch in the soil. the first stage larva feeds on bacteria and molts twice to form the non-feeding, infective third stage . il <dig> enters the host by penetrating the skin, molts twice, and matures in to the adult  stage in the small intestine. a. caninum il <dig> can also infect a host, temporarily abort maturation and enter an arrested state  within the host's somatic tissues  <cit> , reactivating in response to host physiological changes such as pregnancy  <cit> .

a. caninum is a clade v nematode  <cit>  that also includes the well-studied free-living model nematode caenorhabditis elegans. c. elegans was the first multicellular genome to be sequenced  <cit>  and it remains the only metazoan for which the sequence of every nucleotide is known to high confidence. recently, the genome of the human parasite brugia malayi, has been sequenced and analyzed  <cit> . brugia malayi is phylogenetically classified in clade iii  <cit> . the distant phylogenetic relationship between a. caninum and b. malayi  makes investigation of nematode adaptation to parasitism easier, as similarities shared by a. caninum and b. malayi  are likely to be associated with adaptation to parasitism. our previous studies based on limited coverage of a. caninum revealed the existence of genes unique to hookworm and the different selective pressures on these genes  <cit> . another study using microarray technology  <cit>  found several hundred genes in a. caninum changed their expression during the worm's transition from a free living to a parasitic larva. however, because of the limitation of the data and/or methods of these studies, many questions, especially those related to parasitism, remain to be fully explored.

to better understand the biology of parasitism and facilitate prioritization of potential vaccine and drug targets, the present study deeply sequenced the a. caninum transcriptome with a combination of two distinct sequencing technologies, abi sanger capillary and 454/roche massively parallel sequencing platforms. over  <dig>  million cdnas were generated from different cdna libraries constructed from pre-parasitic, parasitic larval and adult stages. these reads covered over 90% of the a. caninum transcriptome with an average depth of 10×. this dataset was also used to perform comprehensive comparative analysis among a. caninum, b.malayi and  c. elegans, and the unprecedented depth of coverage enabled comparison of digital expression profiles leading to reliable identification of differentially expressed genes during development. this study provides the first nearly complete transcriptome from a parasitic nematode and provides valuable information about nematode adaptations to parasitism, in addition to revealing several candidates for further study as drug target or vaccine components.

RESULTS
sequence acquisition, organization and transcriptome coverage
over  <dig>  million ests were generated from  <dig> stages, infective l <dig> larva , activated l <dig> larva , adult male , and female , of a. caninum . these  <dig> , <dig> reads include  <dig> , <dig> pyrosequencing reads  and  <dig>  sanger reads . the larval stages were represented by nearly half a million reads, and the adult stages with nearly  <dig>  reads .

assembly, which was performed to reduce data redundancy and improve sequence quality and length, grouped the sequences into  <dig>  transcripts longer than  <dig> bp, for a total of  <dig> mb. the transcript consensus sequences are available at http://nematode.net <cit> . the average transcript length was  <dig> bp and average coverage was 10×. using the core eukaryotic genes as a reference, we estimated that 93% of the a. caninum transcriptome is identified , making this the first parasitic nematode with a near complete sequenced transcriptome.

nematode transcriptome diversity and parasitism related genes
even though a. caninum and c. elegans fall in the same phylogenetic clade  <cit> , only about 20% of a. caninum transcripts are homologous to c. elegans coding genes, and even lower number  to b. malayi coding genes . however, when only considering the highly expressed transcripts  about 43% of a.caninum transcripts are homologous to c. elegans. when all the transcripts were considered, the vast majority  of the a. caninum transcripts were species-specific. this indicates high transcriptome diversity among nematodes. however, this diversity did not correspond to a drastic difference on functional level. the total unique number of kos associated to the a. caninum and c. elegans genes were very similar , with only one  out of the  <dig> identified pathways having a statistically significant increased number of unique kos  in a. caninum.

there were  <dig>  transcripts with b. malayi homologs  but no c. elegans homologs  despite a. caninum being more closely related phylogenetically to c. elegans. the majority of these transcripts  failed to find any go annotations. nevertheless, functions of the  <dig> transcripts having go annotation are enriched in  <dig> go terms, prolyl oligopeptidase activity , nucleic acid binding , and dna binding , with the most enriched category being prolyl oligopeptidase activity. in addition, malic enzyme activity was enriched  though it failed our fdr cutoff because of the small number of entries in this activity. as a comparison, no go term enrichment was detected when considering the b. malayi genes with homology to c. elegans but not a. caninum. meanwhile, homology comparison among the free-living c. elegans and the parasites a. caninum and b. malayi found that more b. malayi genes share homology with a. caninum  than with c. elegans  . the higher number of homologous genes among parasites was statistically significant . since b. malayi  is phylogentically more distant from a. caninum than c. elegans   <cit> , b. malayi would share a similar level of homology with both c. elegans and a. caninum if parasitism had no effect on gene evolution. therefore, we hypothesize that the  <dig>  transcripts represent putative parasitism related genes.

comparative genomics of gene expression during development of a. caninum
the deep sequencing of this study allowed us to examine differential expression of inferred transcripts and shed light on their functions due to the association of the gene expression with molecular function. figure  <dig> summarizes the expression selectivity of the  <dig>  transcripts that have sequencing depth for confident estimation of expression selectivity, and table  <dig> contains the ten most abundant transcripts selectively expressed in different stages . only half of the transcripts are expressed through all the stages. the most dramatic change observed between the developmental stages studied was the transition from larvae to adult: more than  <dig>  transcripts were turned off and nearly  <dig>  turned on. this is not unexpected, especially since the developing l <dig> stage was not examined. the serum stimulation turned off  <dig> transcripts, and turned on  <dig> transcripts. more than one third of the turned-on genes were turned off again in m, f, or m and f. consistent with these expression changes, comparison of the preparasitic to parasitic  and parasitic larval to adult stages  revealed that nearly twice the number of transcripts have significant expression changes in the latter transition than the former .

larval specific
a molecular function; b biological processes; c cellular component

among the  <dig> transcripts turned on by serum stimulation,  <dig> of them are parasitism related . given that there are a total of  <dig> parasitism related transcripts among all the  <dig>  transcripts , there is no evidence to support that serum stimulation triggers an extensive expression of parasitism related genes. however, parasitism related genes are more selective expressed in adults. nearly 18% of these genes  exhibit m, f, or m and f selectivity, which is significant  when compared to the overall of 9% . interesting, compared to the small fraction of male specific transcripts related to parasitism , a large fraction of female specific transcripts  are parasitism related.

the majority of nematode conserved transcripts  exhibited constant expression over all stages, while less than 40%  of the a. caninum specific transcripts exhibited the same expression pattern . this difference is highly significant statistically . more than 80% of il <dig> selective transcripts  are a. caninum specific. the different expression pattern of conserved transcripts and a. caninum specific transcripts suggests caution in using cdna data to estimate transcriptome diversity. using limited number of cdna reads can underestimate the diversity. for example, the homolog rate between a. caninum and c. elegans would be 54% /8074) if only the transcripts expressed constantly across the life cycle were considered while that is 20% when all transcripts are included.

the expression profiles defined by our sequencing were compared to the data published by datu et al.,  <cit> . datu et al. studied transcriptional changes in the hookworm, a. caninum, during the transition from a free-living to a parasitic larva using suppression subtractive hybridization  and custom oligonucleotide microarray printed with the ssh expressed sequence tags. comparison of the two expression profiles of the most highly up-regulated mrnas associated with serum stimulation obtained by different orthogonal approaches confirmed consistency in expression of  <dig> out of the  <dig> up-regulated mrna associated with serum stimulation. the only one not consistent is cdna that has been broken into several transcripts in our assembly, therefore giving rise to this discrepancy .

functional profile of transcripts with different expression selectivity
examining the function of transcripts with different expression patterns using go terms revealed that enriched and depleted go terms correlate to the biology of the corresponding stages. the heatmaps of molecular function go terms  shows that transcripts with different expression selectivity exhibit different functional profiles, although that of the transcripts selectively expressed in both il <dig> and ssl <dig> is closer to that of those constantly expressed, and those of the transcripts selectively expressed in f, m, and both f and m look more similar. significantly enriched go terms in the category of molecular functions are shown in table  <dig>  the top three enriched go terms of transcripts expressed constantly over all stages are zinc ion binding , protein binding , and nucleic acid binding . the top three transcripts selectively expressed in both f and m are astacin activity , a structural constituent of cuticle , and cysteine-type endopeptidase activity . these terms have all been previously associated with genes involved in parasitism  <cit> . the three most significant enriched go terms of the selectively expressed transcripts in both il <dig> and ssl <dig> are rhodopsin-like receptor activity , n-acetyltransferase activity , and sugar hydrogen symporter activity . we were only able to detect  <dig> significant terms from the transcripts exclusively expressed in f: serine-type endopeptidase activity  and glucosylceramidase activity . interesting, the most significant enriched go term of the transcripts exclusively expressed in m is serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity .

* only go terms with more than  <dig> hits to mol. function are presented.

secretory parasitism related genes in a. caninum
next we attempted to identify transcripts encoding secreted proteins associated with parasitism. of the  <dig> transcripts whose differential expression we were able to define ,  <dig> were not expressed in the preparasitic il <dig> stage but expressed in other stages , suggesting a potential role in parasitism. however, we were only able to detect a secretory signal peptide in  <dig> transcripts . this low number might underestimate the true number due to the fragmented nature of our data. another possibility is that some secretory proteins are released by alternate, poorly characterized secretory pathways, and would therefore be missed by searching for secretory peptide sequences, as was shown recently for b. malayi secreted proteins  <cit> . in addition, we found more than  <dig> transcripts with signal peptides from the transcripts that have neither b. malai nor c. elegans homologs .

intra-population polymorphism, synonymous/non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism and positive selection
due to their high evolutionary rates  <cit> , nematodes are believed to have a significant number of single nucleotide polymorphisms . a large number of sites with snp  were detected over the total  <dig> , <dig> assembled bases . since the average coverage of our transcripts is about 10×, we estimated θ  for a. caninum as  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  among the snp sites only  <dig> sites have more than two alleles. we obtained confident translations for  <dig>  cdnas containing  <dig>  of the  <dig>  snps. of these,  <dig>  were non-synonymous, and  <dig>  were synonymous, with an average dn/ds ratio of  <dig> . among the  <dig> transcripts possessing more than  <dig> polymorphic sites,  <dig> were under positive selection , and there were two functional categories identified by the associated go terms: go: <dig> . of these, one parasitism related transcript  exhibited more than  <dig> polymorphic sites and was under positive selection.

discussion
the a. caninum transcriptome was sequenced with unprecedented coverage in the present study. while fragmentation is still an issue, the non-biased cloning-free transcript sampling using the roche/ <dig> technology combined with the conventional sanger technology in this study enabled an in depth sampling of over 93% of the a. caninum transcriptome. comparing the a. caninum transcriptome with the coding sequences of c. elegans and b. malayi confirmed the high diversity of nematode transcriptomes. intra-species studies revealed high expression dynamics of the nematode transcriptome, and suggested an impact of the adaptation to parasitism on a. caninum genes and gene expression.

nematodes have higher evolutionary rate than most other eukaryotes  <cit> . only 20% of our a. caninum transcripts shared homology to c. elegans genes. since a. caninum and c. elegans are from the same phylogenetic clade  <cit> , this lowly shared homology clearly illustrates a high evolutionary rate. the high rate can lead to high polymorphism within species. our estimation of θ for a. caninum is  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  which is about  <dig> times higher than that of human coding regions  <cit> . we may have significantly underestimated θ because each final transcript is probably derived from multiple individuals rather than single worms. this high dna polymorphism is in agreement with the high evolutionary rate of a. caninum. most snps are di-allelic just as detected in human, which suggest a similar mechanism shaping snps in both human and nematodes. high mutation rate and diversity are features of the phylum nematoda. a previous survey of more than  <dig> nematode species distributed over four nematode clades found that only about 15% of sequenced ests could be found in all four nematode clades  <cit> . the same study suggested that about 30-50% of nematode genes are species specific. interestingly, our previous studies  <cit> , based on limited number of a. caninum genes , found that about 50% of the a. caninum genes had homologs in caenorhabditis species. this discrepancy is likely because the conserved genes tend to be expressed at higher levels and therefore are sequenced more deeply. the previous transcriptome studies analyzed transcripts generated using conventional cdna libraries , therefore only the most abundant transcripts were represented in those studies. in fact, when only considering the highly expressed transcripts , the homologous rate between a.caninum and c. elegans is 43%.

the high evolutionary rate and diversity of nematodes may contribute to their ability to adapt to nearly every habitat on earth  <cit> . in addition, parasitism has evolved independently at least nine times in nematodes  <cit> , and the evolution of parasitism plays a role in shaping the nematode transcriptome. the comparative genomic analysis showed that significantly more b. malayi coding genes share homology with a. caninum than with c. elegans. b. malayi is in clade iii and both a. caninum and c. elegans are in clade v, thus it is expected that b. malayi share similar homologs with a. caninum and c. elegans without parasitism adaptation. parasitic nematodes originated from non-parasites, with subsequent adaptation to the host environment. one major difference between free-living and host environments is the availability and abundance of oxygen. intestinal parasites like hookworms must adapt to the low oxygen levels in their host by using alternative energy and metabolism pathways. they also need to develop systems to evade the host defense mechanisms. the enriched go terms of the a. caninum transcripts that have homology with b. malayi genes but not with c. elegans reveal the effect of these adaptations. the most significantly enriched go term is prolyl oligopeptidase activity. prolyl oligopeptidase is a family of serine-type endopeptidases  <cit> . one of its members in the parasitic kinetoplastid, trypanosoma cruzi, is critical for the parasite to invade mammalian host cells  <cit> . another highly represented transcript is malic enzyme. malic enzyme converts malate to pyruvate in the mitochondrion, and is important for adaptation to low oxygen environment in the host  <cit> . in addition, transcripts encoding nucleic acid binding and dna binding proteins were also significantly enriched. it is possible that parasitic nematodes interfere with the host's transcription and translation system during invasion, or these transcripts encode endogenous enzymes required for further development and morphological changes that occur in the host. in contrast to the go term enrichment of these a. caninum transcripts, the b. malayi genes sharing homology with c. elegans only did not exhibit any go term enrichment.

despite the strong adaptive capability of nematodes, we failed to find evidence of strong positive selection in a. caninum. only  <dig> % of transcripts are under possible positive selection by the dn/ds test. we also failed to detect an extensive positive selection for the parasitism related genes. the lack of extensive positive selection in nematodes could suggest that these organisms have a high mutation rate. we expect our on-going nematode genomic projects to provide additional information about nematode evolution http://www.genome.gov/ <dig> 

gene expression in a. caninum is highly dynamic, with only half of the genes being constantly expressed over all four stages. this 50% is actually a conservative estimation because we excluded the transcripts that lacked sequencing depth. the most drastic difference is found among expression profiles of larvae and adults, indicating the strong effect of adaptation to the host environment. this is confirmed by the functional go term enrichments. genes selectively expressed in parasitic adults  are enriched in functions important for parasitism. in fact,  <dig> out of the  <dig> go terms enriched in parasitic adults are related to parasitism. cysteine endopeptidase is indispensable for parasites, and its numerous functions enabling parasites to defend against their hosts are well-documented  <cit> . cysteine proteases are also important for digestion of protein and hemoglobin in the blood meal  <cit> . astacin plays a crucial role in a. caninum tissue migration  <cit> . the cuticle is a protective external layer of nematodes that provides the primary defense for parasitic nematodes. several cuticlar changes associated with parasitism have been documented  <cit> . the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme is necessary for parasites to utilize host glucose as an energy source. in contrast, genes selectively expressed in larvae tend to be enriched in functions related to basic cellular functions such as oxidoreductase activity, signal transduction, and ribosome structure. the most significant term  is rhodopsin-like receptor activity, which are chemosensory receptors in c. elegans and may be required for larval nematodes to interact with their free-living environment.

surprisingly, only a small number of genes were turned on by serum stimulation, which indicate that exposure to host-like conditions in vitro does not trigger immediate gene expression changes. also, serum stimulation did not turn on expression of an increased number of parasitism related genes in our study. this suggests that hookworms do not drastically change gene expression during the transition to parasitism upon entering their hosts, i.e. many of the molecules that are released during infections are already synthesized in the il <dig> and stored for rapid release during infection  <cit> . however, using differential subtractive hybrization, datu et al  <cit>  found that the genes expressed in serum stimulated a. caninum l <dig> did not overlap with genes associated with developmental changes during recovery of c. elegans dauers, and suggested that genes expressed in response to activation with serum were involved in parasitism rather than development  <cit> . one transcript selectively expressed in ssl <dig> stage in our study encoded triacylglycerol lipase, which is known to play a role during dauer recovery in c. elegans  <cit> . invading hookworm l <dig> have been compared to recovering dauer larvae  <cit> . another group of transcripts expressed selectively in ssl <dig> versus il <dig> are the allergen v5/tpx- <dig> related proteins or ancylostoma secreted proteins , originally isolated from excretory/secretory products of a. caninum l <dig>  <cit> , and subsequently from numerous other nematodes. while its function is unknown, a second, related set of asps have been described from the adult stages  <cit> , and were among the most abundant transcripts in adult m and f in this study . overall, expression dynamics correlated with progression through the stages of the life cycle.

genes with different evolutionary conservation exhibit different expression pattern. genes conserved among nematodes tend to be expressed consistently in all stages, and a. caninum specific genes tend to be expressed more selectively. these expression patterns can be associated with their corresponding functions. conserved genes are involved in basic cellular activities and thus are required for all stages. species-specific genes are functionally more closely related to the specific life cycle stage and niche. for example, the il <dig> selective transcripts are mainly a. caninum specific and are depleted of primary metabolic process  and macromolecule metabolic process  . in addition, the parasitism related genes are more like to be selectively expressed in adult stages. one would expect this since the adults are parasitic whereas the infective larvae are usually free-living. we found that the male adult differentially expressed transcripts are enriched in serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity. the male reproductive tract of mammals is enriched in peptidase inhibitors that function in protection and regulation of fertilization  <cit> , suggesting a similar mechanism may be at work in nematodes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study allowed generation and cataloging of all genes expressed in four transcriptomes of a. caninum. our analysis segregated those genes in multiple dimensions including functional, developmental and phylogenetic categories. the observations agreed with, but also extended, information on previously described genes, suggesting that the newly discovered genes will provide additional unique value. this information identified sets of stage-specific genes, as well as pre-parasitic and parasitic genes that defined differences in metabolic and cellular processes between stages. furthermore, parasitic adaptation has been shown to be related to transcriptome diversity and developmental dynamics. this dataset is a resource for more complete microarrays, rt-pcr, rna interference and proteomics. the latter can identify parasite proteins that occur in specific developmental stages, parasite excretory-secretory products, and the external cuticular surface. in addition, the cdnas generated will enable better annotation of the upcoming genome sequence http://www.genome.gov/ <dig>  such extended genomic studies will aid in the identification of genes involved in host recognition, infection, migration and immune invasion as well as the categorization of targets for vaccine and anthelmintic drugs. finally, the methodology developed in this study illustrates the effectiveness of deep sequencing as a means for analyzing differential gene expression.
