BACKGROUND
micrornas are short  non-protein coding rna sequences that are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes either by mrna cleavage and degradation or by repressing the translation of mrna into proteins. though they are a relatively recent discovery, they are of immense biological interest given their regulatory role in numerous cellular processes, e.g. some mirnas can act as oncogenes or tumor-suppressors in humans  <cit> .

the identification of regulatory mirnas and their target mrnas is a major combinatorial challenge because a single mirna regulates multiple mrnas and several mirnas co-regulate a single mrna. the many-to-many relationship between mirnas and mrnas results in a powerful ability for mirnas to control cellular protein output and function. therefore, methods which are able to discover these mirna-based regulations may provide a means for identifying the key cellular pathways that contribute to a biological event, such as the initiation of cancer. one of the widely used methods for the identification of regulatory mirnas is based on mrna microarray expression data. firstly, the putative mirna-mrna  pairs are identified using a prediction algorithm such as targetscans  <cit> , pictar  <cit>  or miranda  <cit> . these algorithms are based on mirna and mrna sequence data and return thousands of putative mirmr pairs. secondly, a gene set test   is performed to determine whether, for a given mirna, the predicted target mrnas have expression values different from that for the remaining mrnas. an mirna is considered to be regulatory if the gst returns a statistically significant p-value.

another method was proposed by jayaswal et al.  <cit>  and is, henceforth, referred to as the odds-ratio  method. the or method determines whether there is an association between mirna expression and that of its computationally predicted target mrnas. if the association is statistically significant, then the mirna is considered to be regulatory. unlike the gst, the or method is based on the expression data from both mirnas and mrnas. while both methods identify individual mirnas as potentially regulatory, they ignore the biological observation that a group of mirnas may co-regulate a group of mrnas. another limitation of the two methods is that the identification of regulatory mirnas does not provide information about the mirmr pairs of interest and these pairs have to be identified separately. since the experimental validation of an mirna's regulatory role requires an observable  change in the expression of its target mrnas, the knowledge of mirmr pairs is essential.

we denote a group of mirnas and mrnas as a module if the mirnas in a group regulate the mrnas in the same group. one of the earliest methods for the identification of mirmr modules was proposed by yoon and de micheli  <cit> . this method is based on computationally predicted mirmr pairs and does not utilize mirna or mrna expression data. since mirnas that are regulatory in one experimental scenario may not be regulatory in another, e.g. mirnas that are regulatory in breast cancer may not be regulatory in other types of cancer, this method is of limited use.

recently, a few integrative methods  have been developed to obtain mirmr modules. for example, joung and fei  <cit>  used a combination of putative mirmr pairs and mrna expression data to identify mirmr modules. a limitation of their method is that the correlation between mirna and mrna expression data, which provides statistical evidence for a mirmr pair being regulatory, is not considered. joung et al.  <cit>  proposed an evolutionary algorithm based method for identifying mirmr modules. while the authors considered correlation among the mirnas or mrnas in a module, they ignored the correlation between mirnas and mrnas. therefore, their method has the same limitation as joung and fei's method. peng et al.  <cit>  proposed a method based on the correlation between mirna and mrna expression data and this method is, henceforth, referred to as the peng-li method. the authors calculated the correlation coefficients for all computationally predicted mirmr pairs followed by the selection of mirmr pairs that had a statistically significant negative correlation. next, the negatively correlated mirmr pairs were grouped to obtain modules such that each mirna in a module targeted all the mrnas in the module. the major limitation of the peng-li method is that the mirnas and mrnas in a module are not required to be enriched  in terms of their predicted targets and regulators, respectively. for example, though mirnas belonging to the same family are similar in terms of their target mrnas , the peng-li method does not take this into account while grouping mirnas. another limitation is that the identification of modules is based on a negative correlation between mirnas and mrnas. since some recent studies  <cit>  have shown that mirnas and their target mrnas do not always share a negative correlation, a measure of association that incorporates both directions of change is desirable.

to this end, we propose a novel mirmr module identification method that has two components - the first component is the identification of mirna and mrna clusters and the second component is the estimation of association between the two types of clusters. the mirna and mrna clusters with statistically significant associations represent the potentially regulatory mirmr modules. in the next section, we describe our method and illustrate the method's ability to identify biologically meaningful mirmr modules using a matched mirna and mrna microarray data set.

RESULTS
novel mirmr module identification method
we propose a two-step method  for the identification of mirmr modules. the first step involves the identification of mirna and mrna clusters that are enriched in terms of target mrnas and regulators, respectively. the mrna  clusters are obtained using computationally predicted mirmr pairs and mrna  expression data. the second step involves the identification of mirna clusters that have a statistically significant association to one or more of the mrna clusters. these associations are obtained using matched mirna and mrna expression data.

step1: clustering
the clustering of mirnas or mrnas requires two input parameters - a measure of dissimilarity between mirnas or mrnas and the number of clusters, k. once a dissimilarity measure has been obtained, clustering is performed using the partition around medoids  <cit>  algorithm. we note that other clustering algorithms, e.g. a hierarchical clustering algorithm  <cit> , can also be used in our module identification method. in the rest of this subsection, we focus on the generation of mrna clusters and note that a similar approach can be used for the generation of mirna clusters. we refer to a matrix m = , where  <dig> ≤ s ≤ c and  <dig> ≤ w ≤ d, as a c × d matrix and an element msw of the matrix as .

one measure of dissimilarity is the euclidean distance between pairs of mrnas. we obtain this using a mirmr map matrix of the form y × x, where y denotes the number of mrnas and x denotes the number of mirnas. if an mirna i is predicted to target an mrna j, then the element  of the map matrix takes the value  <dig> and  <dig>  otherwise. henceforth, we refer to the clustering based on euclidean distances as unguided clustering or clustun.

the unguided clustering does not take into account changes in mrna expression profiles. if only mirmr pairs are considered, then the euclidean distance between an mrna  and two or more clusters may be identical. rather than picking one of the clusters at random, we can use mrna expression profiles to guide m <dig> to the cluster whose members have the expression profiles closest to m <dig>  therefore, a measure of dissimilarity that combines mrna expression profiles with predicted mirmr pairs is desirable. henceforth, we refer to the clustering based on these pairwise measures of dissimilarity as guided clustering or clustgd.

our guided clustering method  is based on multivariate random forest   <cit>  and requires two input matrices - a y × x mirmr map matrix and a y × t matrix of mrna expression values, where t denotes the number of conditions . in addition to the two matrices, the following three parameters are required -

 node_size: a node is defined as a collection of mrnas and splitting a node results in child nodes. the child nodes, in turn, are split further till a terminating condition is reached. the terminating condition is that the number of mrnas at a node should be greater than a user-defined cut-off value. we refer to this cut-off value as node_size.

 number of trees : if splitting a node, say pn, results in two child nodes, say cn <dig> and cn <dig>  and the number of mrnas in either of the two child nodes is less than node_size, then the node pn is not split further. a node, e.g. pn in the above example, that is not split is referred to as a terminal node. a binary tree that is obtained by splitting each node  into exactly two child nodes is referred to as a regression tree. if t =  <dig>  then the regression tree is referred to as a univariate regression tree, otherwise it is referred to as a multivariate regression tree  <cit> . we denote a collection of multivariate regression trees as a mrf and n refers to the number of trees in the forest.

 num_cov: for a multivariate regression tree, the function used to obtain the child nodes is i, where  is an element of the map matrix y × x and i takes the value one if mirna i targets mrna j and the value  <dig>  otherwise. in other words, if a column i of the y × x matrix is used to split a node, say bn, into two child nodes, then all the mrnas that are targeted by mirna i constitute one child node and all the remaining mrnas constitute the second child node. however, there are x different mirnas and, therefore, x different ways in which the child nodes, say dn <dig> and dn <dig>  can be obtained from bn. let h denote the mirna that is actually used to split the node bn and let xl denote the vector of expression values for the lth mrna. in other words, xl corresponds to the lth row of the expression matrix y × t. let qm denote the set of mrnas at node θ and xavg denote the vector of average expression values for the mrnas in qm. let d denotes the euclidean distance between the vectors xl and xavg and let s=∑l∈qm{d} <dig> denote a measure of node homogeneity, i.e. the closeness of mrnas in terms of their expression profiles. let f = s - s - s denote the change in node homogeneity when a node bn is split into child nodes dn <dig> and dn <dig>  since there are x mirnas, we obtain x different values of f and h refers to the mirna that returns the highest value . in practice, owing to time constraint, it is not feasible to test all the x mirnas and determine h. instead, a randomly chosen subset of the x mirnas is used to obtain h. we denote the number of mirnas in the subset as num_cov. we typically set num_cov equal to the square root of the number of mirnas, as recommended by xiao and segal  <cit> .

the multivariate regression tree is used to obtain a y × y matrix, henceforth referred to as the proximity matrix. each element of the proximity matrix takes the value  <dig> or  <dig>  if two mrnas, say a and b, belong to the same terminal node, then  =  <dig>  else  =  <dig>  though the proximity matrix obtained using a regression tree has low prediction accuracy, the use of a collection of trees greatly improves the prediction accuracy  <cit> . therefore, we calculate the proximity matrix for the mrf. if the mrf has n trees, then the element  of the mrf proximity matrix is obtained using the formula ∑g=1ng/n, where g is the value for the gth regression tree. while the mrf proximity matrix  measures the similarity between mrnas,  <dig> - proxmatrix, where  <dig> denotes a y×y matrix with every element equal to  <dig>  measures the dissimilarity between mrnas. this dissimilarity matrix is provided as an input for clustgd .

once the mrna clusters have been obtained using clustun or clustgd, we determine the clusters where the mrnas are closer to one another than by chance. let es denote the enrichment score and k denote the total number of clusters. now, for a given cluster k =  <dig>  ..., k, esk=∑o∈kd/nk. here, nk denotes the number of elements in cluster k, om denotes the median value of the elements in the kth cluster and d denotes the euclidean distance between an element o, which belongs to cluster k, and om. we note that o and om are obtained using the relevant rows of the matrix y × x. we perform a non-parametric bootstrap test to determine whether esk can be obtained by chance. firstly, we obtain  <dig> random clusters of size nk using sampling without replacement, i.e. the same mrna does not occur more than once in a random cluster. secondly, we obtain w <dig>  the number of times the enrichment score for a random cluster of size nk is smaller than or equal to esk. if w1/ <dig> <  <dig> , then esk cannot be obtained by chance and the kth cluster is considered to be statistically significant or enriched.

let prenrich denote the percentage of clusters that are enriched. therefore, prenrich = nenrich/ntotal, where nenrich denotes the number of enriched clusters and ntotal ≤ k denotes the total number of clusters of size greater than one. we only consider clusters of size greater than one because we are interested in mrnas that are co-targeted and, hence, co-regulated by a small group of mirnas. the prenrich values are used to compare the results obtained using clustun and clustgd. the clustering method that returns a higher value of prenrich is used to obtain the mrna clusters that are provided as an input to step  <dig> of our method.

step 2: identification of statistically significant modules
let rmir and rgene denote the number of enriched mirna and mrna clusters, respectively. now the number of possible mirmr modules is rmir × rgene. for each module, we obtain the number of mirmr pairs with an association. a mirmr pair is considered to have an association if the pair is computationally predicted, i.e. the y × x map matrix has the value  <dig> for the relevant mirmr pair, and there is evidence of a change in mirna expression producing a change in mrna expression. to test the latter condition, we assume a linear model of the form u = α + βv, where u denotes the change in mrna expression, v denotes the change in mirna expression, α denotes the change in mrna expression that is independent of a change in mirna expression, and β denotes the change in mrna expression due to a unit change in mirna expression. we estimate the values of α and β using matched mirna and mrna expression profiles; the expression profiles correspond to normalized log <dig> fold-change values with respect to a reference. next, we test the null hypothesis that β =  <dig> versus the alternate hypothesis that β ≠  <dig> using a t-test. if the p-value <  <dig> , then there is evidence that a change in mirna expression produces a change in mrna expression.

one advantage of the linear model is that it allows for changes in mirna and mrna expression to be in the same direction or opposite direction. however, with a slight modification, we can test the one-sided hypothesis that a change in mirna expression produces a change in mrna expression in the opposite direction. another advantage is that it is computationally faster than the use of correlation coefficient as a measure of association between a mirmr pair. typically, the statistical significance of correlation coefficient is obtained using a non-parametric bootstrap test. in contrast, the statistical significance of β is determined using a pre-computed table of significance for t-test.

let nmmir denote the number of mirnas in the mth mirna cluster and let nngene denote the number of mrnas in the nth mrna cluster. let assoc denote the number of mirmr pairs in the  module with an association. we determine the statistical significance of association between the mth mirna cluster and nth mrna cluster using a non-parametric bootstrap test. firstly, we obtain  <dig> randomly generated mrna clusters of size nngene. secondly, we obtain assoc, where n* denotes a randomly generated cluster of size nngene. thirdly, we obtain w <dig>  the number of times assoc is greater than or equal to assoc. if w2/ <dig> <  <dig> , then the association between the mth mirna cluster and nth mrna is considered to be statistically significant. we consider the  mirmr module to be potentially regulatory if  the association between the mth mirna cluster and nth mrna cluster is statistically significant and  each mirna in the mth cluster targets a majority of mrnas in the nth cluster.

in the next subsection, we compare the results obtained using clustun and clustgd. we tried different values for node_size and num_cov and obtained the best prenrich values for node_size =  <dig> and num_cov =  <dig> . also, we set n =  <dig> as a further increase in the number of trees did not alter the results.

guided vs. unguided clustering
we used a publicly available leukemia data set  <cit>  to compare clustun and clustgd. this data set contained the mrna expression profiles of healthy donors and multiple myeloma  patients belonging to four categories - no cytogenetic abnormality, cytogenetic abnormality t , cytogenetic abnormality t , and rb deletion as a unique cytogenetic abnormality. we identified  <dig> differentially expressed  mrnas; an mrna was considered to be de if the average expression profile of healthy donors was different from that of patients in one or more categories. of the  <dig> de mrnas, we could obtain the plausible mirmr pairs for only  <dig> mrnas using a combination of four mirmr target-prediction databases - mirbase  <cit> , pictar, targetscans and mirgen  <cit>   and targetscans). in other words, the mirmr mapping information was available for only  <dig> % of the de mrnas. also, the total number of mirnas that targeted one or more of the  <dig> de mrnas was  <dig> 

we converted this mirmr mapping information into a  <dig> ×  <dig> map matrix such that the rows and columns of the matrix corresponded to mrnas and mirnas, respectively. an element  of this matrix took the value  <dig> or  <dig> depending on whether the jth mrna was targeted by the ith mirna or not. next, we obtained the log <dig> fold-change values for leukemia patients with respect to healthy donors and derived the  <dig>  ×  <dig>  expression matrix. while the map matrix was provided as input to both clustun and clustgd, the expression matrix was provided as input to only clustgd.

for clustgd, the best prenrich value was 80% and it was obtained for two values of k - <dig> and  <dig>  for clustun, the best prenrich value was  <dig> % and it was obtained for k =  <dig>  this shows that an iterative approach, wherein several k values are tried, is required to obtain the best prenrich value. overall, the prenrich values for clustgd were higher than that for clustun in  <dig> % of the cases.

the mrna clusters can be obtained using pam or a hierarchical clustering algorithm. to compare the results obtained using the two clustering algorithms, we provided the output of mrf as an input to an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm  <cit> . we varied k from  <dig> to  <dig> in increments of  <dig> and compared the prenrich values with those obtained earlier using pam. the clusters obtained using pam had a higher prenrich value for each value of k .

identification of mirmr modules
we used a second data set, a timecourse study with matched mirna and mrna microarray expression profiles, to illustrate our module-identification method. this data set corresponded to a drug study for mm patients  <cit>  and had six time points -  <dig>   <dig> hrs,  <dig> hrs,  <dig> hrs,  <dig> hrs, and  <dig> hrs. we identified  <dig> de mrnas, i.e. mrnas for which the changes in expression profile over the timecourse were statistically significant. we could obtain plausible mirmr pairs for only  <dig>  of the de mrnas and the total number of mirnas that targeted one or more of the  <dig> mrnas was  <dig>  therefore, for this data set, we obtained a  <dig> ×  <dig> mirmr map matrix and a  <dig>  ×  <dig>  expression matrix. the expression matrix had five time points because time point  <dig> was used as reference to obtain the log <dig> fold-change values.

as for the leukemia data set, we obtained the mrna clusters using clustun and clustgd. we varied k from  <dig> to  <dig> in intervals of  <dig> and the average cluster size varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the prenrich values for clustgd were higher than or equal to that for clustun in 70% of the cases . this result was similar to that obtained for the previous example. while clustgd returned clusters of size greater than one for every value of k, clustun returned a few clusters of size one for k ≥  <dig>  the best prenrich values obtained using clustgd and clustun were 84% and  <dig> %, respectively. overall, the highest prenrich value was 84% corresponding to k =  <dig> and these  <dig>  mrna clusters were used in step  <dig>  of the module-identification method.

in addition to the mrna clusters, step  <dig> requires mirna clusters as an input. we obtained  <dig> de mirnas and of these de mirnas, only  <dig> were found to target one or more of the  <dig> mrnas. therefore, for mirna clustering using clustgd and clustun, we used the  <dig>  ×  <dig>  map matrix and a  <dig>  ×  <dig>  expression matrix. we obtained prenrich values for k varying between  <dig> and  <dig> in intervals of  <dig>  for this range of values, the average cluster size varied from  <dig> to  <dig> . both clustgd and clustun returned the same prenrich value for k ≥  <dig>  the best value of prenrich was  <dig> % and this was obtained for several values of k; the smallest of these values was  <dig>  for k =  <dig>  the clusters returned by clustgd and clustun were similar except for the grouping of mir- <dig>  this mirna belonged to a cluster of size one and  <dig>  respectively, for clustgd and clustun. the mirna clusters obtained using k =  <dig> for clustun were provided as input to step  <dig>  of the module-identification method. we chose clustun because it is the simpler of the two clustering methods and returned the same prenrich value as that for clustgd. we obtained  <dig> mirna clusters as potentially regulatory. these included clusters of size one because even a single mirna can regulate multiple mrnas.

next, we determined the associations between mirna clusters and mrna clusters. while the linear model described earlier can be used to obtain positive or negative associations, we considered only negative associations because mirnas act as negative regulators of their direct targets. for each of the  <dig>  mirmr modules, we determined the statistical significance of association using a non-parametric bootstrap test and obtained a total of nine potentially regulatory modules ; see additional file 1: "supplementary data" for the list of genes in each module. a potentially regulatory mirmr module contained one or more mirnas. however, only a small fraction of the mrnas that were predicted as targets of these mirnas was present in the module . the five mirna clusters that had more than one element and belonged to one or more of the nine potentially regulatory modules were -  mir-135a and mir-135b,  mir-148a and mir-148b,  mir-15b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>   mir-30b, mir-30c and mir- <dig> d,  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> .

biological implication and interpretation
to examine the biological significance of the statistically significant mrna clusters obtained using clustgd, we performed a gene ontology over-representation analysis using david  <cit> . we observed that approximately 12% of the mrna clusters were enriched for gene ontology terms . specifically, the mrna clusters were enriched for - apoptosis , endomembrane system , membrane fraction , symporter activity , and protein phosphatase binding . in addition, one of the clusters was enriched for genes in the endocytosis biochemical pathway. in the apoptosis cluster, rac <dig> was a gene of interest as little is known about the role of rac <dig> in myeloma and its progression. rac <dig> signalling plays a critical role in apoptosis and tumorigenesis and has been shown to impair p53-deficient lymphoma cell growth  <cit> . indeed, blockage of rac <dig> induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in breast cancer cells  <cit> . in the biochemical pathway cluster, cxcr <dig> was a gene of interest. this gene is one of the key members of endocytosis biochemical pathway and has been shown to have clinical significance. specifically, the expression of this chemokine receptor, in addition to ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  is correlated with disease state and survival in myeloma patients  <cit> .

next, we focused on the potentially regulatory mirmr modules. the statistically significant mirmr module containing the mirnas mir-15b, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> had  <dig> mrnas; the mirmr map matrix predicted  <dig> of these mrnas as targets of all three mirnas. even though all the mirmr pairs in this module were not observed to have a statistically significant association, grouping these mrnas and mirnas together reflects the predicted regulatory role of the three mirnas vis-à-vis the  <dig> mrnas.

although mir-15a was not identified as de over the timecourse, mir-15b and mir-15a shared 98% of their target mrnas . this implies that the net effect of a change in the expression of mir-15a and mir-15b on cellular biology would be similar. mir-15a and mir- <dig> have been previously identified as an oncogenic cluster that is frequently deleted in chronic lymphocytic leukemia  <cit> . the clustering of these two mirnas suggests that our method is able to identify biologically relevant mirna clusters. in addition to the identification of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> cluster as important in the pathogenesis of a number of malignancies, the mechanisms explaining their role have also been described in literature. this cluster has been shown to modulate multidrug resistance  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit>  and cellular proliferation  <cit> . the role of this cluster in controlling the proliferation of the cell is due to the targeting of several key cell-cycle genes such as cyclin d <dig>  <cit>  and cyclin e <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, mir- <dig> was identified as belonging to the same cluster as mir-15b and mir- <dig>  suggesting that mir- <dig> may play a role in cell-cycle in a similar manner to mir-15b and mir- <dig>  this implied function was confirmed in a study by xu et al.  <cit> , where ectopic expression of mir- <dig> blocked cell cycle progression by regulating rb-e2f signaling possibly via an interaction with cyclin d.

our analysis may also have the ability to identify other interactions that were not previously identified, thereby, providing further information on complex gene regulatory pathways. the mirnas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> induce apoptosis by suppressing the anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  <cit> , and both mirnas were found to target a cluster of mrnas containing among others, g0s <dig> and bfar. g0s <dig> has previously been shown to interact with bcl- <dig> and promote apoptosis by preventing the formation of bcl-2/bax heterodimers  <cit> , and bfar has been shown to bind to bcl- <dig>  <cit> .

effect of expression data on mirmr modules
for a matched mirna and mrna microarray expression data set, the mirna and mrna clusters correspond to groups of de mirnas and mrnas, respectively, which are present in the mirmr map matrix. our timecourse data set comprised patients with mm and we tested the null hypothesis that the expression pattern of a biological entity  was the same at all time points. if there was evidence against the null hypothesis, then we considered the biological entity to be de. in contrast, the mm data set of gutierrez et al.  <cit>   comprised healthy individuals and patients belonging to four categories of cytogenetic abnormalities. we tested the null hypothesis that the expression pattern of a biological entity was the same in all categories of mm patients and in healthy individuals. if there was evidence against the null hypothesis, then we considered the biological entity to be de. since the null hypotheses were different for the two data sets, the resulting de biological entities  were different as well. for example, while mir-15b was de in the timecourse data set, mir-15a was de in the gutierrez et al. data set.

for the timecourse data set, the number of de mrnas and mirnas that were present in the mirmr map matrix was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. for the gutierrez et al. data set, the number of de mrnas and mirnas that were present in the mirmr map matrix was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. since the de mirnas and mrnas that were provided as input for clustering were different for the two data sets, the mirmr modules obtained using the two data sets were different. for example, we identified a module comprising mir-30b, mir-30c, and mir- <dig> d using the timecourse data set and a module comprising mir-30a-5p, mir-30b, mir-30c, mir- <dig> d, and mir-30e-5p using the gutierrez et al. data set . similarly, for the timecourse data set, we identified a mirmr module comprising mir-15b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  in contrast, for the gutierrez et al. data set, we identified a mirmr module comprising mir-15a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  while the mirmr module  identified using the timecourse data set had  <dig> mrnas, the module identified using the gutierrez et al. data set had  <dig> mrnas. of these,  <dig> mrnas were common to both modules.

clustering mirnas from different families
to determine whether mirnas from different families could be grouped together, we modified the mirmr map matrix so that it contained only one mirna from each family. the number of co-targeted mrnas in the modified mirmr map matrix was used to determine the distances between mirna families. next, these distances were used to obtain clusters of mirna families. for the timecourse data set, the median number of mrnas that were co-targeted by two mirna families was one. this implied that the distance between any two mirna families was too large for the families to be clustered together. indeed, we observed that none of the clusters with two or more mirnas were statistically significant.

we generated the mirmr map matrix using a combination of four target-prediction algorithms - miranda , pictar, targetscans and mirgen  and targetscans). for these algorithms, the number of co-targeted mrnas obtained using mirnas from the same family was higher than obtained using mirnas from different families. consequently, the mirna clusters and, hence, the mirmr modules contained mirnas from the same family. it may be possible to obtain mirmr modules comprising mirnas from different families using a target-prediction algorithm such as targetminer  <cit> . to illustrate this, we reanalyzed the timecourse data set using a mirmr map matrix based on targetminer. the new mirmr map matrix corresponded to  <dig> de mirnas and  <dig> de mrnas. the value of k, corresponding to the highest prenrich value, for mirnas and mrnas was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. while the number of enriched mirna clusters  was  <dig>  the number of enriched mrna clusters was  <dig>  therefore, the number of possible mirmr modules was  <dig>  and nine of these were found to be statistically significant . we observed that two of the statistically significant mirmr modules contained mirnas from different families - hsa-mir-302b, hsa-mir- <dig>  and hsa-mir-520e.

discussion
we present a method for identifying regulatory modules - mirna clusters that potentially regulate mrna clusters. while some methods, e.g.  <cit>  can be used to obtain mirna and mrna clusters without matched mirmr expression data, our results show that matched expression data is necessary for identifying the cluster pairs  of potential biological interest. for example, the mirnas - mir-15b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> co-target  <dig> mrnas  and less than 25% of these  were included in a potentially regulatory mirmr module. the remaining co-targets belonged to other mrna clusters and were not found to have a statistically significant association to the mirna cluster .

our method enables the identification of mrna clusters that are co-regulated by multiple mirnas as well as those that are regulated by just one mirna. since the mirna clusters are derived from the mirmr map matrix, mirnas that share very few co-targets with other mirnas belong to clusters of size one. if a mirna is not statistically similar  to other mirnas, then the associated mrna cluster is regulated by just one mirna. on the other hand, if two or more mirnas are statistically similar , then the associated mrna cluster is co-regulated by multiple mirnas.

our method can be used to identify mirmr pairs that have a negative or positive association. a positive association may be indicative of an indirect relationship between the mirmr pair, e.g. ritchie et al.  <cit>  showed a positive association between hsa-mir- <dig> and pcna. therefore, our method can be used to obtain mirmr modules that represent either direct regulation or indirect regulation of mrnas. the current measure of association can also be extended to capture other desired and more complex relationships. for example, in case of timecourse data, there may be a time lag between changes in mirna expression and that of its target mrnas. since the output of our method is a network of interactions between mirnas and mrnas, capturing the time-lag information can enable the identification of variations in modules over time. these time-dependent modules could perhaps be used as an initial step in the construction of gene regulatory networks.

a potentially regulatory mirmr module has a statistically significant association between the mirna cluster and mrna cluster. however, every mirmr pair in the module is not required to have a statistically significant association. this may enable us to identify relationships that were hitherto hidden owing to the noise in expression data. the module comprising  <dig> mrnas and three mirnas  had mrnas  with a statistically significant negative association to all three mirnas. in contrast, some mrnas  had a statistically significant negative association to only mir- <dig>  since these associations were obtained using a short timecourse data set , which has the problem of noise, we recommend that all three mirnas be considered as co-regulators of the four mrnas. unlike our method, the peng-li method requires every mirmr pair in a module to have a statistically significant association. therefore, the peng-li method would split the  <dig> mrnas into several modules, e.g. the four mrnas that had a negative association to only mir- <dig> would form one module. in this regard, the peng-li method can be treated as a special case of our method.

we note that the mirmr modules will vary based on the input mirmr map matrix. for the timecourse data set, the mirmr modules obtained using a combination of miranda, pictar, targetscans and mirgen were different from that obtained using targetminer. for a mirmr module containing multiple mirnas, all the mirnas could be from the same family. this is because the mirnas from the same family share multiple targets in the map matrix. it is possible to change the map matrix and consider mirna families instead of individual mirnas. this would ensure that a mirmr module with multiple mirnas contains mirnas from different families. however, such a map matrix should be considered only if the mirnas in a family have similar expression profiles. otherwise, the association between individual mirnas in the family and mrna would vary, resulting in a weak  overall association between the mirna family and mrna. this, in turn, would reduce the number of enriched mirmr modules.

CONCLUSIONS
we present a mirmr module identification method that facilitates better biological interpretation of high-throughput mirna and mrna microarray data. a typical analysis of microarray data returns numerous mrnas  and mirnas  as de. since each de mirna potentially targets hundreds of de mrnas, the number of potential mirmr interactions exceeds  <dig> , <dig>  our method converts this massive amount of information into a small number of potentially regulatory mirmr modules, thereby, enabling biologists to identify the mirnas and mrnas for further experimentation. for example, for the timecourse data set, our method reduced the number of potential mirmr interactions from over  <dig> , <dig> to just nine mirmr modules.
