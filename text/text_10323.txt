BACKGROUND
denv is member of the genus flavivirus. a sequence variation of 30% to 35% allows denv to be divided into four related but antigenically distinct serotypes . denv represents a major arthropod-borne pathogen, leading to  <dig> million infections every year, mostly in the tropical and subtropical countries. denv infection may cause a spectrum of clinical diseases, such as self-limited dengue fever , potentially life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever  and dengue shock syndrome   <cit> . in particular, the frequency of severe denv infection in travelers visiting dengue endemic regions is similar to that of secondary infection in dengue endemic zones  <cit> . although many studies have attempted to develop promising strategies, a specific antiviral agent to denv infection or an approved vaccine remains unavailable  <cit> .

the main obstacle to develop vaccines or specific antiviral therapies to denv infection is that the immunopathogenesis of denv infection is still not well known. infection with one serotype can increase disease severity upon secondary infection with other serotypes. additionally, infants born to dengue-immune mothers carries an increased risk of severe disease upon primary infection  <cit> . one explanation of severe denv infections is the hypothesis of ade  <cit> . according to this hypothesis, cross-reactive antibodies at sub-neutralizing concentrations generated during a primary infection has been suggested to enhance the subsequent infections by facilitating efficient binding and cell entry of virus-antibody complexes into fc receptor-bearing cells  <cit> . therefore, an effective dengue vaccine must provide a protective long-lasting immune response to all four serotypes; otherwise, vaccination itself could lead to additional risks. to date, clinical trials of dengue vaccine candidates did not show any ade related to vaccination. however, it is necessary to ensure that infection enhancement will not occur in vaccinated population some time due to waning immunity  <cit> . increased disease severity appears to associate with high viral load, suggesting that antibodies have an influence on the infectious properties of the virus. the viral load in secondary infection patients without severe disease is similar to that in primary infection patients  <cit> . however, it has been reported that pre-existing antibody in infants did not correlate with increased viremia and disease severity  <cit> . in addition, it has also been demonstrated asymptomatic healthy blood donors with high dengue viremia did not have detectable antibody  <cit> . to date, understanding of the molecular mechanism of ade has been severely hampered by the lack of an ideal animal model and is still a mystery. consequently, there have been few reports to provide in vivo evidence of ade of denv infection  <cit> . in spite of that, it has been proved that ag <dig> mouse model could cause many similarities with specific features of human denv infection and thus may be an appropriate animal model for the investigation of ade in vivo  <cit> .

denv is an enveloped, positive-stranded rna virus and it encodes three structural proteins  and seven nonstructural  proteins   <cit> . the initial assembly of denv particles occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum by formation of immature virions, which contain heterodimers of the e and prm. the prm protein is a 166-amino-acid protein, which is believed to acts as a chaperone for correct folding and assembly of the e protein  <cit> . subsequently, the viral envelope proteins are believed to undergo conformational changes triggered by the low ph in trans-golgi network . then the endoprotease furin cleaves prm into m that remains associated with the virus particle and an n-terminal 91-amino-acid peptide  that dissociates upon release of the virus from the infected cell, resulting in the formation of mature virions  <cit> . the cleavage of prm to m is required for denv maturation and infectivity.

many studies have shown that prm-specific antibodies could mediate denv-specific immune response in humans  <cit> . these prm-specific mabs are highly cross-reactive among four denv serotypes and, even at high concentrations, do not neutralize infection but potently promote ade infection over a broad range of concentration  <cit> . it has also been suggested that anti-prm antibodies could render essentially non-infectious imdenv highly infectious  <cit> . recent studies in infants have also implicated that anti-prm antibodies could lead to severe disease upon primary infection  <cit> . these studies on human and mouse anti- prm mabs  <cit>  suggest that this class of antibodies have a significant role to enhance denv infection in humans. however, most of the epitopes recognized by these prm-specific antibodies remain unclear.

viral protein epitopes are pivotal in the pathogenesis of virus infection and in the development of effective vaccines  <cit> . therefore, the identification of b-cell epitopes for denv prm antibodies can provide important information for the understanding of the pathogenesis of denv infection and contribute to the development of dengue vaccine. in the case of denv, many efforts have been made into mapping the epitopes of e protein  <cit> , but only a few epitopes have been identified on prm protein  <cit> . consequently, the precise antigenic structures of prm and their functions in the immune response and infection pathogenesis remain poorly studied.

in the present study, the epitope recognized by prm mab 4d <dig> was identified using a phage-displayed peptide library and comprehensive bioinformatic analysis. we investigated the neutralizing versus enhancing capacity of the mab 4d <dig> and antisera of epitope peptide pl <dig> towards standard denv1- <dig> particles and imdenv particles. we found that 4d <dig> and antibody against epitope peptide pl <dig> showed broad cross-reactivity and poor neutralizing acvitity with the four standard denv serotypes but significantly enhanced the infectious properties. in addition, these antibodies remained susceptible to partially neutralizing imdenv and indeed rendered virtually non-infectious imdenv highly infectious in fc receptor-bearing cells. taken together, we identified a novel infection-enhancing epitope on prm protein. these results may provide some important implications for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of denv infection and advance the development of dengue vaccine.

immunization assay and protection assay in adult balb/c mice
all procedures involving animals were approved by the animal experimentation ethics committee of sun yat-sen university and carried out by a licensed individual with an ethical approval number of 2012/ <dig> 

animals were purchased from the center of experimental animal of the sun yat-sen university. four groups , each comprising of ten adult female balb/c mice , were intraperitoneally injected with  <dig> μg of immunogen emulsified in complete freund’s adjuvant for the first immunization. mice were then injected at week  <dig> and  <dig> with the peptides and freund’s incomplete adjuvant. the mice were bled on week  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> via tail vein according to nc3rs standard procedures, and the anti-peptide antibody titer of mice sera was determined by elisa.

two weeks after the last immunization, mice were infected with denv <dig> ngc strain  through peritoneal injection. blood samples were collected at day  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> via tail vein according to nc3rs standard procedures. then, all animals were euthanized by using carbon dioxide  according to nc3rs standard procedures and the experiment was terminated. viral rna was extracted from  <dig> μl serum aliquots using qiaamp viral rna mini kit . the viral rna copy numbers were quantified by qrt-pcr.

western blot analysis
denv infected c6/ <dig> cells were treated with 1% triton x- <dig>  the lysates were run on 12% sds polyacryramide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride  membranes . the membranes were then blocked with pbs containing 5% skimmed milk and probed with prm-specific antibodies for  <dig> h at room temperature. subsequently, membranes were detected with hrp-conjugated anti-mouse igg and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents .

indirect immunofluorescence assay 
c6/ <dig> cells were infected with denv1- <dig> and jev. cells were then fixed with acetone at −20°c for  <dig> min and washed three times with pbs. cells were incubated with a 100-fold dilution of prm-specific antibodies. after  <dig> min of incubation at 37°c, cells were washed three times with pbs. cells were then reacted with a 200-fold dilution of alexa-fluor-488-conjugated anti–mouse igg  for  <dig> min at 37°c, washed five times with pbs. after washing, cells were treated with dapi and detected using a fluorescent microscope.

real-time quantitative rt-pcr 
viral rna copy numbers were quantified by qrt-pcr as described previously  <cit> . briefly, viral rna was extracted from  <dig> μl serum aliquots using qiaamp viral rna mini kit . denv1- <dig> serotypes universal primers  and probe , based on 3' noncoding region of denv <dig> strain hawaii , were selected by using primer express software. cdna was synthesized from viral rna  by using primescript® rt reagent kit . dna was amplified for  <dig> cycles  by using premix ex taq™ . the concentration of viral rna copy numbers was determined using a standard curve based on a cdna plasmid containing the gene fragment of  <dig> bp in 3' noncoding region of denv <dig> strain hawaii.

plaque forming assay
the titres of virus were determined by a plaque forming assay on bhk- <dig> cells and expressed as pfu per ml. briefly, virus was serially 10-fold diluted and incubated with bhk- <dig> cell monopayers for 2h at 37°c. the monolayers were then overlaid with  <dig> %  carboxymethylcellulose and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> days. the wells were stained with 1%  crystal violet dissolved in 4%  formaldehyde to visualize the plaques. plaques were counted and the virus titer was expressed as pfu/ml.

plaque reduction neutralization test 
neutralizing activity of prm-specific antibodies was determined by the plaque reduction neutralization test . briefly, 2-fold serially diluted antibody was mixed with approximately  <dig> pfu denv and incubated for 1h at 37°c. the mixtures were then transferred to bhk- <dig> cell monolayers followed by the plaque forming assay described above. the percentage of plaque reduction was calculated as previously described  <cit> .

antibody-dependent infection enhancement assay
serial 2-fold dilutions of antibody were incubated with an equal volume of denv for 1h at 37°c then transferred to k <dig> cells at moi of 1and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> days. supernatants were then harvested and viral rna levels were assessed by qrt-pcr as described above. alternatively, after  <dig> days, infected k <dig> cells were determined by flow cytometry.

flow cytometry
the infected k <dig> cells were fixed and permeabilised with cytofix/ cytoperm™ fixation/permeabilization kit  at 4°c for  <dig> min. denv antigens were then stained with 4g <dig> conjugated to alexa-fluor- <dig>  at 4°c for  <dig> min. the cells were washed twice, and percent infection was determined by flow cytometry.

RESULTS
characterization of denv-specific mab 4d10
elisa assays showed that 4d <dig>  like 2h <dig> , detected denv1- <dig> infected cells but not jev  infected cells . western blot analysis confirmed that the specificity of 4d <dig> and 2h <dig> for denv1- <dig> prm protein . to further prove the denv serotypes specificity of 4d <dig>  we also performed an indirect immunofluorescence assay . only denv infected c6/ <dig> cells were detected by 4d <dig> and 2h <dig>  jev infected cells were not reactive. these results suggested that 4d <dig> is similar to 2h <dig>  which has been proved to be a denv cross-reacting prm mab  <cit> . we concluded that 4d <dig> is a denv serocomplex cross-reactive prm mab that does not cross-react with other flaviviruses.

to confirm further the specificity reactivity of 4d <dig>  an antibody competitive- inhibition assay was carried out to determine whether the 4d <dig> competed with denv <dig> patient sera for reactivity with denv <dig>  the reaction activity of denv <dig> patient sera with denv <dig> was inhibited markedly by 4d <dig> with the inhibition percentage from 33% to 61% .

screening of phage-displayed peptide library with anti-denv prm mab 4d10
to select the immunopositive phage clones, anti-denv1- <dig> prm mab  was purified from the ascites using the protein a affinity column. the bound phage clones were selected after four biopanning rounds. fifty-five of  <dig> selected phage clones had significant enhancement of reactivity to mab 4d <dig> but not to normal mouse serum  . inserted nucleotides of the selected positive phage clones were sequenced and translated to peptide sequences . through alignment of phage-displayed peptide sequences using dnastar software, the binding motif of antibody 4d <dig> was shown to be vs/gkte . we next compared the binding motif with the primary amino acid sequence of the prm protein of denv1- <dig>  yfv, wnv, jev and tbev and found that the epitope for antibody 4d <dig> corresponded only to amino acid residues  <dig> to <dig> of denv1- <dig> prm protein but not to other flaviviruses . notably, the epitope for antibody 4d <dig> is only conserved among four denv serotypes.

notes: athe protein sequences of denv <dig>  denv <dig>  denv <dig>  denv <dig>  wnv, jev, yfv and tbev were retrieved from genbank with accession numbers eu <dig>  af <dig>  m <dig>  ay <dig>  dq <dig>  af <dig>  x <dig> and ay <dig> respectively. the amino acids identical between the binding motif and prm protein are shown in bold.

general evaluation of denv prm epitopes with bioinformation software
in order to select the predominant epitopes of denv prm, we performed general evaluation of denv prm protein sequence including hopp & wood hydrophilicity; granthan polarity; jameson & wolf antigenicity; bhaskaran & ponnuswamy flexibility; emini accessibility; deleage & roux alpha-helix regions and beta-turn regions. the epitopes are most likely fall on the regions that have shown in table  <dig>  according to the empirical rules that the positions of b-cell epitopes ought to be located at the region which contained more beta-turns but fewer alpha-helixes, as well as be hydrophilic, polar, antigenic, flexible, and accessible, we found that one of possible b-cell epitopes was located in amino acid residuals 12– <dig> .

notes: the possible predominant b epitope region showing conformity with the result of phage-displayed peptide library is shown in bold.

properties analysis of synthetic peptide
to verify that peptide sequence corresponding to amino acid residuals 14– <dig> of the prm protein of denv was indeed recognized by the antibody 4d <dig>  synthetic peptide pl <dig>  binding assays were carried out. as shown in figure 3a, 4d <dig> specifically reacted with the synthetic peptide pl <dig>  whereas control antibody 4g <dig>  did not reacted with pl <dig>  for the sensitivity binding assay, the synthetic peptide pl <dig> bound the antibody in a concentration-dependent manner. two control peptides ph <dig>  and pm <dig>  were not reactive .

we next evaluated whether the synthetic peptide pl <dig> could be react with anti-denv1- <dig> mice sera. synthetic peptide pl <dig> was recognized by anti-denv1- <dig> mice sera, whereas it was not recognized by anti-jev mice sera and normal mice sera  . we concluded that synthetic peptide pl <dig> is a denv serocomplex cross-reactive epitope-based peptide.

to confirm further the phage-displayed peptide was the epitope of antibody 4d <dig>  a peptide competitive-inhibition assay was performed to determine whether the pl <dig> peptide competed with corresponding phage clones for reactivity with 4d <dig>  the reaction activity of antibody 4d <dig> with the corresponding phage clones was inhibited markedly by pl <dig> at  <dig>  μg per well with the inhibition percentage from 34% to 69% . the results showed that the synthetic peptide and corresponding phage clones competed for the same antibody-binding site. together, these findings suggest that 4d <dig> recognizes a new epitope on the n-terminal segment of denv1- <dig> prm protein.

then, we evaluated the reactivity of synthetic peptide pl <dig> with denv <dig> patient serum samples. pl <dig> was able to detect  <dig> serum samples obtained from  <dig> denv <dig> patients . the sensitivity of pl <dig> serologic test was 95%. in addition, the level of antibody varied among patients. in contrast, all of the serum samples collected from  <dig> healthy adults were shown to be seronegative .

immunogenicity of synthetic peptide on balb/c mice
the antibody titer values were measured after immunization of balb/c mice with pl <dig> coupled to klh, ph <dig> coupled to klh, pm <dig> coupled to klh or pbs. sera of preimmunization group were tested at 1: <dig> dilution to yield the values of background. the antibody titer of sera from mice immunized with pl <dig> was remarkably higher than that of the sera from mice immunized with ph <dig>  pm <dig> and pbs . and there was a significant increase of antibody titer of pl <dig> after the second boost immunization .

protection response in adult balb/c mice
two weeks after the last immunization, groups of mice were infected with denv <dig> ngc strain . the viral rna copy numbers of sera were quantified by qrt-pcr . we detected high levels of viral rna in all groups at day  <dig>  and  <dig> post-infection, but the viral rna copies were significantly reduced in all the groups at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-infection. in spite of that, the vial rna levers in the pl <dig> group were remarkably higher than that in groups of ph <dig>  pm <dig> and pbs at day  <dig>  and  <dig> post-infection .

infectious properties of standard denv <dig> and imdenv2
the growth and specific infectivity of the viruses were measured by qrt-pcr and plaque forming assay respectively. as shown in figure 6a, we determined the viral rna copies by qrt-pcr and found that lovo and c6/ <dig> cells released comparable viral rna copies at each time point examined. this indicates that the capacity of releasing viral particles is not impaired in furin-deficient lovo cells. in both cell lines, we detected maximal virus particles released at  <dig> hpi. next, we determined the infectious properties of the distinct virus preparations by plaque forming assay. the infectious titer of imdenv <dig> was severely reduced than that of virus produced in the c6/ <dig> cells at any given time point . subsequently, we calculated the ratio of viral rna copies  to infectious titer  for each of the virus samples . the virus-equivalent particles per pfu of lovo cells was remarkably higher than that of c6/ <dig> cells. these results showed that the specific infectivity of imdenv was at least  <dig>  000-fold lower compared with that of virus produced in c6/ <dig> cells.

plaque reduction neutralization test
neutralizing activities of mab 4d <dig> and anti-pl <dig> sera for standard denv1- <dig> and imdenv <dig> were assessed using a standard plaque reduction neutralization assay. we found that 4d <dig> and anti-pl <dig> sera were unable to completely neutralize infection . instead, neutralization level ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, and the partial neutralization was cross-reactive among the four virus serotypes. these antibodies did not exhibit a high level of neutralization. although infectivity of imdenv <dig> was severely reduced, it remained partially susceptible to neutralization and the titration curve for denv <dig> produced in lovo and c6/ <dig> cells were similar .these results indicate that mab 4d <dig> and anti-pl <dig> sera could not potently neutralize standard denv1- <dig> and imdenv <dig> 

ade of denv infection mediated by 4d <dig> and anti-pl <dig> sera
we carried out ade assays with fc receptor-bearing k <dig> cells to determine the enhancing capacity of 4d <dig>  anti-pl <dig> sera and 4g <dig>  towards standard denv1- <dig> and imdenv <dig> using flow cytometry and qrt-pcr. previous studies have shown that 4g <dig> was capable of enhancing infection of standard denv1- <dig> and imdenv <dig>  <cit> . consistent with these reports, enhancement of infection was observed for 4g <dig> in this study . according to flow cytometry results, enhancement of infection was observed for 4d <dig> and anti-pl <dig> sera with a peak of nearly 80% increase , the enhanced infection percentage varied from  <dig> % to  <dig> % over a large range of antibody concentration among four denv serotypes. next we tested enhancement of imdenv <dig> using a constant amount of virus-equivalent particles compared to denv <dig>  the results showed that the normally non-infectious imdenv <dig> could be rendered much more infectious in the presence of 4d <dig> and anti-pl <dig> sera than denv <dig> did . these results were further exemplified by assessing viral rna copies in infected supernatants using qrt-pcr . consistent with flow cytometry results, 4d <dig> and anti-pl <dig> sera led to a significant increase of viral load over a broad antibody concentration range . taken together, both 4d <dig> and anti-pl <dig> sera could potently enhance infection of standard denv and imdenv <dig> 

discussion
it has been previously reported that anti-prm mabs provided cross-protection against all four denv serotypes  <cit> . however, the potential importance of these prm-containing particles and prm antibodies in denv infection pathogenesis has been ignored for a long time as numerous functional studies have reported that fully immature particles are noninfectious  <cit> . interestingly, recent studies on human and mouse anti-prm mabs  <cit>  suggest that prm-specific mabs have a significant role to enhance infection of standard denv and imdenv particles. however, there have been few attempts to locate the epitopes of prm ptotein. to gain a deeper understanding of the antigenic structures of prm and their functions in human immune response to denv, we identified the epitope of prm mab 4d <dig> and investigated the ability of mab 4d <dig> and antibody against epitope peptide pl <dig> to mediate ade infection of standard denv1- <dig> and imdenv particles.

in this study, we generated and characterized a denv serocomplex cross-reactive prm mab 4d <dig>  then, we successfully mapped the epitope of 4d <dig> to amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig> of denv1- <dig> prm protein using phage display technology. the epitope peptide showed conformity with one region  predicted by bioinformatics analysis. consequently, the epitope peptide  was synthesized for further study. we confirmed that pl <dig> was a denv serocomplex cross-reactive epitope peptide and showed to be highly immunogenic in balb/c mice. also, pl <dig> could successfully distinguish denv serotypes from other flaviviruses in immunized mice sera. the high degree of antibody cross-reactivity among different flaviviruses has been a diagnostic challenge to distinguish various flaviviral infections, and this limitation is apparent for members of denv serotypes  <cit> . it has been previously reported that prm-specific antibodies could be applied as a diagnostic marker to distinguish previous infection of denv from jev  <cit> . thus, it is remarkable that the denv-specific epitope in prm has great potential to improve denv serological diagnostic tests. furthermore, pl <dig> could successfully recat with denv2-infected patient sera but not with sera of healthy donors, suggesting that the epitope peptide pl <dig> could possibly be used as a serologic reagent in the diagnosis of denv-infected patients.

the control peptide ph <dig>  may be the possible epitope region of prm protein predicted by bioinformatics analysis, but the antibody titer of ph <dig> was not high enough. for synthetic peptides to serve as effective immunogens, they must comprise potential antigenic sites to promote b cell interaction  <cit> .

immature particles produced in furin-deficient lovo cells have very high levels  of prm-containing particles. interestingly, both mammalian cells  and insect cells  infected with denv release as many as 30% prm- containing immature particles  <cit>  suggesting that cleavage of prm to m is not very effective. therefore, cells infected with denv release a heterogeneous mixture of not only fully mature and immature  but also partially mature virus particles   <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that mature particles and partially mature particles were infectious whereas immature particles were virtually non-infectious  <cit> . the maturation state of virus particles can influence the neutralizing and enhancing capacity of antibodies direct against denv surface proteins  <cit> . we detected the specific infectivity of the lovo-released virus particles and found that the infectious properties of imdenv <dig> was  <dig> -fold lower compared to that of c6/36-cultured standard virus preparations. this agrees with previous results  <cit>  and proves that immature virus is virtually non-infectious.

antibodies induced by denv infection may have dual roles: obstruct infection through neutralization activity or enhance viral infection via ade activity. consistent with prior studies  <cit> , the mab 4d <dig> and antibody against epitope peptide pl <dig> described in the present study showed broad cross-reactivity and poor neutralizing activity with the four standard denv serotypes and imdenv but significantly enhanced the infectious properties. these results suggested 4d <dig> and anti-pl <dig> sera were infection-enhancing antibodies and pl <dig> was infection-enhancing epitope. we found mab 4d <dig> and antibody against pl <dig> showed different neutralizing against different virus strains, suggesting the existence of structural differences in the epitope region. the mechanism of virus neutralization and ade in the presence of antibody against prm is still elusive. consistent with these results, during protection assay in vivo, our data clearly suggested the epitope peptide pl <dig> indeed elicit enhancing antibodies and promote denv replication. the partial neutralization of antibodies against prm to standard dengue viruses implies that some infectious particles within the virus preparation are partially mature  and also indicates that prm antibodies have the capacity to block the infectivity of partially mature particles. meanwhile, partial cleavage of prm from the viral surface reduces available antigens for neutralization activity. the cross-reactive among four denv serotypes, together with partial cleavage of prm, makes dengue viruses susceptible to ade by antibody against prm  <cit> . it was recently shown that anti-prm antibodies could render essentially non-infectious imdenv particles highly infectious. the prm antibodies bind to the virion surface prm antigens and facilitate efficient binding and cell entry of virus-antibody complexes into fc receptor-bearing cells following which the endosomal furin clears prm into m and renders immature particles infectious  <cit> . taken together, our results support the notion that antibodies against prm can enhance infectivity of prm-containing immature and partially mature denv particles due to an interaction with fc receptor expressed on immune cells.

as shown in figure 8a and b, at low dilution of antibody, enhancing and neutralizing activities are mixed and enhancement is suboptimal, so little or no infection enhancement is found. then, enhanced viral growth occurs at a higher dilution. at some dilution of antibody, optimal viral infections occur and peak enhancement is observed. at a still higher dilution, the concentration of infectious antibody–virus complexes is not great enough to elicit the system response and the infection enhancement is gradually lost  <cit> . the peak infection enhancement also need a large number of virus receptors on fcr-bearing cells, the efficient cell entry of virus, the viability of virus in the cytosol, and capability to accomplish all steps to achieve assembly and final release of virus particles.

since recent studies found that denv particles released from infected cells contained as many as 30% prm particles, the infectious potential of immature particles may have significant implications for understanding of the dengue pathogenesis. in the early stages of a primary infection, immature particles fail to enter host cells in the absence of antibodies, and therefore are of minor importance in disease development. on the other hand, prm-specific antibody response will activate the infectivity of fully immature particle upon secondary infection, and increase the number of infectious particles.

the epitope recognized by our own anti-prm antibody was located in amino acid residuals 14– <dig> of the prm protein and was different from the published sequence recognized by other anti-prm mab 2h <dig>  and 70- <dig>   <cit> . previous studies have shown that 2h <dig> provided cross-protection against all four denv serotypes  <cit> . however, many studies demonstrated that 2h <dig> could enhance the infectivity of standard denvv and imdenv  <cit> . also, antibody 70– <dig> as well as many other prm mabs has been reported to enhance denv infectivity  <cit> . our results support that anti-prm antibodies could enhance infectious properties of denv and prm epitopes could be not protective but infection enhancing. we propose that the length of epitope sequence has an important role to mediate ade infection. for long epitope peptide sequences, they may contain two or more epitopes, which may be immunodominant or cryptic. these findings suggest that antigenic structures of prm and their functions are complicated and not well studied.

most current dengue vaccines contain native dengue prm, it may be important to consider better vaccine approaches that eliminate ade activities induced by infection-enhancing epitopes on prm during vaccine design  <cit> . vaccine candidates that eliminate pathogenic infection-enhancing epitopes may thus become increasingly important. most importantly, identification of the epitopes on prm protein will provide new insights for further understanding of humoral immune responses to denv at the epitope level. however, to our knowledge, there have been few reports of epitopes mapping to aim at prm protein. here, we report a novel infection-enhancing epitope on dengue prm, the findings from our study may have significant implications for future vaccine design and facilitate understanding the pathogenesis of denv infection.

CONCLUSIONS
we mapped the epitope of 4d <dig> to amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig> of denv1- <dig> prm using a phage-displayed peptide library and comprehensive bioinformatic analysis. then, we found that this epitope was infection-enhancing. these findings may provide important information for the understanding of the pathogenesis of denv infection at epitope level and contribute to the development of dengue vaccine.
