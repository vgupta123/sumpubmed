BACKGROUND
ribosomal protein dysfunction causes abnormal ribosomal particle assembly and affects protein synthesis in all cell types. although rp dysfunction affects multiple tissues and systems, pathological defects in hematopoietic systems, such as aberrant development in diamond–blackfan anemia , are the most frequently observed phenotypes  <cit> .

mutations in rp genes reduce the efficiency of ribosome biogenesis, which is indispensable for immature erythrocytes in early and rapid growth phases  <cit> . defective ribosome biosynthesis leads to excessive release of rps such as rpl <dig> and rpl <dig>  which may increase p <dig> activity by activating the rps mdm2-p <dig> signaling pathway  <cit> . because erythroid progenitor cells are highly sensitive to p <dig> activation  <cit> , subsequent activation of the p <dig> pathway in erythroid progenitor cells leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and finally to hematopoietic disorders. interestingly, these hematopoietic defects were rescued by increased rp expression or reduced p <dig> activity in zebrafish and in erythroid progenitor cells from dba patients  <cit> . it was also observed that rpl22l <dig> plays essential roles in hematopoiesis, but acts independently of p <dig> and does not induce apoptosis  <cit> .

dba is a rare congenital red blood cell dysplasia that develops soon after birth. this disorder is mainly characterized by reduced reticulocyte counts, selective red cell aplasia, and macrocytosis, while a number of other blood cell lineages, such as neutrophils and platelets, are maintained or slightly decreased. furthermore, dba patients suffer other developmental defects, such as short stature, cleft lip, hand deformities, kidney and heart hypoplasia, and tumor predisposition  <cit> . ribosome biogenesis defects have been identified as a major cause of dba, and mutations of genes encoding rps have emerged as the main cause of dba. indeed, various mutations have been found in coding and noncoding regions of at least  <dig> rps, including rpl <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rps27a, and rpl35a, accounting for about 55% of all dba cases  <cit> . rps <dig> was the first identified causative gene in dba patients, and its mutations account for 25% of dba cases  <cit> .

rpl <dig> is one of  <dig> vertebrate rps, and its gene mutations occur on coding and intronic binding regions of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . dba patients with mutations in rpl <dig> show typical hematopoietic defects, and 67% of these have physical deformities, especially of the thumb  <cit> . in particular, rpl <dig> dysfunction results in abnormal erythrocyte development, markedly decreased progenitor cell proliferation, delayed erythroid differentiation, and markedly increased apoptosis  <cit> . importantly, these are different from the deficiencies in dba patients with rps <dig> mutations  <cit> . hence, divergent mechanisms underlie hematopoietic defects in dba patients with different rp mutations. moreover, rpl <dig> dysfunction in erythroblasts lead to aberrant erythroblast differentiation, reduced hemoglobin, and unusual cell morphology  <cit> .

zebrafish are a classic animal model for mechanistic studies of embryonic development, hematopoiesis, and dba  <cit> . knockdown of most rp genes causes developmental defects in the brain of zebrafish, indicating that the vast majority of rp functions are associated with nervous system development  <cit> . several reports focus on regulation of zebrafish hematopoiesis by the rp proteins rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rps <dig>  and rps <dig>  <cit> . rpl <dig> dysfunction in zebrafish embryos leads to defective development, hematopoiesis, brain development, and shape dysplasia  <cit> . furthermore, danilova et al. reported that the hematopoietic defects caused by rpl <dig> dysfunction were fully reversed by the inhibition of p <dig> activity in zebrafish mutants  <cit> , indicating that p <dig> may regulate rpl <dig> in zebrafish  <cit> . however, hematopoiesis in zebrafish with dysfunctional rps <dig> is not fully recovered by inhibition of p <dig>  <cit> . presumably, these varying phenotypic defects in zebrafish embryos with dysfunctional rpl <dig> are regulated by multifactorial interactions of genes, regulatory networks, and signaling pathways.

high-throughput transcriptome sequencing is now widely accepted as a useful tool for investigating human disease mechanisms and gene functions. however, this technology has not been widely used in zebrafish research. using microarray technology, danilova et al.  studied the impact of rpl <dig> deficiency on hematopoiesis of zebrafish embryos. however, because of the limitations of detectable gene transcripts, some important aspects of rpl <dig> functions in zebrafish may only be elucidated using high-throughput sequencing.

in this study, we examined genome-wide transcription by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos. in combination with bioinformatic analyses, we studied affected genes, hematopoiesis-related signaling pathways, and molecular regulatory networks in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos. we found that rpl <dig> deficiency leads to defects of hemoglobin synthesis and hematopoiesis, which were caused by dysregulation of iron metabolism-related genes and impaired hsc differentiation and proliferation. these analyses provide new insights into the pathogenesis of mutant rpl11-mediated dba.

RESULTS
hematopoietic defects in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos
to investigate the regulation of rpl <dig> in hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos, we initially established an rpl11-deficient zebrafish model using mo knockdown technology. we observed various phenotypes in this model, including smaller brains, tail deformities, and hematopoietic defects, which were consistent with other studies  <cit> . benzidine staining of rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos at  <dig> hpf showed that globin expression was significantly decreased compared with that in control mo embryos, indicating defects of globin synthesis during late erythroid differentiation . subsequently, deep sequencing was performed to investigate the impact of rpl <dig> on the transcriptome of rpl11-deficient and control mo embryos at  <dig> hpf. the effectiveness of translational inhibition by rpl <dig> mo was confirmed by examining the green fluorescent fusion protein under a fluorescence microscope .

transcriptome changes in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos
to comprehensively reflect the impact of rpl <dig> deficiency on the transcriptome of zebrafish embryos, we collected 40– <dig> rpl11-deficient and mo control zebrafish embryos at  <dig> hpf from at least three separate experiments and constructed two mrna-seq sequencing libraries in parallel. high-throughput sequencing was performed on the hi-seq <dig> sequencing platform in parallel. the number of sequenced gene transcript reads was 35– <dig> million. sequencing data were mapped to the latest zv <dig> version of the zebrafish genome. subsequently, 15– <dig> million readable gene transcripts were mapped to the zebrafish genome with 41–45% mapping efficiency . on average, more than  <dig>  gene transcripts were mapped to known zebrafish genes, accounting for at least 70% of annotated genes. the percentage of detected unique gene transcripts was similar to that detected in previous studies  <cit> , indicating that the present sequencing represented the vast majority of zebrafish genes.

all sequenced gene transcript reads were standardized to fpkm  <cit> , and gene expression was presented . the r package degseq was used to compare transcriptomes of rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos and mo control embryos. in total, we identified  <dig> significantly differentially expressed genes ;  <dig> were downregulated and  <dig> were upregulated. we also identified degs using screening thresholds set at p-value < <dig>  and fc > <dig>  . in addition, we found  <dig> specifically expressed genes  that were only expressed in one sample . among these, four were significantly upregulated in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos, whereas expression of the other six was almost completely inhibited, indicating high dependence of gene expression on rpl <dig> 

gene ontology analysis of rpl <dig> in zebrafish embryos
to investigate the biological functions of rpl <dig> in zebrafish embryos, we performed go analyses of genes that were significantly regulated by rpl <dig> deficiency using amigo software . since ipa software does not contain the zebrafish gene annotation that must be transformed into human genes before analysis, we used the go analysis tool in the zfin database to get more detailed information of rpl <dig> functions in zebrafish. go analyses showed that upregulated genes were specifically enriched in functions associated with iron metabolism, including iron transport, intracellular iron homeostasis, and iron binding . three zebrafish genes were involved in these iron-related functions, including zgc: <dig>  zgc: <dig>  and zgc: <dig> . however, no detailed gene annotations exist in the latest version  of the zebrafish genome. interestingly, a single human mitochondrial ferritin  homolog was found for all three of these zebrafish genes, and its aberrant expression resulted in accumulation of mitochondrial iron, disruption of intracellular iron homeostasis  <cit> , and reduction in iron utilization for heme and hemoglobin synthesis  <cit> . downregulated genes were specifically enriched in functions associated with development and differentiation of the nervous system, generation of neurons and brain development, molecular metabolic regulation, developmental regulation of cells and tissues, regulation of gene transcription, regulation of rna synthesis and metabolism, and other functions . thus, go analyses demonstrated that rpl <dig> participates in the regulation of multiple biological processes in zebrafish embryos, and particularly in hematopoietic iron metabolism-associated pathways.

hematological genes affected by rpl <dig> deficiency in zebrafish embryos
to further investigate hematopoietic failures caused by rpl <dig> deficiency in zebrafish, we analyzed affected hematological genes in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos at  <dig> hpf. to provide a more detailed list of hematological genes affected by rpl <dig> deficiency, the screening criteria were set at fc > <dig>  and p-value < <dig> . in total,  <dig> differentially expressed hematological genes were identified , and description of these genes were summarized in table  <dig>  heatmap analyses showed that most  hematological genes were significantly downregulated by rpl <dig> deficiency . subsequent go analyses demonstrated that these hematological genes were specifically enriched in diverse hematopoiesis-associated biological processes, including oxidation–reduction processes, heme binding, hypoxic oxygen binding, oxygen transporter activity, iron transport, and oxygen transport . hematological genes involved in go items were summarized in .

differentially expressed hematological genes in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos were identified .

identification of hematopoiesis-associated pathways disturbed in rpl11-deficient zebrafish
key signaling pathways in mammals are highly conserved in zebrafish. to elucidate the roles of rpl <dig> in the regulation of hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos, we used ipa software to identify the signaling pathways that are most affected  by rpl <dig> deficiency. separate pathways were constructed with upregulated and downregulated genes . among the five most affected signaling pathways, we identified three hematopoiesis pathways that were upregulated, including glucocorticoid receptor signaling  <cit> , igf- <dig> signaling  <cit> , and il-17a signaling in fibroblasts  <cit> , and two hematopoiesis-related pathways that were downregulated, including wnt/β-catenin signaling  <cit>  and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling  <cit>  . among these pathways, wnt/β-catenin signaling has been characterized as essential for formation, self-renewal, and development of hematopoietic stem cells   <cit> , which are closely associated with hematopoiesis. taken together, rpl <dig> deficiency disturbed hematopoiesis-related signaling pathways in zebrafish embryos, at least partially explaining the ensuing hematopoietic failure.

identification of regulatory networks affected by rpl <dig> deficiency in zebrafish embryos
we used ipa software to determine whether molecular regulatory networks were disturbed by rpl <dig> deficiency in zebrafish embryos . analyses showed no specifically enriched hematopoiesis-associated regulatory networks of differentially regulated genes. potentially, hematopoiesis-associated networks may have been weakened by more important functions of rpl <dig> in zebrafish embryos and were therefore not detectable or were obscured by networks regulating hematopoiesis by unknown mechanisms. through these networks, rpl <dig> may play critical regulatory roles in cell development, proliferation, and apoptosis, nervous system development, embryonic development, immunological disease, and tumor pathology. we also identified central network nodes that may directly or indirectly associate with rpl <dig>  including mmp <dig>  ap <dig>  serpine <dig>  ctgf, fos, junb, socs <dig>  sox <dig>  twist <dig>  ccnd <dig>  mmp <dig>  and app.

potential mechanisms through which rpl <dig> regulates hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos
benzidine staining of rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos showed that hemoglobin biosynthesis was significantly diminished, suggesting defects in hemoglobinization and late erythroid differentiation, which are consistent with the hypochromic anemia typical of iron, heme, or globin deficit in zebrafish embryos  <cit> . focusing on the genes associated with erythrocyte iron metabolism, we found that the majority of genes involved in zebrafish iron metabolism were abnormally expressed . these included alas <dig>  cp, fth1a/b, htt, aco <dig>  slc25a <dig>  sfxn <dig>  tfa, and tfr1b, suggesting that rpl <dig> deficiency in zebrafish might affect multiple aspects of iron metabolism that are closely regulated in highly hemoglobinized erythrocytes. for example, reduced expression of tfa and tfr1b transcripts indicates damaged iron acquisition by erythrocytes and that of slc25a <dig> and alas <dig> indicates aberrant iron utilization by erythrocytes . moreover, upregulation of three homologs of human ftmt in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos, including zgc: <dig>  zgc: <dig>  and zgc: <dig> , could lead to imbalances in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial iron metabolism in erythrocytes  <cit> . at present, it is widely reported that dysfunction of these genes in animal models leads to hematopoiesis-associated diseases such as siderocytic and microcytic anemia . taken together, aberrant expression of these genes may seriously damage iron metabolism, iron supply for heme biosynthesis, and hemoglobin biosynthesis during late erythroid differentiation, finally resulting in defective hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryo.

the arrow up and down respectively stand for up- and down-regulation of genes in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos.

hscs are capable of self-renewal and have the potential to differentiate into all blood cell lineages, including erythrocytes. runt-related transcription factor  <dig>  was previously shown to be necessary for formation of hscs. however, mrna expression of runx <dig> was too low  to represent its actual expression in zebrafish embryos using rna-seq data. thus, we assessed the proliferation and differentiation of hscs in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos by observing the expression of the hsc marker cmyb. as shown in figure 3b and additional file 13: table s <dig>  we observed a marked decrease in the mrna expression of cmyb, indicating reduction in hscs in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos. in addition, we observed dramatic reductions in mrna expression of hsc transcription factors, including hoxb4a, which regulates hsc expansion  <cit> , and tal <dig>  which controls differentiation and development of hscs  <cit> . given occasional dysplasia of blood cell lineages other than erythrocytes in dba patients, we determined whether rpl <dig> deficiency affected the development and proliferation of granulocytes, lymphocytes, and myelocytes by observing the cellular markers ikzf <dig>  spi <dig>  and mpx, respectively. qpcr analyses showed no changes in expression of these markers in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos , suggesting that development and proliferation of lymphocytes, myelocytes, and granulocytes were unaffected by rpl <dig> deficiency. taken together, hematopoietic failure in rpl11-deficient zebrafish may be attributed to defective erythropoiesis in zebrafish embryo hscs.

discussion
p <dig> pathway acts independently of rpl11-deficiency in zebrafish embryos
in previous studies, hematopoiesis was sensitive to p <dig> activation  <cit> , and p <dig> pathway was shown to be activated in dba patients  <cit>  and in rp-deficient zebrafish with defective hematopoiesis  <cit> . however, we did not observe upregulation of p <dig> signaling in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos. potentially slight changes in expression of p53-related genes were obscured by more marked transcriptional consequences of rpl <dig> deficiency in zebrafish embryos. however, these observations are consistent with rpl11-independent activation of the p <dig> pathway in dba patients  <cit> . in addition, p <dig> expression was decreased in tumor cells with dysfunctional rps  <cit> , suggesting that p <dig> expression may be sensitive to tumor and tissue environments. consistent with cells of dba patients, we speculate that cells of rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos may carry characteristics of tumor cells  <cit> .

it remains unclear whether the entire hematopoietic defective phenotype of dba is associated with increased expression of p <dig> or p53-independent mechanisms  <cit> . indeed, in a recent report, dysfunctional rpl <dig> and rpl22l <dig> led to blockage of hsc emergence. although rpl22l <dig> plays essential roles in hematopoiesis, it did not induce apoptosis and acted independently of p <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we tested the effects of p <dig> on phenotypes of rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos by observing changes in the expression of the hsc formation marker cmyb in rpl <dig> morphants and rpl <dig> and p <dig> in double morphants at  <dig> hpf. in these experiments, decreased cmyb expression was not significantly rescued by p <dig> mo at the base of the rpl <dig> mo construct . in addition, we also tested the effects of p <dig> on defective hematopoietic phenotypes of rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos by performing hemoglobin staining of embryos injected with rpl <dig> mo and rps <dig> mo, both individually and with coinjections of p <dig> mo. o-staining showed a significant reduction in the number of hemoglobin stained blood cells in individual rpl <dig> or rps <dig> knockdowns. the rps <dig> mo phenotype was partially rescued by coinjection with p <dig> mo, whereas the rpl <dig> mo phenotype was not . taken together, these results demonstrated that rpl <dig> leads to hematopoietic defects in zebrafish embryos through p53-independent pathways.

hemoglobin genes’ translation could be inhibited in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos
we observed markedly reduced hemoglobin expression in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos and analyzed globin expression using rt-pcr analysis data . in total, we identified six globin transcripts hbaa <dig>  hbae <dig>  hbae <dig>  hbbe <dig>  hbbe <dig>  and hbbe <dig> in zebrafish embryos at  <dig> hpf in rna-seq data. among these, hbae <dig>  hbae <dig>  hbbe <dig>  and hbbe <dig> are specifically expressed in embryos, while hbbe <dig> and hbaa <dig> are specifically expressed in larvae and adults, respectively  <cit> . quantitative pcr analyses demonstrated decreased hbaa <dig> and hbbe <dig> expression, but increased hbae <dig>  hbae <dig>  hbbe <dig>  and hbbe <dig> expression to varying degrees . given the reduced availability of heme and iron in rpl11-deficient zebrafish, we deduced that translation of globins might depend on the availability of heme  <cit> . because rpl <dig> deficiency specifically impairs the translation of erythroid genes in murine and human erythroblasts  <cit> , we hypothesized that rpl <dig> may specifically inhibit erythroid-specific globin translation in zebrafish embryos.

dysfunction of iron- and heme-metabolism related genes in rpl11-deficient zebrafish
erythrocyte hemoglobinization involves upregulation and close integration of the heme synthesis and iron supply pathways during hematopoiesis. in rpl11-deficient zebrafish, the vast majority of iron and heme metabolism-related genes were downregulated, contributing significantly to defective hemoglobinization and hematopoiesis. hematopoiesis requires large amounts of iron. in serum, most iron is bound to transferrin , which directs iron to hemoglobin via transferrin receptor -mediated endocytosis  <cit> . tfr <dig>  is highly expressed in erythrocytes and is directly associated with hemoglobin synthesis and erythroid progenitor maturation  <cit> . on binding, the fe–transferrin–tfr <dig> complex is rapidly internalized, and iron atoms are released and directed to the mitochondria for heme synthesis  <cit> . the mitochondrial iron transporter slc25a <dig>  is also highly expressed in erythrocytes, and its activity has been shown to be rate limiting for heme synthesis in erythrocytes  <cit> . moreover, deficiency of the drosophila homolog mfrn causes a 90% decrease in heme synthesis, and knockout of slc25a <dig> in mice leads to embryonic lethality with profound anemia  <cit> . zebrafish with the mutant slc25a <dig> show severe hypochromic anemia due to defective mitochondrial iron uptake  <cit> . alas <dig> is an erythroid-specific rate-limiting enzyme responsible for synthesis of protoporphyrin ix, which is transported out of the mitochondria and installed in globin chains for hemoglobin biosynthesis  <cit> . indeed, mutations of alas <dig> in mice caused sideroblastic anemia  <cit> . finally, ftmt was not expressed in normal erythroblasts but was highly expressed in patients with sideroblastic anemia  <cit> . upregulation of ftmt results in accumulation of mitochondrial iron followed by disruption of intracellular iron homeostasis  <cit> . moreover, overexpression of ftmt limits the availability of iron for heme synthesis and impairs mitochondrial iron metabolism  <cit> . we also observed increased expression of the putative zebrafish ftmt homologs zgc: <dig>  zgc: <dig>  and zgc: <dig> in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos, further indicating hematopoiesis-associated disease exists in rpl11-deficient zebrafish. taken together, these observations suggest that rpl <dig> participates in zebrafish hematopoiesis as a regulator of iron and heme metabolism.

rpl11-deficient zebrafish could serve as a human dba model
rpl <dig> gene mutation leads to disease phenotypes of human dba, including hematopoietic defects and physical deformities  <cit> . in zebrafish, rpl <dig> deficiency leads to hematopoietic and metabolic defects  <cit>  as well as brain developmental abnormalities  <cit> . zebrafish with dysfunctional rps have been regarded as suitable animal models for dba studies  <cit> . using the rpl11-deficient zebrafish model and transcriptome deep sequencing, we have added crucial details to the understanding of the biological functions of rpl <dig> in zebrafish and have elucidated potential mechanisms by which rpl <dig> regulates hematopoiesis. future studies will determine which pathways and regulatory mechanisms are common to both human dbas and this zebrafish model. zebrafish may serve as model systems for human diseases, and hence, our findings provide an important resource and shed new insights for the study of human dba diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we established an rpl11-deficient zebrafish model that showed defective hemoglobinization and hematopoiesis. to elucidate the mechanisms of hematopoietic failure, we performed mrna transcriptome deep sequencing of rpl11-deficient and control mo zebrafish embryos and systematically characterized rpl11-mediated disturbances in hematological gene expression, hematopoiesis-related signaling pathways, and regulatory networks in zebrafish. we also elucidated potential mechanisms by which rpl <dig> regulates hematopoiesis through genes associated with iron metabolism and proliferation and development of hscs in zebrafish embryos or through hematopoiesis-associated pathways with unknown mechanisms . the present data provide new insights into the pathogenesis of rpl11-mediated dba.
