BACKGROUND
body coloration is an ecologically important trait that is often involved in prey-predator interactions through mimicry and crypsis   <cit> . because butterflies and moths spend most of their lives as larvae, which have soft bodies, they have developed a wide range of mechanisms to protect themselves from predators such as birds. the larval body markings of butterflies differ completely between closely related species and between individuals of the same species in different life stages  <cit> . despite the variety and significance of the larval color patterns, few studies have been conducted at a molecular level compared with the available research on adult butterfly wing patterns  <cit> .

spectacular changes in color pattern are observed in the caterpillar of the swallowtail butterfly papilio xuthus. as a young larva, it mimics bird droppings , and during the final molting period, it switches to a green camouflage coloration . in addition, larvae in the final instar stage have a large eyespot on their thoracic segment that is believed to be useful for avoiding predation. one of the main factors involved in larval pattern formation is insect hormones. previously, we revealed that larval pattern switch is regulated by juvenile hormone   <cit> . the decline of jh titers on the first day of the fourth instar stage was the important factor controlling the formation of a green cryptic pattern in the fifth instar stage. the pattern transition occurs through ecdysis, and ecdysteroids appear to regulate the expression of several pigmentation genes. topical application of 20-hydroxyecdysone alters the expression timing of several pigmentation genes  <cit> . comparing gene expression between stages and markings represents a promising strategy for identifying the genes responsible for larval pattern formation.

previously, we found several pigmentation genes using a cdna subtraction and candidate gene approach  <cit> . six melanin synthesis  genes, tyrosine hydroxylase , dopa decarboxylase , yellow, tan, laccase <dig> and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase i  are highly expressed in the presumptive black regions and ebony is highly expressed in the presumptive red region  <cit> . we also reported that the combination of bilin-binding protein  <dig>  and yellow-related gene  correlated perfectly with larval blue, yellow, and green coloration in three papilio species  <cit> . however, it was difficult to obtain novel marking-specific genes expressed at particular stages or genes with relatively low expression. for butterfly adult wing patterns, expressed sequence tag  construction  <cit>  and microarray analysis  <cit>  have been conducted to obtain marking-associated genes. microarray analysis revealed that the expression of both a patterning gene  and effector gene  are associated with red wing patterns in heliconius species  <cit> .

in this study, we constructed an est library of larval epidermis with more than  <dig>  clones, and designed a microarray with the aim of comprehensively revealing the molecular mechanisms of larval mimetic and cryptic pattern formation. we performed microarray-based screening for marking-specific genes using six markings at  <dig> different stages, and verified the marking specificity of candidate genes by whole-mount in situ hybridization. we identified many novel marking-specific genes, including novel blue and yellow pigment-binding protein genes; a novel yellow family gene, the expression of which prefigures black cuticular markings; cuticular protein genes associated with marking-specific cuticular nanostructures; marking-associated regulatory genes; marking-specific ecdysteroid synthesis pathway genes; and papilio-specific marking-associated genes. the data presented in this study provide a new resource to understand insect mimetic and cryptic pattern formation.

RESULTS
construction of a papilio expressed sequence tag database
to comprehensively search the genes involved in larval body pattern formation, we constructed cdna libraries derived from the whole epidermis during the third and the fourth molting periods, and sequenced  <dig>  clones of p. xuthus and  <dig>  clones of p. polytes . we classified  <dig>  and  <dig>  nonredundant est clusters and singletons from p. xuthus and p. polytes, respectively . from these,  <dig> and  <dig> clusters were considered isoforms or premature forms of other clusters . excluding these clusters, we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  putative gene clusters  for p. xuthus and p. polytes, respectively . we assigned a serial number to each cluster in descending order of clone numbers . we also determined full-length cdna sequences for the  <dig> most highly expressed genes of p. xuthus through random amplification of cdna ends technique. among  <dig>  gene clusters of p. xuthus,  <dig>  genes had orfs encoding predicted proteins longer than  <dig> amino acids, of which  <dig>  had significant sequence similarities to monarch butterfly danaus plexippus proteins  <cit> ,  <dig>  to silkworm bombyx mori proteins  <cit> , and  <dig>  to fruit fly drosophila melanogaster proteins  . based on the signalp  <dig>  program  <cit> , we identified  <dig> genes encoding putative signal peptides .

areported in  <cit> ; b <dig> clusters of p. xuthus,  <dig> clusters of p. polytes, and  <dig> clusters of b. mori were considered to be isoforms/premature forms of other clusters. est: expressed sequence tags.

comparison of highly expressed genes among two papilio species and bombyx
we previously reported a full-length est database of larval epidermis in the fourth molting period of the silkworm b. mori  <cit> . because p. xuthus and p. polytes larvae have a completely different appearance from b. mori larvae, there is a possibility that the combination of highly expressed genes may be different between papilio and bombyx. we color-coded the  <dig> most highly expressed genes in accordance with the similarity of the abundance of est clones . the  <dig> most highly expressed genes of p. xuthus and p. polytes included many cuticular protein family genes, similar to b. mori. while the details of the  <dig> most highly expressed genes of p. xuthus were very similar to those of p. polytes , the combination of highly expressed genes were different from those of b. mori , which may reflect the differences of the larval appearance between papilio and bombyx. for example, three genes, px- <dig> , px- <dig>  and px- <dig> , were included among the  <dig> most highly expressed genes in both p. xuthus and p. polytes , but homologs of these genes were not found in the b. mori epidermal est database. several cuticular protein genes were only found in b. mori, and many cuticular protein genes ranking high in papilio species were not among the  <dig> most highly expressed genes in b. mori . although the accuracy of expression levels was unclear based only on the clone numbers of the est database, the relatively high expression of the  <dig> most highly expressed genes of p. xuthus was subsequently confirmed by microarray analysis. notably, px- <dig> and px- <dig> had sequence similarity with bilin-binding protein , and px- <dig> had sequence similarity with takeout/jh-binding protein , which we will discuss in detail in subsequent sections.

microarray-based screening for marking-specific genes in p. xuthus
one advantage of the papilio larva is its sufficiently large size for separating each marking by dissection, that is, these larvae are convenient for performing microarray analysis of the markings. in addition to the est dataset, to construct the papilio microarray we also independently cloned  <dig> genes known to be associated with wing-marking patterns or ecdysteroid signal cascade   <cit>  by using degenerate primers . we used  <dig> samples in the microarray .

to determine whether we could compare microarray data across all samples, we first compared the normalized signal intensity of housekeeping genes . we found that these genes were ubiquitously expressed as expected, and their normalized signal intensity among the samples was within two-fold of their average values in most cases . we also checked several melanin synthesis genes, for which we have previously reported their stage-specific and marking-specific expressions, and confirmed the expected specific expression . thus, we considered that a comparison of the normalized signal intensity across all of the examined samples is reliable for screening of the novel marking- and stage-specific genes.

to screen for marking-specific genes, we compared the average normalized signal intensities between mimetic white  and mimetic black  samples, and between cryptic green   and cryptic black  samples . we categorized genes with an average signal intensity more than two-fold change between mb and mw, and/or cg and cb, and an average signal intensity higher than  <dig>  as marking-specific genes. using these criteria, we regarded  <dig> genes as mb-,  <dig> as mw-,  <dig> as cb- and  <dig> as cg-enriched genes . among the marking-specific genes, nine genes  were regarded as both mb- and cg-enriched genes. this group contained melanin synthesis and associated genes, the takeout/jhbp gene family, cuticular protein genes, the 3-dehydroecdysone 3b-reductase  gene and genes of unknown function. in contrast, three genes  were regarded as both mw- and cg-enriched genes. px- <dig> was a papilio-specific highly expressed gene based on a comparison of the  <dig> most highly expressed genes . one gene, px- <dig>  already reported as bbp <dig>  was regarded as mb- and cg-enriched gene. this is reasonable because bbp <dig> expression was detected in blue spots within the black region of the mimetic pattern and the green region of the cryptic pattern  <cit> .

to screen for instar- and stage-specific genes, expression profiles were grouped by self-organizing maps with genepattern software  <cit> , which is often used to summarize microarray data. by self-organizing maps analysis, expression profiles were grouped into  <dig> co-expression clusters . the largest cluster  contained approximately one third of the genes with constant expression profiles . other clusters contained intermolt-enriched genes  and genes enriched in the early , middle , and late stages of molting . genes belonging to clusters other than cluster c were expected to be regulated by ecdysteroid because their expression levels differed in the molting period when the ecdysteroid titer changes . the third instar-  and fourth instar-enriched genes  were expected to be positively and negatively regulated by jh, respectively. the genes with similar expression patterns between the third and fourth instars  were assumed to be jh-independent genes. the marking specificity and instar and/or stage specificity for each gene is indicated in additional file  <dig> 

identification of several candidates for blue and yellow pigment-binding proteins
one of the most obvious characteristics of the papilio larval cryptic pattern is the overall green coloration. lepidopteran larval green coloration consists of blue bile pigment  and yellow carotenoids in general  <cit> . these pigments usually exist as pigment-protein complexes in vivo  <cit> . we previously reported that the combination of bbp <dig> and yrg correlated perfectly with larval blue, yellow and green coloration in three papilio species  <cit> . although the high expression of bbp <dig>  in the cg region was indicated by the est database, microarray analyses and whole-mount in situ hybridization , yrg  expression was relatively low . this imbalance in the expression level of putative blue and yellow pigment-binding proteins suggested the presence of other pigment-binding proteins. no gene homologous to the carotenoid-binding protein reported from the silkworm b. mori  <cit>  was found in the papilio est datasets. instead, px- <dig>  and px- <dig> , both among the  <dig> most highly expressed genes in the est library, appeared to be good candidates for carotenoid-binding protein and bbp genes . both px- <dig> and px- <dig> were cg-enriched in the microarray-based gene expression analysis . the expression profile of px- <dig> was very similar to that of bbp <dig>  . molecular phylogeny indicated that px- <dig> and its p. polytes ortholog pp <dig> were members of the lipocalin family, a putative binding protein for lipophilic substances, including the bbp of pieris rapae and insecticyanin  of manduca sexta . thus, we named px- <dig> , bbp <dig>  molecular phylogeny also indicated that these genes had lineage-specific gene duplication, and p. xuthus and p. polytes had at least four and five paralogous genes, respectively. almost identical marking-specific expression between bbp <dig> and bbp <dig> in both p. xuthus and p. polytes was indicated by microarray analysis and whole-mount in situ hybridization , suggesting that these two genes may function coordinately as blue pigment-binding proteins. as it is supposed that bbps of the saturniid silkworm rhodinia fugax exist as a dimer in epidermis  <cit> , it is possible that bbp <dig> and bbp <dig> form heterodimers. notably, bombyrin of b. mori is not associated with blue coloration, and molecular phylogeny indicated that the blue pigment-binding proteins of pieris, manduca and papilio do not form a single cluster, suggesting that blue pigment-binding proteins evolved independently to serve a common physiological role in each organism.

regarding px- <dig>  its spatial expression pattern associated with the cryptic pattern was similar to those of bbp <dig> and bbp <dig> in p. xuthus . similar to the expression pattern of yrg reported previously  <cit> , the expression of pp- <dig>  in p. polytes was not detected in the blue spot region  whereas bbp <dig> and bbp <dig> expression was clearly detected . molecular phylogeny indicated that px- <dig> formed a large cluster consisting of the takeout/jhbp gene family and  <dig> other genes in the p. xuthus est database . notably, this cluster included the carotenoid-binding protein of the locust schistocerca gregaria   <cit> , suggesting that px- <dig> is one of the p. xuthus carotenoid-binding proteins. px- <dig> formed a papilio-specific cluster with three other papilio genes . among the  <dig> papilio takeout/jhbp genes, px- <dig> and its closest homolog gene px- <dig> had the strongest marking specificity in the microarray expression profile . in contrast to that of px- <dig>  the expression level of px- <dig> was higher in eye spot regions and v-shaped markings . consistent with the microarray results, the spatial expression pattern of px- <dig> perfectly correlated with the yellow spot region of the v-shaped markings . the expression patterns of px- <dig> and px- <dig> strongly suggest that these papilio-specific family genes bind yellow carotenoid pigments with different spatial regulation. we therefore named these genes putative carotenoid-binding proteins . moderate pcbp <dig>  expression was also detected in the white region of the mimetic pattern by microarray analysis and in situ hybridization, suggesting that this gene also colocalizes with white pteridine/uric acid pigments .

because jhbp has high ligand specificity  <cit>  and it has been assumed to be monomeric in solution  <cit> , pcbp <dig> and pcbp <dig> may bind to different types of carotenoids. other takeout/jhbp genes  also had marking specificity and were enriched in the fourth instar , suggesting that these genes also have a supporting role in carotenoid binding. because the presence of several carotenoids, including alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lutein, have been reported for p. xuthus  <cit> , these takeout/jhbp family genes of p. xuthus may each recognize a different carotenoid.

notably, the locust carotenoid-binding protein  did not form a single cluster with px- <dig> or px- <dig>  which is similar to the case of bbp, suggesting that both blue and yellow pigment-binding proteins evolved convergently among insect species. green coloration among lepidopteran larvae appears to have emerged independently in the phylogenetic tree  <cit> . the independent occurrence of bbps and carotenoid-binding proteins within the lipocalin family genes and takeout/jhbp family genes may reflect the convergent evolution of larval green coloration.

identification of the novel marking-specific melanin synthesis gene, yellow-h3
we previously reported that several melanin-related genes were associated with stage- and species-specific black larval cuticular markings in three papilio species  <cit> . the microarray results were consistent with our previous findings. both th  and ddc  were strongly expressed in the black markings during the latter half of the molting period; yellow  and laccase <dig>  were strongly expressed in the black markings during the middle of the molting period; tan  was strongly expressed in the cryptic black markings at the latter half of the molting period; and gtp-ch i  was strongly expressed in the black markings only in specific stages . in addition to these genes, yellow-f-related genes have been reported as dopachrome-converting enzymes for melanin biosynthesis   <cit> . in b. mori and d. melanogaster,  <dig> and  <dig> yellow family genes  have been reported   <cit> . we obtained all yellow family genes in p. xuthus  excluding yellow-b. in lepidopteran species, yellow-f <dig> and yellow-f <dig> are the closest homologs to drosophila yellow-f/yellow-f <dig>   <cit> .

unexpectedly, yellow-f <dig>  and yellow-f <dig>  of p. xuthus were not upregulated in black markings, but instead were cg-enriched . conversely, yellow-h <dig>  was upregulated in black markings, and it exhibited a very similar expression pattern to that of yellow . using whole-mount in situ hybridization, we confirmed that the spatial expression pattern of yellow-h <dig> prefigured the black markings similar to yellow . the only previous report concerning the role of yellow-h <dig> in coloration was the demonstration of its association with black regions in heliconius wings by rt-pcr, but its spatial expression patterns have not been clarified  <cit> . our data, combined with the heliconius results, suggest that yellow-h <dig> functions in melanin biosynthesis in lepidopteran species  similarly to yellow-f and yellow-f <dig> in drosophila.

based on our microarray analysis, three yellow family genes, yellow-f <dig>  yellow-h <dig> and yellow-e, were regarded as cg-enriched genes . yellow-f <dig> was highly expressed during the late molting period similar to th and ddc, and yellow-h <dig> and yellow-e were highly expressed during the middle of the molting period similar to yellow , implying that these genes may function in inhibiting melanin pigmentation. in the silkworm b. mori, yellow-e disruption promoted melanin pigmentation in the larval head and tail, where strong yellow-e expression was detected  <cit> , which is consistent with our results. in melanin synthesis, it is assumed that arylalkylamine-n-acetyltransferase  activity is involved in synthesis of n-acetyldopamine, a precursor of colorless cuticle  <cit> . however, disruption of nat in b. mori resulted in an overall blackish phenotype only in the adult stage, whereas it had little effect on larval pigmentation  <cit> . our est datasets did not contain nat or nat-like genes, suggesting that nat gene is not the primary factor for colorless cuticular production in larval stages. because green is the color of the epidermis seen through the colorless cuticle, the observation of cg-enriched yellow family genes  implies that yellow family genes are major negative regulators of melanin pigmentation in the larval stage instead of the nat gene . taxa-specific gene duplication found between drosophila and lepidopteran species , and the reverse function implicated for yellow-f family genes between diptera and lepidoptera suggest that the function of the yellow gene family has diversified among insect taxa.

marking-specific cuticular protein genes
the  <dig> most highly expressed genes of the papilio epidermal est dataset included many cuticular protein genes similar to b. mori   <cit> . in b. mori, more than  <dig> cuticular protein genes have been reported  <cit> . the heat map of  <dig> cuticular protein genes of p. xuthus indicated the clear stage specificity of most of the cuticular protein genes . cuticular protein genes can be divided into several groups based on amino acid sequence similarity  <cit> . many genes with a cpfl or rr <dig> motif were highly expressed in the third instar  although stage specificity was not completely associated with this motif, as we reported previously  <cit> . interestingly, many cuticular protein genes also displayed marking specificity , which was confirmed by in situ hybridization . the cuticular proteins cpg <dig>  and cpr <dig>  were highly expressed in the cg region as well as the yellow spot region in v-shaped markings , and cpt <dig>  was highly expressed in the yellow spot region as well as the boundary of the v-shaped region . strong expression of cpr41a  was detected in the red regions of the eyespot . to examine whether the different spatial expression of the cuticular protein genes affected exoskeletal structures, we examined the cuticular surface by electron microscopy. we found that cuticular structures were different at each marking , and we could easily recognize the eyespot region through electron microscopy . the surface nanostructure was fine in the black region of the eyespot and coarse in the yellowish green region around the eyespot. the surface nanostructure of the red region was intermediate between the black and green regions. the white stripe center of the eyespot had a very smooth surface. we previously reported that muscle was attached to this white stripe region  <cit> . the surface nanostructure dramatically changed at the boundary of the v-shaped markings . the surface nanostructure of the black stripe region was fine and the green region was coarse similar to the eyespot. these results indicated that color pattern and surface structure are tightly related, which is similar to the adult wing scale in which clear correlations between color and structure have been reported  <cit> . although the precise role of each cuticular protein remains unclear, specific cuticular proteins may have the function of transporting or maintaining the specific cuticular pigments.

candidates for marking-associated patterning genes
although several regulatory genes have been reported for butterfly adult wing pattern formation  <cit> , it is still unclear which gene controls the larval body markings. we surveyed the marking specificity of  <dig> regulatory genes such as transcription factors and signal transducers. according to microarray analysis, nine genes , optomotor blind, ultrabithorax, vein and wingless) were expressed at lower levels than measureable, and most genes had no clear marking specificity . however, we found that e region transcript mbeta  had clear marking specificity  and four other genes e75a, e75b, fringe and spalt, also exhibited higher expression in the eyespots based on the heat map . we confirmed the stronger expression of spalt in the eyespot by whole-mount in situ hybridization  although we could not detect the positive signals of the four other genes, perhaps because of the low signal intensity in the examined stage , of the molting period when cuticular apolysis is complete). notably, spalt expression coincided with the black markings of several butterfly wing patterns  <cit> . taken together, spalt appeared to be a positive regulator of melanin pigmentation in both larvae and adult butterflies.

e75a and e75b are involved in the ecdysteroid signaling cascade, and their expression is induced by ecdysteroids  <cit> . we therefore examined the effect of ecdysteroids by the topical application method  <cit>  and found that higher e <dig> expression is maintained in black eyespot regions . the expression pattern of e <dig> coincided with the eyespot pattern, which was similar to yellow  <cit> , suggesting that e <dig> had a marking specificity in the early molting stage. in manduca sexta, both e75a and e75b are involved in the stage-specific gene expression of ddc both directly and indirectly  <cit> . our results suggest that e75a and/or e75b regulate both the marking specificity and stage specificity of several black marking-associated genes. as we described previously, several cuticular protein genes also exhibited marking specificity and stage specificity . although it is still not clear how color and nanostructure are determined, one possible explanation is that marking-specific transcription factors involved in the ecdysteroid signaling cascade regulate both pigmentation and cuticular protein genes. e <dig> is one strong candidate mediator of the hormone-dependent coordination of larval pattern and nanostructure formation.

although spalt and e <dig> were the only two transcription factor genes for which we were able to detect marking-associated expression by whole-mount in situ hybridization, microarray analysis suggested that e region transcript mbeta and fringe, both involved in the notch signaling pathway, also have marking specificity. in the butterfly wing pattern, notch is involved in intervein markings  <cit> , and fringe is upregulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone  <cit> . the notch signaling pathway may also be involved in hormone-dependent pattern formation in butterfly larvae.

the marking-specific ecdysteroid biosynthesis enzyme gene, 3-dehydroecdysone 3b-reductase
unexpectedly, we found that the 3de 3b-reductase gene , which converts inactivated 3-dehydroecdysone to ecdysone  <cit> , had clear marking specificity during the late stage of the molting period. according to whole-mount in situ hybridization findings, 3de 3b-reductase was highly expressed in black markings in both mimetic and cryptic patterns , which is very similar to the th and ddc expression patterns. the simultaneous expression of 3de 3b-reductase and melanin synthesis enzyme genes suggested that localized regulation of ecdysteroid titers in the epidermis is also involved in marking-specific gene regulation. relatively high concentrations of ecdysone in the black markings may be important for regulating the th and ddc expressions during the pigmentation stages.

papilio-specific marking-associated genes
among  <dig>  p. xuthus genes , more than  <dig> genes had no sequence similarity with the genome sequences of other insects, including silkworm and monarch butterfly . through microarray analysis and whole-mount in situ hybridization, we found three papilio-specific genes , and one gene, px- <dig>  with only low sequence similarity with the monarch butterfly . px- <dig>  px- <dig> and px- <dig> expression coincided with black, yellow and eyespot markings, respectively . px- <dig> expression was also strongly associated with black markings . these proteins have no known domains and display no similarity to any characterized proteins. px- <dig> and px- <dig> have signal peptide sequences, and px- <dig>  px- <dig> and px- <dig> are threonine-, arginine-, and tyrosine-rich proteins, respectively . these genes were expressed during the middle or late stages of the molting period, suggesting that these genes were structural proteins. although the precise function of these genes is currently unknown, this is the first example of species-specific genes associated with pattern formation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we succeeded in obtaining a large-scale catalog of marking-specific genes and stage-specific genes from the swallowtail butterfly larvae by microarray analysis based on est datasets. we confirmed the marking specificity for transcription factors, hormone-related genes, cuticular protein genes, pigment synthesis and binding genes, and novel papilio-specific genes by whole-mount in situ hybridization. the marking-specific genes identified in this study indicated that the molecular mechanisms of insect pigmentation are likely to be both conserved and diversified across insect taxa. for example, several of the melanin synthesis genes with clear marking specificity in papilio species   <cit>  have been reported to be responsible for the larval color mutants of the silkworm b. mori  <cit> , as well as associated with the cuticular pigmentation of various insect orders  <cit> , which suggests their conserved role in cuticular pigmentation across insect taxa. conversely, our results also indicate that genes that have several paralogs in one species tend to diversify their function across insect taxa, such as yellow family genes, lipocalin family genes and takeout/jhbp family genes . we also found that there were several papilio-specific genes with clear marking specificity, suggesting that species-specific genes contribute to marking formation. notably, some of the regulatory genes involved in larval pattern appeared to be different from those of adults , whereas others appeared to participate in both larval and adult pattern formation . furthermore, we found that both the transcription factor e <dig> and the ecdysteroid synthesis enzyme 3de 3b-reductase had clear marking specificity, suggesting their involvement in ecdysteroid-dependent coordinated gene regulation in larval pattern formation. ecdysteroid is also involved in butterfly adult wing pattern  <cit> , which suggests the possibility that these genes contribute to pattern formation in the adult wing. the wide variety of marking-associated genes identified by our screening indicates that the strategy utilized in this study is effective for clarifying pattern formation in species without genome information. the gene collection and the expression profile presented in this study will be invaluable for exploring not only papilio but also insects in general.
