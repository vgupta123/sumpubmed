BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are mobile genetic sequences found within the genomes of most organisms. sequences derived from tes represent a genomic fraction of 3% in baker's yeast  <cit> , ~20% in fruit fly  <cit> , 45% in human  <cit>  and over 80% in maize  <cit> . they are thought to be important contributors to genome evolution by inserting into genes or genetic regulatory elements, thereby disrupting gene function, altering levels of gene expression, triggering chromosomal rearrangements, and adding to or subtracting from the physical size of a host genome  <cit> . tes are classified into two groups based on their mode of transposition: retrotransposons or class  <dig> tes which replicate through reverse transcription of an mrna intermediate, and dna transposons or class  <dig> tes that use a "cut and paste" mechanism.

a pervasive group of retrotransposons are those flanked by long terminal repeats , also typical of retroviruses to which they are related. the ltr direct sequence repeats flank the internal region that encodes both structural and enzymatic proteins with homology to the gag and pol proteins of retroviruses. the gag gene encodes structural proteins that form the virus-like particle , inside which reverse transcription takes place. the pol gene encodes several enzymatic functions, including a protease  that cleaves the pol polyprotein, a reverse transcriptase  that copies the retrotransposon rna into cdna, a ribonuclease h domain , and an integrase  that integrates the cdna into the genome. two main groups of ltr retrotransposons  are found throughout eukaryotes, and are distinguished by the organization of their pol genes and similarities among their encoded rt proteins  <cit> . these groups are referred to as ty1/copia elements  and ty3/gypsy elements , which respectively display a pr, in, rt, rh and pr, rt, rh, in gene organization.

the unicellular chlorophyll c-containing algal class bacillariophyceae  is among the most successful and diversified groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes, with possibly over  <dig>  extant species  <cit>  widespread in all kinds of humid and open water environments. the contribution of diatom photosynthesis to marine primary productivity has been estimated to be around 40%  <cit> . diatoms have a peculiar genetic makeup because they are likely to have emerged following a secondary endosymbiotic process between a photosynthetic eukaryote, most probably red algal-like, and a heterotrophic eukaryote  <cit> . they are traditionally divided into two orders: the centric diatoms which are radially symmetrical and are thought to have arisen around  <dig> million years ago , followed by the pennate diatoms around  <dig> mya which are bilaterally symmetrical. genome sequences of the centric diatom thalassiosira pseudonana and the pennate diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum have recently become available  <cit> . because diatoms are single celled organisms that typically reproduce mitotically, the activity of ltr-rts might have particularly profound effects on genome evolution since any non-lethal retroelement insertion will be transmitted to subsequent generations.

in an analysis of the t. pseudonana genome, armbrust and collaborators identified several tes  <cit> . in the current work, we have identified additional tes in both diatom genomes and we show that ltr-rts are the most abundant elements, particularly in p. tricornutum where they have amplified enormously. phylogenetic analysis of the rt domain shows that diatom ty1/copia-like elements belong to different lineages, and that two of them are diatom specific. examination of the camera metagenomic database reveals that these elements are also widespread in different oceans. the potential ecological relevance of these elements for driving genome and population evolution and heterogeneity has been assessed by examining their expression in response to stress as well as their distribution in p. tricornutum accessions collected from different locations worldwide. we also examine whether or not cis-regulatory elements within ltr sequences contain sufficient information for driving retrotransposon transcription in response to nitrate deprevation and if alterations in cytosine methylation play a role in retrotransposon expression.

RESULTS
expansion of ltr retrotransposons in the p. tricornutum genome
we first examined the te content of diatom genomes. in the t. pseudonana genome armbrust and collaborators identified some ty1/copia and ty3/gypsy-like elements, a family of rte-like non-ltr retrotransposons, mutator-like  and harbinger-like dna transposons, as well as some unknown unclassified repeated sequences  <cit> . in the present work, we could identify additional ltr-rt elements in the t. pseudonana genome . we also identified numerous ty1/copia-like elements in the p. tricornutum genome as well as an rte-like element, two distinct families of mutator-like elements , and two other different types of uncharacterized transposase-containing elements . ty3/gypsy-like elements were not found in the p. tricornutum genome .

to analyse the contribution of tes to diatom genomes we used the diatom te dna sequences to run the repeatmasker program  <cit>  on both genomes. in total, we found that tes contribute  <dig>  kb  of the p. tricornutum genome and  <dig> kb  of the t. pseudonana genome. of these, ltr-rts are the most abundant in both genomes and constitute 90% and 58% of the p. tricornutum and t. pseudonana te complement, respectively . harbinger elements also appear to represent a significant proportion in t. pseudonana. in total, the repeatmasker output indicated that sequences deriving from ltr-rts make up  <dig> % of the p. tricornutum genome  <cit>  and  <dig> % of the t. pseudonana genome  <cit>  . it thus appears that ty1/copia-like ltr-rts have significantly expanded in the p. tricornutum genome.

classification of ltr retrotransposon sequences
to further investigate the diatom ltr-rt elements, we manually screened the p. tricornutum and t. pseudonana nuclear genomes for the presence of putatively autonomous ltr-rts , and found a total of  <dig> and  <dig> putative active elements in the final unmasked assemblies of the p. tricornutum and t. pseudonana nuclear genomes, respectively. most of these have greater than 95% identical ltr pairs and display only one or no stop codon/frameshifts between the gag and pol genes . all the selected sequences from p. tricornutum and  <dig> from t. pseudonana belonged to the ty1/copia class with pol domains ordered as expected , and the two remaining sequences from t. pseudonana belonged to the ty3/gypsy class with pol domains also ordered in a typical fashion .

the  <dig> ty1/copia-like elements identified in the p. tricornutum and t. pseudonana genomes were classified on the basis of rt domain sequence similarity . seven groups of ty1/copia-like retroelements were identified and denoted codi <dig> to codi <dig>  . while the codi <dig> to codi <dig> groups are quite homogeneous, the codi <dig> group consists of a set of diverse elements. the codi <dig> group is composed of a single element from p. tricornutum . the codi1-2-3- <dig> groups are specific to p. tricornutum whereas the codi4-5- <dig> groups are composed of elements found in both diatom genomes. it appears that the codi <dig> and codi <dig> groups are major components of ltr-rt expansion in the p. tricornutum genome .

phylogenetic analysis
we constructed a phylogenetic tree from a clustalw multiple alignment of the rt domains from the ty1/copia-like shown in additional file  <dig> as well as reference sequences for the ty <dig> and copia lineages  . we observed a distribution of sequences into seven clusters corresponding to the groups defined previously . the most homogeneous clusters represent the groups codi1-2- <dig> composed of sequences present only in p. tricornutum. the ptc <dig> element representing the codi <dig> group appears distantly linked to the codi1- <dig> groups. the lineage linking the codi1-2-3-4- <dig> groups was denoted codii . like codi <dig>  the codi <dig> group is composed of sequences from both the centric and the pennate diatom and constitutes a separate lineage we called codiii. finally, the elements from the codi <dig> group which includes elements from both genomes cluster into a highly heterogeneous lineage together with the marker elements tnt and copia. in this tree, we can therefore recognize a class of diatom ty1/copia-like elements most closely related to known elements from the copia lineage as well as two diatom-specific lineages, codii and codiii .

to better clarify the evolutionary relationships between the ltr-rts from diatoms and other retrotransposable elements, we studied rt sequences from a representative subset of elements from each codi group defined on the basis of our previous analysis  and rt sequences that we identified from the pennate diatoms fragilariopsis cylindrus; pseudo-nitzschia multistriata, and pseudo-nitzschia multiseries. a phylogenetic representation of diatom rt domains with those belonging to the major lineages of ltr retrotransposons and retroviruses  showed that the heterogeneous codi <dig> group appears closest to the major copia lineage , which includes sequences from animals, plants, yeast, and heterokonts , which confirms the origin of the copia lineage as deeply rooted in eukaryotes. this tree also confirms the distant evolutionary relationships that link the elements from the codii lineage to the ty <dig> and copia lineages and the even more distant relationships that link the codiii lineage to these other elements. we also note that the rt sequences from the other diatoms cluster in the codii, codiii and copia lineages, and that the ty3/gypsy-like elements from t. pseudonana, p. multiseries and p. multistriata also segregate together in a diatom-specific cluster .

expression of ltr retrotransposons in p. tricornutum and t. pseudonana
to examine te expression, the complete nucleotide sequences of the full length elements from p. tricornutum listed in additional file  <dig> were searched in the diatom digital gene expression database   <cit>  using blast. this database comprises more than  <dig>  ests from p. tricornutum and t. pseudonana cells grown in a range of different conditions, many of which correspond to different abiotic stresses. the global est profile of each codi group reveals a pattern of higher expression levels under some stress conditions . in particular, we focused on two p. tricornutum codi <dig> lineage elements that were strongly induced under conditions of nitrate starvation and following exposure to the toxic reactive aldehyde decadienal  . these were denoted blackbeard  and surcouf , respectively, and the contribution of codi <dig> and codi <dig> to the nitrate deplete and dd high libraries are due exclusively to these elements. qrt-pcr was subsequently used to confirm their upregulation in response to nitrogen starvation and following exposure to dd .
*fold change with respect to expression levels in untreated cultures

regulation of blackbeard
in an effort to better understand blackbeard expression in response to nitrogen limitation, we examined its transcriptional and chromatin-level regulation. because cis-acting elements regulating ltr-rt expression are typically found within ltrs  <cit> , we generated a construct containing the blackbeard ltr fused to the β-glucoronidase  reporter gene. although the blackbeard ltr is only  <dig> bp, spectrophotometric gus measurements on p. tricornutum lines transformed with this construct showed that it was sufficient to activate transcription in response to nitrate starvation . this shows that the blackbeard ltr alone contains sufficient cis-regulatory element information to drive blackbeard expression in response to nitrate limitation.

cytosine methylation is commonly found in the dna sequences of transposable elements  and is thought to be involved in the heterochromatin formation and maintenance that controls te mobility. te mobilization has been shown to be associated with dna hypomethylation  <cit> , and hypomethylation has also been found to accompany active transposition in response to stress  <cit> . we therefore assessed whether the blackbeard element was methylated using mcrpcr. in this method, dna is digested with mcrbc which cleaves dna containing methylcytosine. consequently, pcr using mcrbc-digested dna as template leads to a decrease of amplification at methylated  loci with respect to untreated dna. we first observed that all ltr-rts tested were methylated in the p. tricornutum genome under normal growth conditions , demonstrating that dna methylation does occur in this diatom. we then compared mcrpcr amplification levels using dna extracted from p. tricornutum cells grown in normal and nitrate limiting conditions. figures 5b and 5c show that the induction of blackbeard in response to nitrate limitation was accompanied by a decrease in cytosine methylation, suggesting that chromatin remodeling occurs at the blackbeard locus in response to nitrate limitation. preliminary results from bisulfite sequencing indicate that methylation at the blackbeard locus occurs in a cpg context .

insertion polymorphism between p. tricornutum accessions
although suggestive, the induction of bkb expression by nitrate limitation is not proof that it can actually drive genome rearrangements by de novo insertion in the genome. in order to better evaluate this possibility, we assessed the distribution of bkb elements in thirteen p. tricornutum accessions collected from different locations worldwide by sequence specific amplified polymorphism   <cit>  . ssap amplifies the region between a pcr primer site near the end of an element and an adjacent restriction site in the flanking genomic dna. this global analysis revealed clear differences in bkb insertion profiles in different accessions, demonstrating that it has been transposing in natural environments . we were able to confirm the same phenomenon with two other elements, scf and ptc <dig> . we subsequently cloned several bands from the ssap gel in order to determine some insertion sites in accessions other than the sequenced genotype . none of the sequences we obtained were inserted inside genes, and most were inserted into intergenic regions, sometimes very close to coding sequences. for example, a ptc <dig> insertion found in pt6-7- <dig> is located  <dig> bp upstream of the 5' utr of the gene encoding uroporphyrinogen-iii synthase, which catalyses the sixth step of heme biosynthesis. we also found several sequences corresponding to bkb and scf inserted into other tes .

two distinct haplotypes at loci containing tes
analysis of sequencing reads around several te insertion sites revealed that many were inserted in just one of the haplotypes and that the other haplotype was apparently intact. as an example, the blackbeard insertion is shown in figure 7a and additional file  <dig>  for this  insertion events, we could verify by pcr that the allelic specificity is conserved in all accessions in which they are found , whereas in the other accessions we could only detect the empty locus . because the oldest of these accessions was collected more than one hundred years ago  <cit> , we can conclude that the bkb insertion must have occurred before this time.

te-mediated recombination in the p. tricornutum genome
to shed light on the potential impact of ltr-rts on genome dynamics, we analyzed some signatures of intra- or inter-element recombination in the p. tricornutum and t. pseudonana genomes  <cit> . unequal intrastrand homologous recombination between ltrs of different elements belonging to the same family is a typical example and can result in a net loss of the dna in between the elements involved. five examples of this were found in our study of the p. tricornutum genome, all of which resulted in clearly recognizable recombinant products in which apparently intact elements with more than 99% identical ltrs lacked the target-site duplication   and were therefore expected to be the product of homologous recombination between two family members. on the other hand, we found no example of this kind in the t. pseudonana genome.

we also noticed that the two elements constituting the codi <dig>  family, ptc <dig>  and ptc <dig> , both lacked a tsd . closer examination of these loci revealed evidence that these two elements have been co-involved in a recombination event . specifically, we found that the 5' flanking region of ptc <dig> consists of a truncated codi <dig>  element and that the 3' flanking sequence of ptc <dig> also consists of a truncated codi <dig>  which is the exact continuation of the ptc25-flanking entity but in addition contains a duplication of an acaag motif. the most parsimonious explanation for this organization is that either ptc <dig> or ptc <dig> inserted inside a codi <dig>  element and that this insertion generated duplication of the target site . subsequently, ptc <dig> and ptc <dig> engaged in a recombination event that split the codi <dig>  element into the two halves found on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> 

furthermore, these two genomic regions contain a group of  <dig> orthologs of an unknown gene family . the segment containing the two copies located on chromosome  <dig> and their intergenic region is located less than  <dig> kb downstream of the codi <dig> -like element and is highly similar  to the segment containing two of the copies located on chromosome  <dig> and their intergenic region. the pt2_ <dig> gene in fact appears to be the product of recombination between two distinct orthologs as its beginning and downstream region is similar to the pt2_ <dig> locus and its end and upstream region appears most similar to the pt2_ <dig> and pt2_ <dig> loci . a > <dig> kb region between the pt2_ <dig> locus and the codi <dig>  segment is also duplicated elsewhere in the genome. these loci therefore provide compelling evidence for te-mediated recombination events in the p. tricornutum genome.

a high diversity of rt domains from micro-planktonic organisms
very little or no data about rt sequences are available from other eukaryotic clades that include planktonic organisms of ecological importance such as dinoflagellates and coccolithophores. in order to investigate deeper the diversity of ltr-rts that can be found in planktonic organisms, we used our diatom te dataset to screen the camera metagenomic database http://camera.calit <dig> net/, which contains sequences from environmental samples collected during the global ocean sampling  and sargasso sea surveys  <cit> . these sequences are derived from micro-organisms that were trapped on filters of different sizes  from the surface water of various parts of the globe including caribbean sea, eastern tropical pacific, galapagos islands, north american east coast, polynesia archipelagos, and sargasso sea. the size of the database for each filter and at each geographical position is indicated in figure 9a.

we queried by blast our entire set of rt domains against the camera protein dataset and retrieved a total of  <dig> subject sequences , all of which have an ltr-rt for best hit by blast comparison with genbank . after normalizing the number of hits from each filter size by its cognate sample size, we observed that the larger the pore size of the filter, the more abundant is the rt domain, with about  <dig>  rt domains per mb of sequence from the  <dig> - <dig>  μm filters . a total of  <dig> of these sequences could be included unambiguously in our rt domain alignment and were used to build a phylogenetic tree in which we also incorporated rt sequences from the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii and ostreococcus tauri, the brown alga aureococcus anophagefferens, and the rt domain from the pyre10g element found in the red alga porphyra yezoensis  <cit>  . as expected, we observed an enormous diversity within gos sequences. it was found that gos rt domains clustered with all the ltr-rt lineages described here, including the codii and codiii lineages. however, rt domains belonging to the ty3/gypsy, copia, and the recently identified red/aquatic species  lineage  <cit>  are the most abundant in the dataset analyzed. we also noticed that the ras-like lineage appears to be quite a diverse assemblage . these ras-like elements appear to be the most abundant in the sargasso sea samples, especially from the  <dig> - <dig>  μm filters .

discussion
in this work, we have identified seven groups of ty1/copia-like ltr-retrotransposons in diatom genomes. four groups  were found only in the p. tricornutum genome whereas elements belonging to the codi4-5- <dig> groups were detected in both diatom genomes. the presence of both classes suggests either that they were present in the diatom common ancestor and that the codi1- <dig> groups became extinct in the lineage leading to the centric species t. pseudonana, or that representatives of each group have been separately introduced horizontally in pennate and centric diatoms. the topology of the tree presented in figure  <dig> shows that codi <dig> and codi <dig> are bootstrap-supported sister groups that share a common ancestor after the separation from codi <dig> and codi <dig>  this, together with the fact that we could not detect traces of diverged remnant copies from the codi1- <dig> groups in the t. pseudonana genome by blast searches  favors the horizontal transfer hypothesis to explain the presence of codi <dig> elements in the t. pseudonana genome.

ty3/gypsy-like elements were found in the t. pseudonana genome but not in the p. tricornutum genome. we also identified rt sequences corresponding to ty3/gypsy-like elements from the pennate diatoms p. multiseries and p. multistriata which clearly cluster with the gydi elements . although the number of diatom species for which data is available is low, this suggests that ty3/gypsy-like elements were likely present in the diatom common ancestor, and that these elements have been lost in p. tricornutum.

the mutagenic potential of ltr retrotransposons  <cit>  and the effects of their accumulation  <cit>  and recombination  <cit>  together suggest that active retrotransposons may be major contributors to genome diversification. accumulated data indicates that retrotransposons in plants  <cit> , animals and fungi respond to various forms of stress. it has also been shown in natural wild barley populations living on each side of a canyon that ltr retrotransposon dynamics contribute to genome diversity in response to sharp microclimatic divergence  <cit> . ltr-rts are hence thought to play a key role in long term adaptation of natural populations exposed to stress by generating genetic diversity within populations. evidence presented here suggests that this may also be the case in diatoms. for example, blackbeard is one of the most highly expressed genes in the est library derived from p. tricornutum cells grown under nitrate starvation and surcouf is highly expressed in response to dd treatment . if these expression levels correlate with completion of the retrotransposition cycle, which ends with de novo insertions, then nitrate starvation, dd exposure, and perhaps other environmental stressors could lead to an increase in genetic diversity in p. tricornutum. ltr-rts may therefore be major drivers of genetic diversity in p. tricornutum populations. although we have not been able to observe de novo insertion of bkb or scf elements following stress, this claim is supported by the different insertions that have been observed in p. tricornutum accessions isolated from different locations around the world .

the significance of these findings is strengthened by the ecological relevance and common occurrence of stress in marine environments. nitrogen is the most widespread limiting nutrient for marine phytoplankton  <cit> , and transitions between nitrate starved stratified waters and nitrate replete upwelling conditions are a major influence governing marine diatom population oscillations  <cit> . conversely, diatom-derived unsaturated aldehydes can regulate intercellular signalling, stress surveillance, and defence against grazers  <cit> . diatoms can sense these aldehydes accurately, whereby subthreshold levels serve as an early-warning protective mechanism, and lethal doses initiate a cascade leading to autocatalytic cell death. activation of surcouf only after exposure to high levels of aldehydes supports a threshold-dependent response in which activation only occurs under acute stress conditions. furthermore, the fact that significant aldehyde concentrations are only produced by nutrient-stressed and wounded diatoms suggests a possible role in long term adaptation to abiotic and biotic stress  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
sexual reproduction in p. tricornutum has never been documented. here, we have seen that blackbeard and surcouf insertions occurred at least a century ago and that both  have remained in a heterozygous state until now, in accordance with rare or absent meiotic cycles and only limited crossing overs between chromosome pairs in p. tricornutum. the maintenance of ltr-rt insertions in a heterozygous state in the p. tricornutum genome could increase the genetic variability between haplotypes and hence enhance adaptation capacity to changing environments. furthermore, the observation that the blackbeard element is hypomethylated in response to nitrate starvation provides a direct link between environmental stress and chromatin remodeling in diatoms. such phenomena can confer phenotypic plasticity to an individual species, especially if they are heritable, and may be more useful for environmental adaptation than dna-based modifications, which are irreversible and more likely to lead to speciation and therefore reproductive isolation. it is therefore possible that epigenetic modifications, combined with te-mediated genomic rearrangements, maintain population diversity in p. tricornutum, as opposed to sex-driven chromosomal recombination. the potential capacity of such processes to monitor and to respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions may have contributed to the evolutionary and ecological success of diatoms in contemporary oceans.
