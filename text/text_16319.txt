BACKGROUND
from a comparative genomics standpoint the great apes are among the most studied groups of organisms  <cit> . since the completion of human genome sequencing in  <dig>  <cit>  the genomes of all species belonging to this family have been or are being sequenced  <cit> . although only the human reference genome is considered of finished quality  <cit> , it is possible to compare and also use these genomes sequences as references for the alignment of reads generated in sequencing and gene expression studies. in addition to determine the dna sequence of a genome, it is of particular importance to attach biological information to it e.g. determine the location and structure of protein-coding genes. gene annotation is carried out both computationally and experimentally by sequencing cdna e.g. traditionally using expressed sequence tags   <cit>  and more recently rna-seq  <cit> . human est resources are also more abundant than their non-human counterparts and therefore human gene annotation is also the most accurate among great apes  <cit> . while the majority of efforts have focused on the annotation of protein-coding genes, the discovery of large-scale transcription outside of protein-coding genes  <cit>  has led to the identification of a great diversity of non-protein-coding rna genes  <cit> . among these are the micrornas  which are short  rna molecules  <cit>  that post-transcriptionally down-regulate protein-coding gene expression  <cit> . the official repository of mirnas mirbase   <cit>  contains  <dig>  human mirna, whereas fewer mirnas are annotated in other primate genomes , a fact that is explained by the larger number of human studies.

mirnas have been annotated in humans using a mixture of bioinformatics prediction and cdna sequencing  <cit> . the identification of mirnas in non-human primates has made use of a number of comparative methodologies such as sequence homology between closely related organisms  <cit> , the genomic search for rna secondary structure patterns characteristic of mirnas  <cit>  and by direct sequencing of small rna libraries  <cit> . however, direct characterization of small rna libraries by high throughput sequencing has been performed for a limited number of tissues in only chimpanzees and rhesus macaques <cit> . as a result the majority of non-human primate mirnas in mirbase have no evidence for their expression and their existence is only supported by computational prediction. in the present study we sequenced small rna libraries from multiple chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and rhesus macaque individuals and tissues using the illumina high throughput sequencing platform. we applied an algorithm  that uses sequencing reads in conjunction with a model of mirna biogenesis to predict mirnas with high accuracy <cit> .

RESULTS
mirna prediction
we used the program mirdeep <dig>  <cit>  to predict mirnas from sequenced small rnas. mirdeep <dig> takes as input the position and frequency of reads aligned to the genome  with respect to a putative rna hairpin and scores the mirna candidate employing a probabilistic model based on mirna biogenesis  <cit> . the score produced by mirdeep takes into account the energetic stability of the putative hairpin and the compatibility of the observed read distribution with mirna cleavage  <cit> . the more positive the score the more reliable the prediction. additionally, mirdeep <dig> calculates false-positive rates by running the algorithm on a set of "signatures" and secondary structures that are paired by random permutation. using predictions with a positive score and a significant folding p-value we identified from our sequences  <dig>  new mirnas in chimpanzee,  <dig>  in gorilla,  <dig>  in orangutan and  <dig>  in rhesus macaque. mirdeep <dig> was able to predict  <dig>  known mirnas  in chimpanzee,  <dig>  in gorilla,  <dig>  in orangutan and  <dig>  in rhesus macaque . mirdeep <dig> performance statistics were similar to the ones reported in other species  <cit>  .

mirnas show high expression conservation between species, and tissue-specific expression patterns  <cit> . in testis we found a lower fraction of the total reads align to mirnas  as a result of the expression of an additional class of small-rnas in this tissue - pirnas  <cit> . we were able to identify  <dig> tissue-specific mirnas in chimpanzee ,  <dig> in gorilla ,  <dig> in orangutan  and  <dig> in rhesus macaque .

column 1: individual information; column 2: tissue; column 3: fraction of reads that could be mapped perfectly to species corresponding genome; columns 4- <dig> are based on the reads that could be mapped to the corresponding species genome and contain how many of these reads could be aligned to known mirnas , newly predicted mirnas  and to neither of these  <dig> categories ; column 7: total number of sequenced reads.

to identify mirnas which are shared between all the primates studied here we examined mirnas that are encoded in orthologous locations in all four primate species and in human. for the mirnas present in mirbase  we found  <dig> mirnas that are located in orthologous regions in human and the four non-human primate species. when we included the set of mirnas predicted in this study we increased this number to  <dig> mirnas. this set of mirnas can be considered prediction of high confidence since they were known in human and either known or predicted by us in all other four primate species.

sequence identity
all  <dig> of the known mirnas present in all four species and human showed a high sequence identity i.e. the sequence is completely identical between the mature sequences for all of them. using the set of  <dig> mirnas we were able to reconstruct the expected phylogenetic relationships between the species studied for both the hairpin and the mature sequence. a principle component analysis on the sequence identity between hairpin sequences  shows a close relationship between chimpanzee and gorilla while both species are distant from orangutan and even more afar to rhesus macaque.

secondary structure
for some stages during their biogenesis mirnas form a secondary structure that resembles a hairpin  <cit> . since the endonuclease that processes mirnas recognizes them based on their three-dimensional structure  <cit> , the stability of the secondary structure can be considered a proxy for mirna functionality and therefore for the reliability of mirnas predictions. we used the minimum free energy  as a measure of structure stability. we found that the hairpins of predicted mirnas are as stable as hairpins from known mirnas, which is not unexpected given that the score calculated by mirdeep <dig> takes into account the stability of the mirna hairpin secondary structure.

discussion
although the genomes of multiple non-human primates have been sequenced, the functional annotation of the human genome remains the most complete among primates. this is the case for mirnas annotated in mirbase, where the number of human mirnas is double than mirnas annotated in chimpanzee   <cit> . in the present study we sequenced small rna libraries from multiple individuals and tissues in four non-human primates in order to identify from expression data new mirna genes. we identified these new mirnas using mirdeep <dig>  <cit> , which uses a model for mirna precursor processing by dicer to score mirna predictions. using this approach we predicted  <dig> new mirnas in chimpanzee,  <dig> in gorilla,  <dig> in orangutan and  <dig> in rhesus macaque . we found that the secondary structures from our new mirnas were as stable as mirnas previously described in mirbase.

a similar number of new mirnas were identified in chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus macaque, whereas the number of new mirna predictions in gorilla was much higher. while the genomes of the chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus have been available for some time, and a number of mirna studies in these species published, the gorilla genome has not yet been published and fully annotated  <cit> , and no published description of mirnas in gorilla - a requirement for inclusion of new mirnas in mirbase - exists the majority of annotated mirnas in the non-human primates are based on homology with human mirnas  <cit> . however, the presence of a given locus in a genome is not a guarantee of its expression. we have, in this study, provided evidence of expression for 51% of the homology-based annotated mirnas in gorilla, 49% in chimpanzee and 60% in rhesus macaque. we increased from  <dig> to  <dig> the number of mirnas, which are located in orthologous regions in the four non-human primate genomes studied here and in human. this is a set of high confidence mirnas based on homology, expression and mirna biogenesis signatures.

in addition to the analysis of expression and folding, mirdeep incorporates a model of mirna biogenesis, which makes its predictions more accurate than other software  <cit> . while the sequencing of small rna libraries is now technically feasible, the accurate identification of novel mirnas remains challenging. a pioneer study in primates sequenced small rnas libraries from human and chimpanzee brains  <cit> . they predicted a large number  of new mirnas in both species based on small rna sequencing. only few of these mirnas have been included in mirbase, the public, curated repository for mirnas . it is important to identify novel mirnas accurately, and therefore particularly important to take into account the effect of genome quality and completeness on the ability to determine whether particular mirnas are species-specific in primate comparisons the higher quality and completeness of the human genome means that mirnas are frequently described as human-specific when in fact they are simply missed in related primate genomes due to sequence quality issues.

we sought to identify mirnas that are expressed in tissue-specific manner. for species where we had samples from five tissues  we could say with more confidence that a given mirna is tissue-specific than for the species where we had only two tissues . brain was the tissue with both more mirnas in total, and more tissue-specific mirnas both in chimpanzee and marginally in rhesus. in orangutan and gorilla we could only identify mirnas that are expressed mutually exclusively in either liver or brain. we found more mirnas expressed exclusively in brain than in liver. this is in agreement with the fact that the mirna repertoire in humans, chimpanzees and rhesus macaques is more diverse in brain compared to other tissues  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have sequenced small rna libraries from multiple individuals and tissues from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and rhesus macaque. we identified known mirnas and used mirdeep <dig> to predict de novo micrornas in these four primate species. our new expression-based predictions increased the number of known mirnas in all four species. in addition, we showed the first expression evidence for mirnas that were previously only annotated by sequence homology with humans. accurate annotation of mirnas in multiple primate species provides a fundamental to carry out evolutionary, comparative and functional studies of mirnas.
