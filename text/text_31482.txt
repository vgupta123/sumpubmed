BACKGROUND
nitrogen is incorporated into glutamate and glutamine which form the major biosynthetic donors for all other nitrogen containing components in a cell. glutamine is a source of nitrogen for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, a number of amino acids, glucosamine and ρ-benzoate, whereas glutamate provides nitrogen for most transaminases  <cit>  and is responsible for 85% of nitrogenous compounds in a cell  <cit> . in most prokaryotes, there are two major routes for ammonium assimilation. the glutamine synthetase  and glutamate synthase  cyclic mechanism is largely active when exogenous nitrogen concentrations are limiting, due to the high affinity of gs for ammonium. this pathway utilizes approximately 15% of the cell's atp requirement  <cit>  for the production of glutamine and its activity is, therefore, strictly regulated at both transcriptional and post-translational levels in order to prevent energy wastage .

under conditions of nitrogen excess, glutamine synthetase activity is reduced via adenylylation by the adenylyltransferase glne  <cit>  and under these conditions, the low ammonium affinity glutamate dehydrogenase  pathway plays a major assimilatory role with a comparatively low associated energy cost  <cit> . gdh enzymes catalyse the reversible amination of α-ketoglutarate to form glutamate  with concomitant reduction of nadh. they also serve as metabolic branch enzymes as the gdh enzymes are involved in anapleurotic processes which regulate the flux of intermediates such as α-ketoglutarate between the krebs cycle and nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . the gdh enzymes identified in prokaryotes usually function with either nadp+  or nad+  as co-factors whilst in higher eukaryotes the enzymes have dual co-factor specificity . nadp+-specific enzymes are normally involved in the assimilation of nitrogen via amination of α-ketoglutarate  <cit>  and may be transcriptionally regulated by a variety of growth conditions, including carbon and nitrogen limitation  <cit> . in contrast, nad+-specific gdh enzymes are thought to be largely involved in glutamate catabolism   <cit>  and do not appear to be regulated in response to ammonium limitation  <cit> . gdh enzymes described to date are oligomeric structures and can be grouped into three subgroups according to subunit composition. many nadp+- and nad+-gdh enzymes from a number of organisms are hexameric structures made up of subunits that are approximately  <dig> kda in size  <cit> . the second gdh class comprise nad+-specific gdh enzymes with tetrameric structures whose subunits have a molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda  <cit> . recently, a third class of oligomeric nad+-specific gdh enzymes was defined whose subunits are approximately  <dig> kda in size  <cit> .

information regarding nitrogen metabolism and its regulation in the mycobacteria is relatively limited. glutamine synthetase  has traditionally formed an isolated focal point of study with regard to nitrogen metabolism in the mycobacteria as it has been associated with mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence and pathogenicity  <cit> . it has previously been demonstrated that gs from pathogenic mycobacterial species such as m. tuberculosis and m. bovis is exported,  <cit>  yet the reasons for this phenomenon and the mechanism of export remain obscure  <cit> . it has been speculated that extracellular gs may play a role in the production of poly-l-glutamine-glutamate  <cit> , a polymer found only in pathogenic mycobacterial cell walls, and/or that extracellular gs activity may modulate phagosome ph and thereby prevent phagasome-lysosome fusion  <cit> . comparatively little is known about gs in other mycobacterial species, such as mycobacterium smegmatis, or gdh in the mycobacteria as a whole. the m. smegmatis genome encodes for a variety of putative glutamine synthetase enzymes which encode for each of the four possible classes of gs proteins  <cit> , many of which serve unknown functions. of these homologs, msmeg_ <dig> has the greatest amino acid identity to glna <dig> in m. tuberculosis, which encodes for a gs type  <dig> ammonium assimilatory enzyme  <cit> . the m. smegmatis gs seems different to m. tuberculosis gs in that it does not appear to be expressed to such a high level, nor does it appear to be exported to the extracellular milieu  <cit> .

the m. smegmatis genome also encodes for an nadp+-gdh  which was isolated by sarada et al.  <cit> ; an l_ <dig> class nad+-gdh   <cit>  as well a second putative nad+-gdh enzyme . in contrast, the m. tuberculosis genome only encodes for a single putative nad+-specific gdh  whose activity was detected in culture filtrates by ahmad et al  <cit> . the enzyme shares a 71% amino acid identity with msmeg_ <dig> and may also belong to the l_ <dig> class of nad+-gdh  <cit> .

nad+-specific glutamate dehydrogenases belonging to the l_ <dig> class have been characterised in four organisms to date, namely streptomyces clavuligerus  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit> , psychrobacter sp. tad <dig>  <cit>  and janthinobacterium lividum  <cit> , however little functional work has been done on these enzymes. it has very recently been found that the nad+-gdh  isolated from m. smegmatis may belong to this class and that it's activity is affected by the binding of a small protein, gara. this small protein is highly conserved amongst the actinomycetes and was given the name glycogen accumulation regulator  due to its observed effects on glycogen metabolism in mycobacterium smegmatis  <cit> , however it's precise function remained unclear at the time. gara has a fork-head associated  domain which is able to mediate protein-protein interactions as well as a highly conserved n-terminal phosphorylation motif in which a single threonine residue may be phosphorylated by either serine/threonine kinase b   <cit>  or serine/threonine kinase g   <cit>  thereby presumably playing a role in phosphorylation-dependant regulation mechanisms  <cit> . it has been shown that odh <dig>  is able to bind 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, a key tca cycle enzyme, and cause a reduction in it's activity. this inhibition of enzyme activity was removed by phosphorylation of odh <dig> by pkng  <cit> . a similar phenomenon has been observed in m. smegmatis with regards to the modulation of nad+-gdh by gara. native or unphosphorylated gara has been shown to be able to interact with nad+-gdh causing a reduction in nad+-gdh activity by altering the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate  <cit> . this binding, however, is prevented by the phosphorylation of gara  <cit>  by pkng. the conditions under which pkng is stimulated to phosphorylate or dephosphorylate gara has not yet been investigated and it is not clear how the relationship between gara, nad+-gdh and pkng may impact nitrogen metabolism in the mycobacteria.

the physiological roles as well as the regulation of the major effectors of nitrogen metabolism  in m. smegmatis remains unclear. as the adaptive mechanisms of the mycobacteria to limited nitrogen availability remain vague, an investigation into the changes in activity and transcription of both glutamine synthetase and the glutamate dehydrogenase enzymes under various conditions of ammonium availability in m. smegmatis, as a model for the mycobacteria, has been undertaken. 

RESULTS
gdh specific activity in response to ammonium limitation and excess
to investigate the effect of nitrogen availability on gdh activity, m. smegmatis was cultured in minimal medium containing a limited amount of ammonium 2so4). the specific activity of both the aminating and deaminating reactions catalysed by nad+- and nadp+-gdh  was determined from m. smegmatis whole cell lysates sampled at 0;  <dig> ;  <dig> and  <dig> hour intervals. the effect of an ammonium pulse 2so4) on gdh activity was determined after  <dig>  and  <dig> hours exposure to those conditions.

the nadp+-gdh forward or aminating reaction activity in m. smegmatis did not change appreciably in response to ammonium availability as can be seen by the absence of any significant change in activity between  <dig> hr and  <dig>  or  <dig> hr nitrogen starvation . this was also true for m. smegmatis exposed to an ammonium pulse . it would appear as though the nadp+-gdh aminating reaction activity of m. smegmatis exposed to nitrogen limitation remained greater than that of m. smegmatis exposed to ammonium excess conditions . this, however, could be misleading as, at certain time points, the bacteria were exposed to similar conditions of nitrogen availability in each experiment. for example, m. smegmatis incubated for  <dig> hr in media containing  <dig> mm nh4+ at time point  <dig> hr before being starved of nitrogen  was the same as after  <dig> hr exposure to ammonium excess conditions . the activity of the nadp+-gdh reaction is expected to be relatively similar under homologous conditions, thus the disparity observed may be due to slight experimental differences in the amount of starting material, assay conditions or absorbance readings measured during the activity assays. our results also show that nadp+-gdh aminating reaction activity did not change significantly in response to prolonged exposure to nitrogen limitation . this lack of change in m. smegmatis nadp+-gdh reaction activity is in contrast to a recent study in which nadp+-gdh animating activity was found to increase significantly in response to nitrogen starvation in a related actinomycete, corynebacterium glutamicum  <cit> . in other bacterial species, nadp+-gdh forward reaction activity has been shown to be down-regulated in response to nitrogen excess  <cit>  or not regulated at all  <cit> .

*p-values less than  <dig>   were regarded as statistically significant changes in specific activity from the previous time point.

upon analysis of the nadp+-gdh reverse or deaminating reaction activity, our results showed that there was a significant change in activity in response to nitrogen availability in m. smegmatis  thereby suggesting nadp+-gdh is indeed regulated in response to varying nitrogen concentration conditions. when exposed to ammonium starvation conditions, there was a  <dig> fold increase  in nadp+-gdh deaminating reaction activity , which remained constant throughout an extended period of nitrogen starvation . the converse effect was observed under conditions of nitrogen excess, namely a rapid, approximately  <dig> fold decrease in reaction activity . since nadp+-gdh performs a reversible reaction, it is interesting to note that a change only in the deaminating reaction activity in response to nitrogen availability was detected. the functional significance of the observed change in glutamate deamination is unclear. it may be that the modulation of glutamate catabolism serves to maintain the intracellular glutamate/2-oxoglutarate ratios which is known to co-ordinate a number of cellular activities such as growth rate modulation  <cit> ; maintenance of intracellular potassium pools  <cit>  and protection from high osmotic environments  <cit> .

there are two possible nad+-gdh enzymes encoded by the m. smegmatis genome. the highly nad+ specific gdh encoded by msmeg_ <dig> was isolated and characterised by o'hare et al.  <cit>  which showed great similarity to the novel class of large gdh enzymes known as the l_ <dig> class  <cit> . the second putative nad+-gdh is encoded by msmeg_ <dig> and has an approximate subunit size of  <dig> kda  <cit> . this enzyme may fall into the  <dig> kda class of large gdh's, however the presence of a functional protein is yet to be shown. under our experimental conditions, the total nad+-gdh deaminating reaction activity was very low and did not notably alter in response to changing ammonium concentrations  nor to prolonged ammonium starvation conditions . this observation may be attributable to the very low glutamate affinity of the l_ <dig> class of nad+-gdh   <cit> . in contrast, the nad+-gdh aminating reaction activity was much higher and was significantly changed by ammonium availability . during nitrogen starvation, the total nad+-gdh aminating activity tended to increase  and remained elevated but relatively constant throughout the ammonium starvation time course study , presumably in order to assist nitrogen assimilation under these conditions. in response to an ammonium pulse, the total nad+-gdh aminating activity was reduced almost  <dig> fold . this decrease in activity may be due to the presence of a constitutively active nadp+-gdh which could adequately assimilate nitrogen under these conditions. in m. smegmatis, it would appear that at least one of the possible nad+-gdh enzymes plays a largely anabolic or aminating role, which is in contrast with the opinion that nad+-gdh enzymes are normally involved in glutamate catabolism  <cit> . in addition, it would appear that at least one of the nad+-gdh enzymes present in m. smegmatis is regulated in response to nitrogen availability. it may be that the regulation of nad+-gdh activity in response to nitrogen availability may be due to the interaction of non-phosphorylated gara with the enzyme under conditions of nitrogen excess and this interaction may be abolished by pkng mediated phosphorylation of gara under conditions of nitrogen starvation.

glutamine synthetase specific activity in response to ammonium limitation and excess
the activity of the high ammonium affinity gs enzyme was assessed using the γ-glutamyl transferase assay  <cit> . upon exposure to nitrogen limitation, m. smegmatis gs activity increased significantly  within  <dig>  hrs and continued to increase significantly after  <dig> hr of nitrogen starvation  to reach a final activity at  <dig> hrs that was approximately  <dig>  fold greater than at zero hours . when an ammonium pulse was applied to nitrogen starved cells, gs activity decreased significantly  within  <dig> hr of exposure to nitrogen excess. our results are in accordance with studies done in a variety of bacteria, including m. tuberculosis, which have shown that gs activity is up-regulated  in response to nitrogen limitation and conversely regulated in response to nitrogen excess  <cit> . in m. tuberculosis, this regulation is achieved by post-translational adenylylation of gs  <cit> , and transcriptional control  <cit> . these results indicate that, under our experimental conditions, m. smegmatis did sense  <dig> mm 2so <dig> as a nitrogen starvation condition since gs activity was up-regulated, most likely in order to scavenge ammonium from the environment. in addition,  <dig> mm 2so <dig> was perceived as a condition of nitrogen sufficiency, as gs activity was down-regulated in order to prevent a futile energy depleting cycle.

* the p-values given show the statistical significance of the change in gs specific activity between time points. p <  <dig>   was regarded as a statistically significant change in specific activity from the previous time point.

relative quantification of gene transcription
the response to nitrogen availability at the mrna level of genes encoding for gs , nadp+-gdh  and the l_ <dig> nad+-gdh  was assessed by semi-quantitative real-time pcr  <cit> . the relative change in gene expression was calculated as a ratio of target gene transcription versus the transcription of siga, as an internal control.

a significant up-regulation  of glna <dig> gene transcription was observed within  <dig>  hrs exposure to nitrogen starvation and continued to increase significantly thereafter . this was an expected result as similar increases have been reported in m. smegmatis  <cit> . within the first hour, the increase in gene transcription was relatively low which indicated that the requirement for the synthesis for additional gs protein was not very high. it has previously been reported that a surprisingly large quantity of gs is produced by m. tuberculosis and is exported to the extracellular milieu  <cit> . although m. smegmatis does not export gs  <cit> , it may be that, similar to m. tuberculosis, a large intracellular pool of gs is present whose activity could be up-regulated via de-adenylylation by glne  <cit>  and thereby satisfy the need for ammonium assimilation under these conditions. after  <dig> hrs exposure to nitrogen starvation, there was a profound increase in glna <dig> transcription  which may reflect a heightened state of intracellular nitrogen starvation and thus the requirement for increased levels of gs enzyme in order to efficiently assimilate ammonium under these conditions. the relatively constant increase in gs activity under the same conditions  was most likely due a combination of an increase in glna <dig> transcription and very strict control of gs activity by the adenylyltransferase, glne, in order to balance ammonium assimilation; energy expenditure and the intracellular glutamate/glutamine ratios. when an ammonium pulse was applied to m. smegmatis that had been starved of nitrogen, a down-regulation in transcription was observed, however, it was not found to be statistically significant . there was, however, a rapid and significant decrease in gs specific activity when the bacteria were exposed to an ammonium pulse  which suggests that post-translational modification via glne is responsible for the swift response in gs activity to changing ammonium concentrations.

a the relative change in gene expression when m. smegmatis was exposed to nitrogen starvation was compared to gene expression after m. smegmatis exposed to  <dig> mm 2so <dig> for  <dig> hours . siga was used as the internal reference gene. values > <dig> reflect an up-regulation of gene expression whereas values < <dig> represent a down-regulation of expression in relation to the non-regulated internal reference, siga.

* statistically significant gene regulation 

within the first hour of nitrogen limitation, the transcription of both msmeg_ <dig> and msmeg_ <dig> was statistically significantly down-regulated by a relative factor of  <dig>  . the expression of msmeg_ <dig> did not alter significantly thereafter . the down-regulation of nadp+-gdh  observed in m. smegmatis is similar to the pattern of expression of the homologous gene  in a related actinomycete, streptomyces coelicolor, under analogous conditions  <cit> . the l_ <dig> class of nad+-gdh enzymes identified to date have been well characterised, however, the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes has not yet been investigated in any depth. under our experimental conditions, the l_ <dig> nad+-gdh in m. smegmatis  was down-regulated within the first hour of nitrogen starvation . however, after  <dig> hrs exposure to nitrogen starvation conditions, there was a statistically significant increase in msmeg_ <dig> transcription . the expression of the putative nad+-gdh gene, encoded by msmeg_ <dig>  was also analysed but by reverse transcriptase pcr. the pcr products were separated on a 1% agarose gel which were quantified using densitometric analysis of the gel image  <cit> . an msmeg_ <dig> mrna species was detected  which indicated that the gene was transcribed under our experimental conditions. in addition, from visual inspection of the gel image , msmeg_ <dig> appeared to be regulated in response to nitrogen availability. upon densitometric analysis, it was found that after an initial  <dig> fold decrease in gene expression  in response to nitrogen starvation, gene transcription appeared to be up-regulated after  <dig> hrs  exposure to these conditions.

transcriptional control of nitrogen-related genes in s. coelicolor is co-ordinated by an ompr-type regulator, glnr, which can act both as an activator and repressor of transcription  <cit> . a glnr-type regulator has been identified in m. smegmatis and has been shown to regulate a number of nitrogen-related genes in this organism <cit> . amon et al.  <cit>  were able to elucidate a glnr consensus dna binding sequence, however, this binding sequence could not be identified upstream of msmeg_ <dig>  <cit>  and has not been investigated with regards to msmeg_ <dig> or msmeg_ <dig>  the m. smegmatis genome also encodes for a putative tetr-type transcriptional repressor, amtr, which is responsible for the regulation of a number of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism in c. glutamicum  <cit> . the gene encoding for nadp+-gdh in c. glutamicum is up-regulated in response to nitrogen starvation, however, it was found that the transcription of this gene is highly variable and is controlled by a variety of regulators  <cit>  including amtr. it is possible that either of these regulators may be responsible for the regulation of msmeg_5442; msmeg_ <dig> and msmeg_ <dig> transcription in m. smegmatis, however, this remains to be investigated.

the observed transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding for nadp+-gdh  did not directly correlate with observations made at the level of gdh specific activity. an initial down-regulation of msmeg_ <dig> gene transcription was seen under conditions of nitrogen starvation , yet nadp+-gdh reaction activity increased . this result suggests that an additional regulatory mechanism may play a role in the control of total nadp+-gdh enzyme activity. a slightly different trend was observed for nad+-gdh under conditions of nitrogen starvation. the expression of msmeg_ <dig> and msmeg_ <dig> was repressed within the first hour of nitrogen starvation  which was reflected by an initial decrease in nad+-gdh specific activity. however, between  <dig>  hr and  <dig> hr nitrogen starvation, there was a significant increase in nad+-gdh specific activity in the absence of an increase in transcription of either msmeg_ <dig> or msmeg_ <dig> . after  <dig> hrs exposure to nitrogen starvation conditions, the expression of msmeg_ <dig> and msmeg_ <dig> increased significantly  which, once again, was mirrored by an increase in specific activity of nad+-gdh by approximately  <dig> u . these observations suggest that nad+-gdh activity may be regulated by both transcriptional control and an additional regulatory mechanism such as post-translational modification.

CONCLUSIONS
the production of glutamate and glutamine is critically important in all bacteria for the synthesis of essential cellular components. glutamate can be produced by either gogat or gdh and glutamine is produced by glutamine synthetase via the gs/gogat cycle. the large energy cost associated with the production of glutamate and glutamine by the gs/gogat system can be bypassed by the functioning of the gdh pathway  under conditions of nitrogen excess. conversely, under nitrogen limiting conditions, the gs/gogat cycle becomes the major nitrogen assimilatory route . our analysis of m. smegmatis gs found that both enzyme specific activity and glna <dig> transcription were regulated in response to nitrogen availability. gs specific activity was rapidly down-regulated under excess ammonium concentrations and conversely regulated when starved of ammonium. this rapid change in activity, in the absence of initial significant transcriptional regulation, could be attributed to post-translational control by glne. the large increase in glna <dig> transcription after a prolonged period of nitrogen starvation  could, together with post-translational regulation, be responsible for further increases in gs activity under those conditions. gs appeared to play a greater assimilatory role under conditions of nitrogen limitation than under conditions of nitrogen excess which is similar to observations made in other bacteria  <cit> .

under our experimental conditions, we observed that nadp+-gdh aminating activity did not alter significantly in response to nitrogen availability, in contrast to results obtained in related actinomycetes such as s. coelicolor  <cit>  or c. glutamicum  <cit> . it appeared as though nadp+-gdh in m. smegmatis had a constitutive ammonium assimilatory function under our experimental conditions. it was found, however, that the de-aminating activity of nadp+-gdh did change in response to nitrogen availability which suggests that the activity of nadp+-gdh in m. smegmatis is regulated in a manner different to other actinomycetes. it may be that an increase in glutamate catabolism under these conditions could produce free ammonia required for essential glutamine production by gs. the high levels of nad+-gdh aminating activity observed under all conditions of ammonium availability in m. smegmatis was unexpected as nad+-gdh enzymes are presumed to be largely involved in glutamate catabolism. in addition, nad+-gdh animating activity appeared to change in response to nitrogen availability which could indicate an important role in ammonium assimilation. in the absence of an initial upregulation of nad+-gdh gene transcription under conditions of ammonium starvation, the observed increase in nad+-gdh aminating activity might possibly be attributed to other control mechanisms, such as the gara-pkng regulatory system. this type of regulation may also account for the observed decrease in nad+-gdh aminating activity upon exposure to an ammonium pulse. transcription of msmeg_ <dig> and msmeg_ <dig> increased after prolonged exposure to nitrogen starvation , which similarly to gs, could contribute to the maintenance of elevated levels of activity under those conditions. an inherent limitation of this study is that cell free extracts were used in enzyme activity assays which may possibly contain enzymes/proteins other than the glutamate dehydrogenases that could utilize nadh as co-factors and therefore confound gdh assay results. however, since whole cell lysates have been utilized successfully in previous studies  <cit> , the possibility that the observed changes in enzyme activity are true physiological responses to nitrogen availability should not be disregarded.

from our results, it would appear that there are differences in the roles that the various gdh enzymes play in m. smegmatis and in other related organisms. there are also differences between the mycobacteria. the slow growing pathogenic mycobacteria such as m. tuberculosis and m. bovis do not appear to have an nadp+-gdh, however both genomes do encode for an nad+-gdh which share a 81% and 82% amino acid identity with msmeg_ <dig> respectively. the results obtained from our study imply that nad+-gdh may play a previously unpredicted and potentially important nitrogen assimilatory role in these pathogenic species. since nad+-gdh enzymes are able to assimilate nitrogen with a much lower associated energy cost than the gs/gogat system, it is possible that these enzymes may facilitate bacterial survival under conditions where energy preservation is vital, such as during latency. an investigation into the physiological roles of nad+-gdh enzyme in m. bovis is currently underway.
