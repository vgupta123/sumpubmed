BACKGROUND
bluetongue  is a non-contagious, arthropod-borne viral disease that affects ruminants  <cit> . bt was first recognised and described in south africa after the introduction of fine-wool sheep from europe over 200 years ago  <cit> . the classical form of bt is seen in sheep; however, cattle are also a natural reservoir for the virus  <cit> . the causative agent of bt is bluetongue virus , the type species of the genus orbivirus in the family reoviridae  <cit> . btv is mostly transmitted by adult females of the haematophagous midges that belong to the genus culicoides  <cit> .

since  <dig> btv has become one of the most widespread animal pathogens, as it has spread to areas that were previously free of the virus  <cit> . outbreaks of bt occur when susceptible sheep are introduced into btv-endemic regions or when the virus spreads to naïve sheep populations at the interface of endemic and non-endemic regions  <cit> . in  <dig> btv serotype  <dig>  was detected in northern europe ; this was the first time that btv had been detected beyond the latitude of  <dig> °n. in subsequent outbreaks the northernmost limits of btv moved beyond  <dig> °n  <cit> .

a number of vaccines have been developed against bt. these include inactivated whole virus vaccines, live attenuated virus vaccines , recombinant vaccines and virus-like particle  vaccines. while these vaccines have various advantages and disadvantages, only attenuated virus vaccines and some inactivated vaccines are presently commercially available . a vaccine produced by onderstepoort biological products  that consists of a mixture of attenuated field strains is widely used in south africa  <cit> . however, several side effects including the development of mild clinical symptoms  <cit> , decreased milk production  <cit>  and transplacental infection  <cit>  have been documented with the use of these vaccines. these factors have led to the development of recombinant btv vaccines. vlp vaccine candidates have been produced using insect cells and more recently, also plant-based expression systems, and were shown to be safe and effective, with vaccinated sheep protected against virus challenge . a disadvantage of these however, is that they are protective against only one of the  <dig> btv serotypes, unless they are administered as a combination of vlps produced against different serotypes, thereby increasing cost of the vaccines. furthermore, with the use of vlp vaccines, one is not able to distinguish infected from vaccinated animals  when using current commercially available diagnostic techniques which rely on the detection of the group specific antigen vp <dig>   <cit> . in south africa  <dig> of the  <dig> known btv serotypes have been detected in the country and it has been found that multiple btv serotypes co-circulate with each vector season  <cit> : this demonstrates the necessity for use of a multivalent vaccine for btv in this region.

the btv structural protein vp <dig> is the major serotype-specific antigen of btv  <cit> . it has been shown that ≥ 50 μg doses of vp <dig> obtained from both isolated and purified btv as well as recombinantly-produced vp <dig> induced neutralising antibodies protected some, but not all of the sheep that were vaccinated, against viral challenge  <cit> . even though these subunit vaccines have been shown to be safe for use in sheep  <cit> , it is desirable to enhance the breadth of immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates.

epitopes are localised regions on the surfaces of antigens that are involved in recognition by antibodies. these regions also have the ability to elicit an immune response and represent the smallest subunits that can be used therapeutically  <cit> . many advantages such as safety, ease of production and analytical control are associated with the use of epitope-based vaccines: with the presentation of specific epitopes a precise immune response can be directed at conserved and highly immunogenic regions of antigens of interest  <cit> . b-cell epitopes are parts of antigens that are recognised by the variable regions of antibodies  <cit> . several epitope-based vaccines have been developed for the treatment of various cancers and the prevention of infectious diseases. epitope-based vaccines for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma, end-stage cervical cancer and melanoma have been successful and have entered or completed phase i and ii clinical trials . furthermore, an epitope-based vaccine derived from the epstein-barr virus latency-related antigens has been shown to be immunogenic in pre-clinical trials in mice  <cit> .

the immunogenicity of proteins can be increased by fusion to other immunogenic proteins, such as the hepatitis b core protein  <cit> , by adding adjuvant to the vaccine formulation  <cit> , or by fusion to signal sequences that drive assembly and sequestration of the protein into protein bodies   <cit> . particulate proteins with repeating sequence motifs, such as pbs, are favoured for uptake by antigen presenting cells, thereby enhancing the immune response  <cit> .

pbs are endoplasmic reticulum -derived organelles found in maize seeds. these organelles stably store massive amounts of zeins as a source of protein within the er  <cit> . once expressed and targeted to the er for post translational modification, these zein polypeptides oligomerise in large complexes and eventually self-associate into pbs . the proline-rich n-terminal  of one of these zeins - γ-zein - was shown to be important for er retention and the formation of pbs in both maize seeds and a wide range of eukaryotic cells  <cit> .

zera®  is a synthetic peptide generated from the n-terminal proline-rich domain of γ-zein  <cit> . the zera® sequence consists of  <dig> amino acids that include the γ-zein signal peptide and the first  <dig> amino acids of γ-zein. the complete zera® sequence contains four regions: a γ-zein er-targeting signal peptide,  <dig> hydrophobic non-proline amino acids that contain a cgc motif that is important for packing of protein bodies due to the formation of inter-and intra-chain disulphide bonds, the proline-rich repeat domain containing eight repeats of the hexapeptide pppvhl which is important for the assembly of pbs and finally, a proline-x  sequence where proline residues alternate with other amino acids  <cit> . the main driving forces behind the self-assembly of pbs are hydrophobic interactions between the  <dig> repeat regions of two or more zera® chains and inter-chain disulphide bond formation that stabilises and strengthens the oligomers  <cit> .

zera® fused to several different proteins - including red fluorescent protein  <cit> , enhanced cyan fluorescent protein  <cit> , human growth hormone  <cit> , calcitonin  <cit>  and epidermal growth factor  <cit>  - has been shown to result in the formation of pbs in the leaves of both transiently and stably transformed tobacco plants. it has been shown that fusion of a hpv- <dig> shuffled e <dig> protein  to zera® enhanced immunogenicity of the protein; moreover, free protein bodies mixed with free e7sh protein also resulted in an enhanced immune response  <cit> . more recently, a study by hofbauer et al.  <cit>  showed that encapsulation of hemagglutinin in pbs resulted in stronger immune responses in mice when compared to responses obtained with soluble antigen.

the antigenic characteristics of btv vp <dig> make it an excellent candidate for a bt vaccine. by presenting vp <dig> to the immune system in particulate form, immunogenicity of the protein should be enhanced, and less of the antigen may be needed for vaccination. here we report on the development of two novel vp2-based btv vaccine candidates. for the first vaccine candidate, the putative antibody-binding epitopes of multiple serotypes of vp <dig> were predicted with in silico methods and a synthetic peptide based on the predicted epitopes was constructed. the second vaccine candidate consisted of the full-length plant codon-optimised btv- <dig> vp <dig>  nucleotide sequences representing both the synthetic epitope sequence and the full-length plant codon-optimised btv- <dig> vp <dig> were fused to the zera®-encoding sequence to drive pb formation when expressed in n. benthamiana. in situ tem analysis of infiltrated leaves was carried out to determine if the zera®-fused proteins accumulated into pbs. finally, a preliminary investigation was carried out to assess the immunogenicity of these fusion proteins in mice.

RESULTS
prediction of a putative btv vp <dig> epitope

in silico prediction of continuous b-cell epitopes was carried out on eight full-length vp <dig> amino acid sequences that were available on genbank at the time of the study  with cobepro  <cit>  prediction software available from the scratch protein server . the  <dig> vp <dig> amino acid sequences were aligned and two predicted b-cell epitope regions that were similar for most of the serotypes were selected for the epitope-based vaccine sequence, these epitope regions were not similar to the neutralisation regions  proposed by demaula et al.  <cit> . two predicted epitope regions  that showed consensus among most of the amino acid sequences were selected for the design of the putative epitope-based vaccine and a homologous region across all the serotypes was also included in the sequence . in total the putative predicted epitope-based oligomer  consisted of 54 bp that translated into  <dig> amino acids . no linkers were included between the putative epitope regions to facilitate folding as these were linear b-cell epitopes that would be folded into zera® pbs.fig.  <dig> construction of vp2ep. a selected regions of the multiple alignment of  <dig> selected btv vp <dig> serotype amino acid sequences are shown. the predicted epitope regions corresponding to most of the serotypes are shown below the alignment in bold and boxed in blue and green. the homologous region is boxed in purple. b the putative amino acid and nucleotide sequences of vp2ep




zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> expression in n. benthamiana
zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> were successfully cloned into peaq-ht  to generate peaq-htzera®-vp2ep  and peaq-htzera®-vp <dig>  and the recombinant constructs electroporated into agrobacterium tumefaciens lba <dig>  transient expression of zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> after agrobacterium-mediated infiltration of n. benthamiana leaves was investigated over a 7 day period, where leaf discs were harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 7 days post infiltration. plants were infiltrated at an od <dig> of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  with recombinant zera®-vp2ep or zera®-vp <dig> to examine the effects of a. tumefaciens cell concentration on recombinant protein expression levels. both proteins were detected on western blots, with predicted bands of zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> at ~16 kda and ~120 kda, respectively . zera®-vp2ep accumulation was observed on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  with peak accumulation observed at  <dig> dpi  when using an infiltration od <dig> of  <dig> . the infiltrated leaves showed chlorosis with slight necrosis at the infiltration sites at  <dig> dpi , after which the infiltrated leaves became more necrotic. when the cell concentration was increased to an od <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> , the plants showed severe necrosis with blackening and drying out of the leaves . in addition the increased cell concentration resulted in no expression of zera®-vp2ep at any of the days sampled post infiltration .fig.  <dig> expression of zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> in n. benthamiana. western blots of crude leaf extracts from leaves infiltrated with zera®-vp2ep  and zera®-vp <dig>  constructs at infiltration od <dig> values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively and harvested at  <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and 7 days post infiltration . expressed protein was detected with α-vp2r polyclonal antibody. samples from negative control plants  were infiltrated with infiltration medium only. red arrows indicate the position of the appropriately-sized expressed proteins. lanes m represent the molecular weight marker with sizes indicated in kda. c
n. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with different a. tumefaciens cell concentrations. leaves expressing zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> were photographed at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively




in contrast, expression of zera®-vp <dig> was only detected on western blots by using an infiltration od <dig> of  <dig>  . expression was observed from  <dig> dpi onward, with the highest levels detected at  <dig> dpi. the high infiltration od resulted in slight chlorosis of the leaves at  <dig> dpi , however it did not negatively affect expression of zera®-vp <dig>  even though the leaves infiltrated at lower cell concentrations  displayed chlorosis, no protein was detected on western blots .

in situ characterisation of pbs
having shown that optimal expression of zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> occurred at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi respectively, based on protein band intensity on western blots, we determined whether or not these polypeptides were sequestered into pbs as designed. it has been shown that the zera® domain containing the  <dig> repeats and the pro-x sequences allow for the accumulation of fusion proteins into membrane-bound pbs  <cit> . tem of embedded zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> leaf material at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively, showed the presence of membrane-defined, spherical electron-dense pb-like structures ranging from  <dig>  μm to 1 μm in size in the cytoplasm of leaves expressing zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> . these electron-dense structures were embedded in the cytoplasm. no structures resembling pbs were observed in any of the negative control samples that were viewed .fig.  <dig> transmission electron micrographs of protein bodies. leaf sections were infiltrated with a peaq-htzera®-vp2ep and b peaq-htzera®-vp <dig> and c infiltration medium as a negative control. pbs for both zera®-vp2ep  and zera®-vp <dig>  were present as electron-dense structures within the cytoplasm of the infiltrated leaves. no similar structures were present in the negative control samples . scale bars: a and b:  <dig>  μm; c:  <dig>  μm. cw: cell wall, cpt: chloroplast, cyt: cytoplasm, er: endoplasmic reticulum




purification of pbs
since it was shown that zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> successfully formed pb-like structures when expressed in n. benthamiana, the number of plants infiltrated was scaled up to purify pbs by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion. western blot analysis of the clarified crude protein extracts showed the presence of bands at ~16 kda for zera®-vp2ep  and ~120 kda for zera®-vp <dig> . the detection of an additional band at ~26 kda on the zera®-vp2ep western blot  could potentially represent dimerised fusions of zera®-vp2ep. no bands were detected in the crude extracts from negative control plants .fig.  <dig> purification of pbs. a western blot analysis of crude zera®-vp2ep  and zera®-vp <dig>  extracted protein using α-vp2r as primary antibody. white arrows indicate the respective proteins with the black arrow showing an oligomerised fusion of vp2ep. in both cases the negative control  was plant material infiltrated with infiltration medium only that was extracted using the same method. lanes m indicate the molecular weight marker in kda. b α-vp2r dot blots of  the negative control,  zera®-vp2ep and  zera®-vp <dig> purified using a 42% sucrose cushion




purification of the pbs using discontinuous sucrose gradients was not successful as western blot analysis of the fractions collected after ultracentrifugation showed the presence of zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> in all the fractions, with the bulk of protein detected in the pellet . this could be because of the variable sizes and therefore densities of the pbs, as well as the presence of soluble protein in the preparation. accordingly, crude zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> as well as negative control plant extracts were overlaid onto 42% sucrose cushions and centrifuged at  <dig>  <dig> × g to facilitate collection of the dense pbs in the pellet. after centrifugation, the supernatant on top of the sucrose cushion , the sucrose cushion itself  and the resuspended pellets  were analysed on dot blots probed with α-vp2r serum . fractions collected from the negative control showed no colour development in either the pellet, the 42% sucrose fraction or the top fraction . dot blots of zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> showed a positive reaction with the pellet sample, indicating successful pelleting of the recombinant pbs through the sucrose cushion ; no protein was detected in either the top or 42% sucrose fractions.

the purified pbs were found to be very stable as well as insoluble. dot blot analysis of pelleted zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> always showed the presence of oligomerised proteins in the denatured samples, even after treating the purified proteins at 90 °c with 500 mm dtt in order to denature them . it was further investigated whether the sequential extraction process described by joseph et al.  <cit>  would result in the solubilisation of the pbs. the first solubilisation step facilitates the extraction of soluble and membrane-bound proteins, after which the second step extracts proteins that are linked by disulphide bridges. the final heating step should theoretically result in solubilisation of the pb cores  <cit> . after treatment with sds and dtt, the pbs were always present in the final insoluble pellet . since the pbs were intended for immunogenic studies in mice, it was not desirable for the extraction buffers to contain reagents such as dtt or sds, as these might be detrimental to the health of the animals. therefore, the pellet obtained after ultracentrifugation was washed with buffer pbp <dig> containing 10% sucrose to stabilise the pbs and protein concentrations of zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> pbs were calculated to be ~  <dig>  mg and ~ 35 mg total protein per kilogram of fresh leaf material, respectively.

humoral immune response of pb vaccine candidates
in order to determine whether the purified pbs stimulate antibodies which are vp2-specific, mice were inoculated with the zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> pb candidate vaccines at 10 μg per dose and the humoral anti-vp <dig> immune responses analysed by indirect elisa, using e. coli-produced btv- <dig> vp <dig> fused to a trigger factor chaperone as coating antigen. initial analysis of the pre-and final bleed sera of the individual mice showed the presence of anti-vp <dig> antibodies in only the final bleed sera of mice vaccinated with both the zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> candidate vaccines, therefore mouse sera from each group were pooled  for analysis of the anti-vp <dig> binding titres. the antibody binding titres  are expressed as the reciprocal of the maximum serum dilution containing absorbance values that were three times greater than the corresponding pre-bleed serum at 1: <dig>  no anti-vp <dig> response was detected for the vaccine pre-bleeds  and the negative control vaccine . the positive control indirect elisa using sheep serum  showed an anti-vp <dig> response , thereby validating the indirect elisa used to determine anti-vp <dig> titres of the zera® vaccine candidates tested in this study.fig.  <dig> analysis of serum from immunised mice. a titration of the mouse antisera produced zera®-vp2ep , zera®-vp <dig>  and dpbs  vaccine candidates as well as titration of positive control sheep serum produced against btv- <dig> vlps  <cit>  to validate the indirect elisa . the markers indicate the mean value of triplicate samples from both animal experiments, and error bars indicate the standard deviation.  western blot detection of the e. coli-expressed vp <dig> fusion protein with 1: <dig> dilution of pooled mice sera from animals vaccinated with the zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> vaccines. lane m represents the molecular weight marker. the negative control  was performed with no primary antibody and sheep serum obtained from btv- <dig> vlp vaccinated sheep  <cit>  was used as the positive control . lanes pb and fb represent the pre-and final bleed sera respectively. the white arrow indicates the e. coli-expressed vp <dig> fusion protein at ~163 kda. pb – prebleed; fb – final bleed




the zera®-vp2ep vaccine elicited anti-vp <dig> titres of  <dig>  with an od <dig> of ~ <dig>   compared to an od <dig> of ~ <dig>  obtained for the corresponding pre-bleed serum. in addition, the zera®-vp <dig> vaccine candidate elicited anti-vp <dig> binding titres of  <dig> at an od <dig> of ~ <dig>  , compared to an od <dig> value of ~ <dig>  obtained for the corresponding pre-bleed serum. statistical analysis of the anti-vp <dig> responses elicited by the zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> vaccine candidates, showed that the antibody levels were significantly higher for both vaccines compared to the dpbs negative control .

the ability of the antibodies produced against zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> to recognise the btv- <dig> vp <dig> fusion protein was further analysed by evaluating mouse serum from mice inoculated with zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> vaccine candidates on western blots using the e. coli-produced btv- <dig> vp <dig> fusion protein as antigen. individual pre-and final bleed sera from both experiments were pooled for each vaccine candidate and analysed for anti-vp <dig> responses .

the e. coli-expressed vp <dig> fusion protein  was detected with the positive control sheep serum raised against plant-produced btv- <dig> vlps and the final bleed serum obtained from zera®-vp2ep- and zera®-vp2-vaccinated mice . non-specific protein bands smaller than the ~163 kda vp <dig> band were detected with all the serum samples, including the positive control. these bands possibly represent truncated versions of the e. coli-expressed vp <dig>  it has been shown that heterologous expression in e. coli often results in the expression of truncated versions of the expressed proteins due to abundant codons found in heterologous genes which cause translational stalling and termination of protein expression  <cit> . no non-specific protein bands were detected with the pre-bleed sera.

discussion
the incursion of btv- <dig> into northern europe in  <dig> resulted in significant economic losses due to the mortality of affected livestock, but more importantly due to the ban of ruminant trade between affected and non-affected regions  <cit> . in an effort to limit the direct losses incurred with btv infection and to minimize circulation of the virus, vaccination of livestock using four monovalent modified live virus vaccines obtained from south africa was undertaken by european countries  <cit> . many vaccine candidates have been developed against bt – with varying degrees of success  <cit> . recombinant vaccines are promising vaccine candidates as they have the potential to be safer than attenuated vaccines with no risk of reassortment, and they can be diva compliant  <cit> .

immunologically, vp <dig> is the most important btv protein , and inocula consisting of vp <dig> on its own or combined with vp <dig> have been tested as possible vaccine candidates, with variable results  <cit> . even though vp <dig> subunit vaccines provided protection at lower doses, no neutralising antibodies were detected after vaccination. it is therefore desirable to increase immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates; this could potentially be achieved by fusion of vp <dig> to zera® which results in formation of particulate proteins which are partly protected from extracellular enzymatic degradation. these particulate proteins indirectly or directly target antigen presenting cells  by either accessing the specific endosomal uptake function of apcs or by interaction with specific dendritic cells, thereby enhancing the immune response  <cit> . moreover, it has been postulated that the n-terminus of zera® potentially possesses intrinsic adjuvant activity, thereby further enhancing the immune response  <cit> .

in an effort to find alternative, possibly multivalent vaccine candidates for btv, we undertook to design and express two novel second-generation btv vaccines in n. benthamiana by means of agrobacterium-mediated transient recombinant protein expression. the first vaccine is based on synthetic b-cell epitopes predicted for multiple serotypes of vp <dig> by using online computational methods; the second vaccine is based on incorporation of the full length btv- <dig> vp <dig> only. by utilising the immunogenic properties of only vp <dig>  these vaccine candidates were aimed at being diva-compliant using current commercially available serological diagnostic tests which are dependent on detecting the presence of the group-specific antigen vp <dig>  <cit> .

the putative multi-epitope  and full length btv- <dig> vp <dig> were both fused to zera® to induce accumulation of the proteins in dense pbs called storpro® organelles . both zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> proteins were successfully expressed in plants, and it was shown using tem that both these constructs directed the accumulation of btv-specific proteins in electron-dense granules that were surrounded by a membrane, within the cytoplasm of plant cells. these structures were similar in size and morphology to epidermal growth factor pbs produced in sf <dig> insect cells  <cit> . two steps have been described for the formation of pbs:  early synthesized zera® fusion polypeptide chains promote self-assembly of zera®, resulting in the origin of pbs and thereafter  the continued synthesis of the fusion protein at later stages results in the pb growing by incorporating zera® fusions into the pbs that were formed during the early stages of expression  <cit> . the different sizes that were observed for the zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> pbs could be attributed to the occurrence of the two-step process described above.

we attempted to purify zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> pbs on discontinuous sucrose gradients. analysis of the fractions collected after ultracentrifugation showed that the proteins of interest were present in all the fractions, including the pellet. these results could be attributed to the different sizes and therefore densities of early and mature protein bodies. similar results were obtained by geli et al.  <cit>  after subcellular fractionation of transgenic plants expressing γ-zein. therefore, a 42% sucrose cushion was used instead to pellet the pbs in the plant extract, this made the pbs very easy to partially purify. the pelleted pbs were extremely stable and insoluble, even after treatment with sds, dtt and heat. the sequestration of proteins in pbs that are membrane-delimited has been shown to protect fusion proteins from proteolytic degradation  <cit> . the stability of the pbs is ideal for vaccines, as it means the vaccine candidates can be stored at 4 °c for extended periods of time without the risk of degradation or proteolysis.

both the zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> fusion proteins were successfully detected with rabbit serum raised against the full-length vp <dig> fusion protein. these results showed that antibodies in the sera were able to recognise and bind to the synthetic epitope, suggesting that regions encoding immunogenic epitopes were accurately selected for design of this vaccine candidate. these results are promising, as success of the epitope-based vaccine could obviate the need for vaccination with a mixture of multiple serotypes since it contains putative epitopes for at least eight btv serotypes.

preliminary tests to analyse the immunogenicity of the zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> candidate vaccines were carried out in mice. this proof of concept study showed that both the zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> candidate vaccines elicited significant anti-vp <dig> humoral immune responses when compared to the negative control. moreover, the reaction of the antibodies in both elisa and western blots means the antibodies elicited in vaccinated mice would bind native protein as well as denatured protein, meaning they have the potential to protect against infection. future experiments, such as neutralization assays and challenge experiments of immunized animals, have to be carried out in order to further characterize the immune response obtained with these vaccine candidates.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig>  two novel protein body vaccine candidates encoding the predicted putative b-cell epitopes of vp <dig> and full-length codon-optimised vp <dig> fused to zera® to make particulate vaccines were successful in eliciting anti-vp <dig> humoral immune responses in mice. these novel pb vaccine candidates have shown great potential in this proof of concept study for the use of btv vaccines, as they are quick and simple to produce, extremely stable and diva compliant, making them ideal as rapid response vaccines.
