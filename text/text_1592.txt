BACKGROUND
gene transcription and pre-mrna processing are two major processes in eukaryotic mrna biosynthesis. rna processing events were thought to follow transcription. however, studies in the past two decades have well established that the pre-mrna processing is highly co-transcriptional in vivo <cit> . pcf <dig>  is one of such proteins that couple pre-mrna processing with transcription  <cit> .

originally identified as a factor required for pre-mrna 3′-end processing and transcription termination  <cit> , pcf <dig> was also eventually found to play a role in transcription initiation, elongation and mrna export from nucleus to cytoplasm  <cit> . recent studies revealed additional roles of pcf <dig> in transcription termination of snrna, snorna and cryptic unstable transcripts  <cit> . the effects of pcf <dig> on transcription and pre-mrna processing are largely mediated by its interactions with rna polymerase ii c-terminal domain  and other polyadenylation factors  <cit> . disruption of these interactions led to altered transcription termination and decreased polyadenylation efficiency  <cit> . the interactions could be affected directly by the phosphorylation status of pol ii ctd and indirectly by cis-elements within pre-mrna, possibly through rna-binding factors   <cit> .

given the key role of pcf <dig> in coupling transcription termination and 3′end processing, it is not surprising that pcf <dig> also serves as a target for regulated transcription and pre-mrna processing. recent studies revealed its additional roles, direct and indirect, in regulated transcription initiation, elongation, termination and alternative processing of pre-mrna  <cit> .

pcfs <dig> is one of the arabidopsis orthologs of yeast and human pcf <dig>  <cit> . while similar to pcf <dig> in both its amino acid sequence and domain structures, pcfs <dig>  unlike its yeast or human counterpart, was not required for the viability of arabidopsis plants  <cit> . functional characterizations revealed the role of pcfs <dig> in arabidopsis development such as flowering time  <cit> . molecular characterizations suggested that the function of pcfs <dig> in flowering control was partially mediated by the alternative processing  of fca, a gene encoding a flowering time regulator  <cit> . however, the ap of fca could not fully account for the delayed flowering of pcfs <dig> mutants, nor was it responsible for the other developmental defects, suggesting that there must be gene other than fca being targeted by pcfs <dig>  <cit> . supporting this hypothesis were the hundreds of differentially expressed genes in the pcfs4- <dig> mutant revealed by genome-wide gene expression profiling  <cit> .

given that pcf <dig> was recruited to actively transcribed gene loci through interaction with pol ii ctd  <cit> , we hypothesize that pcfs <dig> may also physically interact with the loci of its direct targets. to test this hypothesis, we employed a chip-seq assay to identify pcfs <dig> enriched sites  within the arabidopsis genome. the results shed light on what genes were directly targeted and how pcfs <dig> might be recruited to the loci of those targets. gene ontology  analysis of the es-linked genes revealed enriched go terms that both explained the known developmental defects of pcfs <dig> mutants and suggested additional regulatory roles of pcfs <dig> in other biological processes.

RESULTS
pcfs <dig> functions in multiple aspects of arabidopsis development
previously, we have genetically and molecularly characterized the functions of pcfs <dig> in flowering time control. we found that the flowering delay of the pcfs <dig> mutants could be partially explained by the effects of pcfs <dig> on the alternative processing of fca pre-mrna  <cit> . in addition to its delayed flowering, pcfs <dig> mutants also showed other phenotypes including reduced vigor of their seedlings, altered leaf shape and inflorescence phyllotaxy . in the early seedling stage, mutant plants were significantly smaller than the wild type . leaf edges of pcfs4- <dig> were more curved down towards its abaxial side . the siliques of pcfs4- <dig> mutants formed a larger angle with its stem in contrast to that in wild type col . albeit all these defects, the mutant remained quite healthy throughout its whole life cycle in the standard growth conditions, suggesting that pcfs <dig> is not essential for the viability of the plants. supporting this conclusion is that the expression of pcfs <dig> is not ubiquitous, but instead, tissue-specific and developmentally regulated  <cit> . the non-essential nature of pcfs <dig> for plant viability and specific developmental defects of pcfs <dig> mutants support a hypothesis that pcfs <dig> might specifically target on a subset of genes.

pcfs <dig> interacts with arabidopsis pol ii ctd domain
in mammals and yeast, pcf <dig> is recruited to actively transcribed gene loci through its interaction with phosphorylated pol ii ctd domain  <cit> . the interaction plays a pivotal role in mediating the effects of pcf <dig> on both transcription and pre-mrna processing  <cit> . to examine whether pcfs <dig> interacts with arabidopsis pol ii ctd, we carried out a modified yeast two-hybrid assay   <cit> . in the assay, the bait contained the kin28-tethered arabidopsis pol ii ctd domain. kin <dig> is a protein kinase and tethering it with the ctd ensures that the ctd is phosphorylated  <cit> . the results of y2h assays indicated that pcfs <dig> did interact with the ctd-kin <dig>  and since no interaction was detectable when kin <dig> was mutated , we concluded that the interaction was dependent on the phosphorylation of the ctd. to rule out that the interaction might be attributed to kin <dig> portion of the fusion protein, the interaction between pcfs <dig> and kin <dig> alone was tested, with the result being that no interaction was detectable . taken together, these results indicated that pcfs <dig> did interact with phosphorylated pol ii ctd, further supporting the idea that pcfs <dig> might be recruited to the loci of its direct targets.

pcfs4-tap fusion protein was enriched on hundreds of genomic regions
to address if pcfs <dig> physically interact with its target genes and what these genes might be, we transformed the pcfs4- <dig> mutant with a transgene encoding pcfs4-tap  fusion protein. the transgene successfully complemented the mutant phenotypes and the expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by western blots using the peroxidase-conjugated anti-peroxidase antibody against the tap tag . we then performed a chip  using the same antibody following the formaldehyde cross-linking treatment of two-week old seedlings. the chip dna and the input dna were further sequenced using illumina sequencing platform.

the sequence reads  derived from illumina sequencing were first mapped to the arabidopsis genome using bowtie  <cit> . about  <dig> million and  <dig>  million of reads from chip and input samples, respectively, were successfully mapped to the genome. the mapped reads were further analyzed using cisgenome to identify the enrichment sites  that were over-represented in the sequence reads from the chip sample  <cit> . the input sample was used as a background control in this analysis.  <dig> es sites were identified with the following criteria: log <dig> fold change ≥ 5; p-value ≤  <dig> ; and the false discovery rate  =  <dig>  .

to verify the enrichment of pcfs4-tap on the identified es, we performed a real-time pcr  analysis following the chip for  <dig> randomly selected es sites, which cover the entire es list with p-value ranking from low to high . the results indicated that pcfs4-tap was indeed enriched on all tested es sites in the chip sample. the enrichment ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> fold, relative to the control sites . thus, the identified es were truly representing the pcfs4-tap enrichment sites within arabidopsis genome.

when the distribution of the es was examined, it was found that 80% of the es were located on intragenic regions . for the es on intergenic regions, the majority of them were located in the vicinity of genes. 95% of es were located either within genes or  <dig> kb up- or down-stream of the genes . thus, pcfs <dig> was preferentially located on the intragenic region, consistent with its potential role in regulating transcription and pre-mrna processing.

when the es distribution within the intragenic region was considered, 66% of the es were located within exons, while 15% of them were located within introns . of the es within exons, there are 5% within 5′utr; 81% within coding sequence region ; and 14% within 3′utr . thus, pcfs4-tap was predominantly enriched within cds region.

identification of common cis-elements
with the identified es, we reasoned that there could exist a unique, shared cis-element rendering these es to be specifically targeted by pcfs <dig>  either directly or indirectly . to explore the potential cis-element, we analyzed the sequences of these es using meme-chip program  <cit> . three sequence motifs with varied significance, ranging from  <dig> x10- <dig> to  <dig> x10- <dig>  were identified . motif  <dig> was  <dig> bp long and shared by  <dig> es sites; motif  <dig> was  <dig> bp long and shared by  <dig> es sites; and motif  <dig> was  <dig> bp long and shared by  <dig> es sites . however, not all es sites  were covered by the  <dig> motifs, suggesting additional motifs that could not be identified by this method.

go enrichment analysis of es-linked genes
to explore the biological significance of pcfs <dig> enrichments on the identified es, the es-linked genes were extracted and analyzed. an es-linked gene is defined as one that is closest to a given es or an es within  <dig> kb up-stream of the gene’s start codon and  <dig> kb down-stream of its stop codon.  <dig> such genes were identified, with a majority of them being linked with a single es  and  <dig> of them  linked with  <dig> es .

with the es-linked genes as inputs, go enrichment analyses were performed using genecodis  <cit> . the results revealed that multiple go terms were over-represented in the es-linked genes  . a similar set of enriched go terms was identified when the genes were analyzed using goeast, another go enrichment analysis tool   <cit> . among those go terms were “photomorphogenesis”, “embryo development ending in seed dormancy” and “negative regulation of flower development”, which are consistent with the known altered morphologies and delayed flowering of pcfs4- <dig> mutants . the other enriched go terms include circadian rhythm, gametophyte development, protein kinase activity, plant cell wall synthesis, and response to fungus, suggesting potential roles of pcfs <dig> in additional biological processes . these results implied that pcfs <dig> might serve as an important regulator of transcription and pre-mrna processing for genes involved in a variety of biological functions in plants.

pcfs <dig> plays a role in arabidopsis circadian rhythm
to find further supporting evidence for the implied roles of pcfs <dig> in “additional” biological processes, we focused on the genes within the enriched go term “regulation of circadian rhythm”. the go term contains  <dig> es-linked genes . the enrichment of pcfs <dig> on these loci was verified by qpcr . since pcfs <dig> was an ortholog of pcf <dig> and known to play a role in alternative pre-mrna processing  <cit> , we examined the alternative processing profiles of these genes using publically available cdna/est data . indeed, all five genes showed certain forms of alternative transcription and/or pre-mrna processing evidenced by the cdna and/or est data . most importantly, the es sites on these genes were often associated with the positions where the alternative processing or alternative transcription initiation occurred .

we further tested the effects of pcfs <dig> mutation on circadian rhythm in arabidopsis by quantifying the expression of toc <dig> and cca <dig>  two key circadian clock genes  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  both the amplitude and circadian period were altered for the expression of toc <dig> and cca <dig>  with the pcfs <dig> mutant showing a lengthened circadian period and increased amplitude for both genes. thus, pcfs <dig> indeed played a role in arabidopsis circadian rhythm, likely through direct and indirect regulation of the transcription and/or pre-mrna processing of its target genes.

discussion
accumulating evidence in all three kingdoms of eukaryotic organisms supports the idea that alternative processing of pre-mrna plays a key role in regulation of gene expression and the transcriptome complexity  <cit> . among the many factors affecting ap of pre-mrna, one is pcf <dig>  while essential for pre-mrna 3′ end processing and transcription termination in general, there was evidence that pcf <dig> played a regulatory role in the pre-mrna processing of some genes  <cit> . being one of arabidopsis orthologs of pcf <dig>  pcfs <dig> was of special interest in that it is, unlike pcf <dig>  not essential for the plant viability  <cit> . the non-essential nature and the pleiotropic effects of pcfs <dig>  together with its proved regulatory role in fca pre-mrna processing, argue that pcfs <dig> may have specifically adapted itself for regulated pre-mrna processing of a subset of genes in plants. however, how pcfs <dig>  like pcf <dig> when playing a regulatory role, gains its specificity remains elusive.

the interaction of pcfs <dig> with pol ii ctd provides evidence that pcfs <dig> was recruited to actively transcribed gene loci . this interaction, on the other hand, does not define the target genes by pcfs <dig> since pol ii ctd is universally required for all actively transcribed protein-coding genes. towards understanding how pcfs <dig> might gain its target specificity, we identified the genome-wide pcfs4-tap es sites that were specifically concentrated on the genic regions . bioinformatic analysis identified a few unique sequence motifs that were shared by some of the es sites . these sequence motifs could be essential elements providing pcfs <dig> target specificity either as cis-elements within genes or pre-mrnas. so, how are the cis-element-containing genes specifically targeted by pcfs4? one scenario could be that the cis-elements within the pre-mrna compete with pol ii ctd for binding pcfs <dig> so that the interaction between pcfs <dig> and ctd is disrupted, leading to an altered pre-mrna processing. evidence supporting this scenario is the weak rna binding activity of pcf <dig> and the competitive pcf11-binding between rna and pol ii ctd  <cit> . alternatively, the cis-elements within the gene may affect the phosphorylation status of pol ii ctd, leading to gene-specific ctd code, which again may influence the ctd-pcfs <dig> interaction  <cit> .

the predominant location of es on the cds region was surprising, given that pcf <dig> in yeast was preferentially mapped to the 3′ end of the gene loci  <cit> . however, this discrepancy might well explain the non-essential nature of pcfs <dig>  in other words, pcfs <dig> may mainly play a regulatory role for transcription and pre-mrna processing of a subset of genes while its yeast ortholog, pcf <dig>  acts mainly as a general transcription termination and 3′end pre-mrna processing factor  <cit> .

the go enrichment analysis of es-linked genes revealed the functions of pcfs <dig> beyond what we have known previously. not only were the enriched go terms consistent with pcfs4′s functions in arabidopsis development and flowering control but also revealed its potential roles in circadian rhythm, response to fungus pathogen and plant cell wall synthesis . we were also able to verify pcfs4′s effects on arabidopsis circadian rhythm and the coincidence of pcfs <dig> es sites with the sites where the alternative processing was suggested by cdnas and/or ests. this shined light on how pcfs <dig> functions in this biological process. interestingly, recent studies also revealed a significant role of pre-mrna alternative processing in regulating the expression of circadian clock genes  <cit> . our discovery offers additional evidence of such a regulation.

these results, together with what have been known about pcfs <dig> and pcf <dig>  lead to a conceivable model by which the biological functions of pcfs <dig> might be explained. in this model, pcfs <dig> is recruited to the loci of subsets of genes. each subset of genes, whose regulated expression mediates a specific biological effect of pcfs <dig>  shares a common cis-element. the cis-element, when existing in pre-mrna, may affect the pcfs4-ctd interaction by competitively binding pcfs <dig> with ctd, or by recruiting another pcfs4-binding factor  <cit> . alternatively, when present on the gene, the cis-element may recruit factors affecting the phophorylation status of pol ii ctd domain  <cit> . by either way, the pcfs4-ctd interaction will be affected, leading to altered gene transcription and/or pre-mrna processing. depending on the functional nature of each subset of genes, the cis-element and its relative locations on the genes  could vary. the protein factors mediating the cis-element’s function may be unique for each subset of genes. the combination of the cis-elements, their locations and the mediating factors may explain the multiple biological effects of pcfs <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
it is demonstrated that arabidopsis pcfs <dig> specifically targets subsets of genes. its targeting specificity is likely mediated by the cis-element shared by the genes of each subset. the potential regulation at the level of transcription and mrna processing may be the basis for its multi functions in different aspects of arabidopsis development and environmental responses. the targeting specificity of arabidopsis pcfs <dig> might also suggest a potential mechanism of human and yeast pcf <dig> in regulating gene transcription and mrna processing.
