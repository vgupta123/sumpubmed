BACKGROUND
helitrons are a class of transposons which are unique in their proposed rolling-circle mode of replication mediated either autonomously by an internally coded putative dna replication-initiator-helicase protein, or non-autonomously. they have been identified in a number of species of plants, animals and fungi and can have a highly variable copy-number, from an infrequent representation in many mammals to contributing up to 5% of the genome size in some drosophila species . they show considerable size variation  and, unusually, helitron transposition does not give rise to duplication of target sites. helitrons insert within 5'-a↓t-3' target sites within the genome and can be recognised by conserved 5'-tc.. and ..ctrr-3' termini with, typically, 16– <dig> bp hairpin motifs 8– <dig> bp from the 3' termini.

a feature of helitron transposons is their ability to incorporate multiple genomic gene fragments which can still show transcriptional activity – thus creating the potential for novel truncated, alternatively spliced and chimeric mrnas and proteins  <cit> . the mechanism by which helitrons incorporate gene fragments is not clear, though it is presumably associated with mutation or misidentification of recognition sites during the replication process, and models which describe the acquisition of gene fragments both at the 5' and at the 3' end have been proposed  <cit> . in rice, arabidopsis and maize, the extensive genome resources have facilitated in silico identification of helitrons in these and related genera  <cit> . helitrons identified in maize  <cit>  and ipomoea tricolor  <cit>  have generated particular interest due to their proposed actions in creating haplotypic diversity and influencing gene function.

lolium perenne  and festuca pratensis  are members of the 'lolium/festuca complex' of interfertile grasses which form the basis of many grassland agricultural and amenity systems in temperate areas of the world. they belong to the pooideae sub-family of the poaceae, along with the triticeae cereal crops and brachypodium distachyon, the rapidly developing model for monocot species. the haploid genome sizes of l. perenne and f. pratensis are estimated to be c.  <dig> gb  <cit> , less than half the size of barley and the constituent genomes of hexaploid wheat  <cit>  but c. 6– <dig> times the size of b. distachyon and rice  <cit> . consequently, the intermediate genome sizes of l. perenne and f. pratensis between b. distachyon and the triticeae cereals and the close evolutionary interrelationships of these pooideae species, makes the lolium/festuca grasses of great interest in terms of understanding the processes which influence the evolution of genome organisation and size in close relatives.

gigantea  was originally identified as a key gene in the perception of circadian rhythms and the photoperiodic control of flowering by mutation analysis in arabidopsis  <cit> but it is only recently that detailed knowledge of the mode of action and interaction of this gene has become available  <cit> . comparative genome analysis between dicots and monocots has indicated that orthologues of many of the key genes involved in flowering in arabidopsis also exist in rice and other monocots  <cit>  and experimental evidence indicates that similar control mechanisms may be involved in some cases  <cit>  including for gi  <cit> . consequently, the identification of the orthologues of gi in l. perenne and other monocot crop species has been a desirable goal, partly to ascertain if it is implicated in flowering control in current breeding populations through qtl/genetic mapping studies but also to identify allelic variants which may be useful in future population development.

in this study we describe how, in the process of cloning the l. perenne orthologue of gi from a bac library, we identified gi pseudogene fragments associated with helitron-type sequences. similar sequences were found to be also present in the f. pratensis genome. additionally, we describe the use of a methylation-filtered l. perenne genomic library in an initial survey to ascertain the potential frequency of helitrons within the l. perenne genome.

RESULTS
identification of gi and gi pseudogene sequences from l. perenne and f. pratensis bac libraries
a primer pair, gig <dig> f/7r  was designed based on conserved regions spanning the first and fourth exons in existing gi sequences from other monocot species. this primer pair was tested on a range of genotypes from a l. perenne mapping family  and two distinct, non-segregating bands of  <dig> and  <dig> bp were amplified. sequencing of these pcr products indicated the  <dig> bp was likely to be a fragment of the expected gi gene, whereas the  <dig> bp band consisted of an apparent gi pseudogene fragment. pcr screening of an l. perenne bac library  with a second primer pair, giggt2f/2r, designed directly upon derived l. perenne genomic sequence, estimated between  <dig> and  <dig> giggt2f/2r priming sites per genome . four giggt2f/2r-positive bac clones were isolated from the library; one contained gigantea  and  <dig> contained apparently non-allelic gi pseudogene fragments . primer pair giggt2f/2r was also screened on the  <dig>  genome equivalent f. pratensis bac library and, again, an estimate of 4– <dig> priming sites per genome was obtained . however, the pcr products amplified from the f. pratensis bac library were of two distinct types, one type in the expected range and the other type smaller than expected. this latter type was subsequently confirmed by sequencing to be a truncated version of the gi pseudogene.

1thermal cycling profile for all primer pairs was as follows:  <dig> minute at 94°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> min at 94°c,  <dig> min at 60°c ,  <dig> min at 72°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> min at 94°c,  <dig> min at 50°c,  <dig> min at 72°c

both bac libraries were also screened with the gi specific primer pair giggt1f/1r. and the assay results estimated 1– <dig> copies per genome for the l. perenne library and  <dig> copy per genome for the f. pratensis library . all the bac library dna screening pools identified by primer pair giggt1f/1r in both libraries were also identified by primer pair giggt2f/2r, indicating that both lp/fpgi and lp/fp-psgi sequences were amplified by the latter primer pair.

lpgi sequence analysis
the region of one the bacs containing the lpgi gene  was sequenced directly and the genomic region containing lpgi identified. the gene structure was predicted with fgenesh+, using an existing l. perenne gi protein sequence  as template and spanned  <dig> bp from initiator to terminator codons. fourteen exons coded for a protein of 1148aa which showed 99% homology with the existing l. perenne gi protein sequence  and 92%, 91% 88% and 66% with homologous gi sequences from barley , wheat  rice  and arabidopsis , respectively . lpgi was mapped to chromosome  <dig> of a l. perenne mapping family to a position compatible with the known syntenic relationship between l. perenne chromosome  <dig> and rice chromosome  <dig> .

helitron-like sequences in lp-psgi.1–3
between c.  <dig> and  <dig> kb of the  <dig> bacs containing the different lp-psgi fragments  were sequenced directly from the bac. alignment of these sequences identified regions of partial homology between lp-psgi. <dig> and lp-psgi. <dig> of c.  <dig> kb and between lp-psgi.1/. <dig> and lp-psgi. <dig> of c.  <dig>  kb. insertions of c.  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb interrupted the homologous regions in lp-psgi. <dig> and lp-psgi. <dig>  respectively. the 3' end of the homologous regions were terminated in all the lp-psgi sequences by conserved regions containing a  <dig> bp motif  capable of forming a hairpin structure – characteristic of the 3' termini of helitron-like transposons .

blast comparisons of the lp-psgi sequences against the l. perenne genethresher®  library identified  <dig> individual lpgt sequences with homology to lp-psgi. <dig> both at the 5' and 3' ends, with the homology interrupted by a  <dig> fragment inserted into a potential helitron 5'-a↓t-3' target motif . the borders of the  <dig> bp insert consisted of a 5'-tc and 3'  <dig> bp conserved hairpin and ctag motifs, consistent with known helitron structures . no evidence of a potential dna replication-initiator-helicase protein coding sequence was identified within the  <dig> bp fragment, indicating that it was likely to represent a non-autonomous helitron. no lpgt sequences could be identified which spanned potential intact helitrons in lp-psgi. <dig> or lp-psgi. <dig>  indicating that the 5' regions of these putative helitrons may have been displaced. however,  <dig> different lpgt sequences were identified with homology beginning immediately beyond the conserved ctag 3' helitron terminus of lp-psgi. <dig>  in both these lpgt fragments the homologous regions began at a potential 5'-a↓t-3' helitron insertion site . three further lpgt sequences were identified with partial homology to the same internal region of lp-psgi. <dig>  in each of these fragments, the homology ended at potential 5'-a↓t-3' helitron insertion sites . this may represent the border of a smaller ancestral helitron, which subsequently expanded in the 5' direction.

gene fragments within the lp-psgi helitron sequences
within all the lp-psgi sequences, the lpgi-like fragment consisted of a continuous region of c.  <dig>  kb from  <dig> bases 5' of the atg initiation codon to  <dig> bases into the fifth exon . clustal alignments of the 3lp-psgi sequences with lpgi over the c. <dig>  kb conserved region indicated different degrees of sequence conservation in exon- and intron-derived regions. excluding base insertions and deletions, lpgi showed 83–86% sequence conservation with the lp-psgi sequences within the exonic regions but this dropped to 72–73% within the intronic regions. within the  <dig> lp-psgi sequences the ranges of sequence conservation within 'exonic' and 'intronic' regions were 94–98% and 95–97%, respectively .

 <dig> sequence similarity based on alignments of the complete sequences

additional gene fragments were identified 5' of the gi conserved region. a ribosomal protein s <dig> fragment was present approximately  <dig> kb upstream of gi in all of the lp-psgi sequences while a succinate dehydrogenase  fragment was found close to the 5' end of the helitron in lp-psgi. <dig> alone. both of these fragments contained exon and intron sequences. a  <dig>  kb insert specific to lp-psgi. <dig> was found to contain a fragment of a non-ltr retroelement, including a partial reverse transcriptase reading frame, which most likely results from a retrotransposition event unrelated to helitron activity  .

comparison of psgi sequences from l. perenne and f. pratensis
three different psgi-type sequences  were cloned from the f. pratensis bac library on the basis of identification with primer pair giggt2f/2r. comparison of these with the lp-psgi sequences showed that one, fp-psg <dig> , represented a helitron remnant sequence which was highly similar to the lp-psgi sequences, indicating a likely similar origin . fp-psgi. <dig> contained a similar 3' terminus to the lp-psgi sequences and the same sdh fragment near its 5' terminus . however, fp-gi. <dig> and . <dig> were noticeably different. fp-psgi.2; they contained a gi fragment slightly longer than that found in the lp-psgi sequences, extending more or less continuously from  <dig> bp 5' of the atg initiation codon to  <dig> bp before the end of the 5th exon, with subsequent partial homology up to the beginning of the 6th exon . the gi fragment in fp-psgi. <dig> was similar to that in fp-gi. <dig>  except that it contained a  <dig> bp deletion covering the 3rd and 4th exons of the gi fragment. this truncated gi fragment corresponded to the smaller pcr product obtained in some of the dna pools from the f. pratensis bac library screened with giggt2f/2r. in total, fp-psgi. <dig> and . <dig> shared sequence homology, interrupted by two major deletions in fp-gi. <dig>  over c.  <dig>  kb region of fp-gi. <dig> but showed no apparent homology with either fp-psgi. <dig> or the lp-psgi sequences outside of the gi region.

the conservations of exon- and intron-derived sequences within the gi fragment in fp-gi. <dig> in comparison to gi were 92% and 78%, respectively, indicating slightly greater conservation of exon and intron sequence than was observed for the lp-psgi sequences ; table 1). the equivalent figures for fp-psgi. <dig> in relation to the lp-psgi sequences were 79–81% for exons and 71–73% for introns.

identification of additional conserved hairpin motif-like sequences in the lpgt library
seedtop searches of the lpgt library identified  <dig> out of  <dig> patterns with >  <dig> lpgt sequence alignments. examination of these identified  <dig> possible helitron hairpin types . the most common type, represented  <dig> times in the lpgt library , was the 5'-gtgcgccaaggcgcac-3' 'type 1' motif present in the lp-psgi sequences. in addition to the  <dig> bp hairpin and the ctag↓t terminal motifs, the  <dig> bases 5' of the hairpin and the  <dig> bases between the hairpin and the ctag↓t were also strongly conserved. there was no apparent homology between any of the  <dig> sequences 3' of the ctag↓t and only limited homology 5' of the hairpin which was probably due to the at rich nature of this sequence. between the different hairpin types, the length of the hairpin sequence varied from between predominantly  <dig> bp  to predominantly  <dig> or  <dig> bp  with  <dig> to  <dig>  but usually  <dig> non-complementary bases separating the 7– <dig> mer complementary sequence stretches. the hairpin was separated from the ctag↓t motif by  <dig> to  <dig> bases for all hairpin types identified.

discussion
the discovery of the helitron families of transposons in plant species over the last few years has largely been a consequence of the availability of comprehensive genome sequence for the models rice and arabidopsis, and latterly for maize. the significance of this has been demonstrated by recent analyses in maize, which have shown the potential of helitron transposition for generating haplotypic diversity and disrupting gene function  <cit> . there are still few reports of helitron-like transposons in the pooideae grasses, a sub-family that includes the triticeae cereals and the poeae forage and amenity grasses, probably as a consequence of a necessary focus on transcriptome-based sequencing within these medium and large genome species. consequently, the extent to which helitrons are present in, or may have had a role in modelling these genomes is at the moment unknown . therefore, the identification of a putatively complete, non-autonomous helitron sequence as well as a number of partial helitron-like sequences in the species l. perenne and f. pratensis is important in confirming that helitron activity may have played a significant role in genome modelling within the pooideae.

the complete non-autonomous helitron sequence, lp-psgi. <dig>  is not dissimilar to helitron-type transposons from other plant species, in that it has the expected 5'- tc and 3' hairpin and ctrr terminal motifs as well as showing apparent transposition into an at target sequence . additionally, again as with similar helitron sequences, there is evidence that gene fragments have been captured within the helitron, in the present case fragments from a succinate dehydrogenase gene, a ribosomal protein gene and a fragment derived from the gene gi . the partial helitron sequences lp-psgi. <dig>  lp-psgi. <dig> and fp-psgi. <dig> show a highly similar internal structure to lp-psgi. <dig> towards the 3' end and so were, presumably, derived by transposition of the same ancestral helitron before the divergence of the lolium and festuca genomes; for lp-psgi. <dig> and lp-psgi. <dig>  the fact that there is little homology between the  <dig> sequences beyond the 3' and 5' termini would indicate that they represent separate transposition events, as opposed to haplotypic variants. whether lp-psgi.2/. <dig> and fp-psgi. <dig> represent partial sequences of complete helitrons or the complete sequences of helitron remnants has not yet been established.

there is no clear relationship between the helitron associated gi sequences  and the two independent fragments . the latter are relatively more closely related to the intact lpgi gene, with the helitron fragments being significantly diverged both from lpgi and the available triticeae sequences. gi is a single copy gene in rice and only a single gi copy exists in the current brachypodium genome draft, but two divergent and unlinked gi loci have recently been described in maize  <cit> . the ryegrass and fescue gi fragments may therefore be remnants of similar ancestral duplications in the temperate grass genomes, whose intact descendants have been lost. it is surprising, however, that two apparently different gi lineages should both have become extinct leaving similar sized fragments preserved simultaneously in at least one genome , particularly if helitron activity was responsible for one fragmentation but not the other.

we considered whether capture by a helitron may have accelerated the divergence of the lp-psgi.1/.2/. <dig> and fp-psgi. <dig> lineage from a fp-psgi.2/. <dig> fragment progenitor but this seems unlikely for at least two reasons. firstly, comparing the divergence between the helitron gi sequences indicates that they have acquired a relatively large number of indels since their origin from a common ancestor, but that the number of point mutations is not remarkable  and, so, the lp-gi sequences could not be assigned a genetic position.

the process by which helitrons capture foreign sequences has yet to be clarified and either 'read-through' errors at the 3' terminus or a mechanism based upon non-homologous repair of double-stranded dna breaks have been suggested  <cit> . comparison of the lp-psgi and gi sequences identified here provides some suggestion that the original capture of the gi fragment may have occurred by helitron expansion at the 5' end, a possibility referred to by  <cit> . alignment of the lp-psgi fragments with the equivalent gi gene sequence shows that the 3' border terminates with a potential a↓t helitron insertion site . it is therefore possible that helitron insertion originally occurred within this site in gi and upon subsequent transposition there was 'slippage' of the 5' helitron border resulting in incorporation of a fragment of gi. a similar mechanism is a possibility for the incorporation into lp-psgi. <dig> of a sequence homologous to lpgt fragments a, b, and c, as illustrated in fig.  <dig> 

there remains the major question as to how ubiquitous helitrons are in the l. perenne and other pooideae- genomes – a question that will only be definitively answered by the accumulation of contiguous genomic sequence for these species. however, the lpgt library does represent a collection of hypomethylated, presumed gene-rich  <cit>  though relatively short  genomic sequences. this size-range limitation means that they are unlikely to contain complete helitrons, but could contain recognisable helitron 3'-border motifs. searches of the lpgt library for short sequence stretches containing potential hairpins and the ctrr 3' helitron border motif identified  <dig> sets of sequences . if these do represent true 3' helitron borders, this indicates that helitron activity in l. perenne may have been relatively widespread in recent evolutionary history, as evidenced by the presence of these sequences in presumed hypomethylated regions of the genome  and by the sequence conservation across the hairpin types identified. the seedtop search identified  <dig> non-homologous sequences containing potential 3' helitron termini. however, it should be born in mind that this is very limited survey of the l. perenne genome, identification relying on: a) representation within cloned, hypomethylated regions, b) the 3' helitron motifs conforming to the seedtop search parameters  and c) >  <dig> copies of the same helitron type being present in the original search. therefore, if these do represent real 3' helitron borders, the actual number of helitrons in the l. perenne genome may be considerable. this being the case, as comprehensive genome sequence becomes available for l. perenne and the various pooideae species, it will be interesting to see the extent to which helitron activity may have been responsible for modifying and diversifying these grass and cereal genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
an apparently complete non-autonomous helitron and a related series of incomplete helitron sequences have been identified in the pooideae grasses lolium perenne and festuca pratensis. the identified helitrons had captured a number of gene fragments, including a fragment of the key flowering gene gigantea. searches of a l. perenne genethresher® dna sequence library identified a number of possible 3' helitron borders in unrelated sequences. this represents evidence for a possible ancestral role for helitrons in modelling the genomes of lolium and related species.
