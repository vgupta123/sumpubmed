BACKGROUND
abiotic and biotic stress is one of the major environmental factors limiting crop productivity worldwide. water deficiency is one of the primary causes for the reduction in crop yield  <cit> . previously, several studies shows that calcium, a key messenger, involved in several signalling pathways and regulates many growth and developmental processes, plays a crucial role in stress signalling and adaptation  <cit>  and in response to various biotic  and abiotic stresses such as light, uv light, high and low temperature, salt, drought, osmotic stress, mechanical stimuli including touch and wind, oxidative stress, ozone, and hypoxia  <cit> . within cells, calcium signatures are perceived by the ef-hand families of calcium-modulated proteins  which are well characterised in plants  <cit> . when intracellular calcium rises to about 1 μm, calmodulin  binds calcium, undergoes a change in conformation, and activates the target gene thereby producing the respective cellular response  <cit> . to elucidate the mechanisms underlying calcium/calmodulin regulated gene expression in plants, previous reports identified a family of six arabidopsis genes encoding calmodulin binding transcription activators   <cit>  also referred to as signal-responsive  protein  <cit>  or ethylene-induced cam binding proteins   <cit> . this factor, designated atcamta , is highly conserved and contains a cg- <dig> homology dna-binding domain at the n terminus , a tig domain , three ankyrin repeats  and five putative cam-binding motifs called as iq motif  <cit> . in arabidopsis, there are six camtas , whose transcript accumulates  or diminish  rapidly and transiently to various abiotic and biotic stress. each member has distinct or overlapping spatial and temporal expression pattern in different plant developmental stages under various biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . the first evidence of biological and physiological function of camta protein was recently reported in arabidopsis camta <dig>  loss of function mutant through a reverse genetic approach  <cit> . camta 3- knockout plants during developmental stages accumulates high level of reactive oxygen species , showed enhanced resistance towards fungal and bacterial pathogen by suppressing plant responses. it negatively regulates the defence response to pathogens and interacts with wrky <dig> tf in camta <dig> mutants  <cit> . similarly another study by galon y. et al.,  <dig> on camta <dig> reports the increased sensitivity for auxin in camta <dig> mutant suggesting a role in suppressing the plant responses to auxin when induced under stress condition  <cit> . there is considerable information about the changes in gene expression regulated by camta  <dig> under various stresses like cold, salt, heat and ultra-voilet  <cit> . the promoters of drought responsive element binding protein 1c  and zat <dig> binds with camta <dig> in plants  <cit>  indicating a calcium-signal driven gene expression. besides various findings on function of camta protein on stress physiology,  <cit>  were first to report down-stream gene of the camta protein and showed pollen-specific expression of atcamta <dig> and atcamta <dig> which possibly increased arabidopsis vppase  gene expression in pollen by binding to the pollen-specific cis-acting region of avp <dig> . the dna cis-element that binds to camta was identified as cgcg and cgtg binding motif in arabidopsis, atcamta <dig>  <cit>  and rice, os-cbt  <cit> . the consensus sequence of cgcg core motif is cgcg, giving the name to the dna binding domain of the protein as cg- <dig>  a novel cis-element which was first isolated from the parsley cdna library  <cit> . the consensus sequence of cgtg core motif is cgtgt and includes classical abscisic acid responsive element  motif , which is recognised by bzip proteins  <cit> . the most recent report on camta  in tomato revealed its role in fruit development and ripening  <cit> , they cloned seven slsr genes and their expression levels were differentially regulated mainly by development signals, as well as by ethylene and suggested that slsrs were located downstream of the rin-regulated network. on taking these results together, camta have the potential of relaying calcium signalling via calmodulin binding domain and stress signalling via cg- <dig> and abre binding motif.

the aim of our research is to study and characterise the molecular function of camta <dig> gene under drought condition and establish a possible role of camta <dig> protein in drought stress. the present study provides considerable information about the changes in gene expression, metabolic pathways, cgtg and cgcg motif dependent gene expression in camta <dig> under drought stress. in brief, we hypothesized camta <dig> to be essential for successful drought recovery.

RESULTS
the knockout camta <dig> showed drought sensitivity, poor wue and decline in rwc
camta has been reported to play an important role in abiotic stresses in plants especially cold  <cit> , however the role of camta in drought stress was not understood. thus, to explore and characterise the possible role of camta family of arabidopsis in drought, we obtained homozygous t-dna insertion lines of all camtas viz., camta1- <dig>  from arabidopsis biological resource centre  . initially we screened camta mutants by exposing them to various concentrations of mannitol for osmotic stress and their primary root elongation was observed and compared with the col- <dig> seedlings . in control condition, growth rate of all the camta were similar to the col- <dig> showing no apparent effect on plants caused by the silencing of the camta gene in the mutant. with the increase in mannitol concentration to 300 mm, apart from camta <dig>  no significant difference in root growth was observed through camta <dig> to camta <dig> when compared to col- <dig> . further, to distinguish the effect of osmotic stress on camta <dig>  seedlings of col- <dig> and camta1- <dig> were allowed to grow vertically on mannitol and peg  concentration series and their shoot weight  and primary root length  were estimated . at 100 mm mannitol and  <dig> % peg, there was no apparent visible phenotypic difference in col- <dig> and camta1- <dig> growth and their roots architecture . at 250 mm mannitol solution, both col- <dig>  and camta1- <dig>  had stunted growth, particularly camta1- <dig> showed higher growth retardation as a sign of growing under the stressed condition . subsequently, on increasing mannitol concentration to 300 mm, the growth of camta1- <dig>  was most severely affected with stunted primary root growth and shoot weight as compared to col- <dig> . similarly, peg induced osmotic stress showed similar affect on camta1- <dig> growth and root development . at  <dig> % peg, large difference was observed in root and seedling growth of camta1- <dig>  as compared to col- <dig> . the peg-induced  reduction in growth and primary root length was much pronounced in camta1- <dig>  than col- <dig>  . the statistically significant changes have been marked with an asterisk  in respective figure . error bars indicates standard deviation sd  and asterisk indicates significantly different from values of col- <dig> at p <  <dig>  by student’s t test.

next, we examined phenotypic variation supported with physiological measurements of 3 week old seedlings of two camta <dig> alleles  and col- <dig> in water and drought condition then allowed to recover for 3 days, during which they were watered . under water condition, col- <dig> and both camta <dig> mutant  plants performed equally well. although both col- <dig> and camta <dig> mutants showed wilting of leaves under drought condition, the wilting was more pronounced in camta1- <dig> and camta1- <dig> after 14 days of with-holding water. the camta <dig> mutant had stunted round leaves showing wrinkling; appearance of pale yellow and leaves were dried . the prominent phenotypic variation under drought condition includes significant decrease in rosette leaves count, rosette area, leaf area and primary root length . after the recovery period of 3 days, camta <dig> mutant showed poor survivability  while more than 86% of col- <dig> plants survived and continued to grow after giving water . recently, water use efficiency  of many plant species were related to isotopic ratio of 13c to 12c  <cit> . thus we determined the isotopic ratio of 13c to 12c for col- <dig> and camta <dig> mutant , the carbon isotope discrimination  value were  <dig>  for col- <dig> while  <dig>  and  <dig>  for camta1- <dig> and camta1- <dig>  respectively . the relative increase in  value of camta <dig> mutant than col- <dig> showed that it had poor wue and hence indicates higher sensitivity to drought . similarly, fv/fm ratio  was also significantly reduced in camta1- <dig>  and camta1- <dig>  than col- <dig>  recorded after with-holding water for 14 days  . after rescuing the plant from water-defict condition by rewatering them for 3 days, the increase in fv/fm ratio in col- <dig> reached at par to the water condition. while camta <dig> mutant had poor recovery in fv/fm ratio as compared to col- <dig>  the relative water content  was reduced by 26% and 20% in camta1- <dig> and camta1- <dig>  respectively as compared to col- <dig> under drought condition . after rewatering, the rwc of col- <dig> reached to 90% while camta1- <dig>  and camta1- <dig>  showed decline in rwc. the phenotypic variation, poor wue, low photosystem ii efficiency, decline in rwc and higher sensitivity to drought with reduced survivability of camta <dig> can be correlated with the decreased expression level of the camta <dig> gene in mutant .the statistically significant changes have been marked with an asterisk  in respective figure . error bars indicates standard deviation sd  and asterisk indicates significantly different from values of col- <dig> at p <  <dig>  by student’s t test.

microarray experimental design to identify camta <dig> dependent genes
to understand the global regulation of gene expression by camta <dig>  we used affymetrix arabidopsis expression array ath <dig> to profile the col- <dig> and camta1- <dig> expression under drought and water conditions in leaf and root tissue. the ath <dig> array contains  <dig>  probe sets encoding  <dig>  genes/transcripts. next, by using significance analysis of microarray , p value ≤  <dig>  and fold change  ≥  <dig> were considered as significantly differentially regulated  transcripts. in col- <dig> leaves,  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> genes were down regulated in response to drought stress . we identified the status of these genes in camta1- <dig> after drought treatment by querying these genes to microarray data of camta1- <dig> in leaves . out of  <dig> genes which were up regulated in col- <dig>  the expression of  <dig> genes were significantly down regulated in camta1- <dig> . these  <dig> genes were assigned as leaf camta <dig> dependent positively regulated genes  . the expression of rest of the  <dig> out of  <dig> genes remained unaffected and hence these genes were assigned as leaf camta <dig> independent drought induced genes  . further, out of  <dig> down regulated genes in col- <dig> in response to drought, the expression of  <dig> genes were significantly changed in camta1- <dig>  and hence these genes were assigned as leaf camta <dig> dependent negatively regulated genes  . the expression of remaining  <dig> out of  <dig> genes was not changed significantly and hence these genes were assigned as leaf camta <dig> independent drought repressed genes  . the 1000 bp upstream promoters sequences of camta dependent/independent genes were then screened for presence or absence of consensus camta <dig> binding motif . the “mcgcgb” cis-element was exclusively identified as binding site of camta while “mcgtgt” cis-element along with camta was also linked to abscisic acid  signalling, the abre. the lcdprg had  <dig> % genes containing cgcg core motif and  <dig> % genes with cgtg core motif. the lcdnrg had  <dig> % and  <dig> % genes containing cgcg and cgtg, respectively . the higher number of genes with cgtg core motif could be ascribed to its overlap binding site to abre. it was noteworthy that mutation in camta <dig> resulted in almost 72-75% change in expression of transcriptome controlled by drought. the results indicate that camta <dig> is one of the global regulators of drought. similarly, in col- <dig> roots under drought condition,  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> genes were down regulated . to identify camta <dig> dependent genes, differentially expressed genes of col- <dig> were mapped and queried against camta1- <dig> genes . out of  <dig> differentially up regulated genes in col- <dig>  the expression of  <dig> genes were significantly down regulated in camta1- <dig> . these  <dig> genes were termed as root camta <dig> dependent positively regulated genes  . the expression of  <dig> genes out of  <dig> genes remained unaffected and hence these genes were assigned as root camta <dig> independent drought induced genes  . next, out of  <dig> down regulated genes in col- <dig> in response to drought, the expression of  <dig> genes were significantly changed in camta1- <dig>  and hence these genes were assigned as root camta <dig> dependentnegatively regulated genes   while expression of remaining  <dig> genes was not much altered hence termed as root camta <dig> independent drought repressed genes  . the camta recognition cis-elements identified revealed higher occurrence of mcgtgt than mcgcgb motif. in rcdprg  <dig> % genes contained mcgcgb while  <dig> % genes contained mcgtgt motif and in rcdnrg  <dig> % and  <dig> % genes had mcgcgb and mcgtgt motif, respectively . as we were interested in elucidating the role of camta <dig> protein under drought stress, our further analysis was focussed on camta <dig> dependent genes. therefore, in following work and discussion we will be considering lcdprg, lcdnrg and rcdprg, rcdnrg.

the expression profiles  of genes obtained through microarray were experimentally validated through rt-pcr using  <dig> genes belonging to dihydroflavonoid 4-reductase, lea, oxidoreductase, lipid transfer protein, glutathionin s-transferase and anthocyanidin synthase. the results obtained from all the  <dig> genes tested by rt-pcr agree with the trend of regulation identified by microarray analysis . thus results of rt-pcr validate the microarray data.

the strategy depicted in figure  <dig>  is to understand the role of camta <dig> in drought condition which is the unique part of our study. camta <dig> may have a role in normal physiology, also revealed by the fact that camta <dig> gene expresses ubiquitously at control and drought condition in arabidopsis . we made the comparison between wt-c and m1-c and identified that camta <dig> does regulate a group of genes since in leaf tissue,  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> genes were up-regulated in camta1- <dig> as compared to col- <dig> under water condition. in root tissue,  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> genes were down regulated. the agrigo analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicate that the camta <dig> under control condition regulates pathways over represented by response to stimulus, response to chemical stimulus, response to organic stimulus substance, response to chitin, response to endogenous stimulus, response to hormone stimulus etc., . the pathways involved in various regulatory mechanisms were also altered in camta1- <dig> under control like transcription regulator activity, regulation of macromolecule biosynthetic process, regulation of primary metabolic process, regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process etc. . alternatively this has facilitated in inferring the tissue specific pathways regulated by camta1- <dig> under water condition. the most significant pathway exclusively present in leaf tissue includes transcription regulator activity, response to carbohydrate stimulus, response to chitin etc. the pathways over represented in only root tissue were oxidoreductase activity, regulation of biosynthetic process, metal ion binding etc. .

the analysis of camta <dig> dependent genes for identifying biological processes and pathways regulated by camta1
to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the enhanced sensitivity of the camta1- <dig> towards limited water condition, we identified and analysed biological pathways, gene regulation networks and protein interaction maps with camta <dig> dependent genes by pathway studio  <dig>  and agrigo  analysis tools keeping a stringent cut-off of p-value ≤  <dig>  for identifying significant biological identities. the analysis was carried out firstly with lcdprg, lcdnrg and rcdprg, rcdngr and simultaneously the genes containing camta1-recognition motif were analysed to identify specific cis-elements governed potential changes in cellular functions and associated transcriptome interaction networks. this data analysis strategy, in a global and unbiased manner, identifies cellular changes driven specifically by camta <dig> along with its recognition motif .

camta <dig> dependent positive regulation: involved in stress response and maintained osmotic balance of cell under drought stress and targets plasma membrane
the possible functional categories that govern the responses of camta <dig> dependent positively regulated genes of leaf and root tissue featured several regulators and associate pathways. the most important cell process in lcdprg includes ‘drought recovery’  and in rcdprg includes ‘k + import/homeostasis’ . the stress adaptation regulated by camta <dig> for root and leaf tissue influences the pathways related to response to auxin stimulus, hypersensitive response, defense response, plant response, cold acclimation, response to ethylene stimulus, aba response, salinity response, response to osmotic stress etc. . camta <dig> protein probably favored plant growth and development rather than directing it towards cell death and senescence. various such pathways include root development, plant development, plant morphology, seed germination, flower development, xylem loading, root growth, shoot growth and stem strength . the motif-specific  driven processes for lcdprg include sugar concentration, plant viability, leaf size, shoot branching, cell adhesion etc. . for rcdprg, a motif-specific process includes plant development cell expansion, lipid peroxidation, membrane fusion, root hair tip growth etc. . the functional class in lcdprg was protein kinase a , heat shock protein, aba binding factor  and sucrose transporters while in rcdprg were h + −transporting two-sector atpase, calmodulin, histone deacetylase and pka . in agrigo, majority of genes were associated to membrane like plasma membrane and membrane part, followed by transporter activity in lcdprg and rcdprg . other important go terms modulated in lcdprg were response to water deprivation, response to osmotic stress, extrinsic to membrane, flavanoid biosynthetic process, integral to membrane etc. . the significant go terms in rcdprg includes transport, protein amino-acid phosphorylation, response to carbohydrate stimulus, homeostatic process, auxin homeostatic, response to water depriviation, peroxidase activity, signal transducer activity etc. .

camta <dig> dependent negative regulation: involved in cell differentiation – apoptosis, affect photosynthesis efficiency and targets chloroplast
camta <dig> dependent negatively regulated genes had several pathways related to cell differentiation and propagation imparting controlled cell division which could be ascribed to decreased rate of cell death  and senescence. various such cell processes were cell differentiation, dna methylation, apoptosis, abscission, dehiscence, cytokinesis, cell proliferation, s phase, chromatin remodeling, chloroplast organization and biogenesis . the over-represented pathways in lcdnrg were related to leaf anatomy and photosynthesis like, leaf shape, stomatal density, leaf senescence, transpiration, photosynthetic electron transport . other important cell processes negatively regulated by camta <dig> were ros generation, xenobiotic clearance, fatty acid metabolism, pentose phosphate shunt, microgametogenesis . the motif specific cell processes in lcdnrg were chloroplast function, glycolysis, photorespiration, phenyl propanoid metabolism, rna splicing etc. . likewise in rcdnrg, motif specific cell process were post transcriptional gene silencing , sulphate assimilates, nitrogen assimilates, seed abscission etc. . the functional class for lcdnrg includes cellulose synthase, plastocyanin and for rcdnrg includes aspartate transaminase, glutathione transferase  . the go analysis of lcdnrg revealed large number of genes related to photosynthesis machinery like chloroplast, plastid, thylakoid, photosystem, photosynthetic membrane etc. . the significant go terms in rcdnrg were response to hydrogen peroxide, glutathione transferase activity, peptide transport, phenylpropanoid metabolic process, fatty acid metabolic process etc. .

camta <dig> involvement in abiotic stress management
to monitor the role in various abiotic stress conditions, camta <dig> dependent genes were scanned to the stress responsive transcription factor database  for comprehensive collection of abiotic stress responsive genes. secondly, to follow the intricate and complicated networks of stress responsive transcription factors activated by camta <dig> which could be involved in the regulation of these stress responsive genes. in lcdprg,  <dig> genes ,  <dig> genes  and  <dig> genes  were responsive to drought, cold and salt, respectively hence these genes showed positive correlation  in gene expression . whereas in lcdnrg,  <dig> genes ,  <dig> genes  and  <dig> genes  were responsive to drought, cold and salt, respectively and showed negative correlation  in gene expression . for rcdprg,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were positively regulated under drought, cold and salt, respectively . while for rcdnrg,  <dig> genes were drought responsive and  <dig> genes were related to each cold and salinity . the occurrence of cgtg consensus sequence was more abundant in 1 kb upstream region due to its binding site to camta <dig> as well as abre. the results indicate the role of camta <dig> in aba dependent abiotic stress tolerance.

camta <dig> regulate prominent stress responsive genes
we next examined the substantial relationship between the expressions of stress induced transcripts between different abiotic stress conditions. for lcdprg,  <dig> stress-responsive genes that responded to all three stress condition had more than 90% similarity with camta <dig> recognition motif . among these we found  <dig> well established stress inducible genes including early-responsive to dehydration  <dig>  , responsive to aba  <dig>  , responsive to desiccation 26/ <dig>  , cold regulated  <dig>  , low temperature-induced  <dig>   . these stress induced genes were probably expressed under the influence of camta as they were enriched with camta <dig> binding cis-elements hence presumed to be its direct binding targets. other important genes showing positive regulation in all  <dig> stresses were late embryogenesis abundant protein , cytochrome p <dig>  glyoxylate aminotransferase  <dig>  phosphatase 2ca, aba-responsive protein, etc. . there were  <dig> genes positively correlated by both drought and cold,  <dig> genes for cold and salinity and  <dig> genes regulated by both drought and high salinity. some genes were unique to their stress condition,  <dig> genes were exclusively regulated by drought,  <dig> genes by cold and  <dig> genes induced only under high salinity . in lcdprg, genes modulated only under the drought stress includes nac tf , myb tf , lipid transfer protein 4/ <dig>  , glucose phosphate translocator  <dig>  , udp-glucosyl transferase 85a <dig> , scarecrow-like  <dig> , cytochrome p <dig>  aaa-type atpase, senescence-related gene  <dig>  etc. . expression of genes altered exclusively by salt were wd- <dig> repeat family protein  , gcr2-like  <dig>  , hexokinase  <dig>  jasmonic acid responsive  <dig>  h-atpase  <dig>  cystatin, etc. . exclusively, cold related genes include expansin a <dig> , phosphatidyl serine decarboxylase  <dig> , rap <dig>  and  <dig>  , ethylene response sensor  <dig>  , ap2-tf, copper chaperone, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  <dig>  etc. . similarly, for rcdprg, analysis enabled in identifying gene expression with overlapped and/or for specific stress condition. we found  <dig> genes whose expression was positively regulated under drought, cold and salinity and among these some of the known stress inducible genes driven by camta <dig> were rd <dig>  nodulin protein, cbl-interacting protein kinase  <dig>  dark inducible  <dig> , ferretin  <dig>  . in rcdprg,  <dig> genes got affected under both drought and salt,  <dig> genes by drought and cold and  <dig> genes got affected by salinity and cold . some of the important genes showing positive correlation in drought and salt includes phytoene desaturation  <dig>  rd <dig> , acyl-coa oxidase  <dig> , phytoene desaturation  <dig>  , myc <dig> , tetraspanin  <dig> , cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase , ora <dig> transcription factor  . genes that showed altered expression under both drought and cold were ethylene-responsive element binding factor  <dig>  , c-repeat/dre binding factor  <dig>  , dormancy-associated protein  <dig>  , aba <dig> , wrky <dig> , sensitive to freezing  <dig>  etc. genes affected under salt and cold includes acetolactate synthase , plasma membrane intrinsic protein 1a, peroxidase  <dig>  etc. . there were  <dig> genes positively modulated exclusively by drought stress like lipoxygenase , protein kinase  <dig> , glycosyl hydrolase , carboxyesterase  <dig> , etc. there were  <dig> and  <dig> genes specifically related to salt and cold, respectively with positive correlation  

the lcdnrg had  <dig> genes negatively correlated  to all  <dig> stresses  and among them majority of genes has been well characterized for stress adaptation like salt tolerance zinc finger , arabidopsis nac domain containing protein  <dig>  , germin-like protein  <dig> , erd <dig> , photosystem i subunit h , carbonic anhydrase <dig> . the negatively regulated genes had functional redundancy by showing altered expression in more than one stress condition. there were  <dig> genes modulated under drought and salt condition,  <dig> genes affected by both cold and drought condition while  <dig> genes got affected by salinity and cold . genes specifically modulated by drought has  <dig> genes, among them some of the important genes include cinnamoyl coa reductase  <dig>  auxin-responsive protein, fructose-bisphosphatealdolase, oxidoreductase, tonoplast intrinsic protein  <dig> etc. there were  <dig> cold specific genes like beta galactosidase  <dig> , myb <dig>  sugar transporter  <dig>  btb domain protein  <dig> , beta-amylase  <dig>  udp-glucosyl transferase 73b <dig> etc. . there were  <dig> genes exclusively affected under cold condition, some of the important genes were myb <dig>  erf <dig>  hydrolase  <dig>  glutathione s-transferase , anac <dig>  acc synthase  <dig>  etc. . in rcdnrg,  <dig> genes were specifically negatively altered by drought like oxidoreductase, alanine aminotransferase , dnaj heat shock protein  <dig>  , 2-alkenal reductase , beta-ketoacyl-coa synthase , carboxyesterase  <dig> , etc. genes specifically modulated  by cold and salinity were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . in rcdnrg,  <dig> genes were affected by all the  <dig> stress condition and majority of them were known stress responsive genes like hsp <dig>  rab <dig> , lea, cor15a, erd9/ <dig>  lti <dig>  cor <dig>  etc. for either of the  <dig> stress condition camta <dig> had  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes affected by drought-salt, drought-cold and salt-cold, respectively .

interaction of camta <dig> with different hormonal pathways
we next examined probable involvement of different phytohormone in co-regulating genes with camta <dig>  thus, genes involved in biosynthesis and signaling of phytohormones were classified into  <dig> classes viz, abscisic, auxin, brassinosteroid, ethylene, gibberellin, jasmonic, salicylic, cytokinin identified by arabidopsis hormone database  <dig>  . in lcdprg  <dig> genes were identified showing positive correlation with various phytohormone associated genes. the response to aba was most pronounced fetching 40% , some of them are known to play role in stress adaptation especially drought like rab <dig>  heat shock transcription factor c <dig>  wrky <dig>  phospholipase d, cor <dig>  etc. . the second most affected phytohormone was ethylene contributing  <dig> %  like ethylene response sensor  <dig>  rd29b, serine-rich splicing factor  <dig>  followed by auxin  and gibberlin  . from lcdnrg,  <dig> genes showed negative correlation to phytohormone associated genes and among them maximum number of genes were associated to auxin constituting  <dig> %  like myb <dig>  bt <dig>  auxin-responsive protein  <dig>  . next, brassinosteroid  was the second phytohormone contributing  <dig> genes  such as br enhanced expression  <dig> and  <dig>  expansin a <dig>  bes1-interacting myc protein . in rcdprg,  <dig> genes were related to phytohormones. concurrent with the phytohormone analysis of leaf tissue, rcdprg contain maximum number of genes  related to aba response . we can postulate that camta <dig> activated the aba signalling under drought condition in both leaf and root tissue and hence probably major expression of aba responsive genes were controlled by camta <dig> protein. next, auxin response  was generated by camta <dig> followed by ethylene  and salicylic acid . some of the relevant genes associated with aba includes aba <dig> , ethylene insensitive  <dig>  myc <dig> , cbf <dig> , rho-related protein  <dig>  etc. auxin responsive genes co-regulated with camta <dig> were indole-3-butyric acid response  <dig>  dormancy-associated protein  <dig>  auxin efflux protein, auxin-responsive protein .

camta <dig> regulate expression of various global transcription factors involved in abiotic stress
to understand the role of camta <dig> protein in transcriptional regulation in drought stress, camta <dig> dependent genes encodes various transcription factors sorted out by arabidopsis gene regulatory information server . there are known  <dig>  transcription factor belonging to  <dig> families, based on the presence of conserved domains. out of these  <dig> families,  <dig> were targeted by camta <dig> protein. these  <dig> tfs regulated by camta <dig> under drought stress were further grouped on the basis of occurrence of camta1-recognition motif in the 1 kb upstream region of the gene. from the analysis, we obtained  <dig> ap2-erebp being over-represented tf in camta <dig> dependent genes of leaf  . the 83% genes  encoding ap <dig> have camta <dig> recognition site in their promoter region. the ap <dig> associated genes enriched with camta <dig> binding site in lcdprg has  <dig> genes which annotates  <dig> dreb member   <dig> erf  and other  <dig> were ap <dig> domain protein . there were  <dig> genes encoding ap <dig> in lcdnrg which includes  <dig> erf ,  <dig> dreb member  and  <dig> ap2-domain protein . the annotation of various genes of ap <dig> and presence of camta <dig> binding site clearly indicates that camta <dig> target ap <dig> associated genes in a specific manner by binding to distinct set of subfamily in highly specific manner. myb was another tf important for drought tolerance. the probable tf acting as positive regulator for camta <dig> activation could be heat shock protein factor  , squamosa binding protein  and ccaat-hap , as they were exclusively present in positively regulated genes of leaf and contain camta <dig> binding site in their promoter region . while tf acting as negative regulator of camta <dig> could be bhlh as  <dig> genes associated to bhlh  were present in lcdnrg containing  <dig> genes with cgtg and  <dig> with cgcg binding motif . concurrent with leaf tissue, in rcdprg, ap2-erebp established maximum connection with the camta <dig> showing large number of associated genes . there were  <dig> members of ap <dig> which were positively regulated  and  <dig> members were negatively regulated by camta <dig> . the wrky , g2-like  and c2h <dig> acted as positive regulator whereas myb  acted as negative regulator .

the transcriptome of camta1- <dig> and camta1-3
the transcriptome of camta1- <dig> by galon et al.,  <dig>  was compared with the gene expression profiling of camta1- <dig>  and has a correlation of r =  <dig>  . the  <dig> genes were commonly up-regulated while  <dig> genes were commonly down regulated in both camta1- <dig> and camta1- <dig> as compared to wild type col- <dig>  some of the interesting commonly expressed genes have been listed in additional file  <dig>  the expression of chalcone synthase, udp-glucoronosyl, polygalacturonase, early light-inducable protein, cysteine proteinase, ethylene-responsive element-binding family protein, disease resistance protein etc. were found to be repressed in both camta1- <dig> and camta1- <dig>  similarly, some of the commonly up regulated genes include mannitol transporter, wall-associated kinase, glycine-rich protein, cytochrome p <dig>  arr <dig> , wrky <dig> etc. . as reported in galon et. al,  <dig> study  <cit> , the transcriptome comparative study between two alleles of camta <dig> mutant  through mapman showed similar pathways when analysed for camta1- <dig>  the similar pathways between camta1- <dig> and camta1- <dig> includes cytokinin metabolism, metabolism of sulphur containing compounds, flavanoids . therefore the transcript profiling of camta1- <dig> was in concurrent with earlier reported pathways affected by camta <dig> mutant.

this is the first report elucidating the role of camta <dig> gene in drought stress, exploring through the transcript analysis of the camta1- <dig> mutant. we identified that camta <dig> was most susceptible to drought stress . the most striking difference was that camta1- <dig> and camta1- <dig> showed inward adaxial rolling of leaf and severe loss of chlorophyll showing apparently damaged yellow to purplish-black appearance and stunted growth which revealed enhanced effect of drought on camta <dig> as compared to col- <dig> . the different abiotic stress response of plants depends on root growth and the stage of development  <cit> . therefore, we tried to determine the effect of osmotic stress on camta <dig> by root bending assay. under osmotic stress , the reduction in shoot weight and inhibition of root growth was more in camta1- <dig> as compared to col- <dig> . at 300mm mannitol and  <dig> % peg, significant growth retardation in terms of rosette leaves, shoot weight and primary root length could be ascribed to the silencing of the camta <dig> gene in mutant  . thus, we hypothesize that camta <dig> acts as positive regulator of plant growth under drought stress based on our observation in osmotic and drought stress experiment in soil . after rewatering, the camta <dig> mutant  exhibited growth inhibition, whereas the col- <dig> plants thrived well indicating that loss of functional camta <dig> protein in mutants had a negative role against drought stress . the carbon isotopes discrimination , relative water content  and photosystem ii efficiency  can prove an important criterion for the selection of plant with variable drought tolerance. according to farquhar gd et.al, a shift in the cid ratio of plant gives information about the plant water use efficiency  and indicates the plant inherent trait to adapt under stress condition and confirms the stress induced changes in the 12c/13c ratio  <cit> . the variation between the cid values of col- <dig> and camta <dig> indicates that the plant significantly discriminate between heavier and lighter carbon during photosynthesis . earlier report states that the variation in cid was known to arise from variation in photosynthetic capacity, stomatal conductance, wue  <cit> . the reduction in fv/fm ratio might primarily be due to decline in rwc. the low wue, rwc and decreased efficiency of photosystem ii of the camta <dig> attributes to the poor tolerance of plant for the drought stress which may be due the loss of camta <dig> function in the mutant suggesting its probable role in stress tolerance. in brief, we hypothesized that camta <dig> apparently plays a role in the natural plant development under stress condition, because its mutation clearly results in stunted plant growth with altered root development and increased sensitivity to osmotic stress. the data indicates that the camta <dig> gene is required for stress responses that improve drought tolerance through various response mechanisms . the disruption of functional camta protein in mutant resulted in alteration of various regulatory pathways and stress responses . to broaden our knowledge horizon for the role of camta <dig> gene, the comparative analysis of gene profiling under drought and control condition of col- <dig> and camta1- <dig> was studied. the transcript analysis showed decreased gene count in camta1- <dig> than col- <dig> under drought condition . this clearly reflects that expression of large number of stress induced transcripts were reduced to non-significant level  due to the disruption of the camta <dig> protein in the mutant resulting in masked expression of its respective target genes. secondly, the increase in gene count in col- <dig> was due to drought stress imposed on plant which depicts large number of genes have undergone reprogramming under drought stress .

to identify in equitable and unprejudiced way, genes regulated by camta <dig>  the genes were selected on the basis of their non-significant expression level in camta1- <dig> with respect to its respective significant expression in the col- <dig>  thus camta <dig> dependent genes were classified as either positively regulated viz., lcdprg and rcdprg or negatively regulated viz., lcdnrg and rcdnrg. motif-analysis facilitated in identifying camta <dig> binding site in various abiotic stress, phytohormone and tfs related genes which could be later used in establishing their binding affinity to the camta <dig> cis-element  . the pathway analysis strategy, in a global and unbiased manner, identifies cellular changes driven by specific camta <dig> recognition motif genes. the most distinguished cell process was “drought recovery” as it clearly indicates the potential nature of camta <dig> protein to combat and recover under drought stress . drought stress does not affect the plant in isolation but comes in combitorial with other stress condition. for the plant to sustain drought stress, camta <dig> protein channelizes several stress responsive cell processes and develops plethora of responses that might help the plant to acclimatize and survive in the stressed environment. the higher number of stress responsive genes, signal sensors and transporters in lcdprg and rcdprg indicates the expression of more genes associated with stress mechanism. signal transduction and transporters play major role under drought condition by maintaining osmotic homeostasis, operates the signalling and growth development pathways   <cit> . the genes encoding plasma membrane and its constituents acted as positive regulator indicating the presence of several genes associated to membrane integrity and biogenesis which were involved in the formation, organization, maintenance of the membrane and in turn protects the cell against mechanical damage, osmotic strength   <cit> . the higher expression of these under the influence of camta <dig> maintains membrane structure and preserve cell compartmentation and by synthesizing constituent macromolecules under drought condition provides rapid tolerance to stress  <cit> . the accumulation of flavonoid is a trademark of plant stress  <cit>  which aims at countering the generation of ros and leads to the inactivation of antioxidant enzymes constituting a secondary ros-scavenging system in plants which are exposed to stress conditions   <cit> . thus positive regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis imparts tolerance to the plant when exposed to the drought condition. photosynthesis plays a pivotal role in plant performance under drought. in lcdnrg, there were several genes related to photosynthesis, stomata, chlorophyll, heme, fad and transpiration . the decline in photosynthesis machinery results in lower net carbon uptake in leaf under water deficit condition which is followed by an alteration in partitioning of the photoassimilates at the plant level, consequently leads to an increase in the root to shoot ratio   <cit> . this is the prima facie for the maintenance of root growth under decreasing water in the soil. in general, this response is mediated by phytohormone, namely by abscisic acid   <cit> . the camta <dig> generates response to aba and auxin which induces lateral root formation for optimal water uptake as profilic root system is vital for drought tolerance . tightly regulated expression of phytohormone under drought condition determines lateral root meristem activation via an aba-auxin signalling crosstalk and ethylene   <cit> . in previous reports growth promotion is considered a specific feature for ethylene response, so to establish equilibrium, plant optimize growth and tolerate stress response which involves the synthesis of ethylene  <cit> . during drought stress response, aba regulates stomatal aperture and leads to activation of several genes and secondary messengers, including calcium, inositol trisphosphate, cadp, ribose, etc.  <cit> . hence conjugated effect of phytohormones induced development and photosynthetic regulation directs the plant for survival in stress environment. the presence of aba indicates the concerted action of camta <dig> in cell signalling which progressively leads to a massive reprogramming to combat stress . heat shock proteins , known as molecular chaperon, rapidly accumulates under stress condition and play a major role in protein folding   <cit> . numerous studies on histone and dna methylation highlights its key role in gene expression and plant development under stress  <cit> . apart from its role in development under stress, dna methylation was also associated with gene silencing and transposon control in plant and fungi  <cit> . recent studies indicate that transcriptional gene silencing and post transcriptional gene silencing  were mechanistically related because they were correlated to same events, including changes in dna methylation  <cit> . the cell differentiation, propogation and reprogramming were governed by major changes in the epigenome  <cit> . camta <dig> acts as a negative regulator for the dna methylation, gene silencing, apoptosis, cell proliferation, ptgs. hence by negatively regulating the epigenetic mediated gene silencing and cell differentiation, camta <dig> probably decreases the rate of silenced gene and ptgs and allows the expression of several genes potential for generating appropriate cellular responses which could be otherwise masked by the effect of dna methylation . secondly by inhibiting dna methylation and cell differentiation, camta <dig> tightly regulates genetics events governing plants death or else the cell differentiation could eventually leads to developmental cell senescence  <cit> . therefore by acting as a negative regulator to dna methylation and cell proliferation camta <dig> protects the plant from untimely stress induced senescence and directs the expression of stress responsive genes. study on cellulose synthase by chen z et.al in  <dig> revealed that its mutant were more tolerant to drought stress as well as to nacl, mannitol and found higher accumulation of osmolytes and aba in mutant than col- <dig>  <cit> . hence decrease in cellulose synthase gene expression enhances drought tolerance which was in concurrent with the reduction of the cellulose synthase by camta <dig> . the lea proteins protect various macromolecules, such as enzymes and lipids, from dehydration  <cit> .

the stress responsive genes such as erd <dig>  rab <dig>  rd <dig>  cor <dig> encoded the protein which helps in protecting cells from water deficit and regulating genes for signal transduction and gene expression in the water stress response   <cit> . these genes have been earlier reported as aba-responsive like dreb, lea proteins and rab <dig> in rice  <cit> , dehydrins in barley  <cit> , and rd <dig> in a.thaliana <cit> . these “stress responsive genes” were rapidly induced by stress conditions  <cit> . several transcription factors such as dreb1b and dreb1c govern the stress regulations and contain the ap <dig> domain and bind to the dre/crt motif in drought, high salt and cold stress-responsive gene promoters, mediates their downstream gene expression to help the plant survive in a stressed environment   <cit> . earlier studies revealed that many drought-responsive genes such as rd29a, lti, cor <dig>  and rd <dig> and rab <dig> were also induced by cold stress in a dreb1a-dependent manner. these genes were probably expressed under the influence of camta <dig> as they are enriched with camta <dig> binding cis-elements hence presumed to be its direct targets . large numbers of drought induced genes were also induced by salinity, which indicates a strong correlation between drought and salt signaling response generated by camta <dig> dependent genes . this depicts camta <dig> capability to adapt to dual stress condition and indicates the existence of cross-talk between drought and salinity response. it has been documented that biosynthesis and accumulation of aba, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and auxin phytohormone are closely linked with drought resistance responses in many plant species. the associated tfs of aba signaling such as myb and wrky cascades the drought stress response and modulates the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolic pathways in response to drought by regulating gene expression . as part of the regulation of drought stress responses, aba may interact with jasmonic acid and stimulate stomatal closure, while its regulation of gene expression includes the induction of genes associated with response to ethylene, cytokinin, or auxin. jasmonic and salicylic acid signalling response were enriched in lcdnrg . the camta <dig> dependent tfs likely represent key elements in the ability of the camta <dig> to modify gene expression as part of the plant drought response. the expression of  <dig> ap <dig>   <dig> bzip,  <dig> myb,  <dig> wrky, and  <dig> gras tfs genes were positively regulated by camta <dig> . members from these tf families were previously shown to modulate response of plant drought stress  <cit> . the tfs belonging to these families interact with specific cis-elements and/or proteins; and their over expression confers stress tolerance in heterologous systems  <cit> . among the tfs, erf subgroups  hsf, wrky and c2h <dig> were induced and previous reports stated their ability to regulate osmotic and drought responses   <cit> . camta <dig> positively induced the expression of these transcription factor and others drought responsive genes, probably by binding to cgcg and cgtg boxes in promoter region of these target genes . likewise the expressions of the different member of same family responded negatively under drought stress for example,  <dig> ap <dig>   <dig> bzip,  <dig> myb, and  <dig> wrky. overproduction of either ap <dig> or other regulatory proteins in plants resulted in deleterious effects on plant growth and development  <cit> . in nature, ap <dig>  bzip and myb exhibit stress-inducible expression patterns in response to various stresses such as drought, salt and cold  <cit> . therefore the down regulated expression of these transcription factors restricts the expression of various genes and control the levels of regulatory proteins for maintaining the homeostasis of plants. the in-depth interrogation of camta <dig> dependent genes lead us to hypothesis a biological network involved in drought stress guarded by camta  <dig> . it indicates that majority of camta <dig> dependent genes were localized to plasma membrane and chloroplast which positively regulates stress response and osmotic balance while negatively involved in photosynthesis. these regulatory pathways were channeled through various adaptative and stress responsive genes like rab <dig>  cor <dig>  cbf <dig>  erd <dig> etc. the expressions of these genes were controlled by tfs like dreb, bhlh, myb etc., which in turn were activated by camta <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results establish a role for camta <dig> in drought acclimation and provide a possible point of integrating various molecular and biological pathways with drought stress regulated gene expression. the interaction with several stress responsive genes, maintenance of osmoticum, regulating membrane biogenesis, generating aba response, guarding photosynthesis and interaction with ap2-erebp were some of the key regulatory components of camta <dig> in response to drought stress. these findings provide insight for further investigation of camta <dig> function under drought stress and open new perspectives for improving drought tolerance which could eventually lead to better crop production.
