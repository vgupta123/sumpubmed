BACKGROUND
the wheat gluten proteins represent about 80% of the grain protein and confer the unique viscoelastic properties that enable the production of bread, noodles, tortillas and many other food products from wheat flour. the gluten proteins are made up of gliadins, a heterogeneous collection of monomeric proteins that are associated with extensibility properties, and glutenins, a group of proteins that confer elasticity properties and form some of the largest polymers known in nature . both gliadins and glutenins have highly repetitive sequences with an abundance of glutamine and proline residues. the gliadins have molecular weights  from about  <dig>  to  <dig>  and are separated into alpha, gamma and omega subgroups, each containing many protein species with similar sequences. proteins within each subgroup have distinct n-terminal and c-terminal sequences. the structures of the proteins and the number and arrangement of cysteine residues within proteins of each gliadin subgroup also are distinct. alpha gliadins contain  <dig> conserved cysteine residues that form three intrachain crosslinks and gamma gliadins contain  <dig> conserved cysteine residues that form four intrachain crosslinks. omega gliadins do not contain any cysteine. the glutenins consist of lmw-glutenin subunits with mws similar to those of alpha and gamma gliadins and hmw-glutenin subunits of about  <dig>  to  <dig>  mw that are linked by interchain disulfide bonds into polymers that range from  <dig>  to more than  <dig> million mw. both the amount and the size of the glutenin polymers are important for flour quality. in addition to the traditional gliadins and glutenins, certain proteins with amino acid sequences very similar to gliadins contain an extra cysteine residue that enables them to be incorporated into the glutenin polymer  <cit> . these proteins are structurally similar to gliadins but functionally similar to lmw-glutenin subunits. it has been hypothesized that these proteins serve as chain terminators of the glutenin polymer thereby limiting its size and influencing the quality of the flour  <cit> .

environmental conditions during wheat grain development can affect wheat flour quality. changes in the accumulation of individual gluten proteins during grain development in response to high temperatures and fertilizer have been detected in the us bread wheat butte  <dig>  <cit> . however, it has been difficult to determine the identities of individual gluten proteins using approaches that work for most other proteins, in part because the gluten proteins yield relatively few peptides of a size suitable for ms/ms analysis when digested with trypsin, the enzyme used in most proteomic studies  <cit> . additionally, the identification of proteins by ms/ms is based on the best fit of spectral data to databases of protein sequences. although current databases contain sequences for many wheat gluten proteins, these represent only a portion of the sequence heterogeneity present in the gluten protein families. to distinguish individual gamma gliadin proteins from the us wheat butte  <dig> that are influenced by temperature or fertilizer and identify gliadin-like proteins that could serve as chain terminators, we first examined the complement of gamma gliadin genes expressed in this cultivar by analyzing publicly available est data. the availability of protein sequences derived from these genes allowed us to interpret ms/ms data obtained from an analysis of butte  <dig> flour and associate individual gluten proteins with the sequences of specific genes.

RESULTS
assembly of butte  <dig> contigs for gamma gliadins
a total of  <dig> ests from triticum aestivum cv. butte  <dig> developing grain were identified by searching the dana farber cancer institute triticum aestivum gene index  release  <dig>   <cit> . one hundred forty one of these were assembled into new contigs  accession numbers for ests within each contig and consensus sequences of contigs can be found in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. twelve ests represented partial sequences of gamma gliadin genes that did not align with any other ests. these were excluded from further analysis . sixteen ests, all representing 3' portions of gamma gliadin coding regions, were assigned to more than one contig. of these, seven ests were assigned to both contigs # <dig> and  <dig> and nine ests were assigned to both contigs # <dig> and  <dig> . although the 5' end of contig # <dig> is represented by only one est, , this est has sufficient overlap  with others to justify the creation of a separate contig. similarly, one est, , represents the 5' end of contig # <dig>   has more than  <dig> bp overlap with several ests that make up the 3' end, again justifying the creation of a separate contig.

contigs # <dig> and  <dig> contain the greatest number of ests,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, suggesting that these sequences are the most highly expressed gamma gliadins in butte  <dig> . contigs # <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contain between  <dig> and  <dig> ests not found in any other contigs, suggesting that these gamma gliadin genes are moderately expressed. contigs # <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are likely to be expressed at low levels since each contains only  <dig> or  <dig> ests. contigs # <dig> and  <dig> also may be expressed at low levels, given that each contains only one est not assigned to any other contig.

when used to search the ncbi non-redundant database, the consensus sequences of eight butte  <dig> contigs  were most similar to dna sequences identified in t. aestivum, one contig  was most similar to a sequence from t. turgidum and two contigs  were most similar to sequences in aegilops species . only contig # <dig> was a perfect match with a sequence reported previously.

comparison of butte  <dig> gamma gliadin contigs with contigs from other est assemblies
a number of est databases include sequences from butte  <dig> developing grain. however, contigs from these databases are not necessarily accurate representations of the gamma gliadins present in this cultivar. each database includes a different collection of ests, utilizes different algorithms for assembly, and groups ests somewhat differently. to evaluate which est databases were likely to contain the most accurate representation of butte  <dig> gamma gliadin genes, contigs containing each butte  <dig> gamma gliadin est were identified in four publicly available est assemblies . the us wheat genome project assembly  <cit>  included  <dig>  ests and  <dig>  contigs. this assembly used phrap with penalty- <dig>  minmatch  <dig>  minscore  <dig>  thereby allowing any  <dig> sequences with at least 90% sequence similarity over  <dig> bases to form a contig. all ests from nine of the butte  <dig> contigs  were assigned to single contigs in the us wheat genome project assembly, while ests from butte  <dig> contigs # <dig> and  <dig> were distributed between two different contigs. the harvest:wheat version  <dig>  assembly   <cit>  contained  <dig>  ests and  <dig>  contigs. this assembly used cap <dig>  <cit> . all ests from six butte  <dig> contigs  were found in single contigs in harvest  <dig> , while ests from four contigs  were divided between two contigs and ests from contig # <dig> were distributed among three different contigs. tagi assemblies from dana farber cancer institute  <cit>  required a minimum match of  <dig> base pairs with greater than 94% identity in the overlap region and a maximum unmatched overhang of  <dig> base pairs. tagi release  <dig>  contained  <dig>  ests and  <dig>  contigs. all of the ests contained within seven butte  <dig> contigs  were grouped in single contigs in tagi release  <dig> . ests from butte  <dig> contigs # <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found in two tagi contigs while ests from contig # <dig> were distributed among three tagi contigs. ests from only five butte  <dig> contigs  were grouped in single contigs in the updated tagi assembly, release  <dig> , which included  <dig> , <dig> ests. ests from butte  <dig> contigs # <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> each fell into two contigs and ests from contigs # <dig> and  <dig> were each distributed among three contigs in this assembly.

characterization of butte  <dig> gamma gliadin proteins
consensus sequences for nine of the eleven butte  <dig> contigs contain complete coding regions for gamma gliadin proteins. contig # <dig> is missing a portion of the 3' end of the coding region and contig # <dig> is missing a portion of the 5' end of the coding region . full-length proteins encoded by the nine contigs range from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids . all contain a  <dig> amino acid signal peptide predicted by the signal p algorithm  <cit> . the predicted mws of the mature proteins range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and the predicted pis of the proteins range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . figure  <dig> shows a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the full-length gamma gliadins encoded by butte  <dig> contigs. protein domains typical of gamma gliadins are indicated as described by anderson et al.  <cit> . regions i, iii and v are very similar in the different butte  <dig> proteins and the positions of  <dig> cysteine residues in region iii and  <dig> cysteine residues in region v are conserved. regions ii and iv vary among the proteins. region ii is comprised of between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids in the nine butte  <dig> gamma gliadins, encompassing from  <dig> to 51% of each mature protein sequence . proline and glutamine make up between  <dig> and 82% of the amino acid residues and determine the repetitive nature of this region. four of the butte  <dig> gamma gliadins  also contain an additional cysteine residue in this portion of the protein. region iv ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length in the butte  <dig> proteins with much of the difference due to strings of glutamine residues.

of the nine butte  <dig> full-length gamma gliadins, only one, encoded by butte  <dig> contig # <dig>  was a perfect match with a sequence in ncbi . four butte  <dig> gamma gliadins  had only one or two amino acid differences from sequences in ncbi while four  had numerous amino acid changes. proteins encoded by contigs assembled as part of tagi release  <dig> , tagi release  <dig> , us wheat genome project, and harvest version  <dig>  were perfect matches with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> of the full-length proteins encoded by butte  <dig> contigs, respectively . all of the assemblies and the ncbi non-redundant database also contained a perfect match to the incomplete protein encoded by butte  <dig> contig # <dig>

analysis of gamma gliadins containing an extra cysteine residue
of particular interest is the fact that proteins encoded by butte  <dig> contigs # <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> each contain an additional cysteine residue in the repetitive region of the protein  <dig> amino acids from the n-terminus. seven of  <dig> ests that make up contig # <dig> and ten of  <dig> ests that make up contig # <dig> contain the tgc codon for the extra cysteine . the tgc codon for the extra cysteine is found in only one est in contig # <dig>  , and one est in contig # <dig>  . however, phred quality scores of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for  and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for  provide > <dig> % probability that these bases were called correctly  <cit> . a phylogram of butte  <dig> gamma gliadins  shows that proteins encoded by contigs # <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are closely related to the protein encoded by contig # <dig> which does not contain the extra cysteine, while the gamma gliadin encoded by contig # <dig> is most similar to the protein encoded by contig # <dig> that does not contain the extra cysteine. the gamma gliadin encoded by butte  <dig> contig # <dig> differs from that encoded by contig # <dig> by  <dig> amino acid substitutions that are spread throughout the protein, from the protein encoded by contig # <dig> by a  <dig> amino acid deletion in region ii, and from the partial gamma gliadin encoded by contig # <dig> by a  <dig> amino acid deletion and  <dig> amino acid substitutions, one of which is a serine in place of a cysteine. the protein encoded by contig # <dig> differs from that encoded by contig # <dig> by  <dig> amino acid substitutions in the signal peptide, one substitution in region i, and  <dig> substitutions, one amino acid deletion and a  <dig> amino acid insertion that contains the additional cysteine residue in region ii.

in proteins encoded by butte  <dig> contigs # <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the extra cysteine residue is found in the peptide pfcqqpqrtipq while in the protein encoded by contig # <dig>  the arginine at position  <dig> has been replaced by a glutamine . to determine the prevalence of gamma gliadins containing the additional cysteine in the ncbi non-redundant protein sequence database, a blastp search was performed of the database with the peptide pfcqqpqrtipq. this search revealed  <dig> gamma gliadin sequences that contain a cysteine residue in this region. eleven sequences were identical in this region to proteins encoded by butte  <dig> contigs # <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these included seven genomic sequences from t. aestivum cv. chinese spring, two from the synthetic wheat shw-l <dig>  one from t. aestivum cv. yamhill and one from t. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides. twenty additional sequences matched pfcqqpqqtipq found in the protein encoded by butte  <dig> contig # <dig>  most of these were from the diploid species, aegilops searsii , a. speltoides , a. bicornis, , a. longissima , a. sharonensis  and a. tauschii , one was from the tetraploid t. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, and one each was from the hexaploid t. aestivum cvs. chinese spring and cheyenne and the synthetic wheat shw-l <dig>  in two additional sequences from t. turgidum, the extra cysteine was found within the peptide pfceqpqrtipq. thus far, gamma gliadins containing the extra cysteine have not been identified in t. monococcum or t. urartu, related species containing the a genome, although numerous gamma gliadin sequences from these species are included in ncbi. the  <dig> sequences, along with those encoded by butte  <dig> contigs # <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were aligned using clustal w and a phylogram was generated . butte  <dig> gamma gliadins # <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are most similar to proteins in other bread wheats while butte  <dig> gamma gliadin # <dig> is most similar to a protein from a synthetic wheat.

in addition to the previously described sequences, ten other dna sequences have been reported in ncbi that encode gamma gliadins containing an odd number of cysteine residues that could potentially be linked into the glutenin polymer. these include four genomic sequences that encode proteins that are missing one of the conserved cysteine residues in regions iii, iv or v and six sequences that encode proteins that contain an additional cysteine residue at various locations in regions ii or v . to determine whether any of these gamma gliadins were likely to be expressed, a tblastn search was conducted of the  <dig> , <dig> triticum ests in ncbi using the amino acid sequence that surrounds the site of each added or deleted cysteine. a single est was identified that corresponds to one of the gamma gliadins containing seven cysteines, . ests corresponding to two gamma gliadins containing nine cysteines  also were found, suggesting that these may also be expressed. none of the ests were from butte  <dig>  suggesting that all of the gamma gliadins expressed in this cultivar that contain an odd number of cysteines have been identified. there is no evidence from current est data that the other seven gamma gliadin variants are expressed.

identification of butte  <dig> gamma gliadins by ms/ms
because neither the ncbi database nor any single est assembly contained sequences that matched all of the butte  <dig> gamma gliadins, specialized databases that included the butte  <dig> sequences were constructed for ms/ms identification of proteins from butte  <dig> flour . in a pilot study, butte  <dig> gamma gliadins # <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were distinguished with high levels of confidence by ms/ms in a 2% sds extract from flour . overall peptide coverage ranged from  <dig> % for gamma gliadin # <dig> to  <dig> % for gamma gliadin # <dig> . peptides identified by ms/ms that were not shared by other butte  <dig> gamma gliadins were designated as unique peptides. for gamma gliadin # <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> identified peptides were found only in this protein. seven unique peptides were generated with chymotrypsin, five with thermolysin and one with trypsin. the additional cysteine residue that characterizes gamma gliadin # <dig> was found in one chymotryptic peptide indicated in italics in table  <dig>  for gamma gliadin # <dig>   <dig> peptides covered  <dig> % of the protein sequence. fifteen unique peptides were generated with chymotrypsin, three with thermolysin and four with trypsin. for gamma gliadin # <dig>   <dig> peptides accounted for  <dig> % of the protein sequence. of the unique peptides, five were chymotryptic fragments, while two each were generated with thermolysin and trypsin. gamma gliadin # <dig> was distinguished by three unique chymotryptic peptides and eight thermolytic peptides. gamma gliadin # <dig> was distinguished by four chymotryptic peptides and one thermolytic peptide and gamma gliadin # <dig> was distinguished on the basis of one chymotryptic peptide and one thermolytic peptide. proteins in two bands could not be distinguished unequivocally from the ms/ms data. one band yielded four peptides generated with chymotrypsin, two with thermolysin and one with trypsin that are found only in butte  <dig> gamma gliadins # <dig> and  <dig>  although both proteins contain the extra cysteine residue and overall coverage was more than 37%, peptides containing this cysteine were not observed. another band yielded two peptides generated with chymotrypsin and one peptide generated with trypsin that are found only in butte  <dig> gamma gliadins # <dig> and # <dig>  however, in this case the data were not sufficient to distinguish butte  <dig> gamma # <dig>  containing eight cysteines, from gamma gliadin # <dig>  containing nine cysteines.

discussion
the complement of gamma gliadin genes expressed in a single us bread wheat cultivar was examined by assembling nine complete and two partial coding regions from butte  <dig> ests identified as gamma gliadin sequences in tagi release  <dig> . analysis of the encoded proteins highlighted the variability among gamma gliadins expressed within a single cultivar. the study also identified the sequences of four butte  <dig> gamma gliadins that contain an additional cysteine residue in region ii in addition to the eight conserved cysteines in regions iii and v. more importantly, this work facilitated the discrimination of closely related proteins in butte  <dig> flour by ms/ms, including gamma gliadins containing the additional cysteine residue.

the ncbi database contains the sequences of more than  <dig> gamma gliadins from t. aestivum and related species . yet, the data indicate that these represent only a portion of the sequence heterogeneity present in this group of gluten proteins. only one of the nine butte  <dig> contigs encoded a complete protein that was a perfect match with a sequence in ncbi. moreover, the best match in ncbi to one of the most highly expressed gamma gliadins in butte  <dig>  was to a recently reported sequence from aegilops speltoides  that differs by  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . this may be explained in part by the fact that many recent gamma gliadin sequences were obtained by amplification of either genomic dna  <cit>  or cdna  <cit>  and thus reflect variants of sequences already in the database. in addition, there are only  <dig> cdna sequences that encode complete gamma gliadin proteins in ncbi. these include nine cdnas amplified from different t. aestivum and t. turgidum lines by piston et al.  <cit> , three cdnas from t. aestivum cv. cheyenne  <cit> , one from t. aestivum cv. chinese spring  <cit> , six from t. monococcum  <cit>  and one from t. turgidum subsp. durum × hordeum chilense.

because more than  <dig>  ests were generated from butte  <dig> developing grain as part of a large scale sequencing effort  <cit> , it was possible to evaluate the complement of gamma gliadins expressed in this cultivar by analysis of publicly available est data. in addition to eliminating the inherent bias that results from amplification of sequences by pcr, the analysis provides new information regarding the expression levels of the genes. the data demonstrate that there is differential expression of the many closely related members of the gamma gliadin gene family during grain development. based on the number of ests that comprise each of the contigs, the two most highly expressed gamma gliadins in butte  <dig> were # <dig> and # <dig>  it is interesting that the proteins encoded by contigs # <dig> and  <dig> cluster with the group ii gamma gliadins described by piston et al.  <cit>   that were found to be expressed at much higher levels than other groups of gliadins in the bread wheat cvs. anza and perico. the data also suggests that gamma gliadins that can be incorporated into the glutenin polymer are quite prevalent in butte  <dig>  four of the contigs from butte  <dig> encoded gamma gliadins that contained nine cysteines and at least two of these were expressed at moderate levels. this finding suggests that the ratio of different types of gamma gliadins could play a significant role in flour quality. it will be particularly interesting to determine whether gene expression correlates with protein accumulation in butte  <dig> grain. additionally, there is a need to determine the ratios of the two types of gamma gliadins in other cultivars. given the wealth of information contained in current est databases, careful analyses of ests from single cultivars could provide a better representation of expressed gamma gliadin genes as well as new information about their levels of expression.

the butte  <dig> ests are contained in several large assemblies that include sequences from many different cultivars and related wheat species. the analysis revealed that no single assembly included contigs encoding gamma gliadins that match perfectly with those encoded by all of the butte  <dig> contigs. this is not surprising given that the collections of ests and the assembly methods of the databases differ. additionally, gamma gliadins present unique challenges for est assembly because of the repetitiveness of their sequences. it is interesting that the assignment of individual ests to contigs by the us wheat genome project assembly was most consistent with the butte  <dig> assignments. however, consensus sequences frequently included stop codons or frameshifts in reading frames and only one full-length protein and one partial protein encoded by consensus sequences from this assembly were perfect matches with butte  <dig> sequences . while the harvest  <dig>  assembly included many of the same sequences as the us wheat genome project assembly, ests from six butte  <dig> gamma gliadin contigs were assigned to single contigs in this assembly and six of the full-length proteins and one partial protein encoded by the harvest  <dig>  consensus sequences were identical to butte  <dig> gamma gliadins. releases  <dig>  and  <dig>  of tagi include a much larger collection of ests. assignment of ests to contigs in tagi release  <dig>  was more consistent with the butte  <dig> assignments than in tagi release  <dig> , and more of the proteins encoded by the consensus sequences were identical to butte  <dig> full-length gamma gliadins. clearly, the complexity of the gliadin sequences demands that special attention be paid to the assembly of ests into contigs.

for proteomics studies aimed at distinguishing closely related gluten proteins, it is essential that the sequences of the complement of proteins expressed in a given cultivar are included in the database used for analysis of ms/ms data, so that spectral data will yield a maximum number of peptide identifications with high probabilities and cover a significant portion of the protein sequence. the specialized database constructed for analysis of ms/ms data contained more than  <dig>  million protein sequences, some of which were redundant. it is reassuring that six gamma gliadin proteins identified from flour by ms/ms with high levels of confidence correspond to butte  <dig> sequences. in our pilot study,  <dig> peptides with probabilities greater than 90% accounted for  <dig> % of butte  <dig> gamma gliadin # <dig>  nine of these peptides differ between gamma gliadin # <dig> and its closest match in ncbi,  . had the butte  <dig> sequences not been included in the database used for interrogation of ms/ms data, some spectra would not have yielded valid peptide identifications and sequence coverage of the protein would have been less than 20%. one of the moderately expressed gamma gliadins in butte  <dig>  differs from a protein in t. aestivum cv. yamhill  by only  <dig> amino acids. three of the  <dig> peptides identified by ms/ms included these amino acids. thus, inclusion of the butte  <dig> sequences in the database used for analysis of ms/ms data made it possible to distinguish proteins from the two cultivars.

distinguishing gamma gliadins that are likely to be monomeric proteins from those that contain an odd number of cysteine residues and are able to participate in the formation of glutenin polymers is far from trivial. muccilli et al.  <cit>  used maldi-tof to characterize proteins in lmw-gs fractions from the bread wheat cv. chinese spring and found a number of proteins with mws in the gamma gliadin range that had nine cysteine residues. ferrante et al.  <cit>  verified that a gene encoding a gamma gliadin with nine cysteines was expressed in durum wheat by first expressing the gene in e. coli. a protein from flour with similar mobility in 2-de to the e. coli protein was then selected, analyzed by ms/ms and showed good agreement with the protein encoded by the gene. this approach was successful in part because both the gene sequence and the identified protein were from the same durum cultivar. gobaa et al.  <cit>  concluded that a protein over-expressed in double haploid lines containing a 1bl.1rs translocation was a gamma gliadin containing nine cysteines. the identification of the protein was based on the best match of spectra from seven peptides to swiss-prot and ncbi non-redundant databases. however, none of the identified peptides contained the additional cysteine and only two of the reported peptides were perfect matches with , the gamma gliadin containing nine cysteines. for many proteins, a valid ms/ms identification can be obtained if at least two non-redundant peptides with 95% probability scores match a single entry in the database that is searched. however, in the case of gamma gliadins where many proteins differ by only a few amino acids, two peptides may not be sufficient to associate a protein with a specific gene sequence unless the peptides are from polymorphic regions. it is interesting that the two peptides from the gobaa et al.  <cit>  study that matched , qqqmn and tlptmcnvyv, are found in seven gamma gliadins from butte  <dig>  some of which contain eight cysteines and some of which contain nine cysteines. thus, it is difficult to say that the protein was a nine cysteine gamma gliadin without having identified a peptide containing the extra cysteine or having compared the spectral data to gamma gliadin sequences from the cultivar under study.

methods for ms/ms data analysis evolve rapidly. search algorithms that match the ms/ms spectra of peptides with protein sequence information from databases are constantly being improved. the use of multiple search engines also can increase the number of peptide identifications and the validity of protein identifications  <cit> . the choice of database to be searched is critical, particularly in organisms where a completely annotated genome sequence is not available. in addition, new sequences are constantly being added to gene and protein databases. indeed, since the work reported in this manuscript was initiated, several hundred new gamma gliadin sequences have been reported in the ncbi non-redundant database  <cit>  and the tagi assembly was updated to version  <dig>  that included over  <dig>  new sequences. in the end, careful interpretation of ms/ms data is essential for evaluating its biological significance. for protein groups as complex as the gamma gliadins, there is no question that detailed sequence information from the cultivar under study facilitates these efforts.

CONCLUSIONS
2-de and other analytical techniques can be used to separate and quantify gamma gliadins of interest in a particular study  <cit> . however, to be able to put the results from these studies into a biological context, it is necessary to distinguish very closely related proteins, some of which differ in the number of cysteine residues that are available for disulfide bond formation. the considerable heterogeneity observed within the gamma gliadin protein group suggests that it is important to have information about the complement of gamma gliadin genes expressed in the cultivar under study. undoubtedly, the identification of marker peptides for single gamma gliadin gene products from butte  <dig> will prove valuable in future quantitative studies aimed at comparing the levels of specific gamma gliadins in grain from plants grown under different environmental conditions.
