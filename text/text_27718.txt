BACKGROUND
pseudouridine  is an abundant modified nucleoside found in rna, at one time considered the fifth nucleoside of rna  <cit> . this modification has been found in many types of rna and is particularly abundant in small stable rnas such as transfer rna  and small nuclear rna   <cit> . because of its structure, with the carbon at the  <dig> position of the uracil ring attached to the sugar rather than the nitrogen at the  <dig> position, Ψ is potentially more versatile in its hydrogen bonding interactions  <cit> . the presence of Ψ appears to strengthen stems in rna secondary structures and to stabilize base stacking in loops  <cit> . the splicing of pre-messenger rnas  in xenopus oocytes is dependent on the presence of Ψ in u <dig> snrna  <cit> . this requirement for Ψ in u <dig> snrna was also seen in mammalian splicing extracts  <cit> . in addition, structural studies indicate that Ψ at a particular position in u <dig> snrna is necessary to obtain the proper conformation of the pre-mrna:u <dig> snrna interaction during splicing  <cit> . the presence of Ψ at position  <dig> in human u <dig> snrna enhances the formation of a splicing intermediate found when an rna oligonucleotide containing the lariat branch point of the pre-mrna is incubated with in vitro transcribed u <dig> and u <dig> snrna segments  <cit> .

the formation of Ψ is catalyzed by pseudouridine synthases after transcription and a number of site-specific synthases have been characterized from eukaryotes for the modification of trnas  <cit> . it has been shown that the pseudouridylation of several of the residues in metazoan snrnas require small nucleolar rna cofactors   <cit> . in yeast the formation of Ψ in u <dig> snrna is accomplished by a combination of site-specific Ψ synthases  <cit>  and a synthase that is rna cofactor dependent  <cit> .

the nucleotides that are modified to Ψ in the spliceosomal snrnas  have been completely mapped for two species of yeast  <cit>  and rat  <cit> . in addition, the modifications in several of the spliceosomal snrnas have been sequenced for other species such as fruit fly, frog, humans, and plants . the positions that are pseudouridylated are, for the most part, conserved and nearly all of the Ψs appear in the 5' half of the snrnas  <cit> . the systematic mapping of the sites of pseudouridylation on these essential splicing cofactors has not been attempted for one of the most popular model systems currently used in biology, caenorhabditis elegans . this is especially surprising given the fact that cis-splicing in c. elegans exhibits a number of differences from other species. for example, there is a highly conserved 3' acceptor site and a lack of an identified lariat branch point consensus sequence within introns  <cit> .

in this report we present the results of the mapping of the sites of Ψ modification on the spliceosomal snrnas of c. elegans, the first step in a larger endeavor to determine the factors required for the formation of Ψ in worms and the function of these modifications in an animal model of development. all of the c. elegans spliceosomal snrnas contain Ψ, which distinguishes these results from those seen with the snrnas from two yeast species  <cit> . c. elegans u <dig> snrna is the most highly modified with a total of nine Ψs, all in the first  <dig> nucleotides of the snrna. u <dig> snrna has three Ψ residues in the highly conserved stem-loop known to be essential for pre-mrna splicing. c. elegans u <dig> snrna has two Ψs, with one in a region of the snrna that participates in an rna-rna interaction with u <dig> snrna and allows for the formation of the u4/u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle . u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas each have one Ψ identified. when the sites of modification are compared with snrnas sequenced from other species, two of the positions modified on c. elegans snrnas are unique, one at position  <dig> on u <dig> snrna and one at position  <dig> on u <dig> snrna. these modifications are in regions of each snrna that are predicted to interact with u <dig> snrna to form the u4/u <dig> snrnp or in the spliceosome during the removal of introns from pre-mrna  <cit> .

RESULTS
a primer extension method  <cit>  was used to identify the positions of Ψ in the snrnas. the method involves chemically treating the total rna from wild type worms with 1-cyclohexyl- <dig> carbodi-imide metho-p-toluenesulphonate  which covalently reacts with uridines, and other nucleotides, whether modified or not. two concentrations of cmct were used in the reactions and the reaction was allowed to proceed such that only a portion of the available uridines is covalently modified. this partial reaction is important since it is essential to be able to extend the primer past the first Ψ encountered in order to identify additional Ψs. the isolated total rna is then treated with mild base, and as a consequence only the Ψ residues are left covalently modified. this covalent modification of Ψ creates a stop to reverse transcriptase  progression during the specific primer extension phase of the assay. the products are electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide/ <dig>  m urea gel along with sequencing lanes using the same end-labeled primer. when bands appear in the cmct+ lanes but not in the cmct- lanes and those bands are just prior to a uridine in the sequence, then there is a Ψ at that position.

nearly all of the Ψ residues that have been mapped on any snrna of any species are found in the 5' half of the rna  <cit> , the exceptions being one residue found near the 3' end of u <dig> snrna  and two residues that are found at positions  <dig> and  <dig> on drosophila u <dig> snrna. therefore this primer extension technique  <cit>  can be used to determine the modification state of all but the very 3'  <dig> nucleotides of the snrna. to map the positions of Ψ on c. elegans snrnas, primers that hybridized to the extreme 3' end of each snrna were used initially. three additional primers were used to map sites of modification on u <dig> snrna, and two additional primers were used to map u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig> snrnas. only one additional primer was used to map modifications on u <dig> snrna.

u <dig> snrna
with u <dig> snrna, only one nucleotide, at the position shown in figure 1a, was found to be converted into Ψ. this modification is at position  <dig> of the thomas et al.  <cit>  c. elegans numbering system for u <dig> snrna. with the primer extension assay used in these experiments  <cit> , the reverse transcriptase  stops just before the nucleotide that is a Ψ, which is covalently modified by the cmct. in the case of c. elegans u <dig> snrna, there is a band before the u at position  <dig> and not position  <dig>  and therefore position  <dig> is modified and position  <dig> is not. the reason for the presence of the double band in the cmct treated lanes is not known but it has been seen in other substrates by other investigators  <cit> . other assays of u <dig> snrna using this same primer with a separately isolated total rna sample and electrophoresed on a different gel also showed this double band. we have noted a double band similar to this previously when Ψ was mapped on c. elegans trnaala  at a position where there was only one uridine  <cit> . two primers were used in the primer extension reactions, with one hybridizing to the extreme 3' end of the u <dig> snrna  and one closer to the 5' end . the modification shown in fig. 1a was mapped with this latter primer and u1reva yielded no additional Ψ residues .

u <dig> snrna
u <dig> snrnas from other species that have been sequenced have from zero to five Ψs  <cit> . two Ψs were identified on c. elegans u <dig> snrna mapped with the u4revb primer . they occur at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  with stops to rt appearing in the cmct treated lanes of the gel. pseudouridines have been found at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in all vertebrate u <dig> snrnas sequenced, but no other u <dig> snrna sequenced has a Ψ at position  <dig>  <cit> . the possible modifications of the uridine at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of c. elegans u <dig> snrna, slightly obscured in a region of stops to rt progression even in the cmct- lane, are marked on the figure. however, the use of additional primers in the assay has not confirmed Ψs at these positions . with this specific primer extension method  <cit>  there is a possibility of misidentifying Ψs  <cit> , so since this is a region of considerable secondary structure, the conservative interpretation of the data was that there are no Ψs at these sites. no modification of uridines near the 5' end of c. elegans u <dig> snrna, such as at position  <dig> , was observed with this or another primer , that is closer to the 5' end of the u <dig> snrna .

u <dig> snrna
as with other u <dig> snrnas that have been mapped for modifications  <cit> , c. elegans u <dig> snrna has the largest number of Ψs in the spliceosomal snrnas. in a previous report of the characterization of pseudouridine synthase  <dig> in c. elegans , we mapped at least five Ψ residues in c. elegans u <dig> snrna at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  using a primer  close to the middle of the snrna  <cit> . when another primer  was used instead, two additional modifications, at positions  <dig> and  <dig> were seen , but the modification at position  <dig> was not detected. when the assay was repeated using the u2revc primer used in the earlier report, the modification at position  <dig> was not detected . in fig.  <dig>  and the other figures, the arrowheads on the left of the panels denote positions just before a u residue where bands occur in both cmct+ lanes but are missing or greatly diminished in the cmct- lane. additional modifications were mapped to positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  of u <dig> snrna when a primer closer to the 5' end of the rna  was used. three new primers were used to map the Ψ residues on u <dig> snrnas in this report and the primer hybridizing to the extreme 3' end of the rna  did not add any additional pseudouridylated positions to the ones identified with the u2revb-d primers. this brings the total number of Ψ residues in c. elegans u <dig> snrna to nine. surprisingly, no Ψ was detected in c. elegans u <dig> snrna at the position equivalent to  <dig> in vertebrates , even though a Ψ is found at this position in all other u <dig> snrnas where the modifications have been determined  <cit> . this same result was seen with two different primers, there is no increase in band intensity in the cmct treated lanes, which would indicate a stop to rt and therefore a Ψ .

u <dig> snrna
in many of the u <dig> snrnas that have been sequenced there are several Ψ residues in the region of the terminal loop of the large stem-loop   <cit> . even yeast  has two modifications in this region  <cit> , a portion of u <dig> snrna that has been shown to be critical for the function of this splicing factor  <cit> . in the u <dig> snrnas where Ψs have been found, there is a Ψ at position  <dig> and most have an additional one at position  <dig> . c. elegans has three Ψ residues in this loop region and the result with the u5revb primer is shown in fig. 3a. there are two Ψs at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in c. elegans u <dig> snrna numbering, which correspond to positions  <dig> and  <dig> in vertebrates. the third Ψ, shown at position  <dig> in fig. 3a, is in the stem at a position that it shares with several other species, including the pea, but not with vertebrates or with either s. pombe or s. cerevisiae .

u <dig> snrna
one Ψ was mapped on u <dig> snrna from c. elegans at position  <dig> , which is equivalent to position  <dig> in the vertebrate u <dig> snrna numbering system. this position is modified in mammals but not in either yeast u <dig> snrna mapped  <cit> . a second primer  was used to confirm the lack of modification at position  <dig>  which corresponds to a Ψ in mammalian u <dig> snrna . based on the sequences of other u <dig> snrnas  <cit>  there is a possibility that there might be another Ψ residue close to the 3' end of the c. elegans u <dig> snrna . since even the most 3' primer we used in these assays would hybridize to this position, we were not able to determine if worm u <dig> snrna has this modification using this technique.

cepus1p knockout
in yeast, pus1p modifies one position on u <dig> snrna  <cit> , but when total rna from cepus1p knockout worms  was used as template for the primer extensions with u1revb, u5revc, and u6revc primers there was no difference in the Ψ modification pattern seen with wild type  and vc <dig> rna . this result was also seen with u <dig> snrna from vc <dig> worms, and was reported previously  <cit> .

discussion
in all the snrnas that have been sequenced and the modifications determined, u <dig> snrna has by far the most Ψs. c. elegans u <dig> snrna has nine, less than the number seen with vertebrates and flowering plants but greater than the number seen with either s. pombe or s. cerevisiae  <cit> . the overall modification pattern seen with c. elegans u <dig> snrna is unique, and there is one position that is modified to Ψ that is not found in the u <dig> snrnas from other species . the other eight modifications were found at sites that have previously been identified as sites of pseudouridylation in u <dig> snrna and two  have been found in all u <dig> snrnas mapped  <cit> . these modifications have been implicated in the function of the pre-mrna splicing cofactor  <cit> . it was shown by an in vitro reconstitution system for pre-mrna splicing that the modified u <dig> snrna reconstituted splicing but u <dig> snrna without Ψs did not  <cit> . in addition, modifications at the 5' end of u <dig> snrna were shown to be necessary for the cofactor's activity in the reconstitution of pre-mrna splicing in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . using this same system, zhao and yu  <cit>  have recently shown that the presence of Ψ in the region of u <dig> snrna  that interacts with the pre-mrna lariat branch point is required for function of the cofactor and for the formation of the active 17s u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle .

the 'branch point interacting region' of u <dig> snrna is highly pseudouridylated, with six modifications in vertebrates and v. faba, five in s. pombe and  <dig> in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . all of these species have u <dig> snrnas that have Ψ at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  c. elegans also has five Ψs in this region, and although there are Ψs at positions equivalent to  <dig> and  <dig>  we were unable to detect a modification at the position equivalent to  <dig> . the sequence of this region is highly conserved  <cit> , and so even though there is a uridine at position  <dig> in the u <dig> snrna from c. elegans, it does not appear to be converted to Ψ. this is a surprising result given the importance attached to the presence of Ψ at this position. it is the nucleotide that is predicted to be directly across from the bulged adenosine in the helix formed by u <dig> snrna and pre-mrna in mammalian and yeast splicing mechanisms  <cit> . newby and greenbaum have shown that the presence of Ψ at this position stabilizes the bulged adenosine conformation in oligomers, which is predicted to be favorable for splicing  <cit> . in addition, valadkhan and manley have shown that in vitro, a Ψ at position  <dig> in u <dig> snrna enhances the formation of a putative splicing intermediate between u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas  <cit> . it has been shown recently that when the loss of pseudouridine synthase  <dig> , responsible for Ψ <dig> in s. cerevisiae u <dig> snrna , is coupled with the mutation of position  <dig> in u <dig> snrna , a synthetic growth defect is seen. neither the loss of pus7p nor either mutation at position  <dig>  showed a phenotype alone. this suggests there is a requirement for the Ψ at position  <dig> under certain conditions  <cit> .

how is it that worms can do without Ψ at this position? it is possible our assays were incapable of detecting Ψ at this particular position in c. elegans u <dig> snrna with the primers that we have used. but we think this is unlikely since we identify Ψs on either side of position  <dig>  it is a formal possibility that cmct does not react with this particular Ψ in worm u <dig> snrna and therefore would not result in a stop to rt, but we believe this is also unlikely. instead an answer might be found in the differences in consensus sequences seen with c. elegans introns. there is no identified lariat branch point consensus sequence in c. elegans introns and the consensus sequence at the 3' acceptor site is extended and highly conserved  <cit> . since there is no branch point consensus in worms, there may be no requirement for a Ψ at position  <dig> in c. elegans u <dig> snrna. in c. elegans u <dig> snrnp may be more closely associated with the 3' splice site since it has been found that the u <dig> associated factor  is associated with this region of the intron rather than the lariat branch point  <cit> .

although c. elegans u <dig> snrna does not appear to have a Ψ at position  <dig> it does have a Ψ at position  <dig>  a modification that occurs in no other sequenced u <dig> snrna  <cit> . this position is significant since it is in a region of c. elegans u <dig> snrna that is predicted to interact with u <dig> snrna in the active spliceosome . the addition of an a-Ψ base pair would add stability to the inter-rna stem and may favor the adoption of a particular conformation in the u <dig> or u <dig> snrna that would promote catalytic function  <cit> . it is possible that this modification is critical due to the lack of an extensive lariat branch point interaction between u <dig> snrna and the pre-mrna in c. elegans  <cit> .

of the spliceosomal snrnas, the modifications on u <dig> snrna have been determined from the largest number of species  <cit> . one position  is converted to Ψ in all of the u <dig> snrnas where Ψ has been found . in addition, many u <dig> snrnas, c. elegans u <dig> snrna included, also have a Ψ at position  <dig> . the nucleotide sequence in the loop is highly conserved and is critical for the function of u <dig> snrna in the splicing of pre-mrna  <cit> . however, the position of Ψ in the stem is not highly conserved, except for a tendency to be located near the ends of the stem . in trnas, Ψs located at the ends of stems are thought to stabilize base-pairing and therefore strengthen the stem  <cit> . this could be the reason the actual position is not conserved, only the presence of the Ψ in the stem. interestingly, s. cerevisiae u <dig> snrna does not have a Ψ in the stem, only at position  <dig> in the loop. this yeast has a u <dig> snrna that can be folded into a different structure from the other u <dig> snrnas  <cit> . it has an additional stem loop that could have a stabilizing effect on the stem-loop shown in fig.  <dig>  thereby abrogating the need for the presence of Ψ in the stem in u <dig> snrna of s. cerevisiae.

c. elegans u <dig> snrna has two uridines at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  in this region of u <dig> snrna that is essential for the function of the splicing factor, but only the uridine at position  <dig> is converted to Ψ. many species, including vertebrates, drosophila, and s. cerevisiae, also have two uridines at these positions but both are converted to Ψ. however, algae and s. pombe u <dig> snrnas have two uridines, and Ψ appears only at the position nearest the 5' end of the rna  <cit> .

s. pombe, and s. cerevisiae u <dig> snrnas have no detectable Ψs  <cit> , whereas vertebrates, drosophila, and v. faba , all have several Ψs in their u <dig> snrnas  <cit> . one of the three Ψs found in rat u <dig> snrna  is in a portion of u <dig> snrna that is predicted to interact with u <dig> snrna, suggesting the presence of Ψ in this region of u <dig> snrna could strengthen the interaction. an equivalent Ψ is not present in c. elegans u <dig> snrna but the Ψ at position  <dig>  a Ψ that is found in no other sequenced u <dig> snrna, is in an area that is predicted to participate in a second intermolecular hybridization with c. elegans u <dig> snrna . this a-Ψ base pair is in the middle of three g-u base pairs and so would lend greater stability to the stem formed by u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas. this same snrna-snrna interaction is predicted to have only one g-u base pair with mammalian u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas  <cit> . the a residue in c. elegans u <dig> snrna that the Ψ at position  <dig> of u <dig> snrna pairs with is the same residue that is predicted to base pair with the Ψ  <dig> of u <dig> snrna , providing evidence of the need to strengthen each of the snrna-snrna interactions that involve this region of u <dig> snrna.

CONCLUSIONS
the total number of Ψs found in the snrnas of c. elegans is significantly higher than the minimal amount found in yeasts but it is lower than that seen in sequenced vertebrate snrnas. when the actual sites of modification on c. elegans snrnas are compared with other sequenced snrnas most of the positions correspond to modifications found in other species. however, two of the positions modified on c. elegans snrnas are unique, one at position  <dig> on u <dig> snrna and one at position  <dig> on u <dig> snrna. both of these modifications are in regions of these snrnas that interact with u <dig> snrna either in the spliceosome or in the u4/u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle . these Ψs and may be involved in strengthening the intermolecular association of the snrnas.

the determination of the Ψ residues in the spliceosomal snrnas of c. elegans will speed the identification of enzymes and cofactors that are involved in the modification of these uridine residues. the location of the modifications will also help in the identification of those cofactors by providing sequences that can be used to predict guide sequences in the snornas. once we can identify cofactors we will be able to use the powerful genetics of c. elegans to mutate the cofactors and affect the formation of Ψ at any position in the snrnas, especially those that might be critical for the function of the splicing cofactors.
