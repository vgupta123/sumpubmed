BACKGROUND
lentiviral vectors  are versatile tools for molecular medicine and gene therapy  <cit> . they are able to integrate their viral genome into both dividing and non-dividing cells  <cit> . most lvs presently used are based on the human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig> , which is the most extensively studied lentivirus  <cit> . in addition, lentivectors have been derived from a variety of other lentiviruses   <cit> .

lenti- as well as spuma- and oncoretroviruses belong to the large family of retroviridae  <cit> . retroviruses are - besides adenoviruses - the most widely used vectors in gene therapy clinical trials . they were also the first vectors that have been applied in gene therapy. most oncoretroviral vectors are based on the moloney murine leukemia virus   <cit> . the wild type momlv and retroviral vectors carrying the original momlv envelope proteins transduce only cells that express the ecotropic receptor, i. e. rodent cells  <cit> . however, oncoretroviral vectors are sensitive to environmental conditions and lose their infectivity relatively quickly  <cit>  resulting in a loss of infectious particles  during purification  <cit> . lenti- as well as retroviral vectors can also be pseudotyped with different envelope proteins from other viruses resulting in different characteristics of the vectors, either regarding their surface charge, physical stability and/or biological activity  <cit> . pseudotyping of lvs or oncoretroviral vectors with vsv.g broadens the host range by enabling them to enter the cells via receptor mediated endocytosis  <cit> . furthermore, vsv.g-pseudotyped viral vectors were shown to be more stable and can be concentrated by ultracentrifugation  without a significant loss in titer  <cit> .

the most commonly used retro- as well as lentiviral vector systems are based on a split genome approach that provides the viral genes necessary in trans for production of viral particles in the helper/packaging cells  <cit> . the viral particles are released into the cell culture supernatant  and can be easily harvested without need to disrupt the cells. presently, the most common method to concentrate these viral particles from cell culture sn is uc  <cit> . in addition, different methods have been studied to purify lenti- and retroviral vectors including chromatography, ultrafiltration  and coprecipitation with salts and/or polymers  <cit> .

here, we analyzed a purification system  that combines membrane adsorption and uf for the concentration of vsv.g pseudotyped lenti- as well as retroviral particles. the method used is based on binding of the viral particles to an anionic exchange membrane adsorber  followed by uf of the eluted purified particles. different volumes of cell culture sn, up to  <dig>  ml, can be purified and the resulting recovery rates are reproducible and comparable to those achieved by uc. furthermore, the method was also successfully applied for the purification of lentiviral particles without envelope proteins and retroviral particles with an ecotropic envelope, demonstrating the broad range of this application.

RESULTS
purification of lentiviral particles by using membrane adsorbers
for purification of lvs, we initially focused on vsv.g pseudotyped lentiviral particles, because they are the most widely applied type of lentivectors. we used hiv-derived lvs carrying a cmv promoter-driven egfp expression cassette  <cit>  . viral particles were generated by transient transfection of hek 293t cells. the cell culture sn was harvested and applied to anionic exchange mas  to bind and enrich for virus particles. samples of each purification step were then analyzed to quantify the amount of ips by transduction of hek 293t cells and facs analysis.

after loading of the lentiviral particles to the ma and washing, retained viral particles were eluted with high salt elution buffer . given the potential detrimental effect of high salt on the functionality of the viral particles, we investigated the impact of the hypertonic environment on viral infectivity. incubation of the eluted lvs in the high salt buffer for one hour on ice resulted in a significant reduction of infectivity by  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. within  <dig> hours  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of ips were lost . to prevent loss of infectivity a buffer exchange step was included to recover the viral particles in a buffer with physiological salt concentration ). buffer exchange as well as further concentration of the viral particles was achieved by using uf columns. the membranes of these columns have pores of distinct size that can retain viral particles, whereas smaller molecules and particle fragments can pass through the pores. vivaspin <dig> uf units with  <dig> k or  <dig> k mwcos were compared that can accommodate up to  <dig> ml of ma eluate . in both cases, only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the viral particles were detected in the flowthrough. although uf units with a mwco of  <dig> k require less centrifugation time than the  <dig> k units due to the larger pore size , the  <dig> k unit showed significant higher recovery of the viral particles . in summary, the vivaspin <dig> uf unit with a mwco of  <dig> k is suitable for rebuffering, purifying as well as concentrating of the lentiviral particles after elution from the ma.

purification of lentiviral particles from small starting volumes
importantly, the use of anionic exchange mas should allow for the purification of lentiviral particles from small as well as large starting volumes. first, we tested a small volume system , which can be used for up to  <dig> ml starting solution. the viruses are eluted by applying  <dig> ml elution buffer. starting with  <dig>  ×  <dig> ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> ips in the cell culture sn  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the viral particles applied were recovered from the ma . approximately  <dig> and 9% of virus was lost in the flowthrough and the wash fraction, respectively . subsequently, the eluate was loaded on the uf unit and the final volume of the retentate was adjusted to ~ <dig> μl . overall, the final recovery rate of the small volume ma/uf combination was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % with  <dig>  ×  <dig> ips in the concentrate . hence, a  <dig>  fold concentration was achieved with the ma and a further  <dig> fold concentration was obtained by uf . taken together, the combination of anion exchange resin and uf unit resulted in a  <dig> fold enrichment of lentiviral particles from cell culture sn to concentrate. high enrichment was also seen in westernblot analysis by using antibody against the lentiviral capsid protein p <dig> .

to compare the method presented here with a standard procedure, we used a well established uc protocol  <cit>  consisting of an initial centrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> h, followed by loading the resuspended viruses on a sucrose cushion. after a second spin at  <dig>  g for  <dig> h, the viral precipitate was resuspended in ~ <dig> μl hbss. starting initially with  <dig>  ×  <dig> ips in the cell culture sn  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the ips were recovered by uc , which is not significantly different from the recovery rate obtained by use of the ma/uf combination .

purification of lentiviral particles from large starting volumes
next, we tested whether larger volumes of cell culture sns can be processed with mas. for this purpose, we used a larger ma  that can accommodate up to  <dig> ml starting volume. using this ma/uf setup  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  of the lvs were finally recovered from the cell culture sn . this corresponds to a  <dig> fold enrichment of viral particles in the concentrate compared to the starting solution. considering the differences in the reduction in volume from sn to concentrate for the small and the large ma, the overall enrichments are not significant different.

using uc to purify viral particles from the same starting volume of  <dig> ml of sn, a recovery rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % was achieved . again, no significant difference between the recovery rates obtained by the use of ma/uf setup and uc was observed .

it should be noted that for such large volumes uc is a time-consuming procedure, because multiple centrifugation runs are necessary due to the limited capacity of the rotors. for  <dig> ml cell culture sn the standard uc protocol requires overall  <dig> runs each lasting  <dig> hours . in contrast, loading, washing and elution of the mas and subsequent uf requires only around  <dig> h.

to test whether two large ma units can be serially connected for further upscaling, we directly coupled two units. to evaluate the efficiency of the serial ma set-up,  <dig>  ml of cell culture sn were prepared and  <dig>  ml were loaded on two serially connected mas and  <dig> ml were loaded on a single ma. the flowthrough was collected stepwise in  <dig> ml fractions and the biological titer  was determined, respectively . the two set-ups showed increasing concentrations of viral vectors in consecutive flowthrough fractions. for the single ma around 10% of the initial viral load was in the flowthrough after adding approximately  <dig> ml of cell culture sn onto the ma . similarly, for the two coupled mas 10% of the loaded viral particles were found in the flowthrough after application of  <dig> ml of starting volume . thus, the maximal loading volume is ~ <dig> ml and ~ <dig>  ml for one unit and for two coupled units, respectively. in summary, a serial connection of two large mas can be used to increase the volume of loading material to up to  <dig>  ml of cell culture sn. purification of  <dig>  ml of cell culture sn with a two-ma-setup and uf  resulted in a recovery rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, displaying an enrichment of almost  <dig> fold from starting volume to concentrate . this is comparable to the enrichments achieved by the purification of smaller sn volumes  with ma/uf considering the reduction in volume from sn to concentrate.

analysis of the purified lentiviral vectors
in order to analyze viral particle morphology and integrity, we applied electron microscopy. the size and appearance of particles purified by ma/uf were not different from those particles obtained by uc .

a further parameter to compare different purification methods is the ratio of biological versus physical titer. this ratio indicates the percentage of viral particles that are actually infectious as compared to the overall viral particles . we determined the biological titer by facs analysis of transduced cells. the physical titer  was quantified by two methods that measure different constituents of the particles, i.e. the lentiviral capsid protein p <dig> or the viral genome as measured with quantitative realtime pcr . we analyzed the ratio of the biological and the physical titer of lv preparations derived from purifications using either ma/uf or uc with different starting volumes . overall the ip/vp ratios were higher for the low volume preparations independently of the purification method used and ca.  <dig> - 20% of the particles purified from low volumes were biologically active, whereas only  <dig> - 9% purified from larger volumes were infectious. these ratios are in the same range or even higher than those found in the literature where ratios between  <dig>  to 1% were observed  <cit> .

comparison of the two purification methods revealed also considerable variations: the ip/vp ratios for uc are in the range of  <dig> - 20% and  <dig> - 13% for p <dig> and qrtpcr method, respectively. for ma/uf the ip/vp lies in the range of  <dig> - 6% and  <dig> - 5% for p <dig> and qrtpcr, respectively. statistical analysis of the qrtpcr data showed that at high volumes there is a significant difference between ma/uf and uc, but there is no significant difference between the two purification methods at low volumes . in contrast, the p <dig> data showed no significant difference between ma/uf and uc after purifying large volumes and significant difference between the two purification methods at low volumes . thus, there is a considerable variation and even conflicting results between the different assay methods available for the quantification of the physical titer . nevertheless, one can conclude that the ip/vp ratios for both uc and ma/uf are in the same range. both methods exhibited a similar efficacy in purifying biologically active viruses  with a tendency of higher ip/vp ratios after uc purification.

the purity of lv preparations is an important issue, especially in clinical applications. therefore, we analyzed ma/uf preparations for their protein  and dna content . use of dmem with fcs for culturing the packaging cells resulted in a high concentration of proteins in the sn as well as in the concentrate presumably due to presence of serum proteins especially albumin . next, we tested whether serum free medium can be used for purification of lv containing sn. two different serum-free media  were tested. these media clearly resulted in a reduction of protein concentration in the sn with hyclone sfm4megavir leading to the highest reduction of protein carry-over in the concentrate . the ips applied to the protein gel were in the same range  indicating that use of serum free medium does not influence the lv infectivity. thus, cultivation of producer cells after transfection can be performed with serum free medium if reduction of the protein content of the lv preparations is desired.

to determine dna contaminations in the concentrate, we analyzed samples from lv purifications on an agarose gel with and without treatment with benzonase   <cit> . without treatment with benzonase  high concentrations of dna were present in the lv concentrates. in contrast, benzonase pretreatment of the sn efficiently reduces the dna content . the biological titers of the concentrates obtained with the two purifications were in the same range , indicating that benzonase treatment does not impair the biological activity of the lvs.

concentration of non-vsv.g pseudotyped lentiviral vectors
presently, most lvs used are pseudotyped with vsv.g, mainly due to its broad host range, high infectious titers and stability during uc  <cit> . nevertheless, for some applications other envelope proteins are required  <cit> . furthermore, toxicity of vsv.g pseudotyped vectors as well as an induction of immune response upon systemic administration has been observed  <cit> .

therefore, we tested whether the vsv.g envelope is required for purification with the ma system. cell culture sns containing viral particles either with vsv.g envelope or without envelope were each purified with the small ma/uf system and samples were analyzed by p24-elisa . similar titers in the sn  and nearly no viral particles were found in the flowthrough in both cases. although significant higher titers were obtained with vsv.g pseudotyped viral particles, this experiment clearly shows that vsv.g is not required for binding to the adsorber material.

purification of oncoretroviral vectors
retroviral vectors have been established from different retroviruses. they play an important role in gene therapy  <cit> . among the retroviruses, oncoretroviruses represent presently the most commonly used vector type. therefore, we tested whether the ma system can also be applied for the purification of oncoretroviral vectors. we used momlv-derived vectors containing an egfp expression cassette under control of the momlv-ltr   <cit> . in initial experiments, vsv.g pseudotyped retroviral as well as vsv.g pseudotyped lentiviral particles were purified in parallel using  <dig> ml of cell culture sn and the small ma/uf combination, respectively. the recovery rate for the vsv.g pseudotyped retrovirus as analyzed by facs was almost 30%  demonstrating the utility of the ma system also for this vector system.

although retroviruses that carry the ecotropic envelope have a narrow host range, this type of vector is also widely used  <cit> . therefore, we tested the ma/uf setup for the purification of  <dig> ml cell culture sn containing ecotropic oncoretroviral vectors. for comparison, we additionally analyzed oncoretroviral vectors with vsv.g envelope. samples were analyzed using a c-type rt activity kit . in the elution fraction  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the vsv.g pseudotyped particles and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the retroviral particles with ecotropic envelope were recovered, respectively. after the uf, the recovery rate of the ecotropic virus was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % whereas  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the initially applied vsv.g pseudotyped particles were detected in the concentrate.

in summary, these data indicate that vsv.g is not necessary for binding to the ma and that also purification of viral particles pseudotyped with other envelope proteins is possible. although binding to the adsorber works best with vsv.g envelope, these results demonstrate the broad application spectrum of the ma/uf system presented in this study.

discussion
here, we describe a method for purification and concentration of lentiviral as well as oncoretroviral particles. due to their capability of integrating their rna after reverse transcription into the host genome, recombinant retroviral vectors are versatile tools in a broad spectrum of applications. lvs have become a convenient alternative to oncoretroviral vectors, because of their ability to transduce dividing as well as non-dividing cells.

presently, the most common way of concentrating vsv.g pseudotyped viral vectors is uc. however, purification methods based on uc are difficult to scale up and time-consuming due to the limited capacity of the centrifuges. furthermore, impurities having a similar density as the viral particles  are coprecipitated during the centrifugation steps  <cit> . alternatively, chromatography can be applied for vector concentration, including affinity chromatography, anion exchange and size exclusion. chromatography is a very useful procedure to separate macromolecules like dna, proteins and also viral vectors. but many chromatographic media are inapplicable because of the relatively labile nature of lenti- and retroviral vectors  <cit> . affinity chromatography strategies are based on streptavidin-biotin interaction  <cit> , heparin binding  <cit>  and immobilized metal affinity  <cit> . in anionic exchange chromatography the negatively charged viral vectors bind to the positively charged chromatographic material. bound virus can be then eluted by high salt buffer  <cit> . elution with high salt buffers significantly reduces the infectivity of viral vectors, very likely due to an increase in osmotic pressure and a subsequent damage of the viral membrane. we found that only one hour of exposure to high salt  on ice is enough to inactivate  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the lvs . others observed a reduction by 50% of infectious retroviral particles when exposed to high salt for one hour at room temperature  <cit> . therefore, further purification steps are necessary  <cit> . however, anionic exchange requires no modification of the viral vectors such as biotinylation or his-tagging and is fast, versatile and easy to scale up  <cit> . several anion-exchange chromatographic matrices have already been investigated with different binding capacities for retroviral particles  <cit> . another chromatographic procedure is size exclusion. although it is a very powerful separation method, it is mainly applied as a polishing step due to difficulties in up-scaling and a low throughput  <cit> . another way to purify lenti- and retroviral vectors is uf through membranes with various pore sizes . although uf is a fast and simple purification method, an undesirable side effect is concentration of macromolecules derived from cell debris  <cit> . further alternatives for purifying lenti- and retroviral particles are precipitation with salt buffers  and/or polymers . but this method has the disadvantage that the salts and polymers as well as impurities  are co-sedimented and therefore, additional purification steps are often necessary. furthermore, this method has a low selectivity and is difficult to scale up  <cit> .

here, we used a combination of anionic exchange and uf for the purification of vsv.g pseudotyped lenti- and retroviral particles. the virus was bound to the cationic membrane by loading the cell culture sn to the ma. elution of the viral particles was achieved by application of high salt buffer. however, due to toxic effects of salt buffers with high molarity  <cit>  subsequent rebuffering is necessary. we used uf units for desalting and concentration, leading to high titer lv preparations with a biological titer in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> ip/ml.

mas of different capacity were applied to purify  <dig> ml and  <dig> ml of cell culture sn, respectively. the number of infectious lentiviral particles obtained in the concentrates after ma/uf was similar or even higher as compared to preparations purified with uc of the same starting volume . importantly, the ma/uf system allows for purification of up to  <dig>  ml of starting volume containing lvs by a serial coupling of two large mas and final uf. furthermore, the mas used in our study can be connected to fplc . this enables an automation of the purification procedure as well as monitoring of different parameters like uv extinction or conductivity.

for use of lvs in clinical trials , high titer vector preparations are needed that can be reproducibly obtained at large scale. impurities that derive from transfection and cell debris of producer cells as well as medium components should be minimized in the lv preparations for such applications. in addition, some primary cells  have been shown to be sensitive to toxic effects of fcs components supplemented in the medium  <cit> . in this context it is of interest that we observed a clear reduction of protein and dna contaminants by use of serum free medium and after treatment of cell culture sn with benzonase, respectively   <cit> .

another important property of lv preparations is the ratio of infectious vs. total viral particles. overall, we observed that between  <dig> and 20% of the purified particles were biologically active, which is similar or even better than already published ip/vp ratios   <cit> . these differences might be due to various protocols for lv preparation and purification procedures as well as cell lines and constructs used.

different set ups for the cultivation of the adherent hek 293t packaging cells have been described in the combination with mas. for example kutner et al published a combination of multilayered flasks with a gas permeable growth surface  and anionic exchange chromatography  <cit> . cultivation of the packaging cells in the hyperflask vessels, instead of conventional cell culture dishes, resulted in  <dig> fold increased lv production  <cit> . furthermore, lv generation of cells in suspension culture were recently analyzed by lesch et al to facilitate a scalable lv preparation for gene therapy applications  <cit> . for this purpose, baculovirus based lv production of suspension cells was used for transduction of the packaging cells with the lentivector/packaging plasmids instead of the commonly applied transfection of adherent cells by calciumphosphate. however, in order to remove the baculoviruses a purification step had to be included  <cit> .

it remains to be shown that these systems can also be used for particles carrying different envelopes and for vectors derived from oncoretroviruses.

an outstanding feature of the purification method described herein is that it can be applied for the purification of lenti- as well as oncoretroviral vectors. although a direct comparison between viral vectors derived from different members of the retrovirus family is not feasible , the recovery rates obtained with the vsv.g pseudotyped retrovirus is in the similar range as the recovery of vsv.g pseudotyped lentiviruses.

in addition, viral particles pseudotyped with different envelopes can be purified, which broadens the spectrum of possible applications considerably. apart from vsv.g also other glycoproteins were shown to be useful for pseudotyping lentiviral particles including envelope proteins from ross river virus, semliki forest virus, mokola virus or rabies virus  <cit> . initially, we showed that purification of lvs is possible even without any envelope protein showing that the presence of vsv.g is not a perquisite for lv purification and opening the possibility of alternative pseudotyping. in this context is of interest that the ma/uf system can also be used to purify viral particles carrying an ecotropic envelope. however, purification of the oncoretroviral particles with vsv.g pseudotyping resulted in a significant higher recovery rate compared to ecotropic envelope protein. this difference might be due to reduced stability of ecotropic pseudotyped viral particles  <cit> . in general, the lenti- and retrovirus stability depends not only on the particular envelope protein but also on the producer cell line type from which the viral lipid envelope was derived  <cit>  and other factors like buffers, ph, shear forces, temperature and especially presence of high salt concentrations  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the ma/uf method described here is a versatile way to purify high titer lentiviral as well as oncoretroviral particles starting from small and large volumes. with the mas described a broad range of starting volumes up to one liter of virus supernatant can be rapidly processed. importantly, even at large scale/higher input volumes the method yields reproducibly high virus titers. furthermore, the procedure is easy to handle and can even be connected to an automated purification system such as fplc allowing for monitoring accurate salt gradient elution, which is an important factor for further use in a clinical setting. in contrast to the widely used uc method, no expensive equipment like ultracentrifuges are needed.

importantly, this method can be used for vectors derived from different members of the large family of retroviruses independently of the envelope  used. taken together, the ma/uf combination described in this study offers a flexible and rapid way to purify lentiviral particles as well as oncoretroviral vectors with different pseudotypes from a broad range of starting volumes at reproducibly high titers.
