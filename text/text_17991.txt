BACKGROUND
ultra conserved regions  are a class of noncoding sequences discovered in  <dig> by bejerano and colleagues  <cit> . the ucrs are located in both intra- and inter-genic regions and 53% of them are nonexonic, whereas the remaining 47% are either overlapping mrnas or possibly exonic. since ucrs represent a group of  <dig> sequences  that are 100% conserved among orthologous regions of human, mouse, and rat genomes, it has been suggested they may be involved in ontogeny and phylogeny of mammals and other vertebrates  <cit> . previous studies identified a functional role for these noncoding sequences both in regulation of alternative splicing and in promoting the expression of several genes  <cit> . calin et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that ucrs are significantly altered at both genomic and expression levels in adult chronic lymphocytic leukemias, colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas. we recently profiled both t-ucrs and micrornas in a cohort of  <dig> high-risk neuroblastoma  tumors, with the aim to investigate their putative role as sensitive markers of outcome prediction in children with stage  <dig> nb  <cit> . our study identified for the first time a signature based on t-ucr expression that is associated with good outcome in non infant patients diagnosed with metastatic nb. moreover, our findings strongly suggest that a deregulation of the microrna/t-ucr network may play an important role in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma.

microarrays, northern blot and reverse transcription-quantitative real-time pcr  have been successfully used to detect t-ucr expression  <cit> . however, these methods preclude the use of many samples of potential clinical interest, such as tumor biopsies, laser microdissected tissues, and sorted cell populations, because of the high quantities of rna required for expression analysis of all  <dig> t-ucrs. on this account, accurate high-throughput profiling of t-ucrs starting from low-input rna is an emerging challenge in molecular biology.

ribo-spia™ technology  <cit> , developed by nugen™ technologies, enables a fast, simple and sensitive method for preparing amplified cdna from total rna to detect low, medium, and high abundance transcripts. the amplified product is single-stranded cdna in the antisense direction of the starting rna and it is ready for qpcr without any purification. such rna amplification procedure is suitable for expression analysis of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes  <cit> . for the first time here we present a novel application of the ribo-spia™ isothermal linear amplification of minute rna quantities for quantifying non-coding protein gene expression.

methods
cell lines and rna isolation
two nb cell lines  , http://www.iclc.it) were cultured at 37°c and 5% co <dig> in rpmi  <dig> medium , supplemented with  <dig> mm l-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 10% foetal bovine serum. total rna was extracted by using the perfectpure™ rna cell kit , including on-column rnase-free dnase i treatment . total and small rnas were quantified and quality control was assessed by rna  <dig> nano® and small rna® assays, respectively, on the  <dig> bioanalyzer . rna samples showed a rna integrity number =  <dig> . both rna samples have been validated as dna-free by a no-reverse transcription assay for eukaryotic 18s rrna gene.

reverse transcription of total rna
rna  was reverse transcribed using  <dig> pmoles of random hexamers  and  <dig> u of superscript ii enzyme  in a total reaction volume of  <dig> μl. the mixture was incubated in a mastercycler® epgradient s  at 25°c for  <dig> minutes, 42°c for  <dig> minutes, and 85°c for  <dig> minutes to stop the reaction. cdna was diluted 10-fold in molecular biology grade water to a final concentration of  <dig> ng/ul, assuming 100% reverse transcription efficiency.

reverse transcription and amplification of total rna
rna was reverse transcribed and amplified by the wt-ovation™ rna amplification system kit  following manufacture's protocol and using the mastercycler® epgradient s . in each reaction rna input was  <dig> ng and cdna product was diluted 1: <dig> in molecular biology grade water.

quantification of t-ucrs by qpcr
t-ucrs were quantified by pre-optimized transcribed ultra conserved regions real-time pcr assays  using sybr® green chemistry. each assay was individually validated by primerdesign ltd and shown to be 100% specific and close to 100% efficient. the qpcr reactions were carried out in a total volume of  <dig> μl, containing  <dig> μl of diluted cdna,  <dig> × realmaster mix sybr rox  and  <dig> nm of the specific t-ucr primer mix. quantification of 18s rrna, used as reference gene, was performed by using vic-labeled taqman® gene expression assay  in a total volume of  <dig> μl, containing  <dig> μl of diluted cdna,  <dig> × realmaster mix probe  and 20× primer/probe mix. reactions were setup in 96-white-well twin.tec® real-time plates  by means of epmotion  <dig> liquid handling workstation . all reactions were performed in duplicate on the mastercycler® eprealplex <dig> s system . cycling conditions were as follows: 95°c for  <dig> minutes,  <dig> cycles at 95°c for  <dig> seconds and at 60°c for  <dig> minutes, followed by a melting curve  to ensure the presence of the specific amplicon. specificity of qpcr reactions has been assessed by melting curve analysis and single runs were excluded when the melting curves revealed unintended amplification products : curves with more than one peak, or one single peak but with a melting temperature different from the expected one . raw qpcr data, melting temperatures and a checklist according to the minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time pcr experiments   <cit>  are submitted as supplemental data .

data analysis
realplex software v.  <dig>   was used to determine quantification cycle  in non-amplified  and amplified  total rna samples. for each cdna, the duplicate t-ucr cq values were averaged, and the normalized cq  was calculated by subtracting the mean cq value for 18s rrna from each t-ucr mean cq value. potential bias introduced upon the cdna amplification step and reliability of differential t-ucr expression were assessed as previously described by mestdagh et al.  <cit> . briefly, differential t-ucr expression between lan- <dig> and gi-me-n cell lines  was determined for each method, with  or without  amplification. then, we have calculated the difference in differential t-ucr expression . optimal reliability of differential t-ucr expression upon cdna amplification should result in a difference lower than  <dig> pcr cycle . the medcalc® software  was used for statistical analyses. significance tests were two tailed.

RESULTS
amplification approach increases sensitivity in t-ucr quantification
in this study we analyzed expression of  <dig> ucrs in lan- <dig> and gi-me-n cell lines by rt-qpcr either with or without cdna amplification. since it is known that a single copy target is generally detected around cycle  <dig>  those t-ucrs showing a cqna above  <dig> were considered as not expressed. in qpcr assays performed on non-amplified gi-me-n and lan- <dig> cdnas the quantification rates were  <dig> and  <dig> t-ucrs, respectively, whereas upon amplification the quantification rate increased on average of 12% . the results above demonstrate the improvement of informative data interrogation by rt-qpcr of the amplified samples as compared to those generated using reverse transcription of total rna. it is noteworthy that the qpcr reaction inputs were equivalent between amplified and non-amplified samples. in fact, assuming 100% amplification efficiency according to the wt-ovation™ technical reports http://www.nugeninc.com, amplification of  <dig> ng total rna should result in about  <dig> μg of cdna. the cdna in  <dig> μl was diluted 1: <dig>  then  <dig> μl  were added per qpcr run. similarly, cdna equivalents of  <dig> ng were used for non-amplified cdna.

amplification approach increases repeatability in t-ucr quantification
we validated qpcr results by measuring intra-assay variation. we performed duplicate qpcr runs and rough cq values were used to calculate the standard deviation  for the cq variance of each t-ucr. highly and moderately expressed t-ucrs  have low sd in both non-amplified  and amplified  lan- <dig> templates . the sd values increase for low expressed t-ucrs , for both amplified and non-amplified cdna, showing a relevant pcr variability only at the lowest abundant ranges. similar results were obtained in gi-me-n cell line . in lan- <dig> cells, the number of assessable duplicated t-ucr runs with a sd ≤  <dig> significantly increases upon the amplification process . similarly,  <dig> out of  <dig> t-ucrs show a sd ≤  <dig> in non-amplified gi-me-n cdna compared to  <dig> out of  <dig> t-ucrs in amplified cdna .

minimal bias due to the amplification approach
in order to assess the potential bias introduced upon the amplification step in each nb cell line, normalized cq values obtained with the wt-ovation™ system  were compared with those obtained by reverse transcriptase of total rna . scatter plots for both lan- <dig> and gi-me-n samples  show a linear correlation between normalized cq with or without amplification with correlation coefficient r ≅  <dig> , indicating that the amplification approach provides a reliable representation of t-ucr transcript abundance in non-amplified cdna. in order to evaluate why data sets do not perfectly fit with a straight line correlation model, we divided t-ucrs into three groups: highly , moderately , and low expressed  t-ucrs. upon amplification step in lan- <dig> cell line, linear correlation analysis shows high biases for the low abundant t-ucrs  as compared to the moderately  and highly  expressed t-ucrs. similar results were obtained in gi-me-n cell line: r =  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for low, moderately and highly expressed t-ucrs, respectively.

amplification method preserves differential t-ucr expression
we wondered whether upon amplification step the level of t-ucr expression was maintained. for this purpose, we calculated the difference between lan- <dig> and gi-me-n in t-ucr expression measured both with and without amplification. the plot of the differential t-ucr expression against each dcqna value shows that 65% of the detectable t-ucrs display a |ΔΔcq| ≤  <dig> . moreover, our results show a near-perfect correlation in differential t-ucr expression  for the most abundant t-ucrs, whereas the average |ΔΔcq| value increases for the moderately expressed t-ucrs , and further for the low expressed t-ucrs . consistently, by setting the cqna cutoff at  <dig>  81% of the detectable t-ucrs display a |ΔΔcq| ≤  <dig> 

discussion
in this study, we evaluated the sensitivity, repeatability, and reliability of a cdna amplification procedure for estimating t-ucr expression by rt-qpcr. this approach comprises steps for cdna synthesis followed by spia™-based linear, isothermal amplification initiated both at the 3' end and randomly throughout the whole transcriptome  <cit> . quantification of the corresponding single-stranded cdna product is based on the sybr® green intercalating chemistry. we directly compared non-amplified with amplified cdnas of lan- <dig> and gi-me-n neuroblastoma cell lines. it is noteworthy that we accurately investigated the advantages of the amplification approach by using equivalent cdna inputs  for each amplified and non-amplified sample. the superior sensitivity of a total rna amplification prior to qpcr is demonstrated, in fact about 12% more t-ucrs were reliably and reproducibly quantified by the spia™ system than using reverse transcriptase of total rna, independently of the cell line.

three separate rna reverse transcriptions and three amplification reactions were performed per sample to interrogate all  <dig> t-ucrs. therefore, to minimize the bias in rna processing efficiency, we separately pooled non-amplified and amplified cdnas necessary for all subsequent qpcr runs. however, we measured intra-assay variation due to i.e. robotic liquid handling and pcr equipments by calculating the amount of error when t-ucr assays were performed in duplicate. standard deviation values showed an high repeatability of sample replicates for highly and moderately expressed t-ucrs, independently of the quantification method, indicating the unbiased amplification procedure. only the lowest abundant t-ucrs have high intra-assay variability, consistently with the influence of poisson distribution statistics and stochastic effects on pcr repeatability  <cit> .

the major risk of an amplification procedure is the loss of the proportional representation of t-ucr expression levels in biological samples. previous studies reported the successful use of the spia™-basedprocedure in expression profiling of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes  <cit> , but so far the effects of such linear amplification on non-coding protein genes have not been evaluated. we therefore assessed the potential bias of the wt-ovation™ system by comparison of t-ucr expression in lan- <dig> and gi-me-n cell lines with or without cdna amplification. correlation coefficient values showed a very good linear relationship among paired amplified and non-amplified samples for highly and moderately expressed t-ucrs. the spia™ system thus provides a reliable representation of the most abundant t-ucr transcripts. variation was high only for rare t-ucrs, that displayed considerable amplification bias affecting their differential expression. our results are consistent with the influence of stochastic models, which significantly contribute to evaluate the accuracy of transcript quantification at low levels  <cit> . in particular, the poisson's statistics predict the frequency distribution of the number of rna molecules that will be present for measurement in each pcr tube. in this context, stochastic fluctuations influence the sensitivity when only a small amount of quantifiable transcripts is available. this implies that the number of measurement repetitions is relevant in the quantification of rare transcripts and that repeated measurements of a transcript at low level should exactly reflect the poisson type of distribution. for example, with two replicates  there is  <dig> % chance to detect at least one positive score when the expected value is  <dig>  under the poisson assumption,  <dig> replicates would detect the remaining  <dig> %  <cit> . however, it is questionable that this improvement in accuracy is worth the cost. as a practical matter, it should be unrealistic to perform all necessary replicate assays to determine the exact amount of rare t-ucr transcripts, also taking into account that our analysis revealed that the trend of differential expression is always preserved for the low abundant t-ucrs.

it is noteworthy that the amplification approach allowed us to significantly reduce the amount of rna  required to analyze all  <dig> t-ucrs per each sample, preserving in the meantime the magnitude of relative expression. therefore, the quantification procedure described here is both an accurate and reliable technique for genome-wide t-ucr profiling when minimal amounts of starting material are available. this requirement is particularly important because tumor sample size is often limited and studies of transcription regulation are increasingly conducted in small homogeneous samples, such as laser capture microdissected or sorted cell populations. it is noteworthy that the biological implications of the scientific advance presented in this manuscript have been recently published  <cit> . in fact, we applied the linear isothermal ribo-spia™ amplification method on  <dig> nb biopsies and this enabled us to establish a t-ucr-expression signature predictive of outcome in non infant patients diagnosed with metastatic nb.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that the spia™ system global amplification of minute amounts of rna prior to qpcr enables sensitive and accurate interrogation of all  <dig> t-ucrs, while expression data should be considered with caution for rare t-ucrs only. we strongly believe that our results open the way to use the method presented here for an accurate high-throughput profiling of non coding protein genes in those samples of potential clinical interest, such as tumor biopsies, laser microdissected tissues, and sorted cell populations, when limited rna amounts are available.
