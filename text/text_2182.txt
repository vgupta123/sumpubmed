BACKGROUND
the biosynthesis pathways of the branched-chain amino acids  all begin with the same precursors  and are catalyzed by acetohydroxy acid synthase . the pathways that lead to valine and isoleucine production have four common enzymatic steps. leucine biosynthesis via the isopropylmalate  pathway branches from the valine biosynthesis pathway with the conversion of 2-ketoisovalerate and acetyl coa to α-isopropylmalate. this first committed step of leucine biosynthesis is catalyzed by α-isopropylmalate synthase . the subsequent two steps are catalyzed by isopropylmalate dehydratase and isopropylmalate dehydrogenase. the final step in the production of leucine is catalyzed by an amino transferase enzyme. the ipm pathway may be the primary metabolic route for producing leucine in bacteria, as enzymes in this pathway have been identified in diverse groups of bacteria  <cit> . the key enzyme of this pathway, α-ipms, has been isolated and characterized in bacteria  <cit> , fungi  <cit>  and plants  <cit> . a comparison of α-ipms from different species shows that there are significant sequence similarities, suggesting that this enzyme is highly conserved  <cit> .

the mycobacterium tuberculosis genome contains several types of repetitive dna sequences, including an insertion sequence , variable number of tandem repeats   <cit> , mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units   <cit> , polymorphic gc-rich repetitive sequences  and direct repeats   <cit> . although the polymorphisms of these repetitive sequences have been studied extensively, most of these studies were focused on strain discrimination and epidemiological studies of m. tuberculosis. at present, the role of vntr in m. tuberculosis is not well understood.

a vntr locus, designated vntr <dig>  has been found within the coding region of the leua gene. the locus contains repeat units of  <dig> bp and an extra  <dig> bp and is polymorphic in various clinical isolates. repeat units range from 2– <dig> copies, and those with two copies are the most abundant  <cit> . the leua gene from most beijing strains and from the two completely sequenced virulent strains h37rv and cdc <dig> contain two copies of 57-bp tandem repeats. since the repeats are multiples of  <dig> bp, a deletion or insertion of  <dig> bp would not interfere with the translational frame of the protein, but would be result in the deletion or insertion of the repetitive 19-amino acid residues. in fact, deletion of the two 57-bp repeat units seemed to have no effect on the functionality of the mutant α-ipms compared to the wild-type α-ipms. this suggests that the repetitive 19-amino acid residues are dispensable  <cit> .

previously, recombinant α-ipms from m. tuberculosis h37rv was purified and characterized  <cit> . a recent investigation reported the kinetics of the enzyme with two copies of the repeat  <cit> . the three-dimensional crystal structure of α-ipms has also been solved and shows that zn2+ and α-kiv bind at the active site, while l-leucine  binds at the regulatory region  <cit> . the feedback inhibition of α-ipms by l-leucine is reversible and is described as being a slow-onset inhibition. first, the binding of l-leucine to the enzyme substrate complex causes an inhibitory signal that can be transmitted through the linker domains. a slow isomerization step then occurs, generating a more tightly bound form  <cit> .

it has been shown that m. tuberculosis strains that have α-ipms with three, four and six copies of the repeat units contain proteins of corresponding sizes that can be detected by polyclonal antibodies against α-ipms  <cit> . however, it is not known if the leua from m. tuberculosis strains that contain very higher numbers of the repeats is translated into a full-length, intact protein with the same activity. in this study, we have cloned, expressed and characterized the products of the leua genes with either two or  <dig> copies of vntr. our results indicate that some enzymatic properties of the recombinant his6-tagged α-ipms with  <dig> copies of repeats  are different from those with two copies .

RESULTS
cloning and expression of the leua gene with  <dig> copies of tandem repeats
the leua gene from m. tuberculosis strain  <dig> contains  <dig> copies of the vntr repeat unit and is  <dig> bp long. the amplification of leua with the designed primers resulted in pcr products of the predicted size, as shown in figure  <dig>  dna sequencing confirmed the copy number of the 57-bp repeat. the amplified dna fragment of leua with  <dig> copies of the vntr repeat unit was cloned into the pet15b expression vector with the n-terminus fused to hexa-histidine  in the same fashion as leua from the h37rv strain, which contains two copies of the repeat unit. the recombinant plasmids, designated p14c and p2c, respectively, were expressed in e. coli bl <dig> . the sizes of α-ipms-2cr and α-ipms-14cr were the expected sizes  of the full-length proteins . we found that induction of enzyme expression by iptg at low temperature  results in higher solubility than induction at 37°c. this last condition was critical for α-ipms-14cr, as it is expressed to lower levels than α-ipms-2cr. when expressed at 37°c, almost all of the α-ipms-14cr protein aggregates ).

purification of his6-tagged proteins under native conditions
the purification of the his6-tagged proteins of α-ipms-2cr and α-ipms-14cr under native conditions using a ni-nta column yielded 90% and 80% pure protein, respectively. these proteins were further purified by gel filtration to approximately 99% purity. the yield of recombinant protein per gram of cell wet weight was  <dig> – <dig>  mg for α-ipms-2cr and  <dig> – <dig>  mg for α-ipms-14cr. the oligomeric state of each recombinant protein, as suggested by gel filtration analysis, was of a dimer . although purified α-ipms-2cr was composed of both dimeric and tetrameric forms, the majority of the protein is in present as a dimer. in addition, the enzymatic activity of the dimeric form was three times higher than that of the tetrameric protein . the majority of purified α-ipms-14cr was in dimeric form, with enzymatic activity six times higher than that of the minor fractions in monomeric form .

enzymatic properties of his6-α-ipms
both α-ipms-2cr and α-ipms-14cr enzymes worked well at a ph between  <dig>  and  <dig> . at ph  <dig>  α-ipms-2cr lost much of its activity, while the activity of α-ipms-14cr remained . the optimal temperature for both enzymes was approximately 37–42°c. at 50°c, the activity of α-ipms-14cr remained at 75%, whereas the activity of α-ipms-2cr dropped below 50% .

the kinetic parameters of α-ipms-2cr and α-ipms-14cr for both substrates are summarized in table  <dig>  the apparent km and vmax of α-ipms-2cr do not agree with those reported previously   <cit> . the reason for these discrepancies is unclear, but may be at least partially due to differences in enzyme preparation and storage conditions. in the previous report, the enzyme was maintained in an elution buffer containing 100– <dig> mm imidazol, while in this report, dialysis was performed to eliminate imidazol from the enzyme solutions and purified protein fractions obtained by gel filtration were used in the assays.

a at ph  <dig>  and 37°c. the apparent km and vmax values were determined by varying the concentrations of one substrate at a fixed saturating concentration of the other substrate. α-ketoisovaleric acid and acetyl coa was fixed at  <dig> mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively. data are the average of two assays. prism software  was used for nonlinear regression, curve fit analysis to calculate km and vmax.

bkcat = vmax/ /

comparison of the apparent km/vmax of α-ipms-2cr and α-ipms-14cr, processed through similar conditions, shows that α-ipms-2cr has a lower affinity for its substrates than α-ipms-14cr . the vmax values for both substrates of α-ipms-2cr were higher than those of α-ipms-14cr, resulting in a higher kcat. α-ipms-14cr has a higher catalytic efficiency, however, as kcat/km ratios for α-ketoisovaleric acid and acetyl coa were approximately  <dig> and  <dig> times higher, respectively, than those of α-ipms-2cr. the l-leucine feedback inhibition of α-ipms was investigated with the addition of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm l-leucine to the enzyme assay mixtures. the inhibition of α-ipms-2cr was clearly detectable in the presence of  <dig>  mm l-leucine, and the enzyme was inhibited by almost 50% with  <dig>  mm l-leucine. l-leucine had no significant effect on α-ipms-14cr activity under similar assay conditions .

discussion
the structure of the m. tuberculosis α-ipms monomer  consists of an n-terminal catalytic domain and a c-terminal regulatory domain, which are linked by two small subdomains. the n-terminal domain  forms an  <dig> tim barrel that accommodates the active site. residues 1– <dig> function in dimerization. in the linker domain, subdomain i  is composed of α <dig> and two short β-strands, while subdomain ii  contains α11-α <dig>  the c-terminal regulatory domain  is composed of two βββα units   <cit> . the function of the repeat sequences within the coding sequence of α-ipms remains unclear, as this repeat segment  is disordered in the crystal structure  <cit> . singh and bhakuni  demonstrated that although the isolated tim barrel domain of α-ipms retains its folded conformation, it has only 12% of the functional activity of the intact enzyme. this result indicates that the c-terminus influences the activity of the enzyme  <cit> . here, we show that α-ipms-2cr and α-ipms-14cr are both dimers in solution, as has been observed previously with α-ipms-2cr  <cit> . the differences between the two enzymes in their activities at high ph and temperature and in some of their kinetic parameters indicate that the copy number of the repeat unit does affect the properties of the protein.

the optimal ph for both α-ipms-2cr and α-ipms-14cr was between  <dig>  and  <dig> , similar to those in other organisms. α-ipms from s. typhimurium  <cit> , s. cerevisiae  <cit> , clostridium spp and bacteroides fragilis  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit>  have optimal phs of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the optimal temperature for both α-ipms-2cr and α-ipms-14cr enzymes was the same as the physiological temperature of m. tuberculosis . most previous reports assayed enzymes at the physiological temperatures of their respective organisms as well, e.g., 30°c for yeast α-ipms and 37°c for s. typhimuriumα-ipms. the anaerobic bacteria clostridium spp and bacteroides fragilis have higher optimal temperature for α-ipms, ranging from 37–46°c  <cit> . the apparent km values for α-ipms-2cr and α-ipms-14cr are different from those previously reported  <cit> . a wide range of km values for α-ipms activity on α-kiv and acetyl coa have been reported in m. tuberculosis  <cit> , s. typhimurium  <cit>  and s. cerevisiae  <cit>  .

de carvalho and blanchard  previously demonstrated that the kinetic mechanism of α-ipms in m. tuberculosis is a non-rapid, equilibrium random bi-bi and that the chemistry is not a rate-limiting step in the overall reaction. it was suggested that with physiological substrates, slow substrate binding, product dissociation or conformational changes in the enzyme are likely to be the rate-limiting step. this hypothesis is consistent with the fact that α-ipms-14cr has a lower vmax relative to α-ipms-2cr. α-ipms-14cr, with the additional  <dig> copies of the repeat units, is ~30% larger than α-ipms-2cr.

the lower km  of α-ipms-14cr is more difficult to understand. a report on the cystine protease cpb isoforms of leishmania mexicana showed that variation in a few charged amino acid residues located outside of but close to the active site may influence the electrostatic potential on the surface of the proteins, resulting in different km values  <cit> . in the case of α-ipms-14cr, although the segment of the protein that includes the  <dig> copies of the repeat units is located in the c-terminal domain, it may come into close proximity with the active site due to its huge size. the amino acid composition of the repeat units may also be important. since seven of the  <dig> residues in the repeat unit are hydrophilic and charged , they could affect the electrostatic potential on the surface of the enzyme and, therefore, the enzyme's affinity for its substrates.

the mechanism of l-leucine inhibition was suggested to be a slow-onset inhibition   <cit> . after a rapid formation of an initial inhibitory complex , isomerization of the complex occurs, leading to a tightly bound complex. evidence confirmed that an inhibitory signal is transmitted through the linker domain to the catalytic domain, as the tyr410phe mutant form of m. tuberculosis α-ipms is insensitive to l-leucine feedback inhibition  <cit> . mutations that abolish l-leucine feedback inhibition in s. cerevisiae α-ipms are clustered around residues surrounding the l-leucine binding site   <cit> . the repeat sequences  are adjacent to the residues that surround the l-leucine binding site . it is possible that α-ipms-14cr failed to respond to l-leucine inhibition because the transmission of the l-leucine inhibition signal, the isomerization step or both were obstructed by the large segment of  <dig> amino acid residues, preventing the formation of the tight complex of enzyme and leucine.

repetitive dna sequences can rearrange to increase or decrease the number of the repetitive elements through replication "slippage" events  <cit> . thus, strains with low numbers of tandem repeats can evolve to have higher copy numbers and vice versa. vntr <dig> analysis of  <dig> clinical strains from amnatchareon showed that the frequencies of bacteria with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> copies of the repeat unit are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively  <cit> . while most strains contain two copies, including most of the beijing strains, the existence of strains with high copy numbers suggest that there may be a selective advantage to having more repeat units in some environments.

previous studies have shown that leucine auxotrophs  of m. bovis bcg and m. tuberculosis are unable to grow in macrophages and in mice  <cit> , suggesting that leucine cannot be obtained in such environments. although there is no data on the amino acid concentrations in m. tuberculosis present in macrophages, it can be speculated that α-ipms proteins with high copy numbers of the repeat may be useful in macrophages. with a lower km, α-ipms can work sufficiently even at low concentrations of substrate, and with a low vmax, growth is only partially affected. moreover, l-leucine feedback inhibition may not be necessary in m. tuberculosis when it is residing in macrophages. whether vntr <dig> contributes to the differential survival in these environments is unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
α-ipms-2cr and α-ipms-14cr have significantly different affinities for the two substrates, α-ketoisovalerate and acetyl coa, and respond differently to inhibition by the enzymatic end-product, l-leucine. the large insertion of the vntr  likely interferes with the enzyme structure and function, though it is also possible that α-ipms-14cr does not bind l-leucine and, therefore, does not respond to feedback inhibition. further work on the binding of l-leucine to α-ipms-14cr will clarify this result.
