BACKGROUND
thanks to novel high-throughput sequencing  technologies  <cit> , today a human genome can be sequenced very quickly at affordable prices. the emergence of these platforms, together with the development of powerful computational tools, have transformed biological and biomedical research over the past several years allowing the achievement of large-scale population sequencing projects, such as the  <dig> genomes project   <cit>  and the cancer genome atlas , and opened a new era for personal genomics  <cit> . existing hts technologies generate billions of short sequences , and although computational methods may permit routine use of de novo assembly, sequencing a human genome typically allows to relate sequence information to a reference haploid genome: the so-called resequencing strategy.

in re-sequencing approach, the key first step is the alignment, or mapping, of all the reads to a reference genome by using short read alignment tools  <cit> . once the reads have been properly mapped, genomic variants can be discovered by identifying differences between the reference genome and the aligned reads. by using this procedure, it is possible to identify single nucleotide variants   <cit> , small insertions and deletions   <cit>  and infer dna copy number variants  <cit> .

in diploid genomes, such as the human genome, variants can be found in one chromosome  or in both chromosomes . in the first case, the variant can be responsible for dominant phenotypes, while in the latter for recessive phenotypes. the identification of homozygous and heterozygous variants have a strong medical relevance since it is at the base of the discovery of loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations. loss-of-function variants in homozygous state are the most common cause of autosomal recessive mendelian disorders, while gain-of-function variants that change the gene product to a new and abnormal function usually lead to dominant mendelian disorders. moreover, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations inherited in germline cells or acquired in somatic cells are often the starting events of cancer evolution and proliferation. functionally relevant variants responsible for mendelian disorders  <cit>  and cancer  <cit>  have been successfully identified by using the re-sequencing strategy  <cit> .

the discovery of a functionally relevant variant requires to identify differences between aligned reads and the sequence of the haploid reference genome. the sequence of the human reference genome  <cit>  was obtained from a collection of dnas from anonymous individuals with primarily european origins and assembled into a mosaic haploid genome. the clinical and phenotypic information of the participants is unknown. although they were likely to be healthy at the time of study, some of them might be carriers of disease risk alleles. the human reference genome is maintained and updated by the genome reference consortium  which is responsible to correct the small number of regions in the reference that are currently misrepresented, to close as many remaining gaps as possible and to produce alternative assemblies of structurally variant loci when necessary. since  <dig>  the major assembly release for human genome has been grch <dig> that is present in various genome browsers and databases including ensembl, ncbi and ucsc genome browser. in december  <dig>  the grc announced the public release of grch <dig>  the latest version of the human reference genome assembly. this represents the first major assembly update since  <dig>  and introduces changes to chromosome coordinates.

large scale population re-sequencing projects, such as the 1000gp and the exome sequencing project , allowed to create a large and detailed catalogue of human genetic variations and improved our knowledge of the human genetic variation. recently, the 1000gp consortium, by combining low-coverage whole-genome sequencing  and high-coverage whole-exome sequencing  of  <dig> individuals from  <dig> populations, identified around  <dig> million single nucleotide polymorphic positions and  <dig>  million short insertions and deletions  <cit> .

in this work, we re-analyzed the complete set of these variant calls, and we found that more than  <dig> loci of the grch <dig> assembly have a reference allele frequency smaller than 1% . moreover, we also discovered that for the great majority of these loci the reference allele has never been observed in homozygous state and for a significant part neither in heterozygous state. these findings suggest that for many of these loci the reference allele could have functional consequences or even being a loss/gain-of-function variant. to evaluate the biological relevance and the deleteriousness of finding the reference allele in these loci we studied them by using several annotation databases and measures of functional impact. we found that a large fraction of these loci belong to genomic features identified by gencode  <cit>  or regulatory elements discovered by the encode project  <cit> , and a significant fraction has functional consequences on genes that are linked to mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancer. we also demonstrated that currently available computational approaches for the detection of germline and somatic snvs and indels fail to call variants in rra loci when one of the alleles is the reference allele. to complement the variant calls from currently available tools we developed a novel software package for the detection and annotation of germline and somatic variants in rra loci that we named rarevator . as a proof of principle, we applied rarevator to the analysis of a publicly available whole-exome sequencing cancer dataset and we compared these results with those obtained by two state-of-the-art variant callers, varscan <dig>  <cit>  and mutect  <cit> . our tool was able to identify around  <dig> germline and  <dig> somatic rra variants that were missed by the other two tools. we further searched for significantly mutated genes and pathways and showed that some of these rra variants belong to signicantly mutated pathways and can thus have a role in human development and tumorigenesis.

RESULTS
variant analysis
we downloaded the complete set of variant calls produced by the 1000gp consortium from ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/release/ <dig> and we estimated the allele frequency of all the snvs and small indels across the  <dig> individuals . we found that  <dig>  snv loci and  <dig>  small indel loci  have a reference allele frequency  smaller than  <dig> , revealing that almost  <dig>  loci of the grch <dig> assembly are rra loci .summary statistics of the rra loci

to evaluate the reliability of these results, we compared the allele frequencies estimated by the 1000gp consortium with those calculated by the nhlbi go exome sequencing project  on the same loci . since the esp sequencing experiments have been performed for coding regions , only  <dig> of the  <dig>  snvs and  <dig> of the  <dig> indel overlap with the esp variants. despite the limited number of shared variants, and the fact that esp sequenced individuals affected by several disorders, we found strong concordance between the two datasets. all the  <dig> snvs have a reference af <  <dig>  and  <dig> snvs <  <dig> , while  <dig> of the  <dig> indels have a reference af <  <dig>  .

to investigate the genetic characteristics of these loci, we calculated their genotype counts  and we classified them into three classes. the first class  contains the loci in which the reference allele has never been observed in 1000gp individuals and for this reason it could have loss-of-function as well as gain-of-function role. in class b, the reference allele has been observed only in the heterozygous state and could consequently have a loss-of-fuction role. finally, for class c loci, the reference allele has been observed in both heterozygous and homozygous state in at least one individual and for this reason the reference allele could have moderate phenotypic impact. the results of this analysis are summarized in table  <dig> and show that  <dig>  snvs and  <dig>  indel loci  are of class a,  <dig>  snvs and  <dig>  indel loci  of class b and  <dig>  snvs and  <dig> indels loci  of class c.

to understand if these alleles are sequencing artifacts belonging to complex and hard-to-sequence regions of the genome, we calculated the gc content and mappability of the  <dig> bp region surrounding each rra locus and we compared them with  <dig> bp regions randomly sampled from the genome. although a small fraction of these regions have values of gc-content and mappability that could affect the correct identification of variant alleles, globally the distributions of gc content and mappability calculated for rra loci  are identical to the distributions of randomly sampled regions. these results suggest that the presence of rra alleles in the human genome reference sequence can not be fully ascribable to issues of genome complexity or sequencing errors. as a further step, in order to understand if rras are rare/private variants of individuals used by the human genome project, we studied the presence of these alleles in the four different macro populations of the 1000gp: european , american , asian  and african  . almost 45% of the rras are shared by two, three or all four macro populations, while more than 7% belong to individuals from european, american or asian origins. interestingly, more than 25% of the rras are private/rare variants of individuals from african populations, and this is in accordance with the fact that the majority of the reference dna used by the human genome project was from donor rp <dig>  an individual likely of african-american ancestry  <cit> . overall, from these results we can conclude that the presence of these rare alleles in the reference assembly of the human genome can be ascribed to both sequencing errors and private variants of the anonymous individuals used by the human genome project.


variant annotation
gencode
snvs and small indels in protein-coding genes can severely affect the function of the encoded proteins and lead to disease states  <cit> . exonic snvs such as missense mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions and nonsense mutations introducing new stop codons can seriously disrupt the function of human protein-coding genes. frameshifting indels result in a completely different translation of the original protein that could be abnormally shorter or longer, likely altering its function. variants in intronic regions affecting constitutive splice sites may have severe functional consequences similar to nonsense or missense mutations, resulting in aberrantly included introns or skipped exons, and sometimes in nonsense-mediated decay. moreover, in the last few years, it has become clear that also the non-protein-coding portion of the genome is of crucial importance for normal development and physiology and for and for the appearance of disease phenotypes. this is particularly evident for micrornas for which it has been shown that genetic changes are hallmark of cancers, but also variants in large intergenic non-coding rnas , small nucleolar rnas  and other ncrnas might contribute to the development of many different human disorders  <cit> . to understand the functional relevance of all the rra loci we studied their overlap with the biotypes annotated by the gencode consortium  and we found that more than half  belong to gencode features. specifically,  <dig>  snvs and  <dig>  indels  are part of protein-coding genes, while  <dig>  snvs and  <dig>  indel  belong to ncrna features. the most represented non-coding biotype is lincrna, followed by antisense and processed transcripts, while  <dig> snvs and  <dig> indels  belong to pseudogenes. genotype counts analysis show that around 25% of the gencode loci belongs to class a variants  and around 70% to class b , suggesting that for a large part of these loci the reference allele could have phenotypic consequences.gencode and encode annotations of all the rra loci for grch <dig> and grch38

to facilitate the interpretation of these rra loci and discern between phenotypically relevant and neutral variants we used the genomic evolutionary rate profiling  “rejected substitutions”  score  and we calculated the total number of snvs and insertions with rs score larger than  <dig> and the total number of deletions that contain at least one base with rs score larger than  <dig>  moreover, to study the functional consequence of rra loci that belong to protein-coding genes, we annotated them as missense, nonsense, frameshift and splicing variants by using the variant effect predictor  tool . among gencode rras,  <dig>  snvs and  <dig> indels  have rs ≥ <dig> , and more than 90% belong to class a or b. moreover,  <dig> snvs and  <dig> indels  have functional consequences by changing or disrupting the protein sequence, and around 50%  of these belong to classes a or b and have or contain bases with rs ≥ <dig>  these results suggest that for more than  <dig> loci of the human reference genome in coding genes the reference allele could have loss-of-function or gain-of-function effects.

as a further step, to evaluate the impact of gencode rra loci on rare and complex phenotypes, we exploited the annotation of the genetic association database  and the online mendelian inheritance in man resource  . we found that around 25% of the genic rra loci  has positive association with a complex phenotype annotated at the gad  and 95% belong to class a or b. for both snvs and indels, the most represented gad class is psychiatric followed by chemdependency, neurological, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular classes. concerning ncrnas ,  <dig> snvs and  <dig> indels  are annotated at the gad and the most represented categories are cancer and immune followed by metabolic, psychiatric, developmental and cardiovascular. also for ncrnas, around 95% of rra loci belong to class a or b. among the functionally relevant variants ,  <dig>  belong to genes annotated in the omim database and  <dig> are of class a or b and have or contain bases with rs≥ <dig> 

regulatory elements
genomic elements involved in the regulation of transcription and in the processing and control of rna transcripts play important cellular and developmental roles, and in some cases mutations within them contribute to diseases. experimental evidences have shown that the presence of variants in regulatory regions can lead to differences in transcription factor  binding between individuals  <cit> , altering the regulation of gene transcription. this can be explained by the fact that variants can generate an increase or a decrease in the binding affinity of a given tf and leading to a change in gene expression. in some cases, snvs and indels may eliminate an existing binding site and/or generate a new one for a different tf, which can have a dramatic effect on the gene expression pattern.

for these reasons, to evaluate the impact of rra loci on binding variation and regulatory mechanisms, we studied their overlap with the regulatory elements discovered by the encode project . we found that  <dig>  snvs and  <dig>  small indels  are part of at least one of the regulatory elements annotated by the encode project. furthermore, around 10% of these loci overlap with all the three different regulatory features , 25% belong at least to two, while 65% are part of only one regulatory element. more than 90% of them  belong to class a or b . gad annotation of the total set of regulatory rra loci showed that  <dig> snvs and  <dig> indels are associated with a complex phenotype . the reference allele of more than 90% of them has never been observed in homozygous state . also for regulatory rra loci the most represented gad phenotypes are cardiovascular, psychiatric, metabolic and neurological.

as a final step, we scored the regulatory impact of rra loci by using the regulomedb tool  <cit> . regulomedb combines experimental datasets from encode and other sources with computational predictions and manual annotations to score the functional impact of genomic variants. the scoring system represents with increasing confidence that a variant lies in a functional location and likely results in a functional consequence. lower scores indicate increasing evidence for a variant to be located in a functional region . these analyses are summarized in additional file 1: figure s <dig> j-l and show that  <dig>  snvs and  <dig> indels  are predicted to have a functional role by regulomedb. in particular,  <dig>  snvs and  <dig> indels  are predicted to lie in a functional region and to affect tf binding  and more than 90% belong to class a or b.

taken as a whole, these results evidence that the grch <dig> assembly contains tens of thousands of loci located into coding, non coding and regulatory elements for which the presence of the reference allele may imply deleterious functional consequences. missing these variants in re-sequencing studies could affect the interpretation of the whole results and hamper the discovery of disease-related loci.

rras detection
the identification of snvs and indels from hts data is accomplished by means of the so-called snv and indel callers that can be categorized into two main classes: germline and somatic methods. somatic callers have been properly developed to detect variants occurring de novo within groups of somatic cells. to date, they have been mainly applied in cancer studies and the basic idea behind these methods consists in finding variant alleles that are present in the tumor sample but not in the matched control. the first computational method for somatic variants detection  <cit>  relied on independently calling the genotype of the two samples followed by subtraction of the normal sample calls from the cancer calls to obtain a candidate somatic mutation set. recently, several authors introduced somatic methods, such as varscan <dig>  <cit>  and mutect  <cit> , that use a probabilistic framework to simultaneously compare the reads of a tumor sample and a matched normal sample to identify statistically significant differences at each variant site. since these methods are devised to detect every kind of differences between normal and tumor samples, in principle, they are able to identify somatic variants that belong to rra loci. however, the probabilistic calling step is followed by a filtering step  <cit>  in which germline variants found in normal sample are used to discard somatic calls . for this reason, in rra loci, somatic variants in heterozygous state are rejected when the normal sample has the alternative allele  in homozygous state.


on the other hand, germline callers are devised to detect variants from the solely comparison to the reference genome. they are all based on probabilistic frameworks that use the number of reads presenting differences from the reference genome to detect a variant. clearly, they are not able to detect variants in rra loci when the reference allele is in homozygous state. moreover, also the reference alleles in heterozygous state are missed by classical resequencing analysis pipelines, since variant calling is usually followed by a filtering step in which known variants  <cit>  with allele frequency larger than a predefined threshold  are discarded .

following these considerations, currently available callers are not able to identify variants that contain the reference allele in rra loci. to overcome these limits, we developed a novel tool, rarevator , that exploits the gatk unified genotyper for interrogating all the rra loci and detecting, among them, variants that contain the reference allele . rarevator takes into account only gatk high-quality calls . the variant quality score is a phred-scaled estimation of the calling confidence of gatk, and qual ≥  <dig> corresponds to an error rate smaller than  <dig> %. for this reason, the sensitivity and specificity of our tool completely reflect the performance of the algorithms at the base of the unified genotyper gatk computational pipeline. rarevator is able to call germline rra variants in single- and multi-samples experiments  as well as somatic rra variants in pairs of matched tumor and normal samples .

to demonstrate the usefulness of our tool in re-sequencing studies, we applied it to the analysis of a publicly available whole-exome sequencing dataset of  <dig> pairs of metastasizing uveal melanomas and matched peripheral blood lymphocytes samples  <cit> . we first applied rarevator on the  <dig> peripheral blood samples for the identification of germline variants. this analysis  shows that classical germline calling pipelines missed the detection of  <dig> rra snvs  and  <dig> indels . more than 80% of these variants  belong to class b, and only a small fraction are of class a  or class c . among the rras calls we also found variants that lead to protein functional consequences  and variants that have a positive association with a complex phenotype annotated at the gad .

then we used rarevator on the  <dig> matched tumor-normal pairs to identify somatic variants in rra loci and we compared these results to those obtained by mutect and varscan <dig>  our tool was able to identify  <dig> somatic variants that were missed by the other two state-of-the-art methods, and  <dig> of these variants are missense . rra missense mutations affected five different genes: dcc, cr <dig>  fat <dig>  gcc <dig> and clcn <dig>  to understand the relevance of these five genes in tumorigenesis we studied their role in other cancer studies by using the driverdb database  <cit> . driverdb is a web resource that includes mutation profiles from  <dig> tumor-normal pairs  of  <dig> different cancer types and exploits eight computational methods to identify driver cancer genes for each tumor type. we downloaded all the driver genes inferred by the driverdb resources and we found that all the five genes affected by missense rras in our uveal melanoma dataset were predicted as driver gene in at least one cancer type by one of the eight computational methods . surprisingly, four of the genes containing rra missense mutaions in uveal melanoma  were predicted as diver genes in tcga skin cutaneous melanoma dataset. although skin and uveal melanoma have different genetic and molecular features, are known to have the same cellular origin  and the four genes predicted as driver in skin melanoma could be related to some key basic functions also in uveal melanoma.

to evaluate the potential involvement of the rra somatic mutations on the uveal melanoma tumorigenesis, we searched for significantly mutated genes  and pathways  that contain the rra mutations. smgs are genes that have a higher mutation rate with respect to a background mutation rate  <cit> . a gene can be found to be a smg because it contains driver mutations that are selected during tumorigenesis, and therefore can contribute to disease progression. in the same way, smps are pathways  with a high mutation rate and that are selected during tumorigenesis and can contribute to disease progression. to identify smgs and smps, we applied the mutsigcv  <cit>  and drgap  <cit>  algorithms to the sets of somatic mutations identified by mutect and varscan <dig> and separately to the same sets integrated with the rra mutations identified by rarevator. mutsigcv estimates the background mutation rate for each gene-patient-category combination based on the observed silent mutations in the gene and non-coding mutations in the surrounding regions and is considered one of the best methods for the identification of smgs. drgap models the probability of observing a given set of mutations in a gene with the poisson distribution and then calculates a likelihood ratio test to evaluate if there is an increased rate of mutation. the poisson model for a single gene is extended to analyze a pathway or gene set by treating multiple genes within a pathway as a “big” gene. we used drgap to test several curated pathways and computational gene sets . the mutsigcv did not identify any smg in all the datasets we tested. however, the results of these analyses show that rra variants affect calculation and significance of the mutation rate: additional file 1: table s <dig> shows that the five genes that contain missense rra mutations have a significant increase in smg ranking when the analysis comprised the mutations identified by rarevator. the rras have the same effect also in the calculation of the significantly mutated pathways. drgap identified four smps that contain the rra mutations . all these pathways are related to the immune response and interestingly, one of them  reached the statistical significant threshold  thanks to the contribution of rra mutations. these results do not demonstrate at all that rra mutations actively participate to the tumorigenesis in the uveal melanoma cancer, but the missing of these variants can seriously affect the identification of genes and pathways that might have an important role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression.drgap pathways analysis

rras in pathways and driver genes
the results described in previous section on a small cancer dataset demonstrated that the identification of mutations in rra loci can affect the discovery of driver genes and pathways in cancer studies. to obtain a global picture of the potential impact of rra loci on biological processes and functional pathways, we selected all the genes in the human genome that contains at least one functionally relevant rra loci  and we searched for enriched gene sets. the enrichment analysis was applied to the gene ontology  terms biological process , molecular function , and cellular component , and to pathway databases curated by kegg, reactome and biocarta, by using the david web resource  <cit> . the enrichment analysis identified  <dig> statistically significant gene sets :  <dig> go cc terms,  <dig> mf terms,  <dig> bp terms,  <dig> reactome and  <dig> kegg pathways . significantly enriched go mf terms are mainly related to ion binding function, while many enriched bp terms are associated to lipid metabolism and transport. interestingly, among bp terms and pathways, we observed a recurrent enrichment for functions related to cell adhesion and extracellular matrix  interaction, and for the dna repair pathway. strikingly, adhesion and interaction with extracellular matrix and surrounding cells are extremely important for integrity and homeostasis maintenance in normal tissues, and alterations in microenvironment and related functions are notoriously associated with cancer transformation and metastasis  <cit> . moreover, the dna repair pathway is one of the crucial processes responsible for genome integrity and cell survival. strictly connected to cell cycle checkpoints, alterations of genes involved in this pathway support genetic instability and dna damage tolerance, typically leading to death escape for tumor cells. being this pathway a hallmark of cancer it is currently exploited for molecular targeted therapeutic approaches  <cit> . overall, these results indicated that functionally relevant rras are involved in basic cellular processes essential for normal cell functions, whose impairment is strictly associated with malignant transformation and tumorigenesis.

to evaluate the potential impact of rra loci in cancer studies, we assessed the overlap between genes containing rra loci and the cancer driver genes predicted by tcga. recently,  <cit> , by exploiting the tcga whole-exome sequencing datasets  and eight different algorithms for smg identification, provided a list of  <dig> high-confidence cancer driver genes. among them , we found that  <dig> genes  showed at least one rra locus in exons, introns or utr, while  <dig> genes  contained a functionally relevant rra . all these genes with a missense or splicing rra locus were predicted to be common driver genes in at least  <dig> or all the  <dig> cancer types taken into consideration, thus emphasizing their involvement in essential tumorigenic processes . eight of these genes have a mutation frequency larger than  <dig>  in at least one of the  <dig> cancer types. notably, among them, we found the serine/threonine kinase pi3/pi4-kinase atm gene, which encodes a crucial checkpoint kinase controlling several downstream proteins, including tp <dig> and brca <dig>  required for cell cycle arrest and dna damage repair activation. given its centrality for many cancer types, this apical master controller is currently used as clinically actionable target for anti-cancer therapies  <cit> . taken as a whole, these results demonstrated that rra loci with potential functional consequences could impact genes and pathways that play fundamental roles in several disease states.


grch38
recently, the grc announced the public release of grch <dig>  the latest version of the human reference genome assembly. in the announcement , the grc reports that “large scale studies of human variation, such as the  <dig> genomes project, identified a number of bases and indels in grch <dig> that were never seen in any individuals, suggesting they may represent errors in the assembly.” for these reasons several thousand individual bases were updated in grch <dig> 

to understand the extent of this update we compared the reference alleles between grch <dig> and grch <dig> assemblies and we found that the great majority of snvs  and deletions  was not corrected, while almost all insertions  were updated . among the unchanged rra loci we found  <dig>  snvs and  <dig>  deletions of class a or b belonging to gencode features, and among them,  <dig>  snvs and  <dig> deletions have rs ≥ <dig>  although a significant fraction of coding rra loci of class a was corrected , the grch <dig> assembly still contains  <dig> class a or b variants  with functional consequences and  <dig>  are located into omim genes.

moreover,  <dig>  snvs and  <dig> deletions have a positive association with a gad phenotype and as in the analysis of grch <dig>  the most represented phenotypes are chemdependency, cardiovascular, metabolic and immune . for regulatory elements ,  <dig> snvs and  <dig> deletions are part of encode features and of these variants, 90%  belongs to class a or b. furthermore,  <dig>  snvs and  <dig>  deletions are still annotated by regulomedb and around 5% have a score ≤ <dig> . concerning cancer genes,  <dig> tcga driver genes still contain at least one rra locus, and as in grch <dig>  for  <dig> of them the rra is functionally relevant . taken as a whole, these results show that although the grc corrected almost all the rra insertions and a significant fraction of snvs and deletions for which the reference allele has never been observed, a large number of functionally relevant rra loci still remain unchanged in grch <dig> 

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the development of hts technologies is revolutionizing the molecular diagnosis of human diseases. the ability to generate enormous amount of sequence data in a short time at an affordable cost makes this approach ideal for a wide range of applications from sequencing a group of candidate genes, all coding regions to the entire human genome. the identification of variants with these technologies is based on comparing the reads produced by hts platforms with the haploid sequence of the human reference genome and finding the bases that differ from the reference genome sequence. hts-based approaches have been successfully used to identify disease causing variants in mendelian disorders as well as in the study of genomic instability in cancer samples. in this work we demonstrate that the haploid sequence of the human reference genome grch <dig> contains almost  <dig> loci in which the reference allele has never been observed in healthy individuals and around  <dig> loci in which it has been observed only in the heterozygous state. we studied the genomic complexity of the regions surrounding these loci and the geographical origins of their alleles and we found that their presence in the human reference assembly can be due to both sequencing errors and rare/private variants of the anonymous individuals used by the human genome project. by analyzing the genomic position of these loci we found that more than half of them belong to gencode biotypes and around 25% are part of regulatory elements discovered by the encode project.

moreover, we also discovered that 1% of these loci belongs to coding portions of the genome and that a significant fraction has potential functional consequences on genes that have been previously linked to mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancer. the complete list of these functionally relevant rra loci is reported in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  in these tables the genomic information is enriched with functional and disease annotations . among the omim annotation of the genes containing functionally relevant snv and indel rra loci, we found genetic phenotypes causing developmental delay, intellectual disability/mental retardation, cardiomyopathy and cancer .

to emphasize the impact that many of these loci could have on human health, we report some examples of rra variants present in genes that have been demonstrated to be causative of neurological disorders and cancer. the aspm gene, that is associated with primary autosomal recessive microcephaly type  <dig> and seizures  <cit> , contains a missense rra snv of class b. another missense rra snv of class b belongs to fat <dig> gene, whose biallelic disruption was recently associated with a human recessive syndrome including periventricular neuronal heterotopia  <cit> . gria <dig>  that is an important gene associated with a x-linked intellectual disability known as lissencephaly, and recql <dig>  that is responsible for some cases of the autosomal recessive rothmund-thomson syndrome, contain a frameshift insertion and a splicing insertion of class b, respectively. among class a variants, we found missense, splicing and frameshift rra loci in col4a <dig>  pign and atm genes. col4a <dig> has been associated to several disorders and has been reported to carry causal heterozygous mutations in patients with porencephaly and in patients with schizencephaly  <cit> . pign encodes a protein involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis, and recently a missense mutation has been found in patients with an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by dysmorphic features and multiple congenital anomalies together with severe neurological impairment, chorea and seizures leading to early death  <cit> . atm gene encodes a protein belonging to the pi3/pi4-kinase family and functions as a regulator of a wide variety of downstream proteins, including tumor suppressor proteins p <dig> and brca <dig>  somatic mutations in this gene have been identified in t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia  <cit> , while germline mutations have been found associated to increased susceptibility to early-onset breast cancer  <cit>  and risk of glioma and meningioma  <cit> .

this brief list of variants which contains genes associated with severe disorders might represent an underestimate of the relevance of rra. the analyses reported in the results section show that there is huge amount of other genes and regulatory regions containing rra. failure to identify these rra could seriously limit the identification of disease-causing variants in mendelian and polygenic disorders and driver genes in cancer studies.

to overcome the limits of currently available variant callers, we developed therefore rarevator, a novel tool that interrogates all the rra loci and detects variants that contain the reference allele. rarevator is able to identify germline variants in single- and multi-samples experiments  as well as somatic variants in pairs of matched tumor and normal samples . the use of our tool on a publicly available whole-exome sequencing cancer dataset demonstrated its uniqueness in the identification of germline and somatic variants: rarevator was able to identify more than  <dig> germline and  <dig> somatic rra variants that we demonstrated to participate to significantly mutated pathways. the results obtained by rarevator on this very small dataset emphasize the importance of our tool for reanalyzing the huge amount of hts data generated in the last few years and aligned against the human reference genome grch <dig> for complementing the results obtained with classical variant callers in hts-based studies. moreover, although the grc corrected almost all the rra insertions and a significant fraction of snvs and deletions for which the reference allele has never been observed, a large number of functionally relevant rras still remain unchanged in the latest version of the human reference genome. this will make of rarevator a valuable instrument for complementing the results of classical variant caller also for the analysis of future sequencing data that will be aligned against the grch <dig> assembly.
