BACKGROUND
thriving mainly in marine environments, prasinophytes constitute an heterogeneous assemblage of unicellular green algae that occupy the earliest-diverging lineages of the chlorophyta, i.e. the division of the viridiplantae containing the bulk of extant green algae . sister to the chlorophyta is the streptophyta, which comprises freshwater green algae, the so-called charophytes, and all their land plant relatives. given their basal positions, prasinophytes hold the key to understanding the nature of the last common ancestor of all green plants and the origin of the core chlorophytes . the first green plants were undoubtedly unicellular algae bearing nonmineralized organic scales on their cell body and/or their flagella, because flagellated cells of many prasinophytes and streptophytes are covered by a layer of square-shaped scales  <cit> . prasinophytes exhibit considerable diversity with respect to cell shape and size, flagella number and behavior, mitotic and cytokinetic mechanisms, and biochemical features such as accessory pigments and storage products . they include the smallest free-living eukaryote known to date . some prasinophytes lack flagella, others lack scales, and in some cases, both flagella and scales are absent .

analyses of the nuclear-encoded small subunit  rrna gene  have identified nine monophyletic groups of prasinophytes, known as clades i through ix . most of these clades correspond to existing orders or classes; clades ii, iii and iv have recently been ranked at the class level . clades viii and ix, the two most recently identified clades, are composed uniquely of environmental sequences  <cit> . the interrelationships between prasinophyte clades are still uncertain, considering that most of the internal branches separating these clades in 18s rdna trees received weak support values. only for the class chlorodendrophyceae , which is nested within the core chlorophytes, is there confidence that it represents the latest divergence in the prasinophyte radiation. six clades , clade vi , and clades vii through ix) display picoplanktonic species , two of which  exhibit both the coccoid  and flagellated cell organizations. it appears therefore that small-sized prasinophytes evolved multiple times from larger ancestors, presumably because selection favored smaller cells with less requirements per cell for nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements and a reduced tendency to be captured by filter-feeding predators  <cit> .

comparative analysis of chloroplast genomes has been helpful to resolve various issues concerning the relationships among green algal lineages . to date, complete chloroplast genome sequences have been described for six prasinophytes that represent four distinct clades: clade i , pyramimonas parkeae
 <cit> ; clade ii, monomastix sp. oke- <dig>  <cit> , micromonas sp. rcc  <dig>  <cit> , and ostreococcus tauri
 <cit> ; clade iii, nephroselmis olivacea
 <cit> ; and clade v, pycnococcus provasolii
 <cit> . these genomes display considerable fluidity in overall structure, gene content, and gene order. whereas the 200-kb n. olivacea genome harbors the largest gene repertoire yet reported for a chlorophyte  and has retained many ancestral gene clusters, the genomes from the clade-ii members belonging to the mamiellales, which are the smallest  and most compact chlorophyte chloroplast dnas  known to date, display a reduced set of genes  whose order is highly scrambled. the 80-kb pycnococcus and 114-kb monomastix genomes  resemble their ostreococcus and micromonas homologs in featuring a reduced derived pattern of evolution, while the 102-kb pyramimonas genome is more alike nephroselmis cpdna in harboring conserved genes unrecognized in other chlorophytes  as well as a dna primase gene putatively acquired from a virus. like most of their chlorophyte and streptophyte counterparts, the n. olivacea, pyramimonas and the two mamiellalean cpdnas possess two identical copies of a large inverted repeat  that are separated by single copy  regions. the quadripartite architecture of the n. olivacea and pyramimonas cpdnas is ancestral , whereas the gene partitioning pattern observed for the two mamiellalean algae is highly derived.

analysis of  <dig> concatenated chloroplast genes and encoded proteins from  <dig> taxa provided new insights into prasinophyte evolution even though the relationships among all prasinophyte clades could not be explored  <cit> . the inferred phylogenies disclosed a sister relationship between the mamiellophyceae and pyramimonadales and also offered compelling evidence that the green algal partner in the secondary endosymbiosis that gave rise to euglenids was a member of the pyramimonadales. consistent with this proposed sister relationship, the mamiellophyceae and pyramimonadales form a weakly supported clade in the ml tree reported by nakayama et al.  <cit>  on the basis of 18s rdna data; however, these two monophyletic groups are recovered as neighboring lineages in most published 18s rdna trees. the most important discordance between the chloroplast and 18s rdna trees concerns the position of nephroselmis: the branch occupied by this genus represents the earliest divergence in chloroplast trees but is part of a later-diverging group of prasinophytes  in 18s rdna trees. remarkable differences in the branching order of prasinophyte lineages were also observed between 18s rdna trees and a phylogeny of  <dig> green plants inferred from complete cpdna-encoded rrna operon sequences lineages  <cit> . the nodes separating most major prasinophyte lineages in the latter chloroplast phylogeny received weak levels of support.

in the present investigation, we have sequenced the chloroplast genomes of five picoplanktonic prasinophytes belonging to two clades that have not been previously sampled for chloroplast genome analysis, clades vi  and clade vii. we have also examined the cpdna of nephroselmis astigmatica, a clade-iii member representing a lineage distinct from nephroselmis olivacea . these genome sequences were compared with those of previously examined prasinophytes in order to gain more information on the relationships among prasinophyte lineages and on chloroplast genome evolution. our phylogenomic analyses revealed that the branching order observed for the six examined prasinophyte clades is largely congruent with previously reported 18s rdna trees  <cit>  but in contrast to the latter trees, most internal nodes received robust support. the genomes of all the newly investigated picoplanktonic prasinophytes are economically packed and substantially smaller than those observed for prasinophytes with larger cell size, further confirming the notion that small cells have small genomes. unexpectedly, we found that the three picoplanktonic species occupying the deepest branch  harbor several chloroplast genes not previously documented for chlorophytes.

RESULTS
the six prasinophyte chloroplast genomes sequenced in the course of this study differ extensively from one another at several levels. their gene maps are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and their structural features are compared with those previously observed for six other prasinophytes in table  <dig>  the newly investigated cpdnas of picoplanktonic species belonging to clades vi and vii vary in size from  <dig>   to  <dig>  bp , encode between  <dig>  and  <dig> genes  that are densely packed, and with the exception of the picocystis cpdna , contain no ir encoding the rrna operon. the representative of clade iii, nephroselmis astigmatica, exhibits a larger and more gene-rich genome that encodes  <dig> genes and displays an ancestral quadripartite structure. at the level of gene content, important differences were found within and between clades . although pairwise genome comparisons revealed that numerous genes form conserved clusters , gene order is substantially scrambled in all three sampled lineages and multiple ancestral clusters are disrupted in clades vi and vii .figure  <dig>

because an accurate phylogenetic framework is essential to track the suite of cpdna changes that took place during prasinophyte evolution, we will present our phylogenomic analyses of concatenated cpdna-encoded proteins before elaborating further on the structural features of the newly sequenced prasinophyte genomes.

the phylogenies inferred from cpdna-encoded proteins are essentially congruent with the branching order of prasinophyte clades in 18s rdna trees
a data set of  <dig>  unambiguously aligned positions was assembled from  <dig> cpdna-encoded proteins of  <dig> chlorophytes and  <dig> streptophytes, the streptophyte sequences being used as outgroup. amino acid sequences rather than nucleotide sequences were chosen for our phylogenomic analyses because, in analyses of ancient divergences, amino acid data sets are less prone than nucleotide data sets to saturation problems, convergent compositional biases and convergent codon-usage biases . the amino acid data set of  <dig>  positions was first analyzed using phylobayes and the site-heterogeneous catgtr + Γ <dig> model of amino acid substitutions. this model is known to provide a better fit than site-homogeneous models, thus minimizing the impact of systematic errors stemming from the difficulties to detect and interpret multiple substitutions . the majority-rule consensus tree resolved six independent lineages for the  <dig> sampled prasinophytes . we observed with high bootstrap proportion  and posterior probability  support that the three picoplanktonic species belonging to clade vi  occupies the earliest branch of the chlorophyta and that the representatives of clades i and ii  form a clade representing the second deepest divergence. as expected, the two nephroselmis species are allied , forming the third deepest branch of the tree, a branch also robustly supported. the next divergence is represented by the clade-v member, pycnococcus; the relative position of this lineage is uncertain as it received the lowest bp support . the two remaining prasinophytes, picocystis and prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig>  which have both been assigned to clade vii, form separate and robustly supported lineages, with the latest diverging lineage being occupied by prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig>  the latter lineage is sister to a 100% bp supported clade containing the ulvophyceae, trebouxiophyceae and chlorophyceae  and of these classes, only the chlorophyceae is resolved as a strongly supported monophyletic group. even though the branching order of lineages within the utc clade is in agreement with a previous chloroplast phylogenomic study  <cit> , this topology might not reflect the true organismal relationships as taxon sampling is sparse .figure  <dig>

the amino acid data set of  <dig>  positions was also analyzed using raxml under the gcprev + Γ <dig> and lg4x models, with each model applied to the data set partitioned by gene. lg4x is a mixture model based on four substitution matrices  <cit> , whereas gcprev is an empirical model derived from green plant chloroplast sequences  <cit> . the recovered trees were found to be essentially congruent with the bayesian tree obtained under catgtr + Γ4; however, the interrelationships between the prasinophyte lineages were weakly to moderately supported . indeed, all prasinophyte lineages, except the prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig>  received bp support lower than 72%. given this result, we asked whether ml trees inferred from an amino acid data set with a larger number of characters  could provide better support for the relationships among prasinophyte lineages. this second data set was assembled from  <dig> cpdna-encoded proteins of  <dig> chlorophytes and two streptophytes, and trees were inferred using pylobayes under the catgtr + Γ <dig> model and raxml under gtr + Γ <dig>  lg4x, and gcprev + Γ <dig> . in all phylogenies, the branching order of prasinophyte lineages was identical to that shown in figure  <dig>  and higher bp support values were observed for the positions of the early-diverging prasinophytes lineages  as compared to the ml analyses of the original amino acid data set.figure  <dig>

systematic errors are common in phylogenetic studies not only when taxon sampling is sparse but also when some of the taxa produce long branches  <cit> ; indeed, these long branches tend to associate erroneously with those of other taxa showing high sequence divergence, yielding the long-branch artifact  <cit> . in this context, we note that three of the four prasinophyte lineages occupied by picoplanktonic species, i.e. prasinococcales, pycnococcus and prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig>  display longer branches than the other prasinophyte lineages. it is unlikely, however, that the branching order reported here for prasinophyte lineages was hampered by the long-branch attraction phenomenon because the phylogenies we inferred using various models, including the heterogeneous model of evolution catgtr + Γ <dig>  are essentially identical and that their topology is congruent with the branching order of major prasinophyte lineages in nuclear-encoded ssu trees  <cit> . furthermore, it seems improbable that the prasinophyte relationships resolved in our study were affected by convergent compositional biases and convergent codon-usage biases because we found that the reported amino acid-based phylogenies are congruent with the raxml tree inferred from a fully degenerated nucleotide data set obtained by substituting the nucleotides with ambiguity codes that allow for all possible synonymous changes .

our chloroplast phylogenomic trees differ from phylogenies based on 18s rdna data by the sister relationship identified for the pyramimonadales and mamiellophyceae  <cit> , the positioning of the pycnococcaceae after the emergence of the nephroselmidophyceae  <cit>  and the finding that the two representatives of clade vii are not allied  <cit> . in the 18s rdna trees reported by guillou et al.  <cit>  and marin and melkonian  <cit> , the pyramimondales diverge before the mamiellophyceae but support for this earlier divergence is very low. considering that the branch leading to pycnococcus  received weak support in both the chloroplast and 18s rdna trees, the differences related to the relative position of this lineage are also not unexpected. note here that 18s rdna trees either resolve the pycnococcaceae as an earlier divergence compared to the nephroselmidophyceae  <cit>  or group these two lineages in a poorly supported clade  <cit> . likewise, in light of the weak support observed for clade vii in 18s rdna trees as well as in the analysis of the chloroplast rdna operon by marin and melkonian  <cit> , resolution of picocystis  and prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig>  as neighboring lineages in our phylogenomic analyses does not necessarily represent an inconsistency.

considering that the prasinophyte clades iv, viii and ix were not sampled in our study, a number of other issues could not be addressed concerning the interrelationships between the major prasinophyte clades. representatives of clade iv  would be expected to affiliate to the core chlorophytes , although the exact position of clade iv within this group is still unclear. concerning the clades viii and ix, which were defined uniquely by environmental 18s rdna sequences, sampling of these groups will await the availability of algal cultures in public collections. because these clades appear to be loosely affiliated with the nephroselmidophyceae and pycnococcaceae, respectively  <cit> , analyses of chloroplast genomes from representative species would be very helpful to resolve the position of the pycnococcaceae.

the small, ir-less cpdnas of the clade-vi picoalgae  feature six genes not previously documented in chlorophytes
the small sizes of the three examined prasinococcalean chloroplast genomes  are accounted for by losses of genes and of the ir, tight packaging of the retained genes and the absence of introns . with  <dig> to  <dig> genes, prasinococcus, prasinoderma, and prasinophyceae sp. mbic  <dig> have lost numerous genes compared to nephroselmis olivacea  but not as many as the tiny prasinophytes from clades ii and v . most importantly, these prasinococcaleans have retained six genes that have not been previously identified in other chlorophytes: ndhj, rbcr, rpl <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  and ycf <dig> . some of these picoalgae also feature genes that were reported only in the chloroplast of nephroselmis olivacea  or pyramimonas . of the three prasinococcaleans examined, the earliest-diverging taxon  displays the largest gene repertoire. its  <dig> genes include the genes encoding all  <dig> subunits homologous to the mitochondrial nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase , whereas the cpdnas of prasinoderma and prasinophyceae sp. mbic  <dig> are entirely lacking these genes. furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the trne  gene coding for glutamyl-trna, which is a crucial rna component not only for protein synthesis but also for chlorophyll synthesis  <cit> , is duplicated in the chloroplasts of prasinoderma and prasinophyceae sp. mbic  <dig>  duplication of trne  also occurred prior to the divergence of the chlamydomonadales and sphaeropleales   <cit> ; however, whether the acquisition of the extra gene copy conferred a biological advantage is still unknown. note that another trna gene, trnl , is duplicated in prasinophyceae sp. mbic  <dig> 

the set of six chloroplast genes found in the prasinococcales but missing in all other chlorophyte clades provides independent support for the ancestral status of the prasinococcales within the prasinophyte lineages. this is because positioning of the prasinococcales as the first branch of the chlorophyta, rather than as a later divergence, yields the most parsimonious scenario of losses for these six genes, all of which, except ndhj, are predicted to have been lost only once. according to this scenario, ndhj sustained loss not only just after the emergence of the prasinococcales but also in the lineage leading to the prasinophyceae sp. mbic  <dig> 

in terms of gene order, the prasinoderma and prasinophyceae sp. mbic  <dig> cpdnas more closely resemble each other  than do the prasinococcus cpdna and each of the former genomes  . most of the chloroplast gene clusters that are usually shared between streptophytes and chlorophytes have been preserved in prasinococcaleans ; one notable exception is the rrna operon which has been fractured between rrs  and trni  in prasinococcus. the newly identified rps <dig>  rps <dig> and ndhj genes reside in the same gene context as their streptophyte counterparts and some of the missing genes  appear to have been cleanly excised from ancestral gene clusters.

the ancestral quadripartite structure of nephroselmis astigmaticacpdna features an ir three-fold smaller than its n. olivaceahomolog
prior to this study, the ir-containing chloroplast genome of nephroselmis olivacea  was known to be the prasinophyte cpdna with the most ancestral pattern of evolution. its main attributes include a quadripartite structure very similar to those of the streptophyte algae mesostigma
 <cit>  and chlorokybus
 <cit> , a large gene repertoire, and an ancestral gene organization  <cit> . the impressive size of its ir , however, represents an unusual feature. although it carries several additional conserved genes relative to its pyramimonas counterpart  <cit> , which is more than three-fold smaller, two separate regions totaling about 27 kb lack any genes typically found in cpdnas. based on analyses of a + t content and base composition of resident orfs, it was suggested that these ir regions were acquired by lateral transfer  <cit> ; this hypothesis was substantiated by the subsequent discovery that the orf <dig> encodes a putative protein with the conserved domain of phage associated dna primases  <cit> .

recent 18s rdna phylogenies have uncovered multiple lineages in the nephroselmidophyceae  <cit> . in the present study, sampling of nephroselmis astigmatica, a representative of a lineage distinct from nephroselmis olivacea, enabled us to gain insight into the stability of the quadripartite structure and ancestrally inherited gene clusters of cpdna in the nephroselmidophyceae. compared to its nephroselmis olivacea counterpart, the nephroselmis astigmatica cpdna has a much reduced size , which is mostly accounted for by a smaller ir . at  <dig>  bp, the ir of this species is comparable in size to that observed for pyramimonas but is almost twice as large as that found for the mamiellaleans ostreococcus and micromonas. although the irs of the two nephroselmis species differ in gene content in the region upstream of the rrna operon, some of the genes downstream of this operon are conserved , chln, and chll, see figure 2). a notable difference concerns the location of trnl : this gene lies at the immediate border of the large sc region in the nephroselmis astigmatica ir ; in contrast, it occurs near the small sc region in the nephroselmis olivacea ir. considering that trnl  is usually included within the large sc region in other green plant cpdnas having an ancestral quadripartite structure , the presence of this gene upstream of the rrna operon in the nephroselmis astigmatica ir can be simply explained by the expansion/contraction of the ir through gene conversion events  <cit> . with regards to the two sc regions, the gene content of each in both nephroselmis cpdnas fully conforms to the ancestral gene partitioning pattern. given the conventional size of the nephroselmis astigmatica ir, the presumably viral sequences in the nephroselmis olivacea ir were likely captured specifically in the lineage containing the latter species. in this lineage, trnl  switched position relative to the rrna operon, probably by two successive inversions of internal ir sequences containing this operon. positional changes of genes from one side of the rrna operon to the other appear to have been frequent during chlorophyte evolution, as they have been observed for other chloroplast genomes displaying slight deviations from the ancestral quadripartite structure  and two extra ones are present ) . all of these nine genes display sporadic distributions in the other chlorophytes examined thus far. interestingly, trnv  is reported for the first time in chlorophyte cpdnas; it is encoded not only in the nephroselmis astigmatica cpdna but also in the picocystis  genome.

the two nephroselmis genomes share  <dig> blocks of colinear sequences that include a total of  <dig> genes  . the largest conserved clusters, which extend from rpl <dig> to petd and from trnw  to ycf <dig>  contain  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. the nephroselmis astigmatica genome contains several ancestral gene linkages that are missing in nephroselmis olivacea and the prasinococcales -5′ndhc, see figure 5). conversely, we find ancestral gene clusters in nephroselmis olivacea that are missing from nephroselmis astigmatica and prasinococcalean species -5′ftsh, 5′rpl20-5′trnd ); however, they are less abundant, indicating that ancestral gene linkages have undergone a higher degree of erosion in the nephroselmis olivacea lineage.

while nephroselmis olivacea is lacking any intron in its chloroplast, nephroselmis astigmatica harbors two group i introns. these introns are found in the same genes as the five group i introns in monomastix cpdna  rrna gene or rrl and psba). the nephroselmis astigmatica rrl intron is inserted at site  <dig> relative to the escherichia coli 23s rrna and like its monomastix counterpart at the same site, it encodes a putative laglidadg homing endonuclease gene . on the other hand, the nephroselmis astigmatica psba intron lacks an orf and occupies an insertion site  that has not been previously reported for any green plant organelle intron.

the cpdnas of the two clade-vii representatives display contrasting patterns of evolution
because the picoalgae picocystis and prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig> are allied in 18s rdna trees  <cit> , their chloroplast genomes were expected to exhibit more similarity to each other than to their homologs in other prasinophyte clades. even though they are both very densely packed with genes, they greatly diverge at the levels of their overall structure, gene content and gene order . at  <dig>  bp, the prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig> cpdna is the smallest chloroplast genome yet reported for a photosynthetic green plant. it lacks an ir and its  <dig> genes display a strong bias in distribution between the two dna strands: two long segments containing  <dig> and  <dig> genes, all encoded on the same dna strand, are separated from another by two smaller stretches of genes encoded on the opposite strand .

in contrast, the  <dig> -bp picocystis genome is more gene-rich , contains a  <dig> -bp ir, and does not exhibit any pronounced strand bias in gene distribution . as revealed by the gene contents of the sc regions, the quadripartite structure of this genome deviates considerably from both the ancestral gene partitioning pattern observed for the nephroselmis cpdnas and the derived quadripartite structure of the ostreococcus and micromonas genomes  <cit> . the gene repertoire of the picocystis chloroplast, which displays  <dig> genes that are missing from its homolog in prasinophyceae ccmp  <dig>  includes ten ndh genes as well as three genes that have been identified thus far only in members of the nephroselmidophyceae and/or prasinococcales ) .

the picocystis and prasinophyceae ccmp  <dig> cpdnas show a low level of synteny. twelve blocks of colinear sequences containing  <dig> genes  are conserved between these genomes ; they consist uniquely of ancestral gene clusters that are present in most streptophyte and chlorophyte genomes. none of the two picoalgae exhibits an intact rrna operon: even though the genes making up this operon are located in the picocystis ir, the rrl and rrf  genes have been rearranged, and like its pyramimonas homolog, the rrf gene of prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig> appears to be missing . of the two clade-vii cpdnas, that of picocystis clearly displays the highest degree of ancestral characters at the gene order level and in that regard, it also surpasses its prasinococcalean counterparts .

while no introns are found in the prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig> cpdna, a trans-spliced group ii intron occurs in the picocystis genome. the presence of this intron is somewhat puzzling, considering that, as observed for the prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig> lineage, the chloroplast genome has been extensively streamlined in the lineage leading to picocystis. the picocystis intron is inserted within the ycf <dig> gene at the same site  as one of the cis-spliced ycf <dig> introns found in charophytes and land plants  <cit> . it is split into two pieces that are  <dig>  kb apart in the genome and occur as separate transcription units . the fragmentation site lies within domain iv of the potential intron secondary structure , a common feature of trans-spliced group ii introns  <cit> . like most trans-spliced introns of this group, the picocystis ycf <dig> intron lacks an orf. given that its domain i is degenerate and that the two pieces flanked by exon sequences must be assembled in trans at the rna level through base-pairing interactions to yield a catalytically active intron structure, one or more nuclear-encoded factors are probably required to facilitate splicing. we have provided experimental evidence by rt-pcr analysis that the picocystis intron is spliced properly and that the ycf <dig> gene sequence is continuous at the rna level .figure  <dig>

.  potential intron secondary structure modeled according to michel et al.   <cit> . exon sequences are shown in lowercase letters. roman numbers specify the six major structural domains. tertiary interactions are denoted by dashed lines, arrows, or greek letterings. ebs and ibs are exon-binding and intron-binding sites, respectively. the asterisk indicates the site of lariat formation. note that the precise position of the breakpoint within domain iv is unknown.  confirmation of intron trans-splicing by rt-pcr analysis. the diagrams on the left display the genomic configuration of the picocystis ycf <dig> exons , with the trans-spliced intron sequences shown as color gradients. primer locations are indicated by numbered arrows ; the numbers in parentheses denote the nucleotide positions corresponding to the 5′ ends of the primers on the ycf <dig> coding sequence after intron removal. coding regions shown above or below the horizontal line are transcribed to the right or to the left, respectively. pcr assays were carried out on cdna or genomic dna , with the numbers above the gel lanes indicating the combinations of primers used. the amplicon derived from the pcr assay on cdna is of the size expected if intron trans-splicing occurs to produce the ycf <dig> rna. the identity of this amplicon as well as the insertion position of the intron in the ycf <dig> gene were confirmed by dna sequencing. the amplicons derived from the pcr assays on gdna have the sizes predicted by the genome map.



among the viridiplantae, chloroplast trans-spliced group ii introns have been identified in streptophytes , including charophytes  <cit> , and in representatives of all five major evolutionary lineages of the chlorophyceae  . trans-splicing of the tripartite group ii intron in the psaa gene of the chlorophycean green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii  has been shown to be dependent upon at least  <dig> nuclear-encoded factors  <cit> . our finding of a trans-spliced intron in a prasinophyte organelle is not unprecedented, as two trans-spliced group i introns have been uncovered in the mitochondria of prasinoderma
 <cit> . both bipartite introns of this tiny prasinophyte occur within the lsu rrna gene at positions where cis-spliced relatives containing homing endonucleases genes are found in organelles of other algae and as observed for other trans-spliced group i introns and even trans-spliced group ii introns, the intron breakpoints correspond to the same region where the orf occurs in cis-spliced orthologs. all trans-spliced organelle introns arose undoubtedly from cis-spliced orthologs that were fractured by genome rearrangements  <cit> . it is possible that breakage of the cis-spliced ancestor of the picocystis ycf <dig> intron  occurred when the chloroplast genome was less gene-dense and the intron carried a large loop in domain iv, because this would have offered better opportunities for recombination. subsequently, the trans-configuration of the intron would have conferred increased resistance to intron loss by retroprocessing, owing to the lower probability that homologous recombination of a reverse transcribed mature ycf <dig> mrna with the distant exons generates an intronless version of the gene. therefore, its trans-configuration probably explains why it survived in the streamlined chloroplast genome of picocystis.

CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenies we inferred in this study enhance our understanding of the relationships among prasinophyte lineages. they are congruent with the branching order of prasinophyte lineages in nuclear-encoded ssu rdna trees, even though the two clade-vii members analyzed, picocystis and prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig>  form independent lineages instead of a clade, in the chloroplast trees . only the position of the pycnococcaceae relative to the other prasinophyte lineages examined could not be resolved with confidence.

in addition to providing support for the placement of the prasinococcales in the deepest branch of the chlorophyta, our comparative analysis of chloroplast genomes underscores the high variability in genome architecture among prasinophyte lineages, highlighting the strong pressure to maintain a small and compact chloroplast genome in picoplanktonic green algae. on the basis of the chloroplast phylogenomic trees we inferred, the ir was lost on at least four occasions during prasinophyte evolution . considerable changes in the gene partitioning pattern of the ancestral quadripartite structure took place in two separate picoplanktonic lineages . in the nephroselmidophyceae, the chloroplast genome retained a quadripartite structure of the ancestral type but the ir changed considerably in size and gene content through gain of horizontally transferred sequences , shifts of ir boundaries, and relocalization of trnl  relative to the rrna operon. although many genes sustained independent losses in multiple prasinophyte lineages, the prasinococcales have retained a set of six genes that are missing in all other chlorophytes examined so far. the widely divergent traits uncovered for the genomes of the picoalgae picocystis and prasinophyceae sp. ccmp  <dig> are consistent with the placement of these two clade-vii members in separate lineages. the  <dig> -bp ir-less cpdna of the latter alga is the smallest chloroplast genome yet reported for a photosynthetic green plant. the ycf <dig> intron of the tiny picocystis is, to our knowledge, the first chloroplast trans-spliced intron documented for prasinophytes; it is also the only intron known in the chloroplast of a picoplanktonic chlorophyte.
