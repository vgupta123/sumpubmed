BACKGROUND
mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the etiological agent of enzootic pneumonia , a chronic respiratory disease affecting mainly grow-finishing pigs  <cit> . m. hyopneumoniae infections have been detected in almost all countries with intensive production systems and are responsible for major economic losses in the pig industry  <cit> . these economic losses are due to pig growth retardation, higher feed conversion ratios, increased antimicrobial use and increased susceptibility to other respiratory pathogens such as pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, trueperella pyogenes and streptococcus suis  <cit> . m. hyopneumoniae is also an important pathogen involved in the porcine respiratory disease complex   <cit> .

control of m. hyopneumoniae infections can be achieved in a number of ways, such as optimizing management and housing conditions, antimicrobial medication and vaccination. in many countries, more than 70 % of pig herds are vaccinated against m. hyopneumoniae in an effort to control the disease  <cit> . vaccination with commercial bacterins has been extensively proven to reduce performance losses, the severity of clinical signs and lung lesions . different vaccination schemes can be implemented, depending on the type of herd, the production system, the infection pattern and the preference of the farmer.

currently, both double and single vaccination strategies are widely practiced. single vaccination is often administered either at 1 week of age or at weaning. vaccination is often done at weaning because the piglets are handled then anyway, so vaccination can easily be included in routine farm management practices  <cit> . on the other hand, weaning is one of the most stressful events in the pig’s life  <cit> . the piglets are then experiencing the abrupt separation from the sow, they are being handled, they are being moved to other facilities, they are usually being mixed with other pigs, and they are receiving a different type of feed  <cit> . stress may interfere with an optimal response to vaccination, and therefore it is generally recommended not to vaccinate animals that are severely stressed  <cit> .

consequently, one important question that remains to be answered, and whose answer could contribute to the optimization of existing vaccination schemes, is whether the efficacy of vaccinating against m. hyopneumoniae can be influenced by the weaning process when vaccination is applied at the day of weaning. the objective of this trial was to investigate the efficacy of a one-shot vaccination applied either at weaning or three days before weaning in pigs experimentally infected with a virulent m. hyopneumoniae field strain.

RESULTS

discussion
the present experimental trial investigated whether the efficacy of one-shot vaccination is influenced by the weaning process. differences between v <dig> , v <dig>  and the pcg  were small and mostly statistically not significant, except for the microscopic lung lesions, which were lower in v <dig> 

apart from the transport related to the weaning process, the piglets in the present study were also transported to the experimental facilities, a trip that lasted anywhere from one-half to two hours. in fact, age- and site-segregated pork production is a complex process that involves movement of the piglets from the farrowing house to the nursery facilities, which are situated in different locations  <cit> . it can be expected, though, that the stress imposed on the piglets in our study may have been greater than when the piglets remain on the same site and are not transported   <cit> .

vaccination at the moment of weaning, when the piglets are being handled anyway, is a common practice, as it can be implemented easily in the daily management of a pig herd. the pigs of v <dig> were vaccinated three days before weaning. this vaccination strategy is also commonly practiced by some pig producers in order to avoid any possible negative effects of the weaning process, and/or to avoid too much handling or interventions on the same day  <cit> . a difference of three days between the two vaccination groups most probably allowed sufficient time for the development of the first and most critical steps of the immune response prior to the stress of weaning  <cit> . at the same time, too great a difference in age at vaccination was avoided between the piglets in the v <dig> and v <dig> groups. in this sense, the two vaccination schemes are relevant for the situation in many pig herds.

the experimental infection model used for m. hyopneumoniae was similar to that used in previous trials . challenge infection proved to be successful since the vast majority of the infected pigs had positive qpcr values, exhibited the presence of mycoplasma-like macroscopic lung lesions at necropsy and were positive for if staining. however, the macroscopic lung lesions observed in the present trial were milder compared to trials that had been previously conducted using the same inoculation dose of m. hyopneumoniae f <dig> c field strain, experimental facilities and way of allocation . the precise reasons for this difference are not known. based on the macroscopic lung lesion scores, serology, qpcr testing and if staining, all the pigs in the negative control group were negative for m. hyopneumoniae throughout the trial, thus confirming that the study piglets were free of m. hyopneumoniae.

the rds values in the pcg were similar to those mentioned in other experimental trials  <cit> . compared with the vaccinated groups v <dig> and v <dig>  the only differences found in the pcg were numerical. there were no significant differences in adg between the groups. this is mainly due to the high standard deviations observed and the limited numbers of pigs. adg was measured, but it was not considered an important parameter for this experimental study. in vaccination trials under field conditions however, in which many more animals can be included, adg is an important parameter.

group v <dig> had the lowest numbers of macroscopic and histopathological lung lesions, and the lowest if scores when compared to groups v <dig> and pcg. nevertheless, significant differences between groups v <dig>  v <dig> and pcg were only obtained for the histopathological lung lesions. this was confirmed by the results of the percentage of air parameter in the lung tissue measured by means of an automatic image analysis system. the statistically significant differences between groups v <dig>  v <dig> and pcg proved that m. hyopneumoniae vaccination is effective in reducing lymphohistiocytic infiltration and increasing the percentage of air in the lung. this reduction of the lymphohistiocytic infiltration scores in the vaccinated groups is in accordance with previous experimental trials  <cit> . the less severe histopathological lesions may be due to a modulation of the immune response in vaccinated animals. it has been shown that vaccination with a bacterin against m. hyopneumoniae reduces the infiltration of macrophages in the lung tissue  <cit> .

although lower qpcr values were recorded in the vaccinated groups when compared to the pcg, it was not possible to conclude whether vaccination was associated with the reduced bacterial load in the lungs, since the differences between the groups were only numerical. however, the detection of m. hyopneumoniae in the bal fluid of groups v <dig> and v <dig> confirms that vaccination alone is not able to prevent colonization of the pig’s respiratory tract  <cit> .

the pigs of groups v <dig>  v <dig> and pcg were seronegative for m. hyopneumoniae on the day of transportation to the experimental facilities. at the time of inoculation, 40 % of the pigs in each of the vaccinated groups v <dig> and v <dig> had seroconverted. this is in agreement with other studies which have reported that vaccination with commercial bacterins induces seroconversion rates ranging from  <dig> to 100 %  <cit> . at necropsy, all the pigs in groups v <dig> and v <dig> were seropositive, while the percentage of pigs that had seroconverted in group pcg was 95 %.

overall, no firm conclusions could be made as to whether group v <dig> performed better than groups v <dig> and pcg, since only the microscopic lung lesions were significantly lower in the pigs in group v <dig>  further research under field conditions is necessary to elucidate the possible effect of weaning on the efficacy of one-shot m. hyopneumoniae vaccination. field trials make it possible to include more animals and to study the entire course of m. hyopneumoniae infections up to the time of slaughter.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the differences between the vaccinated groups v <dig> and v <dig> were small and mostly statistically not significant. thus, no firm conclusions could be made as to whether the process of weaning had a negative impact on the efficacy of vaccinating against m. hyopneumoniae. a future field trial could possibly provide further insight on the same topic.
