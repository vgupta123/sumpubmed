BACKGROUND
lactic acid bacteria  are historically defined as microaerophilic, gram-positive organisms that produce lactic acid during homo- or heterofermentative metabolism of carbohydrates. their ability to ferment hexoses makes them of great use in industrial applications to transform milk, meats and vegetables into fermented products. their biosynthetic pathways are at the origin of a variety of flavors, textures and preservative qualities of fermented foods. industrial applications of lab rely on six key beneficial and nonpathogenic species
 <cit> . among them, lactococcus lactis is the main source of mesophilic starter strains used for the production of different kinds of cheeses, fermented milks and cultured butter. the great economic importance of this species makes it a significant bacterial model for the study of anaerobic sugar catabolism
 <cit> . the formation of lactic acid from lactose, of diacetyl from citrate and its proteolytic activity are the three main lactococcal traits of interest for milk fermentation and aroma compound formation in dairy products, notably the underlying genes for these traits are all plasmid encoded.

l. lactis strains are divided in two subspecies designated as l. lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris <cit> . as an excellent model for research on bacterial metabolism and for the development of new applications, l. lactis genomics developed quickly with the availability of the first complete genome sequence of lactococcus strain, l. lactis lactis il1403
 <cit> . currently, eleven complete l. lactis genomes are available with six strains belonging to the subspecies lactis and five to the subspecies cremoris. the complete genomic sequence of l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg <dig> was released by wegmann et al. <cit>  and revised by linares et al. <cit> . most l. lactis mutants have been constructed from strain mg <dig> and its derivatives. many studies using these mutants focused on studying heme-respiration
 or carbohydrate metabolism
 <cit>  but few give global transcriptome profiles in response to environmental stresses. recently, carvalho et al.
 <cit>  presented the effect of acid stress on the glucose metabolism of non-growing cells of l. lactis mg <dig> using nuclear magnetic resonance  and microarrays and de jong et al.
 <cit>  performed temporal transcriptome analysis during growth of l. lactis mg <dig> in milk. global transcriptomic analysis in response to technological stresses, e.g. acidification and oxygen, have mostly been performed on strain il <dig> and its derivatives
. specific studies of l. lactis mg <dig> are still needed to be able to understand its responses to technological stresses.

many physiochemical parameters, such as temperature, ph, water activity and pressure, affect l. lactis metabolism during cheese manufacture and are measured for quality control purposes. additional parameters, such as the oxido-reduction potential, called redox potential , and the concentration of dissolved oxygen
 <cit> , are of growing interest to the dairy industry. the concentration of dissolved oxygen is exponentially correlated to the redox potential
 <cit>  and changes constantly during cheese manufacturing. oxygen is especially present at the very beginning of growth, when the milk is pumped and then stirred before coagulation. it has been shown that high initial levels of dissolved oxygen in milk can drastically delay acidification by lactococcus starter strains
 <cit> . cachon et al.
 <cit>  observed that l. lactis reduces milk prior to acidification. reduction of milk by l. lactis is due both to oxygen consumption and a decrease of redox potential when oxygen disappears. experimental data and genomic analyses indicate that l. lactis is able to cope with oxidative stress in a similar way to the aerobic model bacteria escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. l. lactis is relatively tolerant to oxygen and shows a great capacity to adapt to an oxygenated environment. in the presence of oxygen and heme, l. lactis is even able to respire and as a result, cell survival is improved and population is increased
 <cit> . however, these heme conditions do not occur naturally. in an aerated environment, l. lactis is able to consume oxygen, resulting in an altered redox state and in a shifted carbon metabolism towards mixed fermentation
 <cit> . however, studying the literature, several knowledge gaps can be identified, e.g. no study focused on the early exponential phase of growth when starter strains are exposed to oxidative stress, and no study took into account the redox potential values and the dissolved oxygen concentrations in relation to growth kinetics, metabolomic and transcriptomic data.

the aim of this study was to understand the adaptation of l. lactis to an initial oxidative stress, as encountered during the cheese-making process, at the transcriptional and metabolic levels in relation to the acidification kinetics and growth conditions. whole genome transcriptome analysis of l. lactis mg <dig> was performed at four time points  during a 24 h period of growth and combined with a time-course quantitative analysis of produced metabolites by nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy. a derivative of l. lactis mg <dig>  carrying the plp <dig> plasmid, was grown in a medium containing lactose under two oxygen conditions: initial hyper-oxygenized medium , to mimic the environment of a cheese-making process, and in oxygen-depleted medium .

RESULTS
lactococcus lactismg <dig> underwent a drastic loss of culturability in condition o2
the kinetics of growth , acidification , reduction  and dissolved oxygen consumption  were monitored over 24 h for two conditions: initial hyper-oxygenized condition  and no oxygen condition  . despite completely different gas conditions, no differences could be observed during the exponential growth phase, while substantial differences in culturability could be observed during the stationary growth phase. we defined  <dig> stages based on the oxygen concentration during growth under condition o <dig> . in stage a, the medium was initially saturated with oxygen  and the bacteria were in the early exponential growth phase , with minor changes in the ph  and the redox potential . in stage b, oxygen had totally been consumed and both culture media  were anaerobic; bacteria were between mid- and late-exponential growth phase, the rate of acidification was at a maximum level and the redox potential decreased drastically since the oxygen concentration dropped abruptly to 0%. until the strain mg <dig> reached the stationary growth phase, its kinetics of growth and acidification was not affected by oxygen. stage c started when the cells entered the early stationary growth phase reaching the maximum population density; acidification kinetics in conditions o <dig> and n <dig> were superimposed until a minimum ph was reached. in contrast to condition n <dig>  the oxygen concentration in condition o <dig> increased again up to 50%, leading in turn to an increased redox potential. this increase of oxygen occurred because the bioreactor head-space was still filled with pure oxygen which dissolved into the lm <dig> medium and was presumably no longer consumed by the cells at this stage. finally, during stage d the dissolved oxygen concentration stabilized at 50% of the initial value in condition o <dig> while there was still no oxygen detectable in condition n <dig>  the l. lactis mg <dig> was then in the late stationary growth phase, the minimum ph was reached  and the redox potential was stable . the main difference between the two conditions occurred during this stage: the culturability loss was much higher under condition o <dig>  than under condition n <dig> .figure  <dig>

transcriptomic analysis was performed on the whole genome of strain mg <dig>  differentially expressed  genes in condition o <dig> in comparison to condition n <dig> were determined at different time points corresponding to stage a , stage b , stage c  and stage d . all de genes are described in the supplementary data  and de genes discussed in the text are gathered in table

 <dig> represents the number of de genes per known cog category, for each time point except 24 h . the adaptation to oxygen strikingly occurred at 1 h  of culture . all the cog categories were represented, indicating a global adaptation to oxidative stress. moreover, cog categories c , e , f  and o  were specifically over-expressed in condition o <dig>  clearly indicating that the cellular and energetic mechanisms were particularly affected at this early stage of growth. only a small number of de genes were observed at 5 h , most of which  were under-expressed, probably because during stage b the absence of oxygen led to similar oxygen environment in both conditions o <dig> and n <dig>  between  <dig> and 6 h of culture. in stage c , while dissolved oxygen increased again in the condition o <dig>  only  <dig> genes were de, of which  <dig> were under-expressed, indicating that the gene adaptation to oxygen observed in stage a did not occur despite the presence of oxygen.table  <dig>

the carbon metabolism is shifted to aerobic metabolism at an early stage of growth under condition o2
as a type of homolactic bacteria, l. lactis produces mainly lactic acid from pyruvate, using glucose or lactose as carbon sources. however, other metabolites are simultaneously produced to a lesser extent from pyruvate using metabolic pathways dependent on culture conditions such as the oxygen level . lactococcus lactis mg <dig> displayed no differences in lactate dehydrogenase expression, under the two conditions o <dig> and n <dig>  besides this main pathway, the other pathways were affected under the condition o <dig>  genes pdha-d, als and aldc, respectively encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase, acetolactate synthase, and alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase, were found to be over-expressed in condition o <dig> at 1 h . using rt-qpcr, genes pdha and aldc were also found to be over-expressed at 5 h and 8 h . it should be noted that the gene lpll, coding for a lipoate-protein ligase, which is adjacent to the pdh genes, also displayed an over-expression. on the contrary, under condition o <dig>  genes adhe and fdhc , respectively encoding alcohol acetaldehyde-dehydrogenase  and formate dehydrogenase , were under-expressed at 1 h. the gene pfl, encoding pyruvate formate lyase , responsible for the carbon flux from pyruvate to the formate/ethanol pathway , was over-expressed at 5 h  indicating a switch from the aerobic to the anaerobic metabolism  during stage b. finally, the gene frdc, coding for a flavoprotein involved in the reduction of fumarate to succinate, was under-expressed at 1 h.figure  <dig>

as a consequence of this early adaptation at the gene level, the metabolism was different under the two conditions 3 h into growth for most of the minor products derived from lactose. the metabolomics analysis performed using nmr analysis allowed to identify  <dig> metabolites . among them,  <dig> metabolites of major importance in the carbon metabolism of lactococcus lactis had different kinetics of consumption or production under the two conditions. figure 
 <dig> shows their kinetics  at  <dig> time points over the 24 h-period. lactose was not totally consumed at the end of the culture and its kinetics of consumption was not significantly different between the two conditions. lactate was the main fermentation product in both conditions, with yields reaching  <dig>  and  <dig>  mol lactate per c6−mol of sugar consumed under conditions o <dig> and n <dig>  respectively. on the contrary, minor products such as acetate, formate, ethanol and  <dig> -butanediol displayed significantly different production kinetics under conditions o <dig> and n <dig> . while formate and ethanol were produced more under condition n <dig>  acetate,  <dig> -butanediol and acetoin were produced more under condition o <dig> . the differences in these kinetics were observable, at the  <dig> or 5 h time point, and increased steadily over the whole 24 h-period, except for acetoin, which was increasingly transformed into  <dig> -butanediol from 5 h onwards.figure  <dig>

genes involved in the response to oxidative stress were all de early in the exponential phase, but not later
genes involved in the response to oxidative stress and in electron transport were predominantly and highly expressed at 1 h . these genes code for proteins involved in oxygen detoxification, electron transport and maintenance of the cell’s redox state. among all, the gene which displayed the highest over-expression was noxe coding for the nadh oxidase responsible for the conversion of molecular o <dig> to h2o. over-expression of noxe was confirmed by rt-qpcr at 1 h but not at  <dig> and 8 h  indicating that this response only occurred in the early exponential phase. genes involved in the transport of electrons displayed the same pattern: over-expression at 1 h but not later for gene menf involved in the synthesis of the menaquinone c  and  <dig> out of  <dig> genes of the fhu operon coding for the ferrichrome abc transporter . however, high expression  of the fhud gene was confirmed by rt-qpcr at 1 h and to a lesser extent at 5 h and 8 h of culture . the nucleotide reductases encoded by the nrd genes were part of the early adaptive response to hyper-oxygenized conditions, as all six nrd genes were over-expressed at 1 h with fold-changes ranging from 4- to 16-fold. rt-qpcr confirmed over-expression of the nrdh gene at 1 h, and - but to a lesser extent - at  <dig> and 8 h . other genes such as the genes involved in the control of the redox state of the cell, e.g. reduction of thiols , reductases  or a non-heme chloride peroxidase  which plays a role in the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide to water, were over-expressed at 1 h.

conversely, oxygen-sensitive genes such as nifj and llmg_ <dig> were found to be under-expressed at 1 h. transport proteins were also under-expressed: cada coding for a cation transporting atpase, dtpt and eric coding for di-/tri-peptide transporter and for chloride transporter proteins, respectively. the under-expression of cada was confirmed at 1 h using rt-qpcr, while later, at 5 h and 8 h, it was found to be over-expressed . genes encoding redox-sensing regulators such as rex and trma were also found to be under-expressed under condition o <dig> .

conjugation was repressed by the presence of dissolved oxygen both at the transcriptomic and phenotypic levels
nine genes belonging to the l. lactis mg <dig> sex-factor
 <cit> , a 60 kb chromosomally located conjugative element capable of high-frequency dna transfer
 <cit> , were under-expressed in condition o <dig> . the adaptive down-regulation of these genes by oxygen was most pronounced after 8 h of growth in agreement with the global adaptation at the transcriptomic level observed in this study. interestingly, we observed that transfer frequency of the sex-factor was more than  <dig> times higher under static conditions  than under aerated conditions , thereby confirming that conjugal transfer is increased in limiting oxygen concentrations.

discussion
lactococcus lactis is widely used as a starter in the dairy industry. during cheese-making, it is exposed to oxidative stress, e.g. during stirring, in the early stages of manufacture. l. lactis is known to be tolerant to oxygen. however, the non-respiratory response to oxygen, at the transcriptomic and metabolic levels, has never been described for the early stages of growth. the present results clearly showed that a high initial level of dissolved oxygen in lm <dig> does not affect the growth of strain mg <dig> during the exponential phase, due to an efficient adaptive response at the transcriptional level occurring early in the exponential phase. on the contrary, when the level of dissolved oxygen increased again during the stationary growth phase, the cells suffered a dramatic loss of culturability, while the adaptive response at the transcriptional level was almost absent. this is the first study to simultaneously monitor growth and ph, but also oxygen concentration and redox values, which proved to be important as oxygen concentration varied a lot during growth.

the growth and acidification of l. lactismg <dig> were not affected by oxygen during the exponential growth phase due to efficient oxygen consumption
the same growth and acidification kinetics were displayed under conditions o <dig> and n <dig> during the first hours, proving that strain l. lactis mg <dig> has an efficient system to deal with oxygen. it has previously been shown that the presence of dissolved oxygen does not significantly affect growth of l. lactis strains either in lm17
 <cit> , or in milk
 <cit> . in comparison to anaerobic conditions, the strain mg <dig> could grow to an even higher population maximum  under microaerobic conditions
 <cit> . acidification kinetics and final redox values were the same, so oxygen did not affect the main technological abilities of the strain mg <dig>  however, other properties could have been affected. in contrast, it has been reported that l. lactis subsp. lactis chcc <dig> acidified to a lesser extent under aerated conditions
 <cit> . furthermore, wild strains of lactococci can reach ph  <dig>  in milk with 4– <dig> hours delay under the condition o <dig> in comparison to condition n2
 <cit> . the resistance to oxygen of the strain mg <dig> is most probably due to its efficient oxygen consumption, clearing all oxygen from the media within 4 h. as a result, the redox potential showed a marked decrease. the minimum redox values  reached by strain mg <dig> were typical for lactococcus strains in milk with a minimum value between -200 mv and -280 mv
 <cit> . interestingly, these values were also reached under condition n <dig>  in the absence of dissolved oxygen, giving evidence of a reducing activity independent from the presence of oxygen as previously observed
 <cit> . reduction of the culture medium by l. lactis mg <dig> indeed occurred in two consecutive steps under condition o2: an aerobic reduction with complete oxygen consumption during stage a and an anaerobic reduction with a decrease in eh <dig> values after oxygen has disappeared.

l. lactismg <dig> displays multiple resistance systems in response to oxygen at 1 h
the most important and noticeable adaptation to oxygen was the early over-expression of detoxification and electron transport genes. all these genes code for enzymes protecting cells from damage provoked by reactive oxygen species. evidence for two independent systems of reduction in l. lactis was shown
 <cit> . the first one is noxe; it is an oxygen-dependent system, responsible for the majority of oxygen consumption during the exponential phase, but its ph-sensitivity led to its inactivation during the stationary phase when ph decreased. the second system is oxygen-independent; it is composed of menaquinones  that form part of the electron transport chain  and noxab, both responsible for the anaerobic reduction of the medium after oxygen consumption. however, in the present study, the gene menf  was over-expressed at 1 h of culture at the same time as noxe and not later, suggesting that this enzymatic system is also part of the early adaptation to oxygen. these results are in accordance with pedersen et al.
 <cit> , who found that noxe was the most de gene in aerobic conditions, along with  <dig> of the men genes. in contrast to the work of pedersen et al.
 <cit> , our results show that the soda gene coding for the superoxide dismutase  was not de at 1 h. the difference of experimental conditions may partly explain why the gene soda was not de in our conditions. in our conditions, the medium was initially saturated with dissolved oxygen while the medium was constantly aerated in pedersen et al. <cit> ; the transcriptomic analysis was performed at od =  <dig> in pedersen et al. <cit>  instead of od =  <dig>  in our study. furthermore, the strain used for the transcriptomic analysis in pedersen et al. <cit>  was not strain mg <dig>  it has been recently shown that activities of nadh oxidase and sod are strain dependent
 <cit> .

for the first time, the early over-expression of nucleotide reductase nrd genes of both classes  is described as a crucial part of the response to oxygen. the genes nrddefghi were all over-expressed. the nrd family of proteins is responsible for the reduction of ribonucleotide di- and tri-phosphates and thereby provides the building blocks for dna replication and repair
 <cit> . the nrdefhi proteins are class i enzymes, which are oxygen-dependent, while the nrddg system belongs to the class iii enzymes, which can be active under anaerobiosis
 <cit> . under condition o <dig>  the most over-expressed operons were nrdhi and nrdef which is consistent with the fact that they are oxygen-dependent. the ribonucleotide reductase nrdef uses nrdh as an electron transporter
 <cit> . surprisingly, the nrddg operon, which encodes an anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase, was also over-expressed at 1 h, albeit to a lesser extent than the other nrd genes
 <cit> .

another family of genes responsible for the efficient early adaptation to oxygen of strain mg <dig> is the reductase and thioreductase family  maintaining the intracellular thiol balance
 <cit> . in bacillus subtilis, two genes, trxa  and trxb , are transcriptionally induced under conditions of thiol-specific oxidative stress
 <cit> . in l. lactis, these genes were not found to be over-expressed under aerated conditions at 4 h of culture by pedersen et al.
 <cit> . the gshr gene  was consistently over-expressed in o2-rich conditions as previously observed. strain mg <dig> is unable to synthetize glutathione but has been shown to display a high glutathione reductase activity on glutathione-rich medium such as lm <dig> medium
 <cit> , which could then protect against oxidative stress. the redox state is regulated by several genes when oxygen is present in the culture. the rex  gene is under-expressed in our study. rex, widely spread among bacteria
 <cit> , notably controls the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism and fermentative growth in several bacteria in response to the intracellular redox potential . the trma gene, under-expressed in our conditions, is one of the eight genes of the family of trm genes in mg1363
 <cit>  and a member of the spx family of proteins
 <cit> . spx of b. subtilis acts as a transcriptional regulator and senses redox conditions. it has been shown that a mg <dig> trma mutant was more resistant to stress with an increased proteolysis capacity
 <cit> . other genes involved in the electron transport by fe-proteins such as nifu and fhucdg, which code for ferrichrome abc transporters for heme transport
 <cit> , were over-expressed. the fhucdg genes had not been described as over-expressed under oxidative stress
 <cit>  or aerated conditions
 <cit> . rather our results suggest that these genes, as well as other genes involved in adaptation to oxygen such as trxb <dig> , are part of an early and transitory response of l. lactis to oxygen.

finally, two genes, choq and chos, coding for transport proteins of the osmoprotectant choline , were over-expressed suggesting overlap of stress responses as previously observed
 <cit> . the over-expressed genes llmg_ <dig>  llmg_ <dig> and llmg_ <dig> are similar to genes ymgg, ymgh and ymgi, respectively encoding two proteins similar to gls <dig> family general stress protein and a transmembrane protein that were found to be induced by aerated conditions
 <cit> . it is of interest that llmg_ <dig> is located next to the integrase of a prophage in mg <dig> and the gene environment may differ in other strains.

lactose fermentation of l. lactismg <dig> remains homolactic
lactococci essentially produce lactic acid as a main end product
 <cit> . in the present study, the mg <dig> strain produced about the same concentration of lactate under the conditions o <dig> and n <dig>  however, in agreement with the literature
 <cit> , part of the carbon flux or pyruvate flux is directed to mixed-acid fermentation pathway ending with metabolites such as acetate and aroma compounds  under oxidative conditions. as pfl is irreversibly inactivated under aerated conditions
 <cit> , the pyruvate pool is deviated to the pdh  and als  activities forming acetate and acetolactate, respectively. this pathway increases the atp yield by acetate production. in parallel to the nadh oxidase activity, l. lactis oxidizes nadh into nad+ with the two enzymes, α-acetolactate decarboxylase and  <dig> -butanediol dehydrogenase, responsible for acetoin reduction into  <dig> -butanediol
 <cit> . the metabolic shift observed is likely a result of the under-expression of frdc and adhe and the over-expression of pdhabd, als and aldc genes. however, the production of these metabolites was observable two hours after the observed shift at the gene expression level. interestingly, pedersen et al.
 <cit>  did not mention the over-expression of these genes, suggesting this could be part of the very early adaptation of l. lactis to oxygen as mentioned above.

l. lactismg <dig> adaption to oxygen disappeared in the stationary phase
in stages c and d, in condition o <dig> only, the oxygen concentration increased again to up to 50% of the initial value. instead of a novel adaptation, we observed a drastic loss of culturability of the mg <dig> cells. on one hand, such a loss of culturability does not exist in milk
 <cit> , not even for the mg <dig> strain grown under the same conditions in milk . on the other hand, growth in m <dig> is most often monitored as od and not colony forming unit enumerations
 <cit> . consequently, to our knowledge, this drastic loss of culturability of l. lactis cells has not been reported before. other strains of l. lactis  exhibited a loss of culturability after carbon exhaustion in m <dig> medium
 <cit> . strains mg <dig> and ml <dig>  are closely related and differ with regards to their chromosomal topography due to different chromosomal inversions
 <cit> . in our study, carbon consumption stopped at very low concentrations  but starvation was not observed during stage d under either condition. the loss of culturability observed in the present study may thus be due to oxidative stress only in combination with acid stress, and carbon source limitation might be a contributing factor. in milk, the loss of culturability does not occur because the increase of oxygen is extremely limited during the stationary growth phase and the lactose concentration was still high
 <cit> .

surprisingly, conjugation is repressed in the presence of oxygen
the sex factor of the strain mg <dig> contains  <dig> putative genes
 <cit> ,  <dig> of which are predicted to encode proteins that are evolutionary conserved between  <dig> ancestrally related gram-positive coccal conjugation systems
 <cit>  and are suggested to be part of a minimal set of genes required for conjugation. among those genes, orf <dig> and orf <dig> were found to be under-expressed under conditions o <dig> at time point 8 h. we anticipated that in the presence of oxygen, a reduction of their expression and possibly of the other  <dig> genes would translate into a reduction of the sex-factor transfer efficiency. we show here that conjugal transfer is indeed increased 5-fold in limiting oxygen concentrations. these results are the first to describe the repression of the sex-factor conjugation under aerated conditions. this surprising result is in conflict with the common belief that conjugation facilitates adaptability of the cells to environmental stress

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first aiming to investigate adaptation to oxygen by combining phenotypic , transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses over a 24 h-period of culture. it is very interesting to observe how uncorrelated the results of these different analyses could be. while no differences were visible at the phenotypic level during the exponential phase , major differences occurred at the transcriptomic level, revealing a strong adaptation of l. lactis to the oxygen present. on the contrary, while transcriptomic profiles did not reveal major difference between conditions o <dig> and n <dig> in stationary phase, a strong loss of culturability was observed under oxygenated conditions. the present results were obtained for a lac+/prt+ strain directly derived from the strain mg <dig>  while strain mg <dig> is regarded as a model organism representative of lactococcus lactis, its behavior may not truly mirror that of an industrially used cheese starter culture. in all cheese-making processes, the milk is stirred during the first stages of the process, so oxygen is present early rather than later on. it is thus important to report that strains of the most used starter, l. lactis, are able to adapt to the presence of oxygen early in the exponential growth phase, when oxidative stress is most likely to occur. it is of major importance to understand how key technological abilities such as acidification and reduction of the medium are preserved in the presence of early oxidative stress.
