BACKGROUND
angiosperm sexual reproduction starts when pollen is transferred from the anther to the stigma. after hydration and germination, the pollen tube carrying two sperm cells enters the embryo sac through the micropyle of the ovule and penetrates one of the synergid where it discharges its contents. one sperm cell fuses with the egg cell and the resultant zygote develops into the embryo. the central cell unites with the second sperm cell to form a triploid primary endosperm cell that develops into the endosperm  <cit> . thus, the double fertilization event initiates the development of two interconnected multicellular structures, the diploid embryo and the triploid endosperm. embryogenesis patterning starts with an asymmetric cell division that produces a small apical cell, that ultimately becomes the embryo, and a large basal cell  that functions to provide nutrients from the endosperm to the growing embryo  <cit> . embryogenesis in higher plants can be divided conceptually into three overlapping phases  <cit> . the first phase involves morphogenesis and pattern formation, during which the polar axis of the plant body is defined by specification of the shoot and root apices, and the embryonic tissue and organ systems are formed . during the second phase , storage reserves start to accumulate in the maturing embryo, and, in the third phase, the embryo prepares for desiccation and enters a period of developmental arrest. successful embryogenesis thus leads to seed development. in arabidopsis embryogenesis is rapid, requiring only  <dig> days after pollination to produce the desiccated mature seed  <cit> . in solanaceous species, embryogenesis spans a much longer period. for example, in solanum phureja, embryo maturation, excluding desiccation, is only completed  <dig> days after pollination  <cit> .

classification of gene expression patterns associated with specific stages of embryo and seed development and functional understanding of the encoded genes are critical for understanding the molecular and biochemical events associated with embryogenesis. most of the knowledge concerning the genetic program activated during embryogenesis of higher plants comes from the study of mutants. several mutants affecting embryonic development were identified in numerous plant species including a. thaliana, maize, rice, and tomato through various mutagenesis strategies  <cit> . these analyses enabled the identification and characterization of several genes that play key roles in plant embryonic development. however, mutagenesis strategies alone cannot identify all of the genes that are potentially involved in a biological process.

in the past few years, several differential screening techniques  have made it possible to characterize genes differentially expressed during embryogenesis  <cit> . more recently, other methods such as transcriptional profiling have allowed us to visualize global changes in transcript abundance in a spatial, temporal or conditional way. genome-wide transcription profiling is an important and powerful tool leading to the generation of testable hypotheses for novel processes not yet characterized at the molecular level. its usefulness has been demonstrated in the investigation of transcriptional programs occurring in a variety of developmental processes such as fruit ripening, seed development, flower development, embryo development, defense response to pathogens, and the response to wounding  <cit> . now that the technology has matured, microarray data are routinely correlated with other methods that measure rna expression levels  <cit> .

recently we completed a medium scale est sequencing project from normalized cdna libraries made from solanum chacoense ovules in order to identify signal transduction components involved in fertilization and early seed development  <cit> . solanum chacoense, a diploid  and self-incompatible close relative of the potato and tomato, produces a large numbers of easily isolated ovules inside a fleshy tomato-like fruit. it also bears tubers, albeit small, like all the members of the solanum petota section, and is also considered an important source of interesting genetic traits for its high resistance to more than  <dig> pests and diseases  <cit> . flowers of s. chacoense are actinomorphic with a 5-lobed calyx and corolla, five stamens, and a 2-carpellate superior ovary. s. chacoense display homomorphic self-incompatibility of the gametophytic type involving s-rnases. the presence of a gametophytic self-incompatibility barrier was used to dissect the molecular events occurring at precise time points following pollination and fertilization since it enables synchronization of fertilization. these est were used to construct cdna microarrays consisting of  <dig>  cdnas spotted in duplicate, which were used to investigate the regulation of gene expression during fertilization and early seed development events from  <dig> to  <dig> days after pollination . our aims were to: 1) identify genes expressed in a tissue-specific and temporal-specific manner; 2) define clusters of genes showing similar patterns of spatial and temporal expression; and 3) identify stage-specific or transition-specific candidate genes for further functional analyses.

methods
solanum chacoense cdna clones and inserts amplification
we have previously used a subtraction screen on two cdna libraries covering embryo development from early fertilization events  to ovules bearing late torpedo stage embryos as a method to produce an est pool enriched for weakly expressed messenger rnas. from roughly  <dig>  colonies spotted on nylon membranes,  <dig> colonies that displayed a hybridization signal corresponding to the lowest 20% were selected for further analyses.  <dig> good sequences were obtained and these comprised  <dig> unigenes  <cit> . inserts of these cdna clones were pcr amplified using flanking primers complementary to vector sequences upstream and downstream of the cdna inserts. plasmid templates  were added to  <dig> μl pcr mixture containing  <dig>  mm of each nucleotide,  <dig> μm of each primer,  <dig>  mm of mgcl <dig> and  <dig> units of taq dna polymerase. inserts were amplified for  <dig> cycles , with an initial denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> min and final extension at 72°c for  <dig> min. two  μl of each reaction were separated on  <dig> % agarose gels to confirm amplification quantity and quality. pcr products were purified using multiscreen® pcr <dig> filter plates , and lyophilized. in general, the amount of each pcr product was greater than  <dig> μg and the average insert size was around  <dig> bp.

cdna microarray preparation
pcr products were resuspended in  <dig> μl of 50% dmso and arrayed from  <dig> well microtiter plates onto ultragaps™ slides . a total of  <dig> ests spotted in duplicate along with a variety of controls, including buffer-only spots and a dilution series of a plasmid harboring the candida albicans ece <dig> gene.

plant materials and rna isolation
the diploid  and self-incompatible wild potato species solanum chacoense bitt. was greenhouse grown with an average photoperiod of 14- <dig> h per day. the genotypes used were originally obtained from the usda agricultural research service, nrsp- <dig> potato genebank . plant material was collected from female progenitor, s. chacoense genotype g <dig>   <cit> . for fertilization-related events, the fully compatible s. chacoense genotype v <dig>  was used as pollen donor. plants were hand pollinated and ovules were collected between  <dig> and  <dig> days after pollination  and used for rna extraction and probe preparations. leaf, style and anther tissues were collected from plant genotype g <dig> grown under the same conditions as above. all samples for rna preparation were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a powder with a mortar and pestle. total rna was extracted using the trizol® reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol . the yield and purity of rna were assessed by determination of absorbance at both  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm. rna was only used when the ratio abs <dig> nm/abs <dig> nm was higher than  <dig> . rna integrity was checked by both agarose gel 1% and with the rna  <dig> nano assay kit and the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer. rna from unfertilized ovules served as control.

design of microarray experiments
to monitor the expression pattern from genes involved in fertilization and embryogenesis processes, flowers were hand-pollinated and ovules were isolated every two days during a  <dig> days period after pollination. four independent biological replicates were produced from each time points. in addition, to isolate genes specifically or predominantly expressed in ovules, four biological replicates of leaf, anther, and style tissue mrna preparations were individually hybridized against unfertilized ovule mrnas and compared with the data obtained from unfertilized and fertilized ovules at various time points after pollination. to estimate reproducibility and to produce control data for statistical analysis, a large number of unfertilized ovules were isolated and separated between seven independent control groups. rna from randomly selected pairs of control was hybridized on six microarrays.

preparation of fluorescent probes
thirty  μg of total rna,  <dig>  μl oligo  <dig> , and water to a volume of  <dig> μl was denatured at 65°c for  <dig> min and cooled to room temperature for  <dig> min. the reverse transcription reaction was performed at 42°c for  <dig> h after addition of  <dig> μl dntp-minus dctp ,  <dig> μl dctp ,  <dig> μl dtt ,  <dig> μl 5× first strand buffer ,  <dig> μl of cyanine 3-dctp  or cyanine 5-dctp  and  <dig> μl of superscript ii . after incubation at 42°c,  <dig>  units each of rnase a and rnase h  were added and the reaction mix was incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min. the probes were then purified using cyscribe gfx purification kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. incorporation efficiency of the cydye probes was measured using the nd- <dig> nano drop spectrophotometer . in general, optimal amounts are  <dig> pmol of dye incorporated with an incorporation efficiency of between 20- <dig> labeled nucleotides per  <dig> nucleotides. probes were then air-dried.

hybridization
slides were prehybridized at 42°c for at least  <dig> hour, with  <dig> μl of a solution containing 5× ssc,  <dig> % sds and 1% bsa. the two cdna targets were pooled together, and mixed with the hybridization buffer to a volume of  <dig> μl dig ease hybridization buffer ,  <dig>  μl trna  and  <dig>  μl of sonicated salmon sperm dna . the hybridization solution was heat denatured at 95°c for  <dig> min, cooled to room temperature, and applied onto the dna microarray slides for overnight hybridization at 42°c. to account for the possibility of dye bias, half of the hybridizations were performed in the cy3/cy <dig> configuration, and half in the cy5/cy <dig> configuration. the microarray slides were covered with a  <dig> × 60-mm glass coverslip . during all hybridization steps the hybridization chamber was kept at high humidity level. immediately before hybridization, the dna microarray slides were washed twice with  <dig> × ssc at room temperature for  <dig> min and once with water for  <dig> sec and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the dna microarray slides were kept dry for a minimal amount of time before hybridization. afterward, slides were completely immersed in a large volume of washing buffer, and the coverslips were carefully removed before washing twice for  <dig> min at 42°c with 1× ssc,  <dig> % sds, twice for  <dig> min at 37°c with  <dig> × ssc,  <dig> % sds, and finally, with quick consecutive washes in three  <dig> × ssc baths. dna chips were air dried and stored protected from light until scanning.

microarray scanning and data analysis
the dna microarray slides were scanned with a scanarray lite microarray scanner  at 10-μm/pixel resolution. the fluorescence intensities were quantified with quantarray software . microarray data normalization and analysis was performed in genespring gx software version  <dig>  . raw intensities were normalized with a lowess curve using 20% of the data to fit each point. to identify transcripts with a significant change in abundance, the fluorescence ratios from each time point were compared to the fluorescence ratios from  <dig> control hybridizations using the welch t-test and the benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate. we selected genes with a p-value ≤  <dig>  and further restricted the lists to transcripts whose change in abundance was greater than 2-fold. the use of such a stringent gene selection method that uses both multiple testing correction and a fold-change cutoff did not significantly affect our conclusions. genespring gx was also used for hierarchical clustering and to detect significant overlaps between gene lists. functional categorization was performed according to the gene ontology  consortium and arabidopsis consortium information . translated s. chacoense sequences were sorted into  <dig> functional categories by sequence comparison. the data discussed in this publication have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus  <cit>  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> .

real-time pcr
cdna samples were synthesized from  <dig> μg of  <dig> independent preparations of total rna using the superscript® ii reverse transcriptase . the rna was denatured at 70°c for  <dig> min. the total volume was adjusted to  <dig> μl by adding  <dig> μl of 5× rt buffer,  <dig> pmoles of oligo dt  <dig> primer,  <dig> μl of  <dig>  mm dtt,  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm dntp,  <dig> units of superscript® ii reverse transcriptase and  <dig> μl of water. the mixture was then incubated  <dig> hour at 42°c. the resulting first strand cdna was used for real-time pcr amplification experiments. ovule rnas from three different developmental stages  were compared. rnas from unfertilized ovules were used as the calibration tissue. duplicate quantitative assays for each tissue were performed with the sybr green master mix  according to the manufacturer's instructions. for real-time pcr amplification, the following pcr program was used: 50°c for  <dig> min, 95°c for  <dig> min, 95°c for  <dig> s, 60°c for  <dig> min; steps  <dig> and  <dig> were repeated  <dig> times in mx4000® multiplex qpcr system . the relative quantification analysis was performed using the comparative ΔΔct method  <cit> . to evaluate the gene expression level, the results were normalized using an ubiquitin gene  as control. primer sequences used in real time quantitative pcr are summarized in additional file  <dig> 

tissue fixation and optical microscopy observation
ovules were fixed in faa for  <dig> h at 4°c . samples were then dehydrated in an increasing series of ethanol baths . microscopic observations were taken on an axioimager m <dig> microscope equipped with an axio cam mrm camera .

RESULTS
microarray spotting and evaluation
we have previously generated expressed sequence tags  derived from fertilized ovule cdna libraries covering embryo development from zygote to late torpedo stages in solanum chacoense bitt  <cit> . the  <dig> ests corresponded to weakly expressed mrnas obtained through a subtraction selection screen that produced a highly enriched unigene set  corresponding to 82% of the total ests sequenced. to provide a glimpse into the ovule transcriptome during embryogenesis in a solanaceous species and to identify a subset of ovule-specific and stage-specific genes comprising this transcriptome, these ests were used to construct amplicon-based cdna microarrays. in the present study, we used a comparative expression profiling strategy to analyze gene expression profiles in ovules from  <dig> to  <dig> days after pollination.

for microarray production, the ests were amplified by pcr with vector-specific primers. the pcr products were purified, verified for single clone amplification, normalized, and arrayed onto aminosilane-coated glass surfaces. to increase the reliability of the detected signals, each pcr sample was spotted twice resulting in  <dig>  data points for each array. several controls were also spotted to verify the reliability of our hybridization. after each spotting runs, samples of printed arrays were visualized with a fluorescent dye to control evenness of dna deposition and spot morphology.

sixty-two  hybridizations corresponding to  <dig> experiments were performed . twelve experiments consisted of the comparison of ovule tissues harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after pollination  with unfertilized ovules . to determine the percentage of genes specifically or predominantly expressed in ovules, three experiments that compared rna from unfertilized ovules to leaf, style, and anther tissues were also conducted. due to the large amount of control tissue material needed for each time point comparison and for each replicate , the control rna obtained were pooled from different replicates and used for comparison with the various time points and other tissues. pooling rna before labeling has the advantage of reducing the variation due to biological replication and sample handling  <cit> . to estimate this variation we also competitively hybridized cdna probes from six additional control samples collected from unfertilized ovule against the pooled control. the six individual control samples were different from the pooled one that was used as the universal control in all our experiments. the correlation coefficient between the normalized intensities of the two channels was of  <dig> , and only few spots showed occasional differences in intensities above 2-fold . this very high correlation coefficient gives a strong indication that biological replication is not a significant source of variation. for each experiment, four biological replicates were collected from the same greenhouse and from a large number of plants. for each individual replicate, all the necessary material was collected at once. each hybridization was performed against the pooled control rna sample . to account for the possibility of dye bias, half of the hybridizations were performed in the cy3/cy <dig> configuration and half in the cy5/cy <dig> configuration.

expression profiling of genes involved in fertilization and embryogenesis
to monitor gene expression profiles during fertilization and early embryogenesis, total rna samples from uo to  <dig> dap were isolated, labeled, and hybridized to the  <dig>  k microarray. a fraction of the ovules from each sample was set aside and fixed. these ovules were cleared and analyzed by differential interference contrast  microscopy to ensure that homogenous developmental stages were used in the various developmental time points used. strict pollination timing was accomplished through manual pollinations with pollen from a fully compatible s. chacoense genotype on anthesis day. fertilization occurs between  <dig> and  <dig> hours following pollination in s. chacoense  <cit> . since s. chacoense is a self-incompatible species this prevents self-fertilization and eliminates the need for emasculation, which could induce a bias in gene expression through a wounding response. furthermore, since anther dehiscence is not completed at the time of anthesis while the pistil is already fully receptive, this reduces the risk of self-pollen landing on the stigma that could trigger a self-incompatible response.

for each time point, four biological replicates were used, with half labeled as cy <dig> cdna probes and the other half as cy <dig> cdna probes. using anova testing, along with a benjamini and hochberg multiple testing correction algorithm,  <dig> transcripts showed a statistically significant change in abundance  in at least one of the time points compared to the control hybridizations . amongst those,  <dig> showed a greater than ±2-fold variation in expression in at least one of the time points . these differentially expressed genes were grouped according to the similarity of their expression profiles using two dimensional hierarchical clustering   <cit> . these results clearly segregate the dataset amongst three major groups of genes that specify early , middle , and late  stages of embryogenesis . embryonic stages as determined by ovule clearing and microscopical observation encompassing each time point are schematically represented . from  <dig> to  <dig> dap , embryo development corresponded to the post fertilization stages that include embryos from the zygotic stage to 8-celled embryo proper. from  <dig> to  <dig> dap  ovules mainly bore embryos from the  <dig> cell to heart stages, and from  <dig> to  <dig> dap  embryo developmental stages encompassed torpedo, walking stick, and mature embryos.

analysis of genes specifically or predominantly expressed in ovule tissues
to determine the percentage of ovule-specific genes in our est pool, rna samples from leaf, anther, and style tissues of s. chacoense were compared to the uo pool sample. each microarray experiment was performed four times using, in all cases, independently isolated rna samples as starting material . statistical analyses showed that  <dig> genes  showed a significant variation in transcript abundance  in at least one tissue  when compared to uo . a venn diagram analysis of modulated genes from leaves, anthers, and styles shows that, from the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in all tissues compared to ovules;  <dig> genes are differentially expressed only in anthers;  <dig> genes are differentially expressed only in leaves; and  <dig> genes are differentially expressed only in styles. four  genes are co-regulated in leaves and styles;  <dig> genes are co-regulated in leaves and anthers; and  <dig> genes are co-regulated in anthers and styles .

from these  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were up-regulated  and  <dig> genes were down-regulated  when compared to uo . we thus considered that the transcripts corresponding to these  <dig> genes were predominantly expressed in uo. from the  <dig> transcripts that were predominantly expressed in styles, anthers, or leaves,  <dig> genes were also differentially expressed in ovules after pollination but their induction level was less than the one observed in the other tissues tested . a principal components analysis of these genes clearly indicates that the subset of genes expressed in non-ovule tissues is quite different than those expressed in ovules . thus, these results confirm that a large number of the ests on our microarrays can be considered ovule-specific or ovule-predominant. out of the  <dig> genes that showed more than ±2-fold variation in expression after fertilization,  <dig>  are considered specifically or predominantly expressed in ovule tissues.

amongst these genes, a small group  was modulated by more than 100-fold during embryogenesis,  <dig> % of the genes were modulated by ± <dig> to 100-fold,  <dig> % between ± <dig> and 50-fold, and  <dig> % between ± <dig> and 20-fold . the most highly expressed genes comprised almost exclusively genes involved in proteolysis and peak transcript accumulation occurred between  <dig> and  <dig> dap . genes involved in proteolytic function were also highly represented in the ≥ <dig> to 100-fold and ≥ <dig> to 50-fold up-regulated genes and covered various classes of proteases including serine-type peptidases , aspartic-type peptidases, and cysteine-type peptidases. apart from genes involved in proteolysis, other highy up-regulated genes  included numerous lipid transfer proteins  and non-specific lipid transfer proteins  that are involved in various biological processes including plant defense, pollen tube adhesion and guidance, embryo patterning and cell wall biogenesis  <cit> , as well as proteinase inhibitors that are involved in plant defense responses and early seed development  <cit> .

amongst the genes found to be strongly repressed in the following combined categories , most corresponded to genes classified as being involved in stress responses with a high representation of metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor  genes. one such mcpi was characterized by martineau et al.  as being highly expressed in anthesis stage ovaries in tomato  while decreasing quite rapidly during fruit development, with an estimated 10-fold drop  <cit> . the three most similar s. chacoense orthologs to the tomato mcpi were also found in the  <dig> to 20-fold down-regulaetd genes .

functional classification of differentially expressed genes during fertilization and early seed development
the hierarchical gene clustering presented in figure 2b showed that, following fertilization, the ovule-expressed gene pool could be clearly divided into three major groups that specified early, middle, and late stages of embryogenesis. a venn diagram analysis of the genes predominantly expressed in fertilized ovules indicates that  <dig> genes are differentially expressed during the early developmental stage,  <dig> genes only during the middle stage, and  <dig> genes only during the late stage . sixty-six  genes are differentially expressed in early and middle stages,  <dig> genes in early and late stages and  <dig> genes in middle and late stages. sixty  genes are differentially expressed in all embryo development stages . since the ests used to build the microarray were isolated from ovules harvested at various time following pollination, they encompass all different developmental stages of the embryo. the microarray analysis was thus sensitive enough to separate them between the major developmental transitions. this also suggests a highly specific expression program for each separate stage, with little overlap between the three major stages defined.

to determine whether the differentially expressed genes were involved in similar biological processes, transcript profiling data was correlated with the gene ontology classification based on both the s. chacoense sequences and their closest orthologs in arabidopsis thaliana. the functional categories of these genes are given in figure  <dig>  as expected, the largest category in every stage consisted of genes with unknown function or genes with no significant homology/no hit , as observed in fully sequenced genomes  <cit> . for the early and middle stages, the largest functional categories included metabolism , regulation of transcription , energy , signal transduction , protein fate  and proteins with binding functions .

one functional category of genes that was highly overrepresented in the early stage compared to the middle and late stages corresponded to genes related to the cell cycle & dna processing category , probably reflecting the high cell division activity observed in the endosperm that precedes the development of the embryo. in solanaceous species, embryo division starts when the endosperm has reached 24- <dig> cells  <cit> . for the protein biosynthesis category,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in early stage with a large proportion of up-regulated genes . an inverse situation was found in the middle stage, where only  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated out of  <dig> genes for this functional category. interestingly, for the protein fate group,  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> found were up-regulated in the early stage, while  <dig> genes out of  <dig> were up-regulated in the middle stage, suggesting a coordinate inverse regulation of protein biosynthesis and fate during these two stages. for the following gene categories corresponding to development and biogenesis , and transport , the number of transcribed genes was higher in the middle stage when compared to the early stage.

genes associated with nutrient reserves tend to specify the late stage, as expected. the defense and stress responses category was important in all three stages. differentially expressed genes associated with the signal transduction and regulation of transcription classes were almost nonexistent in the late stage, comprising only  <dig> %  of the transcripts while they comprised  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  in early and middle stages respectively.

isolation of stage-specific genes
to characterize in more detail the transcriptional changes taking place between developmental stages, a different analysis was undertaken for each time point during embryogenesis from  <dig> to  <dig> dap. a volcano plot with student's t-test analysis was used to identify genes that were specifically expressed at only one time point when compared to uo  during embryogenesis, with a p value ≤  <dig>  and a ≥ ±  <dig> fold cut-off. depending on the time point chosen, from  <dig> to  <dig> genes were significantly modulated at any single time point and between  <dig> and  <dig> genes were specifically modulated during a single time point . thus, these represent candidates for stage-specific or stage-predominant expressed genes. of particular interest, four time points  had a high proportion  of their genes specifically modulated only at the observed time point. in the early zygotic phase at  <dig> dap,  <dig> of  <dig> modulated genes  were only expressed at this stage. at  <dig> dap, when ovules bear embryos with a 2-cell embryo proper,  <dig> of  <dig> modulated genes  were stage-specific. the last two time points enriched in stage-specific genes are found at the beginning and the end of the middle phase at  <dig> and  <dig> dap, respectively. at  <dig> dap, when ovules bear mostly embryos undergoing transition from a 4-cell to an 8-cell embryo proper  <dig> of  <dig> genes modulated genes  were stage-specific while at  <dig> dap, when ovules bear mostly heart-stage embryos,  <dig> of the  <dig> modulated genes  were stage-specific. thus, although the majority of the genes were differentially expressed during several embryo stages, genes differentially expressed only at a single time point were also found for all stages in variable numbers. additional file  <dig> provides the list of these stage-specific genes. at  <dig> dap, half the stage-specific modulated genes were classified as part of the functional category covering translation. at  <dig> dap, we noted the accumulation of the stress and defense related genes including heat shock proteins  and genes coding for proteins with binding function . the major functional category represented at  <dig> dap was related to energy . a specific group of cell cycle regulation  and chromosome organization and biogenesis  were also found. finally, the  <dig> dap time point was specially enriched in three gene ontology  categories: hormone related genes , signal transduction  and transport .

functional classification of differentially expressed genes in style, anther and leaf
the  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed in other tissues when compared to uo were grouped into different functional categories  according to their predicted gene products, based on the gene ontology  consortium through s. chacoense sequences and their closest orthologs in arabidopsis . apart from a large class of unknown and unclassified proteins , the largest functional groups observed were protein synthesis , metabolism , energy , stress and defense related genes , development and biogenesis , transport , regulation of transcription , signal transduction , proteins with binding function , cell cycle and dna processing , and protein fate .

comparison of the categories found in these tissues and in ovules showed a completely different enrichment in functional categories . whereas globally in ovule tissues , we observed a large proportion of genes related to signal transduction and transcription, a very active cell cycle, and an up-regulation of genes associated with protein synthesis, in the other tissues tested these categories were less represented and even in the most represented category, protein biosynthesis, almost all genes were down-regulated .

validation of microarray data by real-time pcr
in order to confirm the validity of differentially expressed genes identified by cdna microarray analysis, we performed real time rt-pcr experiments on candidates from the three major groups of genes that specify early, middle, and late stages of embryogenesis. quantitative rt-pcr analyses were performed on rna extracted from ovules four days after pollination corresponding to the early stage of embryo development; from ovules  <dig> days after pollination corresponding to the middle stage; and from ovules  <dig> days after pollination corresponding to the late stage. unfertilized ovules were used as the calibration tissue and the ubiquitin amplicon as the internal control to normalize the data. quantitative rt-pcr confirmed the expression pattern for all the nine genes chosen from the microarray analysis: dn <dig>  dn <dig>  dn <dig>  and dn <dig> that specify the early stage of the embryo development; dn <dig>  dn <dig>  and dn <dig> which specify the middle stage; dn <dig> and dn <dig> which specify the late stage . in all cases, the quantitative rt-pcr validation indicated that differential expression detected by microarray experiment was highly reliable.

discussion
until recently, most methodologies used to study the molecular mechanism involved in plant embryogenesis were based on mutagenesis approaches, and were mainly conducted in a few plant species, namely, arabidopsis, rice and maize. these have allowed the characterization of numerous and informative mutants affecting early embryogenesis  <cit> . in recent years, candidate gene studies involving gene-profiling technologies have enabled the global visualization of spatial and temporal differential gene expression patterns, thus being complementary to mutagenesis approaches while also being able to characterize new key genes inaccessible through mutant screens. only few such studies targeting plant embryogenesis have been conducted  <cit> . in this study, we have analyzed for the first time a large transcriptomic dataset of temporal gene expression in ovules from a solanaceous species, s. chacoense, by comparing the gene expression profiles of fertilized ovules versus unfertilized ovules.

apart from slower embryo development, two other major differences between the model plant a. thaliana and s. chacoense should be considered. both refer to early embryogenesis stages. contrary to a. thaliana, which follows the onagrad type, s. chacoense follows the solanad type of early zygote divisions. in both cases, the first division of the zygote is transverse and asymmetrical, giving rise to two cells of different developmental fates. the smaller apical cell gives rise to the embryo proper, while the larger basal cell develops into the suspensor. in a. thaliana the first two divisions of the apical cell are longitudinal, while they are transversal in s. chacoense  <cit> . endosperm also differs in whether nuclear divisions are followed by cellular divisions. three variants are commonly recognized and classified as cellular, nuclear or helobial  <cit> . in cellular endosperms, as found in s. chacoense, cell-wall formation follows the first division of the primary endosperm nucleus . in helobial endosperms, wall formation follows the first pen division, producing two chambers, which vary in subsequent cellularization. in nuclear endosperms, as found in a. thaliana, walls do not develop between the free nuclei.

we have covered the whole embryo development process from zygote to mature embryo and have identified  <dig> genes  that are specifically or predominantly expressed in ovules compared to their expression profile in leaves, styles or anthers. many differentially expressed genes encode proteins with putative regulatory functions, and most of them have not yet been characterized. overall, in ovule tissues, a large proportion of genes related to transport, signal transduction and regulation of transcription were modulated, and an up-regulation of genes associated with cell cycle and protein synthesis was noticed. in the other tissues tested , these categories were less represented and, even in the most represented category, protein biosynthesis, almost all genes were down-regulated . the data obtained indicates that some gene categories are overrepresented in some tissues or organs. interestingly, we found that expression of mads-box, myb, ap2-erebp and yabby transcription factor families were overrepresented in the transcriptional regulation groups during the early and middle stages of embryo development as well as in anthers tissues, but absent in the leaves and style. this suggests that these genes might play an important role in defining structural and functional identity of reproductive tissues. consistent with this, many transcription factors from the above-mentioned gene families have been previously shown to play major roles during plant reproduction  <cit>  and floral organ development  <cit> . therefore, genes identified as being preferentially expressed in a given tissue probably have an important function in this tissue  <cit> .

specific functional category enrichment in the three major embryonic developmental stages
differentially expressed genes in ovules were grouped according to the similarity of their expression profiles using unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithms. clustering results segregated the dataset amongst three major groups of genes that specified early , middle  and late  stages of embryogenesis . this result indicates a clear distinction in transcriptionnal profiles between early, middle and late stages of embryogenesis, as determined with the principal components analysis , the little overlap between the modulated genes , as well as the specific enrichment in the corresponding functional categories . k-means clustering using pearson correlation was also used to separate the expression patterns during the embryo developmental time course. considering that three major expression profiles are found, representing early, middle and late stages of embryonic development, a maximum of nine patterns can be expected . hennig et al.  also proposed nine models of dynamic expression patterns for genes involved in reproductive development in arabidopsis based on three different stages: before, during and after pollination  <cit> . spencer et al.  found that seven distinct expression patterns were present within the apical and basal section of the embryo, during the globular, heart, and torpedo stage embryos  <cit> . the two missing profiles are most probably the consequence of the absence of earlier stages, before the globular stage. when considering less global trends, as depicted in figure  <dig> for stage-specific genes, a higher number of specific and slightly different patterns can be obtained, based on the  <dig> individual time points. figure 9b depicts  <dig> such patterns that can be derived from the analysis of our time-course every second day from  <dig> to  <dig> dap and that include the nine dynamic expression patterns representing early, middle and late stages of embryonic development. although the majority of functional groups are shared between several stages, some of these clusters show specific functional categories enrichment . the first cluster  includes genes involved in protein storage and specifies the late stages of embryogenesis. cluster  <dig> corresponds to the early stage  and is enriched in genes classified in the protein biosynthesis category. cluster  <dig> shows a peak at  <dig> dap and is enriched in genes of the nucleosome assembly and cell cycle regulation group. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> show a profile with a pronounced peak at  <dig> dap, corresponding to the transition from heart to torpedo stages. these two clusters are enriched in functional categories corresponding to proteins with binding function, lipid metabolism, transport and genes implicated in development and biogenesis. cluster  <dig> represents the transition of the early stage to middle  and middle to the late  and is characterized by a large number of genes involved in proteolysis, lipid metabolism and transport, development and protein folding.

based on the global trend from the three major clusters specifying early, middle and late stages of embryogenesis, we found that the transcriptional pattern of some functional categories could also specify embryo developmental stages. these included metabolism, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle, protein biosynthesis, defense and stress response, development and cell growth, signal transduction, transport, proteins with binding function, protein fate and energy, which are represented in early and/or the middle stage. the late embryonic stage was characterized, in addition to some goups found in the early and middle stages, by the cell fate and nutrient reserves functional categories . a comparison with the closest study published by spencer and collaborators  in arabidopsis, shows a larger representation of functional groups in our dataset. spencer and collegues found  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes in the apical and basal time course, respectively, using a p value of  <dig>  for genes whose expression was significantly different from a value of  <dig>  they then chose the  <dig> most highly expressed genes  between the developmental stages studied. in our dataset, we used different criteria, a p value of  <dig>  and cut off of ≥ ±  <dig> fold in each time point compared to the same control. our go groups were assigned to all the genes that were specific and differentially expressed in the early , middle  and late  stages of embryogenesis. while in the arabidopsis published data  <cit> , the transition from globular to heart stage is characterized by the up regulation of genes in functional groups corresponding to energy production, metabolism, protein biosynthesis, signal transduction and transcription, in our dataset, the middle stage, which include this transition, is enriched in the same functional groups except for the protein biosynthesis category which characterized the early embryonic stage . in addition, other enriched functional categories were up-regulated in the middle stage including protein with binding function, development and cell growth, protein fate and transport. the late stage was characterized by the up-regulation of the nutrient reserve category. it was reported that the storage proteins typically accumulate only from the mid-maturation phase onwards, when cell division is completed and the basic form of the embryo has developed  <cit> . given that the plant body pattern is already established and that the seedling continues to mature, it was expected to have similar transcriptional profile from torpedo to mature embryo and have an up regulation of nutrient reserves at all these late stages, which is indeed what we observed. thus, during embryo development, some functional group characterized specific stages while other groups are shared between different embryogenesis stages. indeed, the up regulation of genes related to cell cycle and protein biosynthesis characterized the early stage; protein with binding function, protein fate, cell-cell communication and transcription specified the middle stage; and reserve proteins were more abundant in late stage. energy and transport functional groups were represented in the early and middle stages while stress and defense related genes were highly represented during all developmental stages.

protein biosynthesis, including ribosomal proteins  and components of the translation machinery, were up-regulated in the early embryonic stage but then down-regulated in the middle stage. spencer and colleagues  <cit>  found a similar trend but it appears to be delayed compared to our data as it shows a significant up-regulation of genes involved in protein synthesis between the heart stage and the torpedo stage in their apical embryo time course, and between the globular and the heart stage in their basal embryo time course. these embryo developmental stages would be included in our middle stage, where we observed a decrease in protein synthesis components when compared to our early stage. this could be representative of the transition from early embryogenesis to the maturation and protein accumulation phase typical of the later embryogenesis stages  <cit> . conversely, protein fate genes were down-regulated in the early stage but up-regulated in the middle stage. genes belonging to the cell cycle category were exclusively up-regulated in the early stage. up-regulation of the protein biosynthesis category specified the second and fourth day after pollination, afterward, these genes were either down-regulated or showed no differential expression during the later time points. this finding reflects the need to produce sufficient amounts of these essential proteins and the indispensability of protein synthesis in the actively developing seeds. conversely, genes involved in protein degradation were overrepresented later in middle and late stages. spencer et al. , found the same enrichement order, while in the basal time course, from the globular to the heart stage, they showed the up regulation of protein biosynthesis, then the protein fate group was overrepresented from the heart to the torpedo stage and the protein biosynthesis group was absent. the over-expression of these particular categories of genes illustrates the high energetic requirements of embryo tissue and suggests that other regulatory mechanisms at the post-transcriptional and posttranslational levels are important during the embryogenesis. consistent with this, other interesting genes were found including genes coding for ubiquitin, and proteinase inibitors. indeed, transcriptional and post-transcriptional control have been described for the proteinase inhibitors of soybean  <cit>  and other legume seed proteins  <cit> ; and ubiquitination was already found to be an important post-translational regulatory process of the unfertilized egg cell in wheat  <cit> .

examination of the cell cycle and dna processing categories revealed a prevalence of gene up-regulation from  <dig> to  <dig> dap. b-type cyclin-dependant kinases  involved in the control of the g2/m progression in plants  <cit>  as well as a large number of s-phase markers such as histone  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  involved in dna replication and modification  <cit>  were significantly enriched and up-regulated. this is not unexpected since cell division in the embryo starts after fertilization and continues until the heart stage  <cit> . it has also been shown that protein synthesis and the cell cycle are associated at two levels  <cit> . on the one hand, protein synthesis is required for entry and progression through the cell cycle; on the other hand, protein biosynthesis is itself modified during cell division steps. this finding is in line with our data set. in the early stage, the up-regulation of rps, translation and elongation factors coincide with the overexpression of histones. markedly, in the middle stage, proteolysis genes represented by a large number of ubiquitin/proteasome-related genes, proteases, peptidases, and subtilases, were activated, suggesting active degradation of proteins by proteolysis, while protein biosynthesis genes remain expressed at a basal, non-modulated level. importance of ubiquitine/proteasome-related genes during embryogenesis has also been reported to strongly affect the progression of the arabidopsis embryo from the globular stage onward  <cit> . altogether, this suggests important post-translational protein regulation in cell cycle progression during embryogenesis.

the set of differentially expressed genes modulated during the early and middle phases also contained many signal transduction components and transcriptional regulators. among them were  <dig> signaling proteins and  <dig> transcriptional regulators. in the signal transduction category, one calmodulin, most similar to the arabidopsis cam <dig>  <cit> , and one calmodulin-like gene, most similar to the atcml <dig>  <cit>  were isolated. interestingly, three arabidopsis sip <dig> orthologs , also characterized in tobacco as acre <dig> - avr9/cf- <dig> rapidly elicited protein 216)  <cit>  and an ortholog of the arabidopsis cbl-interacting protein kinase  <dig>  were also isolated, suggesting an important role for protein phosphorylation and calcium signaling during sexual reproductive development. of the protein kinases modulated during embryogenesis, only one coded for a receptor-like kinase, scork <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, from the est pool that was used to make the cdna microarray, we had previously isolated  <dig> different rlks with  <dig> being predominantly expressed in ovary tissues or young developing fruits, and  <dig> being transcriptionaly induced following fertilization  <cit> . this discrepancy highlights the difference in sensitivity of the methodologies used, e.g. microarray analysis  vs. quantitative rt-pcr analysis  <cit> . a shaggy-like kinase gene similar to the arabidopsis atsk <dig>  <cit> , an ire-like agc kinase gene  <cit>  and an ortholog of the arabidopsis rab gtpase homolog b1c  <cit>  were also isolated. most of these have been previously shown to be involved in various stress responses and none had been shown to play a role in embryogenesis. considering the high number of differentially expressed genes  classified as involved in defense and/or stress response during all stages of embryogenesis, this also emphasize their potential roles in response to pollination and during reproductive development.

several genes implicated in embryonic patterning were found in the first two major stages. amongst these, protodermal factor  <dig>  and topless-related  <dig>  are up-regulated in the early and in middle stage, respectively. pdf <dig> is a predicted cell wall protein restricted to the protoderm of the embryo following tangential divisions between the  <dig> and 16-cell stages  <cit>  and specifies the first element of the radial pattern  <cit> . since the s. chacoense pdf <dig> ortholog shares the same expression pattern as the arabidopsis pdf <dig> with an expression peak at the 16-cell stage  this protein most probably exerts the same function in solanaceous species. the tpr <dig> gene is involved in maintenance of shoot fates during a. thaliana embryogenesis defining the apical pole of embryo  <cit> . transcriptional activation of this protein in our study suggests that the s. chacoense tpr <dig> ortholog is developmentally regulated during embryogenesis and might also act as a determinant of embryo polarity in solanaceous species.

many members of the mads box family are expressed at higher levels during embryogenesis  <cit> . interestingly, a protein identified as an ortholog of the a. thaliana agl11/seedstick gene was up-regulated during the middle stage. agl11/stk is required for normal development of the funiculus, an umbilical-cord-like structure that connects the developing seed to the placenta, and for dispersal of the seeds when the fruit matures  <cit> . furthermore, agl11/seedstick is also expressed during embryogenesis in ovules as determined from publicly available microarray data  with a high activity in stage  <dig> seeds . then its expression decreases during the middle stage and increases again in the late stage of seed development. rounsley et al. also showed that agl11/seedstick expression is also maintained after pollination through late seed development  <cit> . mads-box genes are known to act as homeotic selector genes determining floral organ identity and also as floral meristem identity genes  <cit> . our profiling study highlights the potential role of mads-box transcription factors during the early stages of reproductive development. several others studies showed an important differential expression of transcription factors, including mads-box, from various families during pollination, fertilization and seed development  <cit> .

biotic and abiotic stress-responsive genes
more than  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes are classified as potentially involved in defense and/or stress response during all stages. this suggests that these defense-related genes might also function in response to pollination and during embryo development, in addition to their contribution in defense against pathogens  <cit> . among activated genes in our dataset, those corresponding to proteins of the subtilase family were induced by two- to 137-fold. an ortholog of the ara <dig> subtilisin-like serine protease showed a two- to 73-fold change in s. chacoense. golldack and colleagues showed by in situ hybridization that the ara <dig> subtilisin-like serine protease was present at higher level in pistils, ovules and anthers, but also responded to stress and pathogen stimuli  <cit> . several other pathogenesis-related proteins were also up-regulated after pollination during embryo development, including proteinase inhibitors, thaumatin-like protein, pr <dig>  β- <dig> -glucanase-like protein and elicitor inducible chitinases. a strong increase in transcript levels, from 2- to 118-fold, of non-specific lipid transfer proteins  has been found during the middle and late stages. these proteins are member of a superfamily of seed protein called prolamins that, in addition to storage, plays important roles in plant defense responses  <cit> . the nsltps have been reported in a number of plants, including solanaceous plants  <cit> , and are involved in lipid transfer and in the formation of a protective covering of cutin and suberin layers over plant surfaces. proteomics analysis of embryo and endosperm from germinating tomato seeds revealed a high level of nsltps in the tomato endosperm suggesting a role in the mobilization of lipids from the endosperm to the embryo and probably in defense against infection during germination  <cit> . recently, vriezen et al  also reported  <dig> stress or defense-related genes that were expressed in tomato ovary tissues prior to fertilization with the vast majority  being down-regulated after fertilization. in our case, in  <dig> dap ovaries compared to unfertilized ovaries,  <dig> stress or defense-response genes were regulated, with  <dig> down-regulated genes. furthermore, when looking at the whole profile from  <dig> to  <dig> dap, a much more dynamic and variable profile for these genes is observed, precluding any global generalization over the whole time-course. the activation of defense-related genes during embryogenesis is probably due to the fact that the plant protects embryo development by increasing the activation of defense and stress-related genes. alternatively, some of these stress-related genes might exert other functions as for the pop <dig> gene that is also involved in pollen tube adhesion and growth  <cit>  and in oxidative stress response  <cit> , and for the hsp70- <dig> chaperone, involved in development and abiotic stress responses in arabidopsis  <cit> . altogether, this suggests an overlap between fertilization/embryogenesis and stress and defense response pathways. this was also reported by lan et al.  in rice, revealing a cross talk in genetic programs controlling pollination/fertilization and stress responses  <cit> .

identification of stage or transition specific candidate genes during embryo development
to identify stage-specific or transition-specific candidate genes we used a volcano plot analysis to identify genes that were specifically expressed at only one time point during embryogenesis with a p value ≤  <dig>  and a ≥ ±  <dig> fold cut off. as mentioned before,  <dig> time points  had a high proportion of stage-specific or stage-predominant candidates genes. at  <dig> dap, when ovules bear mostly heart-stage embryos, 26% of modulated genes were stage-specific and were enriched in up-regulated genes from the signal transduction, transport, and hormone-related genes gene ontology  categories, when compared to the go profiles of the other time points. of the genes orthologous to the arabidopsis emb genes required for normal embryo development  <cit> , six  were found to be stage-specific in the volcano analysis. emb  <dig> and emb  <dig> code for the mitochondrial targeted 60s l <dig> rp and the chloroplastic 50s l <dig> rp, respectively. arabidopsis mutant plants corresponding to these genes display embryos arrested at the globular stage . these two genes had been previsouly showed to be highly expressed during early embryo development in s. chacoense  <cit> . emb  <dig> codes for the cyp51g <dig> obtusifoliol 14-α demethelylase gene, a gene involved in lipid signaling  <cit> . in emb  <dig> plants, two-thirds of the embryos are arrested at the early transition to heart stage  <cit> . emb 2473/miro <dig> codes for a gtpase required for embryogenesis that also affects pollen mitochondria morphology  <cit> . miro <dig> mutants display embryos arrested at the zygotic to the 4-cell stage. emb  <dig> codes for a wd <dig> protein similar to the cia <dig> protein involved in iron/sulfur protein biogenesis  <cit> , that interacts with the willm's tumor suppressor protein wt <dig>  <cit> . in emb  <dig> mutants, only 3% of the analyzed plants displayed globular embryos while the remaining plants had no detectable embryos . the emb  <dig> gene codes for an chloroplastic putative integral membrane protein  <cit> . in emb  <dig> mutants, two-thirds of the embryos are arrested at the globular stage while 13% have a cotyledon terminal phenotype .

two families of auxin-regulated genes  have been identified among the transcripts that were specifically found in  <dig> dap heart-stage embryos. auxins are important signaling molecules involved in many developmental processes in plants. identification of embryo-defective mutants affected in the transport or the auxin signaling pathway indicates that auxins play various roles in coordinating the organization of the embryo by providing positional information  <cit> . during embryogenesis, it is particularly important in the specification of the apical cell after the first zygotic division  <cit> , the formation of the root meristem from the hypophysis  <cit> , and the establishment of bilateral symmetry  <cit> . apical-to-basal transport of the hormone auxin is initiated at the early globular stage and plays a key role in regulation of many aspects of embryonic pattern formation in plant  <cit> . in dicots, auxin is first found in the endosperm and only later is it detectable in the embryo itself with a special distribution starting with a maximal accumulation in the apical cell until the 32-cell-embryo stage. at later stages an inverse pattern of auxin maxima is observed  <cit> . amongst the auxin-regulated genes found in our transcriptomic analysis, we noticed the up-regulation of the gh <dig> gene, ydk <dig> . takase et al , found a dwarf mutant, named ya do kari 1-d , which had a t-dna insertion proximal this gh <dig> gene. the ydk1-d mutant is dominant and has a short hypocotyl, a short primary root, reduced lateral root number, and reduced apical dominance, suggesting that ydk <dig> may function as a negative component in auxin signaling by regulating auxin activity  <cit> . a second gene of interest is iaa <dig>  a member of the auxin response factors family which is required for the axialization of the embryo  <cit> . weijers et al, showed that stabilization of bdl/iaa <dig> or its sister protein iaa <dig>  prevents mp/arf5-dependent embryonic root formation. a dominant mutation that renders iaa <dig> insensitive to auxin-dependent degradation results in elimination of embryonic axis: the cell at the base of the proembryo divides abnormally and never elongates or become organized in files. the seedlings produce a short peg in place of the hypocotyl and root and also show fused cotyledons with reduced vasculature. iaa <dig> is initially expressed in the apical daughter of the zygote and in all cells of the proembryo, but it becomes restricted to the provascular cells by the midglobular stage  <cit> . although the shoot apical meristem  gradually develops during embryogenesis, it appears as a distinct histological entity somehow late during embryogenesis  <cit> , around the time where we observed peak expression of numerous auxin-related genes.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis provides the first study, to our knowledge in a solanaceous species, of the transcriptional program that takes place during the early phases of plant reproductive development, including all embryogenesis steps. we used a comparative expression profiling strategy between fertilized and unfertilized ovules to provide an insight into the embryo transcriptome in s. chacoense and to identify a subset of genes comprising this transcriptome. several potential regulators of fertilization and early seed development have been identified. we identified  <dig> genes  that were specifically regulated during these developmental stages, along with many highly stage-specific genes. although the biological function of most genes remains to be determined, the identification of genes involved in reproductive processes in solanaceous species that produces embryos much more slowly than model species like a. thaliana, will enable the selection of stage-specific genes that will deepen our understanding of complex stage transition processes as well as pinpoint potential targets for improving yield and seed quality by conventional breeding or biotechnological approaches.

differential expression of genes amongst the three major stages  of embryogenesis. using anova testing along with a benjamini and hochberg multiple testing correction algorithm,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed  in fertilized ovules compared to unfertilized ovules. only limited expression overlap was observed between these genes and the genes expressed in the other tissues tested, with the vast majority of the fertilization-regulated genes  being specifically or predominantly expressed in ovules. the hierarchical gene clustering analysis showed that, following fertilization, the ovule-expressed gene pool could be clearly divided into three major groups that specified early, middle, and late stages of embryogenesis. a venn diagram analysis of the genes predominantly expressed in fertilized ovules indicated that  <dig> genes are differentially expressed during the early developmental stage,  <dig> genes only during the middle stage, and  <dig> genes only during the late stage. sixty-six  genes are differentially expressed in early and middle stages,  <dig> genes in early and late stages and  <dig> genes in middle and late stages. sixty  genes are differentially expressed in all embryo development stages
