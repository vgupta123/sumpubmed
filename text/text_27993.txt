BACKGROUND
in the last decades, a. baumannii has gradually emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen worldwide, reflecting antimicrobial resistance, tolerance to desiccation and disinfection and biofilm formation on common abiotic surfaces in healthcare settings
 <cit> . carbapenems, primarily imipenem and meropenem, have been used to treat multidrug-resistant  a. baumannii infections
 <cit> . however, the increasing incidence of carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii  infections in taiwan and many other countries has become of critical concern
 <cit> .

currently, several mdr determinants contribute to the antimicrobial resistance observed in this microorganism. the most prevalent mdr determinants in a. baumannii include genes for efflux pumps, class b β-lactamase , class c chromosomal β-lactamase ampc, class d β-lactamase , integrons and associated insertion sequence  elements
 <cit> . virulence factors associated with resistance, including biofilm formation, and surface and extracellular polysaccharides associated with capsule formation have also been demonstrated
 <cit> . while progress has been made in characterizing the determinants of antibiotic resistance in this organism, few reports have shown the expression patterns or mechanisms underlying the acquisition or control of these genes.

to characterize the antimicrobial resistance mechanisms underlying mdr in a. baumannii, several approaches to examine gene expression profiles have been developed. proteomics methods using two-dimensional electrophoresis  and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry  have been used to examine changes in a. baumannii protein expression associated with drug resistance
. yun et al.
 <cit>  identified  <dig> proteins with expression differences in the clinical mdr strain du <dig> subjected to sub-minimum inhibitory concentration levels of tetracycline and imipenem. chopra et al.
 <cit>  compared the proteome of the mdr strain baa- <dig> and a reference strain, identifying nearly  <dig> proteins with expression differences between the two strains. indeed, the proteomics approaches using 2d and lc-ms/ms might provide large-scale proteomics involved in antibiotic resistance; however, less than 25% of proteins could be detected, reflecting the limitations of 2d approaches. also, microarray technology has been used to screen and quantify the expression profiles of antibiotic resistance genes in a. baumannii
 <cit> . however, this approach has been restricted to the study of previously known genes, which would not reveal the entire transcriptional profile of genes expressed upon exposure to antibiotics.

among the recent techniques used to analyze the whole rna profiles of microorganisms are next generation sequencing ,  <dig> gs_flx , miseq or hiseq  platforms, and abi solid . rna sequencing using the illumina system has been regarded as an extremely informative technique for the study of transcriptional profiles of microorganisms, as these techniques are sensitive and rapid
 <cit> . however, in the last two years, there have only very few studies using rna-sequencing technologies in a. baumannii
. using transcriptional profiling and functional assays in a mutant strain, cerqueira et al.
 <cit>  identified a global virulence regulator in a. baumannii that controls the phenylactic acid catabolic pathway. using the same approach, eijkelkamp et al.
 <cit>  also identified a role for the gene encoding a homolog of the histone-like nucleoid structuring  protein involved in a. baumannii virulence. currently, there is only one report concerning the whole transcriptome analysis of the genes involved in biofilm formation in a. baumannii
 <cit> . rumbo-feal et al.
 <cit>  identified  <dig> genes over-expressed in biofilms relative to stationary phase cells and  <dig> genes expressed only in biofilms. among the genes over-expressed in biofilms were those involved in quorum sensing and the csuab-a-b-c-d-e chaperone-usher secretion system. although biofilm formation has been implicated in antibiotic resistance in bacteria
 <cit> , the correlation between antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation in a. baumannii remains poorly understood.

in a previous study
 <cit> , we employed genome-wide analysis to characterize the potential resistance mechanisms in acinetobacter baumannii atcc  <dig> following imipenem exposure. genome-wide analysis showed that exposure to  <dig>  mg/l imipenem mediated the transposition of isaba <dig>  located upstream of the blaoxa- <dig> gene, resulting in the overexpression of the blaoxa- <dig> gene. thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the carbapenem resistance mechanism in a. baumannii using the illumina rna-sequencing technologies. we therefore obtained transcriptome profiles from a. baumannii atcc  <dig> and its carbapenem-selected mutants, and these profiles were compared to identify differences in the gene expression profiles. the results of the present study will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying carbapenem resistance and their association with biofilm formation in a. baumannii.

RESULTS

antibiotic-selected mutants were generated from the atcc  <dig> type strain. the identities of the selected mutants originated from atcc  <dig> were confirmed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis . the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing for these mutants and the parental strain are shown in table 
 <dig>  the reference strain  <dig> was susceptible to all antibiotics tested. the mics to meropenem and imipenem were increased more than four-fold in response to ipm-2 m and ipm-8 m selection at concentrations of  <dig>  and 2 mg/l imipenem. in addition, the mics of the imipenem-selected mutants to the other antibiotics were similar compared with the atcc  <dig> strain.table  <dig>

determination of the transcriptomes of imipenem-selected mutants and the parental strains
the total rna fractions purified from ipm-2 m, ipm-8 m and atcc <dig> strains were analyzed to determine the respective gene expression levels and identify differentially expressed genes. three libraries were constructed and subjected to paired-end sequencing using hiseq  <dig> . the reads were aligned against the chromosomes and plasmids of a. baumannii atcc  <dig>  a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> paired reads with lengths of  <dig> bases ×  <dig> were obtained for ipm-2 m, ipm-8 m, and atcc  <dig>  respectively. approximately 99% of the transcribed genes aligned in the a. baumannii atcc  <dig> genome database  were recorded.

the transcriptomic results, obtained using rna sequencing, were validated through the rt-qpcr analysis of a subset of differentially expressed genes as shown in figure

figure 
 <dig> summarizes the transcriptional responses of atcc  <dig> upon selection with  <dig>  mg/l  and 2 mg/l  imipenem. the differentially expressed genes were classified into functional groups based on cog category or kegg pathways as shown in table 
 <dig>  six groups of genes were identified: three groups were up-regulated, including recombinase, transposase and dna repair, and beta-lactamase oxa- <dig> and homologous recombination, and three groups were down-regulated, including quorum sensing, secretion systems, and the csu operon, and these gene groups were simultaneously expressed in ipm-2 m and ipm-8 m mutants. in addition, three groups of genes, including the rnd efflux pump, lipase, the multidrug efflux pump and aminobenzoate degradation, were up-regulated in ipm-2 m, and two groups of genes, including fatty acid metabolism and coa synthase, hydratase and lyase, were down-regulated only in ipm-8 m. the genes with the highest overexpression were located in recombinase and transposase and dna repair groups in ipm-2 m and ipm-8 m cells, highlighting the potential importance of these genes in carbapenem resistance in a. baumannii. moreover, a rapid increase in blaoxa- <dig>  expression from 14-fold  to 330-fold  suggests that blaoxa- <dig> might participate in carbapenem resistance. the rapid reduction gene expression upon imipenem induction was observed in the following groups: homoserine lactone synthase , 17-  to 70-fold  reduction; quorum sensing group , average 5- to 20-fold reduction; coa synthase, hydratase and lyase group ,  <dig> - to 17-fold reduction; and the csu operon , 8- to 25-fold reduction. notably, many up-regulated genes were only restricted to ipm-2 m. among  <dig> up-regulated genes, ten genes annotated as putative signal peptides were highly expressed in ipm-2 m cells, followed by a decrease in expression in ipm-8 m cells.figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study, we successfully constructed an antibiotic-induction platform to observe dynamic transcriptome changes upon carbapenem selection. a. baumannii atcc  <dig> was selected as the study material based on three advantages. first, the complete genome of this organism has been sequenced since 2007
 <cit> . second, the mics for most commonly used antibiotics, such as the 3rd cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones, are still susceptible; thus, a. baumannii atcc  <dig> would be a model candidate for antibiotic selection experiments. third, the gradual increase of mic observed only for carbapenem suggests that the carbapenem-specific resistance mechanism could be studied using an imipenem-selected platform.

in our previous study using genome-wide analysis
 <cit> , we demonstrated that imipenem exposure at a concentration of  <dig>  mg/l only mediated the transposition of isaba <dig> upstream of the blaoxa- <dig> gene. none of the other genes in imipenem-selected mutants were modified, rearranged or acquired by horizontal-gene transfer upon imipenem exposure compared to their parental strains. to continue the previous study, herein, we examined the transcriptional profiles of a. baumannii atcc  <dig> upon selection with imipenem gradient. despite all the gene expression analysis were done with strains cultured in the absence of antibiotics, the mics to imipenem in ipm-2 m and ipm-8 m remained unchangeable, indicating that these mutants were stable. besides, the mics observed in response to imipenem selection in ipm-2 m and ipm-8 m cells were  <dig> and >16 mg/l, respectively, reflecting imipenem-susceptibility and imipenem-resistance according to the clsi guidelines
 <cit> . thus, the results of the present study showed the dynamic changes in the transcriptome profiles, from imipenem-susceptible to imipenem-resistance during the selection period, representing the first study to demonstrate the potential mechanisms underlying carbapenem resistance in a. baumannii atcc  <dig> 

thus, several novel findings have been revealed in the present study. first, many of the highly expressed genes encoding proteins for recombinase, transposase, and dna repair were simultaneously observed in ipm-2 m and ipm-8 m cells. this result suggests that genome recombination might play an important role in conferring carbapenem resistance, consistent with the conclusions of several reports using genetic analysis
 <cit> . second, the overexpression of several genes involved in rnd efflux transporters and fatty acid metabolism were observed in ipm-2 m cells, and this expression was reduced in ipm-8 m cells. despite several reports emphasizing the major role of efflux pumps in the development of antimicrobial resistance in acinetobacter spp.
 <cit> , the results obtained herein are consistent with those of previous reports showing that efflux pumps, particularly rnd-type transporters, play an important role in the initial exposure to imipenem and are subsequently down-regulated during carbapenem resistance. in other words, efflux pumps alone may be not sufficient to provide protection against a high concentration of carbapenem. third, several genes involved in quorum sensing and the csuab-a-b-c-d-e chaperone-usher secretion system are down-regulated upon selection with imipenem. the disruption of these genes has been associated with a decrease in biofilm formation
 <cit> . the results of other studies concerning carbapenem resistance and biofilm formation showed reduced biofilm formation in meropenem -resistant a. baumannii isolates compared with mem-susceptible strains
 <cit> , consistent with the results obtained in either biofilm-associated gene expression or the phenotypic determination of biofilm production in a. baumannii strains. to date, the ability of a. baumannii to form biofilms that adhere to and persist on a broad range of surfaces might be key to revealing the pathogenic mechanisms of this microorganism
 <cit> . therefore, we hypothesize that carbapenem resistance might reduce virulence through the reduction of biofilm production in some a. baumannii strains.

the rapid adaption to the environment might emphasize the ability of microorganisms to live under external stress. dynamic changes in genome architecture and gene expression are required for organisms to survive in their environment. dynamic changes in the gene expression of a. baumannii have been observed in biofilm compared with planktonic cells using whole transcriptome analysis
 <cit> . also, the transcriptional responses of a. baumannii to environmental stress have been reported
 <cit> . for example, several siderophore biosynthesis genes were up-regulated in response to iron starvation and therefore are likely to be important for the survival of a. baumannii in iron-limited environments. in addition, various type iv pilus genes were also down-regulated
 <cit> . in the present study, dynamic changes in the transcriptional responses to carbapenem concentrations ranging from  <dig>  mg/l  to 2 mg/l  have also been observed. herein, we propose a "bacterial energy conversion hypothesis" to describe the dynamic changes in the transcriptome upon carbapenem stress in a. baumannii atcc  <dig>  first, the net energy required for metabolism is constant throughout the life of the cell. for rapid adaption and survival upon environmental stress, many genes in cells are monitored and up-regulated to overcome the external stress, and much energy is required for the expression of these genes. however, several genes that are not required for survival are down-regulated to save energy. in the present study, several genes, including the rnd efflux transporter, lipase, recombination-associated proteins, and blaoxa- <dig>  are up-regulated in a. baumannii upon exposure to mild carbapenem stress. several biofilm-associated genes, including quorum sensing, protein secretion system and the csuab-a-b-c-d-e chaperone-usher secretion system, which could be not required against for imipenem pressure, have been down-regulated. to adapt to a more stringent environment, the overexpression of target survival genes, e.g. blaoxa- <dig>  is needed, resulting in the consumption of most of the energy in the cell. thus, some of the genes up-regulated during mild stress, e.g. efflux pumps, are down-regulated so as to transform excess energy and maintain cell viability despite efflux pumps play important roles in the resistance to antibiotics
 <cit> . the bacterial energy conversion hypothesis requires more evidences to verify, however, in the present study, the results of transcriptomic analysis and lc-ms/ms demonstrated that blaoxa- <dig> might play a critical role in survival upon exposure to stringent carbapenem stress in a. baumannii atcc  <dig>  moreover, the transposition of isaba <dig> upstream of the blaoxa- <dig> gene is observed upon exposure to mild carbapenem stress, suggesting that the upstream signaling pathway linking external stress and isaba <dig> transposition may be a critical mechanism for carbapenem resistance in a. baumannii atcc  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
this study defined the global transcriptional response of a. baumannii to imipenem exposure. the up-regulation of recombination-associated genes and blaoxa- <dig> was the predominant feature of this transcriptional response. several genes involved in biofilm formation, such as quorum sensing, protein secretion system and the csuab-a-b-c-d-e chaperone-usher secretion system, were down-regulated upon imipenem selection, resulting in the reduction of biofilm production. overall, the results indicated that a. baumannii adapts to an environment with carbapenem availability.
