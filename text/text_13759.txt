BACKGROUND
an interesting development in the use of dopamine  agonists for treatment of parkinson's disease  is that some of them have proven to be neuroprotective in animal models of pd. antiparkinsonian agents that are direct da agonists, such as apomorphine  <cit> , bromocriptine  <cit> , and pramipexole  <cit> , are neuroprotective against 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine -induced damage to the da system in mice. administration of mptp, which is converted to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium  and intracellularly transported into daergic neurons  <cit> , provides a good model for studying neuroprotection in pd. mptp produces parkinsonism in humans and in subhuman species through selective loss of daergic neurons of the substantia nigra   <cit> , and a number of related compounds to mptp also produce nigral cell loss in primates  <cit> . mptp causes apoptosis associated with pd  <cit>  ;mptp produces progressive cell death in humans for decades after the initial insult  <cit> . hence, drugs that reduce the neurotoxicity of compounds like mptp may be neuroprotective in pd. in fact, it is now hypothesized that direct da agonists may slow the loss of daergic terminal function upon long-term administration to pd patients  <cit> .

dopaminergic neurons are tonically inhibited by dendritic and terminal autoreceptors, operating in interaction with da transporters  and pharmacologically of the d <dig> receptor subtype  <cit> . however, zapata et al  <cit>  have reported that the d <dig> preferring agonist -pd  <dig> regulates extracellular da levels via interactions with d <dig> autoreceptors. if d <dig> preferring agonists are potent autoreceptor agonists, then hypothetically long-term changes in expression of dat or the functional properties of dat might occur following subchronic treatment. since intracellular accumulation of mpp+ following systemic injection of mptp requires dat  <cit> , then when dat is downregulated by d <dig> preferring agonists, this could result in lower intracellular accumulation of mpp+ and reduced neurotoxicity to mptp.

the d <dig> receptor preferring agonists, pramipexole and ropinirole, are the most potent of the da agonists affording neuroprotection at  <dig> mg/kg for pramipexole against mptp-induced neurodegeneration  <cit>  and at  <dig> mg/kg for ropinirole against 6-ohda lesions in rats  <cit> . doses 10– <dig> times higher of da agonists with low d <dig> receptor affinity such as apomorphine  <cit>  and bromocriptine  <cit>  are needed against mptp-induced neurodegeneration. because neuroprotection by pramipexole is most evident with concurrent treatment with mptp and not with post-mptp treatment  <cit> , i.e. when autoreceptor contributions should be most pronounced, regulation of dat may be important. in addition, while the lowest effective dose reported is  <dig>  mg/kg for mice, this is significantly greater than a clinically relevant dose in humans . based on information from pharmacia corporation, equivalent plasma levels obtained with  <dig>  mg t.i.d., p.o. in humans could be produced with  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/kg in the mice. we tested whether  <dig>  mg/kg pramipexole would be neuroprotective in aging mice against mptp-induced neurodegeneration to the da system, and if this effect could be due to regulation of dat function.

RESULTS
neurohistopathology
male c57bl/ <dig> mice of 8– <dig> months of age were pretreated with saline or pramipexole  followed by mptp. at the end of the 7-day recovery period following the last injection of mptp or vehicle were assessed for the degree of toxicity to the dopamine system by mptp. mptp produced a marked loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive  neurons in the substantia nigra , but had less impact in the ventral tegmental area  , unbiased stereological quantification of the number of nissl-stained and th-ir neurons in the snpc and vta was made in the midbrains of the treated groups. mptp produced a 31% loss of th-ir neurons in the sn and 17% loss in the vta. pramipexole administered once a day for  <dig> days  did not alter the total number of th-ir neurons in the sn or vta. pramipexole administered for  <dig> days prior to and during the 2-day administration of mptp completely prevented th-ir neuron loss in the sn and vta of mptp treated mice. to confirm that th-ir neurons were dead and not simply exhibiting reduced th-ir, neurons in nissl stained sections were counted. the results confirmed the data that d3-preferring agonists can protect against mptp in vivo as well as against mpp+ in vitro  <cit> .

visualization of da fibers with dopamine transporter immunoreactivity, dat-ir , and th-ir  demonstrated uniform staining of the caudate-putamen  and nucleus accumbens  in the saline/saline cases. in saline pretreated mice, mptp reduced dat-ir by 52% in the cpu  and had a smaller but significant impact on dat-ir labeling of da fibers in the nac. dat-ir in the cpu in the pramipexole plus vehicle -treated mice was reduced by 17%. furthermore, in pramipexole and mptp treated mice, a significant attenuation of the impact of mptp in the cpu  and nac of mptp treated mice was seen.

in contrast to dat-ir, levels of th-ir  was not significantly reduced  by pramipexole in ppx-sal group. mptp produced a significant  loss of th-ir labeling of da fibers in the cpu of wt mice and to a lesser degree in the nac sal-mptp group. pramipexole did not significantly attenuate the effects of mptp on th-ir labeling of da fibers in the cpu of wt mice .

mpp+ and dopamine uptake in mouse striatal postnuclear preparations
since pramipexole treatment in non-mptp treated mice altered levels of dat-ir, it was important to identify if pramipexole treatment altered the kinetics of da and mpp+ uptake through the dat. kinetics of da uptake in mouse striata demonstrated a higher vmax but a similar km to that reported for rat fresh striatal postnuclear preparation  <cit> . uptake was sodium dependent and the km was similar due to inclusion of comt inhibitor in the preparations  <cit> . c57bl/ <dig> mice treated with pramipexole once a day for  <dig> days exhibited significant differences from saline treated mice . the vmax  and the km  for da uptake was significantly decreased in pramipexole treated mice. the vmax  and the km  for mpp+ uptake were also significantly decreased in pramipexole treated mice.

to determine if the reduction in vmax and the km for da uptake by subchronic treatment with pramipexole was due to the d <dig> receptor, the values for vmax and the km for da uptake was measured in wt  and d <dig> ko littermate mice , treated with vehicle or pramipexole for  <dig> days. anova showed that there were group differences for vmax values  and for km values . synaptosomes prepared from d <dig> ko mice had significantly lower vmax  and km , values for da uptake than wt mice . wt mice treated with pramipexole significantly lowered vmax  and km  values for da uptake compared with wt mice treated with saline. d <dig> ko mice treated with pramipexole had significantly lower vmax  and km  values for da uptake than wt mice treated with saline, but d <dig> ko mice treated with pramipexole were not different from d <dig> ko mice treated with vehicle. wt mice treated with pramipexole were also not different from d <dig> ko mice treated with pramipexole.

dopamine transporter  autoradiography
to determine if the reduction in vmax and the km for da uptake by subchronic treatment with pramipexole at  <dig> h post-treatment was due to the d <dig> receptor regulation of the number of dat sites, the density of dat sites was measured in wt and d <dig> ko mice treated with vehicle or pramipexole for  <dig> days. anova showed that there were no group differences  at  <dig> h post-treatment, but by  <dig> days there was a significant reduction of dat sites in wt mice treated with pramipexole , but not in d <dig> ko mice . wt mice treated with pramipexole exhibited a 27% reduction in the cpu, a 31% reduction of rti binding to dat in the nac, and a 11% reduction in the nas compared to wt mice treated with vehicle.

discussion
antiparkinsonian agents that are direct da agonists  are almost completely neuroprotective against mptp-induced loss of striatal da in mice. mptp administration to mice can produce varying degrees of effect on permanent damage to the nigrostriatal da system depending on the schedule of mptp administration and survival period after mptp  <cit> . in addition, under some conditions dramatic recovery from the initial loss of striatal da levels can occur without any intervention  <cit> . therefore, studies employing measures of striatal da levels as the sole criteria for impact of mptp and protection by da agonists do not offer convincing evidence of protection  <cit> . three studies have employed both unbiased stereological counts of th-ir neurons in the midbrain along with estimate of striatal da content of animals administered mptp  <cit>  or intracerebroventricular 6-hydroxoydopamine  <cit>  to produce permanent damage to the da system with protection by pramipexole. in all  <dig> studies the impact of mptp on striatal da levels was reduced by 50% with pretreatment or concurrent plus post-mptp treatment with pramipexole . protection against midbrain th-ir neurons was greater, even at  <dig> to  <dig> days post mptp/6-ohda treatment than against da levels. in this study of a much lower dose of pramipexole  given  <dig> days prior to and during the 2-day mptp treatment, at 1-week post-mptp pramipexole treatment completely spared the substantial mptp-induced loss of th-ir neurons from the snpc, but was less effective against the loss of da fibers in the cpu . measurements of striatal da  <cit>  which show more protection by pramipexole than our estimates of da fibers in the cpu  may reflect upregulation of da synthesis in the remaining fibers rather than protection against fiber loss. in addition, pramipexole treatment by itself reduced dat-ir of da fibers, suggesting that protection against mptp might be greater than our immunocytochemical measures indicate.

the interesting observation that pramipexole down-regulated dat-ir in saline treated mice suggests that dat regulation plays a role in neuroprotective effects of pramipexole. d <dig> receptors are most concentrated in the brain on neurons in the nucleus accumbens, however daergic neurons do express both d <dig> and d <dig> receptors  <cit> , and both d <dig> and d <dig> receptors are functional autoreceptors  <cit> . dopaminergic neurons are tonically inhibited by dendritic and terminal autoreceptors operating in interaction with da transporters and pharmacologically of the d <dig> receptor type  <cit> . zapata et al  <cit>  have reported that the d <dig> preferring agonist -pd  <dig> does interact with d <dig> autoreceptors to regulate extracellular da levels. those data are consistent with acute treatment with d2/d <dig> agonists leading to increased vmax  <cit> , but less is known about subchronic treatment.

we observed that subchronic treatment with pramipexole reduced the vmax, and km, of da and mpp+ uptake in mice at  <dig> h post-treatment. interestingly, d <dig> receptor ko mice exhibited substantially lower vmax and km values of da uptake than wt mice, and pramipexole did not further reduce vmax and km values in d <dig> receptor ko mice. however, the actual density of sites on the da terminals was not reduced  <dig> h after pramipexole treatment in wt mice , as determined by dat autoradiography. the inability to modulate the number of dat binding sites  <dig> h after termination of subchronic treatment with d2/d <dig> receptor agonists has previously been reported  <cit> , suggesting that the initial alteration of vmax and km with pramipexole might be due to modification of the kinetics of dat. however, pramipexole treatment reduced dat-ir of da fibers  <dig> days post-treatment, suggesting a reduction in dat sites. consistent with this, there was a reduction of rti binding to dat sites in pramipexole treated wt mice  <dig> days after pramipexole treatment, but not in d <dig> receptor ko mice. thus, there might be both rapid and slower modifications in dat function produced by d3/d <dig> agonist treatment, ultimately resulting in lower dat number, and mediated by the d <dig> receptor.

it is known that dat half-life in the striatum is decreased by d2/d <dig> receptor agonists, and increased by the dopamine d2/d <dig> receptor antagonist, but not by d <dig> agonists and antagonists  <cit> . furthermore, the d <dig> agonist-induced change in dat kinetics iss inhibited by the co-administration of an antagonist. the absence of da receptors can also influence dat function, as shown by dopamine d <dig> receptor-deficient mice, which exhibit decreased striatal da uptake  <cit> . the present results can be compared with those reported by saunders et al.  <cit>  using hdat-flag expressed in human embryonic kidney 293-em <dig> cells, who showed by confocal microscopy and whole-cell current recordings that  <dig> μm d-amphetamine increased internalization of surface dat within  <dig> h. treatment with da in hek-hdat cells also reduced vmax, due to a diminished presence of dat at the surface of synaptosomes  <cit> . subchronic pramipexole might lead to redistribution dat from the plasma membrane to endosomal compartments, and regulated, in part, by the d <dig> receptor. the initial change in vmax, and km, could be related to a more rapid turnover of dat, and the longer-term reduction in bmax to greater internalization and/or reduced synthesis. thus, d <dig> preferring agonists might be potent autoreceptor agonists, and long-term changes in expression of the dat or the functional properties of dat could occur following subchronic treatment. this, in turn, could lead to reduced mpp+  uptake into da neurons, and reduced toxicity in animal models of pd. ramirez and associates  <cit>  reported that the neuroprotective effects of pramipexole against mptp-induced da loss in mice was attenuated by the selective d <dig> antagonist a- <dig>  furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of a low dose of pramipexole was attenuated in d <dig> transgenic knockout mice and protection by pramipexole was not further attenuated by treatment with a d <dig> antagonist. these in vivo data support an important role for the d <dig> receptor in the neuroprotective effects of da agonists, and our data suggest that this, in part, is due to reduced mpp+ uptake into da neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified that subchronic treatment with a clinically relevant dose of pramipexole beginning before initiation of mptp treatment affords neuroprotection against da neuron loss and, to a lesser extent, da fiber loss. this might involve down-regulation of dat and reduced mpp+ uptake into da fibers. since intracellular accumulation of mpp+ following systemic injection of mptp requires dat  <cit> , then if dat function and/or number are reduced by d <dig> preferring agonists this could result in lower intracellular accumulation of mpp+ and reduced neurotoxicity to mptp. the importance of knowing the targets of pramipexole, and other d <dig> preferring agonists, in neuroprotection in animal models of pd cannot be understated, given the possibility that this protection could be extended to humans  <cit> . however, in vivo imaging of dat as a tool for analyzing the neuroprotective effects of da agonists could be difficult to interpret, since dat might be regulated by da agonists  <cit> . our data are consistent with this hypothesis and suggest that multiple measures of da fiber integrity are required to assess neuroprotection by agents  <cit> .
