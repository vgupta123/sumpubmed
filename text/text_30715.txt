BACKGROUND
severe respiratory and systemic disease caused by human infection with avian h5n <dig> influenza virus is characterized by high viral load and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, which if left untreated, often results in death  <cit> . epidemiological studies of outbreaks of the highly pathogenic h5n <dig> virus in asia suggest that human genetic polymorphisms influence disease severity  <cit> . more recently a single nucleotide difference in the antiviral ifitm <dig> gene was associated with hospitalization and more severe disease after the pandemic h1n <dig> influenza infection  <cit> .

pathogenesis after influenza virus infection is the result of a complex interaction between the virus, immunity, and environment . the early events after infection are critically important for the progression and outcome of the disease  <cit> . lack of virus neutralizing antibodies or genetic variation in the virus  <cit>  or the host  <cit>  can increase early virus replication and over-stimulate the innate immune response creating a pathogenic host response. the inflammatory environment associated with a pathogenic response can blunt the adaptive immune response  <cit>  and promote virus replication through recruitment of susceptible cells  <cit> . identifying the viral and host genetic determinants that contribute to alterations in early replication and ensuing host response is important for the control of pathogenesis and the identification of targets for the design of novel therapeutics. forward genetic studies in mice have identified several genetic factors that contribute to survival after infection , but few have studied the very early host response after infection  <cit> .

infections with h5n <dig> and h7n <dig> are highly pathogenic and cause severe morbidity and mortality. to identify host genes and gene polymorphisms critical for the differences during the early stages of h5n <dig> disease we have performed a qtl analysis on genetically diverse strains of mice looking at the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines ccl <dig>  tnf-α, and ifn-α,  <dig> hours post infection. we identified a single genetic locus on chromosome  <dig> containing several polymorphisms associated with an acute increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the identification of this locus and several intriguing candidate genes suggests that the host cytokines response early after infection is due to a limited number of genetic polymorphism.

RESULTS
differences in pro-inflammatory cytokine production among mouse strains
genetically diverse mice vary greatly in response to influenza virus infection and we think this is the result of higher virus replication in the first 24– <dig> h after inoculation. the increase in viral titers in the lungs of susceptible strains, such as d <dig>  leads to the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to resistant strains, such as b <dig>  <cit> . to understand the genetic and molecular basis for this difference in host response and early viral load, we quantified inflammatory host response  <dig> hours after inoculation with  <dig> eid <dig> of an h5n <dig> virus . this time point coincided with peak viral replication  <cit>  and the earliest point at which we can reliably measure the production of ifn-α . to quantify the inflammatory response after hk <dig> infection we measured titers of ccl <dig>  tnfα and ifn-α in whole lung homogenates. compared to mock-infected animals the concentration of ccl <dig>  tnfα, and ifn-α increased significantly  in both parental strains after inoculation. more importantly, levels of ccl <dig>  tnfα, and ifn-α were significantly higher in d <dig> compared to b <dig> , confirming our previous studies suggesting that early cytokine levels correlate with virus titer.to evaluate this further we quantified the lung virus titer as well as the ccl <dig>  tnfα, and ifn-α concentration in  <dig> different bxd ri mouse strains   <dig> hours post inoculation. correlation analysis revealed a highly significant association between lung virus titer and tnf-α , ccl <dig> , and ifn-α concentration  at  <dig> hours post inoculation.figure  <dig>

identification of candidate genomic loci associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines
the concentrations of tnfα, ccl <dig> and ifn-α in the lungs of hk <dig> infected bxd ri mice ranged from 11- <dig> pg/ml, 728- <dig> pg/ml, and 127- <dig> pg/ml respectively . interestingly, several bxd strains produced equally low amounts of ccl <dig>  tnfα, and ifn-α as the parent b <dig>  in contrast, none of the bxd strains produced similarly high levels of cytokines as the d <dig> parent, suggesting that the high cytokine-producing phenotype of d <dig> had reached a maximum asymptote dependent on the cumulative effects of several sequence variants. regression analysis identified a highly significant correlation between ccl <dig> and tnfα , ccl <dig> and ifn-α , and tnfα and ifn-α  concentrations in lung homogenates, suggesting a common mechanisms modulating levels of cytokine production among bxd strains.figure  <dig>

qtl analysis on cytokine profiles identified a highly significant locus located on chromosome  <dig> between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb . this locus, qivr <dig> , is associated significantly  with the amount of tnfα  and ifn-α  produced  <dig> hours after intranasal infection with hk <dig>  qivr <dig>  also accounts for variation in the concentration of ccl <dig> in lung homogenates, albeit at a lower level of significance . in general, qivr <dig>  accounted for ~18% of the phenotypic difference in cytokine levels among bxd strains and the d <dig> allele increased the trait value. winsorization of the data confirmed the genetic association for qivr <dig> . in addition to the highly significant locus on the proximal part of chromosome  <dig>  we also identified a suggestive locus  for tnfα and ccl <dig> on the distal portion of chromosome  <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig> mb . another suggestive locus was identified for ifn-α and ccl <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb . finally, tnfα concentrations associated significantly with a locus on chromosome  <dig>  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb .figure  <dig>

identification of candidate genes in qivr <dig> 
to identify the genetic polymorphisms and host genes that are responsible for the difference in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines after hk <dig> virus infection, we queried available sequence information for genetic polymorphisms between 3– <dig> mb on chromosome  <dig>  three genes—samd9l, slc25a <dig>  and ica1—contain non-synonymous snps, and one gene—col28a1—has a large in-frame deletion spanning three coding exons  the d <dig> genotype . all four genes are expressed in hk213-infected lung tissue of d <dig> and b <dig> strains and we confirmed these mutations by sequence analysis of pcr products using gene-specific primers and rna extracted from hk213-infected lung tissue from d <dig> and b <dig> . in addition to these candidate genes, we also performed sanger sequencing on pon <dig>  pon <dig>  pon <dig>  hepacam <dig>  cdcc <dig>  asb <dig>  and c1galt <dig> because of their potential to affect cytokine production or alter influenza virus infection. the reported single nucleotide polymorphisms in samd9l  and rs <dig> ), slc25a <dig>  and rs <dig> ), and ica <dig>  and rs <dig> ) were confirmed by sequencing. similarly, we also confirmed the in-frame  <dig> amino-acid deletion in col28a <dig> in the d <dig> genotype. no additional missense or nonsense polymorphisms or deletions and insertions were identified between d <dig> and b <dig> in the coding region of any of the other seven host genes that were targeted for sequencing.table  <dig>

next, we evaluated the missense polymorphisms across several other inbred strains of mice that were previously characterized for their response to influenza virus   <cit> . the missense mutations in samd9l and slc25a <dig> were unique to b <dig> and d <dig> strains respectively. in contrast the genetic differences in ica <dig> segregated well between resistant and susceptible mouse strains. the exception was sm/j whose genome harbored the susceptible missense mutations in ica <dig>  the presence of the  <dig> amino-acid deletion in col28a <dig> was also present in the a/j strain of mice, but not in the susceptible 129/svimj or the resistant mouse strains.

rna expression analysis of candidate genes in qivr <dig> 
using previously published rna expression data  <cit>  from lungs obtained from d <dig> and b <dig> mice infected with h5n <dig> influenza virus, we identified  <dig> host genes within qivr <dig>  that were detected by microarray in the context of uninfected or h5n <dig> iav infected lung tissue. these included the three polymorphic host genes samd9l, ica <dig> and slc25a <dig>  but not col28a <dig>  a comparison of baseline rna expression identified  <dig> host genes whose expression levels were significantly different , albeit the difference was less than 2-fold. these included ica <dig>  col1a <dig>  calcr, tfpi <dig> and bet <dig>  one probe , detecting a transcript located within an intron of ica <dig>  was detected only in b <dig> animals. within the locus we also identified host genes whose expression increased  or decreased  2-fold   <dig> hours after infection with h5n <dig> iav in d <dig>  b <dig> or both mouse strains. importantly we did not identify a transcript that was differentially expressed only in d <dig> or b <dig> mice suggesting that there are no sequence polymorphisms in important transcription factor binding sites.

finally, we evaluated available lung micro array data from the qtl gene-network website, correlating tnf-α cytokine levels  <dig> hours after h5n <dig> iav infection with basal gene expression in  <dig> bxd mouse strains  <cit> . interestingly, ica <dig>  samd9l, tfpi <dig> and calcr correlated well  with tnf-α cytokine concentration in these mice.

role of slc25a <dig> on cytokine production and pathogenesis after h5n <dig> infection
citrin  is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family of proteins and catalyzes the calcium-dependent exchange of cytoplasmic glutamate with mitochondrial aspartate across the mitochondrial inner membrane . mutations in this gene result in adult-onset type ii citrullinemia  and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency  that lead to distinct and overlapping effects on hepatic function through its role in urea cycle function  <cit> . because citrin was previously reported to interact with the pa polymerase protein of influenza a virus  <cit>  and a gene-knockout mouse was available we decided to test the hypothesis that slc25a <dig> controls the level of cytokine production. therefore we predicted that the absence of this gene would increase cytokine production upon hk <dig> infection. to control for the appropriate genetic background we used balb/cancrl as controls for the slc25a13-/- knockout mice congenic on the balb/cann background. compared to hk <dig> infected control animals, the slc25a13-/- animals produced equal amounts of ccl <dig>  suggesting that the lack of slc25a <dig> expression did not affect h5n <dig> induced inflammation . with respect to disease severity, we monitored weight loss and mortality over a  <dig> day period after inoculation with  <dig> or  <dig> eid <dig> of hk <dig> virus. no effect of slc25a <dig> gene expression on morbidity  or mortality  was observed.figure  <dig>

potential role for samd9l, ica <dig> and col28a <dig> in influenza virus infection and pathogenesis
here we have identified a highly significant and novel locus on the extreme proximal portion of chromosome  <dig>  that harbors three candidate genes associated with increased inflammation early after h5n <dig> iav infection. samd9l is a sam domain containing protein with similarities to samd <dig> which has been shown to be important during virus infection and innate immunity  <cit> . samd9l is expressed in many different tissues including lung  <cit>  and is upregulated by type i interferon. knockdown of samd9l expression increases west-nile virus replication  <cit> , although the mechanism is unknown. samd9l knockout mice are characterized by a delay in homotypic endosome fusion resulting in persistence of ligand-bound cytokine receptors  <cit> . iav enters cells via the endosomes requiring low ph to trigger membrane fusion and deposition of its genomic material into the cytoplasm. if samd9l is important for the trafficking, maturation and acidification of the endosome, it may act as an antiviral host gene against iav infection. interferon induced transmembrane protein  <dig>  is a host protein with potent antiviral activity. ifitm <dig> blocks entry of many difference viruses, including influenza, at the stage of membrane fusion in the endosome. deletion of ifitm <dig> in c57bl/ <dig> mice resulted in increased virus load in the lungs and increased morbidity and mortality after influenza virus infection  <cit> . while there are no non-synonymous polymorphisms in the ifitm <dig> protein between the d <dig> and b <dig> mice, the increase in viral load and associated disease in ifitm3-/- mice is similar to the phenotype observed in d <dig> mice. an alternative hypothesis is that samd9l affects the persistence of ligand-bound cytokine receptors which may increase cytokine signaling and inflammation which in turn results in more recruitment of inflammatory cells and virus infection  <cit> . although two non-synonymous amino-acid changes at position  <dig> and  <dig> in the bxd family are predicted to have minimal effect on protein activity , the reported antiviral activity of samd9l against another rna virus  <cit>  and its effect on endosome function make samd9l our priority candidate gene.

ica <dig> is another candidate gene. this islet cell auto antigen that is the target of auto antibodies in type i diabetes and sjögren’s syndrome  <cit> . ica <dig> was also identified in a gwas looking at genetic modifiers of glaucoma  <cit> . ica <dig> together with pick <dig> localizes to the trans-golgi network  and is involved in the regulation of secretory vesicle trafficking  <cit> . ica <dig> is highly expressed in nervous, glandular and muscle tissue and to a lesser extend in other tissues such as the respiratory tract. differences in ica <dig> protein structure or expression can affect the sympathetic nervous system activity and neuropeptide secretion altering the host response to infection . changes in vesicle trafficking may also alter mucus or antibody production reducing innate immune defenses to the virus and allowing for enhanced replication and increased cytokine production. ica <dig> could potentially affect the virus-encoded matrix  <dig>  ion channel activity in the tgn to neutralize the acidic ph of the tgn in order to prevent activation of ha to its fusogenic form. this activity activates nlrp <dig> resulting in the formation of the inflammasome, cleavage of pro-il-1β  <cit>  and increased inflammation. finally, ica <dig> may alter the replication kinetics of iav by changing intra-cellular trafficking of tgn-associated vesicles required for trafficking of the viral glycoproteins ha and na to the surface of the cells. interestingly the amino acid residue at position  <dig> in the c57bl/6j strain was predicted to be damaging , suggesting that the ica <dig> allele in dba/2j mice may enhance virus replication.

finally, col28a <dig> is a von willebrand factor a domain-containing protein with many imperfections in the collagenous domain  <cit> . the  <dig> amino acid deletion spans one of the many collagen triple helix repeat domains of the protein and it is not clear how this affects protein activity. interestingly, col28a <dig> contains a serine protease inhibitor domain, which could be important in reducing inflammation or virus infection  <cit> . a polymorphism in col28a <dig> was associated with the cytokine response to smallpox vaccination  <cit> .

discussion
morbidity and mortality after influenza virus infection is affected by genetic variation of important host genes. identification of the polymorphism and affected host genes will provide significant insight into the pathogenesis after influenza virus infection. in order to identify host genes with important effects on influenza pathogenesis, we performed a quantitative trait locus analysis on genetically diverse mouse strains comparing the early inflammatory response after h5n <dig> virus infection. this analysis identified a highly significant h5n <dig> control locus  on the extreme proximal part of mouse chr.  <dig> that is homologous to a  <dig> megabase interval on human chr. 7p <dig> and 7q <dig> respectively.

severe disease after influenza virus infection is mediated by both host and viral factors and many studies suggest that viral load and rapid replication are the determining factor for the outcome of the disease. these findings are supported by potent effects of neutralizing antibodies at early time points and the relatively short period of time  in which treatment with antiviral therapeutics is considered most effective. in contrast to these studies, several others suggest that inflammation is independent of viral load and caused by underlying illnesses, or differences in viral protein function, essentially changing the host response to infection from protective  to pathogenic . interferon antagonist functions of ns <dig> or the endonuclease function of pa-x are important examples of this process  <cit> . this view is supported by studies using immune-modulatory agents, like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist, lipid mediators or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonists that reduce inflammation without changing the viral load . more recently it was reported that inflammation itself is promoting virus replication by recruiting cells to the site of infection allowing the virus to grow to higher titers  <cit> . while many of these findings are not mutually exclusive, our model using different inbred mouse strains favor the explanation that elevated virus replication and infection are inducing the increase in inflammatory response and subsequent excessive mortality in the susceptible mouse strains. we now provide additional evidence that inflammation and virus titers correlate significantly  across a subset of bxd ri lines with correlation coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

a major advantage of using inflammatory cytokines as a biomarker for viral load is availability of commercially available and validated assays and the increased dynamic range between the different mouse strains. although we observed a 50-fold difference in viral titers between d <dig> and b <dig> parental strains, on a logarithmic scale this difference is much smaller . in contrast, the cytokine data is presented on a linear scale greatly increasing our dynamic range between the b <dig> and d <dig> animals while maintaining large fold differences in cytokine concentrations between d <dig> and b <dig>  thus a qtl analysis with cytokine concentration as the phenotype is more sensitive and likely to yield loci containing genetic polymorphisms involved in virus replication or antiviral activity. although we provide evidence that inflammatory cytokine concentration in lung homogenates can be used as a surrogate biomarker for viral load between different mouse strains, extensive validation in nasal washes or serum from human patients infected naturally or experimentally with influenza virus needs to be done before this can be used in clinical specimens.

several loci and polymorphisms have been associated with resistance to influenza virus disease using a variety of different genetic mouse models. bxd ri strains were used to identify genetic loci  on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the collaborative cross, which includes b <dig> but not the d <dig> mouse strain, was used to identify four different “host response to influenza” virus loci  located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . finally, bxa/axb strains were used to map loci on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> associated with more severe influenza virus infection  <cit> . the loci reported in this study have not been identified previously despite the repeated use of bxd strains. differences in phenotype, from very early  to late , and choice of mouse and virus strains will identify different genetic polymorphisms. the current study identified several other loci associated with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines after h5n <dig> influenza virus infection. the locus on chromosome  <dig> , associated with increased levels of tnfα, contains a well-known host antiviral gene ribonuclease l . the presence of at least sixteen different missense mutations between b <dig> and d <dig>  make this gene a likely candidate. qivr <dig> contains four host genes harboring non-synonymous polymorphisms including erbb2ip, a regulator of nod2-dependent nf-kappab signaling, and a member of the nuclear importin family . finally qivr <dig>  contains several polymorphic host genes including mxd <dig> and anxa <dig> 

to identify candidate genes we focused primarily on sequence variation that affects the protein . however sequence variation in regulatory regions of the gene, such as transcription factor binding sites or micro-rna target sites, can change the level of protein expression and as such impact virus infection and inflammation. at least for qivr <dig> , we did not observe large differences  in baseline expression of host genes nor did we identify lack of induction of host genes in the susceptible d <dig> strain. therefore we consider it unlikely that sequence variation in regulatory or non-coding regions of the genes present in this locus is causing the difference in phenotype.

slc25a <dig> was one of four candidate genes within the qivr <dig>  locus associated with increased cytokine production following h5n <dig> iav infection. however, mice lacking this gene did not demonstrate a change in cytokine production, suggesting that slc25a <dig> is not the host gene whose polymorphism affected the early innate immune response. previously, slc25a <dig> was found to associate with the pa gene of a related highly pathogenic h5n <dig> influenza virus   <cit> . the absence of this interaction in the slc25a13-/- had no discernable effect on the host response or pathogenesis in vivo. alternatively the effects of slc25a <dig> gene deletion vary between mouse strains. we tested the effect of slc25a <dig> on a balb/can genetic background that is different from both parental strains used to generate the bxd family. it is feasible that the deletion of slc25a <dig> in c57bl/6j or dba/2j mice would change the cytokine profile after h5n <dig> virus infection. deletion of the slc25a <dig> gene was previously reported to have variable effects on metabolism dependent on the genetic background of the mouse strains  <cit> . alternatively, the deletion of slc25a <dig> may not mimic the effects of the genetic changes found in the d <dig> strain. the amino-acid changes may have altered gene function that is not captured in the slc25a <dig> knockout mouse strain.

in conclusion, gene polymorphisms in the genome of the infected host can have a profound impact on the course of an h5n <dig> influenza virus infection. although severe disease outcomes are often attributed to inflammation with excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines, the pathogenicity of influenza infection is rooted in increased virus titers in the lungs of the susceptible hosts.

CONCLUSIONS
severe disease after influenza virus infection is associated with excessive production of inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of innate immune cells into the infected tissue. an increase in dose or enhanced virus replication contributes to the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines. identification of host-factors that facilitate virus replication and pathogenesis is important for the discovery of host targets for the development of novel antiviral therapies.

in this report we provide further evidence that excessive production of inflammatory cytokines is due to higher virus loads. we also show that pro-inflammatory cytokine production following infection with highly pathogenic h5n <dig> influenza virus is dependent on the genetic background of the mouse strain. quantitative trait locus analysis identified a locus on chromosome  <dig> that is associated with early production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased virus replication in bxd recombinant inbred mouse strains. expression and coding sequence analysis identified samd9l and ica <dig> as strong candidate genes in this locus.
