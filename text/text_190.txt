BACKGROUND
in the early eighteenth century, linnaeus provided the first workable hierarchical classification of species, based on the clustering of organisms according to their phenotypic characteristics  <cit> . in the origin of species <cit> , darwin added phylogeny to taxonomy, while also emphasizing the arbitrary nature of biological species: “i look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals resembling each other.” the reality and utility of the species concept continues to inform the theory and practice of biology and a stable species nomenclature underpins the diagnosis and monitoring of pathogenic microorganisms  <cit> .

traditional taxonomic analyses of plants and animals rely on morphological characteristics. however, this approach cannot easily be applied to unicellular microorganisms. in the latter half of the twentieth century, it became clear that bacteria could be grouped into taxonomic clusters based on stable phenotypic characters  that could be measured reliably in the laboratory. in the 1960s and 1970s, sneath and sokal exploited improved technical and statistical methods to develop a numerical taxonomy, which revealed discrete phenotypic clustering within many bacterial genera  <cit> .

such phenotypic approaches soon faced competition from genotypic approaches, such as dna base composition   <cit>  and whole-genome dna-dna hybridization ; the latter remains the gold standard in bacterial taxonomy  <cit> . within this framework, wayne et al. <cit>  recommended that “a species generally would include strains with approximately 70% or greater dna-dna relatedness”. however, few laboratories now perform dna-dna hybridization assays as these are onerous and technically demanding when compared to the rapid and easy sequencing of small signature sequences, such as the 16s ribosomal rna gene. this shift has led to an updated species definition: “a prokaryotic species is considered to be a group of strains that are characterized by a certain degree of phenotypic consistency, showing 70% of dna–dna binding and over 97% of 16s ribosomal rna  gene-sequence identity”  <cit> .

most recently, whole-genome sequencing has delivered new taxonomic metrics—for example, average nucleotide identity , calculated from pair-wise comparisons of all sequences shared between any two strains. ani exhibits a strong correlation with ddh values  <cit> , with an ani value of ≥ 95% corresponding to the traditional 70% ddh threshold  <cit> .

despite the ready availability of genome sequence data, microbial taxonomy remains a conservative discipline. when defining a bacterial species, most modern microbial taxonomists use a polyphasic approach, whereby a bacterial species represents “a monophyletic and genomically coherent cluster of individual organisms that show a high degree of overall similarity with respect to many independent characteristics, and is diagnosable by a discriminative phenotypic property”  <cit> . although the polyphasic approach is pragmatic and widely applicable, it has drawbacks. it relies on phenotypic information, which in turn relies on growth, usually in pure culture, in the laboratory, which may not be achievable for many bacterial species  <cit> . it also relies on techniques that are time-consuming and difficult to standardize, particularly when compared to the ease of modern genome sequencing  <cit> .

we, like others, are therefore driven to consider whether, in the genomic era, bacterial taxonomy could, and should, abandon phenotypic approaches and rely exclusively on analyses of genome sequence data  <cit> . however, such an approach brings fresh conceptual and methodological challenges. several forces shape the evolution of bacterial genomes: the steady accumulation of point mutations or small insertions/deletions , potentially giving rise to a tree-like phylogeny; the influence of homologous recombination in some lineages, obscuring such diversification; and the key role of gene gain/loss, particularly the pervasive influence of horizontal gene transfer, which, if substantial, could obliterate phylogenetic signals. these forces act with different strength on different parts of the genome and on different bacterial lineages. for example, sequences from a single gene such as the 16s rrna gene have been shown to fail to capture the true genome-wide divergence between two strains  <cit> . additionally, it may be expected that the various novel sequence-based metrics would be affected differently by different evolutionary forces. this raises potential problems with the consistency of classification  and backwards compatibility . in this work, we wished to explore these issues on a well-characterized and important bacterial genus, acinetobacter.

the genus acinetobacter was first proposed by brisou and prévot in  <dig>  <cit> ; however, it was not until baumann et al. <cit>  published their comprehensive study based on nutritional and biochemical properties that this designation became more widely accepted. in  <dig> the genus was listed in bergey’s manual of systematic bacteriology with the description of a single species, a. calcoaceticus. to date, there are  <dig> species described in the genus . to fall within genus acinetobacter, isolates must be gram-negative, strictly aerobic, non-fermenting, non-fastidious, non-motile, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative and have a dna g+c content of 38-47%  <cit> . some isolates within the genus are naturally competent resulting in intra-species recombination  <cit> . environmental isolates, such as a. calcoaceticus phea- <dig> and acinetobacter oleivorans dr <dig>  have attracted interest because they are able to metabolize a diverse range of compounds  <cit> . however, most research on the genus has focused on clinical isolates, particularly from the species a. baumannii. this species has shown an astonishing ability to acquire antibiotic resistance genes and some strains are now close to being untreatable  <cit> . worryingly, the incidence of serious infections caused by other acinetobacter species is also increasing  <cit> . genotypic approaches have suggested that a. baumannii forms a complex—the a. baumannii/calcoaceticus or acb complex—with three other species a. calcoaceticus, a. nosocomialis and a. pittii. however, it remains very difficult, if not impossible, for a conventional reference laboratory to distinguish these species on phenotypic grounds alone  <cit> . techniques such as aflp and amplified 16s rrna gene restriction analysis  can be used to identify species within the acinetobacter genus and the acb complex  <cit> ; however, these techniques are too laborious to be carried out in a routine laboratory  <cit> .

given the general difficulty in defining bacterial species and the ready availability of genome sequence data, we sought to evaluate a range of novel genotypic and genome-based metrics for species delineation. in light of discussed obstacles and the on-going public health concern, we believe that genus acinetobacter provides a timely test case to evaluate the validity and robustness of these sequence-based approaches. in pursuit of this goal, we generated a diverse and informative set of thirteen new draft genome sequences, representing ten species, and we analyzed the whole-genome sequences from a total of  <dig> strains belonging to the genus.

RESULTS
general genome characteristics
the genomes of thirteen acinetobacter strains, including seven type strains, were sequenced to draft quality using  <dig> sequencing . the a. bereziniae strain was found to have the largest genome size within the genus , while the strain with the smallest genome  belonged to the species a. parvus, which is known to have a reduced metabolic repertoire compared to other acinetobacter species  <cit> . these thirteen genomes were considered alongside twenty-five other publicly available genome sequences from the genus acinetobacter .

a. ursingii dsm  <dig> genome characteristics
the species a. ursingii was first described by nemec et al. in  <dig>  <cit> . we have genome sequenced the type strain dsm  <dig>  which was isolated from a blood culture taken from an inpatient in prague, czech republic in  <dig>  <cit> . in the genome we identified  <dig> good-quality cdss ;  <dig> of these do not have homologs in any of the other  <dig> acinetobacter strains in this study. depth of coverage was generally consistent, apart from two contigs which showed  <dig>  times greater-than-average coverage. scrutiny of the larger of these two contigs  identified cdss that are predicted to encode plasmid replication and mobilization proteins. this contig also contains homologs of sul <dig> and uspa genes, which are often associated with a. baumannii resistance islands  <cit> .

a. lwoffii nctc  <dig> genome characteristics
a. lwoffii was first described by audureau in  <dig> under the name moraxella lwoffii <cit> , but was later moved to genus acinetobacter by baumann et al. <cit> . in  <dig>  bouvet and grimont emended the description of the species to designate strain nctc  <dig> the type strain  <cit> . we identified  <dig> good-quality cdss in the nctc  <dig> genome, of which  <dig> do not have homologs in any of the acinetobacter genomes examined in this study. investigation of these cdss revealed two putative prophages, ca.  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb. interestingly, many of the cdss found in these two putative prophages are also present in a recently sequenced environmental acinetobacter strain p8-3- <dig>  isolated from the intestine of a blue-spotted cornetfish caught in vietnam  <cit> .

among the remaining strain-specific cdss, we identified fourteen that are nearly identical to tra genes found in phh <dig>  a low gc content plasmid isolated from pig manure  <cit> . the tra homologs are distributed on two contigs, one of which has a gc content  lower than the genome mean .

a. parvus dsm  <dig> genome characteristics
strain dsm  <dig> is the type strain for a. parvus isolated from the ear of an outpatient from pribram, czech republic in  <dig>  <cit> . we identified  <dig> good-quality cdss in the dsm  <dig> genome,  <dig> of which do not have homologs in any of the remaining  <dig> genomes. analysis with prophinder  <cit>  identified one 39kb putative prophage containing phage-related genes homologs to putative phage-related genes found in a. baumannii and a. oleivorans dr <dig>  we identified an 8kb contig with  <dig>  times higher than average depth of coverage, which contains homologs to phage related genes.

a. bereziniae lmg  <dig> genome characteristics
strain lmg  <dig> is the type strain for a. bereziniae, a recently named species by nemec et al., which has been isolated from various human, animal and environmental sources  <cit> . we identified  <dig> good-quality cdss in the genome, with  <dig> strain-specific cdss . this is a considerably higher percentage, 24%, than in other acinetobacter strains . many of the strain-specific cdss form clusters of four or more cdss, with the largest cluster containing  <dig> consecutive cdss, of which  <dig> are strain-specific. twenty-one cdss in this cluster have no significant similarity to proteins in the non-redundant protein database.

depth of coverage analysis revealed several contigs with higher than average value. one such contig has  <dig> times greater coverage compared to the rest of the genome, which suggests it is a mobile element. it contains a cds homologous to the sul <dig> gene often found in a. baumannii resistance islands  <cit> .

a. radioresistens dsm  <dig> genome characteristics
a. radioresistens strain dsm  <dig> was isolated in  <dig> from cotton sterilized by γ-radiation and is the type strain for the species  <cit> . we identified  <dig> good-quality cdss in the genome, of which  <dig> do not have homologs in any of the remaining  <dig> genomes.

a comparison with two previously sequenced a. radioresistens, sk <dig> and sh <dig>  reveals that the three strains share  <dig> cdss ,  <dig> of which were not found in the remaining  <dig> acinetobacter genomes. among these there is a homolog of the mete gene, and two genes involved in the degradation of benzoate, an aromatic compound which is known to support the growth of a number of a. radioresistens <cit> . though the three strains are quite similar, we identified  <dig> cdss in dsm  <dig> which are absent in sk <dig> and sh <dig>  but do have homologs in other acinetobacter genomes. within this group there is a genomic island containing nine genes related to fructose metabolism and a cluster of four cdss predicted to encode for type iv pilin proteins.

phylogenetic relationships within genus acinetobacter
stackebrandt and goebel suggested that bacterial species can be delineated using 16s rrna gene sequences: according to their criteria, when two aligned sequences exhibit ≥ 97% identity, the isolates from which they originate are deemed to belong to the same species  <cit> . however, when we extracted 16s rrna gene sequences from the acinetobacter genomes in this study, we found that these criteria gave inconsistent results. for example, the 16s rrna genes from the type strains of a. baumannii and a. radioresistens exhibit 97% sequence identity, suggesting they should be in the same species. similarly, sequences from the type strains of a. calcoaceticus and a. lwoffii show  <dig> % identity, again suggesting they should be classified in the same species. recent studies by keswani and whitman  <cit>  and stackebrandt and ebers  <cit>  have suggested a revised cut-off value of ≈ 99% 16s rrna identity for species delineation. we found that even using this stricter cut-off, we were not able to find evidence for delineating the type strains of a. calcoaceticus and a. pittii , and the type strain of a. pittii from a. nosocomialis strains nctc  <dig> and ruh <dig> . furthermore, when a phylogenetic tree is constructed from 16s rrna sequence data, the monophyly of the acb complex was not preserved and the confidence values for most branches fall below 70% . similar problems with using 16s rrna gene sequences to resolve species have been reported in other genera  <cit> .


given the highly conserved nature of the 16s rrna gene sequences, we attempted to reconstruct a phylogeny based on more comprehensive gene set -- the core genome of the genus. we found  <dig> orthologous coding sequences  present in all thirty-eight strains, representing around a quarter of the average number of cdss per strain. however, concerned that naïve use of this dataset might lead to problems due to homologous recombination, we selected a subset of  <dig> single-copy cdss that showed with no signs of recombination according to three different measures . these were concatenated, aligned and used to derive a phylogenomic tree . interestingly, a tree constructed with no recombination filtering was nearly identical to the tree based on recombination-free cdss .


this core genome tree generally supports the monophyletic status of the named species within the genus, with three exceptions: a. baumannii nctc  <dig> belongs in a deep-branching lineage with the a. parvus type strain dsm  <dig>  a. nosocomialis nctc  <dig> clusters within a. baumannii and a. calcoaceticus phea- <dig> is closer to the three a. pittii strains than to the other two a. calcoaceticus strains. the first two strains have been genome-sequenced as part of this study and our results suggest they have been misclassified in the culture collection. phea- <dig> is an isolate from industrial wastewater that was genome-sequenced by xu et al. <cit> . our core genome tree and comparisons of 16s rrna gene sequences show phea- <dig> to be closer to the three a. pittii strains than to the other two a. calcoaceticus strains, suggesting it too has been misclassified. interestingly, the previously unclassified strain dr <dig> sits closest to the two a. calcoaceticus strains, while atcc  <dig> is closest to the species a. haemolyticus.

once such reclassifications are taken into account, our core genome phylogenetic tree is consistent with the currently accepted genus taxonomy and also supports the monophyly of the acb complex and of each of its four constituent species. within a. baumannii, two lineages, international clones i and ii, previously identified by comparative cell envelope protein profiling, ribotyping and aflp genomic fingerprinting  <cit>  are present as monophyletic groups in our tree. the tree obtained from the core genome is similar to a tree obtained from a recently described approach based on  <dig> ribosomal genes  <cit>  .

rapid genomic approaches to species delineation
phylogenetic approaches are processor-intensive. we therefore evaluated genetic relatedness among the  <dig> strains using three rapid distance-based oligonucleotide and gene content approaches that avoid time-consuming calculations: the previously mentioned ani, as well as k-string  <cit>  and genome fluidity  <cit>  approaches.

ani relies on the identification of alignable stretches of nucleotide sequence in genome pairs, followed by a scoring and averaging of sequence identity, ignoring any divergent regions. the topology of the dendogram based on ani analysis  is congruent with our core genome phylogenetic tree, confirming the misclassifications and new relationships already identified, while also showing the two international clones as separate lineages within a. baumannii.


the k-string composition approach  <cit>  is based on oligopeptide content analysis of predicted proteomes. the divergence dendogram for k= <dig>  generally agrees with the results from the phylogenetic tree and ani dendogram at species level. however, the major problem is that the k-string approach places a. baumannii sdf outside the acb complex, probably reflecting the considerable difference in gene repertoires between this drug-sensitive strain and all other genome-sequenced a. baumannii strains.

genome fluidity provides a measure of the dissimilarity of genomes evaluated at the gene level  <cit> . a dendogram based on genomic fluidity  significantly differs from the results obtained with other techniques: a. baumannii sdf again sits outside the acb complex, a. nosocomialis strains nctc  <dig> and ruh <dig> now sit within the a. baumannii clade and phea- <dig> sits not with the a. pittii strains but with dr <dig> and the other a. calcoaceticus strains. we also performed pair-wise comparison of the gene content of the  <dig> strains, calculating the amount of the cdss shared by each pair of strains . while strains from the same species generally share at least 80% of their cdss, we found strains from different species exhibiting similar ratios. for example, a. calcoaceticus ruh <dig> shares more than 80% of its cds repertoire with dr <dig> and various a. nosocomialis, a. baumannii, a. pittii strains; phea- <dig> and dr <dig> share  <dig> % of their cdss. based on gene content only, a. baumannii sdf is distinct from all other a. baumannii strains in our study , which explains its placement in the k-string and genomic fluidity dendograms . these results indicate a potentially significant level of horizontal gene transfer among acinetobacter species and illustrate an inability to delineate species based on gene content comparison only.

these findings suggest that ani analyses provide results that are compatible with traditional and phylogenetic classifications, whereas k-string and genome fluidity approaches appear to be too strongly influenced by the effects of horizontal gene transfer to be consistent with previously accepted approaches.

defining species in acinetobacter on the basis of whole-genome analyses
the congruence of the phylogenetic tree and ani dendogram with each other and with existing species definitions provides confidence that these techniques are fit for purpose in delineating species in the absence of phenotypic data. furthermore, as goris et al. suggest, the ani approach provides a handy numerical cut-off at 95% identity to demarcate species boundaries, which corresponds to the 70% ddh value  <cit> . when we applied this cut-off to our dataset, we were able to classify  <dig> of the strains into thirteen previously named species.

in line with the likely misclassification of strains, we observed that a. nosocomialis nctc  <dig> shares phylogenetic history and exhibits pair-wise ani values greater than 95% with all  <dig> sequenced a. baumannii strains, thus confirming it should be designated a. baumannii nctc  <dig>  similar arguments apply for a. calcoaceticus phea- <dig>  and a. sp. atcc  <dig> . however, the strain nctc  <dig> appears to be distinctive enough to represent new species. while the traditional polyphasic approach to taxonomy demands additional phenotypic characterization before these species can be named, on the basis of the analyses presented here, we propose the species name acinetobacter bruijnii sp. nov.  for strain nctc  <dig> and all future strains that are monophyletic and show ≥ 95% ani to this strain.

it is interesting to note that our results based on core genome and ani analyses differ from those based on aflp patterns  <cit> ; notably in the latter a. haemolyticus and a. junii do not cluster together nor does the cluster form a sister branch to the acb complex; also a. johnsonii does not appear on the same deep-branch as a. lwoffii. this observation suggests that although aflp is adept at species resolution, it appears to be unsuitable for phylogenetic analysis.

several recent studies report alternative genomic approaches to bacterial taxonomy and species identification. these include in silico multilocus sequence analysis , average amino acid identity  and ribosomal multilocus sequence typing , which have been used to delineate species in the genera neisseria, vibrio and mycoplasma <cit> . although mlsa can be used to infer phylogeny, this approach suffers from arbitrariness in choice of in genes which varies from one taxon to the next. our proposed approach, core-genome phylogeny, can be considered an extension of mlsa and rmlst. however, as it is based on all shared cdss in a given genus, it makes use of all potentially informative sequence sites. ani, like aai, measures pair-wise similarities between genome sequences but provides better resolution of species and sub-species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this study has been to determine, using the genus acinetobacter as a test case, whether genome sequence data alone are sufficient for the delineation and even definition of bacterial species. to this end, we explored the applicability of two broad approaches: sequence-based phylogenies for single and multiple gene and distance-based methods that include gene content comparisons  and whole-genome sequence similarities . we have found that a phylogenetic analysis of the genus acinetobacter based on 16s rrna gene sequences provides unreliable and uninformative results. by contrast, a core genome phylogenetic tree provides robust, informative results that are backwards compatible with the existing taxonomy.

among the distance metrics, we found that approaches using gene content  led to anomalous conclusions, e.g., placing the sdf strain outside of the a. baumannii cluster, presumably because they are affected by horizontal gene transfer. in contrast, the easy-to-compute ani results are congruent with the core genome phylogeny and traditional approaches. using the core genome phylogeny and ani approach, we found three misclassifications, one of which represents new species. these findings illustrate the need to genome-sequence all strains archived in culture collections, which is likely to become technically and economically feasible in the near future.

we believe a combination of core genome phylogenetic analysis and ani provides a feasible method for bacterial species delineation, in which species are defined as monophyletic groups of isolates that exhibit at least 95% pair-wise ani to each other. this approach combines a theoretically rigorous approach  with a pragmatic metric  that provides a numerical cut-off that is backwards compatible and has been shown to be applicable to a diverse group of bacteria  <cit> .

our sequence-based approach has several desirable characteristics. firstly, it is capable of resolving the inconsistency in classification of genomospecies. for example, our results confirm the recent assignment of genomospecies  <dig> and 13tu to latin binomials a. pittii and a. nosocomialis, respectively. secondly, it provides a scalable and uniform approach that works for both culturable and non-culturable species, solving the problem in classifying non-culturable organisms, in an era when whole-genome sequences of such organisms can be recovered relatively easily via metagenomics or single-cell genomics. thirdly, our approach is faster and cheaper than traditional taxonomic methods, as well as being easily replicable and transferable among research institutions. finally a method that combines phylogeny and pragmatism falls in line with darwin’s vision of classification, as stated in the conclusion of origin of species: “our classification will come to be, as far as they can be so made, genealogies…”  <cit> .
