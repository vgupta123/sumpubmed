BACKGROUND
poly-β-hydroxybutyrate  is a polymer used for the storage of carbon and energy in a large variety of prokaryotes. it is accumulated in the cytoplasm if a carbon source is provided in excess and if any other essential nutrient is limited  <cit> . phb belongs to the polyesters class of polymers, which is of interest as an industrial plastic because of its biodegradability and origin from renewable resources. microbial phb synthesis is a promising strategy for the production of bioplastics and offers a promising opportunity to transition toward a future-oriented bioeconomy  <cit> .

most species of rhizobia synthesize phb and accumulate it in intracellular granules  <cit> . in some species, phb accumulation can exceed 50% of the cell’s dry weight  <cit> . various ways that rhizobia can use phb to benefit their plant hosts have been proposed. for instance, it was proposed that phb utilization could sustain the oxygen demand of the bacteroids during darkness; thus, contributing to the preservation of nodule activity and the continuation of nitrogen fixation at high rates  <cit> . phb may also fuel the differentiation of rhizobia into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids  <cit> . in addition, rhizobia may simply degrade phb in ways that enhance their own fitness. phb may provide the energy and carbon required for bacterial reproduction, or for stress tolerance required within senescing nodules or after symbiotic rhizobia escape into the soil and transition to the free-living state.

biochemically, phb synthesis can compete with nitrogen fixation  <cit> . in addition, a negative correlation was observed between the rate of nitrogen fixation and phb accumulation  <cit> . a mutant of rhizobium etli, that did not accumulate phb, was shown to significantly fix more nitrogen than the isogenic wild type  <cit> , whereas non-fixing nifh mutants of r. etli <cit>  and bradyrhizobium japonicum <cit>  accumulated more phb than their isogenic nitrogen-fixing parental strains. there is a conflict between rhizobia and legumes over the rate of phb accumulation, due to the metabolic tradeoff between nitrogen fixation and phb accumulation. therefore, phb biosynthesis and accumulation in species of rhizobia may be controlled to balance the tradeoff, but the mechanism underlying this control has not yet been fully explained.

one of the best studied microorganisms with respect to phb biosynthesis and accumulation is the gram-negative bacterium ralstonia eutropha <cit> . it synthesizes phb using the three phb synthetic genes: phba, which encodes 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase; phbb, which encodes acetoacetyl coa reductase; and phbc, which encodes the enzyme phb synthase. phb degradation, however, is performed by phb depolymerase, which is encoded by phaz. phasins, encoded by phap, are a class of low-molecular-mass amphipathic proteins that form a layer at the surface of the phb granule and stabilize it  <cit> . the r. eutropha possesses at least four phap paralogs identified so far  <cit> . expression of the major phasin, encoded by phap <dig>  is regulated by the transcriptional repressor phar  <cit> . under conditions less favorable for phb biosynthesis, phar binds to the phap <dig> promoter region to repress transcription of this gene. after the onset of phb biosynthesis, when the nascent phb granules gradually form, phar leaves the promoter and binds to the granules so that phap <dig> is transcribed and translated. during the later stages of phb accumulation, phar is estimated to bind no longer to the granules as it is displaced by phap <dig> phasin. the displaced phar returns to bind to the phap <dig> promoter and represses transcription again  <cit> .

most members of the rhizobiaceae are known to possess single copies of the phb biosynthesis genes. for instance, strains of sinorhizobium meliloti, the symbionts of alfalfa, regarded as one of the model organisms to study symbiotic nitrogen fixation, are characterized to have a single set of the genes for phb metabolism, namely phba, phbb, phbc, and phaz <cit> , whereas two paralogous genes, phap <dig> and phap <dig>  encode functional phasins  <cit> . on the other hand, strains of b. japonicum, the symbionts of soybean, are known to accumulate a large amount of phb  <cit> , and the b. japonicum usda <dig> genome was found to contain five paralogs of phbc, as well as two paralogs of phbab <cit> . this genetic redundancy may suggest a functional importance that has not yet been fully elucidated. in this study, we examined the expression profiles of the paralogs relevant to phb metabolism in free-living b. japonicum cells under phb accumulating and non-accumulating conditions. then, we identified the phasin-encoding paralogs from the genomic information  <cit> , and used a variety of tools to investigate their involvement in phb accumulation.

RESULTS
b. japonicum candidate genes involved in metabolism and phb accumulation
the genome of b. japonicum usda <dig> possesses five paralogs of phbc, namely phbc <dig> , phbc <dig> , phbc <dig> , phbc <dig> , and phbc <dig> , as well as two paralogs of phba and phbb, phba <dig> , phba <dig> , phbb <dig> , and phbb <dig>   <cit> . we predicted that two putative phaz genes from the b. japonicum genome  <cit>  encode phb depolymerases based on their similarities to the phaz of s. meliloti   <cit> , which had previously been functionally characterized  <cit> . the results of amino acid sequence comparisons among the products of the phbc and phaz paralogs are summarized in figure  <dig>  the gene products of phbc <dig>  phbc <dig>  and phbc <dig> are remarkably similar to each other. those of phbc <dig> and phbc4are shorter but share similarities in the c-terminal regions of phbc <dig>  phbc <dig>  and phbc <dig>  the phaz paralogs were found to share weak similarities to phbc <dig>  phbc <dig>  and phbc <dig>  which may have implications in the enzyme evolution for the reversal reactions of phb polymerization and depolymerization.

within the b. japonicum usda <dig> genome, there are seven genes predicted to encode phasins because their deduced amino acid sequences could contain the phasin_ <dig> motif   <cit> . judging from conservation of the motif, we selected four out of the seven genes for this study: phap <dig> , phap <dig> , phap <dig> , and phap <dig> . the motifs predicted in the other three putative phasin paralogs were assessed as less reliable . these four paralogs are small proteins of 112– <dig> amino acid residues; an alignment of their amino acid sequences is shown in figure  <dig>  the putative phar , encoding the transcriptional repressor of phap, was deduced by its similarity to the previously identified phar of s. meliloti <cit> .

expression profile of the candidate genes in free-living cells
cells of b. japonicum usda <dig> were inoculated into three different media  and allowed to grow for eight days . cells exhibited the slowest growth in yem, which is rich in carbon sources but poor in nitrogen sources. when the optical density reached  <dig>  at 600 nm, cells were harvested, and their intracellular phb content was measured . no phb was detected in the cells grown in ty medium, whereas only a trace of phb was detected in cells grown in psy. on the other hand, a substantial amount of phb was detected in the cells grown in yem. replacing mannitol, the carbon source in yem, with an equivalent concentration of other sugars, including arabinose, mannose, glucose, and sorbitol, resulted in similar levels of phb accumulation . these results suggest that the phb accumulation does not specifically depend on mannitol, but on the richness of the carbon sources together with a relative lack of nitrogen sources available in the medium. under nutritional conditions in which carbon sources are in excess relative to nitrogen sources, the intracellular pool of substrates for phb synthesis, including acetyl coa and acetate, would be enlarged by less efficient nitrogen assimilation, which may be one of the signals triggering phb accumulation.

phb began to appear in cells cultured in yem at an optical density of  <dig>  at 600 nm . we prepared total rna samples from cells grown in each of the three media, and then subjected the samples to quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr  analysis to measure the expression levels of the genes possibly involved in phb biosynthesis and degradation. among the genes predicted to be involved in phb metabolism, we detected transcription of phba <dig>  phbb <dig>  phbc <dig>  phbc <dig>  and phaz <dig>  whereas expression of the others was negligible , indicating that only one or two of the respective paralogs functioned. moreover, the levels of transcription of the phb biosynthetic genes were higher under phb non-accumulating conditions in ty medium than accumulating conditions in yem, and thus obviously they were not induced upon phb accumulation. it was also paradoxical that phaz <dig>  which could be involved in phb degradation, seemed to be induced under phb-accumulating conditions.

the transcription profile of phap and phar involved in phb accumulation was also examined using qrt-pcr . in contrast to the phb-metabolic genes, induction of some of the phap encoding putative phasins correlated with phb accumulation. among the four phap, phap <dig> was most prominently induced under phb-accumulating conditions in yem medium reaching levels up to  <dig> times greater than that of the control, siga, which encodes the house-keeping sigma factor. these results imply that phap <dig> may play an important role in phb accumulation. when cultured in yem, phap <dig> and phap <dig> were induced to levels up to  <dig> times greater than the control, implying that phap <dig> and phap <dig> may also have roles in phb accumulation. in psy medium, both phap <dig> and phap <dig> were induced to lower levels, which may be relevant to the lower phb accumulation seen in this medium . on the other hand, expression of phar was kept at a low level and only barely enhanced upon phb accumulation, which is consistent with the self-regulation model proposed in r. eutropha <cit> . transcription of phap <dig> was almost constant and as low as that of phar, and thus this paralog might be irrelevant to phb accumulation under these conditions.

when all these results are considered, it is conceivable that phb accumulation in b. japonicum during free-living growth may not depend on either the redundancy or expression levels of the genes for phb synthesis and degradation. instead, it seems probable that the major mechanism allowing b. japonicum to accumulate large amounts of phb may be the formation of phb granules stabilized by phasins.

the four phap phasins and phar bound to phb with different affinities
phap <dig>  phap <dig>  phap <dig>  phap <dig>  and phar were cloned individually into escherichia coli and expressed as n-terminally his6-tagged fusion proteins. for unknown reason, the his6-tag fusions could not be purified by the conventional affinity chromatography. therefore, the crude extracts of e. coli cells containing the fusions were used directly in the phb binding experiment. because the n-terminus of each fusion protein contained the same single his6-tag, we assumed that each his6-tag equally reacts with the anti-his6-tag antibody, presumably regardless of fusion partner, and the signal intensities on immunoblots probed for the his6-tag were used to represent the amounts of the phasin fusions contained in the extracts.

the crude extracts containing phasin and phar fusions, adequately diluted and controlled to give almost the same signal intensities on immunoblots, were mixed with a serially diluted suspension of fine phb powder in test tubes, and incubated on ice to allow formation of phb/protein complexes. the insoluble phb/protein complexes were spun down, washed to remove out non-specific proteins, and then subjected to sds-page followed by immunoblot analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  all four phasin fusions, as well as the phar fusion, exhibited some phb binding. this suggests that their native forms may possess the proposed function of covering the surface of phb granules in vivo. phap <dig> and phar showed the highest affinities to phb, as they bound it tightly at lower concentrations, whereas the other three had lower affinities. as mentioned above, these four phap proteins contain the phasin_ <dig> motif , but only phap <dig> possesses the c-terminal region containing an amino acid sequence stretch very rich in alanine, in which  <dig> out of  <dig> residues are alanine . the alanine-rich sequence in the phap proteins of r. eutropha <cit>  was proposed to be important for exerting phasin function. this may also be the case with phap <dig> of b. japonicum.

pötter and colleagues proposed the following mechanism for phb granule development in r. eutropha <cit> . when phb is not produced, phar exerts its repressor function by binding dna and repressing transcription of phap <dig>  which encodes the major phasin. with the onset of phb accumulation, phar leaves the dna to bind to the neonate phb droplet, allowing induction of phap <dig>  then, as more phap <dig> is produced and begins to occupy the surface of the growing phb granule, phar is outcompeted and expelled from the granule and returns to dna to repress phap <dig> again. in order to determine if this proposed mechanism is also operating in b. japonicum, we compared the phb affinities of phap <dig> and phar using an in vitro competition assay. fixed amounts of phar and phb were mixed in test tubes, and various amounts of phap <dig> were added to the mixture. after incubation, the proteins contained in the insoluble phb/protein complexes were subjected to the immunoblot analysis described above. as shown in figure  <dig>  as the amount of phap <dig> increased, more phap <dig> and less phar were found in the complexes. these results indicate that phap <dig> and phar competed with each other for binding to phb, and that phap <dig> at higher concentrations could replace phar bound to phb. we have already shown, above, that phap <dig> was most prominently induced upon phb accumulation . taken together, the results obtained in this study suggest that phap <dig> may play the most important role among the four phb-binding phasins, and could possibly be regulated by phar using a mechanism similar to the one proposed in r. eutropha.

we have not experimentally assessed the actual repressor function of phar; these experiments will be performed and reported later. in addition, to confirm the importance of phap <dig> and phar, we attempted to construct knockout of these, as well as the other phap. however, for unknown reasons, repeated attempts were not successful. we have considered the construction of b. japonicum mutants overexpressing these genes to see the effects not only during free-living growth but also during symbiosis with the host plant. the results of these experiments would be reported in the near future.

CONCLUSIONS
b. japonicum usda <dig> accumulated intracellular phb during free-living culture in the presence of excess carbon sources together with restricted nitrogen sources. its genome contains redundant paralogs that could be involved in phb biosynthesis and degradation, but only one or two of each paralog family was found to be expressed during free-living growth. in addition, expression of the phb metabolic genes was not correlated with phb accumulation. thus, it is conceivable that phb accumulation during free-living growth is independent of redundancy or expression levels of phb metabolic genes. instead, it was found that some of the four phap encoding phasins were induced upon phb accumulation. all the four phasins exhibited some phb binding in vitro. phap <dig> showed the highest affinity for phb and could be responsible for the majority of phap function. furthermore, phap <dig> was able to compete for phb binding with phar, which is its plausible transcriptional repressor and possesses high affinity to phb. phap <dig> is able to expel phar and stabilize the phb granule. therefore, in free-living b. japonicum, carbon sources in excess relative to nitrogen sources enlarge the pool of substrates for phb synthesis, such as acetyl-coa and acetate. this could allow elevation in levels of intracellular phb, which is recognized by phar repressor. this recognition triggers induction of phasins, including phap <dig> and maybe some others. phasins then autonomously stabilize the accumulated phb granules. this proposed mechanism resembles the mechanism proposed in r. eutropha.
