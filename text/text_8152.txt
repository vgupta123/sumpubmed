BACKGROUND
mercury is a highly hazardous pollutant with an estimated global natural mercury emission of  <dig> - <dig>  tons per annum  <cit>  and global anthropogenic mercury emission to the atmosphere was estimated to be  <dig>  tons in  <dig>  <cit> . since mercury is ubiquitous in the environment, it is nearly impossible for most humans and animals to avoid exposure to some forms of mercury, be it elementary, organic or inorganic. mercury, through biotransformation and bioaccumulation, has found its way through the food chain to humans. anthropogenic activities and industrialization are also sources of mercury pollution that had resulted in several catastrophe of mercury poisoning in japan  <cit> , the amazon basin  <cit>  and iraq  <cit> , and recently many high-risk sites have been identified in asia  <cit> . moreover, mercury pollution and poisoning have imposed a huge economic cost on environmental remediation and public health  <cit> .

all forms of mercury cause toxic effects in a number of tissues and organs depending on the chemical form of mercury as well as the level, duration and the route of exposure  <cit> . exposure to mercury compounds typically occurs by inhalation or ingestion. ingested mercury is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and it is distributed to all tissues in about  <dig> h while inhaled through mercury vapor accumulates in red blood cells and is carried to all tissues in the body in less than  <dig> h  <cit> . mercury undergoes extensive biliary-hepatic cycling  <cit> . it is secreted into bile and partly reabsorbed into the portal circulation and thereby returned to the liver. the high mobility of mercury in the body is attributed to the formation of water-soluble mercury complexes that are mainly, if not exclusively, attached to the sulfur atom of thiol groups such as glutathione  <cit> . the glutathione moiety is degraded in the bile duct and gall bladder to a dipeptide and finally to an l-cysteine mercury complex before entering the circulatory system  <cit> . it is in the form of the l-cysteine complex that mercury enters the endothelial cells of the blood-brain and placental barriers. mercury can gradually accumulate in the central nervous system and kidney, thus causing damage to these organs. hence, there have been several molecular mechanistic studies on neurological  <cit>  and renal  <cit>  toxicities induced by mercury. however, despite of the fact that the extensive biliary-hepatic cycling of mercury  <cit>  and of some evidence suggesting that liver plays a role in renal tubular uptake of mercury  <cit> , little is known with regard to the mechanism of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity. based on the role of liver in mercury biotransforming and cycling, as well as its central roles in the control and synthesis of critical blood constituents that affect whole body physiology, we hypothesized that mercury exposure can cause liver injury that may lead to other syndromes. in view of the prevalence of mercury exposure in humans, understanding of the mechanism of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity is therefore important for elucidating its impact on liver health.

the advent of omics technologies such as genomics and transcriptomics has enabled the simultaneous assessment of expression profiles of thousands of genes that respond to a toxic compound within a particular cell type, tissue, or an organism  <cit> . the zebrafish is an increasingly popular model not only for vertebrate development  <cit>  but also for understanding human diseases  <cit>  and toxicology  <cit> . many physiological and molecular similarities in xenobiotic metabolism and adaptive response to toxicant insults have been found between zebrafish and mammals, making the zebrafish an ideal toxicology model in toxicology  <cit> . although zebrafish has become popular as an in vivo system to model human diseases and toxicities, toxicogenomic researches using zebrafish seem not to have been extensively conducted. we and others have shown that zebrafish responded biologically to chemicals, such as small molecules, drugs and environmental toxicants, in a similar manner as mammals  <cit> . the availability of zebrafish in large numbers, its small size and easy husbandry makes zebrafish a cost-effective model when compared to the rodent model for toxicological studies. in addition, the amenability of the zebrafish system to various molecular techniques and the vast genomic resources, including the near-completed zebrafish genome project and available zebrafish microarrays, make it a highly versatile system for toxicogenomic studies. moreover, fish have long been used as sentinels for biomonitoring of aquatic environmental pollutants and are good indicators of mercury pollution  <cit> .

to our knowledge, there is no research report to elucidate the in vivo hepatotoxicity mechanism induced by mercury as well as its induced syndromes. recent work by gonzalez et al had indicated that the liver of the zebrafish is one of the main organs of mercury accumulation during the first  <dig> days of exposure to methylmercury  <cit> . in this study, we aimed to investigate the in vivo mechanism of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity using the zebrafish as a model and compared it with other published data. to date, most mechanistic studies of mercury-induced toxicity in human/mammals have been performed either in vitro or in vivo using non-liver tissue. however, mechanistic insight obtained from the in vitro systems can be quite different from those obtained from the in vivo environment because of the lack of coordination of biological processes in whole organism. as the liver is the main organ that performs detoxification processes as well as regulation of metabolic pathways, it is important to understand toxicity effects and malfunctions that may implicate metabolic disorders induced by some toxicants in liver in vivo.

here, using the dna microarray technology, we captured the kinetics of hepatic transcriptome changes in zebrafish upon mercury exposure in order to generate a global transcriptome view of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity. using gene set enrichment analysis  and knowledge-based data mining, we compared our findings with those reported in human liver cell line and/or in mammalian model. we performed phenotype anchoring by linking histological analyses to the transcriptome data and subsequently performed gene expression validation using real-time pcr on a separate set of samples from seperate mercury exposure experiments. taken together, we proposed a plausible in vivo mechanistic model of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity that could lead to syndromes related to mitochondrial dysfunction, endocrine disruption and metabolic disorders.

RESULTS
characterization of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity responses in zebrafish from transcriptome analysis
preliminary acute toxicity test was first performed to determine the appropriate concentrations of mercuric chloride  for dna microarray experiments. fishes were treated with different concentrations of hgcl <dig> ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/l for  <dig> days. acute toxicity and motility test for hgcl <dig> exposure treatment revealed that  <dig> μg/l hgcl <dig> caused all the fish to die within  <dig> days, while treatment at concentrations of  <dig> μg/l produced 90% of survival rate up to  <dig> days . all surviving fish treated with  <dig> μg/l displayed normal swimming behavior without obvious adverse effect. therefore,  <dig> μg/l of hgcl <dig> was chosen for the subsequent dna microarray experiments as the concentration was sufficient to induce acute toxicity with minimal mortality.

bioaccumulation of hgcl <dig> was not determined in the present study. in a similar study recently published  <cit> ,  <dig>  mg/l hgcl <dig> was used for exposure in another tropical freshwater fish, brycon amazonicus, and  <dig>  mg hg per kg liver from treated fish was detected in fish liver at  <dig> h and thus a bioaccumulation factor of about  <dig> in the liver was estimated.

based on the transcriptome data, genes that were significantly regulated by mercury were identified at different time points  with p-value <  <dig>  and mapped to human homologous genes . compared to  <dig> h time point, the number of genes significantly deregulated  at  <dig> h increased dramatically and a further increase was observed at  <dig> h time point. the increasing numbers of differentially expressed genes may serves as a rough indication that more biological processes were deregulated with the increase of duration of mercury exposure up to  <dig> h.

gene set enrichment analyses , which employs a statistical algorithm to compare the entire ranked list of genes through transcriptome profiles with defined knowledge-based gene sets obtained from established biological knowledge , was used to determine biological pathways perturbed by hgcl <dig>  biological pathways that are statistically enriched  from whole transcriptome analyses at the four time points  of hgcl <dig> treatment using gsea are shown in table  <dig>  the activities of the enriched pathways are indicated in normalized enrichment scores  as described in the methods section. positive and negative nes values indicate up- and down-regulation of genes associated with pathways, respectively. in addition, we also explored canonical pathways that are enriched using the ingenuity pathway analysis  system http://www.ingenuity.com/. we considered early  and late  stages in this analysis and the top  <dig> enriched canonical pathways were compared with results from gsea . results from both gsea and ipa suggest that pathways associated with protein degradation, stress, acute phase responses, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell damage are enriched .

biological pathways that are statistically enriched with false discovery rate  <  <dig>  or nominal p-value  <  <dig>  are shown. values of normalized enrichment score  indicate the activities of enriched pathways with positive and negative nes shows up- and down-regulation, respectively. number of leading edge genes for each pathway is given in bracket besides the nes values.

the transcriptome analysis using gsea revealed that genes associated with electron transport chain, mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, nuclear receptor signaling and apoptotic pathway were down-regulated as early as  <dig> h of hgcl <dig> exposure. this was followed by up-regulation of genes associated with the complement system and proteasome pathway, suggesting increased activity of these processes at  <dig> h. major processes that were affected throughout the latter three time points of hgcl <dig> treatments  were proteasome pathway, electron transport chain, and mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation . interestingly, electron transport chain that was initially down-regulated at  <dig> h were subsequently up-regulated at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, implying an increased need of intracellular energy production presumably to compensate the early down-regulation and to meet the energy requirement of the adaptive response to hgcl <dig> exposure. at  <dig> h of hgcl <dig> exposure, more biological pathways were significantly affected such as up-regulation of actin pathway, fatty acid synthesis, dna damage signaling pathway, classical complement activation, intrinsic apoptotic pathway, cell motility, hypoxia-induced factor pathway, and gluconeogenesis, as well as down-regulation of cell cycle, non-substrate gsk <dig> interacting proteins, and wnt signaling pathway.

taken together, the transcriptome analysis revealed that early targets of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity involved mitochondrial processes , apoptotic pathway and nuclear receptor signaling. the following up-regulation of complement system and proteasome pathway suggest activation of acute phase response and increased degradation of damaged proteins within  <dig> h of hgcl <dig> exposure. by  <dig> h, several critical processes associated with cellular maintenance, stress, survival and metabolism were clearly deregulated in the liver. earlier work by gonzalez et al  <cit>  using the zebrafish to elucidate effects of methylmercury on gene expression in liver, skeletal muscle, and brain indicated genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, detoxification process, dna repair and apoptosis were generally deregulated. hence, there are similar observed toxicity effects between inorganic mercury and organic mercury such as methylmercury. thus, it is important to further understand the mechanism of their in vivo toxicity in future works.

comparative analysis revealed some common mercury-induced processes in both zebrafish liver and human liver cell line
in order to determine molecular conservation of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity, we compared pathways that were induced or suppressed by hgcl <dig> between zebrafish and human cell line using gsea. transcriptome data of liver cell line  exposed to  <dig> μm of hgcl <dig> for  <dig> h were obtained from the gene expression omnibus  and used for comparative study with our zebrafish transcriptome data. deregulated processes with fdr<  <dig>  or np <  <dig>  were selected. comparative gsea revealed that dna damage signaling and proteasome pathway were both up-regulated in zebrafish liver and hepg <dig> cells. likewise, nuclear receptor signaling pathway, mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and electron transport chain  were down-regulated by hgcl <dig> in both zebrafish liver and hepg <dig> cells, indicating similar mode-of-action of hgcl <dig> in these two models at certain levels .

biological pathways that are statistically enriched with false discovery rate  <  <dig>  or nominal p-value  <  <dig>  are considered. * indicate pathways that are common in zebrafish and hepg <dig> cell treated with hgcl <dig> 

however, unlike zebrafish, hepg <dig> cells showed up-regulation of cell cycle, pyrimidine metabolism and dna repair owing to the proliferative state of hepg <dig> cells . this may indicate differential toxicity responses between proliferative cell cultures and highly differentiated in vivo models. more importantly, being an in vivo model, the zebrafish liver data has an advantage to capture deregulated biological processes that involves interactions of various cell types and whole-organism physiological metabolic processes such as fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and other processes involving non-substrate gsk <dig> interacting proteins and complement activation. thus, using an in vivo model such as zebrafish may help researchers to characterize pathways that are perturbed by toxicants under in vivo environments.

hgcl <dig> affected liver cell morphology and cell adhesion
in order to further elucidate the mechanism of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity, we performed phenotypic anchoring  <cit>  by linking histological evidence to the mercury-induced transcriptome changes. this was further validated by real-time pcr for targeted genes associated with mercury-induced phenotype/pathology and transcriptome changes in the liver. in these experiments, we treated a new batch of zebrafish with different concentrations of hgcl <dig>  from environmental-relevant  to sub-lethal concentration . real-time pcr validation of targeted genes were performed on liver samples from zebrafish treated with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg/l for  <dig> h while phenotype anchoring were performed using liver from zebrafish treated with  <dig> and/or  <dig> μg/l for  <dig> h.

qualitative histological examinations for samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin  had revealed that hepatic parenchyma cells appeared to be less homogeneous in hgcl2-treated fish than in control fish . at a high magnification, it was observed that the liver parenchyma from hgcl2-treated fish appeared to be loose in cell contact and the cells were dissociated and irregular in shape  while control fish liver is filled with well-delineated polygonal cells .

immunohistochemical staining of e-cadherin, a transmembrane cell adhesion protein, was weaker and less distinct between the liver cells in hgcl2-treated fish than control fish, suggesting that membrane integrity and cell adhesion were affected . likewise, immuno-staining of keratin- <dig> revealed a weaker staining of the cytoskeletal protein in liver cells of mercury-treated fish than those of control fish , suggesting altered cytoskeletal organization and assembly which can affect cell morphology and motility. thus, the histological phenotypes such as changes in cell morphology, cell adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins observed in the liver of hgcl2-treated zebrafish corroborated with the deregulated biological processes such as the actin pathway, wnt signaling pathway and cell motility as identified in the transcriptome analysis.

hgcl <dig> decreased hepatocyte cell number via induction of apoptosis
quantitative counting of nucleated hepatic cell counts based on h&e stained sections revealed that hgcl <dig> decreased the number of hepatic parenchyma cells significantly in a concentration-dependent manner . the number of hepatic parenchyma cell decreased approximately 20% and 50% in livers of fish treated with  <dig> and  <dig> μg/l hgcl <dig>  respectively, when compared to livers of control fish. immunohistochemical-staining of dna breakage induced by apoptosis detected higher incidence of apoptotic dna fragments in livers of hgcl2-treated fish than control fish . transcriptome analysis supported this observation, as indicated by the fact that intrinsic apoptotic pathway was induced at  <dig> h by hgcl <dig> . in addition, it has been shown that hgcl <dig> induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells via a mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic apoptotic pathway  <cit> . therefore, our findings implicate that the decrease in liver cells is caused by induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

hgcl <dig> induced fatty liver condition
by oil red o staining, dosage-dependent lipid accumulation, as indicated by the increased number and size of red-stained lipid vesicles, was detected in the liver of hgcl2-treated fish . the histological phenotype was thus consistent with the transcriptome analysis where up-regulation of fatty acid synthesis and down-regulation of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation were found in the liver of hgcl2-treated zebrafish . accumulation of lipids can lead to adipogenesis, steatostasis or non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. the transcription factors ccaat/enhancer-binding proteins  are known to modulate gene expression leading to adipogenesis  <cit> . hence, we performed quantitative real-time pcr on β-c/ebp, δ-c/ebp, apolipoprotein m  and found that they were indeed up-regulated by hgcl <dig>  as suggested by transcriptome data. as shown in figure 4d and 4e, both β-c/ebp and δ-c/ebp were induced by hgcl <dig> at concentrations as low as  <dig> μg/l, suggesting that these transcription factors were very sensitive to mercury-induced lipid accumulation in the liver and are potential biomarkers for mercury exposure as well as for fatty-liver condition.

hgcl <dig> induced glycogen accumulation in liver
by periodic acid-schiff  staining, we observed increasing glycogen content, as indicated by the increased 'pink staining', in livers of zebrafish treated with increasing concentrations of hgcl <dig> . the increase of glycogen content in liver of mercury-treated zebrafish correlated with the up-regulation of gluconeogenesis based on transcriptome data . real-time pcr confirmed that gene expression for both glycogen phosphorylase  and glycogen synthase kinase  <dig>  were up-regulated by hgcl <dig> in a concentration-dependent manner . in addition, a previous study  <cit>  has shown significant elevation of glycogen level in vas deferens of male rat treated with hgcl <dig>  suggesting that mercury may cause metabolic disorders via increased level of glycogen.

comparative analysis revealed similarity of mercury- and arsenic-induced processes in zebrafish liver
we have previously reported that arsenic exposure in adult zebrafish caused decreased number of hepatic parenchyma cells as well as altered cell adhesion and cytoskeleton  <cit> . due to similarity of the toxicity effects between these two compounds, we compared transcriptome profiles between mercury and arsenic in the zebrafish liver using gsea. similar statistical criteria were used to select enriched pathways induced by arsenic . arsenic induced proteasome pathway and intrinsic apoptotic pathway as early as  <dig> h of arsenic exposure. unlike mercury, extrinsic apoptotic pathway is not enriched. also, dna damage signaling pathway was significantly up-regulated at  <dig> h of arsenic treatment although positive nes values were observed at an earlier time point. like the case of mercury, wnt signaling was also significantly down-regulated in asenic-treated livers. however, unlike mercury, gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis were down-regulated by arsenic  implying that there are different toxicity modes between these two compounds.

validation of targeted genes as potential biomarkers of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity
it is also important to identify genes whose expressions are sensitively induced by mercury exposure. based on stringent statistical criterion  and/or biological function of interest, we validated selected genes using real-time pcr. our data indicated that  <dig> genes i.e. fibrinogen alpha chain , complement factor b , angiotensinogen , p <dig> oxidoreductase homolog , gamma-glutamyl carboxylase , hypothetical loc <dig> , ubiquitin conjugation enzyme e2n , dna fragmentation factor , proteosome activator subunit  <dig> , proteosome 26s subunit , cytochrome c oxidase subunit viic  and succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit a  were up-regulated within  <dig> h of exposure to  <dig> μg/l of hg . this further confirmed biological processes such as proteasome degradation  and apoptosis , complement activation  and electron transport chain , acute phase response  were deregulated. however, only  <dig> genes i.e. por homolog, cox7c, sdha , hypothetical loc <dig>   and agt , and β-c/ebp and δ-c/ebp  were up-regulated by  <dig> to  <dig> μg/l of hgcl <dig>  suggesting that oxidative phosphorylation, complement system, acute phase response and lipid metabolism in the liver are highly sensitive to mercury exposure. these findings further imply the susceptibility of the liver to oxidative stress, complement activation, acute phase response and steatosis as a consequence of mercury exposure. the environmental limit of inorganic mercuric from the united states environmental protection agency  in drinking water is below  <dig> ppb  http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/contaminants/dw_contamfs/mercury.html. mercury content in human blood is normally within the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/l  <cit>  and the warning level of mercury in human blood is  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/l  <cit> . the reproducible, rapid and dose-dependent responsiveness of these genes to a range of hgcl <dig> concentrations from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/l suggested that these genes can be potentially used as robust biomarkers in combination with analytical chemistry detection of mercury for investigating and assessing the severity of mercury exposure. furthermore, related acute phase proteins such as angiotensinogen and complement factors that are synthesized in liver and secreted into blood and excreted in urine are potential clinical as well as toxicogenomic biomarkers for assessing health effects of mercury exposure and warrants further investigation  <cit> .

mechanistic insights into in vivo mercury-induced hepatotoxicity
taken together, our findings provide the following in vivo mechanistic insights into mercury-induced hepatotoxicity . as a strong thiol-binding agent, mercury causes protein damage and depletion of thiol-containing antioxidants . protein damage subsequently induces proteasome pathways as well as further disruption of cellular structure such as cell-cell adhesion and cell motility. this may explain the very steep acute toxicity curve  due to the rapid increase of toxicity when protective intracellular thiol-antioxidants have been depleted after a threshold  of hgcl <dig>  transcriptome data showed deregulation of key genes in glutathione metabolism , providing further evidence of disrupted thiol-antioxidants intracellular supply .

depletion of thiol-containing antioxidants will cause direct  and indirect  oxidative stress-mediated liver injury. direct oxidative stress induces dna damage, mitochondrial dysfunction such as increased oxidative phosphorylation or electron transport chain activity and reduced activity of fatty acid β-oxidation. these will subsequently cause induction of mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway to release caspase- <dig> to trigger apoptosis and cell death leading to liver injury. depletion of thiol-antioxidants results in the overall intracellular redox balance to shift towards increased oxidative stress, especially in the mitochondria where active oxidative phosphorylation occurs. this is evident from the transcriptome analysis indicating the deregulation of electron transport chain and mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation in at least  <dig> time-points , suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction occurring as early as  <dig> h of mercury exposure. moreover a shift from down-regulation of extrinsic apoptosis at  <dig> h time-point to up-regulation of mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic apoptosis signaling at  <dig> h time-point  strongly suggests increased mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular stress  <cit> . increased apoptosis was confirmed through real-time pcr of up-regulated dffa  as showed in figure  <dig> and immunohistochemical-staining of apoptotic dna fragments in figure  <dig>  some of the observed histological phenotypes in the liver parenchyma, such as irregular cell-shape, loose contact with neighboring cells and significantly reduced nucleated-cell count, may be attributed to morphological features of apoptosis  <cit>  as well as to mercury interaction with cytoskeletal proteins  <cit> . e-cadherin and keratin- <dig> staining further revealed the extent of the disrupted cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization corroborating with the deregulated actin pathway and cell motility process captured by the transcriptome data. unmitigated oxidative stress would cause cellular damage involving dna and proteins and lead to tissue injury as well as cell lysis/death, as suggested by the up-regulation of dna damage signaling, proteasome pathway, several acute phase protein genes  including complement activation. this further explains the down-regulation of cell cycle indicated in the transcriptome analysis which is necessary for dna repair and assessment of cellular damage, and if necessary, to induce cell death instead of cell proliferation.

in addition to direct mercury-induced oxidative cellular injury, our study has also captured indirect mercury-induced oxidative stress-mediated gene expression/regulation . depletion of cellular thiols and intracellular redox balance can alter activity in many transcription regulators and nuclear receptors  <cit>  as indicated by the early deregulation nuclear receptor signaling pathway  that include genes such as esr <dig>  and nr2f1l, further confirming the endocrine-disrupting effect of mercury  <cit> . our findings suggest that the liver is a mercury-targeted organ for endocrine disruption. in addition to hormonal receptors, the up-regulation of transcription regulators such as junb, β-c/ebp, δ-c/ebp, and keap <dig> suggested modulation of protective/defense and survival mechanisms involving genes associated with antioxidant response element   and acute phase response  . up-regulated glucocorticoid receptor signaling together with β-c/ebp could lead to gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis as indicated in the transcriptome analysis and pas staining of glycogen as shown in figure  <dig>  moreover, up-regulation β-c/ebp and δ-c/ebp showed in figure  <dig> together with the disruption of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation could lead to fat synthesis and accumulation. all these incidents can eventually lead to metabolic disorders that may cause further liver injury.

apart from transcription regulators, it was also observed that expression of genes encoding several kinases  were also affected suggesting that signal transduction via phosphorylation was altered by mercury-induce oxidative stress. modulation of kinases involved in mapk  pathways could result in up-regulation of hypoxia signaling  <cit> . furthermore, deregulated kinases such as gsk <dig> will trigger hypoxia-inducible pathways and intrinsic apoptotic pathway. gsk <dig> had been shown to activate intrinsic but not extrinsic apoptotic pathway  <cit>  and deregulate wnt signaling pathway  <cit>  as indicated in the transcriptome analysis. likewise, wnt signaling can act as negative regulator for adipogenesis  <cit>  as its down-regulation may also contribute to adipogenesis observed in the study.

finally, it should be pointed out that the analysis is based on the nominal concentration of mercury used in the exposure experiment and does not reflect the amount of mercury bioaccumulated in the tissue. future studies should include bioaccumulation of mercury in target tissues in order to relate the observed effects to its actual concentration in the tissues. this is important for assessing and comparing the actual degree of mercury exposure in the tissue with its corresponding toxicological responses from different studies.

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed in vivo mechanistic insights of mercury-induced hepatotoxicity that may imply complications associated with metabolic disorders. to our knowledge, this is the first report of an in vivo mechanistic model for mercury-induced toxicity in the liver. comparative analyses from arsenic-induced hepatotoxicity in zebrafish and human hepg <dig> cell line treated with hgcl <dig> showed some similar effects with mercury-induced hepatotoxicity in zebrafish. in addition, transcriptome analysis coupled with phenotypic anchoring and targeted gene validation had revealed that mercury can cause liver injury via broad processes associated to oxidative stress and cell death as well as deregulation of kinases such as gsk <dig> in regulating the activities of wnt signaling pathway, gluconeogenesis and adipogenesis that may eventually lead to syndromes such as mitochondrial dysfunction, endocrine disruption and metabolic disorders. moreover, targeted gene validation also identified genes whose expressions are sensitive to mercury exposure suggesting their potential use for detecting or diagnosing mercury-induced toxicity. thus, the understanding of the in vivo mechanism of hepatotoxicity using zebrafish could facilitate researches in toxicology and toxicogenomics, in particular in vivo heavy metal toxicity. these findings provide strong evidence of the feasibility of using zebrafish to model mercury-induced hepatotoxicity in human for risk assessment of mercury.
