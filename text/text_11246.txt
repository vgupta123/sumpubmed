BACKGROUND
the gastrointestinal  tract of the pig harbors a numerically dense and metabolically active microbiota comprised mainly of bacteria  <cit> . indeed, all animals have, and seemingly require, long-term cooperative associations with indigenous bacteria in the gi tract. studies with gnotobiotic animal models demonstrate most conclusively that indigenous bacteria stimulate the normal maturation of host tissues and provide key defense and nutritional functions  <cit> . this mutualistic relationship has been selected over evolutionary time resulting in a stable microbiota in mature animals that is generally similar in composition and function in a diverse range of animal species  <cit> .

despite evolutionary stability, the intestinal microbiota develops in individual animals in a characteristic successional pattern that requires substantial adaptation by the host during early life. the impact of the developing microbiota as well as the metabolic activities of climax communities require special consideration when viewed in the context of pig production in which efficiency of animal growth is a primary objective  <cit> .

the epithelial lining of the gi tract is characterized by a high cell turnover rate and the constant production of a protective mucus coat. together these two physiological processes provide effective innate defense against luminal threats including those emanating from normal gut bacteria. in fact, epithelial cell turnover and secretory activity are both profoundly affected by the numbers, types, and spatial distribution of gi bacteria, with the latter microbial features being influenced by both exogenous and endogenous  nutrients. innate defense functions afforded by the epithelium are provided at the expense of animal growth efficiency. specifically, gi tissues represent only 5% of body weight  but they receive a disproportionate fraction of cardiac output and contribute 15–35% of whole body oxygen consumption and protein turnover  <cit> . only 10% of the total protein synthesized by the gi tract is accumulated as new mass  <cit> ; most proteins are lost in sloughed epithelial cells or as secreted products such as mucus.

carriage of microbial populations capable of utilizing refractory plant components enabled feral pigs to exploit distinct habitats thereby enhancing survival and reproductive success. animal growth efficiency is, however, a concept introduced only upon domestication of the pig as a food animal. these issues provoke consideration of an optimal gut microbiota for intestinal health versus its effects on the efficiency of gastrointestinal and whole body growth throughout the productive life cycle of a pig. however, the normal microbiota of the pig intestine has received surprisingly little attention from an animal growth perspective. in the present study, laser capture microdissection  and microarray analysis were used to distinguish gene expression profiles in the small intestinal epithelium of gf versus conventional  neonatal piglets. the genetic pathways induced are consistent with the concept that the host responds to normal gut bacteria by mounting epithelial defenses that presumably impact the efficiency of whole animal growth.

RESULTS
microbial status and animal performance
bacterial colony growth was not observed on cultures of fecal swabs and cecal digesta of gf pigs indicating gf status was maintained. cecal colonization  in conv pigs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for total aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. all pigs appeared healthy with body weight gain  over the  <dig> day period of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for gf and conv pigs, respectively.

principal component analysis
pca analysis demonstrated that 60% of the variation in gene expression  was due to the state of microbial colonization . in contrast, 25% of the variation in gene expression  was due to an epithelial compartment effect . fifteen percent of the variation  did not follow a distinct pattern of treatment or compartment effect, perhaps indicating a treatment-compartment interaction, variation due to the technical procedures involved in sample preparation, sample variation  or a combination of these factors . thus, most of the variation in gene expression was due to the treatment effect with minor effects contributed by the epithelial-compartment and treatment-compartment interactions.

gene expression in crypt versus villi
seventy genes, involved in transcription, cell proliferation and differentiation, nutrient transport and metabolism, and immune responses were differentially expressed  in conv crypts compared with gf crypts . twelve genes, mainly involved in immune responsiveness, were significantly upregulated in conv versus gf villi . these results indicate that, relative to proliferative crypt epithelial cells, differentiated and short-lived villus epithelial cells are less responsive to microbial colonization-induced gene expression. because the state of microbial colonization elicited the greatest responses from the intestinal epithelium, subsequent analyses focused on the effects of intestinal microbiota irrespective of crypt versus villus compartment effects.

microbiota effects on intestinal epithelial gene expression
a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed  in the intestinal epithelium  of conv relative to gf animals. among them,  <dig> genes were upregulated, and  <dig> genes were downregulated in conv compared to gf epithelia. differentially expressed genes were categorized according to gene ontology  biological processes: 10% in transcription, 9% in signal transduction, 6% in cell proliferation, differentiation and regulation of cell growth, 5% in transport, 10% in metabolism, 4% in electron transport mechanisms, 5% in immune responsiveness, 23% were involved in 'other' processes and 28% encode genes of unknown function , which is consistent with known limitations in gene annotation in the current go database of porcine genes  <cit> .

gene transcription
conv animals exhibited increased expression of several genes encoding proteins involved in transcriptional processes such as dna directed rna polymerase-ii , drosophila sine oculis homeobox homolog  <dig> , signal transducer and activator of transcription- <dig> , transcriptional adaptor 3-like , and zinc finger protein- <dig>  . furthermore, microbial colonization induced mrna expression of retinoid × receptor beta , hla-b associated transcript- <dig> , and pre-b-cell leukemia transcription factor- <dig> , which are each encoded within the major histocompatibility complex  and may therefore be involved in some aspect of immunity  <cit> . on the other hand, conv animals exhibited lower expression of genes encoding gata binding protein- <dig> , transcription elongation factor a -like- <dig>  and methyl-cpg-binding protein- <dig>  .

1fold change is the ratio of conv versus gf.

signal transduction
most of the differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction processes were upregulated in conv animals  , indicating that receptor-mediated signaling cascades were activated by mutualistic microbes. the gene encoding protein kinase c gamma  was downregulated  in conv versus gf epithelia. intestinal epithelial cells express twelve known isoforms of pkc that play critical roles in intracellular signaling including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion, membrane remodeling, migration, ion secretion, and barrier function  <cit> . however, pkc-γ is one of the least explored isoforms of the pkc family and further studies are necessary to determine its involvement in the transduction of signals activated by intestinal microbes in ileal epithelial cells.

cell proliferation and differentiation
bacterial colonization downregulated the expression of various genes encoding proteins involved in cell apoptosis , downregulation of cell proliferation  and cytokinesis  . in addition, genes involved in cell proliferation , differentiation  and regulation of cell growth  and structural integrity  were upregulated in conv compared with gf piglets  indicating the involvement of a biotic stimulus that induces genes associated with epithelial cell turnover to protect the host from microbial colonization.

transport and metabolism
genes encoding atpase and solute carrier family- <dig> proteins, which are associated with cationic amino acid and monocarboxylic acid transport, were upregulated by intestinal microbiota . expression of genes encoding kelch-like- <dig> protein  and fatty acid binding protein , was significantly downregulated in conv piglets indicating differential expression of transport systems in conv versus gf pigs. intestinal microbiota downregulated glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  <dig>  expression whose product is involved in fructose metabolism. genes encoding glycogen phosphorylase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase associated with glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis were significantly upregulated in conv compared to gf animals, perhaps demonstrating a higher energy requirement of conv epithelial cells. with respect to lipid metabolism, expression of genes encoding acyl-coenzyme-a-synthetase and acyl-coenzyme-a-dehydrogenase related to fatty acid metabolism was significantly upregulated by the microbiota presumably to increase cellular energy supply. nutrient requirements of gf rodents are low compared to those colonized with a normal microbiota  <cit> .

resident microbiota inhibited expression of serine protease- <dig>  . the rna expression of the gene encoding the lysosomal protease cathepsin d  was significantly upregulated in conv piglets. furthermore, two genes encoding phosphatidylserine synthase- <dig> and glutamyl-trna synthetase, associated with amino acid metabolism and peptide biosynthesis respectively, were induced by microbial colonization . expression of the metallophosphoesterase- <dig> gene, whose product is involved in purine metabolism, was significantly upregulated, whereas expression of the thymidylate synthetase gene was downregulated  in conv versus gf animals. overall, microbial colonization induced the expression of genes involved in nutrient transport and carbohydrate, protein, lipid and nucleotide metabolism.

electron transport
the expression of several genes involved in electron transport such as flavin containing monooxygenase- <dig> , cytochrome p <dig>  family  <dig>  subfamily a, polypeptide  <dig> , acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase , aldo-keto reductase family  <dig>  member d <dig> , thioredoxin domain containing i  and cytochrome c oxidase  was significantly upregulated in conv versus gf animals . microbial colonization downregulated expression of nadh dehydrogenase   <dig> beta subcomplex,  <dig> , the product of which is associated with oxidative phosphorylation . these results demonstrate that microbiota induced genes involved in catalysis of various oxidative reactions.

immune responsiveness
consistent with the previous observations  <cit> , microbiota induced expression of the gene encoding bactericidal permeability-increasing protein , which damages bacterial inner/outer membranes and contributes to neutralization of bacterial lipopolysaccharide . the complex of mhc class i α-chain, beta  <dig> microglobulin , transporter- <dig> atp-binding cassette sub-family b , tapasin , calreticulin, and erp <dig> comprises the peptide-loading complex for mhc class i antigen processing  <cit> . these genes are characteristically induced in response to inflammatory cues and increased expression of swine leukocyte antigen classical class i , b2m, tap <dig> and tapbp, in the current study, likely reflects microbiota induced epithelial inflammation. enhanced expression of hspa <dig>  in conv animals further confirms this outcome as this gene is also induced by ifnβ  <cit> .

identification of significantly enriched biological processes
gotm analysis was performed to investigate whether certain biological processes or interactions were significantly enriched compared with all genes on the array. go terms are connected into nodes of a network, thus the connections between 'parents'  and 'children'  are illustrated as directed acyclic graphs . the broad biological process "response to stimulus" and its child "response to biotic stimulus" followed by the more specific process "immune response" were significantly affected by the microbiota. the go consortium defines "response to biotic stress" as "a change in the state of an organism in the presence of a biotic stimulus, including response to bacteria, fungi, pest/pathogens/parasite"  <cit> . the ileal microbiota also significantly modulated three additional biological processes including the janus activated kinase-stat  cascade, peptide transport, and regulation of hydrolase activity. the specific genes comprised within these significant biological processes are listed in additional file  <dig> 

class prediction analysis
class prediction analysis was performed using genespring gx  <dig> . <dig> . all genes on the array were examined individually and ranked based on their power to discriminate gf versus conv epithelia using cutoff points  and support vector machine algorithms. p-values were computed with fischer's exact test to determine associations between state of microbial colonization  and normalized expression level for each gene. thirteen of the  <dig> top-scoring predictive genes including hla-b, tap <dig>  b2m, interferon-induced protein 44-like , and stat <dig> were differentially expressed in conv versus gf epithelia . this outcome further supports the conclusion that microbial colonization activated the expression of stat <dig> and the induction of interferon-inducible genes.

gene network interactions
biological interactions among the selected genes were identified using ingenuity pathways analysis software   <cit> . among  <dig> differentially expressed genes, ingenuity pathways analysis identified  <dig> genes contributing to a total of nine molecular networks. each of networks  <dig> to  <dig> contains more than  <dig> genes, which are associated with immune response, cell growth and proliferation, dna replication and recombination, cellular development and immune response, and cell death, respectively. networks  <dig> to  <dig> were also interconnected and merged together to build a combined network representing the underlying biology . the composite network showed direct literature-supported relationships and further confirmed the ifn receptor-mediated activation of transcription factors stat <dig> and stat <dig>  which are involved in the expression of ifn-inducible target genes such as hla-b, b2m, tap <dig>  tapbp and socs <dig> in conv compared with gf animals. therefore, for validation, we focused on this regulatory pathway along with toll-like receptor -mediated activation and regulation of immune responses by qrt-pcr.

candidate genes for qrt-pcr
twenty three genes were chosen for two purposes:  to validate expression patterns of differentially expressed genes in the microarray studies, and  to examine possible regulatory mechanisms involved in microbiota-induced epithelial gene expression. first, eight genes , b2m, hspa <dig>  socs <dig>  ifngr <dig>  ifnar <dig>  lifr, and stat1) that were differentially expressed according to microarray analysis were assayed by qrt-pcr. second, the expression of fourteen non-differentially expressed  genes, which contribute to tlr and ifn receptor-mediated regulation of immune responses was determined by qrt-pcr. these targets included tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> , interleukin  <dig> , ifngr <dig>  myeloid differentiation protein- <dig>  tollip, traf family member-associated nf-κb activator -binding kinase- <dig> , inhibitor of κb kinase epsilon , nuclear factor κb , nf-kappa-b inhibitor alpha , ifn-regulatory factor  <dig> , irf <dig>  ifr <dig>  peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ , and stat <dig> .

1values are means ± se, n = 3/ <dig> per treatment group. rna was isolated from ileal sample of gf versus conv piglets using trizol reagent. quantitative rt-pcr analysis of gene expression was determined by quantitect sybr green rt-pcr master mix in a 384-well plate using an abi prism  <dig> ht ss instrument.

the mrna expression patterns for the eight differentially expressed genes detected by microarray analysis were also differentially expressed when assayed by qrt-pcr confirming the microarray data. expression patterns of  <dig> of  <dig> non-differentially expressed genes detected by microarray analysis were also similar when assayed by qrt-pcr. however, four genes , which exhibited similar levels of expression on the array were significantly upregulated in conv versus gf pigs when analyzed by qrt-pcr possibly indicating the higher sensitivity of qrt-pcr in detecting some transcripts or splice variation in transcripts  <cit> . overall, rt-pcr results validate the microarray data and demonstrate good correlation between two assays.

discussion
general
in the present study, the combination of lcm with microarray and qrt-pcr analyses was used to measure host gene expression profiles induced by the microbiota in the ileal epithelium of neonatal piglets, an in vivo model that preserves the contributions of other cell lineages and environmental factors in shaping the response. differentially expressed genes involved in biological processes such as epithelial cell turnover, nutrient transport and metabolism, xenobiotic metabolism, jak-stat signaling pathway, and immune responsiveness were upregulated by the intestinal microbiota. gene network analysis also revealed that microbial colonization activated both type i  and type ii  interferon receptor mediated signaling cascades leading to enhanced expression of stat <dig>  stat <dig> and irf <dig> transcription factors and the induction of ifn-inducible genes as a reflection of intestinal epithelial inflammation. enhanced expression of nfκbia and tollip and downregulation of gata <dig> in colonized versus gf animals might reflect the activation of pathways that prevent excessive inflammation. overall, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the intestinal epithelium maintains a physiological state of inflammation, due to continuous microbial exposure, that results in a tight intestinal barrier, which serves to minimize antigen translocation to the lamina propria and unwarranted inflammatory responses to mutualistic microbes.

microbial induction of barrier function
consistent with the maintenance of an intact mucosal barrier, thirteen genes contributing to cell proliferation, differentiation and regulation of cell growth were upregulated by bacterial colonization. in addition, expression of a gene involved in tnf receptor-mediated cell apoptosis was downregulated by resident microbiota  <cit> . consistent with observations that goblet cell products provide innate protection that influences bacterial colonization  <cit> , upregulation of beta  <dig> -galactosyltransferase  mrna expression for mucin biosynthesis  <cit>  in conv piglets may reflect a general mucogenic response in conventionalized animals to maintain barrier function  <cit> .

toll-like receptor-mediated signaling
the promotion of barrier function might be an inherent feature of mutualistic microbiota-induced tlr-mediated signaling  <cit> . in addition to the myd88-dependent pathway that promotes rapid nfκb activation, tlrs also trigger myd88-independent, ifn receptor-mediated signal transduction cascades upon the recognition of a variety of microbe-associated molecular patterns. these cascades activate members of the irf family along with slow activation of nfκb  <cit> . the expression of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  myd <dig>  tbk <dig>  ikbke, irf <dig>  and irf <dig> was unaffected but ifnar <dig>  ifngr <dig>  and irf <dig> were induced by microbial colonization as determined by qrt-pcr analysis. a myd88-independent pathway has been shown to activate irfs and subsequently ifn-inducible genes in human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells  <cit> , and mouse macrophages  <cit> . similarly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking myd <dig> retained the ability to induce ifnα/β mrna expression in response to viruses  <cit> . myd <dig> is not required for the regulation of the majority of genes responsive to lps and several myd88-independent mouse genes contain nfκb and ifn-stimulated response element  binding sites  <cit> . myd88-deficient mice also mount a normal host defense response to staphylococcus aureus infection  <cit> . however, inflammatory responses during polymicrobial sepsis in mice deficient for myd <dig> were markedly reduced implicating the importance of this signal transduction molecule in certain inflammatory scenarios  <cit> . the present study demonstrates that a myd88-independent, ifn receptor-mediated pathway was activated by the intestinal microbiota in ileal epithelial cells of neonatal piglets, possibly reflecting a state of controlled inflammation. a potential limitation of the current study was the measurement of epithelial responses at a single time point  <dig> days after colonization. an early induction of tlr-mediated inflammation might have gradually become adapted to the continuous microbial exposure enabling a state of cellular homeostasis.

ifn-mediated signaling
the data indicate that ifn receptor-mediated signaling cascades stimulated the expression of ifn-inducible genes in the ileal epithelium of conv piglets. interferon receptor complex ifnar consists of two subunits ifnar <dig> and ifnar <dig>  and ifngr is comprised of ifngr <dig> and ifngr <dig> subunits  <cit> . stimulation of ifnar or ifngr via the inflammatory cytokines ifnα/β and ifnγ activates receptor-associated janus protein tyrosine kinases  and the transcription factors stat <dig> and stat <dig>  <cit> . the phosphorylated stat1/stat <dig> heterodimers associate with ifr <dig> and bind to upstream regulatory consensus sequences of ifnα/β inducible genes   <cit> . in addition, formation of stat <dig> homodimers stimulates transcription of genes containing ifnγ-activated sequence   <cit> . in the present study, microbiota activated ifn receptor-mediated signaling cascades possibly through stat <dig>  stat <dig> and irf <dig> transcription factors to induce ifn-inducible target genes such as pan sla i, b2m, hspa <dig>  tap <dig>  tapbp, ifi44l and socs <dig> in conv compared with gf epithelia. kawai et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the induction of ifnα/β mrna was markedly inhibited in irf7-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts and irf <dig> activation was tbk1- and ikkε-independent in mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells. furthermore, rhee et al.  <cit>  reported that enteric salmonella infection induced the expression of ifnγ regulated genes involved in antimicrobial defense in mice. ifnα/β signaling upregulates ifnγ production in t cells and dendritic cells  <cit> . upregulation of ifnar <dig> and ifngr <dig> expression by the intestinal microbiota in the current study indicates that ifnα/β as well as ifnγ signaling pathways were activated in epithelial cells. the transcription factor stat <dig> is common for both and crosstalk between these signaling pathways was reported by takaoka et al.  <cit> . therefore, stat <dig> contributes to regulation of genes containing isre as well as gas elements  <cit>  and reciprocally affect each other's production and signaling  <cit> . furthermore, socs <dig> is known to regulate the ifn signaling pathway by controlling stat <dig> induction  <cit> . overall, these results indicate that mutualistic microbes may activate ifn receptor-mediated signaling cascades in intestinal epithelial cells leading to activation of the transcription factors stat <dig> and stat <dig> and ifn-inducible genes harboring the cis-regulatory elements isre and gas.

regulation of inflammatory processes
resident microbiota can inhibit nfκb nuclear localization  <cit>  and tlr <dig> induction  <cit>  and thereby possibly prevent overt inflammatory responses. in the present study, microbial colonization induced nfκbia expression, which encodes i-kappa-b-alpha, , a protein associated with the inactivation of nfκb by sequestering it in the cytoplasm, consistent with inhibition of nfκb mediated inflammatory responses  <cit> . this outcome together with the induction of tollip expression in conv piglets possibly contributed to the suppression of an excessive inflammatory response to maintain intestinal homeostasis. tollip inhibits tlr signaling by interfering with il- <dig> receptor-associated kinase   <cit> . indeed, intestinal epithelial cells express low levels of tlr <dig> and high levels of tollip to prevent excessive inflammation  <cit> .

the transcription factor gata- <dig> upregulates tnfα-induced mrna expression of chemokines eotaxin, rantes and monocyte chemotactic protein- <dig>  in airway epithelial cells  <cit> . downregulation of gata <dig> might have also contributed to intestinal homeostasis by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory chemokines. however, a comparatively low activation of nfκb along with steady-state activation of ifn receptor-mediated gene induction was maintained in the intestinal epithelium of animals harboring microbiota. this finding is consistent with an earlier report on the same model of an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes in the small intestine of conv versus gf piglets  <cit> .

this physiological state of inflammation was also associated with enhanced expression of genes associated with cell proliferation. nfκb is constitutively active in tumor cell lines derived from hematopoietic and solid tumors  <cit>  and epithelial malignancies including colorectal, breast, lung, pancreas, and prostate cancers  <cit> . suppression of nfκb in tumor samples inhibits proliferation, causes cell cycle arrest, and leads to apoptosis  <cit> . in addition to carcinoma cells, nfκb is also active in proliferating t cells, b cells, thymocytes, monocytes and astrocytes  <cit>  indicating a crucial role of nfκb in cell proliferation. furthermore, enhanced expression of lifr in conv piglets is consistent with involvement of its product in epithelial cell proliferation. lif, a member of the inflammatory il- <dig> cytokine family  <cit> , induced proliferation of premalignant epithelial cells  <cit>  and stimulates self-proliferation of embryonic stem cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study indicates that microbial colonization transcriptionally induces the expression of cell membrane receptors and transcription factors, which are involved in the induction of ifn-inducible genes. furthermore, overt inflammatory responses were possibly controlled through the induction of nfκbia and tollip and down-regulation of gata <dig> expression, consistent with the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. collectively, the study supports the concept that the intestinal epithelium maintains a physiological state of inflammation with respect to continuous microbial exposure, which serves to maintain a tight intestinal barrier, without engendering overt inflammatory responses that would compromise barrier function.
