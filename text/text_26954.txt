BACKGROUND
current technology encourages the study of biological phenomena on a genome-wide scale. technological platforms such as microarrays, next-generation sequencing, and mass spectrometry have resulted in generation of data on an unprecedented scale  <cit> . inadvertently, the field of bioinformatics which includes high-performance cloud computing, adaptation of statistical methods, design of novel algorithms and generation of databases, play critical roles in the analysis of these massive and diverse datasets  <cit> . the variation in the type and amount of biological data, coupled with the fact that investigators may sometimes be confronted with a question that cannot be answered using current statistical techniques or algorithms  <cit> , means that the field of statistical methods and algorithms is under constant refinement, adaptation and improvement  <cit> .

today, analysis of data from high-throughput experiments often yields a set of high-dimensional variable  list which typically represent a particular phenotype with respect to another. such hdv lists commonly include signature lists of expressed genes, loci or proteins. subsequent types of analysis to be performed on the gene list, depend greatly on the biological question an investigator is interested in. the work has been greatly simplified, partly due to the presence of many databases that were created, mostly in recent years  <cit> . the wealth of raw or curated, but nonetheless collated information in these databases is often critical in the subsequent analysis of gene  lists derived from these high-throughput experiments.

one of the most common analyses one could perform with a set of gene lists is an enrichment study of biological functions, processes or pathways with respect to a well-annotated reference gene list which commonly includes all the annotated genes in the genome. this analysis is commonly termed gene ontology analysis  <cit>  which is based on simple statistical tests such as hypergeometric, binomial, or chi-square tests  <cit> . these statistical tests could also be used if one is merely interested in whether one list of genes is similar to another, e.g. whether the gene products differentially expressed in human breast cancer  are similar to the gene products differentially expressed in human ovarian cancer  <cit> . in addition, complementary methods such as gene set enrichment analysis  allow the assessment of the relative relevance of one gene list of interest with reference to the expression differences of ranked genes between two phenotype cell classes of an organism  <cit> .

despite improvements in experimental technology and techniques, poor reproducibility and stability of results from independent but similar experiments can often hinder scientific discovery. these issues can arise due to many reasons such as small sample size  <cit> , high-noise data  <cit> , use of different technological platforms as well as poorly reported clinical or research protocols   <cit> . in particular, small sample sizes, in combination with technical and biological noises, often complicate efforts to identify statistical differences of expression signals between many functionally important genes of distinct tumor subtypes or clinical groups. these limitations lead to bias in signature predictions and poor consistency. inconsistency, divergence and poor overlap of many dozen of reported signatures suggest that our knowledge of nature and space dimensionality of tumor-associated genes and potential biomarkers is essentially incomplete  <cit> . identification of potential biomarker space can reveal specific genetic patterns of cancer cells, for example, cell junctions in non-small cell lung cancer subtypes  <cit> . our recent integrative studies of microarray gene expression profiles in lung adenocarcinoma  versus normal adjacent lung tissue suggested that space dimensionality of potential biomarkers of lung adenocarcinoma  is at least  <dig> known genes  <cit> . among these, hundreds of genes could be essential for disease-driving because they encode proteins containing mutagenesis sites, implying that these genes could be considered as relevant for diagnostic or prognostic applications  <cit> . in bc, the number of the genes that grade primary tumor by its aggressiveness is even larger; it consists of ~ <dig> microarray u133a detected genes  <cit> .

to the best of our knowledge, current statistical analysis of matched lists mostly centres on comparison of two lists  <cit> . for example, independent studies of prostate cancer from two different countries may each yield a set of gene lists where genes are ranked by biological relevance, either by the magnitude of fold change, statistical significance of differential expression or other statistical measures. the comparison of the two gene lists based on robustness and stability can then be evaluated using a recently published method, which incorporates permutation studies and uses canberra distance as the measure of dissimilarity  <cit> . however, methods which evaluate elements of one  list with reference to many other  lists is required in certain disciplines, including bioinformatics, genome-associated disease studies, medical statistics, epidemiology, ecology and authorship identification etc  <cit> .

in cancer research, advances in high-throughput experimental techniques as well as statistical algorithms have resulted in the discovery of many gene signature sets  which are representative of a particular cancer phenotype based on patient prognosis, tumor subtypes or other molecular features. however, it was reported that many of the gsss generally do not show strong consensus for a given disease, even for more clinically homogeneous sub-groups of a disease  when independent patient cohorts are compared  <cit> . in bc, two well-known signatures which predict bc recurrence, comprising of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were derived independently in amsterdam and rotterdam cohorts respectively  <cit> . however, only three genes were found to be common. nevertheless, it was stated that the rest of the unique genes could share similar pathways and be associated with similar mechanisms leading to the disease.

recently, a systematic collection of gene expression signatures in cancers have been identified and collected in several databases  <cit> . for example, abba et al. have collected  <dig> bc gene expression signatures in an effort to identify the most relevant bc biomarkers  <cit> . comparison of these  <dig> signatures revealed limited or zero overlap between signatures. specifically, comparison of the  <dig> distinct gene symbols revealed that only  <dig> genes  are found in at least  <dig> signatures, which indicates the great disparity across gene signatures. the reasons for the disparity have been attributed to differences in clinical attributes of patients analysed which include er status, stages, histological patterns, disease subtypes and treatment received by the patients.

also, it is likely that each of the signatures represented only a partial picture of the heterogeneous and complex bc biology, which subsequently limits its potential for clinical implementation. the authors demonstrated that selection of several of these signatures having better consensus may provide more relevant and robust cancer biomarkers  <cit> . however, their strategy has a bias towards the larger size signatures and over-representation of cell cycle related genes. other authors published a systematic review of gene expression signatures in colorectal cancer and identified  <dig> prognostic gene signatures  <cit> . it was reported that these gene lists, comprising a total of  <dig> genes do not show great overlap, as there were only two common genes in four signatures,  <dig> common genes in three signatures, and  <dig> common genes in two signatures. it was stated by the authors that "the lack of gene overlap is generally interpreted as if each signature is a random sampling of a small subset of genes from a larger signature that represent the involved pathways  <cit> ." however, without strong agreement and reproducibility of the gene signatures from independent studies, future large-scale prospective validation studies are unlikely to proceed, and may prove to be a major hindrance in achieving the desired goals of biomarker-based disease diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of therapeutic efficacy.

many of the available biomarkers were generated in connection with biological functions of a given medical condition/disease. however, identity of the biomarkers for the same medical condition/disease could be quite different due to differences in the study design or analytical methods. generally, it is very difficult to compare the gsss due to such poorly-controlled variations in the process of discovery. however at times, it would be interesting to know how many times a particular gid in a newly derived signature has been reported in other known and reference gsss  and whether the presence of the gid in these rgsss occurs more frequently than expected by chance.

in our work, we address medical bioinformatics issues via computational intelligence, statistical analysis and computational simulation. here, we proposed that a randomized sampling approach can provide a confidence indication of whether a gene is likely to be a common  potential biomarker present in many other gsss, or whether it is a relatively unique biomarker specific to a particular biological or disease state.

RESULTS
definition of novel or common biomarkers
traditional definition of novel biomarkers typically involves an absolute threshold value of  <dig>  where only biomarkers which are not present in other published reference gene signature subsets  are defined as novel biomarkers . in contrast, biomarkers which are present in at least one published rgss are defined as "known" biomarkers. however, this definition does not account for the number of rgsss under comparison, as well as ignore the variation in the number of biomarkers across rgsss. for example, a biomarker present in only one of hundreds of rgsss might be considered as a "statistically novel  biomarker".

to address the above-mentioned issues, we first propose the construction of the observed frequency distribution function that describes the number of published rgsss that contain each of the genes from the gene signature of interest. this function has a skewed shape with long right side tail. more precisely, the observed frequencies have the following characteristics in common: there are few frequent, and many rare events . such skewed functions are often observed in many natural and technological processes  null or background frequency distribution  has a relatively shorter right-side tail. such function could be described by the exponential distribution function or poison distribution function. the identification of bfd and 'de-noising' of the empirical pareto-like distribution function is a great challenge, specifically when sample sizes are relatively small  <cit> .

we propose a simulation-based approach of random sampling to generate an expected bfd of the number of published rgsss expected by chance to contain each of the genes from the gss of interest  . the method of random sampling to generate the bfd provides a fair basis of evaluating a significance measure of the empirical frequency of the number of the published rgsss that contain each of the genes from the signature of interest. implicitly, it takes into account the number of rgsss under comparison, as well as taking into account the size variation across rgsss. effectively, it extends a vertical dimension  to facilitate identification of statistically novel  or common  biomarkers .

to discriminate between sn and sc biomarkers within tgss derived from genome-scale data, we assume that the identity of individual element  is sufficiently well recorded as a potential biomarker, if that element appeared in the other lists more than r times . with this assumption, we can compare the null bfd with actual empirical frequency distribution  and at the given confidence level, estimate a critical cut-off value of signature co-occurrences which subsequently allows us to discriminate biomarkers as sn or sc.

description of method
an illustration of our proposed methodology is shown in figure  <dig>  we first define a background gene list which is a superset of all gene signatures. appropriately, a background gene list could be defined as all human gene symbols or a subset of genes such as only those represented on a particular microarray platform. genes in signatures which are not in the background gene list are removed. for each gene in a newly derived gene signature , the number of co-occurrences in m other published rgsss is counted  . the efd of number of genes for each co-occurrence events with the published rgsss can be counted and plotted.

to generate the null bfd, several rounds of simulation are performed. in each simulation, random gene lists rsi =  <dig> , <dig> ..m of equal sizes  are generated from the background gene list, without replacement within each simulation and with replacement between two simulations . the number of co-occurrences of overlap between genes in as <dig> with rsi =  <dig> , <dig> ..m are counted in each simulation, and summed across all simulations. subsequently, a null bfd of the number of gid matches with the random gene lists can be generated, which represents the expected frequency distribution of gid matches.

effect of background gene list
we first performed studies on simulated data to establish the family of null distributions that may result from this analysis. specifically, the effect of the size of the background gene list, i.e. the effect of biomarker space on the null bfd is of interest. the background gene list, d, is first assumed to comprise of  <dig>  genes. we assume that our gene signature, as <dig> contains  <dig> genes, i.e. |as0| =  <dig>  next, we assume that  <dig> other well-defined gene signatures are reported in the literature, each containing an unequal number of genes, e.g. |as1|= <dig>  |as2|= <dig>  |as3|= <dig>  |as4|= <dig>  |as5|= <dig>  |as6|= <dig>  |as7|= <dig>  |as8|= <dig>  |as9|= <dig> and |as10|= <dig> 

subsequently, we performed  <dig> simulations where in each simulation, the actual gene sets  are simulated by sampling the same number of genes independently from d without replacement. the expected frequency of observed co-occurrences of each gene in our gene signature can be determined.

similar analyses are performed by repeating the procedures with reduced background gene lists . the effect of the size of the background gene lists can be observed in figure  <dig>  in addition, the expected null bfd can be approximated and fitted using weibull or sigmoid functions.

analysis of 36-genes prognostic signature for epithelial ovarian cancer
in our previous work  <cit> , we studied expression and clinical data from patients diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, and subsequently identified a 36-mrna signature  which stratifies patients into subgroups with very distinct and varied overall survival rates: low, intermediate or high-risk, with  <dig> year overall survival rates of 65%, 20% and 10% respectively. in addition to its prognostic significance, the 36-mrna signature is also predictive of patients' response to chemo-therapy.

we compared our 36-gene tgss with other published rgsss of ovarian cancer. from the literature, we collected  <dig> rgsss which were previously reported to show associations with survival, disease subtype, chemo-sensitivity, disease detection, development, progression or recurrence . we restrict our analysis to official gene symbols present in the background gene set . after pre-processing of the gene symbols, each of the  <dig> rgsss contain between  <dig> to  <dig> gene symbols. subsequently, via  <dig> independent simulations, we generated a null bfd of overlap between our tgss  with the randomly generated lists of signatures. additionally, to understand the effect of the number of simulations on the null bfds, we performed  <dig> and  <dig> independent simulations.

the results of the comparison of our tgss with other rgsss are shown in table  <dig> and figure 4a .

analysis of obesity and igf <dig> signatures in breast cancer
recently, the link between obesity and its contribution to poorer disease outcome in bc has been reported. creighton and sada et al. studied the effects of obesity on primary breast tumor gene expression and their results revealed an obesity-associated cancer transcriptional signature of  <dig> genes   <cit> . after preprocessing, this tgss contains  <dig> refseq gene symbols . subsequently, we investigate whether individual genes in this obesity-associated tgss derived from bc tumors are significantly enriched among the  <dig> bc rgsss which were previously reported to be associated with clinical observations such as response to chemotherapy, distant metastasis, er-alpha status, tumor subtypes and grades, as well as clinical outcomes such as patient prognosis. the  <dig> rgsss comprise  <dig> gene signatures reviewed by abba et al.  <cit>  as well as those manually curated by us . the background gene list consists of all refgene symbols downloaded from ucsc genome browser on 30th november  <dig> and any gene that is not found within the background gene list is excluded from subsequent analysis.

as described in the methods, we performed  <dig> independent simulations and the enrichment of the genes in rgsss relative to random expectation are shown in figure 4b . overall, our results indicated that a large proportion of the obesity-associated tgss genes have been reported as biomarkers in more bc rgsss than expected from random simulations. for instance, based on random simulations, only  <dig> % of the obesity-associated signature is expected to be found in at least  <dig> other rgsss. however,  <dig> of  <dig>  genes from the obesity-associated tgss are actually found in at least  <dig> other rgsss.

also, it has been suggested that the link between obesity and bc outcome could be due to increased endocrine signaling involving insulin and insulin-like growth factors   <cit> . specifically igf <dig>  whose expression is elevated in human breast cancer  <cit> , is known to increase breast cancer cell growth and invasion  <cit> . furthermore, activation of igf <dig> pathway is correlated with early recurrence and decreased relapse-free survival  <cit> .

therefore, in subsequent analysis, we studied an igf <dig> pathway gene signature  whose genes were differentially expressed in mcf- <dig> bc cell line after igf <dig> stimulation and which were correlated with several poor prognostic factors and disease outcome in patients with bc  <cit> . this igf <dig> pathway tgss contains  <dig> genes after gene identifier conversion and preprocessing. similar analyses were performed for this tgss with respect to the  <dig> other bc rgsss and the results are shown in figure 4c . similar to the obesity-associated tgss, our results indicated that genes belonging to the igf1-tgss are generally found to co-occur in more rgsss than expected from random simulations. specifically,  <dig> % of the igf1-signature genes are found in at least  <dig> rgsss, which is  <dig>  times more than expected.

when we compared the efds for both the obesity-associated tgss and igf <dig> pathway tgss, results suggested that there is a stronger association of the igf <dig> pathway tgss's genes with the  <dig> bc rgsss than observed for the obesity-associated tgss's genes with the  <dig> bc rgsss .

next, we studied both the obesity and igf <dig> tgsss of bc with respect to the mapk signalling pathway. from the kegg database, the mapk signalling pathway comprises of  <dig> genes, which included a list of  <dig> genes  which are present in either or both of obesity-associated tgss and the igf <dig> pathway tgss . subject to a minimum threshold of four rgsss, genes present in at least one of the obesity or igf <dig> tgsss could be considered as sc gids. on the other hand, genes in either the obesity or igf1-associated tgsss that occur in three or less rgsss are termed sn gids . typically, such genes which individually occur less frequently in other rgsss are not easily interpreted with respect to their association with disease pathways or phenotypes. on the other hand, our method identifies many dozen genes of mapk signalling pathway which have not been considered as a common bc signature in context of their functional association of obesity, igf <dig> pathway and bc.

discussion
in this work, we developed a method for the identification of gene subsets that are statistically novel  or common  in a newly defined signature of interest when compared to other  reference gene signature sets  that are representative of a medical condition .

we first provide an application of our methodology to one of our gene signature previously identified for the prognosis of patients diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian cancer  <cit> . our prognostic signature comprise of  <dig> mrna genes . for this analysis, we manually curate  <dig> gene sets from the literature which were reported to show associations with survival, disease subtype, chemo-sensitivity, disease detection, development, progression or recurrence . our analysis revealed that more than 50% of the genes in our 36-gene prognostic signature were not previously considered as potential biomarkers in any of the curated publications . these genes include arpc1b, cct <dig>  cd <dig>  cdk <dig>  dnmt <dig>  fgfr <dig>  fzd <dig>  hgf, mis <dig>  ncapd <dig>  ncapg <dig>  ncaph, pik3r <dig>  plaur, pola <dig>  polr2d, polr2j, tgfbr <dig> and vcl. despite the absence of these genes in currently known gene sets associated with the different aspects of ovarian cancers, some of these were nonetheless shown to play critical roles in cancer development and progression. for instance, it was shown that the majority of epithelial ovarian cancer tumors exhibited positive staining for fzd <dig>  <cit> , and it was associated with chemo-resistance via the wnt/beta-catenin pathway  <cit> . similarly for hgf, deregulated hgf/met signaling is a common hallmark of many tumors and is associated with various aspects of tumor progression  <cit> . furthermore, elevated hgf serum levels could predict poor prognosis in advanced ovarian cancers  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, although fzd <dig> and hgf have not been reported as high-confidence biomarkers in ovarian cancer, their values as prognostic markers should not be neglected as is often the case. in fact in our previous analysis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients, both fzd <dig> and hgf exhibited significant prognostic properties .

on the other hand, genes such as ccl <dig>  pdgfra, tubb, col3a <dig> and ednra have previously been identified as relevant biomarkers in at least  <dig> other published gene sets . for instance, ednra, either independently or in combination with other biomarkers, was reported to be able to predict benign and malignant tumors from borderline tumors  <cit> , tumor subtype classification  <cit>  and classification of tumors related to cell plasticity  <cit> . col3a <dig> is also a commonly studied gene in ovarian cancer, where it was revealed that it is one of the most expressed proteins in advanced relative to local ovarian adenocarcinoma  <cit> , and that its expression was observed to be higher in platinum-resistant relative to platinum-sensitive cells  <cit> . its use as a biomarker in prediction of chemo-sensitivity or platinum-sensitivity  <cit> , determination of tumor subtype  <cit>  or molecular subtype  <cit> , and classification of tumors related to cell plasticity  <cit>  was previously reported. our data also indicated that both ednra and col3a <dig> showed significant prognostic properties in patients diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian cancer .

in fact, our signature was originally derived for patient prognosis and prediction of chemo-sensitivity. in this analysis, we further found that certain genes in our 36-gene signature could be also relevant in tumor subtype classification. also, we show that survival curves of several of our biomarkers show significance in patient stratification, regardless of whether they have been or not been reported in previous publications of ovarian cancer .

next, we also studied two bc signatures from two published research reports . the first signature was derived from differential expression analysis of obese versus non-obese bc patients  <cit> . the second signature was derived from differentially regulated genes in mcf- <dig> cells after igf <dig> stimulation  <cit> . independent comparison of these two signatures with the  <dig> bc rgsss revealed that a larger proportion of genes from the igf <dig> pathway gene signature were more likely to be represented in the rgsss when compared to expectations from random simulation . this might suggest a tighter association between the igf <dig> signaling pathway with clinical observations such as response to chemotherapy, distant metastasis, er-alpha status, tumor subtypes and grades, as well as clinical outcomes such as patient prognosis. in contrast, while we showed slight association between the obesity-associated gene signature with the rgsss , this association appear to be weaker when compared to that of the igf <dig> signaling pathway . this seems to suggest that the probable effects of obesity on cancer association could be less specific or directed, when compared to that of the igf <dig> signaling pathway. our method allows us to quantify a measure of associations between obesity, igf <dig> pathway and bc signatures, as well as predict potentially sc and sn therapeutic target genes.

additionally, using our published data-driven prognostic analytical method  <cit> , we studied the survival significance of sn gids  and sc gids  of bc . expression levels of sc gids such as il6st and dusp <dig>  which were found in  <dig> and  <dig> bc rgsss respectively , were found to be able to stratify both stockholm and uppsala bc patient cohorts into two survival significant subgroups via the data-driven grouping method . genes that were less studied and less represented in other rgsss were traditionally neglected in terms of their prognostic capability. however, we show that expression levels of genes such as pik3c <dig> and appbp <dig>  which were not found in any of the  <dig> bc rgsss , could also stratify both stockholm and uppsala patient cohort into two survival significant subgroups .

while our general schema allows us to uncover the null background frequency distribution  of expected co-occurrences of our tss's genes with other well-defined rgsss, the specific use of this approach requires a careful formulation of the null hypothesis. therefore, the background gene set d needs to be judiciously defined. in our example studies of bc and hg-soc, we have defined the background gene set d as all annotated refseq gene symbols. however, sometimes it may be necessary to restrict the set of background gene list d to the list of genes that are tested, e.g. probesets on a microarray platform. the effect of a smaller background gene set d is non-trivial. our simulated experiments on reduced background gene sets  clearly revealed the rightward shift of the null bfd as the background gene set becomes more restricted . the interpretation of the actual empirical frequency distribution  and null bfd is therefore context-dependent and depends on the selection of the background gene list and other rgsss. therefore, the selection of the background set is non-trivial, and should generally be guided by the design of the experiments or formulation of the hypotheses.

we also studied the effect of the number of simulations on the null bfd. for each of the three tgsss analysed, we generated null bfd from  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> random and independent simulations . our results show that generally,  <dig> simulations are sufficient to uncover the structure and shape of the null bfd, which is representative of the percentage of tgss that is expected to be found in the rgsss at various levels of overlap counts. increasing the number of simulations  might increase the sensitivity of our method in detecting random genes that likely appear in more rgsss, but this is at the expense of higher computational cost.

finally, in order to obtain a meaningful expected null bfd, the use of the method requires a considerable size of the signature of interest  and the number of other well-defined rgsss . therefore, the rapidly growing number of databases as well as the accumulating wealth at databases including but not limited to gene expression omnibus   <cit> , arrayexpress  <cit> , genesigdb  <cit> , meant that analysis of a newly generated gene lists with these previously defined gene sets could become more feasible. certainly, the selection of the previously defined gene sets from the public repositories or literatures requires careful consideration as the eventual null bfd is representative of a scenario subject to the assumptions and conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
the accumulating wealth of molecular signatures in publications and public repositories for a wide range of disease types and experimental conditions is a useful resource for any researcher. importantly, it allows projection of a newly-derived gss onto published, defined and well-annotated gsss and subsequently identifies individual gids that are also independently associated with another feature. our randomized sampling approach allows the generation of a null background frequency distribution, which could be used to identify a preliminary co-occurrence threshold and subsequently select subsets of the signature genes as statistically unique or significantly associated with another molecular feature. we have successfully applied our method to expression microarray and clinical data. in particular, our results suggest that there is a stronger association of the igf <dig> signature genes with  <dig> bc rgsss, than for the obesity-associated signature. also, both sn and sc gids could be considered as perspective prognostic biomarkers of bcs. our method identifies many dozen genes which have not been considered in context of their functional association of obesity and bc. in particular, our analysis suggests a close association of many genes expressed in mapk pathways with obesity, igf <dig> and bc pathways. we propose that the method reported in this study could also be applicable and of interest to researchers in other fields including but not limited to social science, epidemiology, linguistics, forensic analysis and internet networks.
