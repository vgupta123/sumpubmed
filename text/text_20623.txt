BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that can cause a number of types of infections and inflammations, ranging from superficial skin infections to life-threatening toxic shock syndrome, septicemia, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis  <cit> . s. aureus has developed many defense mechanisms to protect itself from the human immune system and antibiotic treatment. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  has been spread worldwide, rendering the entire β-lactam class of antibiotics ineffective  <cit> . so far, vancomycin has been the most reliable therapeutic agent against infections caused by mrsa. vancomycin binds to d-alanyl-d-alanine residues of the murein monomer to interfere the synthesis of bacterial cell wall  <cit> . the cell wall is very important for s. aureus to maintain an osmotic gradient, and a thickened cell wall is often related to increased resistance to vancomycin  <cit> . in addition to the cell wall, s. aureus is encapsulated by capsular polysaccharides, which can protect cells from phagocytosis  <cit> .

two-component systems  act as a basic stimulus–response to allow organisms to sense and respond to changes in many different environmental conditions. typical tcss have two components, a histidine protein kinase and a response regulator. the kinase senses the environmental stimuli, autophosphorylates at a histidine residue, and transfers the phosphoryl to an aspartate residue in the response regulator. then the regulator is active to regulate downstream genes  <cit> . bioinformatics analysis indicates that s. aureus harbors  <dig> conservative tcss. in many cases, virulence gene expression is controlled by tcss such as the well-studied agrac  <cit>  and saesr  <cit> . in addition to virulence control, the tcss are involved in the regulation of biofilm formation  <cit> , autolysis  <cit> , heme toxin resistance  <cit> , cell wall synthesis  <cit> , capsular polysaccharide synthesis  <cit> , and antibiotic resistance  <cit> . in s. aureus, walkr is a well-known tcs for its role in controlling cell wall metabolism and cell survival  <cit> . recently, walkr has been reported to be involved in vancomycin resistance  <cit> . by introducing a point mutation of walk, s. aureus exhibited reduced susceptibility to vancomycin  <cit> . the tcs vrasr, can positively modulate cell wall biosynthesis and increase resistance to vancomycin  <cit> . another tcs, grasr, can modulate vancomycin resistance partly by regulating an adjacent abc transporter, vrafg  <cit> .

although most tcss in s. aureus have been well studied, the function of a few tcss remains elusive or only partially explained. airsr  was first reported to be an essential tcs  <cit>  and was involved in the regulation of the nitrate respiratory pathway  <cit> . subsequently, airsr was described as an oxygen sensing and redox-signaling regulator  <cit> . a recent study demonstrated that airsr can regulate the lac and opucabcd operons  <cit> . it appears that more work is needed to address the function of this tcs. in this study, we deleted airsr in s. aureus nctc <dig> and observed that approximately  <dig> cell wall metabolism-associated genes were down-regulated in the airsr mutant in our microarray result. after further investigation of cell wall-related phenotypes, we found that inactivation of airsr led to reduced autolysis rates and reduced viability in sub-inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin. real-time reverse-transcription  pcr verified the down-regulation of several cell wall-related genes and the autolysin lytm. electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that airr can directly bind to the promoter regions of cap, ddl, pbp <dig>  and lytm, indicating that airsr is directly involved in cell wall biosynthesis and turnover processes and, subsequently, vancomycin susceptibility.

purification of airr and airs
6-his-tagged airr was cloned and purified using standard procedures. the full-length airr orf was amplified by pcr with the e-airr-f and e-airr-r primers from s. aureus nctc <dig> genomic dna, cloned into the expression vector pet28a  , and transformed into e. coli bl <dig> . the transformant was grown in lb at 37°c to an od <dig> of  <dig>  and induced with  <dig>  mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  at 37°c for an additional three hours. the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in a lysis buffer . the 6-his-tagged airr protein was purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose solution  following the manufacturer’s recommendation. the bound protein was eluted with an elution buffer . the imidazole in the eluent was removed using a centrifuge biomax- <dig> column , and the airr protein solution was supplemented with 30% glycerol and stored at −80°c until use.

we also used airs for airr phosphorylation in vitro. briefly, 10 μl phosphorylation buffer containing 2 μm airs and 10 mm atp was used to initiate the autophosphorylation of airs. after incubation at 25°c for 5 min, 10 μm airr was added and the incubation was continued for another 10 min  <cit> .

RESULTS
transcriptional profile of the airsr mutated strain
to investigate the function of airsr, we performed a cdna microarray analysis using total rna from the exponential growth stage. the microarray results indicated that approximately  <dig> genes were up-regulated  and  <dig> genes were down-regulated . we used clusters of orthologous groups of proteins  of ncbi for protein function prediction. the expression levels of  <dig> cell wall metabolism-related genes were altered in the airsr mutant. the majority of these genes were down-regulated, including members of the capsular polysaccharide synthesis operon , penicillin-binding protein  <dig> , and other enzymes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of murein sacculus and peptidoglycan. the detailed results are listed in table  <dig>  these data suggest that airsr plays an important role in cell wall biosynthesis.

a “-” indicates down-regulated in the airsr mutant.

autolysis rate induced by triton x-100
to test whether cell wall biosynthesis was affected, we examined triton x-100-induced autolytic activity. the airsr mutant exhibited decreased autolysis rates compared with the wild-type strain. this phenomenon was restored by introducing a plasmid that contained the airsr operon , suggesting that cell wall turnover was affected by the inactivation of airsr.

viability of the airsr mutant in the presence of vancomycin
since vancomycin is an important antibiotic that targets s. aureus cell wall, we tested the viability of s. aureus in mh agar plates with vancomycin. the wild-type and the airsr mutant were able to grow at a maximum concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml vancomycin, whereas the airsr mutant formed significantly fewer colonies . we also tested cell growth in mh broth containing various concentrations of vancomycin. the cells were incubated in mh broth at an inoculum of  <dig> × 107 cfu/ml, with constant shaking at 37°c. no significant difference was observed when cells grew in mh broth without vancomycin. the airsr mutant exhibited a clear growth defect compared to the wild-type in the medium containing  <dig>  μg/ml vancomycin . taken together, these results indicate that the airsr inactivation reduced the ability of the bacteria to survive in the presence of vancomycin.

transcriptional analysis using real-time rt pcr
to verify the microarray results, mrna levels from different growth stages were examined using real-time rt pcr. the mrna levels of certain cell wall-related genes, including cap5b, cap5d, taga, saouhsc_ <dig>  pbp <dig>  murd, ftsq, and ddl, were significantly reduced . these results were in accordance with the microarray results. we also investigated the transcriptional levels of various peptidoglycan hydrolase-coding genes. only lytm was down-regulated, as indicated by real-time pcr , while atl sle <dig> and lytn showed no obvious changes in expression .

when we used cells collected from oxygen depletion conditions for real-time rt pcr, we found that only three genes  showed the same down-regulation as under aerobic conditions . this may suggest that airsr needs oxygen to exert its regulation ability.

we also compared the transcriptional level of several genes from the real-time rt pcr result and the microarray data, and found a positive correlation between the two techniques .

the binding of airr to the target genes
we cloned and purified a his-tagged airr to perform gel shift assays. dna probes containing the putative promoters of several target genes were amplified. a clearly shifted band of dna was visible after incubation of airr with dna probes containing the cap promoter . the intensity of the shifted band increased as the amount of airr was higher. this shifted band disappeared in the presence of an approximately 50-fold excess of unlabeled cap promoter dna but not in the presence of 50-fold excess of an unlabeled coding sequence dna of pta. these data suggest that airr can specifically bind to the cap promoter region.

similar assays were performed using dna fragments of the promoter region of ddl and pbp <dig>  two other genes that encode cell wall biosynthesis-related proteins. similar promoter dna band shift patterns were observed with the ddl and pbp <dig> promoters , suggesting that airr can bind to these promoters. the promoter region of lytm was amplified and used as a gel shift probe. the result indicated that airr can specifically bind to the lytm promoter .

to test the effect of phosphorylation of airr, same amount of airr or airr-p obtained from both lithium potassium acetyl phosphate and airs were used for emsa of cap promoter. the shift band from different proteins did not show obvious difference , which is consistent with the observation by another group  <cit> .

discussion
our study shows a direct connection between cell wall metabolism and airsr. more than  <dig> genes that are related to cell wall metabolism were down-regulated in the airsr mutant, as shown by microarray analysis. real-time rt pcr experiments confirmed the transcript level changes of several genes . real-time rt pcr indicated that the transcription of a major autolysin, lytm, was down-regulated in the airsr mutant. this result is consistent with the observation of a decreased autolysis rates induced by triton x- <dig> in the airsr mutant. the gel-shift assays indicated that airr can directly bind to the promoter regions of cap, ddl, pbp <dig>  and lytm. these results suggest that airsr enhances cell wall synthesis and degradation.

we performed the phylogenetic footprinting using promoter sequences from orthologous target genes in staphylococci. analysis of these sequences using clustal multiple sequence alignment and meme  <cit>  suggests that a motif “aaatnnaaaatnnnntt” may represent the binding sequence of airr . in our further study, we will use footprinting to identify the exact binding sequence and motif and then search genome wide for more potential targets.

cell wall synthesis is crucial for bacterial division and growth, and it is a very important target of antibiotics, such as penicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin. with the increase in the number of mrsa strains, vancomycin has become the first choice to treat staphylococcal infections. the use of vancomycin has led to the emergence of vancomycin-intermediate staphylococcus aureus . typically, visa exhibits thick cell walls and reduced autolysis rates. our study demonstrated that the airsr mutation exhibited both reduced viability in vancomycin and attenuated autolysis. we speculated that, the affected expression of cell wall metabolism-related genes owing to the airsr mutation caused the reduction in cell viability due to vancomycin. attenuated autolysis may be a compensatory mechanism for the affected cell wall synthesis. the reduction of viability in the presence of vancomycin and the attenuation of autolysis are two independent outcomes of the airsr mutation.

one other research group previously designated airsr as yhcsr and reported that it was an essential tcs  <cit> . however, there are reports of an airsr mutation in several strains including newman  <cit> , mw <dig>  <cit> , a clinically isolated strain  <dig>  <cit> , and nctc <dig>  indicating that airsr is unlikely to be essential in all strain backgrounds. early research on airsr reported that this tcs is involved in the regulation of the nitrate respiratory pathway  <cit>  or in the direct regulation of the lac and opucabcd operons  <cit> . our microarray results indicated the down-regulation of the nar and nre operons in the airsr mutant, which is consistent with the report that airsr can positively regulate the nitrate respiratory pathway  <cit> . our microarray data, however, did not show that airsr can regulate lac or opuc operons . another group that first named this tcs airsr described airsr as an oxygen sensing and redox-signaling regulator. though they stated that airs contains a fe-s-cluster essential for oxygen sensing and is only active in the presence of oxygen in vitro, they found that the airr mutant only affects gene expression under anaerobic conditions in strain newman  <cit> . in contrast, our results showed that the expression of cell wall metabolism-related genes was not changed under anaerobic conditions , but only under aerobic conditions . after further comparison of their microarray data with ours, we found that, cap operon, pbp <dig>  and lytm were under negative control of airr in their strain but positive control in our strain; saesr, agr, and rnaiii were under negative control in their strain but not changed in our strain; spa and hlgc are under positive control of airr in both strains . the discrepancy may suggest that the regulatory activity of airr is strain specific. why airsr acts differently in different strains is still not clear. our speculation is that inactivation of sigma b in nctc <dig> may contribute to the different activity of airsr in nctc <dig> and newman. but this speculation needs further study.

walkr is an important tcs that positively controls cell wall biosynthesis and turnover, including directly controlling lytm  <cit> . alterations in the expression of walkr as well as walkr mutations at amino acid sequence can lead to a change in susceptibility to vancomycin  <cit> . airsr and walkr exhibit similar functions. our microarray data indicate that the walkr expression level is unchanged in the airsr mutant, and there is no report so far that walkr regulates airsr, suggesting that the two tcss may regulate cell wall biosynthesis independently.

CONCLUSIONS
the airsr mutant exhibited reduced autolysis and down-regulation in many cell wall metabolism-related genes in s. aureus nctc <dig>  and airr can directly bind to the promoter region of some of these cell wall metabolism genes. these findings demonstrate that airsr is a positive regulator in cell wall biosynthesis and turnover in s. aureus nctc <dig>  the airsr mutant exhibited reduced viability in the presence of vancomycin, suggesting that airsr could be a new target for controlling s. aureus infection.
