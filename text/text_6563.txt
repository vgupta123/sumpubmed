BACKGROUND
digitalis purpurea l.  is an herbaceous biennial flowering plant species. it is native to europe and has been widely introduced into other parts of the world. now, this plant becomes naturalized in many countries, such as china, canada, usa, and new zealand  <cit> . d. purpurea is known for its campanulate flowers produced on a tall spike. the flower color varies from purple to pink, yellow or white. because of the showy flowers, d. purpurea has an ornamental value and is cultivated world widely. however, this plant is highly poisonous to humans and may be fatal if ingested, so it is suggested to be banished from the table  <cit> . although d. purpurea is toxic, it has a high medical value in the therapy of congestive heart failure, particularly arrhythmia for over  <dig> years  <cit> . many patients benefited from the use of this plant and its extracts. the main active compounds of d. purpurea are cardiac glycosides , which are a group of cardio-active agents with the ability to inhibit na+/k+-atpase and have been proved to be the most effective drugs to treat heart failure during the past two centuries  <cit> . d. purpurea is also a potential source of anti-tumor drugs because of its high cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines  <cit> . the discovery of cardio-active agents in d. purpurea by the 18th century scottish physician william withering is thought to help launching the development of modern pharmacology and the pharmaceutical industry, further suggesting the importance of d. purpurea to medicine  <cit> .

d. purpurea tolerates many environmental stresses, such as cold, drought, heat, flooding, full sun and poor soil, although it prefers rich and well-drained acidic soils and half shade and moist environments. this plant can survive in most temperate climates of the world, including the cold temperate in alaska of the united states and south-western norway and the hot and drought conditions in some areas of africa  <cit> . being a biennial plant, d. purpurea is able to withstand the winter cold and the summer drought  <cit> . significant damage to d. purpurea leaves were happened only at -12°c or below and the threshold for buds and roots was as low as -15°c and -18°c, respectively  <cit> . thus, d. purpurea seems to be an ideal species for studying plant responses to drought and cold stresses.

although d. purpurea exhibits significance in ornament, medicine and biological study, little has been done about genes involved in the growth and development of this plant species. no est sequences are available and only  <dig> nucleotide records are found for d. purpurea in the ncbi nucleotide database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/. the major efforts to study the molecular aspects of d. purpurea were focused on the purification and characterization of malonyl-coenzyme a: 21-hydroxypregnane 21-o-malonyltransferase  and the identification of genes encoding progesterone 5β-reductase  and Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase , which are involved in the biosynthesis of cardiac glycosides  <cit> .

non-protein-coding rnas , also known as noncoding rnas , are transcripts that have neither experimental nor evolutionary evidence for an open reading frame encoding a functional protein  <cit> . they are produced in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes and represent the vast majority of all transcripts in a cell as demonstrated by genomic tiling arrays, whole transcriptome analysis, reverse transcription-rcr  and computational prediction  <cit> . in human, more than 90% of the total genome sequence is likely to be transcribed, but only about  <dig> % of the genome codes for proteins, suggesting the abundance of human npcrna species  <cit> . the high percentage of transcription in non-protein-coding regions was also reported for other eukaryotes, such as mouse, yeast and drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . now, npcrna is a research hotspot of rna biology and the number of identified npcrnas is increasing rapidly.

results from gene expression profiling and functional analysis strongly suggested that most of the npcrnas could be biologically meaningful rather than merely transcriptional "noise"  <cit> . based on the expression profiles and predicted functions, npcrnas can be classified into two groups, including housekeeping npcrnas and regulatory npcrnas  <cit> . housekeeping npcrnas are usually expressed constitutively and include rrnas, trnas, snrnas and snornas, whereas regulatory npcrnas are differentially expressed and developmentally regulated and can be subdivided into short regulatory npcrnas , such as micrornas  and small interfering rnas , and large regulatory npcrnas  that may or may not be polyadenylated. a subset of lncrnas, which can undergo splicing and are capped and polyadenylated as conventional mrnas, are called mrna-like npcrnas   <cit> .

recently, srnas, particularly mirnas, have been intensely studied  <cit> . the number of identified mirnas has reached to  <dig> according to the most recent release of mirbase . it includes  <dig> mirnas from plants,  <dig> from viruses, and more than  <dig>  from animals. in plants, mirnas play crucial roles in organ development and defense responses by targeting other rna molecules for cleavage, or, in a few cases, for translational repression  <cit> . lncrnas are much less studied as compared with mrnas and srnas and represent a major unexplored transcript species  <cit> . so far, only a small number of lncrnas have been functionally characterized  <cit> . the known roles of lncrnas in animals include transcriptional regulation, epigenetic gene regulation, and disease response  <cit> . studies of plant lncrnas were mainly concentrated on systematic searches of mlncrnas in arabidopsis thaliana, wheat, and medicago truncatula  <cit> . only few were identified in other plant species  <cit> . several of the identified plant mlncrnas, including arabidopsis atips1/at <dig> and coldair, cucumis sativus csm <dig>  zea mays zm <dig> and m. truncatula enod <dig>  were functionally characterized. the results suggested important regulatory roles of plant mlncrnas in phosphate deprivation response, vernalization response, pollen development, gender-biased expression, and nodulation  <cit> . functions of the other plant mlncrnas are largely unknown.

in this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of d. purpurea transcriptome that had never been explored. we obtained a high-quality unigene set and determined conserved and non-conserved protein-coding genes, including candidates for about 75% of the total cardiac glycoside biosynthesis-associated gene families in d. purpurea. we identified a large number of mlncrna candidates and  <dig> microrna-producing unigenes and predicted  <dig> microrna targets. using a comprehensive approach, we revealed some important characteristics of mlncrnas and took efforts to identify mlncrna-regulated protein-coding genes. these results enhance our knowledge of cardiac glycoside biosynthesis and provide useful information for understanding the function of mlncrnas.

RESULTS
high-throughput sequencing and assembly of d. purpurea transcriptome
in order to explore the transcriptome of d. purpurea, we constructed a cdna library of the leaves of one-year-old plants and sequenced it using the  <dig> ultra-high-throughput pyrosequencing platform, the genome sequencer flx system. we obtained a total of  <dig> high-quality reads  with an average length of  <dig> bases. pre-processing and de novo assembly using the gs de novo assembler software clustered  <dig> reads  into  <dig> contigs  and left  <dig> singletons, yielding a total of  <dig> unigenes. original reads of contigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average  <dig>  and lengths ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp with an average  <dig> bp. the size distribution showed that most of contigs ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp and the percentage of contigs no less than  <dig> bp was 76% . these data suggested that most of the pyrosequencing data had been successfully assembled into relatively long contigs.

functional annotation and gene ontology analysis
functional annotation of unigenes was carried out by sequence similarity searches against the ncbi non-redundant  protein database using the basic local alignment search tool   <cit> . we applied a generous e-value cutoff of 10- <dig> to the blast homolog recognition.  <dig>  of total unigenes were annotated according to the proposed function of the best match for each unigene in the nr protein database. these annotated unigenes were protein-coding genes conserved in other species. the remaining  <dig> unigenes , which did not show significant similarity to any sequences in the nr protein database, could be npcrnas, utr regions of known protein-coding genes, or novel protein-coding transcripts.

the d. purpurea unigenes were further analyzed and categorized using the gene ontology , which had been widely used to standardize the representation of gene and gene product attributes across species and to describe gene products in terms of their associated biological processes, cellular locations and molecular functions in a species-independent manner  <cit> . go analysis annotated a total of  <dig> unigenes and assigned one or more go terms to each of them . the category of molecular function, which included  <dig> unigenes, was the largest, followed by the biological process category  and the cellular location category . go assignments of  <dig> subcategories of the three categories were shown in figure  <dig>  metabolic process, protein binding, cellular process and catalytic activity were the largest four subcategories.

identification of protein-coding genes involved in cardiac glycoside biosynthesis
d. purpurea is a useful medicinal plant species in heart failure treatment  <cit> . isolation and characterization of genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, such as cardiac glycosides, is particularly valuable. however, little research had been done on this area. with the aim of identifying cardiac glycoside biosynthesis-associated genes on a transcriptome-wide scale, we first analyzed the  <dig> d. purpurea unigenes by sequence similarity searches against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database  and then searched for unigenes associated with metabolic pathways  <cit> . using an e-value cutoff of 10- <dig>  we computationally annotated  <dig> unigenes , of which  <dig> were assigned to the kegg metabolic pathway category, suggesting a number of unigenes associated with metabolic pathways of d. purpurea were obtained. within the metabolic pathway category, unigenes were separated into  <dig> subcategories .

further analysis of unigene assignment in the subcategories showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> unigenes each were classified to a subcategory, while the other  <dig> each were assigned to two or more subcategories. among the  <dig> subcategories of metabolic pathway, carbohydrate metabolism was assigned the largest amount of unigenes , followed by amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and the others . the biosynthesis of steroids and terpenoids were well-represented by unigenes in the subcategories of lipid metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, allowing the effective identification of cardiac glycoside biosynthesis-related genes in d. purpurea .

digitalis cardiac glycosides are a class of plant secondary metabolites consisting of a steroid nucleus and a sugar side chain varied in length  <cit> . the putative biosynthetic pathway of plant cardiac glycosides roughly comprises terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis and cardenolide biosynthesis three stages, involving about  <dig> gene families, of which only a few had been characterized in d. purpurea. examination of unigenes assigned to the subcategories of lipid metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites allowed us to identify a total of  <dig> unigenes that could be associated with the biosynthesis of terpenoid backbone, steroids and cardenolides . these unigenes were grouped into  <dig> gene families, representing about 75% of the total cardiac glycoside biosynthesis-associated gene families.

among the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig> assembled from  <dig> original  <dig> reads were involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid backbone, and represented  <dig> of the  <dig> terpenoid backbone biosynthesis-associated gene families . twenty unigenes assembled from  <dig> original  <dig> reads were identified to represent  <dig> of the  <dig> putative steroid biosynthesis-associated gene families, suggesting genes involved in the steroid biosynthesis were also well-represented in the unigene set .

different from that involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid backbone and steroids, genes associated with cardenolide biosynthesis were not well-represented. the putative pathway of cardenolide biosynthesis involved at least  <dig> gene families, of which only  <dig> were represented by unigenes. it includes those encoding Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases , progesterone 5β-reductases , mono-oxygenases, cardenolide 16'-o-glucohydrolases , and glycosyltransferases  . 3β-hsd and 5β-por and mono-oxygenase genes are involved in the initial steps of cardenolide biosynthesis toward cardenolide genin formation, gt genes are responsible for addition of sugars to the genins, whereas cgh is involved in the degradation of primary cardiac glycosides. the gene families of mono-oxygenases and gts are usually super-large in plants and play crucial roles in various cellular and metabolic processes. consistently, in the  <dig> est database, mono-oxygenases were represented by  <dig> unigenes assembled from  <dig> original  <dig> reads, while gts were represented by  <dig> unigenes from  <dig> reads. the exact mono-oxygenase and gt genes involved in cardenolide biosynthesis remained to elucidate. it is worthy to note that the unigene encoding cgh was listed among the  <dig> most abundant unigenes . low representativeness of unigenes for cardenolide biosynthesis-associated gene families in our  <dig> est database and high expression of the gene involved in primary cardiac glycoside hydrolysis were consistent with overall low cardiac glycoside content in d. purpurea leaves, although relative to other organs leaves have the highest content of cardiac glycosides  <cit> . these data greatly enhanced our knowledge of digitalis cardiac glycoside biosynthesis and provided candidate genes for improving the production of active medicinal compounds in d. purpurea through genetic engineering.

transcriptome-wide identification of d. purpurea mlncrna candidates
although npcrna had been found in various organisms, systematically searches of plant mlncrnas were carried out only in a. thaliana, wheat and m. truncatula  <cit> . in d. purpurea, among the  <dig> unigenes analyzed,  <dig>  could be novel protein-coding transcripts or npcrnas because they did not show significant similarity to any sequences in the nr protein database. among the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig>  which were not further analyzed, were less than  <dig> bp in length. the other  <dig> with sizes at least  <dig> bp were subjected to detailed characterization using the pipeline summarized in figure  <dig> 

the pipeline we used is similar to those reported previously for systematic screens of mlncrnas from the est databases of arabidopsis  <cit> , medicago  <cit> , sus scrofa  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , and human  <cit> . a cutoff of  <dig> amino acids was applied in this study to distinguish npcrnas from protein-coding transcripts as suggested by rymarquis et al . the results showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> unigenes with sizes at least  <dig> bp had the potential to encode proteins, while the other  <dig> unigenes were npcrna candidates. it includes  <dig> mlncrnas and  <dig> housekeeping npcrnas  . low number of non-polyadenylated trna and snornas are consistent with our experimental strategy to select polyadenylated rnas for library construction. being consistent with the size distribution of contigs, most of the identified mlncrna candidates have sizes ranged between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp . the others include  <dig> with 600- <dig> bp in length and  <dig> over  <dig> bp . the long ones, such as those with sizes over  <dig> bp, are very likely to be authentic mlncrnas, whereas we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the short ones are utrs of protein coding genes or contain partial orfs and utrs of protein coding genes. further experimental cloning of full-length transcripts may help verify those short mlncrna candidates. these results suggest the existence of a large number of mlncrnas in d. purpurea.

identification of  <dig> d. purpurea micrornas
micrornas  are a class of small noncoding rnas derived from long primary mirnas and play crucial roles in organ development and defense responses  <cit> . many mirnas are deeply conserved across species boundaries. it allows us to identify d. purpurea mirnas by computational search of our unigene set based on the conservation of mirna sequences and the secondary structure of unigenes  <cit> . we, therefore, searched the unigene set for sequences similar to the mirnas included in the most recent release of mirbase   <cit>  using the blastn program  <cit> , and then performed mfold analysis of hairpin structures for those unigenes with regions no more than three mismatches to known mirnas  <cit> . as a result, we identified a total of  <dig> mirna-producing unigenes, which counted for  <dig> % of total d. purpurea unigenes . except fxat9o005f5r <dig>  which is  <dig> bp in length, the other  <dig> mirna-producing unigenes are mlncrnas with sizes at least  <dig> bp. it includes jo <dig> , one of the mlncrnas with sizes over  <dig> bp . based on the predicted mirna sequences, these unigenes were classified into eight families, of which four, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were each represented by a single member, while the others, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  each had two or three members identified . in absence of a small rna database for d. purpurea, we are not able to reveal those mlncrnas that produce species-specific mirnas, but even so, the ratio  of mirna-producing unigenes to total d. purpurea transcripts is much higher than the ratios  reported previously for other plant species, suggesting the importance of mirnas in d. purpurea plants  <cit> .

identification of  <dig> d. purpurea mirna targets
the regulatory role of plant mirnas was achieved mainly through targeting other rna molecules for cleavage  <cit> . perfect or near-perfect complementarities were found between plant mirnas and their targets, allowing an effective prediction of target sequences through computation  <cit> . a useful web server for prediction of plant mirna targets, known as psrnatarget, has been developed  <cit> . it searches potential mirna targets using an improved iterative parallel smith-waterman algorithm and a weighted scoring schema  <cit> . penalty scores were calculated for mismatched patterns in the mirna:mrna duplexes within a 20-base sequence window. using psrnatarget and setting the penalty score cutoff threshold 0- <dig>  we identified a total of  <dig> targets from our unigene set for seven d. purpurea mirna families, which are mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> . the number of targets for each mirna families range between one and seven. no targets were predicted for mir <dig>  indicating a very low expression level of mir <dig> targets in d. purpurea leaves.

as expected, some of the predicted targets are deeply conserved among various plant species. it includes two auxin response factor  genes regulated by mir <dig>  an apetala <dig>  gene targeted by mir <dig>  and a growth-regulating factor  gene cleaved by mir <dig> . all of them encode transcription factors that are important to plant development, suggesting the conserved roles of mirnas in different plant species. twenty one of the  <dig> predicted targets appear to be not conserved targets of mirnas. it is consistent with the previous results showing species-specific targets for many conserved mirnas in other plant species, such as populus trichocarpa and pinus taeda  <cit> . among the twenty one targets, twelve are involved in metabolism, rna process, transcriptional regulation and signal transduction, while the other nine are function-unknown, indicating possible new roles of mirnas in d. purpurea . computational comparison of gene functions showed that many of these species-specific targets could be important in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. for instance, the glyoxalase i gene targeted by mir <dig> has 75% identity with a member of arabidopsis calmodulin-binding proteins, at1g <dig>  which is involved in plant responses to phytoprostane treatment  <cit> . the two kh domain-containing proteins regulated by mir <dig> show at least 75% identity with at5g <dig> that is involved in light responses in arabidopsis plants growing at low temperature  <cit> . the dead box atp-dependent rna helicase gene targted by mir <dig> is a member of a large gene family involved in defense responses against pathogen infection and various abiotic stresses  <cit> . the heat shock protein encoded by contig <dig>  a predicted target of mir <dig>  shows 91% identity to arabidopsis hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> that are involved in various biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . these results suggested the roles of mirnas in the development and defense responses of d. purpurea plants. further experimental validation of the predicted mirna targets may help add new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of mirnas in d. purpurea.

indentification of mlncrna families based on sequence homology
among the  <dig> d. purpurea mlncrna candidates with sizes at least  <dig> bp,  <dig> produce mirnas , while functions of the other  <dig> mlncrnas are poorly understood. as a first step toward elucidating the roles of these mlncrnas, we searched sequence homology among them using blastn  <cit> . by applying an e-value cutoff of 10- <dig> to the homolog recognition, we revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> mlncrnas could be grouped into  <dig> families . number of members for these mlncrna families is between  <dig> and  <dig>  the existence of mlncrna families with multiple members could be a first indication that they actually are important in d. purpurea. no homologs were found for the other  <dig> mlncrnas, indicating that most of the mlncrnas could be single copy. these results provide a basis for further demonstrating mlncrna functions.

conservation of d. purpurea mlncrnas
the conservation of mlncrnas was analyzed by searching d. purpurea mlncrna candidates against the noncode database of known npcrnas using the blastn program  <cit> . an e-value cutoff of 10- <dig> was applied. among the  <dig> non-microrna-producing mlncrna candidates, only eight were found to be conserved . it suggests the majority of d. purpurea mlncrnas are species-specific. the low degree of evolutionary constraint of mlncrnas was also found in other plant species including m. truncatula, arabidopsis, wheat, and animals such as drosophila and mouse, indicating low conservation of mlncrnas is a common phenomenon in organisms  <cit> . among the eight conserved mlncrnas, two are homologues of gut <dig>  an npcrna probably involved in hormone response in nicotiana tabacum and arabidopsis  <cit> . functions of the other six conserved mlncrnas are currently unknown.

tissue-specific expression of mlncrnas in d. purpurea
except mir408-producing npcr <dig> , expression patterns of the other  <dig> mlncrnas with sizes over  <dig> bp were analyzed in one-year-old, greenhouse grown d. purpurea plants by quantitative real-time rt-pcr . ubiquitin gene was selected as a reference since it showed stable expression in the d. purpurea tissues analyzed compared with actin and 18s rrna   <cit> . among the  <dig> mlncrnas analyzed, two, including mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig>  were undetected, indicating low levels in the tissues analyzed. the other  <dig> were found to be expressed in at least one tissue . mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig> are abundant in leaves, while mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig> are expressed mainly in roots. the levels of mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig> are higher in leaves and roots than stems and flowers, while mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig> exhibit high expression in leaves and stems compared with that in flowers and roots. differential expression was also found for the other mlncrnas . it suggests the level of mlncrnas is developmentally regulated and indicates the importance of mlncrnas in d. purpurea growth and development.

identification of  <dig> cold- and  <dig> dehydration-responsive mlncrnas
d. purpurea plants tolerate various environmental stresses  <cit> . to address whether mlncrnas are involved in plant response to cold and dehydration stresses, we analyzed the levels of  <dig> non-mirna-producing mlncrnas with sizes over  <dig> bp in d. purpurea plantlets treated with cold and dehydration for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> hours and compared them with the levels in untreated plantlets. we were able to detect  <dig> mlncrnas in plantlets, except mlncr <dig>  an mlncrna detected in leaves, stems and flowers of one-year old mature plants, and mlncr <dig>  which was also undetected in the analyzed tissues of mature plants . d. purpurea mlncr <dig> exhibited opposite expression patterns with mlncr <dig>  which expressed in plantlets but not in the analyzed tissues of one-year-old plants. it suggests that the expression of both mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig> is developmentally regulated, while their biological functions are distinct. d. purpurea mlncr <dig> appears to play a temporary role in d. purpurea because it is undetected in all of the tissues analyzed.

among the  <dig> mlncrnas expressed in plantlets,  <dig> and  <dig> showed more than 2-fold changes between at least two time-points in plantlets treated with cold and dehydration, respectively, and thus was considered as cold- or dehydration-responsive mlncrnas . it includes  <dig> responsive to dehydration only and  <dig> responsive to cold and dehydration, suggesting all of the mlncrnas analyzed are stress-responsive and the majority is not only cold-responsive but also dehydration-responsive. it demonstrates the importance of mlncrnas in stress responses and indicates the existence of a crosstalk among mlncrnas in response to cold and dehydration stresses. the results of almost all analyzed mlncrnas to be cold- and/or dehydration-responsive indicate that the plant materials were probably exposed to environmental stresses before being used for est library construction.

based on the expression patterns in response to cold stress, mlncrnas can be roughly categorized into three major types . type a mlncrnas, including mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig>  showed less than 2-fold changes between any two time-points. these mlncrnas appears to be not responsive to cold. type b, such as mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig>  exhibited an immediate decrease after treatment for  <dig> hour. the decrease continued for at least  <dig> hours and then some of them, such as mlncr <dig>  showed a trend of recovering to the level in untreated tissues. by contrast, type c mlncrnas, accounting for more than 80% or  <dig> of the total  <dig> mlncrnas, showed a rapid increase after treatment. the highest level was reached, for most type c mlncrnas, at  <dig> h after stress, or in a few cases, at  <dig>  or  <dig> hours . after reaching to a maximum, the mlncrna levels quickly declined to near, or in most cases, far below the levels in untreated tissues. rapid changes of expression level indicate the importance of type b and type c mlncrnas in cold-stress response, although the underlying biological functions can be distinct between type b and type c mlncrnas.

similarly, based on the expression patterns in response to dehydration stress, mlncrnas can also be roughly classified into  <dig> groups . the level of group i mlncrnas, such as mlncr <dig>  kept constant within the first  <dig> hours of dehydration stress and then increased at  <dig> hours, showing a relatively slow response. group ii and group iii mlncrnas showed much quicker responses to dehydration stress. the expression pattern of group ii mlncrnas in response to dehydration is similar to type b mlncrnas in response to cold stress, exhibiting a rapid decrease at  <dig> hour of stress . except mlncr <dig>  which showed an increase at  <dig> hours, down-regulation of most group ii mlncrnas lasted for at least  <dig> hours. group ii, consisting of  <dig> mlncrnas, is much larger than type b which includes only two, although group ii and type b mlncrnas exhibited similar expression patterns in response to dehydration and cold stress, respectively. group iii consists of  <dig> mlncrnas, including mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig>  expression of mlncrnas in this group was induced at  <dig> hour of stress and then immediately down-regulated to far below the level in untreated tissues. it is similar to the pattern of type c mlncrnas in response to cold stress . the similarity of mlncrna expression patterns in response to cold and dehydration suggests that the cold signaling network and the dehydration signaling network are probably overlapped.

identification of  <dig> protein-coding genes with regions significantly homologous or complementary to  <dig> mlncrnas
genes with conserved sequences usually show structural, functional or evolutionary relationships. in order to elucidate the relationship between mlncrnas and protein-coding genes in d. purpurea, we searched our unigene set for protein-coding genes with regions significantly homologous or complementary to mlncrnas using blastn and applying a generous e-value cutoff of 10- <dig> to the blast homolog recognition  <cit> . a total of  <dig> protein-coding genes were identified . they showed sequence similarity to  <dig> mlncrnas in coding sequences , untranslated regions  or cds-utr junctions. among the  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> each had only one corresponding mlncrnas, while the others each had 2- <dig> hits, implying protein-coding genes can be related to one or several mlncrnas. similarly, among the  <dig> mlncrnas,  <dig> each showed sequence similarity to 2- <dig> protein-coding genes, indicating some mlncrnas are related to multiple protein-coding genes. the results demonstrate the complex relationship between mlncrnas and protein-coding genes in d. purpurea. among the  <dig> protein-coding genes, many encode known proteins involved in metabolism, signal transduction, gene regulation, stress response, protein folding and degradation, or nucleic acid and chromatin modification, indicating the importance of mlncrnas in the growth and development of d. purpurea plants .

expression analysis of  <dig> protein-coding genes homologous or complementary to mlncrnas
four mlncrna/protein-coding gene pairs were selected for further analysis . it includes mlncr <dig> /vacuolar h+-atp synthase subunit e gene , mlncr <dig> /snf1-related protein kinase gene , mlncr <dig> /4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase gene , and mlncr <dig> /solanesyl diphosphate synthase gene . we first determined the transcriptional direction of protein-coding genes based on the direction of annotated proteins, and then experimentally identified the transcriptional direction of mlncrnas using 3' race. results show that mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig> have the same transcriptional direction as their corresponding protein-coding genes in the conserved regions, suggesting these mlncrnas are homologous to the corresponding protein-coding genes. among them, mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig> share homologous sequences with the 5' utr of vha-e and the 3' utr of hds, respectively, while mlncr <dig> has a region highly similar to the cds of snrk. in contrast, mlncr <dig> appears to be complementary to the 5' utr of sps gene .

we next analyzed the expression patterns of vha-e, snrk, hds and sps in response to cold and dehydration stresses and compared them with the corresponding mlncrnas . in general, the expression of vha-e, snrk and hds showed a positive correlation with the homologous mlncrnas, mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig>  respectively, although variation was found at very early stage after treatment, such as  <dig> hour. the most conspicuous positive correlation of expression was found at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours of stress. it suggests the existence of a close relationship between protein-coding genes and the homologous mlncrnas and indicates that some protein-coding genes can be regulated by mlncrnas based on the sense:sense interaction through a currently unknown mechanism or the protein-coding genes and mlncrnas may be regulated by the same cis/trans factors. in contrast, the expression of sps gene showed a negative correlation with mlncr <dig> after  <dig> hours of stress, being most noticeable in plantlets treated with cold stress . it indicates the presence of sense:antisense interaction between protein-coding genes and the complementary mlncrnas.

discussion
some mlncrnas shown sense or antisense homology with protein-coding genes involved in secondary metabolism in d. purpurea
transcriptomic analysis is an effective approach to discover genes particularly for those organisms without whole genome information, such as d. purpurea, an economically and ecologically important plant species. through high-throughput  <dig> sequencing and subsequent assembly, we obtained a high-quality d. purpurea unigene set comprising a total of  <dig> genes, which include  <dig> putatively involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids/cardiac glycosides, the most effective drugs to treat heart failure during the past two centuries  <cit> . the  <dig> genes were grouped into  <dig> families, representing about 75% of total cardiac glycoside biosynthesis-associated gene families in d. purpurea. these sequence data greatly enhance our knowledge of cardiac glycoside biosynthesis and provides useful information for manipulating cardiac glycoside biosynthesis in d. purpurea through biotechnology. more importantly, we found that  <dig> mlncrnas showed sense or antisense homology with  <dig> protein-coding genes involved in secondary metabolism, including one putatively involved in terpenoid biosynthesis .

hds is the penultimate enzyme of the seven-step dxp pathway, one of the two pathways generating the c <dig> backbone of all terpenoids including the hormone ga and cgs . it catalyzes the conversion of 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol  <dig> -cyclodiphosphate into 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate and is encoded by a single gene in various plants, including arabidopsis, hevea brasiliensis and ginkgo biloba  <cit> . through sequence similarity search and subsequent transcriptional direction analysis, we found that the 3' utr of d. purpurea hds gene contained a  <dig> bp-region with 87% identities to an mlncrna, mlncr <dig> . the expression of hds and mlncr <dig> was positively correlated at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours of cold and dehydration stresses . it indicates the existence of close relationship between hds and mlncr <dig> through a currently unknown mechanism.

sps gene involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone and plastoquinone is related to mlncr <dig>  it utilizes farnesyl diphosphate  and geranylgeranyl diphosphate  as substrates and is responsible for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid side chain of ubiquinone and plastoquinone in arabidopsis  <cit> . the 5' utr of d. purpurea sps gene harbors a  <dig> bp-region highly complementary to mlncr <dig> . the expression of sps gene is negatively correlated with mlncr <dig>  which is most noticeable in plantlets treated with cold stress for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours , indicating sps gene is regulated by mlncr <dig> through rna-mediated gene silencing in d. purpurea  <cit> . both ubiquinone and plastoquinone are electron carriers. plastoquinone is a member of the photosynthetic electron transport chain in chloroplast, while ubiquinone is a component of respiratory electron transport chain in mitochondria. thus, mlncr <dig> may be important in maintaining the activities of plant cells under environmental stress conditions.

in addition, mlncrnas are probably involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoid, carotenoid and alkaloid . the mlncrna, fxat9o005fzsi <dig>  share homology with a unigene  encoding dihydroflavonal-4-reductase , which catalyze the reduction of dihydroflavonol into flavan- <dig> -diol , a key step in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and other flavonoids important for plant survival and human nutrition  <cit> . fxat9o005gd1w <dig> appears the other mlncrna involved in secondary metabolism. it shows sequence similarity to a unigene  encoding phytoene dehydrogenase . pds, which catalyzes the desaturation of phytoene into phytofluene, is a rate-limiting enzyme in carotenoid biosynthesis in plants  <cit> . the mlncrna probably involved in alkaloid biosynthesis is fxat9o005fyd4c, which shares homology with the coding region of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase  gene . aadc catalyzes the decarboxylation of tyrosine into tyramine, a key step of plant alkaloid biosynthesis  <cit> .

taken together, these results strongly suggest the importance of mlncrnas in secondary metabolism in d. purpurea.

d. purpurea mlncrnas exhibit species-specific characteristics and are important in plant development and stress responses
using a computational mlncrna identification pipeline, we identified  <dig> d. purpurea mlncrna candidates, of which only about 12% can be grouped into families with at least two members in a family, while the others are single gene family members. furthermore, the conservation of mlncrnas is very low. searching the noncode database of known npcrnas, we found that only about  <dig> % of the mlncrnas analyzed was conserved, suggesting the vast majority of d. purpurea mlncrnas are species-specific. these results are consistent with those obtained from other plant species including m. truncatula, arabidopsis, wheat, and animals such as drosophila and mouse  <cit> , indicating mlncrnas may be evolved with a low degree of constraint and many of them are probably undergoing frequent birth and death. it is particularly true for the mlncrnas which produce non-conserved microrna families represented by single genes  <cit> .

in this study, we identified a total of  <dig> microrna-producing mlncrnas based on the conservation of mirna sequences and the secondary structure of unigenes  <cit> . the mature micrornas were classified into eight families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> . they were predicted to regulate at least  <dig> protein-coding genes, of which  <dig> encode conserved transcriptional factors, including two arfs, an ap <dig> and a grf . arfs play regulatory roles in the development of plant organs, such as seed, gynoecium, embryo, hypocotyl, root and petal in arabidopsis  <cit> . ap <dig> is involved in floral transition and floral development  <cit> . grf control cell proliferation in arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . it suggests the importance of micrornas in the development of d. purpurea plants. additionally, among the  <dig> protein-coding genes shown sense or antisense homology with mlncrnas, several, such as jo <dig>  fxat9o005fr21d, fxat9o005ge5af, fxat9o005f8dz <dig>  fxat9o005f4wf <dig> and fxat9o005gcss <dig>  encode transcription factors and other development-related proteins, indicating some non-microrna-producing mlncrnas are also probably involved in the development of d. purpurea plants . it is consistent with the findings showing the involvement of mlncrna  in pollen development in zea mays and the regulatory role of mlncrna  in symbiotic nitrogen-fixing nodule formation in legumes  <cit> .

expressional analysis of mlncrnas allowed us to identify  <dig> cold- and  <dig> dehydration-responsive mlncrnas, suggesting the importance of mlncrnas in stress responses in d. purpurea . in addition, the majority of mlncrnas analyzed were responsive to both cold and dehydration and many of them exhibited similar expression patterns under cold and dehydration conditions, indicating the cold signaling network and the dehydration signaling network are probably overlapped. stress responses of mlncrnas have been reported previously in various plants, including arabidopsis  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . for example, arabidopsis ips <dig> and m. truncatula mt <dig> mlncrnas are involved in phosphate starvation through fine-tuning the expression of mir399/pho <dig> gene  <cit> . arabidopsis coolair  and coldair  play significant roles in cold response and are required for the vernalization-mediated epigenetic repression of flc  <cit> . several wheat mlncrnas are responsive to powdery mildew infection and/or heat stress  <cit> . thus, mlncrnas seem to be very important for the whole plant kingdom to survive in the stressful environments.

functional mechanisms of mlncrnas in d. purpurea
mlncrnas have been found to interact with rna, dna and protein molecules  <cit> . a small portion of the identified d. purpurea mlncrnas produce conserved micrornas. since no small rna sequences are available and experimental setup does not allow us to detect the processed mirnas, we are not able to identify those producing non-conserved micrornas from the set of d. purpurea mlncrna candidates. however, it is rational to believe the existence of non-conserved microrna-producing d. purpurea mlncrnas based on the increasing number of non-conserved micrornas in the mirbase  <cit> . these mlncrnas play crucial roles in organ development and defense responses through producing conserved or non-conserved micrornas, which target other rna molecules for cleavage, or, in a few cases, for translational repression  <cit> . additionally, some mlncrnas play regulatory roles in plants through generating sirnas. these mlncrnas can be antisense transcripts of protein-coding genes, ta-sirna precursors, repeat-associated transcripts, or transcripts sharing antisense homology with protein-coding genes  <cit> . it is also possible that some mlncrnas may function through inhibiting the action of micrornas. for example, the arabidopsis mlncrna, ips <dig>  contains a  <dig> nt region complementary to mir <dig>  a microrna involved in phosphate starvation by targeting pho <dig> gene for cleavage. ips <dig> mimics pho <dig>  except that the base-pairing is interrupted by a mismatched loop at the mir <dig> cleavage. therefore, ips <dig> is not cleaved but instead sequesters mir <dig>  resulting in inhibition of mir <dig> activity on pho <dig>  <cit> . the sirna-generating mlncrnas and the mimics of microrna targets in our mlncrna set remain to be identified.

in this study, we predicted a total of  <dig> d. purpurea mlncrna candidates using a computational mlncrna identification pipeline. according to the sequence similarity between mlncrnas and protein-coding genes and the location of homologous regions in mlncrnas and protein-coding genes, the majority of mlncrnas candidates appear to be not the fragments of utrs of protein-coding genes . among the  <dig> mlncrna candidates,  <dig> mlncrnas share sense or antisense homology with  <dig> protein-coding genes, indicating that some mlncrnas and the corresponding protein-coding gene are probably homologous genes derived from a common ancestral gene, or these mlncrnas are new born genes originated from the corresponding protein-coding genes, as the case of long non-coding rna, xist, and the protein-coding gene, lnx <dig>  in mammals  <cit> . the mlncrnas sharing antisense homology with protein-coding genes, such as d. purpurea mlncr <dig>  seems to play a role in post-transcriptional regulation of the corresponding protein-coding genes. it is evidenced by the negative correlation of expression between mlncr <dig> and the sps gene after  <dig> hours of stress . the roles in post-transcriptional regulation have been previously reported for some long non-coding rnas identified from various animal species, such as human and mouse  <cit> . it is not well-known for the mechanisms of mlncrnas acting on protein-coding genes with sense homology, such as mlncr <dig>  mlncr <dig> and mlncr <dig> and their homologous protein-coding genes, vha-e, snrk and hds, respectively. one of the possible mechanisms is co-suppression, a phenomenon in plants in which a sense transgene sometimes cause suppression of both the endogenous gene and the transgene  <cit> . further identification of the interaction mechanism between mlncrnas and protein-coding genes will give us a much clearer picture of how mlncrnas function in d. purpurea.

CONCLUSIONS
the comprehensive analysis of transcriptome data from high-throughput sequencing allow us to discover many novel unigenes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, such as cardiac glycosides, ubiquinone, plastoquinone, flavonoid, carotenoid and alkaloid, and to identify a large number of mlncrna candidates in d. purpurea. detailed analysis suggests that the majority of d. purpurea mlncrnas are species-specific and most mlncrna families are single gene families. these mlncrnas exhibited tissue-specific expression and responded to cold and dehydration stresses. since at least  <dig> mlncrnas were found to be not only cold-responsive but also dehydration-responsive, a crosstalk could exist among mlncrnas in response to cold and dehydration stresses. the identified mlncrnas appears to be involved in many aspects, such as plant development, stress response and secondary metabolism. the regulatory role is associated with protein-coding genes sharing sequence similarity with the mlncrnas. these results provide novel and significant information for understanding the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and the function of mlncrnas. in addition, a large number of rnaseq data of d. purpurea have been recently released in the ncbi sra database under the series identifier srp <dig>  which provides an additional source for the discovery of genes and mlncrnas in d. purpurea.
