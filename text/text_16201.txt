BACKGROUND
sorghum  is a major staple crop and source of income for millions of people in western and central africa . the success of sorghum production is determined to a considerable extent by the appropriateness of the flowering time for the specific production environment. the highly variable sowing dates, due in part to erratic onset of the rainy season, present an important challenge since grain maturity needs to occur at a more fixed calendar date to coincide with the end of the rainy period for successful grain filling and pest avoidance  <cit> . thus, photoperiod-sensitive flowering responses of sorghum in wca enhance adaptation by enabling more fixed maturity dates despite variable sowing dates  <cit> .

the transition of plant growth from vegetative to generative stage is the primary determinant of flowering time in crops of determinant growth type such as sorghum. the degree to which varieties can adjust this onset of panicle initiation with differing sowing dates, and photoperiod conditions, is called photoperiodic flowering response  <cit> . photoperiod sensitivity triggers panicle initiation in short-day  plants such as sorghum when they sense an appropriate decrease in day length  <cit> .

the molecular basis of flowering time has been extensively studied in arabidopsis thaliana where mutant plants with an altered flowering phenotype were analyzed for their flowering behavior under laboratory conditions. as a result, four important pathways regulating floral induction have been identified: the photoperiod  promotion) pathway, gibberellic-acid promotion pathway, vernalization pathway, and autonomous pathway  <cit> . a basic understanding of the molecular complexity of flowering time in important agronomic species with large genomes such as maize , wheat , barley , and pearl millet  r. br.) has been facilitated by comparative use of floral pathways from a. thaliana . flowering time genes and sequences can be used by breeders for the development of molecular markers or for targeted genetic modification of flowering time.

current knowledge on genetics of photoperiod-sensitive flowering
since bünning  <cit>  first proposed that the photoperiodic time-keeping mechanism is associated with the circadian clock, there has been a considerable amount of research on the photoperiod pathway. the basis of day-length measurement is the interaction of an external light signal with the circadian rhythm  <cit> . in the photoperiod-sensitive flowering process , light signals are perceived by photoreceptors involved in the resetting of the circadian clock, with the result that plants respond to the light and dark cycles  <cit> . genes such as circadian clock associated <dig> , late elongated hypocotyl , and timing of cab expression <dig>  are the core components of the central oscillator of the circadian system. the oscillator determines the phase of constans  transcription  <cit> . co is an important gene that links the circadian clock to flowering  <cit> , and it induces the transcription of flowering locus t  to promote flowering  <cit> . recent research has shown that the ft protein in arabidopsis and corresponding proteins in other plants are an important part of the florigen  <cit> , which is a leaf-generated mobile flowering signal initiating floral morphogenesis at the shoot apex  <cit> .

status of research on flowering time genes in sorghum
a series of six maturity genes have been recognized to affect flowering time and photoperiodic flowering response in sorghum: ma <dig>  ma <dig>  ma <dig>  ma <dig>  ma <dig>  and ma <dig>  <cit> . the first four maturity genes inhibit flowering under ld conditions but allow early flowering under short day conditions. of these first four genes, ma <dig> causes the greatest sensitivity to ld conditions. in contrast, ma <dig>  ma <dig>  and ma <dig> generally have more modest effects on sensitivity to ld conditions  <cit> . kouressy et al.  <cit>  showed that photoperiod sensitivity was affected by dominant alleles of one major gene, equivalent to the ma <dig> or ma <dig> maturity loci identified by aydin et al.  <cit> . several other studies report on sorghum photoperiodic flowering  <cit> . these studies highlighted the role of phytochromes as an important gene family. childs et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the ma <dig> gene is synonymous to phyb and sequenced other phytochromes such as phya and phyc. it is interesting that mutations in sorghum ma <dig> and a. thaliana phyb both reduce sensitivity to non-inductive day-lengths  <cit> . recently, positional cloning identified ma <dig> as a putative pseudoresponse regulator protein  <dig> , which acts as inhibitor of co and floral activator genes  <cit> . bhattramakki et al.  <cit>  reported that primers for ssr marker xtxp <dig> are derived from the phyb sequence, but this sequence variation was not detected by white et al.  <cit>  in studies of the phyb sequence from several diverse sorghum accessions. there are indications that the xtxp <dig>  primer pair detects more than one locus as there are reports of xtxp <dig> mapping to sbi- <dig>  and/or sbi- <dig> . however, to our knowledge, there has not been a study analyzing systematically the effect of candidate genes  from the photoperiod sensitivity pathway on photoperiodic flowering response in sorghum.

advanced plant breeding techniques such as mas have the potential to accelerate the selection process substantially  <cit> . functional markers are the state-of-the-art molecular tools that minimize the risk of recombination between marker and qtl alleles  <cit> . association studies based on linkage disequilibrium offer a new possibility to identify marker-trait associations .

in this study we examined a panel of sorghum accessions from west africa established expressly to represent the range of photoperiodic response. the objectives of our study were to  characterize the photoperiodic flowering response of these sorghum accessions under field conditions, and  investigate the association between variation for photoperiodic sensitivity for flowering time and polymorphisms in six partially amplified genes putatively related to variation in flowering time in sorghum .

RESULTS
phenotypic evaluation
analysis of the field data on flowering time showed that sorghum accessions of our study exhibited a wide range of photoperiodic response. the days to 50% flowering  of sorghum accessions sown on  <dig> june ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and those sown on  <dig> july from  <dig> to  <dig> days, respectively . the pri for the accessions ranged from - <dig> to  <dig> . from the phenotypic data it was observed that when sown late  the accessions of sorghum generally showed a reduction of growth cycle compared to when sown earlier . the mean dfl50% values of the two sowing dates were significantly different . for both sowings dates, early-maturing accessions were generally less sensitive to photoperiod , than the late-maturing accessions . the mean plant height of the accessions in the june sowing was significantly  greater than their mean plant height in the july sowing.

co-localization of the genes on sorghum genome sequence
gene sequences of the cgs studied were blast-searched against the aligned sorghum genome sequence  to identify the physical locations of these genes. blast search identified that the cry1-b <dig> gene has its best possible hit on sorghum chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb , gi gene has a unique location on sorghum chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb , cry2- <dig> gene has a location on sorghum chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb , lhy gene is located on sorghum chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb , hd <dig> gene has its best possible hit on sorghum chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb , and sbd <dig> gene has its best possible hit on sorghum chromosome 1at  <dig>  mb .

to validate whether these genomic regions have any association with flowering genes like cry1b and gi, gene sequences for cry1b and gi from different cereals and other model crop species  were blast searched against the aligned sorghum genome. for each gene, only the best hit could be considered for budget reasons. for the six cgs, an overview of their blast scores, e-values with sorghum, and percentage similarity with their respective homologs in arabidopsis and rice obtained by direct nucleotide sequence comparisons is given in table  <dig> 

candidate gene sequence diversity
sequences obtained from primers designed in this study  were the desired fragments of the targeted gene . this was confirmed by the high blast scores obtained when all fragments were searched against the sorghum genome sequence database  using the blast tool. for the cgs, 35% of the total sequenced region  was coding and 65% was non-coding. the number of polymorphic sites was highest for gi and lowest for cry2- <dig> . considering all six genes in this study, the average number of polymorphic sites  was  <dig> , the average nucleotide diversity  was  <dig> , and tajima's d value was negative for all genes and was highly significant for genes cry2- <dig>  hd <dig>  and gi.

for each gene, the total predicted size and the size of amplified fragment, s number of polymorphic sites, π the pairwise nucleotide diversity and tajima's d value are reported; **, *** significant at p <  <dig>  and <  <dig> , respectively

linkage disequilibrium analyses
a linkage disequilibrium analysis was performed for six cgs under study. the average r <dig> values for the cgs were, cry1-b <dig> =  <dig> , cry2- <dig> =  <dig> , lhy- <dig> =  <dig> , hd <dig> =  <dig> , gi =  <dig> , and sbd <dig> =  <dig> . in the case of the cry1-b <dig> gene, two strong linkage disequilibrium blocks were detected at the 5' utr  and at the 3' end of the sequence . the linkage disequilibrium matrix plots for the cgs studied are shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

association analyses with candidate genes
association analyses were performed for all polymorphic sites in all six genes sequenced. significant  associations were found between pri and several polymorphic sites within cgs cry1-b <dig> and gi . the snp <dig> in cry1-b <dig>  and snp <dig> in gi  showed effects on pri of - <dig>  and + <dig> days, respectively. a negative effect on pri means that the difference in flowering time between the june and july sowing dates was reduced , whereas a positive effect on pri indicates that the difference in flowering time was increased .

discussion
photoperiod sensitivity
the variability for photoperiod sensitivity observed in this panel of sorghum accessions was very large, ranging from highly insensitive varieties  to highly sensitive . the accessions that matured earlier in both sowings were mostly the least photoperiod-sensitive ones . earlier-flowering accessions made the transition from vegetative growth to generative growth before the day-length reached the critical photoperiods required to induce flowering in the later-flowering photoperiod-sensitive accessions. for accessions flowering comparatively late in the june planting, the critical photoperiod significantly reduced flowering time when they were sown under decreasing day-length conditions in july. this was clearly demonstrated by significantly lower mean dfl50% of the july sowing compared to the mean dfl50% of june sowing in these late, photoperiod-sensitive accessions. this reduction in mean dfl50% comes with its consequence, as the mean plant height of the accessions in the july sowing was significantly lower than their mean plant height in the june sowing. similar observations on reduction in vegetative growth resulting from decreasing day-length conditions were made by folliard et al.  <cit>  on a guinea sorghum cultivar, where total number of leaves was reduced by half when it was sown at four different sowing dates. the diversity of photoperiod response of our panel of accessions made it an appropriate choice for association analysis for candidate flowering genes.

linkage disequilibrium analyses
the linkage disequilibrium measure r <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the cgs in our study. the mean r <dig> of  <dig>  was comparable to the study on sorghum  <cit>  reporting r <dig> >  <dig>  but lower than the previous study on barley  <cit>  which reported r <dig> >  <dig> . the variability in the range of r <dig> estimates observed in our study can be due to the fact that linkage disequilibrium estimates vary according to the target genomic region as well as number of polymorphic sites  <cit> . furthermore, because of limited coverage  of the cgs studied, it seems inappropriate to describe the decay of linkage disequilibrium along each cg. full length sequencing of the studied and additional important photoperiod cgs will be necessary to describe patterns of linkage disequilibrium in the sorghum flowering time gene network.

population structure and association analysis
the cgs chosen for this study were selected on the basis of comparative genomic studies on photoperiodic flowering time genes in a. thaliana and rice  <cit> . from these studies it was evident that the respective genes have a high degree of similarity in structure and function between the latter two species.

using software structure to infer population structure, and employing evanno's method to estimate the number of subgroups, our sorghum germplasm panel could be divided into two subgroups  <cit> . race as well as the geographical origin of the accessions, played a role in the population structure of these sorghum accessions. we used a mixed-model method for association analysis that takes into account population structure as well as kinship information. this model has proven to yield better results in association studies compared to models ignoring these factors  <cit> . the marker-phenotype association analysis was carried out using values of pri for each accession. the field experiments were conducted in one year  and at one location. significant genotype × year interactions for measures of photoperiod-sensitive flowering response might occur in multi-location trials over years; however, the sorghum accessions of our study have been observed previously for their photoperiodic behavior over years and therefore some background information on their photoperiod response was known.

out of the six genes analyzed, we detected in fragments of genes cry1-b <dig> and gi several polymorphic sites that were significantly  associated with pri variation in our sorghum panel. the first two candidate genes considered in our study were cry1-b <dig> and cry2- <dig>  in plants, cryptochromes and phototropins  <cit>  are the two types of blue light/uv-a receptors important for plant photomorphogenesis. in a. thaliana, cry <dig> mainly functions in de-etiolation  <cit> , while cry <dig> plays a role in the regulation of photoperiodic flowering  <cit> . hirose et al.  <cit>  showed that over-expression of oscry <dig> in rice resulted in enhanced responsiveness to blue light, suggesting that oscry <dig> is a regulator of photomorphogenesis, similar to atcry <dig>  like atcry <dig>  oscry <dig> is also involved in the promotion of flowering time in rice  <cit> . but it was also shown that sub-cellular localization of atcry <dig> does not change in response to blue light  <cit> . in our analysis, we did not find any significant associations of the cry2- <dig> gene with pri but several polymorphisms in the cry1-b <dig> gene were significantly associated with pri, where the most important polymorphisms showed an effect on pri value of up to - <dig>  days .

the cry <dig> gene sequence in sorghum  has three important domains namely i) dna photolyase - binding a light harvesting cofactor  <cit> , ii) fad  binding domain of the dna photolyase - involved in energy harness of blue light  <cit> , and iii) blue/ultraviolet-sensing protein c terminal - this domain is found in association with two previous domains in eukaryotes  <cit> . our blast results showed that the cry1-b <dig> gene fragment that we analyzed was located between the first domain  and the beginning of second domain  of the sbcry <dig> gene. the snp at position  <dig> in cry1-b <dig> was therefore located in the domain of the dna photolyase located at the n-terminal domain of sbcry <dig>  in a. thaliana, it was shown that the n-terminal domain of the cry <dig> gene was essential for blue light reception  <cit> . this domain catalyzes the repair of photo-damage to the light-harvesting apparatus resulting from ultraviolet irradiation. photolyases and cryptochromes are related flavoproteins that bind fad. photolyases harness the energy of blue light and cryptochromes  mediate blue light-induced gene expression  <cit> . therefore the effect of the snp at position  <dig> at the n-terminal in our sbcry1-b <dig> sequence suggested that the change in nucleotide base from t to a  might play an important role in blue light reception in sorghum. this observation can be supported by the fact that in wheat the n-terminal domain of tacry <dig> contains a sequence signal important for its nuclear export. therefore, a detailed analysis of sbcry <dig> comparing its n-terminal domain with its c-terminal domain might reveal their exact roles in photomorphogenesis.

in addition to cry1-b <dig>  we found several polymorphic sites in the sorghum gi gene homolog to be significantly associated with pri, with the largest effect on pri of about  <dig> days . hayama et al.  reported that in rice, rather than promoting flowering, osgi expression results in the suppression of flowering under ld. it has been proposed that genetic mechanisms of photoperiodic control in rice are similar to those in a. thaliana, but vary in downstream signaling of gi, at the regulation of ft. in ld conditions, co promotes flowering through ft activation in a. thaliana and conversely represses ft and flowering in rice, which is a sd plant  <cit> . similar to the observations in rice  <cit> , the positive allele effect on pri observed in this study  indicates that sbgi enhances photoperiodic response to sd conditions in sorghum, i.e., sbgi shortens the time to sorghum flowering in the later july sowing which is more exposed to sd conditions, while in the june sowing , sbgi delays sorghum flowering. therefore, detailed investigation by comparison of accessions grown under sd and ld conditions would be necessary to determine the exact mode of action of the gi gene homolog in sorghum. tajima's d values for the gene fragments sequenced in our study were negative  with three genes  having significantly negative values. possible reasons for negative tajima's d values  may be, firstly, that the sorghum accessions of our study originated from different geographical regions and had little common history. secondly, it has been suggested that population structure existing among the ancestral populations as a result of multiple domestications and introgressions from wild relatives could give rise to negative tajima's d values . thirdly, the negative tajima's d values might indicate that the gene fragments used in our study may have been subjected to adaptive selection as variation in flowering time may confer adaptive advantages in sorghum .

CONCLUSIONS
when looking at the flowering time gene network as a whole, purifying selection is found in both coding and non-coding dna regions  <cit> . the sorghum sequence dataset of our study is in agreement with this observation. certainly, conclusions can be drawn from tajima's d estimates found in our study about natural selection affecting the studied sorghum genomic regions. however, in our study the number of genes as well as the size of the each cg fragment studied was small for effectively capturing the signature of selection on photoperiodic flowering time genes. it will be necessary to characterize the entire flowering time gene network in sorghum to know how selection has shaped the photoperiod pathway of flowering time and thus helped sorghum to adapt to climatic zones with different day-length conditions.

to utilize the snps identified to be significantly associated with pri in our study, molecular markers could be designed based on coinciding endonuclease restriction sites which in turn could be used to create cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  markers  <cit> . furthermore, functional markers could be created directly from the significant snps. these markers can thus serve as powerful tools for mas in sorghum to identify accessions or segregants having specific sensitivities to photoperiod.
