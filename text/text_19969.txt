BACKGROUND
next generation sequencing  is quickly becoming the standard for the generation of cheap, accurate and high throughput dna sequence data  <cit> . the major ngs platforms are roche  <dig> gs-flx titanium , illumina gaiix  and solid <dig> , which differ in read length, error rate and cost  <cit> . transcriptome sequencing using ngs, commonly known as rna-seq, enables rapid and cost-effective gene and marker discovery, gene expression analysis, detection of rare variants and splice isoforms. most previous studies have involved sequencing plant transcriptomes with completed reference genomes available, such as arabidopsis thalina  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit>  and zea mays  <cit> . direct sequencing of the transcriptome of non-model organisms has the potential to rapidly generate valuable genomic resources in poorly known species. however, de novo transcriptome assembly is challenging due to short reads, lack of reference sequences and the need for development of improved bioinformatic tools to facilitate data analysis  <cit> .

most de novo transcriptome studies have used the roche  <dig> platforms  <cit>  as the longer reads allow more reliable de novo assembly, however, the reactions are relatively expensive, reducing the potential sequencing coverage which plays a major role in the accuracy of de novo assembly. hybrid sequencing approaches using 454/illumina technologies can successfully reduce cost and compensate for different sequencing technology biases  <cit> . while sequencing exclusively using illumina technology, the most widely published ngs platform is an attractive and cheap alternative as the high coverage obtained can overcome sequencing error rates and short read length, relatively few de novo transcriptome studies have exploited these advantages in plants  <cit> https://atgc-illumina.googlecode.com/files/pag_2010_akozik_v <dig> pdf. as read lengths increase, paired-end library construction techniques improve and costs continue to go down, illumina rna-seq will become a powerful tool for transcriptome characterization of non-model plants.

acacia mangium and acacia auriculiformis are important forest tree species, belonging to the fabaceae or legume family, and are native to australia, papua new guinea and indonesia. a. mangium is widely planted in southeast asia because of its superior growth, wide site suitability and multiple uses  <cit>  while a. auriculiformis has higher adaptability, greater durability and is less susceptible to diseases than a. mangium. a. auriculiformis and a. mangium are predominantly out-crossing  <cit> . naturally-crossed acacia hybrids were first noted in sabah in the late 1970s  <cit> . these hybrids possessed many attractive traits highly sought in tree improvement, such as enhanced growth, form, disease resistance and adaptability. for the wood and pulp industry, the acacia hybrids have great potential as raw material due to superior growth, longer wood fibers and better pulp quality over their parents  <cit> . low lignin and high cellulose content are desirable in the pulping process and studies have shown increased accumulation of cellulose occurs when lignin is reduced in plants  <cit> . the monolignol biosynthesis pathway is well-characterized but the coordination and regulation of genes in the pathway is not well-understood. recent studies revealed that known regulatory sequences, including several classes of transcription factors and micrornas play important roles in regulation of lignin and wood formation  <cit> . these regulatory sequences may be good candidates in selective breeding and genetic engineering programs to increase pulp yield and reduce pulping costs.

the c-value for a. auriculiformis and a. mangium  are estimated to be  <dig>  pg and  <dig>  pg respectively  <cit>  while a. auriculiformis × a. mangium hybrid genome size is estimated to be  <dig> mb  <cit> , making the hybrid genome  <dig>  times larger than the populus trichocarpa genome. currently, no genome sequences for any acacia species are available although the genomes of several model legume species like m. truncatula and glycine max have been sequenced. unfortunately, all of these model legumes are in a separate subfamily, the faboideae, while acacia species are in the mimosoideae subfamily. in terms of est resources for a. mangium, a total of  <dig> from floral tissues  <cit> ,  <dig>  from secondary xylem and shoot tissue  <cit>  and  <dig>  from inner bark of the a. auriculiformis × a. mangium hybrid  <cit>  have been deposited in the ncbi dbest. however, no genomic resources is available for a. auriculiformis. several important genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis and wood-related pathways including cinammate 4-hydroxylase , caffeoyl coa 3-o-methyltransferase , cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase , phenylalanine ammonia lyase , caffeic acid o-methyltransferase  and cellulose synthase  have been successfully isolated and characterized from the acacia hybrid  <cit> .

conventional breeding programs for the improvement of forest trees are slow, laborious and land intensive due to the long life cycle and large size of trees. the application of genomic approaches facilitated by emerging dna sequencing technologies may significantly accelerate the breeding program. due to the lack of genomic resources for tree crops particularly tropical species, the simple discovery of genes controlling wood-related traits will be a major step forward. ultimately, the development of large-scale genomic resources will facilitate the application of linkage and association mapping within tree improvement programs.

here we applied paired-end illumina gaii sequencing to non-normalized cdnas of a. auriculiformis and a. mangium to discover important genes involved in lignin and secondary cell wall formation in these non-model tree species. using standard de novo assembly algorithms, we examined the quality of the contigs generated and attempted to identify wood-related genes particularly genes and their isoforms in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway. we also sought to identify potential transcription factors involved in secondary wood formation and lignin deposition, and highly conserved micrornas and their wood-related gene targets. a major objective in our analysis was to detect a large number of informative snps to be used for linkage mapping of hybrid progenies and population genetic studies of the two parental species. our results could provide powerful tools for the efficient selection of hybrid offsprings with favorable traits, allowing rapid and continued improvement.

RESULTS
de novo transcriptome assembly
in this study, we constructed non-normalized cdna libraries for each parental species as this will produce more full length transcripts for significant gene discovery. each library was sequenced using one lane of a flow cell on the illumina gaii platform using paired end protocols. we obtained  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  <dig> bp paired-end raw reads for a. auriculiformis and a. mangium, respectively. filtering and conversion to fastq format resulted in  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads for a. auriculiformis and a. mangium respectively. after filtering of ribosomal rna sequences, 51-57% of the reads remained with an average phred score of  <dig> -  <dig> 

the filtered reads were used to perform de novo assembly using a number of software such as velvet  <cit> , soapdenovo  <cit>  and oases  <cit> , however, we found soapdenovo produced the longest assemblies despite using longer k-mers. we assessed different k-mer sizes and chose 29-mer to obtain a good tradeoff between assembly size and accuracy. de novo transcriptome assembly for a. auriculiformis  and a. mangium  produced  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs with an n <dig> contig size of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, a longest contig of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, and an average length of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively . the sequencing depth was estimated to be  <dig>  × and  <dig>  × respectively. blastx indicated that the longest contig of aa and am were homologs of the a. thaliana big; binding/ubiquitin-protein ligase/zinc ion binding gene . this gene which is one of the longest genes in plants, was also reported in de novo transcriptome assembly of lettuce https://atgc-illumina.googlecode.com/files/pag_2010_akozik_v <dig> pdf.

to determine the similarity at the nucleotide level between the transcriptomes, we first mapped filtered reads to their corresponding de novo contigs before mapping each set of reads against the contigs obtained from the other species. to substantially increase the number of mappable reads, we mapped single-end reads using bowtie -v setting allowing three mismatches. a total of  <dig> , <dig> aa single-end reads  and  <dig> , <dig> am single-end reads  mapped to their corresponding contigs. we observed only a small drop  in the proportion of mappable reads from one acacia species to the contigs of the other acacia species indicating that the two transcriptomes shared a great deal of identity at the nucleotide level and are closely related.

the observation that a large proportion of filtered reads failed to map to the acacia transcriptomes  led us to investigate their origins by mapping to various genomes . a further 5-6% of the reads mapped to the transcriptome of the other acacia species probably due to differentially expressed transcripts. we discovered that approximately 14% of the reads mapped to mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of a. thaliana, suggesting a significant amount of mitochondrial and chloroplast transcripts were sequenced. we suspect that mitochondrion sequences may not be assembled due to the highly heterozygous nature of genomes that were present in high copy number. we tried to map the remaining reads to several model plant genomes but found less than 10% mappable reads and no huge differences between these plant genomes. the number of reads mappable to the model legume, m. truncatula masked genome version mt <dig>  was  <dig> - <dig> %. the remaining ~36% of filtered reads were unmappable possibly due to several reasons. some of these reads may be unique acacia sequences from intergenic and intronic regions based on observation from wang et al.  <cit>  study that reported  <dig> % of rna-seq reads from aspergillus oryzae were located at these regions. other reasons such as lack of acacia genome information, poor quality reads and microbial contamination may have contributed to the large number of unmappable reads.

discovery of monolignol biosynthetic genes and isoforms
the monolignol biosynthesis pathway consists of several large protein families with members commonly known as isoforms. isoform identification is challenging due to presence of many closely related superfamily members  in the transcriptome, i.e.  <dig> "like" proteins of comt, ccr and 4cl were observed in a. thaliana  <cit> . in this study, we found a total of  <dig> contigs in aa and am transcriptomes with e-value ≤ 1e- <dig> corresponding to all ten monolignol genes in a. thaliana. gene identification using blast alone often resulted in an overestimation of the total number of genes and isoforms. shi et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> members of phenylpropanoid genes found in p. trichocarpa genome using blastp , however, many are proposed to be unrelated to monolignol biosynthesis pathway based on phylogenetic and expression analysis. therefore, we tried to remove unrelated proteins by checking the conserved motifs which provide important clues in protein function and identity. we excluded contigs with low homology to a. thaliana monolignol genes  and we checked the remaining contigs for conserved amino acid motifs identified in previous studies  <cit>  from the protein alignments .

we were able to detect all ten genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis pathway, namely phenylalanine ammonia lyase , cinammate 4-hydroxylase , 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase , caffeic acid o-methyltransferase , ferulate 5-hydroxylase , 4-coumarate:coa ligase , hydroxycinnamoyl-coa shikimate/quinatehydroxy-cinnamoyltransferase , caffeoyl coa 3-o-methyltransferase , cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase , cinnamoyl co-a reductase  compared to traditional est sequencing in a. mangium  <cit>  and a. auriculiformis × a. mangium hybrid  <cit> . we discovered more than one isoform for half of the genes which failed to be detected by est sequencing. we identified a total of  <dig> isoforms for each species whereas  <dig> orthologous isoforms were shared in both species . all isoforms shared high identities with the corresponding a. thaliana genes where c3h shared the highest identity , followed by pal , c4h , ccoaomt , hct , cad , comt , ccr , 4cl  and f5h . our observations that orthologous isoforms of aa and am shared at least 99% similarity at both nucleotide and protein level while isoforms within the same family usually do not share an exact match of more than  <dig> nucleotides are important in determining the number of isoforms for both species.


the total assembled sequence lengths of the  <dig> isoforms ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and only  <dig> contained complete open reading frame . no polyadenylation site was observed as expected because short polya sequences failed to be assembled. one limitation of our sequence analysis is the presence of gap region in the contigs. half of the assembled sequences contain gap regions with the total size range of  <dig> -  <dig> bp. these regions which were masked by ns often occur at low coverage area where two contigs or mate pairs are connected during scaffolding. although most de novo assemblers can estimate the size of the gap region, the predicted size is not always correct and sometimes resulting in inaccurate protein prediction. it is recommended to double-check the protein sequences by translating each fragment in gapped assemblies using other protein prediction software. missing data poses a challenge to sequence comparison and analysis and therefore, gap filling by resequencing should be done in the future.

the total number of isoforms detected in this study is generally lower than those found in a. thaliana  <cit>  and p. trichocarpa  <cit> . the identified isoforms possessed 99% dna sequence identity with previously characterized isoforms from a. auriculiformis × a. mangium hybrid for the five isoforms that we examined, namely pal, c4h, comt, ccoaomt, and cad  <cit> . the high sequence similarity between of a. auriculiformis, a. mangium and their hybrids will allow more efficient cross amplification in gene isolation and characterization efforts. given that several isoforms were only found in one species, greater sequencing depth is required for our analysis to overcome incomplete assemblies and sampling biases, previously observed in genomic sequences of pseudomonas syringae strains  <cit> . nevertheless, transcriptome sequencing of other tissues such as secondary xylem will provide more differentially expressed isoforms which can be new targets for the improvement of wood properties.

identification of wood-related transcription factors
we found  <dig>  aa and  <dig>  am contigs with high sequence identity  corresponding to  <dig> and  <dig> families out of  <dig> a. thaliana transcription factor families downloaded from plntfdb  <cit> . the five most abundant transcriptional gene families were wkry, orphans, phd, hb and the myb-related group. several major classes of transcription factors involved in lignin and wood formation were found in both species , generally in similar numbers of contigs, although the nac family was substantially more abundant in aa. additionally, eight aa and nine am contigs were identified as class iii hd-zip, a member of homeobox  family.

some members of the r2r3-myb family are known to be involved in controlling lignin deposition and secondary wall formation by interacting with other r2r3-myb genes, activated by nac transcription factor master switches and binding to ac elements  <cit> . the ac elements are cis-acting elements found in most promoters of monolignol biosynthetic genes  <cit> . in this study, we identified five contigs, two in aa and three in am, which are homologous to r2r3-mybs regulating wood-related pathways in other plant species. in addition to r2r3-mybs, ntlim <dig> in tobacco had been proven to bind ac elements and its inhibition reduced lignin content  <cit> . we found one am contig which was highly homologous to tobacco ntlim <dig> with 86% identity.

phylogenetic analysis of the acacia r2r3-myb proteins with wood-related r2r3-mybs from a. thaliana and other plant species showed that they fall into three groups . in group one, three acacia r2r3-myb proteins, namely aaumyb <dig>  amgmyb <dig> and aaumyb <dig> are close homologs of arabidopsis myb <dig> and pine myb <dig> while aaumyb <dig> and amgmyb <dig> are orthologs. pine myb <dig> is a close homolog of myb <dig> whose overexpression caused ectopic lignin deposition but the exact functions are yet to be known  <cit> . only one am r2r3-myb protein  belongs to group two which is a close homolog to arabidopsis myb <dig> and myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> are activated by nac master switches to regulate downstream myb proteins in wood-related pathways  <cit>  whereas myb <dig> can induce secondary wall biosynthetic genes  <cit> . another member of this group, pinemyb <dig> is able to bind ac elements  <cit>  and is involved in secondary cell wall deposition  <cit> . aaumyb <dig> belongs to group three that clustered together with egmyb <dig>  ammyb <dig>  zmmyb <dig> and zmmyb <dig>  indicates an important role in regulating the monolignol biosynthesis pathway. egmyb <dig> binds ac element and represses the monolignol biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . ammyb <dig>  zmmyb <dig> and zmmyb <dig> have been shown to affect lignin content by regulating the expression of lignin genes  <cit> .

identification of microrna genes and gene targets
for non-model species like acacia, micrornas  can be identified from the transcriptome data based on homology searches against publicly available databases  <cit> . we searched for mirnas by comparing our contigs to known plants mirna stem-loop sequences downloaded from mirbase  <cit> . we found nine matching sequences from aa corresponding to eight conserved families  and one recently identified family . four of these families  were also found in am. most predicted mirna genes such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> are highly conserved in plants. the number of mirnas detected in this study was lower compared to another study  <cit>  because mirnas are most abundant in leaves and flowers.

blastx results showed that all primary transcripts except mir <dig> have no significant hits to any protein-coding gene, suggesting that primary transcript sequences are less conserved in plants. primary transcripts of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were removed from further analysis due to incomplete stem-loop structure and missing mature mirna sequence. the presence of gap region in the stem loop sequences of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> in aa resulted in inaccurate stem-loop structure prediction. therefore, pcr amplification and sequencing were carried out to fill up the gap. the secondary structures of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> predicted by mfold were stable  and all except mir <dig> have high mfei values . mir <dig> is a relatively new family highly expressed in the stem of m. truncatula  <cit> . blastx indicated that both primary transcripts of mir <dig> code for dna glycosylase . the predicted target of mir <dig> is nodulin-like protein suggesting it might play a role in nitrogen fixing pathway. this family is predicted to be a legume-specific mirna.

a total of  <dig> and  <dig> contigs in aa and am were predicted to be the targets for  <dig> and  <dig> mirna families found in plants. blastx results for the predicted targets of several highly conserved mirnas are indicated in table  <dig>  we found known targets such as auxin response factor, apetala  <dig>  f-box protein, cc-nbs-lrr disease resistance genes and heat shock protein for mirna  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  we predicted three wood-related genes, namely flavonol synthase-like, xyloglucan fucosyltransferase and glucan synthase-like genes to be the targets of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively, suggesting that mirnas might be directly involved in the regulation of phenylpropanoid pathway and hemicellulose biosynthesis pathway. glucan synthase is involved in the synthesis of xyloglucan which make up the β- <dig> -glucan backbone while xyloglucan fucosyltransferase adds fructose sidechains to the backbone. downregulation of flavonol synthase is predicted to redirect the carbon flux towards lignin biosynthesis as flavonoid biosynthesis uses 4-coumaroyl coa as precursor. functional analysis of these putative mirna targets for potential role in wood formation should be studied in the future.

detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are abundant markers that are suitable for a species with low genetic diversity such as a. mangium  <cit> . for a non-model species without genome sequences, we detected snps by mapping all the reads to de novo contigs as reference. we used only contigs at least  <dig> bp long to ensure sufficient flanking region for genotyping purposes. although paired-end reads provide more accurate alignments, a large fraction of our contigs were too short to effectively utilize the paired end information, so we mapped the reads as single-end data, which substantially increased the number of mappable reads.

by using bowtie default settings and allowing two mismatches, we detected a total of  <dig>  aa and  <dig>  am putative snps. after applying several filtering parameters to remove low coverage, low confidence, low minor frequency allele and multi-allelic snps, the putative snps number was further reduced to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . as expected, transition snps occur almost twice as frequently as transversion snps. one snp was estimated to occur in every  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in the aa and am transcriptomes, respectively. although these snps represent only a portion of the acacia transcriptome, this study has provided a better snps estimation compared to a previous study  <cit>  which was based on the snps variation in two lignin genes. further investigations are being carried to validate these snps which are useful for the construction of acacia hybrid linkage map.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first comprehensive transcriptome-wide analysis of acacia auriculiformis and acacia mangium. our results provide valuable genetic resources for further investigation of lignin biosynthesis and wood-related pathways in acacia hybrids. as next generation sequencing and analytical techniques improve, whole transcriptome sequencing using short read platforms will be the most cost-effective way for significant discovery of genes, regulatory sequences and markers in previously unstudied plants.
