BACKGROUND
p <dig> is a tumour suppressor protein that regulates the cell cycle and maintains the genomic integrity of the cell by orchestrating the activity of a wide variety of genes involved in repair, apoptosis and senescence  <cit>  it is a multidomain protein and functions as a tetramer. two homologous genes which are shown to share structural and functional homology with p <dig> are p <dig> and p <dig>  whose isoforms are known to regulate some of the same apoptotic pathways that are also regulated by p <dig>  <cit> . these three proteins posses a modular architecture, constituted by an n-terminal transactivation domain, a dna binding domain  and a regulatory c-terminal oligomerization domain  <cit> . the vast majority of tumour-derived p <dig> mutations map to the dbd  <cit> . the dbd mutations fall into two categories:  mutations that are at the dna binding region of p <dig> and hence disable the binding of p <dig> to dna and  mutations that alter the structural integrity and stability of p <dig> itself. the latter can cause local and global structural perturbations leading to the unfolding of p <dig> and so any process that can reverse this is likely to be of therapeutic value. it is known that the destabilizing effects of the latter can be countered by other mutations, the so-called second site suppressor mutations, and also by small molecules  <cit> . this underscores the importance of understanding the basis of the stability of this region.

the dbd has been characterized structurally in complex with its cognate dna by x-ray crystallography  <cit>  and in its free form in solution by nmr  <cit> . the stability of isolated dbd has been found to be similar to that of intact p <dig>  <cit> . in addition, several crystal structures of the oncogenic mutants have also been solved to understand the structural basis for the inactivation of this domain  <cit> . the p <dig> core domain consists of a central β-sandwich that serves as a basic scaffold to which anchor the dna binding surface and the surface of the dimeric partner dbd. contacts to dna are mediated through two large loops l <dig> and l <dig> held together by a zn2+ ion and a loop-sheet-helix motif . contacts to the dimeric partner dbd are mediated through the h <dig> helix . zn2+ ion is known to play a critical role in maintaining the structural stability and dna binding specificity  <cit> . in spite of this seemingly stable architecture , the core domain is known to be highly unstable, with a melting temperature of ~42–44°c  <cit> ; the reasons for this are not yet understood. in contrast, the homologs p <dig> and p <dig> melt at higher temperatures . the core domain of p <dig> binds to different dna sequences, depending on whether it enables the expression of genes that regulate cell cycle arrest or those that regulate apoptosis or indeed those that lead to the expression of other regulators. this process is further modulated by a host of other proteins that interact with the core domain too. progress is now being made in understanding how this modulation occurs; for example there are proteins whose binding sites on the p <dig> core domain overlap with the binding sites of dna sequences  <cit>  there is some thought that the relatively low stability of the core domain is perhaps necessary to  enable rapid destruction of p <dig> in normal cells and  the rapid interactions with a multitude of proteins and dna sequences in stressed cells. this clearly suggests that any changes in the core  that will affect the stability of the core will translate into differing affinities for partner proteins and for the various dna sequences and, hence the functions of p <dig> are bound to be affected  <cit> ; however, a direct correlation remains to be established.

in an effort to understand the origins of instability of p <dig>  fersht & co-workers  <cit>  noticed that the core is characterized by two polar residues, tyr <dig>  and thr <dig>  whose equivalents in p63/p <dig> are two apolar residues, phe <dig> and ile <dig>  these two residues are two polar residues that are buried in an otherwise hydrophobic core of p <dig> dbd . hypothesizing that the presence of buried polar groups may incur a penalty that might destabilize p <dig>  they replaced the two residues with the apolar equivalents from p63/p <dig> and found that the stability of mutant p <dig> had indeed increased . analogous mutations that transform the core of p <dig> or p <dig> into that of p <dig> have not been reported in the literature.

in order to examine this problem computationally, we performed a set of studies that included building homology models of p <dig> and p <dig> , and carried out molecular dynamics simulations and reaction path calculations to explore the basis of stability in p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> and their mutants. we created double mutants of p <dig>  replacing the tyr <dig> and thr <dig> by phe and ile respectively  in the manner of fersht & co-workers. in addition, we also mutated p <dig> and p <dig> by replacing their core residues phe <dig> and ile <dig> by the corresponding polar residues in p <dig> ie, tyr and thr .

RESULTS
the structural models of p <dig> and p <dig>  as expected from the similarity of their sequences to p <dig>  are very similar overall to the template structure of p <dig> . the root mean squared deviation  over equivalent c-α atoms  is  <dig>  Å between p63/p <dig> and p <dig> and  <dig>  Å between p <dig> and p <dig> 

during the dynamics, the structural variations as measured by the rmsd and the radius of gyrations as a function of time for the  <dig> systems are shown in fig.  <dig> and  <dig> and suggest that the simulations are stable. the mean rmsd values are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å respectively for p <dig>  dp <dig>  p <dig>  dp <dig>  p <dig> and dp <dig>  while the rmsd during the simulation has been used as an indicator of deviations from stability in some systems with an increase in the magnitude generally representative of destabilizing influences  <cit> , we find no distinct pattern that indicates this in our systems. the only notable difference is seen in the wild type p <dig> simulation, which is due to the distortions of helix  <dig> of the dna binding motif. the mean radius of gyration is  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  Å respectively for p <dig>  dp <dig>  p <dig>  dp <dig>  p <dig> and dp <dig>  these results suggest that the simulations are stable and indicate that the globularity of the protein is retained throughout, without being affected significantly by the mutations. the similarity of the magnitudes of rmsd and radius of gyration of p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> shows that the similarity of the structures is reflected in global dynamics.

the positional fluctuations of the c-α atoms  show that the pattern of fluctuations in the wild type  p <dig> are similar to the experimental bvalues . in all  <dig> systems, differences between the wild type and mutants are seen in the fluctuations in l <dig>  l <dig>  and the loops connecting s6–s <dig>  s7–s <dig> and s9–s <dig>  patterns in l <dig>  s6–s <dig> loop, and s9–s <dig> loop are similar between p <dig> and p <dig> while in l <dig>  s7–s <dig> loop, l <dig> the patterns are similar between p <dig> and p <dig> . in the l <dig> region, between the wild type and mutants, while p <dig> and p <dig> show fluctuations that are larger than in the corresponding mutants, the fluctuations in l <dig> in dp <dig> are a little larger than in p53; the s6–s <dig> loop in p <dig> fluctuates almost twice as much as it does in dp <dig>  in contrast the fluctuations in dp <dig> and dp <dig> are larger than in p <dig> and p <dig>  the s7–s <dig> region in the mutants fluctuates more than in the wild type in p <dig> and p <dig> while it fluctuates less in p <dig>  in l <dig> the pattern of fluctuations is similar in p <dig> wild type and mutant while they are larger in the mutant than in the wild type of p <dig> and in p <dig> they are larger in the wild type than in the mutant. the dynamics of loop l <dig> have been implicated in stability and in dna binding from recent nmr studies  <cit>  and l <dig> is involved in making contacts with the dimeric partner  <cit> .

principal component analysis
in order to further explore the nature of the fluctuations, principal component analyses  were carried out for all six systems. these yield a description of the dynamics of the protein in terms of the essential spaces  they inhabit  <cit> . it is clear that 80% of the fluctuations are captured by the top ten pcs  and is generally a feature observed across a range of proteins  <cit> . pc <dig> contributes between 25–40% of the fluctuations with pc <dig> contributing about 12–15%. there is an increase in the contributions of pc <dig> in dp <dig> compared to that in p <dig>  there is not much variation in pc <dig> in p <dig>  while in p <dig> there is a decrease in pc <dig>  this suggests at first glance that if the stability of p <dig> increases in the mutant form as has been demonstrated experimentally, then following the pattern of changes in the contributions of the pcs is indicative of a decrease in stability in both p <dig>  and p <dig> . when the trajectory is examined along pc <dig>  we see that motion in mutant p <dig> is mainly determined by large increases in fluctuations relative to those in the wild type. in contrast, in p <dig> and p <dig>  the wild type proteins display larger fluctuations in general. the average rmsf of cα atoms is  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   Å for p <dig>  dp <dig>  p <dig>  dp <dig>  p <dig>  dp <dig> respectively. the associated quasi-harmonic frequencies and entropies along pc <dig> and pc <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  these clearly show that the two frequencies in p <dig> increase upon mutation, leading thereby to an increase in entropy and thus stabilization of the free energy. in contrast the frequencies increase in p <dig> and p <dig>  thus leading to a decrease in the entropy and thus a destabilization of the free energy.

we further examine this through the probability of accessing regions of the phase space determined by pc <dig> and pc <dig> . this shows two features: the more stable p <dig> and p <dig> do cover a larger region of phase space, particularly along pc <dig> compared to that covered by p <dig>  in contrast, the mutants tend to show reduced coverage in p63/p <dig> and larger coverage in p <dig> compared to their wild types; in the case of p <dig> the differences are smaller than in p <dig>  so far the data suggest that if the increases in flexibility in p <dig> correlate with the experimentally observed increase in stability upon mutations, then by analogy, we expect p <dig> to undergo a decrease in stability upon mutation; in the case of p <dig> it seems that the stability decrease will not be very pronounced.

structural plasticity
we next examine stability from a somewhat different perspective. this is through an examination of the nature of the experiments that are performed to study stability. fersht's group studied stability by examining the accessibility of the proteins to increasing amounts of urea which would eventually lead to denaturation. this would require the urea molecules to penetrate to certain depths into the protein through pathways and induce unfolding  <cit> . this implies that the surfaces must be "pliable" or "penetrable" to different degrees. one method that is employed using nmr to explore such pathways is to explore the accessibility of residues to the solvent through exchange experiments while another technique, again using nmr, is to measure the timescales that characterize the rates of flipping of aromatic rings . indeed, fersht and colleagues have examined such rates to characterize the nature of the core domain of p <dig>  <cit>  and have reported a range of timescales that underlie a rich and complex dynamic behaviour. while the former method is relatively complex and beyond rigorous computational investigations, the latter can be examined using advanced techniques of simulations  <cit> . these motions are very good reporters of mobility but their timescales are far too high to be sampled in regular md simulations and hence the need for more sophisticated methods. we apply one such technique, the conjugate peak refinement method  <cit> , that we have shown can effectively reproduce experimentally observed energetic barriers to such processes  <cit> . we have carried this out for the core tyr/phe residues that are the sites of mutations; in addition we have also computed these for  <dig> tyr residues that are spread over the protein and are located towards the edges . this will enable some understanding of the nature of fluctuations that could possibly enable urea molecules to penetrate the surface of the protein. while a detailed analysis of our findings will be presented elsewhere, we summarize the key findings here.

the energies of the minimized structures are shown in table  <dig>  it is clear that these do not reflect the experimentally observed shifts in stability. we have augmented the enthalpies with a normal mode based vibrational entropy estimate and still observe the same lack of correlation with experimental stabilities. this is not surprising given that the initial structures are all derived from the one crystal structure of p <dig>  and is constrained by the multiple minima problem; we have also attempted minimizations using a variety of other continuum models  and they all show different shifts in energies and lack of correlations in trends compared to experimental data. this further highlights the importance of identifying alternative metrics that may give detailed insights into the origins of changes in stabilities.

the minimum energy pathways were computed for a set of tyr residues located at the periphery of the molecule  and those at the core in all the  <dig> systems and the barrier heights are listed in table  <dig>  the barrier to rotation of the core tyr <dig> of p <dig> is  <dig>  kcal/mol and does not change much for the tyr236phe mutation . however, when the thr is mutated to ile, the barrier for tyr <dig> reduces to  <dig>  kcal/mol and that for phe <dig> in the double mutant phe236-ile <dig> reduces to  <dig>  kcal/mol. this is linked largely to the unfavourable interactions between the polar sidechain of thr <dig> and neighbouring ile <dig> and ile <dig> . when the thr is mutated to ile, the cavity becomes apolar and the mobility that results enables the rotation of apolar phe with less impedance and hence the reduced barrier height. this suggests that the presence of thr <dig> leads to local rigidity at the core.

in contrast, the barriers for the equivalent phe in p <dig> increases almost two-fold in the mutant while in p <dig> there is actually a decrease by 30%. what is interesting is that the barriers to rotation of the phe in dp <dig> are smaller than the corresponding barriers in wtp <dig> and wtp <dig>  examining the local environment around the sites of rotation, we find that val <dig> in p <dig> is ala in p <dig> and gly in p <dig> , ie the cavity gets progressively less densely packed between p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> and there is a correlated rise in the barrier height. the other difference in the immediate neighbourhood of the rotating ring is met <dig> in p <dig> which is leu in both p <dig> and p <dig>  this suggests that packing helps to ease barriers to the complex processes of ring flips.

the barriers that the four tyr residues experience in p <dig> have increased in dp <dig>  in contrast the barriers of two tyrosines increase and those of the other two decrease in p63; in p <dig>  the barriers of three of the four tyrosines decrease. the variability in the barriers and the effects that the mutations have on them reflect the complex topography and underlying energy surface and reflects the differences in the packing in the proteins. however, tyr <dig> lies at the junction of two sub-domains that could fluctuate, thus creating pathways for the entry of small solutes such as those that cause unfolding. one subdomain is formed by the region containing loop l <dig> and the other subdomain contains loop l <dig>  one side of this region is constrained by a zn atom while the other side is packed against each other through the tyr <dig> sidechain. these are also the residues that move the most along the ring-flip reaction coordinate . we know that in p <dig> the core becomes softer as judged by the decrease in barriers to ring rotation, and the periphery becomes more rigid as judged by the increase in barriers to ring rotation. this suggests that the mutant form would make it harder for the ligand urea to penetrate through to cause unfolding, leading thereby to the observed increase in stability. again, if we extend this analogy to p <dig> where we saw that the pattern was similar to p <dig>  then, the core becomes more rigid upon mutation, while most of the periphery becomes softer and so upon mutations, it should be easier for urea molecules to penetrate the surface of p <dig> and cause destabilization than it would in the wild type. as seen in the pc analysis, it is again difficult to determine what happens in the case of p <dig>  one thing is clear and that is that the core does become more rigid, but the periphery is more variable.

discussion
in an attempt to establish a structural and energetic basis for the low stability of the dna binding domain of the tumour suppressor protein p <dig>  we have carried out computational studies of the wild type p <dig> and its homologues p <dig> and p <dig> and their double mutants. the mutations have been guided by the sequence of the homologs p <dig> and p <dig> which are known to be more stable. experimentally, the p <dig> mutant has been found to have increased stability although the biological activity is yet to be determined  <cit> . in an effort to correlate observations from simulations to experimentally observed stability issues in proteins, increasing deviation from the starting structures during the course of an md simulation and, increased positional fluctuations have both been used as evidence for destabilizing influences on a protein's structure  <cit> ). in our study however, we find that rmsd patterns do not correlate well with changing stabilities. neither do the "free energies" of the structures that we have modelled. this could reflect both on the quality of our models and/or on the limitations of the force-fields  <cit> . despite the overall similarity structurally and energetically , we have seen that the systems are not equally "stable". a double mutant constructed experimentally  <cit> , enhances the stability of p <dig>  our simulations suggest that this arises due to a net increase in fluctuations of the proteins. this would lead to an increased conformational sampling of the phase space which in turn leads to entropic stabilization of the overall free energy of the system. we see this increase when p <dig> is transformed into dp <dig>  and we know that experimentally the stability of dp <dig> is increased  <cit> . we see a decrease when p <dig> is transformed into dp <dig> ; there is no experimental data for this as yet. the pattern of changes seems to be largely determined by pc <dig> , which is the dominant mode of motion. interestingly it is known that motions along the dominant mode are quite robust to sequence variations  <cit> .

the residues that are under study here are located at the core of the protein suggesting that the increased stability in p <dig>  may arise from the removal  of buried polar groups. several groups have been investigating the links between the nature of protein cores and overall stabilities. there are reports of increased rigidity associated with increased stability from md simulations  <cit> . lim and colleagues  <cit>  report agreement between the md simulations and the antibody-related observations on the nature of mutant structures; they also report agreement with the experimental observations of the change in dna binding activity of some mutants. our own observations suggest that enhanced sampling of phase space is linked to increased stability. this issue is as yet unresolved. the effects of core residue modifications upon protein stability remain unresolved. some studies point out that burying polar groups increases the packing densities of proteins which in turn have a favourable effect on protein stability  <cit> . other work has also concluded that burying polar groups leads to increased entropic stabilizations  <cit> . in contrast, there is other evidence that burying polar group can also destabilize proteins  <cit> . the observation by lane & colleagues  <cit>  that mutations of several surface residues of the dna binding domain of p <dig> can have remarkable effects on its stability further highlights the complex nature of the stability issue. the picture is made more complex by observations that certain mutations at the cores of proteins lead to rearrangements that cause partial collapse to offset the size changes and minimize free energies, while in some cases, rearrangements expose polar groups that then attract solvent water from the bulk  <cit> . matthews & colleagues  <cit>  suggest that the landscape underlying such changes is characterized by a complex interaction between fluid like sidechain motions and more rigid peptide backbone motions. clearly while there is some correlation between core rigidity, packing and overall stability, the issue seems to be far more complex and requires further detailed investigations  <cit> .

proteins are complex systems and while the nature of core residues will certainly dominate the overall rigidity, stability is a global property and there will be several other factors that contribute, as has been highlighted for the dna binding domain of p <dig> by lane & colleagues  <cit> . our own simulations do point out certain features that seem to be consistent with experimental observations indirectly: the fluctuations of the helical segment that is part of loop l <dig>  only for p <dig> and p <dig>  the importance of helix h <dig> in both p <dig> and p <dig> in dna binding has been reported  <cit> . if we look at figure  <dig>  we notice that this region is the one that is involved in the protein-protein dimeric interface thereby hinting at the importance perhaps of dimerization and cooperativity in dna binding  <cit> .

in an attempt to understand the root of stability changes in a somewhat different manner, we examined in detail the experiments that have been used to probe stability. these experiments are related to the amount of urea needed to unfold a protein. this requires an understanding of the dynamics of parts of the protein which will form the pathways of entry of urea to the core of the protein  <cit> . while an exhaustive understanding of the various pathways is not available, we begin the process by examining the mobilities at various locations on the protein surface by computing the energetic barriers that characterize ring flips; such flips cause sufficient local deformation to enable openings for solvent molecules to enter the protein . while it is hard to estimate the rates of the processes associated with these ring flips as we have no entropic estimates of the transition states , it is clear from our studies here that  the rate at the core increases with increasing stability of the protein;  a range of time scales characterize the dynamics of the various parts of the protein;  the motions at the surface are very local and uncoupled from each other  <cit> .

the residues that differ in the neighbourhood of the tyr rings are:  for tyr126: pro <dig> in p <dig> and p <dig> is replaced by thr <dig> in p63; asn <dig> in p <dig> is replaced by lys <dig> in p <dig> and p73;  for tyr163: glu <dig> in p <dig> and p <dig> is replaced by asp171;  for tyr205: val <dig> in p <dig> is replaced by ala <dig> in p <dig> and val <dig> in p73;  there is a complex interplay of varying timescale motions across the protein surface; while the double mutant of p <dig> witnesses a dramatic reduction in the rate of flipping of the core aromatic sidechain, suggestive of increasing softness of the protein, the effects on residues that are towards the periphery  in p <dig> are one of increasing the barriers to transitions – suggestive of increase in local packing or decreasing "softness". it is clear that small changes in the immediate environments of the rotating rings can affect the local packing in a manner that is reflected in the wide range of barrier heights. this does suggest that despite the fact that the ring flip itself is largely governed by local effects, somehow there are more global influences of the mutations that result in some "tighter" peripheral spots. this may form the basis of the need for larger amounts of urea needed to penetrate through the protein leading to the observed increase in stability. additionally, two of the rings that we have studied, tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> are located in the vicinity of the dna binding and the dimerization surfaces. analyses of the ring flips and the associated movements clearly show motions that are likely to influence both these interactions . it is clear that plasticity of the core residues is communicated to the dynamics of residues at the periphery. these will include those that mediate binding to dna. how exactly this happens remains to be uncovered.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we find that computational estimates of stability of proteins through their minimized energies partially reproduce experimental trends and may thus be a reasonable metric. differences in root mean squared deviations over the course of md simulations do provide some hints at changes in stability, as observed by pan et al.  <cit> ; however in our studies, this metric is not entirely discriminating. in our simulations, the enhanced sampling of phase space, dominated by motion along pc <dig>  seems to be responsible for increasing stability. in addition, we have, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, applied methods of activated dynamics to understand protein stability as defined by urea induced unfolding. the mobility at the core of the protein is increased in systems of larger mobility as evidenced from higher rates of ring flips of aromatic residues; this suggests that larger conformational sampling increases the softness of the protein core, thereby making it more robust to structural perturbations. this seems to arise from a change of directed polar interactions to nondirectional apolar interactions. we find that the changes in mobility in surface regions of the protein and access to urea molecules correlates well with changing stabilities in p <dig> and perhaps in p <dig>  while we do not yet have a measure of transforming these results into quantitative differences between experimental stabilities, we are applying this method to a range of other p <dig> mutants and other proteins to examine its validity and robustness. initial results suggest that the method seems to hold the potential to rapidly estimate, at least qualitatively, the effects on the stability of proteins . if more generally valid, this method may well reduce the number of experiments that need to be carried out to examine the effects of mutagenesis on the stabilities, at least of a class of proteins, and would be an additional tool in protein design strategies.

a concluding point is about the two different force fields used in our analysis. we started the study using amber. however as pointed out, at the end of the md study, we decided to expand the investigations by using methods of reaction paths  in order to explore the origins of stability as measured by urea-induced unfolding. these algorithms currently are only available in charmm. however the general differences amongst different force fields is quite small, as has been pointed out in a recent study  <cit>  leading us to conclude that had we conducted our simulations using charmm, the overall conclusions would have been similar to those that we have reported using amber.
