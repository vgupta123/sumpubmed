BACKGROUND
there are an estimated  <dig> site-specific dna binding factors encoded in the human genome  <cit> . although these factors can influence transcription when their binding sites are cloned in front of core promoters, they usually do not function alone. most often, individual transcription factors collaborate to orchestrate gene expression through combinatorial binding to regulatory regions in chromatin  <cit> . these regions, termed cis modules, thereby activate, repress or otherwise epigenetically modify the transcriptional responses of individual genes. elucidating the position and activities of individual cis modules using reporter genes is time consuming and expensive. with recent advances in dna sequencing technology, it is now feasible to generate global protein-dna interaction profiles by chromatin immunoprecipitation  followed by ultra-high-throughput sequencing  <cit> . cis modules can then often be identified by applying bioinformatics searches for one or more cis motifs recognized by unrelated alternative factors near the binding sites of the factor analyzed by chip-seq or by the co-localization of bound sites for two or more unrelated different site-specific factors.

nuclear receptors  represent a special class of transcription factors that direct target gene transcription in a ligand-dependent fashion. nrs contain a dna-binding domain that recognizes a specific dna sequence, as well as a ligand binding domain that renders these factors environmentally-dependent regulators via interaction with distinct cognate ligands  <cit> . the great majority of nrs homodimerize or heterodimerize with another nr, and then bind to two copies of a repeated hexanucleotide sequence  separated by variable spacing  <cit> . the half-site consensus, aggtca, can occur in either orientation and variation from the consensus allows numerous alternative binding sites of  variable affinity  <cit> . based on the number of spacer nucleotides separating the two half-sites and the orientation of the two half-sites relative to each other, nr binding sites have been categorized as direct repeats , everted repeats  or inverted repeats   <cit> .

nr2c <dig>  belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and is termed an orphan receptor due to the fact that no ligand has been discovered  <cit> . tr <dig> was initially identified in hypothalamus, prostate, and testis cdna libraries, but has since been demonstrated to be broadly expressed in many physiological systems  <cit> . for example, tr <dig> has been shown to activate target gene expression in liver carcinoma hepg <dig> cells  <cit> . in contrast, in erythroid cells, tr <dig> can heterodimerize with another closely related family member  and binds to a dr <dig>  element to repress target gene transcription  <cit> . the binding affinity of the tr <dig> homodimer for the dr <dig> element in vitro is equivalent to that of the tr2:tr <dig> heterodimer  <cit> , and tr <dig> mrna is more abundant than tr <dig> in human erythroid cells . however, the broader physiological functions for, and the in vivo genome-wide binding patterns of, this broadly expressed nuclear receptor are obscure. we therefore chose to initially investigate genome wide tr <dig> binding anticipating that these studies might reveal some common, but also perhaps some tissue-specific, metabolic processes to which this factor contributes.

in this study we investigated the first genome-wide identification of cellular targets of tr <dig> and preliminary characterization of tr <dig> in vivo binding in multiple cell types, including those in which tr <dig> has been suggested to be an activator  and cells in which tr <dig> has been suggested to be a repressor . using chip-seq, we determined tr <dig> in vivo binding in four human encode cell lines: k <dig> erythroleukemia cells, hepg <dig> liver carcinoma, hela cervical carcinoma, and gm <dig> immortalized lymphoblast cells. tr <dig> binding patterns identified in the four diverse cell lines suggest that this factor controls cell metabolism by binding to the proximal promoter regions that are common to several hundred genes. motif analysis shows that tr <dig> strongly prefers a dr <dig> sequence to all other categories of repeat elements in vivo. by integration of tr <dig> binding data with histone modification patterns and other genomic structures, we predict, and then experimentally test, putative cis modules.

RESULTS
identification of genome-wide tr <dig> binding sites
with no known ligand and few proposed binding sites in mouse and human cell lines  <cit> , the function of the tr <dig> orphan nuclear receptor was largely unknown when we began these studies. previous studies examined its function in different blood cells and found that tr <dig> bound to the cd <dig> promoter in macrophages  <cit>  and to the gata <dig> enhancer g1he  <cit>  in cd34+ cells, but only after in vitro differentiation for  <dig> days. to further elucidate biological roles for tr <dig>  we set out to identify in vivo tr <dig> binding sites throughout the entire human genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing . we wanted to compare its binding profiles in cells derived from different tissue types. we chose to identify tr <dig> targets in cell types selected by the encode consortium , including human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells , human cervical carcinoma cells , lymphoblastoid cells , and hepatocellular carcinoma cells . by characterizing its binding in these cell lines, we could compare tr <dig> binding sites with other transcription factor binding sites and histone marks determined by other encode groups examining these same cell types. we first validated the presence of tr <dig> protein in these cell lines by western blot analysis . we began our chip experiments using the hematopoietic cell line k <dig> and the liver cell line hepg <dig>  but were unable to confirm tr <dig> enrichment at targets previously published in the specialized and differentiated hematopoietic cells. therefore, we initially proceeded without having positive controls for the chip assays. we prepared sequencing libraries from chip experiments from two independently grown batches of hepg <dig> cells. samples were sequenced using the illumina ga <dig> platform and chip-seq data were analyzed using the sole-search software . only sequences that uniquely matched those in the human genome were retained for analysis.  <dig>  million sequence reads were obtained from replicate  <dig> and  <dig>  million from replicate  <dig>  using the sole-search peak calling program with default settings ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  tr <dig> binding sites were identified in hepg <dig> cells for replicate  <dig> and replicate  <dig>  respectively.  <dig>   of the  <dig>  peaks called from replicate  <dig> were also present in the  <dig>  peaks called from replicate  <dig>  this overlap demonstrates good reproducibility between biological replicates. to obtain the final list of  <dig>  tr <dig> binding sites in hepg <dig> cells, all reads  from both biological replicates were merged. we then performed tr <dig> chip experiments for the other cell types and used standard pcr to confirm enrichment at three sites  previously identified in hepg <dig> cells . chip-seq libraries were then prepared from two biological replicates using the tr <dig> antibody resulting in  <dig> million sequence reads for hela cells,  <dig> million for gm <dig> cells and  <dig> million for k <dig> cells .  <dig>  tr <dig> binding sites were identified in hela cells,  <dig>  tr <dig> binding sites in gm <dig> cells and  <dig> tr <dig> binding sites in k <dig> cells; see figure  <dig> for the binding patterns of tr <dig> across the entire chromosome  <dig> in all four cell types.

the position to which a transcription factor binds relative to the start site of transcription can provide insight into how the factor regulates transcription. for example, e2f family members bind to core promoter regions and are thought to stimulate transcription by interaction with the basal transcription machinery  <cit> . in contrast, other transcription factors, such as gata <dig> or tcf <dig> , show significant binding to sites often located more than  <dig> kb away from the gene that they regulate  <cit> , suggesting that these factors may regulate transcription by looping mechanisms. although the number of tr <dig> binding sites varied among the different cell types, location analysis revealed that tr <dig> preferentially binds close to the transcription start sites of its target genes. the majority of tr <dig> binding sites  is located either in the proximal promoter  or is found within the first exon or first intron of a refseq gene. in hela cells, 36% of tr <dig> binding occurred in the proximal promoter and 41% in the gene region, mainly in the first exon or first intron . to further characterize tr <dig> binding sites, tr <dig> chip-seq reads were organized into  <dig> bp bins relative to the start site of transcription. the distribution of tr <dig> peaks relative to the transcription start site demonstrated that the majority of tr <dig> binding occurs between  <dig> kb upstream and  <dig> kb downstream of a tss . for example,  <dig>   of the  <dig>  hela binding sites were located within ±  <dig> kb from a tss . this preference was also reflected in an elevated median height of peaks near a tss; the median peak value was  <dig> for peaks within ±  <dig> kb of a tss, but only  <dig> for peaks outside this range. for the rest of our studies, we therefore focused on the targets found within  <dig> kb of a tss. this encompassed  <dig>  tr <dig> binding sites for hela,  <dig>  for hepg <dig>   <dig> for k <dig> and  <dig> for gm <dig> cells.

a significant fraction of tr <dig> binding sites was shared among cell types . for example, out of the  <dig> tr <dig> binding sites in k <dig> cells,  <dig>  are also occupied in hela cells,  <dig>  are also bound in hepg <dig> cells and  <dig>  are also bound in gm <dig> cells. when comparing  <dig>  tr <dig> binding sites from hela with  <dig>  from hepg <dig> cells, we found  <dig>  were shared tr <dig> target sites. we next matched the tr <dig> peaks to the nearest gene. in some cases more than one peak matched to a given gene. as a consequence, the number of tr <dig> binding sites is slightly higher than the number of target genes. we compared  <dig>  tr <dig> target genes from hela,  <dig> from k <dig>   <dig> from gm <dig> and  <dig>  from hepg <dig> cells .  <dig> target genes were shared in at least  <dig> cell types and  <dig> target genes were shared among all four cell types. while blood cells shared most of their tr <dig> targets, liver cells contained the largest number of unique target genes. tr <dig> may regulate genes important for basic biological processes shared in multiple cell types, while it may play an additional role in regulating cell type specific genes.

tr <dig> target genes are involved in fundamental biological processes
as shown above, the majority of tr <dig> targets are shared between different cell types. to shed light on the common function of genes targeted by tr <dig>  gene ontology analysis was performed using conceptgen  to identify the functional categories enriched in the overlapping targets in  <dig> cell types . all entrez genes were used as background to determine the significance of over-representation. categories of tr <dig> target genes are highly enriched in fundamental biological processes, such as rna metabolism and protein translation  . in addition, tr <dig> may also regulate cell type-specific genes. to test this hypothesis, we performed gene ontology analysis on genes found in only one cell type. the number of unique target genes in k <dig>  hela, and gm <dig> cells was not sufficient to perform meaningful gene ontology analysis. however when  <dig> tr <dig> target genes specific to hepg <dig> cells were analyzed, we found some unique functional categories . hepg <dig> specific target genes were significantly enriched for ubiquitin cycle, nucleosome, chromatin assembly and metabolic processes, particularly those involving organic acid, carbohydrates, and lipids. interestingly, a few previous studies have suggested a role for tr <dig> in gluconeogenesis  <cit> . furthermore, tr <dig> may exert its function by sensing lipids and the presence of fatty acids was found to enhance cofactor recruitment to tr <dig>  <cit>  suggesting an important role for lipids in tr <dig> function.

in recent years it has become evident that transcription factors often play dual roles, affecting activation as well as repression of target genes. previous studies have implicated tr <dig> in both activation and repression of cellular target genes  <cit> . tr <dig> binds to dna as a homodimer, but preferentially forms heterodimers with the orphan receptor tr <dig>  <cit> . recently, a global atlas for transcription factor networks has been assembled based on physical protein-protein interactions using mammalian two hybrid data  <cit> . this study identified tr <dig> , nuclear receptor interacting protein  <dig> nrip <dig> , and histone deacetylases hdac  <dig> and hdac <dig> as proteins interacting with tr <dig> . nrip <dig> may function as a corepressor or coactivator depending on the interacting protein  <cit> . furthermore, post translational modifications of tr <dig> influence its interaction with cofactors  <cit> . phosphorylation of tr <dig> is accomplished by map kinases and results in recruitment of nrip <dig>  on the other hand, dephosphorylated tr <dig> recruits the coactivator pcaf. we wanted to determine whether tr <dig> target genes are expressed or silenced. for this purpose, we matched tr <dig> target genes in hela and hepg <dig> cells  to their rna expression values from illumina expression arrays . the median expression value of tr <dig> target genes in hela and hepg <dig> cells  is higher than the median expression value of all genes from the hepg <dig> expression array . tr <dig> target genes are also expressed at higher levels than a set of  <dig> randomly selected genes from the hepg <dig> expression array . based on rna expression analysis, tr <dig> target genes are generally expressed.

the correlation between tr <dig> binding and expression of target genes suggests that tr <dig> binds to open accessible chromatin regions. to test this hypothesis, we examined the epigenetic signature at tr <dig> binding sites using chip-seq data of various histone marks in k <dig> cells. overlap of tr <dig> binding sites with histone marks typical for open and repressed chromatin was determined using the gffoverlap tool from sole-search . a distance of  <dig> base pairs between peaks was allowed to take nucleosome positioning into account. a remarkable  <dig> of the  <dig> tr <dig> target sites in k <dig> cells were also occupied by h3k4me <dig>  which is a mark for accessible chromatin. no significant overlap with the repressive chromatin marks h3k27me <dig> or h3k9me <dig> was found . it has been shown in yeast and also human cells that transcription factors often bind in the linker region between nucleosomes  <cit> . to determine whether tr <dig> binding occurs in nucleosome depleted regions, we analyzed sequence tag density for tr <dig> and h3k4me <dig> binding relative to the transcription start sites . tr <dig> binding was highest within  <dig> base pairs upstream of the tss while the histone mark h3k4me <dig> is lowest in this region and reaching maximum where tr <dig> binding tails off, suggesting predisposition of tr <dig> binding sites to the linker region.

motif analysis suggests the importance of ets family members in tr <dig> action
in vitro experiments have shown that tr <dig> binds to the direct repeat  of aggtca, which is the consensus binding site for a number of nuclear hormone receptors including estrogen receptor alpha and ppar. further studies have indicated that tr <dig> can bind to direct repeats separated by zero to five nucleotides   <cit> . however, all previous studies were performed using in vitro assays. we used the de novo motif discovery program meme to identify motifs overrepresented in tr <dig> binding sites to determine if tr <dig> has the same specificity in vivo. to allow identification of dr elements and its spacing and flanking nucleotides, the minimum motif length was set between  <dig>  and  <dig> nucleotides . the canonical dr motif with one nucleotide spacing  was significantly overrepresented in all four cell types with the preferred spacing nucleotide being an a or g . the canonical dr <dig> motif accounts for about  <dig> tr <dig> binding sites . interestingly, the % of peaks having a dr <dig> motif is much higher in the blood cell lines  than in the other two cell types. the lack of the dr <dig> motif in the remaining peaks may indicate that tr <dig> associates with some sites only indirectly by binding to a different transcription factor.

transcription factors often regulate expression of nearby genes in combination with other transcription factors through complex cis regulatory modules  <cit> . our initial motif analysis revealed the significant recurrence of an ets motif in addition to the dr <dig> element. members of the ets transcription factor family such as elk <dig>  e74a, and gabpa recognize the ets core motif ggaa. using  <dig>  human promoter sequences, the ets motif has been identified as one of those motifs exhibiting statistically significant clustering near the transcription start site  <cit> . the ets motif was predominantly found in the promoters of genes with essential cellular functions, such as ribosomal genes, mitochondrial ribosomal genes, basal transcription factor genes and proteosomal genes. the ets motif is not only found at genes regulating similar processes as tr <dig> target genes, but also preferentially occurs  <dig> base pairs upstream of a transcription start site. the ets motif occurs in a significant portion of tr <dig> binding sites . only about 10% of target genes contain both the dr <dig> and the ets motif . combining both motifs can account for 67-78% of tr <dig> peaks  suggesting a combinatorial role for ets family members in tr <dig> function. similar results were obtained using other de novo motif discovery programs such as nhr-scan  <cit>  and w-chipmotifs  <cit> .

it has been postulated that the true binding site for transcription factors should be located under the center of the peak  <cit> . we analyzed the distribution of both motifs relative to the center of the tr <dig> binding sites and found that the dr <dig> as well as the ets motif are located under the peak center . the close proximity of these binding sites suggests a cis regulatory network involving tr <dig> and ets family members.

ets transcription factor elk <dig> co-occupies tr <dig> target sites
we wanted to test the hypothesis that tr <dig> and a member of the ets family co-localize with tr <dig> in vivo using chip-seq. motif analysis implicates the ets family, but does not provide information as to which family member might bind to tr <dig> target sites. there is a high degree of functional redundancy between different members of the ets transcription factors. comparison of elk <dig> and gabpa binding regions revealed redundant as well as unique targets between the two ets family members  <cit> . it has also been shown that ets transcription factors interact with other transcription factors to regulate gene expression. for example, elk <dig> is thought to function through cooperation with the serum response factor srf  <cit> . chip-chip analysis showed that 22% of all elk <dig> binding regions were also bound by srf, while the majority of elk <dig> targets is srf-independent.

to explore the possibility that ets transcription factors might cooperate with tr <dig>  we performed chip-seq analysis of elk <dig> as well as elk <dig> in hela cells and binding sites were determined using sole-search.  <dig>  elk <dig> peaks were identified from  <dig> million reads and  <dig> elk <dig> peaks were identified from  <dig> million reads, with 86% of the elk <dig> sites also being elk <dig> binding sites . when we compared the  <dig>  tr <dig> targets present within  <dig> kb of a tss with  <dig>  elk <dig> targets found within  <dig> kb of a tss, a significant overlap of 30% was observed . to identify the motifs utilized for tr <dig> recruitment at the  <dig> tr <dig> binding sites that are also occupied by elk <dig>  we performed motif analysis using meme. the ets motif was highly overrepresented , while the dr <dig> motif was not  . we have thus identified a tr4-elk <dig> cis module that accounts for 30% of tr <dig> binding sites. these sites are characterized by overrepresentation of the ets motif in 96% of the sites and the lack of a dr <dig> element typically thought to recruit tr <dig>  therefore, tr <dig> does not directly bind to dna via a dr <dig> element at these sites, but appears to be recruited through an ets factor. we also analyzed the localization of binding relative to gene structure and found that tr <dig> and elk <dig> display very similar patterns, with maximum binding between  <dig> bp upstream and downstream of a transcription start site . the occurrence of both factors at common binding sites was confirmed by quantitative pcr using independent biological replicates . although we experimentally identified a cis regulatory module involving elk <dig> at ~30% of tr <dig> binding sites, the ets core motif was identified using bioinformatics to be within 53% of tr <dig> binding regions. it is possible that other ets family members occupy these sites. it has been shown that the ets family members elk and gabpa shared half of their binding sites, while the other half were specific for a particular ets factor  <cit> . although further studies are needed, it is possible that elk <dig> facilitates tr <dig> binding to promoter regions that do not contain the dr <dig> motif, suggesting the presence of elk <dig> dependent and elk <dig> independent modes of tr <dig> action .

CONCLUSIONS
while it had been established that tr <dig> plays a critical role in embryonic development, differentiation and lipid metabolism, the modes by which it functions were previously unclear. to obtain a better understanding of the tr <dig> modes of action, we used chip-seq technology to identify tr <dig> target genes in vivo in multiple cell lines. this allowed us to confirm tr <dig> binding in vivo to the direct repeat of aggtca separated by one nucleotide  at endogenous target sites in all four cell types examined. using de novo motif discovery, we found that the ets motif ccggaa was significantly overrepresented in tr <dig> binding sites, suggesting a role for ets family members in tr <dig> action. to confirm the co-occurrence of these two factors in vivo, we performed chip-seq for the ets transcription factor elk <dig> and we found that about one third of tr <dig> target sites were indeed bound by elk <dig>  sites that are bound by both factors contain an ets motif, but lack the dr <dig> element typically thought to recruit tr <dig>  these data suggest that tr <dig> may regulate specific subsets of target genes through ets dependent as well as ets independent pathways. future studies will focus on the interdependence of these two transcription factors. thus our approach of defining genome-wide binding patterns for a factor, followed by motif analysis to suggest possible cis modules, and then genome-wide analysis of the putative co-localizing factor has worked well to identify a tr4-elk <dig> cis module.

interestingly, we identified tr <dig> target genes that are common to quite diverse cell types . these genes were involved in fundamental biological processes such as rna metabolism and protein translation. in addition, tr <dig> also binds near genes that are highly cell type-specific. for example, in hepg <dig> cells tr <dig> binds near genes that are involved in organic acid, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. tr <dig> knockout mice show insulin hypersensitivity  <cit>  and tr <dig> can be induced by certain essential fatty acids resulting in tr <dig> activation followed by the up-regulation of the apolipoprotein e precursor  and cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  <dig> pepck gene  <cit> , which is thought to contribute to diabetics-induced hyperglycemia  <cit> . knowing the direct tr <dig> binding sites, it will be an interesting focus of future studies to evaluate the pathways underlying tr <dig> action and its possible role in metabolic diseases.
