BACKGROUND
a group of non-coding small rnas  plays an important role in transcript regulation by binding to their target sequences, resulting in transcriptional degradation, transcriptional or translational inhibition of the targets
 <cit> . the smrnas are classified into two major classes: micrornas , and small interfering rnas . primary transcripts of mirnas are processed into precursors of mirnas that form secondary stem-and-loop structures, which are processed by the ribonuclease dicer-like  <dig>  into mirna/mirna* duplexes, which are subsequently incorporated into the rna induced silencing complex 
 <cit> . the sirnas are further classified into trans acting sirnas , chromatin-associated cis acting sirnas, and natural antisense sirnas, based on their biogenesis
 <cit> . biogenesis of tasirnas is regulated by mirnas, which direct cleavage of primary tasirna  transcripts encoding tasirnas, resulting in second-strand rna synthesis by rna-dependent rna polymerases . the double-stranded rnas are diced by dcl <dig> to generate tasirnas in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> .

plant mirnas and sirnas are involved in several developmental processes
 <cit> : embryogenesis
 <cit> , organ polarity
 <cit> , leaf formation
 <cit> , root development
 <cit> , phytohormone signaling
 <cit> , and flowering time
 <cit> . plant defense signaling is also regulated by mirnas in response to different abiotic stresses
 <cit>  including heat, cold, drought
 <cit> , and uv-b radiation
 <cit> . for example, a. thaliana mir <dig> , induced during phosphate starvation, targets the ubiquitin-conjugating e <dig> enzyme involved in phosphate uptake from the soil
 <cit> . under drought stress, ath-mir <dig> regulates myb <dig> and myb <dig> transcription factors, which activate abscisic acid responses during seed germination
 <cit> . ath-mir <dig> regulates cu/zn-superoxide dismutase genes, which detoxify superoxide radicals
 <cit> . a recent study reported that several mirnas are induced upon mechanical wounding in tobacco leaves and roots
 <cit> .

plant mirnas are also involved in biotic interactions. ath-mir <dig> is induced by flagellin-derived pamp peptide  <dig>  and targets the f-box protein and transport inhibitor response  <dig>  which plays a key role in antibacterial responses
 <cit> . ath-mir <dig>  ath-mir <dig>  and ath-mir <dig> are induced in response to infection by pst dc <dig> hrcc
 <cit> , and a. thaliana and nicotiana tabacum plants infected by tymvp <dig> virus accumulate high levels of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir164
 <cit> . plant mirnas are also involved in beneficial interactions with bacteria: mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> play a role during rhizobial infection in glycine max nodulation with bradyrhizobium japonicum <cit> . however, little is known about the role of plant mirnas in the response to insect herbivores.

the wild tobacco nicotiana attenuata and its herbivore community have become an ecological model system for the study of plant-herbivore interactions. during attack by insect herbivores, n. attenuata rapidly induces jasmonate-mediated defense responses, which reconfigure primary and secondary metabolism
 <cit> . jasmonates comprise jasmonic acid , its derivatives and conjugates; the jasmonates and in particular, the active hormone jasmonoyl-isoleucine  regulate most defenses against chewing herbivores
 <cit> . fatty acid amino acid conjugates  in oral secretion  from larvae of the specialist herbivore, manduca sexta, trigger jasmonate-mediated direct and indirect defenses in n. attenuata, such as nicotine accumulation, proteinase inhibitor production, diterpene glycoside biosynthesis, and emission of green leaf volatiles
 <cit> . transgenic plants impaired in jasmonate biosynthesis or signaling show increased susceptibility to herbivory in both glasshouse and field studies
 <cit> .

os-elicitation dramatically changes the smrna population in n. attenuata <cit> , and two major components of the smrna pathway, rdrs and dcl proteins, function in biotic and abiotic stress responses
 <cit> . silencing of n. attenuata rdr <dig>  dcl <dig>  and dcl <dig> results in impaired defense responses against m. sexta herbivory
 <cit> . silencing either nardr <dig> or nadcl <dig> impairs jasmonic acid  accumulation, and co-silencing nadcl <dig> and nadcl <dig> reduces ja levels, indicating that rdr1/dcl4-mediated smrnas are critical regulators of responses to insect herbivory.

to deepen our understanding of the roles that smrnas play in plant-insect interactions, we identified primary mirna  transcripts and tas transcripts encoding tasirnas in a transcriptome database of n. attenuata <cit> , and computationally analyzed secondary stem-and-loop structures of mir transcripts. to understand the role of jasmonates in regulating mirnas, we examined mirna accumulation in jasmonate-deficient allene oxide cyclase  rnai lines. the aoc protein provides a precursor for ja biosynthesis
 <cit> . expression analysis of mirnas and tasirnas with their putative target genes provides evidence for a key role of plant smrnas in the response to herbivory.

RESULTS
identification of conserved mirnas and their precursors in n. attenuata
to identify conserved mirnas in n. attenuata, we used a 454-transcriptome database of n. attenuata to conduct a blast search against conserved plant mirnas in the mirbase  . this search identified  <dig> potential mirnas distributed in  <dig> families . we used the blastx algorithm against the ncbi protein database to check that the putative primary transcripts of mirnas were non-coding. web-based mfold software  was used to predict secondary stem-and-loop structures. of the identified mirna-precursors,  <dig> had stem-and-loop structures , which were created with minimum free energies  ranging from Δg = − <dig>  kcal mol- <dig> to − <dig>  kcal mol- <dig>  with an average mfe of − <dig>  kcal mol- <dig>  this average mfe is comparable to that found in a. thaliana , higher than in the red alga porphyra yezoensis  and lower than in the monocots rice  and wheat 
 <cit> . only seven predicted mirna-precursors transcripts did not form stem-and-loop structures or were not stable . we identified several n. attenuata  mirna families  which were not reported in n. tabaccum <cit> . among these, nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  and nat-mir5281are absent in a. thaliana but are close homologues to those in other plant species .

next, we designed probes to detect n. attenuata mirnas on rna blots . we performed northern blot hybridization using  <dig> μg of total rna extracted from rosette leaves to detect selected mirnas. accumulation of mirnas varied . accumulation of nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  and nat-mir <dig> was high compared to nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  and nat-mir <dig> in leaves from rosette-stage plants. for further analyses of precursor and mature mirna abundance, we used real-time quantitative pcr  with specific primer sets .

identification of conserved tasirnas in n. attenuata
four families of endogenous tasirnas  identified in a. thaliana are regulated by mirnas
 <cit> . we found three tas <dig> transcripts and one tas <dig> transcript in n. attenuata , and constructed a phylogenetic tree with their homologs from different plant species to examine the evolutionary relationships of tas <dig> expressed in dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant species
 <cit> . not surprisingly, natas <dig> members were grouped amongst members of the dicotyledonous plant species .

because tas <dig> and tas <dig> transcripts contain the binding sites of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively
 <cit> , we blasted nat-mir <dig> and nat-mir <dig> against the tas transcripts , and compared the n. attenuata tasirnas with those in a. thaliana . sequence analysis indicated that binding sites of mirna and tasirna sequences are highly conserved in n. attenuata and a. thaliana.

wound- and os-inducible mirnas
next, we examined the abundance of mirnas and their target genes in leaves of rosette-stage wt plants changed after wounding and the application of diluted m. sexta os  or water to wounds  versus no treatment  . w+os treatment faithfully mimics the majority of responses elicited by m. sexta feeding
 <cit> , but has the distinct advantage of allowing the time of elicitation to be precisely controlled  and hence greatly increases the reproducibility of transcriptional analyses.
 <dig> 

the abundance of mature nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  and nat-mir <dig> increased after both w+w and w+os treatments, abundances of which did not differ . we categorized these mirnas wound-inducible mirnas. twelve conserved mirna families  were significantly increased in w+os treated leaves compared to control and w+w treated leaves  and these were classified as os-inducible mirnas.

it is well-established that mirnas and tasirnas bind to their target mrnas by perfect or imperfect complementarity
 <cit> . such complementarity permits the identification of mirna targets in databases. we blasted mirna sequences against an in-house transriptomic database using blastn algorithms with default parameters allowing 1– <dig> mistmatches. we identified  <dig> potential targets, inluding targets of tasirnas .

ath-mir <dig> is known to negatively regulate ore1/nac <dig> transcription factors which are involved in age-dependent senescence
 <cit>  and mutations in ore1/nac <dig> delays chlorophyll loss in old leaves of a. thaliana <cit> . we found a nac transcription factor containing a nat-mir <dig> binding site in n. attenuata . the nac transcripts were significantly reduced in w+w and w+os elicited leaves , which correlated with elevated nat-mir <dig> levels after os-elicitation . this result may explain how m. sexta attack delays senescence in n. attenuata <cit> .

in addition, arf <dig> and arf <dig> were putative targets of wound-inducible nat-mir <dig>  and their transcripts decreased concurrently with the accumulation of nat-mir <dig> . potential targets of os-inducible nat-mir <dig>  gras domain transcription factors, were down-regulated in os-elicited plants . transcripts of several os-inducible nat-mir <dig> targets annotated as squamosa promoter binding proteins  were significantly down-regulated after w+os treatment. abundance of nat-mir <dig> increased significantly in w+os treated leaves  and consistently, transcripts of its putative targets, ap2-like proteins, were significantly down-regulated in w+w and w+os treated leaves .

the most significant change in mirna transcripts after w+os treatment was for nat-mir <dig>  which showed a 75-fold increase compared to control leaves and a 30-fold increase compared to w+w treated leaves . ath-mir <dig> cleaves tas transcripts, resulting in production of tasirna <dig> mediated by the rdr6/dcl <dig> complex
 <cit> . tasirna <dig> controls the transcription of auxin response factors   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which regulate leaf morphology and lateral root growth in a. thaliana <cit> . overexpression of tas <dig> leads to an increased number of lateral roots, and the knock-out mutant shows impaired lateral root growth
 <cit> . abundance of mature nat-tasirna <dig> in w+os treated leaves was increased  and nat-tasirna <dig> was regulated in a ja-independent manner . the targets of tasirna <dig>  transcripts homologous to a. thaliana arf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were significantly reduced after w+os elicitation , suggesting that nat-mir <dig> could affect the architecture of roots and thereby regulate the production of nicotine, which is synthesized in the roots, or promote tolerance of herbivory by increasing mineral uptake or sugar storage in roots. our previous study shows that silencing nadcl <dig>  which in turn reduces the accumulation of tasirna <dig>  dramatically impairs root growth and nicotine accumulation in n. attenuata <cit> . we validated the microarray data by qpcr analysis , and the result showed similar expression patterns .

ja-dependent mirnas
the key role of jasmonates in mediating responses to herbivory is well established and it was not surprising to find that the levels of jasmonates dramatically increased in w+os treated leaves compared to w+w treatment 
 <cit> . silencing of naaoc reduces ja accumulation in w+os treated leaves by 90-100%  and is known to silence the production of ja-mediated defenses
 <cit> . os-elicitation of this genotype allowed us to understand which mirnas are regulated by jasmonates.

abundance of  <dig> mirnas  increased after w+w and w+os treatments, but did not differ between wt and ir-aoc plants . we considered these mirnas as ja-independent mirnas. the abundance of nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  nat-mir <dig>  and nat-mir <dig> were significantly higher in both control and w+os elicited leaves of ir-aoc than of wt plants , indicating that jasmonates or ja-signaling negatively influences levels of these mirnas, regardless of treatment. nat-mir <dig> abundance was higher in ir-aoc only after w+os treatment . while abundance of nat-mir <dig> and nat-mir <dig> were induced by w+os treatment in wt , they were not induced by w+os treatment in ir-aoc plants . we considered these as os-inducible ja-dependent mirnas. wound-inducible nat-mir <dig> was induced in both w+w and w+os treatments in wt , but their levels were not dramatically induced in elicited ja-deficient ir-aoc plant compared to wt .

one main target of mir <dig> in a. thaliana is tcp  transcription factors, which positively regulates jasmonate biosynthesis
 <cit> . the tcp <dig> protein can bind a promoter of lipoxygenase <dig>  in a. thaliana <cit> . we do not yet know the orthologs of a. thaliana tcps in n. attenuata, but the timing of nat-mir <dig> induction was similar with that of w+os elicited ja accumulation and the induction of nalox <dig>  which is the functional homolog of a. thaliana lox <dig> <cit> . w+os treatment amplifies the wound-induced ja accumulation 
 <cit>  and does the same for nat-mir <dig> . this suggests that nat-mir <dig> could play a role in the fine-tuning regulation of jasmonate biosynthesis
 <cit>  during herbivory.

nat-mir <dig> and nat-tasirna <dig> were increased by w+w and w+os treatments in wt , but not in ir-aoc plants . levels of nat-mir <dig> dramatically decreased in ir-aoc plants compared to wt and its primary transcript as well . one target of mir <dig> is a tas <dig> transcript, which encodes tasirna <dig> processed by rdr6/dcl <dig> proteins
 <cit> . tasirna <dig> targets several myb transcription factors which regulate phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
 <cit> . several phenylpropanoid defense metabolites increase in n. attenuata during herbivory and silencing of dcl <dig> alters the accumulation of dicaffeoyl spermidine and caffeoylputrescine in w+os-elicited leaves
 <cit> . a jasmonate-inducible myb transcription factor, namyb <dig>  is involved in plant defense against herbivory and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
 <cit> . although we were not able to find a myb transcription factor containing a nat-tasirna <dig> binding site in our current cdna library, sequence conservation of mir <dig> and tasirna <dig> in a. thaliana and n. attenuata will guide the identification of targets which regulate secondary metabolite production.

temporal effect of single elicitation on mirnas and their targets accumulation
to examine the kinetics of mirnas in response to insect herbivory, we measured the accumulation of mirnas and their targets at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after treatments. most os-induced mirnas increased in abundance within  <dig> h after os-elicitation and continue to increase until  <dig> h, except mir <dig> and mir <dig> . the mirna <dig> increased at  <dig> h but decreased again by  <dig> h post-elicitation . os-inducible mirnas were also induced by wounding but the increase after wounding was less  or slower  than that after os-elicitation. interestingly, most of the mirna and tasirna target genes were reduced at  <dig> h after os-elicitation but return to control levels  or even increased to levels greater than prior to elicitation , suggesting a complex relationship between the regulator mature mirnas and their target genes.

comparison between primary and mature mirna transcript accumulation
we checked the accumulation of mir transcripts using previously reported microarray data
 <cit>   and confirmed these responses by qpcr . accumulation of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> was not correlated to the abundance of their mature mirnas. changes in transcript levels of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> reflected the transcript accumulation of their mature mirnas. generally, a weak relationship between mir and mature mirna accumulation has been reported
 <cit> . our data also suggests that the processing of mir transcripts is more important than the transcription of mir genes in herbivory-induced mirna regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
in order to build a database of plant mirnas functionally involved in plant-insect interactions, we investigated the accumulations of mirnas and their targets in n. attenuata after os-elicitation. we classified w+os-induced mirnas and tasirnas into four groups: ja-dependent or –independent wound-inducible and os-inducible mirnas or tasirnas . herbivore-attacked n. attenuata plants induce defense metabolites and tune their physiology to tolerate insect attack. this study shows that w+os elicitation, a rigorous means of mimicking herbivore attack, rapidly changed the expression of mirnas involved in flowering time, root morphology, senescence, hormone regulation, and metabolite synthesis. in future work, we will experimentally characterize the function of these w+os regulated ja-dependent and ja-independent mirnas and their targets.
