BACKGROUND
chromatin compaction is one of the critical factors regulating gene expression. the basic unit of chromatin, the nucleosome, consists of  <dig> base pairs  of dna wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins . many histone post-translational modifications contribute to establishing compacted, transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin ) or open, transcriptionally poised euchromatin   <cit> . however, it is currently unknown why so many modifications — on at least  <dig> histone residues  <cit>  — are necessary  <cit> . one possibility is that individual modifications have specialized properties, such as “indexing” classes of genomic elements  <cit> . nevertheless, such discriminating properties remain largely unknown, as redundancy and enzyme promiscuity for non-histone targets have limited the amenability of histone modifications to genetic experimentation  <cit> .

a potential solution to this problem is to apply supervised learning/classification techniques to high-throughput epigenomic data, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing  data, for histone modificatons. encouragingly, these approaches have had success in the related task of predicting the nucleosome occupancy of dna sequences: they have elicited predictive features with biological  and biophysical  interpretations. nevertheless, attempts to apply classification techniques to histone modifications have been less forthcoming. this is, in part, because such analyses require less readily available datasets, which correspond to many chip-seq experiments in the same cell type. as notable exceptions, barski et al.  <cit>  have generated a chip-seq dataset for  <dig> histone methylations and the histone variant h2a.z in human cd4+ t cells, and wang et al.  <cit> , of the same research group, have generated a similar dataset for  <dig> histone acetylations. a recent study by gervais and gaudreau  <cit>  applied classification techniques to histone modifications using these datasets.

in particular, gervais and gaudreau  <cit>  attempted to predict whether a nucleosome contains histone h2a.z or h2a/h <dig> arginine  <dig> symmetric dimethylation . importantly, these two classes are likely mutually exclusive: h2a.z lacks the r <dig> methylation site and localizes near active transcription start sites  <cit> , while h2a/h4r3me2s localizes with repressed heterochromatin  <cit> . the authors  <cit>  first performed classification with histone modification features  and, then, with dna sequence features . however, these analyses only achieved modest prediction accuracies of  <dig> % and <60%, respectively   <cit> . furthermore, there was limited biological interpretation for histone modification features and no interpretation for dna sequence features  <cit> .

a partial explanation for this modest performance may be insufficient data pre-processing. gervais and gaudreau  <cit>  used raw, aligned  chip-seq reads, and simply extended these to  <dig> bp to generate what they consider to be nucleosome-bound dna sequences. however, this approach is problematic. because chip-seq is only a slight enrichment  for sequences bound to the protein of interest  <cit> , it is notoriously noisy. the majority  of chip-seq reads are instead from the background. therefore, we, and others  <cit> , advocate using position-  finding algorithms, such as nucleosome positioning from sequencing   <cit>  , that identify stable nucleosome positions with statistically significant enrichment over background, prior to analysis. here, stable nucleosomes can be defined as those that are located at roughly the same chromosomal position across a population of cells and can therefore generate a signal peak when chip-seq reads are aligned. such nucleosomes are also referred to as being relatively well positioned or phased, and there is evidence for their regulatory importance  <cit> . while using stable nucleosome positions might limit the analysis to a subset of nucleosomes , we still believe this approach is preferable to using raw, aligned reads — of which only a small minority were likely even bound to the nucleosomes of interest. this approach of using stable nucleosomes was also utilized in a recent study  <cit> .

aside from the handling of signal and background, the approach of gervais and gaudreau  <cit>  might not adequately control for systematic biases present in chip-seq data. first, because of pcr amplification bias it may be advisable to collapse duplicate reads prior to analysis  <cit> . this is especially the case for datasets such as barski et al.  <cit>  and wang et al.  <cit>  where sequencing depth is relatively low, such that there is a lower likelihood of sequencing independently-precipitated fragments with the same start site . indeed, even for stable nucleosomes, the positioning is often blurry, with nucleosomes not having precisely the same start site across cells  <cit> . in addition, because coverage and the ability to detect peaks vary with sequencing depth, chip-seq experiments need to be normalized for the number of reads  <cit> . refined normalization approaches are emerging  <cit>  for chip-seq datasets that contain a mock immunoprecipitation  sample; however, for otherwise rich chip-seq datasets that lack such a mock ip, including  <cit>  and  <cit> , we believe data should still be normalized for the number of reads, in the absence of a more delicate approach for this type of data .

here, we employ appropriate chip-seq data pre-processing and sequence-customized, or otherwise advanced, algorithms to investigate their impact on the accuracy and interpretability of classifying nucleosomes containing h2a/h4r3me2s or h2a.z. for data pre-processing, we perform deduplication, normalization, and position-finding. further, for dna sequence-based classification, we utilize the recently developed discriminatory motif feature selection   <cit> , which, in addition to achieving impressive accuracy, emphasizes interpretability, unlike so-called “black-box” classifiers. specifically, dmfs elicits a small set of a priori discriminatory features  on a subsequently withheld data partition. this eliminates many noise features, which can comprise prediction and interpretation  <cit> , and loosens restrictive feature length prescriptions , which could otherwise fail to generate key, longer features. for classification based on histone modification features, we utilize an ensemble method, random forests  <cit> , which has been widely demonstrated to improve on individual classification trees  <cit> , as were deployed by gervais and gaudreau  <cit> . finally, we perform extensive downstream analysis. importantly, in addition to achieving dramatically improved accuracies, our classification algorithms elicit predictive, interpretable features that are consistent with recent biochemical findings  <cit> .

RESULTS
we pre-processed the barski et al.  <cit>  chip-seq dataset for  <dig> histone methylations and h2a.z to reduce bias. the percentage of duplicate reads in each experiment ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % , suggesting the potential for substantial pcr bias in some of the samples. we therefore collapsed duplicate reads into single reads. additionally, the number of unique reads in the experiments varied by more than 3-fold, indicating the potential for considerable sequencing depth variation  across the raw samples. we therefore normalized experiments for sequencing depth by down-sampling to the lowest number of unique reads observed .

using this filtered data, we identified stable nucleosome positions as signal peaks with statistically significant enrichment over the background by applying nps  <cit>  . this yielded  <dig> and  <dig> stable nucleosomes containing h2a/h4r3me2s and h2a.z, respectively . next, we down-sampled h2a.z nucleosomes to match the number of h2a/h4r3me2s nucleosomes for two reasons. first, this creates a balanced dataset for classification  and thus yields accuracies directly comparable to those of  <cit>  . indeed, using “class-imbalanced” data can result in a classifier that is biased toward the larger class  <cit> ; in the case of high-dimensional data, down-sampling the larger class is preferable to over-sampling the smaller class  <cit> . second, down-sampling emphasizes features associated with h2a/h4r3me2s, which is relatively under-studied compared to h2a.z. an added benefit of this approach is its reduction of the computational burden. all reported performance results are the mean of  performance summaries over  <dig> different random down-samplings of h2a.z nucleosomes, to ensure our balanced approach did not bias the results.

classification using histone modification features
the presence of one type of histone modification in a nucleosome can increase or decrease the likelihood of a second type  <cit> . therefore, to identify such potential interactions, we attempted to discriminate between stable nucleosomes containing h2a/h4r3me2s or h2a.z by using the co-localization with  <dig> other histone methylations and  <dig> histone acetylations  as features for classification. for each stable nucleosome, we generated an array of length  <dig> , where each entry is the number of deduplicated sequence reads for a feature modification that map within the nucleosome boundaries in a strand-specific manner . the motivation for using deduplicated sequence read counts for scoring overlap with feature modifications is that it results in a richer  matrix than scoring binary overlap with stable nucleosomes for the feature modifications. we still use stable nucleosomes, however, for the outcome modifications  and in downstream analyses.

we attained highly accurate random forests  prediction performance using histone modification features, with an accuracy of  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . this is a substantial improvement over the corresponding accuracy of  <dig> % that gervais and gaudreau  <cit>  report. to determine which features were “driving” the classification, we evaluated random forests feature importance by mean decrease in gini index . several features ranked prominently and withstood estimation of statistical significance by permutation testing : h4k20me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  h3r2me2a, h3k36me <dig>  h3k18ac, h3k9me <dig>  and h3k27ac had a permutation p < 1e- <dig> . the remaining histone modification features were not significant.

to further explore how these features relate to h2a/h4r3me2s, we built a single classification tree   <cit> , which, compared to the random forests ensemble of trees, may more readily reveal interpretable rules, albeit at the cost of decreased classification accuracy. consistent with the random forests feature importance ranking, the feature that best separated the data in the single tree is h4k20me <dig> . indeed,  <dig> out of  <dig> stable nucleosomes containing h2a/h4r3me2s were classified at the first split, based on overlapping with greater than two deduplicated, h4k20me <dig> sequence reads . three of the four remaining splits were also based on features that were had significant random forests feature importances . h3k9me <dig>  which had the second highest random forests feature importance, was not the basis for a split in the single tree; however, this may occur if, for example, the stable h2a/h4r3me2s nucleosomes that overlap with h3k9me <dig> are a subset of those that overlap with h4k20me <dig> .

encouragingly, the top two modifications by random forests feature importance, h4k20me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  are more frequent in stable nucleosomes containing h2a/h4r3me2s than those containing h2a.z . because h4k20me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> have been shown to contribute to the formation of heterochromatin  <cit>  – which is where h2a/h4r3me2s localizes — this initial finding supports the biological relevance of our classifier.

classification using dna sequence features
dna sequence likely influences the genome-wide distribution of histone modifications, as sequence-specific transcription factors and micrornas can bind and recruit histone-modifying enzymes  <cit> . thus, we used dna sequence motifs as features for classifying h2a/h4r3me2s and h2a.z nucleosomes for two reasons: first, to identify such potential targeting sequences, and second, to identify classes of genomic elements that the histone modification potentially regulates. using dmfs  <cit> , we identified < <dig> a priori discriminatory motifs with lengths between  <dig> and 10 bp from a subsequently withheld partition of the data .

as above, we attained highly accurate random forests prediction performance using dna sequence features , with an accuracy of  <dig> % ±  <dig> % . this is a dramatic improvement over the corresponding accuracy of <60% that gervais and gaudreau  <cit>  report. we next evaluated random forests feature importance by mdg . the top  <dig> features , all of which occur more frequently in dna corresponding to stable h2a/h4r3me2s nucleosome positions, withstand estimation of statistical significance by permutation testing, with permutation p < 1e- <dig> . interestingly,  <dig> of these  <dig> sequence features contain the motif tccatt . we therefore analyzed the frequency distribution of the number of occurrences of this motif in the dna sequences corresponding to stable nucleosome positions . indeed, while the motif tccatt is present in only ~7% of stable h2a.z nucleosomal dna sequences , it is present in ~72% of stable h2a/h4r3me2s nucleosomal dna sequences . that this 6-mer occurs so abundantly in many of the stable h2a/h4r3me2s nucleosomal dna sequences is suggestive of it being a repetitive element, or component thereof – an observation we explore in downstream analysis.

for thoroughness, however, we first performed a combined classification that utilized histone modification features and dna sequence features. this resulted in a classification accuracy of  <dig> % ±  <dig> % . feature importance analysis by mdg yielded many of the same top features as in the separate classifications, namely: h4k20me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  h3r2me2a, h3k36me <dig>  and sequences containing the motif tccatt.

downstream feature analysis
having elicited important, predictive features , we pursued downstream analysis in an attempt to determine how they relate functionally to h2a/h4r3me2s. first, given the abundant occurrence of the motif tccatt, we referenced the dna sequence composition of repetitive elements in the human genome. indeed, tccatt is part of the consensus sequence of satellite ii and iii dna   <cit> , which are types of transcriptionally competent, tandem repetitive elements located primarily in pericentromeric regions  <cit> .

subscripts indicate the number of occurrences of a subsequence in the consensus sequence. the motif tccatt is displayed in uppercase. for satellite iii dna, the motif also appears when two instances of the first subsequence are juxtaposed. adapted from  <cit> .

to determine if satellite ii and iii dna are the source of the tccatt motif detected, we analyzed the percentage of the total dna sequence bound to stable nucleosomes containing various histone modifications that is annotated as satellite ii and iii dna . indeed, around 63% of the total dna sequence bound to stable h2a/h4r3me2s nucleosomes is satellite ii and iii dna, while none of the stable h2a.z nucleosome -bound dna is . satellite ii and iii dna also contribute to the dna sequence bound to stable nucleosomes containing h4k20me <dig> or h3k9me <dig>  though they comprise a lower percentage . thus, stable h2a/h4r3me2s nucleosomal dna is enriched for tccatt motifs derived from satellite ii and iii dna. as an interesting aside, we found that a substantial portion of the dna bound to stable nucleosomes containing h4k20me <dig> or h3k9me <dig> is retrotransposons; this is not the case for stable nucleosomes containing h2a/h4r3me2s.

finally, we explored further the relationship between satellite ii and iii dna and various histone modifications. for each histone modification, we calculated occupancy <cit>  over aligned satellite ii  dna sequences, where occupancy is defined as the fraction of sequences at a position that are bound to a stable nucleosome containing that histone modification . we found that h2a/h4r3me2s and h4k20me <dig> had the highest occupancy over satellite ii dna sequences  and satellite iii dna sequences . h3k9me <dig> followed closely with occupancies of  <dig>  and  <dig>  over satellite ii and iii dna, respectively. on the other hand, h2a.z and  <dig> other histone methylations in the barski et al.  <cit>  datatset had no or almost no occupancy over these satellites . these findings are depicted in figure 3b.

thus, downstream analysis functionally relates the elicited features to h2a/h4r3me2s and to each other: h2a/h4r3me2s, h4k20me <dig>  and h3k9me <dig> all occur on stable nucleosomes in satellite ii and iii dna sequences, from which the motif tccatt is derived. these interactions are consistent with recent biochemical experimental results, a point we return to in the discussion.

discussion
emerging, high-throughput epigenomic data, including chip-seq data, may provide insight into mechanisms of chromatin structure and gene regulation. however, realizing the full potential of this data requires a computational framework that reduces bias, maximizes algorithm accuracy, and elicits predictive and biologically interpretable features. to this end, we classified nucleosomes containing h2a/h4r3me2s or h2a.z, as in  <cit> , but instead employed appropriate data pre-processing and advanced classification algorithms, resulting in greatly improved accuracy and interpretative yield.

indeed, interpretation of chip-seq is challenging because of the magnitude and complexity of the data . this is particularly true when comparing multiple histone modifications . encouragingly, approaches aiming to improve chip-seq interpretation, albeit not directly applicable to our analyses, appear in the recent literature. for example, fernandez et al.  <cit>  use a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal number of histone modification profiles to combine to identify transcriptional enhancers, while beck et al.  <cit>  aim to improve chip-seq interpretation by incorporating information about peak shape via linear predictive coding.

in light of these challenges, and given the problems with enumerative feature approaches , we decided to employ a recently devised pipeline for sequence-based classification, dmfs  <cit> , that focuses on feature interpretation. dmfs elicits a small set of a priori discriminatory features  using a subsequently withheld data partition. using dmfs, we evaluated a feature length range between  <dig> and 10 bp by eliciting <  <dig> a priori discriminatory motifs. in contrast, evaluating this length range with enumerative approaches would require a burdensome, if not prohibitive, Σ 4k =  <dig> features. thus, feature length often needs to be highly restricted for enumerative approaches, which can then fail to elicit longer, potentially important  features. even with feature length prescriptions, enumerative approaches still employ multitudes of noise features, which can degrade performance  <cit>  and complicate determination of feature importance and interpretation. thus, using dmfs to eliminate univariately unimportant features at the outset has advantages; however, it can miss features whose effects are strict  interactions.

some attempts have been made to improve interpretation of enumerative feature classification. most existing enumerative techniques rely heavily on support vector machine  classifiers that employ sophisticated, problem-specific kernels, notably the spectrum kernel  <cit>  and variants thereof  <cit> , such as the so-called “blended spectrum” kernel used previously  <cit>  to analyze the data considered here. determining feature importance for such approaches is arguably very challenging , given inherent feature dependencies  and kernel complexity. some inventive methods have been developed to address these issues  <cit> . nevertheless, these methods are necessarily constrained: input sequences need to be the same length and only select svm kernels are supported. thus, another advantage of the dmfs approach is that it provides a modular, all-purpose, pipeline applicable to any  classification problem with any sequence inputs.

in the current study, we employed dmfs for sequence-based classification using pre-processed data. for the sake of comparability, we also tried applying dmfs to raw, aligned, extended chip-seq reads as used in  <cit> , which resulted in a classification accuracy similar to that of gervais and gaudreau  <cit> . thus, while dmfs provided the benefits of ready interpretation, modularity, and computational efficiency, the improvements in performance that we achieved are largely attributable to data pre-processing. indeed, several authors  <cit>  have advocated chip-seq data pre-processing based on observations of bias and extensive background reads. peak-finding methods have also been specifically designed for histone modification chip-seq data: sicer  <cit>  identifies broad chromatin domains enriched for a histone modification, while nps  <cit>  identifies individual, stable nucleosomes that contain a histone modification. our study is valuable in that it demonstrates empirically the gains in classification performance that result from chip-seq data pre-processing, thus substantiating the advocacy thereof.

another valuable aspect of our study is that the identified features are consistent with recent biochemical experimental results. our classification approaches identified the motif tccatt  and the histone modifications h4k20me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> as predictive of h2a/h4r3me2s nucleosomes. consistent with this, zhao et al.  <cit>  recently demonstrated that h4r3me2s provides a direct binding site for the dna methyltransferase  that methylates satellite ii and iii dna  <cit> . the enzyme that mediates h3k9me <dig> also interacts directly with dnmt3a  <cit> . furthermore, the proper occurrence of h4k20me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> has been shown to be partially dependent on prmt <dig>  the enzyme that mediates h2a/h4r3me2s  <cit> . interestingly, the aberrant expression of satellite ii and iii dna, which is observed in senescent cells  <cit>  and cancers  <cit> , may promote genomic instability via chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . thus, our finding that h2a/h4r3me2s, h4k20me <dig>  and h3k9me <dig> occur in stable nucleosomes in satellite ii and iii dna sequences genome-wide may be consequential in terms of understanding how these genomic elements are normally repressed in healthy, differentiated tissue.

in future work, we will extend our analyses to classifying the  <dig> other histone modifications in the barski et al.  <cit>  dataset. this could be realized using an iterative one-against-all approach, which would be more high-throughput , or using a targeted, biologically motivated approach. with respect to the latter, of particular interest would be discriminating between histone modifications that localize with facultative  and constitutive  heterochromatin. indeed, dna elements capable of recruiting the facultative heterochromatin machinery have not been identified in the human genome so far, though they have been in the drosophila genome . additionally, we will explore the impact of alternative chip-seq normalization approaches, including some more refined, emerging methods  <cit> . however, because such methods often rely on a mock immunoprecipitation  sample, which many otherwise rich chip-seq datasets lack , it would be worthwhile to pursue developing a method for identifying the background in datasets with multiple experimental ips but no mock ip. similarly, it would be a great advance to develop an algorithm that could identify and remove read buildups that correspond to pcr amplification bias without collapsing “biological” duplicate reads – especially as the latter will be common in newer datasets with very high sequencing depth. finally, we could pursue, though more ambitious, developing an algorithm for multi-class classification with a similarly discriminatory framework  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that applying advanced classification algorithms to appropriately pre-processed chip-seq data results in greatly improved prediction accuracy and feature interpretative yield in genome-wide discrimination between histone modifications. the discriminatory motif feature selection approach that we employed has the added potential to facilitate interpretation of the biological mechanism underlying the classifier performance. finally, and perhaps most importantly, the findings presented here demonstrate that statistical/machine learning analyses of epigenomic data can identify interpretable, biologically meaningful properties of histone modifications, which have been difficult to study by traditional genetic experimentation.
