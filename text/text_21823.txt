BACKGROUND
over the past decades, the aquaculture industry has significantly advanced in terms of technology and rearing methods due to the growing demand of fish for human consumption  <cit> . while many different species are cultured worldwide, the chilean finfish industry is highly concentrated in salmonid farming  <cit> . however, there is a recent local and global trend towards diversifying breeding species to maintain the sustainability of the aquaculture industry  <cit> . in chile, one such cultivated marine species is the red cusk-eel , a teleost of the ophidiidae family  <cit> . this fish is highly valued in national and international markets due to exceptional flesh quality and high nutritional value  <cit> . nevertheless, the culturing of this species is seriously hindered by scarce biological knowledge and, primarily, limited information on the negative effects of stress associated with intensive farming in marine species  <cit> .

the stress response in fish occurs when a stimulus is perceived as a threat. this response increases cortisol secretion, as mediated through the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis  <cit> . if the stress is chronic, affected individuals could have permanently increased circulating cortisol levels, a situation that involves short-term metabolic changes and a long-term response associated with reduced growth  <cit> . an important tissue for growth regulation is skeletal muscle, which is fundamental for an organism’s metabolism and physiology  <cit> . in mammals, it is well documented that under stressful pathological conditions increased cortisol levels are associated to skeletal muscle atrophy results from increased protein breakdown and decreased protein synthesis  <cit> , however relatively little is known about this condition in teleost skeletal muscle. the two major route that increases overall rates of protein degradation during muscle atrophy are the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosome systems  <cit> . the stimulation by cortisol of these two protein degradation pathways are mediated through the increased expression of several atrogenes, such as atrogin- <dig>  <cit> , foxo  <cit>  and murf- <dig>  <cit> , as well as other intracellular mediators related to autophagy such as klf <dig>  <cit> , and redd <dig>  <cit> . although a few studies have gone further in the understanding of skeletal muscle response in relation to different stressors in teleosts by using pcr arrays  <cit> , microarray , and rna-seq approaches , there are no studies focused to understand the relevance of cortisol in the skeletal muscle response to stress.

it was only recently that the first annotated transcriptome of g. chilensis was published through the use of illumina technology, thus providing valuable transcriptomic information for this species and for members of the ophidiidae family  <cit> . the aim of the present study was to characterize the effect of the stress caused by handling on the skeletal muscle of g. chilensis, an economically important marine fish in the chilean aquaculture industry. for this, illumina reads obtained from control and stressed fish were mapped onto the reference transcriptome of the red cusk-eel to identify differentially expressed transcripts . gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of catabolic genes associated with skeletal muscle atrophy. using in vitro approximations, it was also determined that cortisol-mediated genomic actions are a powerful inductor of skeletal muscle atrophy in fish. in the short term, these results will aid in modifying rearing protocols, the aim of which is to improve animal welfare. importantly, these results also contribute towards the overall understanding of the atrophy system in a non-model teleost, providing novel insights on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control skeletal muscle growth in early vertebrates.

RESULTS
physiological and transcriptomic responses of red cusk-eel skeletal muscle to handling stress
juvenile red cusk-eels were stressed daily with a netting and chasing protocol, and samples were obtained after five days of this procedure. plasma cortisol and glucose levels significantly increased  as compared to the control fish, revealing the magnitude of the stress induced by handling. however, no significant differences in plasma lactate levels were observed . two separate cdna libraries were constructed from the skeletal muscle of pooled juvenile red cusk-eels from control and stressed conditions. to examine sequencing variations, cdna library replicates of each condition were constructed. in total, illumina miseq sequencing generated  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads . raw data were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under accession number . after trimming adapters, low quality base pairs, and short reads, the two sequence sets were reduced to  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads . these reads were analyzed with the clc genomic workbench software v. <dig> . <dig> using the previously reported reference transcriptome for g. chilensis  <cit> , resulting in ~ <dig>  % of the reads mapped. the expression level of each transcript was represented as rpkm, with  <dig> transcripts up-regulated under stressed conditions and  <dig> transcripts down-regulated under stressed conditions. a complete list of the differentially expressed transcripts is included in additional file 1: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate levels in control and handling stress groups. data are represented as means ± sem . for all graphs, white and black bars represent control and stressed groups respectively. different letters indicate significant differences among sampling points of each group



gene ontology  enrichment, kegg pathway analysis and qpcr validation
the david gene functional classification tool was used to identify groups of transcripts sharing common go terms. the transcripts up-regulated under stressed conditions were significantly enriched in biological processes, such as modification-dependent macromolecule catabolic process , modification-dependent protein catabolic process , and cellular protein catabolic process , among others . the down-regulated transcripts under stressed conditions were significantly enriched in biological processes including striated muscle contraction , muscle organ development , and muscle contraction , among others . the go terms for up-regulated transcripts were significantly enriched in molecular functions, such as ubiquitin-protein ligase activity , acid-amino acid ligase activity , and small conjugating protein ligase activity , among others . the go terms for down-regulated transcripts were significantly enriched in molecular functions, such as cytoskeletal protein binding , structural constituent of muscle , actin binding , among others . the enrichment of up-regulated transcripts in cellular component distribution were in membrane-enclosed lumen , organelle lumen , and intracellular organelle lumen , among others . the enrichment of down-regulated transcripts in cellular component distribution were in contractile fiber part , sarcomere , and contractile fiber , among others . finally, pathway analysis through kegg revealed up-regulated transcripts to be enriched in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, regulation of autophagy, and proteasome . the down-regulated transcripts were enriched in kegg pathways such as muscle contraction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy .table  <dig> enriched biological processes of up-regulated and down-regulated transcripts in response to handling stress

discussion
genypterus chilensis is an economically important marine species for chilean aquaculture industry. the first reference transcriptome for this species was previously sequenced and annotated through illumina hiseq paired-end sequencing  <cit> . in this study, rna-seq analysis was used to determine the effects of handling stress on the skeletal muscle of the red cusk-eel, revealing  <dig> dets associated with an up-regulation of catabolic biological processes or a down-regulation of skeletal muscle contraction biological processes. the results obtained by this in silico approach were validated by a rt-qpcr analysis of genes representative of the most relevant identified processes, as well as by an in vitro approach that revealed interesting details regarding the regulation dynamics and mechanisms of cortisol-mediated skeletal muscle atrophy in fish. in general terms, the present study found the primary stress response associated to increased levels cortisol and glucose in plasma was very similar to other fish species, such as the rainbow trout   <cit>  or senegalese sole   <cit> .

in teleosts, cortisol is the primary glucocorticoid and regulator of the physiological response to stress  <cit> . cortisol binds and activates specific corticoid receptors in target tissues. in fish there are two types of corticoid steroid receptors: mineralocorticoid receptors  and glucocorticoid receptors   <cit> . most fish possess one mr and two gr isoforms, gr <dig> and gr <dig>  <cit> . once inside the cell, cortisol binds to cytoplasmic grs to induce conformational changes that cause the receptor to dissociate from respective chaperone molecules. the hormone-receptor complex then translocates to the nucleus where it dimerises and binds to the glucocorticoid response elements of target genes  <cit> . depending on the co-factors recruited, this leads to the transactivation or transrepression of these genes. this mode of cortisol action is referred to as the classical or genomic pathway  <cit> . cortisol-mediated stress is a key controller in aerobic and anaerobic metabolism  <cit> , increasing gluconeogenesis, and inhibiting glycogen synthesis  <cit> . an increased metabolic rate contributes to reduced growth. cortisol may also control growth by acting through elevated plasma glucose levels to reduce appetite and food ingestion  <cit> . due to this, elevated cortisol levels could be inferred through reduced food conversion efficiency, and growth  <cit> .

for years it was assumed that the low growth rates experienced by fish under stressful conditions were due to metabolic changes impacting anabolic processes  <cit> . however, the present work is the first to evidence that stress mediated by cortisol induces the expression of components associated with skeletal muscle catabolism. the transcripts up-regulated under stressed conditions were associated with catabolic pathways such as ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and autophagy, while down-regulated transcripts were associated with muscle contraction or muscle hypertrophy pathways. interestingly in humans, similar signatures have been observed in skeletal muscle atrophy induced by corticosteroids used to treat several pathological conditions or by cortisol released in response to stress conditions such as sepsis, cachexia, and starvation  <cit> .

in mammals, in vitro models have been very useful in defining the glucocorticoid pathway by reducing complexity, as compared to an in vivo model  <cit> . similarly, fish myotubes primary culture has been used as a valid model for understanding the signaling pathways involved in muscle development and growth in teleost, including for glucose transport  <cit> , tor signaling  <cit> , igf- <dig> signaling , myostatin signaling  <cit> , gh signaling  <cit> , proinflammatory cytokine signaling  <cit> , pamps signaling  <cit> , and cortisol signaling  <cit> . similarly, in the present study using an in vitro model, it was determined that cortisol through the expression of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome systems was an inductor of skeletal muscle atrophy in fish,.

the maximum foxo1expression in myotubes occurred 24 h post-treatment with cortisol. the role of this transcription factor in skeletal muscle atrophy induced by glucocorticoids has been demonstrated in mammals through in vitro and in vivo approximations . moreover, a recent study demonstrated the presence of functional glucocorticoid response elements in the mammalian foxo <dig> promoter  <cit> . in fish, the expression and activity of foxo <dig> have been observed under nutritional stress in fine flounder   <cit> . interestingly, igf- <dig>  an inductor of skeletal muscle hypertrophy, induced the phosphorylation of foxo <dig> and foxo <dig> in trout myotubes in association with decreased transcriptional activity  <cit> . the described foxo <dig> target genes included atrogin- <dig> , a protein involved in muscle proteolysis via the ubiquitin-proteasome system  <cit> . atrogin- <dig> expression occurs in relation to skeletal muscle atrophy under fasting conditions in rainbow trout  <cit>  and fine flounder  <cit> . recently, it was determined that foxo1/atrogin- <dig> signaling pathway is involved in the skeletal muscle atrophy induced by lps in rainbow trout myotubes  <cit> .

other important components of protein catabolism include the 26s proteasome and autophagosome. the up-regulation of the 26s proteasome non-atpase regulatory subunit  <dig>  has been observed in atrophying fast-twitch muscles from rats treated with dexamethasone  <cit> ; however, there are no reports on the differential expression of this gene in teleosts. a similar phenomenon has been reported for atg <dig> and atg16l <dig>  where dexamethasone treatment in l <dig> myotubes induces the expression of several autophagy genes 24 h post-treatment, including of atg <dig> and atg16l <dig>  <cit> . in teleost species, atg <dig> activity in zebrafish has been linked to neurogenesis and organogenesis  <cit> . nevertheless, there are no reports that relate atg <dig> gene expression with fish muscle atrophy.

another gene with differential expression identified in this study was redd <dig> , a cytoplasmic protein with a crucial role in repressing protein synthesis mediated by tor  <cit> . additionally, the same signaling pathway showed an over expression of 4ebp- <dig> . this protein represses protein synthesis by directly interacting with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e  <cit> . in both cases, the present study detected maximum expression 12 h post-treatment with cortisol, suggesting that the inhibition of protein synthesis precedes atrogene expression. in mammals, acute dexamethasone treatment induces redd <dig> mrna expression in rat skeletal muscle in vivo and in l <dig> myoblasts, as well as down-regulating mtor signaling through the activation of 4ebp- <dig>  <cit> . in zebrafish, redd <dig> regulates dorsoventral patterning through the negative modulation of wnt/β-catenin activity  <cit> .

among the genes down-regulated under handling stress, the present study found proteins associated with contractile functions and development, including specific muscle transcription factors such as myod <dig> and myod <dig>  both proteins belong to the myogenic regulatory factors  protein family and are involved in the regulation of teleost myogenesis  <cit> . while both transcripts had decreased expression in rna-seq analysis, only myod <dig> showed a significant decrease in its expression in rt-qpcr analysis. moreover, changes in expression were not detected for myod <dig> or myod <dig> in fish myotubes treated with cortisol. this result differs from that observed in mammals, where treatment of the c2c <dig> myoblast with dexamethasone reduces myod expression  <cit> . this observation can be explained by the differences between mammalian and teleost myogenesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present work used rna-seq analysis to determine the effects of handling stress on the skeletal muscle transcriptome of g. chilensis, an important marine fish for the chilean aquaculture industry. handling stress induced physiological changes, associated with increases in circulating levels of cortisol, and major changes in global skeletal muscle gene expression. under stressed conditions,  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in association with catabolic signaling pathway such as the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome systems. conversely,  <dig> transcripts were down-regulated under stressed conditions in association with biological processes such as muscle contraction and muscle system processes. the transcriptional expression of components from the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways were analyzed by rt-qpcr and all were significantly increased under handling stress. to further analyze the relevance of cortisol in teleost skeletal muscle atrophy, an in vitro approximation was performed, providing details about the dynamics and mechanisms by which cortisol induces skeletal muscle atrophy in teleosts. there was a coordinated expression of genes related to the suppression of protein synthesis, protein ubiquitination, and autophagy. all of these were modulated by the genomic actions of cortisol. this is the first study to indicate that stress and cortisol are powerful inductors of skeletal muscle atrophy in a teleost, in addition to providing valuable information for monitoring the culturing and growth of marine fish species under intensive rearing conditions.
