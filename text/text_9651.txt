BACKGROUND
mitochondria are a crucial component of every eukaryotic cell and provide indispensable functions including i) cell energy supply ii) synthesis of essential molecules such as phospholipids and heme, and iii) mediating multiple cellular signaling pathways including stress response, apoptosis and aging  <cit> . it is widely accepted that mitochondria and chloroplast descended from free-living bacterial ancestors  <cit>  that were acquisitioned into eukaryotic cells. following their acquisition, most of the genes in these organelles were either lost or transferred to the nucleus  <cit> . although these organelles possess their own genomes, most of their proteins  are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytoplasm and then imported for use  <cit> .

there is great variability in size and number of genes of eukaryotic mitochondrial genomes. the average size of a mitochondrial genome is about 15–60 kb in animals while in seed plants they range from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb  <cit> . the number of genes in the mitochondrial genome of eukaryotes is also variable, from  <dig> in plasmodium to  <dig> in jakobid flagellates and with average between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . recent sequencing of the hexaploid wheat  mitochondrial genome revealed interesting features of this genome relative to other monocots such as rice and maize  <cit> . the size of this genome is 452 kb  <cit>  compared to 491 kb for rice  <cit> , and  <dig> to 740 kb for various zea mays genotypes  <cit> . this mitochondrial genome of hexaploid wheat includes  <dig> known genes and  <dig> orfs larger than 300 bp in size. about 15% of this genome is repetitive sequences, 3% is of chloroplast origin and  <dig> % is of retro-element origin. the gene order of the wheat mitochondrial genome showed little synteny to that of rice and maize  <cit> .

a diverse range of methods have been used for sequencing the whole mitochondrial genome of over fifty different species currently deposited at ncbi organelle genome resources. at the beginning bac library construction combined with sanger sequencing was the only method for mitochondrial dna  sequencing , although currently next generation sequencing  is being used as a replacement . the advent of ngs techniques  set the stage for high throughput, inexpensive mitochondrial genome comparisons among diverse species  <cit> . however, the multipartite nature along with large and short repeated sequences  <cit>  has made de novo assembly of the mitochondrial genome a challenge. despite the challenges in de novo assembly the depth of sequencing provided by ngs is so high that is quite suitable for detection of mitochondrial genome variants in a cell  <cit> .

usually more than one type of mitochondrial genome  occurs in a cell, defined as heteroplasmy. the ratio of different mitotypes in a heteroplasmic population may be variable, with one major mitotype dominant and others present in a very low proportion  <cit> . heteroplasmy seems to be an evolutionary strategy of maternally inherited plant mitochondrial genomes to compensate for lack of sexual recombination. therefore different mitotypes in the cell accumulate as a reservoir of genetic variability and may undergo accelerated evolution  <cit> . occasionally, some mitotypes are selected and amplified in the process called substoichiometric shifting, and become the prominent mitochondrial genome  <cit> . prevalence of each mitotype is believed to be controlled strictly by nuclear gene in a tissue specific manner  <cit> . an example of this interaction is the nuclear fertility restorer  gene in common bean which decreases the male sterility associated mitotype  to a substoichiometric level that recovers the fertility  <cit> . a detailed study on the complex nature of the plant mitochondrial genome was conducted by analyzing the composition of three different genes, atp <dig>  atp <dig> and rps <dig>  in alloplasmic and euplasmic lines of wheat  <cit> . this study suggested that paternal mitochondrial types are increased by up to 30% in alloplasmic lines but they tend to be silenced.

alloplasmic lines are created when the cytoplasm of one species is replaced by that of another species through substitution backcrossing. this alloplasmic condition disrupts the interactions between the nucleus and cytoplasm which have co-evolved together as illustrated in alloplasmic lines of tigriopus and drosophila <cit> . the disruption of nuclear mitochondrial  interactions in plants by alloplasmic condition usually leads to cytoplasmic male sterility   <cit> . it is believed that pollen-forming tissue demand tremendous amount of energy and have a lower threshold for respiratory deficiencies than other plant tissue  <cit> . therefore in most cases the alloplasmic lines are cms as well. in all cases examined, the cms phenotype results from the presence of novel proteins in the mitochondria affecting mitochondrial function and pollen development  <cit> . the new orfs, leading to the production of novel proteins, are the consequence of highly rearranged mitochondrial genome  <cit> . research also indicates alterations in the mitochondrial gene expression patterns in alloplasmic plants  <cit> .

wheat has the largest collection of alloplasmic lines created in any species  <cit> , providing an un-precedent opportunity to analyze nm interactions. these lines have exhibited vegetative and physiological phenotypes different from their parents. some alloplasmic wheat, with the ae. mutica or the ae. crassa cytoplasms, showed higher yield, increased tolerance to abiotic stresses, and improved seed quality . in this study, the mitochondrial genomes of three triticum-aegilops species were sequenced and described; durum alloplasmic line  durum with the ae. longissima cytoplasm with the nucleus from the t. turgidum var. durum plus its two euplasmic parents. the  durum line was developed and described by s.s. maan  <cit> . the main focus of this study was to investigate the level of changes that occurred in the mitochondrial genome in the alloplasmic condition. sequencing of mitochondrial genome in these three lines allows for analysis of changes in the mitochondrial genome of the alloplasmic line compared to its euplasmic parents.

RESULTS
genome assembly
the average sequence read length was 449 bp as expected for  <dig> gs flx sequencing technology. the purification method  <cit>  provided mitochondrial dna free from nuclear dna contamination which was confirmed by quantitative real time pcr. based on sequencing read counts,  <dig> to 9% of overall reads were chloroplastic dna and no nuclear dna was detected. the majority of sequencing reads  were used for mitochondrial genome assembly, with the exception of the ae. longissima where only 32% of the reads were used. the remaining 12-28% of reads that were not assembled created additional contigs which contained valid mitochondrial sequences. these contigs may provide additional information about possible mitotypes present in smaller proportion relative to the most prevailing type presented in the final assemblies.

the mitochondrial genomes obtained for t. turgidum was  <dig>  bp and sequence was similar to the previously sequenced t. aestivum cv. chinese spring  <cit> . although sequences were nearly identical,  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  were observed between the two genomes, five were in known mitochondrial genes: rps <dig>  rps <dig>  cox <dig> and ccmfn. the estimated size of the  durum and the ae. longissima genomes were  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. overall coverage of the sequenced genomes was  <dig> – 133x , which allowed analysis of heteroplasmy.table  <dig>

genome structure
using the t. aestivum cv. chinese spring as the reference, the t. turgidum, the  durum, and the ae. longissima mitochondrial genomes were assembled. the t. turgidum mitochondrial genome sequence is missing a region of about  <dig>  bp  present in the t. aestivum mitochondrial genome . there were  <dig> and  <dig> regions with no reads for the ae. longissima and the  durum, respectively . however, nine of these regions  appeared to be in common, but there are size differences between some of them . regions vi, x, xi and xvi were present in the ae. longissima but not in the alloplasmic line. regions iii, iv, and vii were present in the alloplasmic line but not the ae. longissima . these differences could indicate the presence of genome rearrangements, new genetic information or high polymorphism hindering complete assembly. these results indicate changes in the predominant genome and also the lack of these regions in the minor mitotypes.figure  <dig> 
comparison of mitochondrial genomes in the alloplasmic lines and its parental lines based on reference assembly. blue boxes represent gaps  in assembly as compared with the triticum aestivum  reference. the t. turgidum assembly has only one gap of  <dig>  bp that is not indicated.



considering the gaps in the reference assembly, de novo assembly of the genomes could reveal structural changes reflecting recombination and/or other rearrangement events within the mitochondrial genomes. within these regions are blocks of dna that share high sequence similarity , indicating conservation of mitochondrial genome content, but not genome structure. to precisely describe the possible recombination events within genomes and the differences which appear in the  durum line as an effect of the alloplasmic condition, a detailed gene order description was initiated. based on the syntenic relationship between genomes , three gene categories were established. 1) genes, which do not follow any recognizable pattern, 2) gene pairs that move together and, 3) genes that tend to remain together in blocks. examination of these blocks revealed that there were  <dig> recombination/rearrangement events between the t. turgidum and the alloplasmic  durum and  <dig> between the ae. longissima and the alloplasmic  durum. four pairs of genes  and seven conserved gene blocks can be detected between the alloplasmic line and both parents . these blocks account for  <dig> genes  out of  <dig> total, providing evidence for the relative stability of the gene order between these species. three gene blocks show rearrangements within them: blocks i, v and vi, with lengths of  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in the t. turgidum . blocks i and v conserve the same gene order except for atp <dig>  and cob  having moved from one end of the block to the other end. in block vi, orf <dig> located after ccmfc exon- <dig> in the t. turgidum and nad <dig> exons  <dig> and  <dig> are reversed relative to  durum. the location of rps <dig> has been moved adjacent to block vi in the ae. longissima and  durum. the gene blocks consist of about 32%  of the whole genome.figure  <dig>

major differences in genes
the  <dig> protein coding genes, three rrna and  <dig> trna genes characterized in the t. aestivum mitochondrial genome  <cit>  were identified in the sequenced lines. majority of the genes are highly conserved between mitochondrial genomes in these three lines .

six genes  had many nucleotide changes in the  durum and the ae. longissima genomes compared with the t. turgidum genome. one difference is recognized in the atp <dig> gene between the t. turgidum  and the  durum line . this mitochondrial gene, encodes atp synthase f <dig> subunit  <dig>  the apt6- <dig> gene found in the ae. longissima and the  durum  has an altered pre-sequence in comparison to the t. turgidum . however, there was no difference in the surrounding region of this gene which is conserved among all three species. in addition, they share a highly similar core region of 869 bp . a blast search found the pre-sequence of atp <dig> from the ae. longissima and the  durum is present only in the male sterile alloplasmic t. aestivum line with the ae. kotschyi cytoplasm reported recently  <cit> . in addition to having the characteristic pre-sequence for the female parent, the  durum has a number of snp’s in the core region when compared to the t. turgidum gene. these changes are c/a <dig>  a/t <dig>  t/a <dig>  a/t <dig>  t/a <dig>  a/c <dig>  t/g <dig>  including snp t/g <dig> specific only to the  durum. the amplification of atp6-l and atp6-t alleles based on mitochondrial dna and total dna isolation was performed to confirm the sequences obtained from the assembly . the atp6-t amplification was detected in the t. turgidum mtdna, but not in the ae. longissima and the  durum mtdna. when pcr was performed based on the total dna, no product was observed in the case of the ae. longissima, but for the  durum, and the t. turgidum a proper allele was amplified. amplification of atp6-l allele  confirmed its presence in the ae. longissima and the  durum. the t. turgidum showed no proper amplification in mtdna; however, the allele seems to be present in its nucleus due to amplification in total dna.figure  <dig>

another major gene difference was observed in nad <dig> . a four-nucleotide deletion  was present in nad <dig> of the ae. longissima. the alloplasmic durum line doesn’t share this deletion. however, a characteristic di-nucleotide difference, tg/ca134- <dig> in relation to the t. turgidum, was observed resulting in v/a <dig> substitution in the nad <dig> protein. the four-nucleotide deletion found at position  <dig> creates a frame shift in the ae. longissima gene and generates a stop codon at position  <dig> . this creates an alteration in protein length compared to the t. turgidum. beside these changes, an additional three snps were observed in the region before the stop codon, but no other polymorphisms were found across the rest of the gene. there is a snp a/c <dig> specific to  durum, and two snps c/a <dig> and a/t <dig> found in both the ae. longissima and  durum. each of the snps creates amino-acid changes, n/h <dig>  s/y <dig>  k/i <dig> respectively, in the nad <dig> protein.

the nad <dig> mitochondrial gene is responsible for coding subunit  <dig> of complex i, the nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is built from at least  <dig> different subunits that are mainly encoded by the nucleus. multi-alignment of the nad <dig> gene alleles  shows that a truncated version of nad <dig> is present in the ae. longissima and the  durum lines, but not in the t. turgidum. the conserved region begins at the atg start codon and continues until nucleotide  <dig>  no polymorphism was found between the alloplasmic line and its parents within the conserved region of the gene.

a nine-nucleotide deletion  in the rps19-p pseudo gene was recognized in the t. turgidum mitochondrial in relation to the  durum and the ae. longissima. there are no allelic differences between the last two lines . a polymorphism was also identified in the sequence of cob and cox <dig> exon- <dig> when the t. turgidum was compared to the  durum and the ae. longissima. both genes were 10 bp shorter at the 3′end in the t. turgidum compared to the other two lines .

polymorphism of genes within and between chondriomes
there were multiple alleles of a gene present at different stoichiometric levels due to heteroplasmy in chondriome of each line. to identify nucleotide changes in the genes between chondriomes, the predominant allele for each line was used for comparison. in total  <dig> and  <dig> snps were identified for the ae. longissima and the alloplasmic line compared to the t. turgidum, respectively . the total number of nucleotide variations observed in the alloplasmic  durum line was higher than any of the other species examined. six snps found in cox <dig> exon- <dig> , mttb , rps <dig> , rps <dig> , and rps <dig>  were identified as unique to the alloplasmic line, and differentiate it from both parents. our data shows that the ribosomal coding genes are the most variable when compared to the other mitochondrial protein coding genes. three out of six snps observed between the  durum and the ae. longissima were found in the ribosomal protein coding genes rps <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig> .table  <dig>

differences in nucleotide sequences between genomes results in changes in amino acid sequences and potentially function of proteins. several of the observed differences  also change the amino acid sequences. to try to predict whether the observed amino acid changes would result in altered activities, the amino acid sequences of the cox <dig>  rps <dig>  and mttb proteins were compared to other related monocots and arabidopsis thaliana. all of the observed changes were found in other species with the exception of the a/e <dig> change in the rps <dig> gene of the  durum which was unique to that line .figure  <dig>

variations in copy number of genes
some genes such as ccmb and rpl <dig>  were missing in the  durum mitochondrial genome. the rpl <dig> gene is present in the ae. longissima genome. there were also differences in the number of gene copies for instance atp <dig> and atp <dig> were present in two copies  in the assembled ae. longissima mitochondrial genome but just one copy in the assemble  durum genome. three copies of rrn <dig> were identified in t. turgidum and in the  durum genomes, while just one copy was present in the ae. longissima. no polymorphism within these genes was identified among the species. two copies of the rrn <dig> gene were identified in the t. turgidum, two copies in the ae. longissima , and one copy in the  durum.

snps between and within the chondriome of each line
the existence of heteroplasmy was confirmed based on the existence of snps within chondriome of each line studied hereafter referred to as heteroplasmic snps . within the chondriomes of the t. turgidum, the  durum, and the ae. longissima,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hsnps were identified, respectively . during the snp search multiple regions of higher hsnp density  were evident compared to regions with only a single nucleotide change. these regions were unevenly distributed throughout the mitochondrial genomes. in the t. turgidum  <dig> hsnp blocks were identified containing  <dig> hsnps, in the  durum  <dig> blocks with  <dig> hsnps  and in the ae. longissima  <dig> regions, with  <dig> hsnps in contig i and  <dig> regions,  <dig> hsnps in contig ii. no specific pattern of hsnp blocks was recognized. the number of hsnps outside of these hsnp blocks were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in the t. turgidum, the  durum and the ae. longissima respectively .figure  <dig> 
hsnp distribution across the  durum mitochondrial genome. blue lines indicates hsnp positions, red line indicate the position of hsnp blocks. we found  <dig> hsnps in total, out of them  <dig> were hsnps and  <dig> created  <dig> hsnp blocks. the overall hsnp density is 1hsnp/ <dig>  bp.



a polymorphism search between the final consensus sequences of each genome was also performed. in total,  <dig> and  <dig> snps found comparing the  durum line with the ae. longissima and the t. turgidum respectively. there were also  <dig> snps between the ae. longissima and the t. turgidum.

orf identification and comparison
previously, several orfs  have been identified in the t. aestivum <cit> . the sequenced species were checked for the presence and potential polymorphism in these orfs. the orf <dig> and orf <dig> did not show any polymorphism among sequenced species. the orf <dig> in the alloplasmic line and the ae. longissima carried a di-nucleotide difference of tt/ag <dig> when compared to the t. turgidum genome. the orf <dig> from the t. turgidum, which was identical to the t. aestivum, was not present in ae. longissima. only a portion of that gene, from 73 bp to  <dig>  bp was found in the  durum. this orf is significantly different in the alloplasmic line with  <dig> snps, three di-nucleotide changes, one tri-nucleotide change, and one triplet nucleotide insertion in regards to the t. turgidum’s copy of the orf. this appears to be the most polymorphic region found in the sequenced genomes when compared to the t. turgidum .

the t. turgidum, the  durum, and the ae. longissima genomes have  <dig> orfs,  <dig> orfs, and  <dig> orfs with sizes larger than 300 bp, respectively. these orfs consist of  <dig>  bp ,  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp  of the total genome size in each species, respectively. the alloplasmic line has the largest number of orfs compared to its parents and the highest percentage of total orf sequence per genome. to determine if there are species specific orfs, a comparison of the orfs was performed. there were  <dig> orfs in the  durum which are not present in the t. turgidum and the ae. longissima,  <dig> orfs present only in the ae. longissima, and  <dig> orfs only in the t. turgidum.

the orfs unique to the alloplasmic line are further described in table  <dig>  based on a mega blast search against the ncbi database orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> hit no similar sequences, possibly making them specific to this line. the orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> from the alloplasmic durum line are also present in the male sterile, alloplasmic line of t. aestivum <cit>  with 99% or more similarity . the orfs  <dig> and  <dig> are fully present in the alloplasmic t. aestivum <cit> , but only a portion of these orfs exist in normal common wheat. additionally, in male fertile and male sterile lines of the t. aestivum, orf <dig>  and orf <dig> are different from that found in the alloplasmic durum. based on its composition, orf <dig>  from the  durum is composed of fragments of other known and functional mitochondrial genes rps <dig>  cox <dig>  nad <dig> exon- <dig>  and rps19-p .table  <dig>

discussion
the chondriome is known to carry different types of mitochondrial genomes and showing polymorphism within each cell and tissue type  <cit> . most reports on heteroplasmy in plants are based on sequencing of a few genes or orfs  <cit> . the next generation sequencing method used in this study allowed deep sequencing with a range of 61-102x coverage in the mitochondrial genome of all three lines. this provided a clearer picture of heteroplasmy within each mtdna . heteroplasmy was observed in inter-genic space as well as genic space within each genome. most mtdna sequencing in wheat to date has been based on bac or large cosmid library construction  <cit> . this may make genome assembly easier due to the lower complexity of the data, but it also can limit the understanding of heteroplasmy and substoichiometric changes of the mitotypes in the chondriome.

this study provides for the first time a detailed analyses of an alloplasmic line of wheat in comparison to its two euplasmic nuclear and cytoplasmic donor lines. analysis of the mitochondrial genome of an alloplasmic wheat with the ae. kotschyi cytoplasm reported by liu and his colleagues  <cit>  lacked the sequence information of the genome from the euplasmic ae. kotschyi maternal line for a better comparison. reference assembly identified, several gaps in the mitochondrial genomes of the t. turgidum, the ae. longissima and the  durum as compared with that of the t. aestivum . genome rearrangements and structural changes were evident using the de novo assembly of the mitochondrial genomes of the three lines . mitochondrial genome of the alloplasmic line was not only distinct from the t. turgidum but also different from its maternal parent the ae. longissima. differences in gene order have not only been reported between different species of the same family, because of gene shuffling  <cit> , but also among different ecotypes of a single species such as arabidopsis <cit> . different genome structures have been observed comparing euplasmic lines with the cms lines in maize  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . structural changes between the three genomes were expected, but the degree of these changes, which occurred in less than  <dig> years for the  durum line, is quite significant. the rearrangements observed between the  durum and the ae. longissima mitochondrial genomes were greater than that observed for the t. turgidum and the t. aestivum, which are separated by  <dig>  years of evolution  <cit> . the ae. longissima mitochondrial genome has undergone a drastic structural change possibly as a result of introducing a new nuclear genome and production of a live alloplasmic line  <cit> .

in alloplasmic conditions, incompatibility between the encoded gene products from nucleus and mitochondria could lead to altered mitochondrial function. the enzymes of the inner mitochondrial membrane which contain subunits encoded from both mitochondria and nuclear genomes may not be compatible and less functional in the newly formed alloplasmic line  <cit> . this pressure in addition to possible changes in recombination, due to improper function of nuclear gene such as msh <dig> and reca <dig> <cit>  that control recombination in the mitochondrial genome, can lead to high frequency of heteroplasmy. the substoichiometric changes in favor of mitotypes that survive better in the new condition will accelerate evolution. this accelerated evolution of newly formed mitotypes can lead to multiple types different from the maternal mitochondrial genome in organization and genetic information, as found here and in other species  <cit> . therefore, in the alloplasmic cms lines, not only a larger number of newly formed mitotypes exist, but also the stoichiometric shift changes the predominant mitotype from the maternal type to the one best suited to the new condition  <cit> .

multiple synteny blocks were observed between different lines possibly indicating sites of recombination . studies on wheat mitochondrial gene expression indicated that nad <dig> and nad <dig>  are co-transcribed  <cit> . both genes were found to be present in block ii, despite the high structural differences observed. therefore, the co-existence of genes in the same block may be related to their functional association. at least  <dig> large repeated sequences exist in the wheat mitochondrial genome making it possible to have multiple sub-genomic circles in a cell. multiple genome rearrangements, likely caused by recombination in mitochondrial repeated sequences, would result in the conserved coding regions often flanked by different sequences  <cit> . the co-existence of different mitotypes in a cell after these rearrangements may have hampered the production of a contiguous assembly of the whole wheat mitochondrial genome. although reference assembly with the t. aestivum mitochondrial genome was possible for the t. turgidum, it was problematic for the other two lines. de novo assembly in these situations provided a better and more complete picture of the genome and its organization. the de novo assembly of mitochondrial genome was a challenge in our study due to the multipartite nature and rearrangements through recombination. the same difficulty was also faced by other groups using next generation sequencing of mitochondrial genome  <cit> . the de novo assembly using mira program followed by manual editing resulted in one contig of ~432 kb and two contigs with combined length of ~399 kb for the  durum and the ae. longissima, respectively. this emphasizes the necessity for developing more bioinformatics tools that are specific for mitochondrial genome analysis.

all previously characterized genes in the t. aestivum mitochondrial genome were present in the alloplasmic line and its parents. despite conservation in gene content, multiple genes showed considerable sequence differences. the alloplasmic durum and the ae. longissima line shared the same sequence variation in a number of genes such as atp6- <dig>  nad <dig>  rps19-p, cob and cox <dig> exon- <dig> when compared to the t. turgidum. the atp <dig> subunit of f0f <dig> – atp synthase is considered to be a mitochondrial encoded gene. early studies recognized the chimeric structure of atp <dig> in triticum species  <cit> . later, it was found that the presence of those chimeric versions were associated with cytoplasmic male sterility in rice, where proper rna editing of altered apt <dig> could restore male fertility  <cit> . the same differences in atp6- <dig>  nad <dig>  rps19-p, cob and cox <dig> exon  <dig> identified in this study have been reported by liu et al.  <cit>  in an alloplasmic line of t. aestivum with the cytoplasm of ae. kotschyi. these appear to be the common differences between the triticum and aegilops genera rather than being due to the cms condition as reported by kawaura  <cit>  for atp <dig> 

to confirm the allelic differences of atp <dig> between the  durum and its parental lines, a complimentary pcr was performed with specific primers for each allele after genome sequencing . it seems the alloplasmic and its euplasmic maintainer have both atp6-t and atp6-l versions of the gene. however, atp6-t version appears to be only present in the  durum nucleus rather than in mitochondria. the same situation seems valid for the presence of atp6-l in the t. turgidum nucleus. recently it has been shown that two versions of atp <dig> are present in the ae. crassa, t. aestivum cv. chinese spring and the alloplasmic line of chinese spring with the ae. crassa cytoplasm  <cit> . the atp6-cr  version in chinese spring and atp6-ae  version in the ae. crassa were present in less than 10% of the mitochondrial pool in the cell. however, the frequency of atp6-ae was 30% in the alloplasmic line possibly due to paternal leakage. there was no obvious amplification for atp6-t in the  durum or the ae. longissima mtdna and atp6-l in the t. turgidum mtdna . therefore, presence of a nuclear copy of both genes is likely.

three different alleles of nad <dig> were identified in this study. the allele found in the alloplasmic line is more similar to that of the paternal t. turgidum line than the ae. longissima. this provides another evidence of paternal leakage during the creation of the alloplasmic line. paternal leakage and its contribution to heteroplasmy has been indicated by numerous studies . in wheat paternal leakage was investigated in detail in the alloplasmic hexaploid wheat having ae. crassa cytoplasm  <cit> . it seems the proportion of paternal genes in the alloplasmic line increases by each backcrossing with the paternal line and then remains at a constant level  <cit> . the sequence of nad <dig> in the  durum has similarities to both parents. therefore, this copy of nad <dig> not only shows paternal leakage but also suggests that a recombination between the maternal and paternal mitochondrial genomes may have occurred. since the ae. longissima copy of the gene is absent in the  durum, paternal leakage was either high for this gene and/or the nucleus of the t. turgidum selected in favor of the recombinant version which was similar to its own. it is known that nuclear genes determine the stoichiometry of alternative mitotypes  <cit> . therefore, the second reason is most likely to be valid.

two genes, rpl <dig> and ccmb were missing in the final assembly of the  durum. the rpl <dig> gene encodes a ribosomal protein, responsible for rrna maturation and formation of the 60s ribosomal subunits. its function could be critical to the survival of the alloplasmic line. both rpl <dig> and ccmb genes were present in the raw assembly data but not included in the final assembly. in a recent study on sequencing the mitochondrial genome of a cms line of t. aestivum, the lack of rpl <dig> gene was associated with the cms phenotype  <cit> . the lack of this gene in the final assemblies of the  durum in our study and the  alloplasmic line  <cit>  may be related to the proportion of mitochondrial dna carrying that gene by means of substoichiometric shifting  <cit> . it is possible that the rpl <dig> gene exists in a mitotype which is in a much smaller proportion compared to the major mitotype in the cell.

besides major changes discussed, a nucleotide polymorphism search was performed within known mitochondrial genes in the sequenced species. out of six snps observed between the  durum and the ae. longissima, three were in ribosomal protein coding genes rps <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig>  nucleotide variation within ribosomal genes was also observed in the alloplasmic line of t. aestivum, where among other, differences in rps <dig>  and rps <dig> were recognized  <cit> . this indicates that ribosomal genes are the possible “hot spots” for mutation in alloplasmic lines. since ribosomal proteins are responsible for protein expression, these differences may be important to our understanding of cms phenotype in plants. these findings suggest the possibility of creating potential snp based markers to investigate other cytoplasm in alloplasmic lines of wheat. the functional effect of nucleotide variation in cox <dig>  rps <dig>  and mttb gene was evaluated in comparison to a. thaliana, zea perennis, t. aestivum and oryza sativa sub. indica . amino acid variations found in these genes are common among various plant species except for the change in rps <dig> leading to an amino acid change unique to the alloplasmic line. this data supports the hypothesis of accelerated evolutionary changes in alloplasmic lines observed here and in another study  <cit> .

nucleotide polymorphism could be detected within each chondriome and categorized as single hsnps and hsnp blocks. the hsnp blocks within each chondriome is an indicator of heteroplasmy in each genome and could possibly be used to investigate the proportion of particular mitotype in the genome. overall mitochondrial genome polymorphism comparison between chondriome of each line showed an expected result that the alloplasmic line is closer to the ae. longissima than to the t. turgidum. in the alloplasmic durum line, one particular region of dna, designated as orf <dig> <cit> , showed the highest level of polymorphism compared to other regions of the genome. gene content and order showed that orf <dig> does not exist in the cytoplasm donor line, but was completely conserved  among the t. aestivum and the t. turgidum genomes. existence of orf <dig> in the alloplasmic durum line is additional evidence for paternal leakage, although it was highly mutated. since the  durum line has been developed through a complicated backcrossing scheme including the  t. aestivum cv. selkirk and the t. timopheevii <cit> , the impact of these changes may have influenced the new orf composition. sequencing of the t. timopheevii mitochondrial genome can provide a better insight to these observations.

several open reading frames specific to the alloplasmic line were detected, implying that alloplasmic condition can lead to creation of new orfs. these new orfs can contribute to cms and other characteristic phenotypes in the  durum line. interestingly, orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> from the alloplasmic durum line were also observed in the alloplasmic hexaploid wheat containing the ae. kotchyi cytoplasm  <cit> . the occurrence of these orfs might be related to the alloplasmic condition for they were not present in the maternal lines. as both alloplasmic lines having these orfs are cms, it is possible that their existence are associated with the cms condition. the most characteristic orf recognized in this study was chimeric orf <dig>  composed entirely of four fragments of other mitochondrial genes, including rps <dig>  cox <dig>  nad4- <dig>  and rps19-p. expression of a new chimeric orf “orf72” in wild cabbage has been found to be related to the cms phenotype  <cit> . this orf contained parts of atp <dig> and expressed in cms line, but not in the euplasmic line. it was also found that expression of orf224/atp <dig> chimeric gene is correlated with cms trait in brassica napus <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
next generation sequencing technologies are powerful tools to study the heteroplasmy and substoichiometric changes of mitochondrial genomes in chondriome of plants, especially alloplasmic lines. several heteroplasmic regions were observed within genes and also intergenic regions. the amount of structural changes in the  durum lines was considerably higher than its cytoplasm donor. the rearrangements and nucleotide changes in the mitochondrial genome of the alloplasmic line that occurred in less than half a century was greater than the changes observed between mitochondrial genome of the t. turgidum and the t. aestivum which remained almost intact for  <dig> centuries of evolution. evidence of paternal leakage was also observed by analyzing nad <dig> and orf <dig> among all three lines. the significance of changes in the genes received from the paternal donor emphasizes that other mechanisms such as recombination, mutation, and substoichiometric shifts are active in the alloplasmic condition. together the newly formed orfs, differences in gene sequences and copy numbers, heteroplasmy and substoichiometric changes demonstrate the potential of the alloplasmic condition to accelerate evolution towards forming new mitochondrial genomes. inducing changes in the chondriome and selection for the best mitotypes that fit the growing conditions would definitely broaden the paths for crop improvement in the future.
