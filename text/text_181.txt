BACKGROUND
mastitis caused by escherichia coli  is a common disease in lactating dairy cows. during infection, lipopolysaccharide  released from the cell wall of e. coli rapidly induces a sophisticated inflammatory response. locally it is characterized by recruiting leukocytes especially neutrophils to the injured mammary tissue, as well as activation of macrophages in the mammary gland to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . these pro-inflammatory cytokines include tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin- <dig>  and interleukin- <dig> , which have profound roles in the inflammatory response. systemic consequences are observed as the acute phase response  phenomena such as fever, leukocytosis and altered plasma concentration of acute phase proteins . lps is a highly potent activator of the pro-inflammatory response during e. coli infection and is often used to simulate the gram negative mastitis. it provokes secretion of above pro-inflammatory cytokines which in turn activate or suppress expression of acute phase genes in hepatocytes, vascular endothelium and other target cells  <cit> . although some extra-hepatic production occurs  <cit> , the liver is thought to be the major contributor to the app in the blood. apr is also commonly accompanied by a widespread change of metabolism  <cit> .

the contribution of the liver to the circulating levels of cytokines and app in vivo in cattle is not fully understood. in cattle, in vitro studies using kupffer cells  have shown an important contribution of liver to the cytokine production  <cit> . in vitro, recombinant bovine cytokines can stimulate the secretion of haptoglobin  from bovine hepatocytes  <cit> . furthermore, synthesis of serum amyloid a  was shown to be mainly regulated by tnf-α, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and glucocorticoid via a network of transcription factors and antagonists  <cit> . our previous study shows that liver has a great capacity to produce both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and app when dairy cows are infused lps intra-mammary   <cit> . all these studies suggest a strong connection between cytokines activity and app production in cattle during inflammation.

the biological functions of app such as hp and saa in the apr are only partly known. although the app is highly conserved during evolution  <cit> , their presence and importance differ among animal species. the significantly elevated app expression in liver and increased concentration in blood and milk during udder infection indicate a crucial role of these proteins in the host's anti-pathogen response to mastitis  <cit> . other genes involved in the energy metabolism, integrity and function of hepatocytes are also expected to be regulated in the liver during the apr, and may influence the induction, kinetics and clinical outcome of the apr to lps induced inflammation in dairy cows  <cit> .

to gain a better insight into the genes and pathways involved in hepatic apr in dairy cows, we performed a global gene expression analysis of liver tissue sampled at different time points relative to intra-mammary exposure to lps treatment.

RESULTS
of the  <dig> target transcripts measured by the microarray approximately 20% were differentially expressed  at one or more time points relative to lps treatment. a heatmap of the  <dig> de transcripts is shown in figure  <dig>  these transcripts were grouped into eight clusters and the average expression profile of each cluster is shown in figure  <dig>  most transcripts exhibit a single upward or downward wave with the expression of  <dig> transcripts increased  and  <dig> transcripts decreased , respectively, over the time course measured. however some transcripts showed a bimodal expression pattern between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after lps treatment . transcripts from clusters  <dig> and  <dig> responded rapidly within  <dig> hours after lps treatment. the majority of transcripts exhibited a maximal deviation from baseline at 6– <dig> hours post lps infusion . most transcripts returned to baseline at  <dig> hours after lps treatment.

overrepresentation of gene sets defined by the biological process  of gene ontology  was tested within each cluster. the bps shown in figure  <dig> was overrepresented in at least one cluster . cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> transcripts and the average expression was characterized by a rapid increase within  <dig> hours after lps treatment that is followed by a quick return to the baseline . a significant proportion of the genes in this cluster are involved in immune and inflammatory responses , chemotaxis , cyclooxygenase pathway  and macrophage differentiation . it includes genes encoding il- <dig> alpha and beta, chemokine  ligand  <dig> , chemokine  ligand  <dig> , ligand  <dig> , prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase  <dig> , colony stimulating factor  <dig>  and ccaat/enhancer binding protein delta . cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> transcripts whose maximum expression occurred at 9– <dig> hours . the overrepresented bp are phosphorylation  and negative regulation of receptor mediated endocytosis . this cluster includes toll interacting protein , cd <dig>  epidermal growth-factor receptor , signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , amp-activated protein kinase beta  <dig> non-catalytic subunit  as well as hp. cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> transcripts whose expression increased  <dig> hours after lps infusion and have a maximum expression at  <dig> to  <dig> hours . involved bp are cytokine and chemokine mediated signaling pathway , positive regulation of inflammatory response , negative regulation of signal transduction , heterophilic cell adhesion  and apoptosis . the de transcripts include the genes encoding toll-like receptor  <dig> , tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1a , member  <dig> tnfrsf <dig>  interleukin  <dig> receptor antagonist , myeloid differentiation primary response gene  <dig> , nf-kappab  transcription factor p <dig> subunit , nf-kappab inhibitor alpha , activating protein- <dig> ap <dig> , suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig>  and app saa <dig> and alpha- <dig> acid glycoprotein  as well as intercellular adhesion molecule  <dig> , peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator  <dig> alpha  and scavenger receptor class b, member  <dig> . cluster <dig> contains  <dig> transcripts whose expression was down regulated with a minimum at  <dig> to  <dig> hours after lps administration . the enriched biological processes are related to the amino acid metabolic process , glucose metabolic process , lipid metabolic process , fatty acid metabolic process , steroid biosynthetic process  and proteolysis . among the genes in this cluster are phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  <dig> , glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit , corticosteroid-binding globulin  precursor and prolactin receptor , as well as complement component 4-binding protein, beta  and mannose-binding lectin . cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> transcripts which were up regulated temporarily from  <dig> to  <dig> hours  and return to the baseline within  <dig> hours. the involved biological processes are response to dna damage stimulus , activation of pro-apoptotic gene products  and dna metabolism . the de transcripts include the gene encoding chemokine  ligand . cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> transcripts which were down regulated temporarily between  <dig> to  <dig> hours and returned to the baseline within  <dig> hours . cytoskeletal anchoring  was found overrepresented and this cluster includes genes encoding 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase , suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig>  and hepatocyte nuclear factor  <dig>  alpha. cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> transcripts. the expression profile of these genes is bimodal and is characterized by a decrease from  <dig> to  <dig> hours followed by a rapid increase from  <dig> to  <dig> hours and then returning to baseline at  <dig> hours . genes involved in cellular homeostasis  and mitochondrial transport along microtubule  are overrepresented. cluster  <dig> contained  <dig> transcripts which rapidly declined within  <dig> hours . regulation of transcription by rna polymerase ii promoter  and regulation of transcription  are the overrepresented biological processes and it includes ccaat/enhancer binding protein alpha .

the performance and sensitivity of the microarray analysis was validated against quantitative pcr  performed on the same liver tissue samples  <cit> . seven inflammatory markers including the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> and the app hp, saa <dig> and agp were tested. all markers, except agp were found to be significantly up regulated when measured using q-pcr  <cit> . the expression profiles from the microarray showed the same trends as q-pcr for most investigated markers except agp and il- <dig> . among the cytokines il-1β and il- <dig> were significantly up regulated on the microarray, but not tnf-α and il- <dig>  to ensure a low false discovery rate we have chosen to adjust for multiple testing using the stringent bonferroni method. this means that some genes with significantly low raw p-values which is the case for tnf-α and il- <dig> will be deemed non differentially expressed after adjusting for multiple testing although the expression profile of tnf-α is very similar to that observed by q-pcr. also the two technologies have different sensitivity, because q-pcr has a 40-cycle amplification while the affymetrix array is loaded with crna that is amplified normally no more than  <dig> cycles. this means that inflammatory cytokine which normally are present in picogram or nanogram in blood and liver are easier detected using q-pcr. in contrast, the app that often are present in microgram or milligram in the blood of diseased individuals, were all found to be significantly up regulated on the microarray.

discussion
this study presents the first global gene expression profiling of the hepatic apr in dairy cows following intra-mammary exposure to lps. clinical findings  in the milk, temporary leukopenia, leukocytosis) verified the induction of mastitis inflammation by lps. the bovine array data strongly support that the hepatic apr is triggered by the activation of the signaling pathways that are involved with common and hepatic-specific transcription factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. these mediators in turn stimulates or represses the expression of genes encoding app, collectins, complement components, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules and key metabolic enzymes during apr. hormones, anti-inflammatory and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis  linked mediators also seem to participate in the modification of apr. the alteration of these acute phase genes is thought to be responsible for the observed systemic apr phenomena.

the overall gene expression pattern of the hepatic apr in dairy cows depicts what has been found in other animal lps models such as mice, canine and sheep using different lps application routes. in the liver of mice given intraperitoneal  lps there was an up regulation of genes involved in defense and immunity, and intracellular signaling while genes involved in metabolism of fatty acid, bile acid and cholesterol were down regulated  <cit> . similar findings in the liver of intravenous  lps-challenged sheep  <cit>  and canine  <cit>  suggests that the changes in the gene expression we have in the bovine liver during apr is a common response in mammalian species. in the following sections, changes in individual gene expressions in lps challenged dairy cows will be discussed in relation to the existing and general knowledge of the hepatic apr.

initiation of apr in liver
lps im infusion induces systemic apr, which in the liver is associated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the activated macrophages. cd <dig> and tlr <dig> are the cell membrane proteins which bind lps and may trigger the signaling pathways of macrophages activation  <cit> . tlr <dig> also has a recognizable role in the inflammatory activation of liver shown in mice by i.p. lps treatment  <cit> . tlr2-myd <dig> elicits the signaling cascades that activate ap <dig> and nfkb  <cit> . the latter promotes the transcription of il- <dig> and tnf-α  <cit> . we observed that the expressions of tlr <dig>  myd <dig>  ap <dig> and p <dig> subunit  of nfkb complex, its inhibitor , both il-1α and il-1β, and il- <dig> receptor antagonist il1rn were all up regulated. although the increased expression of il- <dig> and tnf-α is less dramatic when measured using the microarray, it is significant using q-pcr  <cit> . increased expression was also observed in the cytokine receptors like tnfrsf1a and tnfrsf <dig> , and the component of receptor pathway such as tollip, which is an essential element of the il- <dig> receptor signaling pathway  <cit> .

hormones are another family of key mediators involved in apr. we found a decreased expression of prolactin receptor , similar to that shown in hepatic tissue after i.p. lps injection  <cit> . prl induced stat <dig>  <cit>  which however was up regulated in our study. one explanation is that in the liver stat <dig> is also inducible by growth hormone , il- <dig> family cytokines and epidermal growth factor   <cit> , and we did observe increased expression of the egf receptor. activated stat <dig> can enhance the transcription of c/ebps and ap <dig>  which both are important transcription factors controlling the production of app and other inflammatory genes such as scarb <dig> that participates in the clearance of lps in the liver  <cit> . we observed an elevated expression of c/ebpδ, ap <dig> and scarb <dig>  in addition, socs <dig> and socs <dig>  the attenuator of stat <dig> mediated signal transduction, were also altered.

it seems apr predominantly relies on the activation of signaling pathways involved with transcription factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. and it may subject to the modification by the hormones via the corresponding receptors. the coordination of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators such as inhibitors or antagonists also participated and may provide the host with a state of "high alert" in which the immune response can be efficiently initiated if the infection progresses, and restrained if the infection is resolved or becomes excessive or prolonged.

hpaa and apr in liver
fever was observed in the cows after lps challenge and as a physiological stress, it can lead to the change of serum cortisol levels. prostaglandin  e <dig> has a profound role in thermoregulation during infection  <cit> . in lps-induced fever, first febrile phase  is triggered by the activation of pge <dig> synthesis mainly in macrophages in liver and lung  <cit> . pge <dig> is synthesized via the cyclooxygenase pathway in which cox- <dig> is the key enzyme. we found increased expression of cox- <dig> in the liver within  <dig> hours after lps im infusion. in fact, apr represents a cross-talk between the peripheral inflammation and central nervous system  <cit> . during infection hpaa is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and influences the inflammation by releasing glucocorticoids such as cortisol  <cit> . the majority of cortisol in serum is bound to cbg and is biological inactive  <cit> . we observed a decreased expression of cbg in the bovine liver and studies of human hepg <dig> cell in vitro showed that pro-inflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> can decrease cbg synthesis  <cit> . the expected outcome is increased levels of unbound  cortisol in serum in response to the local inflammation in the mammary gland. it suggests that hpaa linked mediators  may respond to the expression change of acute phase genes in liver.

expression of app
app is one of the most important products of the liver during the infection. we observed that the expression of major positive app such as saa <dig>  hp and agp were all up regulated. no significant change was observed in c-reactive protein, shown to be less responsive in cattle as compared to human, pigs and dogs during the acute infection  <cit> . saa, hp and agp are class i app which dependent on il-1-nfkb signaling pathway and contain c/ebp binding sites in their promoter regions  <cit> . in our study c/ebpδ was elevated while c/ebpα was decreased less than  <dig> hours after lps treatment confirming the inverse relationship between these transcription factors during apr  <cit> . stat <dig>  a class ii acute phase gene , was also up regulated is known to stimulate the transcription of c/ebps as described previously and thereby affecting expression of the app indirectly. the increased expression of common  and hepatic-selective  transcription factors suggests that the expression of app is controlled by a network of transcription factors involving both classes of the acute phase genes.

it is also notable that some app from the complement pathway or collectin family, for example mbl, was down regulated. studies in humans have shown that il- <dig> can suppress the mbl expression  <cit> . another example is c4bpb, a crucial regulator in both the classical and lectin pathways. expression levels of up stream regulators of c4bpb such as hnf- <dig> and pfkfb <dig>  <cit>  were suppressed, which may explain the decreased expression of c4bpb we observed in the bovine liver during the apr. complement components  and collectins are considered as the first line of defense against pathogen invasion. however in our study, lps was infused into the mammary gland and decreased expression of collectins and cc may be due to the absence of direct binding to the foreign surface antigen.

leukocytes recruitment and activation
leukocytosis was observed in the lps treated cows and correspondingly we also observed an increased expression of genes, which play a key role in leukocytes migration and activation in the liver. among those genes are 1) chemokines: macrophage inflammatory protein , monocyte chemotactic proteins  and neutrophil-activating protein nap-3/cxcl1; 2) cell-adhesion molecules : icam-1; and 3) other cell surface molecules and colony stimulating factors: cd <dig> and csf- <dig>  cd <dig> plays an essential role in migration of leukocytes particularly neutrophils  <cit> , and it is a marker of early lymphocyte activation  <cit> . csf- <dig> is central to the regulation of production, maintenance and function of macrophages  <cit> . nfkb and myd <dig>  which are responsible for inducing the expression of many of the above mentioned chemokines and cam  <cit> , were also up regulated suggesting their crucial role in hepatic leukocytes migration and activation.

metabolism and apr
a large group of metabolism genes were down regulated in the bovine liver in response to im lps infusion. of particular interest was the increased expression of prkab <dig>  a regulatory subunit of amp-activated protein kinase , as recent findings show that ampk plays a major role in the control of hepatic metabolism  <cit> . activation of ampk leads to inhibition of glucose production and we did indeed observe decreased expression of the gluconeogenic key enzymes pck <dig> and g6pc and their transcriptional co-activator pgc-1α  <cit> . moreover, down regulation of the expression of pck <dig> and g6pc by stat <dig>  <cit>  whose expression levels was increased in our study, indicates that the hepatic metabolism may also be influenced by transcription factors from the signaling pathways in apr. signaling gene networks were also shown to be coordinately regulated in the liver of periparturient cows in response to ketosis  <cit> . in general our results does support the findings that the inflammatory response affects metabolism in dairy cows  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
performing global gene expression analysis on liver tissue from im lps treated cows verified that the liver plays a major role in the apr of e. coli mastitis, and that the bovine hepatic apr follows the same pattern as other mammals when they are challenged with lps. our work presents the first insight into the dynamic changes in gene expression in the liver that influences the induction, kinetics and clinical outcome of the apr in dairy cows.
