BACKGROUND
plastids are endosymbiotically derived organelles, and their evolutionary histories are complicated due to multiple endosymbiotic events. plants and three algal groups  acquired plastids through a single primary endosymbiosis between a heterotrophic protist and a photosynthetic cyanobacterium, and we refer to the plastids originating from this process as primary plastids  <cit> . in contrast, many other algae  and apicomplexan parasites possess complex plastids. these are called secondary plastids, which evolved through endosymbiotic uptakes of red and green algae by distinct protists  <cit> . multiple secondary endosymbioses led to the phylogenetic diversity of the current plastid-bearing organisms  <cit> . in terms of structures, primary and secondary plastids are distinct in the number of envelope membranes. primary plastids are surrounded by two membranes, whereas secondary plastids have one or two additional membranes; euglenophyte and dinoflagellate plastids are bounded by three membranes, and the others have four membranes  <cit> . in four membrane-bound secondary plastids, the two innermost membranes are regarded as descendants of the primary plastid membranes of the engulfed alga, and the two outermost membranes are suggested to be the former phagosomal membrane of the host and the relict plasma membrane of the endosymbiont, respectively  <cit> . the outermost membrane is connected to the endoplasmic reticulum  in some secondary plastids of red algal origin, and the recent er-enclosure model has proposed that the outer pair of membranes are derived from the host er  <cit> . these additional membranes should be a barrier for transport of nucleus-encoded plastid proteins as well as for metabolite exchange. thus, secondary plastid-bearing organisms had to evolve transport mechanisms for breaking through the membranes  <cit> . furthermore, in terms of plastid division, new mechanisms would be necessary for constriction of the additional membranes in secondary plastids.

primary plastid division is performed by the simultaneous constriction of the two envelope membranes at the division site, which is mediated by a ring-like division complex encompassing both the inside and the outside of the two membranes  <cit> . consistent with the origin of primary plastids, protein components of the division complex on the stromal side are typically descended from cyanobacterial cell division proteins, and several host-derived proteins comprise the cytoplasmic portion  <cit> . in plants and algae, prior to the onset of plastid division, the tubulin-like gtpase ftsz assembles into a ring-like structure on the stromal surface of the inner plastid membrane at the division site . in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana, the ftsz ring  is tethered to the inner plastid membrane via an interaction with the integral membrane protein arc <dig>  <cit> , and the positioning of the z ring is regulated by several stromal proteins, mind  <cit> , mine  <cit> , arc <dig>  <cit> , and mcd <dig>  <cit> . subsequently, the stromal plastid division proteins directly or indirectly recruit cytoplasmic components of the division complex, including the outer membrane proteins pdv <dig> and pdv <dig>  <cit> , and the dynamin-related gtpase drp5b  that assembles into a ring-like structure on the cytoplasmic portion  <cit> . two self-assembling gtpases, ftsz and drp5b, are thought to generate contractile force for membrane constriction  <cit> . in earlier electron microscopic studies, electron-dense ring structures, called the plastid-dividing  rings, were observed at the plastid division site on both the stromal and the cytoplasmic surface of the plastid membranes in plants and algae  <cit> . a recent study showed that the outer pd ring of the primitive red alga cyanidioschyzon merolae is composed of polyglucan filaments  <cit> , and filament sliding mediated by drp5b  may generate a contractile force for membrane constriction  <cit> . the principal feature of the plant-like plastid division mechanism seems to be widely conserved in primary plastid-bearing algae that have homologs of plastid division proteins  <cit> . however, some plastid division proteins are depleted in certain algal lineages  <cit> . for example, the glaucophyte cyanophora paradoxa genome does not encode any known plastid division proteins of host origin, and constriction of the outer membrane appears to rely on the peptidoglycan hydrolyzing activity with dipm, as in cyanobacterial cell division  <cit> . the genome of the red alga c. merolae encodes only two plant-like plastid division proteins, ftsz and drp5b, and it remains unknown how positioning of the plastid division complex at the division site is regulated.

several homologous genes of primary plastid division proteins have also been identified in whole genomes of secondary plastid-bearing organisms  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig> , homologous genes for ftsz, mind, mine, and/or drp5b, were found in the heterokonts thalassiosira pseudonana, phaeodactylum tricornutum, and aureococcus anophagefferens, the haptophyte emiliania huxleyi, and the cryptophyte guillardia theta based on blast surveys. these homologous genes are assumed to be derived from the engulfed red algae via secondary endosymbioses. plastid division proteins are mostly encoded by the nuclear genomes as the result of endosymbiotic gene transfer, whereas the mind and mine of g. theta and the mind of e. huxleyi are encoded by the plastid genomes  <cit> , and g. theta ftsz gene is found in the nucleomorph genome that is a relict nuclear genome of the red algal endosymbiont  <cit> . localization studies on secondary plastid division proteins are limited to a few organisms. green fluorescent protein -tagged experiments confirmed that ftsz proteins of the diatom chaetoceros negogracile carried an n-terminal plastid targeting signal  <cit> , and immunofluorescence localization revealed that the t. pseudonana drp5b formed a ring-like structure at the putative plastid division site  <cit> . thus, constriction of the inner pair of secondary plastid membranes appears to be achieved by a portion of the primary plastid division complex that is derived from the engulfed endosymbiont. although it is uncertain how the outer pair of secondary plastid membranes are divided, a study of apicomplexan parasites has shed light on this problem. apicomplexans have non-photosynthetic secondary plastids  that are surrounded by four membranes. van dooren et al.  reported that a dynamin-related protein of toxoplasma gondii  localized to punctate regions on the apicoplast surface and it was essential for apicoplast division  <cit> . the drpa is an apicomplexan-specific gene that is phylogenetically distinct from the drp5b genes of primary plastid-bearing organisms. interestingly, apicomplexans lack any homologous genes of primary plastid division proteins including ftsz and drp5b, suggesting that apicomplexans have lost the primary plastid division machinery and developed a new mechanism mediated by drpa  <cit> . to date, few proteins have been characterized as a portion of the mechanism of secondary plastid division, furthermore, the whole picture of secondary plastid division is still unrevealed.table  <dig> distribution of homologous genes for plastid division proteins

to gain insight into secondary plastid division mechanisms, we investigated homologs of primary plastid division proteins in chlorarachniophyte algae that obtained secondary plastids by the uptake of a green alga. chlorarachniophyte plastids are surrounded by four membranes. each plastid possesses a relict nucleus  of the endosymbiont in the periplastidal compartment between the inner and the outer pair of membranes, and the existence of the nucleomorph would make plastid division more complicated  <cit> . genome sequencing has been completed in the chlorarachniophyte bigelowiella natans, including the nuclear genome  <cit> , nucleomorph  <cit> , and plastid  <cit> . a previous proteomic study identified two nucleus-encoded ftsz homologs in isolated b. natans plastids  <cit> . in this study, we report detailed subcellular localization and periodic gene expression pattern for two ftsz proteins, named ftszd- <dig> and ftszd- <dig>  in the chlorarachniophyte b. natans. our findings suggest that the ftszd proteins are involved in partial constriction of the two innermost plastid membranes, but not in the whole process of plastid division. it is uncertain how the outer pair of plastid membranes is constricted, and as-yet-unknown components are required for secondary plastid division in chlorarachniophytes.

RESULTS
sequences of plastid division protein ftszd in chlorarachniophytes
to identify homologous genes of primary plastid division proteins in chlorarachniophytes, we surveyed b. natans genomes by reciprocal blast with corresponding known sequences of arabidopsis thaliana, chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and cyanidioschyzon merolae  <cit> . two homologous genes for ftsz proteins were found in the b. natans nuclear genome as reported previously  <cit> , but the others for arc <dig>  minc, mind, mine, drp5b, pdv, arc <dig>  mcd <dig>  and pdr <dig> were not detected . two types of ftsz genes, named ftszd- <dig> and ftszd- <dig>  were also identified in rnaseq transcriptome data from four chlorarachniophytes, amorphochlora amoebiformis, chlorarachnion reptans, gymnochlora sp. , and lotharella globosa. all of these ftszd proteins were composed of an n-terminal leader, a highly conserved ftsz domain, and a variable c-terminal region . the n-terminal leaders were predicted to be a typical plastid targeting signal consisting of an er targeting signal peptide and a transit peptide-like sequence  by signalp  <dig>   <cit>  and chlorop  <dig>   <cit>  programs. to confirm the plastid targeting ability of the n-terminal leaders, we performed gfp-based experiments using the transient transformation system of a. amoebiformis. gfp fusion proteins with an n-terminal leader of a. amoebiformis ftszd proteins  were imported into the plastid stroma . the c-terminal regions of ftszd proteins were divergent in sequence and length, whereas their c-terminal ends were mostly conserved among ftszd- <dig> and ftszd- <dig> proteins; the c-terminal conserved motif of ftszd- <dig> is ‘t-l-r/g-g-k-a-k-r-x-a-g-x-x-l-r-r/k-a/v-l-g’ and that of ftszd- <dig> is ‘g-l-g-g-w-w-y-w-w-r-n’ .fig.  <dig> alignment of n- and c-terminal sequences of chlorarachniophyte ftszd proteins. a the n-terminal leaders are predicted to consist of a signal peptide and a transit peptide-like sequence. identical amino acids within the highly conserved ftsz domains are boxed in black, and the c-terminal conserved motifs are highlighted with red boxes. the ftszd- <dig> sequences of chlorarachnion and lotharella lack their n-terminal ends.  confocal images of amorphochlora amoebiformis cells expressing gfp fused with the n-terminal leader of aaftszd- <dig> and aaftszd- <dig>  the images show red chlorophyll autofluorescence of plastids and green fluorescence of gfp. the pyrenoid  is a part of plastid stroma that has no chlorophyll autofluorescence. the scale bars represent 5 μm



two previous phylogenetic studies reported that chlorarachniophyte ftsz genes appear to be derived from a red algal lineage despite the green algal origin of chlorarachniophyte plastids  <cit> . to examine the evolutionary process of the two types of ftsz genes in chlorarachniophytes, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree using prokaryotic and eukaryotic ftsz sequences with eight chlorarachniophyte ftsz sequences. the tree indicated the monophyly of chlorarachniophyte ftsz genes, which were closely related to a sequence of the haptophyte emiliania huxleyi bearing a red algal secondary plastid, and the ftszd- <dig> and ftszd- <dig> genes are robustly separated into two clades . this result strongly suggested that the duplication of ftszd- <dig> and ftszd- <dig> occurred before the divergence of chlorarachniophyte species, whereas the red origin of chlorarachniophyte ftszd genes was not well supported by our analyses.fig.  <dig> unrooted phylogenetic tree representing the diversity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic ftsz. the topology correspond to the best-scoring ml tree as obtained with raxml. the values at nodes indicate the ml bootstrap supports  and bayesian posterior probabilities  when they are higher than 50 % and  <dig> , respectively. bold lines correspond to ≥95 % bp and  <dig>  pp. genbank/jgi/mmetsp accession numbers are shown on the right side of species names. the scale bar represents the estimated number of amino acid substitutions per site



subcellular localization of chlorarachniophyte ftszd proteins
to determine the detailed subcellular localization of chlorarachniophyte ftszd proteins, we first examined the full-length of aaftszd- <dig>  and aaftszd- <dig>  fused with gfp. unfortunately their localization was ambiguous and we observed no obvious accumulation of gfp at the plastid division site, probably due to an artifact of high expression of the gfp tagged proteins. therefore, we generated polyclonal antibodies against b. natans ftszd proteins  to perform immunolocalization experiments. b. natans typically has a single plastid in the tiny cell, which has an advantage in ultrastructural studies by electron microscopy. the b. natans plastids typically possess a projecting pyrenoid with a plate-like invagination of the two innermost membranes, and a nucleomorph is located near the pyrenoid base  <cit> . the specificity of two antibodies was examined by immunoblot analyses against the whole proteins extracted from b. natans cells; the detected bands were consistent with the predicted size of mature proteins of bnftszd- <dig>  and bnftszd- <dig>  . we first performed immunofluorescence microscopy. fluorescein isothiocyanate  signals were observed at the midpoint of the bilobate plastids in both of the anti-bnftszd- <dig> and anti-bnftszd- <dig> , and cytoplasmic signals would be a nonspecific background, because such signals were also observed in negative control cells treated with pre-immune serums . furthermore, we carried out immunoelectron microscopy using these two antibodies. in both cases, conjugated gold particles were observed near the tip of the shallow invagination of the two innermost plastid membranes within projecting pyrenoids , on opposite sides of the pyrenoid on horizontal sections , on the innermost membrane in the central narrow part of the bilobate plastids near the nucleomorph , and in a vertical line on the bottom of the bilobate plastids . immunogold signals for both bnftszd proteins were almost always detected at the plastid midpoints in observed cells. taken together, these findings indicated that bnftszd- <dig> and bnftszd- <dig> assembled into a gourd-shaped ring structure on the stromal side of the innermost membrane at the midpoint of bilobate plastids, and the ring always associates with a shallow plate-like invagination of the inner pair of plastid membranes . in our electron microscopic observation, electron-dense pd-rings were not detected at the putative plastid division sites where immunogold particles were located.fig.  <dig> immunoblot analyses and immunofluorescence microscopy of bnftszd- <dig> and bnftszd- <dig> proteins. immunoblot analyses of anti-bnftszd- <dig>  and anti-bnftszd- <dig>  antibodies against the whole proteins extracted from b. natans cells.  confocal images of immunofluorescence labeling of bnftszd- <dig> and bnftszd- <dig> with fitc  in b. natans cells. pre-immune serums were used as negative controls. the chlorophyll autofluorescence of plastids is shown by red. py, pyrenoid. the scale bars represent 2 μm

transcription pattern of ftszd genes during the cell cycle
in unicellular algae with a single plastid, plastid division is generally regulated by the host cell cycle, and transcription of nucleus-encoded plastid division proteins is generally restricted to the s, g <dig>  or m phase, when plastids divide prior to cytokinesis. transcripts of plastidal ftsz genes are known to accumulate during the s phase of the red alga c. merolae  <cit>  and a couple of green algae  <cit> , and during the s/g <dig> phase of the secondary plastid-bearing diatom seminavis robusta  <cit> . to clarify the relationship between the timing of ftsz gene expression and host cell division in chlorarachniophytes, we examined the transcription levels of bnftszd genes during the cell cycle using synchronized b. natans culture. cell division was synchronized by pretreatment of continuous light deprivation for 36 h followed by a 12:12 h light:dark cycle; cell division occurred during the second dark phase . total rna was extracted at 4 h intervals during the second light and dark, and third light phase, and we calculated mrna transcription levels of bnftszd- <dig> and bnftszd- <dig> using real-time quantitative pcr . transcription levels of both genes increased soon after cell division in the late dark phase . the transcription level of bnftszd- <dig> reached a peak at the end of the dark phase corresponding to the host m/g <dig> phase, whereas the peak of bnftszd- <dig> was 4 h before that of bnftszd- <dig>  both bnftsz genes appeared to be regulated by the host cell cycle. unlike other unicellular algae, however, the transcription pattern of chlorarachniophyte ftszd genes is not consistent with the timing of plastid division that occurs before the cytokinesis. when the mrna transcription ratio between bnftszd- <dig> and bnftszd- <dig> was simply calculated by ct values of rt-qpcr at their peaks , the maximum transcription level of bnftszd- <dig> was  <dig> -fold higher than that of bnftszd- <dig>  this suggests that two bnftszd proteins might exist in the plastids in different molecular amounts.fig.  <dig> transcription of bnftszd genes during the cell cycle. a cell densities  in the synchronized b. natans culture determined by cell counting; error bars represent standard deviations calculated based on six independent measurements.  relative transcription levels of bnftszd- <dig> and bnftszd- <dig> genes detected using real-time quantitative pcr for a total of  <dig> time points . each transcription level was normalized against a transcription level of the reference gene 18s rrna. error bars represent standard deviations of triplicate experiments



discussion
prospective function of ftszd proteins in chlorarachniophytes
one previous ultrastructural study of the chlorarachniophyte b. natans has shown that divisions of the plastid and the nucleomorph take place in an early stage of cell division, whereas partial bisection of the pyrenoid with an invagination of the two innermost membranes appears to start very soon after cell division  <cit> . therefore, a shallow membrane invagination is almost always observed within the pyrenoids by electron microscopy. this infers that the partial membrane constriction would be achieved by a mechanism that is independent of plastid division. our immunolocalization results indicate that the two ftszd proteins of b. natans accumulate to form a gourd-shaped ring structure associated with the membrane invagination of projecting pyrenoids . this suggests that the ftszd proteins are involved in the partial constriction of the inner pair of plastid membranes, which is supported by the finding that the expression patterns of bnftszd genes are consistent with the timing of formation of the membrane invaginations. interestingly, the membrane constriction somehow arrests on the way, and the ftszd proteins are kept in a ring-like structure along the membrane invagination. however, it remains unknown how the membrane constriction is controlled and when the plastid stroma is completely divided.

the projecting pryrenoids of chlorarachniophyte plastids have a remarkable morphological diversity in membrane invaginations among genera, which is utilized for their taxonomy. the pyrenoids of bigelowiella and norrisiella have a shallow invagination of the two innermost plastid membrane   <cit> , whereas lotharella, amorphochlora, and chlorarachnion pyrenoids possess a deep invagination that reaches the plastid stroma  <cit> . it is expected that variable degrees of z ring constriction might cause the morphological diversity of chlorarachniophyte plastids. unlike other chlorarachniophytes, gymnochlora have many single-membraned tubular invaginations in the pyrenoids  <cit> , implying that this genus might exhibit lineage-specific behavior of ftszd localization.

functional divergence of two ftsz families
although cyanobacteria possess a single gene for ftsz protein, multiple types of plastidal ftsz proteins have been reported in plants and algae; viridiplantae  have two phylogenetically distinct types of ftsz families named ftsz <dig> and ftsz <dig>  red algae have ftsza and ftszb, and secondary plastid-bearing heterokonts possess ftsza and ftszc  <cit> . two distinct plastidal ftsz families emerged by multiple duplication events of an ftsz gene originally derived from a cyanobacterium in each common ancestor of viridiplantae, red algae, and heterokonts  <cit> . green lineage ftsz <dig> and red lineage ftsza as well as cyanobacterial ftsz contain a highly conserved sequence “d/e-i/v-p-x-f/y-l” in their c-termini, the “c-terminal core domain”, whereas other ftsz <dig>  ftszb, and ftszc proteins lack this domain  <cit> . this suggests that one of two ftsz families have lost the c-terminal core domain after the duplication events. in the model plant a. thaliana, the c-terminal core domain of ftsz <dig> mediates a specific interaction with the transmembrane protein arc <dig> localized at the plastid division site to tether the z ring to the inner plastid membrane  <cit> . we revealed that chlorarachniophytes also have two distinct ftsz families, ftszd- <dig> and ftszd- <dig>  that emerged by gene duplication in a common ancestor of chlorarachniophytes . both families carry chlorarachniophyte-specific c-terminal conserved motifs, t-l-r/g-g-k-a-k-r-x-a-g-x-x-l-r-r/k-a/v-l-g within ftszd- <dig> and g-l-g-g-w-w-y-w-w-r-n within ftszd- <dig>  which are different from the c-terminal core domain of ftsz <dig> and ftsza. this suggests that chlorarachniophyte ftszd- <dig> and ftszd- <dig> independently acquired the unique c-terminal motifs after gene duplication. because of the absence of homologous gene for arc <dig> in chlorarachniophyte genomes, the c-terminal conserved motifs are not involved in the arc6-medicated membrane tethering, and the functional importance of the c-terminal conserved motifs remains uncertain.

genetic complementation experiments demonstrated that arabidopsis ftsz <dig> and ftsz <dig> were functionally non-redundant in plastid division  <cit> . their functional divergence is partly explained by the facts that only ftsz <dig> has a specific interaction with the transmembrane protein arc <dig>  <cit>  and turnover of the ftsz <dig> filaments is faster than that of ftsz <dig>  suggesting that ftsz <dig> facilitates z ring remodeling  <cit> . furthermore, it has been reported that arabidopsis ftsz <dig> and ftsz <dig> maintain a constant 1: <dig> ratio in whole mature leaves  <cit> , and that they are able to form heteropolymers at variable ratios in vitro  <cit> . in this study, we found that the two types of b. natans ftsz genes, bnftszd- <dig> and bnftszd- <dig>  showed slightly different transcription patterns in the cell cycle, and the maximum transcription level of bnftszd- <dig> was predicted to be approximately 2-fold higher than that of bnftszd- <dig>  these findings lead us to infer that the two ftsz families of chlorarachniophytes also exhibit functional divergence similar to arabidopsis ftsz families. the earlier transcription of bnftszd- <dig> than bnftszd- <dig> raise the possibility that bnftszd- <dig> plays a role in an early stage of z ring assembly and positioning.

evolution of the plastid division machinery in secondary plastids
in land plants, the z ring assembly is restricted to the plastid midpoint by several division-site positioning factors, arc <dig>  mcd <dig>  mind, and mine  <cit> . homologous genes for cyanobacteria-derived min proteins have also been found in a glaucophyte and green algae, as well as secondary plastid-bearing algae . therefore, a portion of the z ring positioning mechanism appears to be widely conserved in both primary and secondary plastids. however, the chlorarachniophyte b. natans completely lacks all genes for the plant-like z ring positioning factors, similar to the red alga c. melorae. despite the absence of canonical positioning factors, ftsz proteins are able to assemble at the plastid midpoint in both algae, suggesting that they have independently evolved a currently unknown mechanism for z ring positioning.

the division complex of primary plastids generally consists of two different gtpase proteins, ftsz and drp5b, localizing to ring-like structures on the stromal side of the inner membrane and the cytoplasm side of the outer membrane, respectively. homologous genes for ftsz and drp5b have been found in some secondary plastid-bearing algae, heterokonts and a haptophyte, and these proteins are assumed to function in the constriction of the inner pair of four plastid membranes  <cit> . however, no genes for drp5b have been identified in genomes of b. natans and the cryptophyte guillardia theta  <cit> . previous studies have reported that drp5b  mutants of a. thaliana and the moss physcomitrella patens exhibit defects in complete plastid constriction, resulting in enlarged, dumbbell-shaped plastids  <cit> . however, each cell of the drp5b mutants contains a small number of plastids, indicating that the plastids can still divide into daughter plastids without drp5b. therefore, it is possible that the two innermost membranes of secondary plastids are constricted by an ftsz-dependent but drp5b-independent mechanism in chlorarachniophytes and cryptophytes, like the plant drp5b mutants. furthermore, the absence of drp5b might be related to the partiality of membrane constriction in chlorarachniophyte plastids.

in some secondary plastids, constriction of the outer pair of plastid membranes takes place behind that of the inner pair  <cit> . although it is not known how the outer pair of membranes divide, the constriction is performed by a mechanism that is distinct from the mechanism for the inner pair. in an apicomplexan parasite, the apicomplexan-specific dynamin-related protein drpa presumably localizing on the surface of four membrane-bound apicoplasts is essential for apicoplast division  <cit> . it may be possible to infer that a lineage-specific dynamin-like protein is involved in constriction of the outer pair of plastid membranes in other secondary plastid-bearing organisms. the b. natans genome is found to encode two highly divergent dynamin-like proteins , and future studies on these proteins will provide further insights into our findings.

CONCLUSIONS
we characterized two plastid division proteins, named ftszd- <dig> and ftszd- <dig>  in chlorarachniophyte algae possessing secondary plastids. these two distinct ftsz families emerged by gene duplication in a common ancestor of chlorarachniophytes. both ftszd proteins assemble to a ring-like structure at the midpoint of bilobate plastids with a projecting pyrenoid. the ring was associated with a shallow plate-like invagination of the inner pair of plastid membranes. transcription level of b. natans ftszd genes was periodically increased soon after the cell division, which is consistent with the timing of the formation of the membrane invagination. our findings suggest that chlorarachniophyte ftszd proteins are involved in partial constriction of the inner pair of plastid membranes, but not in the whole process of plastid division. at present, it remains uncertain how the outer pair of plastid membranes is constricted in secondary plastid-bearing algae. we need further investigations to determine the whole system of secondary plastid division.
