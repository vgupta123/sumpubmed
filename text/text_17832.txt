BACKGROUND
among mammals, the cervidae family is known for its wide chromosomal diversification and this is also true for the genus mazama. this genus is considered one of the most complex  <cit> , together with the genus muntiacus <cit> . the ancestral forms of the red mazama came into south america approximately  <dig>  million years ago, and from that time branched out into various species   <cit> . following cytogenetic studies, the ancestral karyotype of the cervidae was defined as 2n =  <dig> and fn =  <dig>  <cit> .

the red brocket group accumulated multiple centric and tandem fusions leading to distinct karyotypes  <cit> , such as 2n =  <dig> to 41 + 1-6b and fn =  <dig> in m. nana <cit>  and independently, 2n = 34 + 4-5b and fn =  <dig> in m. bororo <cit> . moreover, the genus presents high intraspecific and interspecific chromosomal polymorphism  <cit> .

in the case of m. americana, current studies discuss the possibility of a cryptic species complex due to the significant intraspecific chromosomal variation  <cit> . significant differences in the patterns of karyotypic evolution in m. americana provide strong evidence that the central and south american lineages are really different species. m. temama from mexico, previously classified as m. americana temama, presented a karyotype with 2n =  <dig>  xx/xy and fn =  <dig>  <cit> .

in brazil, m. americana has a wide geographical distribution ranging from the north to the south of the country  <cit> , and specimens from different geographical locations present high levels of genetic differentiation and diversification in haplotypes and karyotypes  <cit> ; however, they are morphologically reported as a single species with no taxonomic subdivisions  <cit> .

the karyotypes of m. americana  seem to be derived from a single common ancestral karyotype with 2n = 52/53 + 3-4b, xx/xy1y <dig> and fn =  <dig>  which arose after successive tandem fusions and an x-autosome fusion  <cit> . in brazil, the species has been divided into six distinct cytotypes: rondônia , juína , jarí , carajás , santarém  and paraná   <cit> .

another recently discussed point regarding the taxonomy of the species was the discovery of two chromosome lineages: lineage a, which includes the rondônia and juína karyotypes; and lineage b, which includes the jarí, carajás, santarém, and paraná karyotypes  <cit> . both lineages evolved from a common ancestor through different chromosomal rearrangements and present a high level of genetic differentiation and distance, which led abril et al. to suggest the existence of two or more distinct species  <cit> . the chromosomal differentiation of each cytotype from the common ancestor  was achieved by the fixation of different rearrangements : i) paraná, pericentric inversion; ii) carajás, a rearrangement of the paraná cytotype with another tandem-fusion translocation; iii) santarém, a rearrangement of the paraná cytotype with another centric-fusion translocation; iv) jarí, a rearrangement of the santarém cytotype with another centric-fusion translocation; v) juína, a centric-fusion translocation and three tandem-fusion translocations; and vi) rondônia, a rearrangement of the juína cytotype with another tandem-fusion translocation  <cit> .

most of the advances in chromosomal rearrangement, speciation and their relationship, have been theoretical, especially in mammals  <cit> . in general, models of chromosome speciation have the same point of view: the reduction of gene flow through the accumulation of chromosomal differences between the progenitor and their descendants that leads to impaired fertility or viability of interspecific hybrids  <cit> . animals that are heterozygous for chromosome rearrangements may present anomalous pairings during meiosis, which results in failure during gametogenesis and unbalanced gamete production, both of which cause diminished fertility or even sterility in the organism  <cit> .

one of the most common types of structural rearrangement between species or chromosomal races is the centric fusion or robertsonian fusion  <cit> . individuals heterozygous for a single centric fusion may present diminished reproductive capacity, even though the trivalent structures formed segregate normally during meiosis  <cit> . on the other hand, a hybrid individual, descendant of progenitors that have accumulated different robertsonian fusions, can present infertility. this occurs in the mus musculus complex, due to the accumulation of centric fusions between karyotypic races, hybrids present pentavalent structures during meiosis, which leads to the formation of unbalanced gametes and the reproductive isolation of the neospecies  <cit> .

tandem fusions follow the same pattern as centric fusions, i.e. they cause diminished fertility or a reduction in the fitness of the hybrid, which can lead to reproductive isolation due to the accumulation of rearrangements  <cit> . tandem fusions appear to have a special role in the evolution of certain taxa, such as bovids  <cit> . the difference between swamp buffalo and river buffalo is a single tandem fusion, involving chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of the river buffalo karyotype  <cit> . a bull was described as exhibiting a 10% reduction in fertility due to a single tandem fusion  <cit> . in muntjac deer,  <dig> tandem fusions and three centric fusions differentiate the chinese muntjac  from the indian muntjac   <cit> .

another chromosome rearrangement that can be involved in speciation is chromosome inversion. some models suggest that the presence of inversions can lead to genetic differentiation among species, or even to reproductive isolation in populations with gene flow, by reducing recombination between inverted and non-inverted genomic regions  <cit> . in contrast, species that present a high rate of inversion polymorphism, a synaptic adjustment can occurs during meiosis leading to heterosynapsis and chiasma suppression within heterozygous inverted regions and the hybrids are fertile and viable  <cit> .

traditionally, studies involving reproductive isolation seek to prove the presence of sterility or subfertility in hybrids. in order to evaluate the fitness of the female, reproductive parameters such as meiotic parameters in germ cells of fetuses have been used  <cit> , together with histological evaluation of the ovaries  <cit>  and successful reproduction involving the production of viable fawns  <cit> . current techniques that produce viable results in a short period of time, such as in vitro testing, may also help to infer the reproductive capacity of female hybrids.

the presence of germ cells can be inferred through ovarian activity, which itself is strongly related to the regulation of steroid hormones, such as progesterone and estrogen  <cit> . a method that is commonly used to evaluate the ovaries of wild animals is the measurement of fecal progesterone metabolite levels   <cit> . in the case of neotropical deer, particularly m. gouazoubira, the characteristics of reproductive events have been studied using this method of monitoring the endocrine system  <cit> .

the genetic balance of these germ cells can be inferred using an in vitro embryo production technique. only oocytes that have a balanced genetic background are fertilizable and then capable of beginning embryogenesis  <cit> .

based on these discussions surrounding the taxonomy of the red brocket and in light of new reproductive technologies, this study sought to determine the presence or absence of post-zygotic reproductive isolation among the chromosomal lineages of the mazama americana by evaluating the fertility of pure and hybrid females.

RESULTS
hormone measurements
the hormonal profile and the base concentration of fpm were used to determine the onset of puberty , which varied from eight to 15 months of age . the females p <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> experienced their first ovulations between eight and 10 months of age, while the females p <dig>  p <dig>  and h <dig> experienced the onset of puberty later, between  <dig> and 15 months of age. two females did not show a cyclic profile similar to the others: the pure female p <dig>  in which the onset of puberty was observed; and the hybrid female h <dig>  which did not show any ovarian activity until 18 months-old.

histology of the ovaries
both the pure and hybrid females presented follicles in various stages of development, along with corpora lutea and corpora albicans; however, the hybrid females presented a smaller number of follicles than the pure females. crossings between males from lineage b  and females from lineage a  produced sterile females  that lacked follicular structures. however, crossings between males from lineage a with females from lineage b produced subfertile females  that possessed follicular structures, though fewer than pure females. despite being the result of a crossing between two cytotypes from the same lineage , specimen h <dig> presented fewer follicular structures and was more similar to the females h <dig> and h <dig> .

superovulation, follicular aspiration and in vitro production of embryos
pure females responded to superovulation treatment and provided a total of  <dig> aspirated oocytes . the total amount of oocytes obtained from pure females using the slicing method  was  <dig> .

all of the oocytes were forwarded for maturation, fertilization, culture medium and development in vitro. hoechst staining verified that  <dig> %  of the embryos experienced cleavage,  <dig> %  were considered unfertilized oocytes and  <dig> %  presented inconclusive structures. development was halted in all of the embryos before the blastocyst stage, but we were still able to obtain five morulae with more than  <dig> cells .

the female hybrids h <dig> and h <dig> did not respond to superovulation treatment and showed no follicular development , while females h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> developed follicles. fourteen oocytes were obtained by aspiration , and  <dig> oocytes  were obtained using the slicing method on half of each ovary. of these oocytes,  <dig> were forwarded for maturation, and  <dig> remained for fertilization, culture medium and development in vitro.

hoechst staining revealed an  <dig> % rate of fertilization  and a very low rate of cleavage . sixteen of the  <dig> oocytes  were considered unfertilized, and  <dig>  produced inconclusive results. development was halted in all of the embryos before the morula stage; division of only four to six cells was observed, even in the pronucleus stage.

discussion
reproductive abilities
the reproductive parameters analyzed in this study  provide conclusions concerning the reproductive abilities of pure females. the research methods used herein determined luteal phase profiles, the presence of ovarian structures, a satisfactory response to superovulation and embryos produced in vitro.

the hormone profile of fpm from the pure females indicated the presence of luteal phases, which represent ovarian activity  <cit> , as well as the absence of reproductive seasonality in these animals  <cit> . most female cervidae experience their first ovulation at approximately one year of age, while females from smaller species can expect their first ovulation sooner  <cit> . in this study, important variations occurred in the age at which the onset of puberty was experienced; in some cases this was very different from the onset at 11 months-old, as previously cited for this species  <cit> .

changes to the onset of puberty can be triggered by different factors. the rapid weight gain experienced by animals in captivity  <cit> , which increases leptin levels in the blood  <cit> , can anticipate the onset of puberty. similarly, the stress of captivity can delay puberty because of the interference of glucocorticoids in the gonadal axis  <cit> .

among the females that experienced puberty earlier , only one was pure ; the other were hybrids and they eventually cycled. in contrast, the hybrid h <dig> and the pure females p <dig> and p <dig> experienced the onset of puberty at 14 months-old.

female h <dig> lacked an ovulation cycle, results which can indicate sterility, particularly sterility associated with the lack of ovarian structures. this absence of ovarian structures was also observed in the female h <dig>  the progenitors of females h <dig> and h <dig> are carriers of complex chromosome rearrangements .

histological sections from the other female hybrids  presented germ cells , though the average number of these structures was lower compared with pure females. thus, the number of ovarian structures indicates subfertility  or sterility  in the hybrid hind studied. the ovarian activity determined in the histological evaluation is related to the response to the superovulation treatment performed on the females; for this reason, a large number of tertiary follicles were obtained, particularly from the pure females.

as expected, the rates of oocyte retrieval in vivo, even following fsh treatment, were lower in hybrid females than in pure females. these results reflect a satisfactory response to the superovulation protocol used. in wild ruminants, the rates of oocyte retrieval are similar:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  oocytes were retrieved from the species gazella dama mhorr <cit> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  were retrieved from the species cervus elaphus <cit> . for the species m. gouazoubira, an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  follicles was observed in each hind  <cit> . in the last study, the same superovulation protocol was used, though oocyte aspiration was not performed.

high rates of cleavage blocking and low rates of embryo production are both common in in vitro fertilization studies on ruminants, particularly among wild species , and these factors seem to be related to inadequate medias for development in vitro <cit> . thus, it is likely that embryonic development up to the morula stage in pure females may be due to these factors, while the blocking of embryos in hybrid females during the initial stages of development is primarily related to the chromosomal imbalance of the embryos.

if the oocyte is not fertilized, the mechanism that initiates cleavage may be activated and oocyte division occurs even in the absence of fertilization; for cleavage to continue, the genome of the embryo must be activated. in mice, it has been reported that genome activation occurs during the second round of cell division  <cit> . in bovine, activation occurs later, between the two- and eight-cell stage. in sheep and goats, activation occurs between the eight- and 16-cell stage  <cit> . there are no studies on gene activation in embryos from cervidae; therefore, the blocking of embryos from hybrid females before the morula stage  could be related to division by parthenogenetic activation or to failed embryonic genome activation. one of the factors that cause embryonic genome activation to fail is chromosome imbalance.

the high percentage of unfertilized oocytes in hybrid females could be due to a failure during the maturation stage. incompetent oocytes are deficient in the amount of mrna necessary to promote nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation. this deficiency impedes the penetration of spermatozoa and, consequently, embryonic development  <cit> . a study of the synaptonemal complex in fetuses from female hybrids of different species of wallabies determined irregularities in chromosome pairing during the first phase of meiosis. during this phase, unpaired regions and multiple bonds  were identified, among other irregularities  <cit> . this abnormal meiotic division of the oocyte leads to the production of genetically imbalanced gametes that are unable to continue meiosis or produce the amount of mrnas necessary for their maturation and the development of reproductive abilities; for this reason, embryonic production in hybrids fails.

post-zygotic reproductive isolation
the data obtained in this study makes it possible to draw certain conclusions regarding the reproductive abilities of pure females and the presence of subfertility and sterility in hybrids. specimens that were the product of crossings between females from lineage b  and males from lineage a  presented subfertility, while those that were produced from ♀a x ♂b crossings were almost completely sterile. the females h <dig> and h <dig>  were sterile, and were the product of progenitors that carried five chromosomal rearrangements: one pericentric inversion, one centric-fusion translocation, and three tandem-fusion translocations. the female h <dig>  was subfertile, even though the differences between her progenitors involved the same chromosomal rearrangements as the females h <dig> and h <dig> 

the other two females that were subfertile were h <dig>  and h <dig> . the female h <dig> presented the greatest chromosomal difference among the parental cytotypes: one pericentric inversion, one centric fusion and four tandem fusions. the parental cytotypes of female h <dig> differ by only one tandem fusion. even though they are carriers of a heterozygous centric fusion involving the same chromosome pairs, female h <dig> did not inherit this centric fusion from its progenitors. thus, its subfertility, detected by reproductive parameters, is related to the difference that the tandem fusion generates between the ju and ro cytotypes. this type of rearrangement seems to have an important role in the origin of fertility problems and in the reproductive isolation of several species  <cit> .

the accumulation of chromosomal rearrangements leads to infertility due to the death of germ cells, which in turn is due to failures during meiotic pairing  <cit> . this conclusion seems to be the most likely explanation for the reproductive impairment observed in the female hybrids. in hybrids, the chromosomal rearrangements  are heterozygous and could be the cause of the chromosome imbalance that led to subfertility and sterility  <cit> . the accumulation of chromosomal rearrangements that are involved in the differentiation between lineages a and b of m. americana may be the cause of the reproductive isolation identified in our experiment.

because the cytotypes were geographically isolated  <cit> , chromosomal differentiation between the populations seems to have occurred allopatrically  <cit> . chromosome fragility and a high rate of chromosomal rearrangements are probably involved in the karyotype evolution of cervidae and both of these would explain the system of mazama americana cytotypes  <cit> . according to duarte et al.  <cit> , the divergence of the most distant lineages of m. americana most likely occurred  <dig>  million years ago; a relatively short amount of time for two such karyotypically different species to develop. two species that diverged from this branch were m. bororo and m. nana, with 2n of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . thus, chromosomal rearrangements seem to be the most important and efficient mechanism of speciation in this group to achieve the generation of reproductive isolation after such a short period of time.

villena and sapienza  <cit>  argued that karyotype evolution in mammals has occurred mainly through the non-random segregation of chromosomes during meiosis in the oocyte. they affirmed that factors that regulate female meiosis play a role in the fixation of certain chromosomal rearrangements. in the case of the genus mazama, the main rearrangements were those that reduced the diploid number in populations, such as centric-fusion and tandem-fusion translocations, which are both present in large quantities during the differentiation between the cytotypes of m. americana <cit> .

in  <dig>  duarte et al.  <cit>  evaluated the genetic distance between the m. americana cytotypes. they suggested that the separation of the cytotypes may have occurred at the end of the pliocene, after the great migration of the ancestral forms of these species, which came from north america. after the isolation of the populations, both genetic and cytogenetic diversification occurred. based on cytogenetic analyses, abril et al.  <cit>  suggested the differentiation of two clades of the species m. americana, which is supported by molecular analyses of mitochondrial dna. these analyses revealed that the rondônia and juína cytotypes compose the a clade, with a smaller chromosomal number, and that the paraná, carajás, jarí and santarém cytotypes compose the b clade, with a larger diploid number. despite chromosomal and genetic differences, the populations maintained the same phenotype, and can therefore be considered as cryptic species  <cit> .

all of the crossings performed between lineages a and b resulted in reproductive isolation, supporting the separation of these two lineages into at least two species. since few crossings of deer with distinct karyotypes were obtained from the same chromosomal lineage , it is difficult to prove the existence of reproductive isolation within chromosome lineages, despite the fact that the hind produced was subfertile.

the high degree of chromosomal divergence in m. americana causes an important taxonomic problem. rossi’s morphological studies  <cit>  did not identify any significant differences between populations of m. americana. thus, though there are relevant and consistent chromosomal and molecular differences among the populations  <cit> , including the well-established case of reproductive isolation, these differences are not reflected in morphological differences. this inconsistency makes it difficult to identify species without using genetic methods.

despite the existence of well-defined cytotypes that have been proven to be reproductively isolated, questions remain regarding the taxonomic level of the closest cytotypes, such as paraná and carajás, or even juína and rondônia. these uncertainties cause problems that are reflected in conservation and raise the question whether each cytotype should be considered independent from a taxonomic perspective. a larger sample must be collected, and more studies, particularly concerning the existence of reproductive isolation among closely related cytotypes must be performed so that the correct management and conservation decisions can be made. one of the cytotypes, that which is found in the atlantic forest region of south america, could be considered the most threatened of the cervid species in the americas if it is considered to be from a different taxon than the remaining red brocket deer.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we verified that two of the six chromosome variants that exist within m. americana  possess an efficient mechanism of post-zygotic reproductive isolation, which involves infertility or subfertility of the hybrid. once the true impossibility of gene flow between the lineages is identified, more concrete discussions on modifications to the taxonomy of this species can be initiated. in light of the results of this study, combined with previous studies, both lineages may be considered as cryptic species that present the same phenotype. populations with similar karyotypes must be evaluated more carefully, since there is a reasonable likelihood that they are also distinct species. chromosomal changes have proven to be an efficient and powerful mechanism in the isolation of populations and in the formation of species in the genus mazama.
