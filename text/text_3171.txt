BACKGROUND
water-soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase  from acinetobacter calcoaceticus has great potential for application as a constituent of an electron mediator-type glucose sensor. the conventionally utilized enzyme for glucose measurement, glucose oxidase , inherently utilizes oxygen as its electron acceptor during the oxidation of glucose. in contrast, pqqgdh-b is completely independent of oxygen, resulting in improved accuracy and rapidity during glucose measurement. however, because the substrate specificity and stability of pqqgdh-b remain somewhat inferior to those of god, we have been engaged in the improvement of these enzymatic properties through protein engineering to further increase the application of pqqgdh-b in glucose monitoring systems  <cit> .

the subunit structure of pqqgdh-b was determined to be homodimeric with no activity observed in its monomeric form  <cit> . correct quaternary structure is essential for the formation of active enzyme and dissociation of the dimer conformation triggers inactivation of the enzyme. we have previously reported on the increasing of the stability of pqqgdh-b against the dissociation of quaternary structure by chemical cross-linking  <cit> , by constructing tethered enzyme  <cit> , and by introducing cys residues at the dimer interface to form a novel intersubunit disulfide bond  <cit> . all of these attempts were based on decreasing the entropy by decreasing the possibility of dimer dissociation, but no attempts had been made to increase the interaction between the two subunits.

in this paper, we report on our rational designing of hydrophobic interaction in the dimer interface to increase the stability of pqqgdh-b. we identified protein regions at the dimer interface where potential novel hydrophobic interactions could be introduced by amino acid substitution, thereby increasing the stability.

RESULTS
modeling novel dimer hydrophobic core
among  <dig> amino acid residues located at the dimer interface,  <dig> residues were predicted not to be involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, or hydrophobic interactions . we focused on the residues asn <dig>  tyr <dig>  thr <dig>  and thr <dig>  as they are not involved in the formation of the active site cavity and are therefore suitable candidates for amino acid substitution. although residues asn <dig> and tyr <dig> face each other on the surface of the dimer interface , no interaction exists between their side chains. we therefore simultaneously substituted asn <dig> to phe and tyr <dig> to phe or ile to create the mutants asn340phe/tyr418phe and asn340phe/tyr418ile, respectively. furthermore, the hydrophobic region composed of residues leu <dig>  val <dig>  and val <dig> faces residues thr <dig> and thr <dig>  again with no specific interaction. we therefore substituted thr <dig> to val and thr <dig> to val to create the double mutant thr416val/thr417val.

characterization of mutant enzymes
the activity and stability of each of the three constructed double mutant enzymes were then analyzed. all three mutant enzymes showed slightly higher thermal stability than wild-type pqqgdh-b upon incubation for  <dig> min at various temperatures . the temperatures resulting in lose of half of the initial activity were shifted by approximately 3°c higher in the mutants compared to the wild type . as the time course of thermal inactivation at 55°c follows first-order kinetics , half-lives were calculated using logarithmic regression of residual activity. the wild-type enzyme inactivates at 55°c with a half-life of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min, while all three double mutants showed greater thermal stability, with half-lives of 5–6°c greater .

a th represents the temperature at which half the initial activity is lost in  <dig> min.

b t1/ <dig> represents the half-life at 55°c.

investigation of the kinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant enzymes shows that the mutations did not significantly affect the overall kinetic properties of pqqgdh-b . the specific activities of asn340phe/tyr418phe , asn340phe/tyr418ile , and thr416val/thr417val  were close to that of the wild-type enzyme . except for thr416val/thr417val, which had a km value of  <dig> mm, the mutants had km values identical to  <dig> mm km value of the wild-type enzyme.

discussion
pqqgdh-b is a 6-blade β-propeller protein, with each blade consisting of a 4-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet   <cit> . the strands in each w-motif are labeled a-d from the inside to the outside of the molecule  <cit> . all strands are connected by loops, which are named according to the strands they connect. based on pqqgdh-b structural information, these loop regions have been associated with a number of important functions, such as substrate binding, co-factor binding, and formation of the enzyme active site. as with other β-propeller proteins, the catalytic site and substrate-binding pocket of pqqgdh-b is made up of the cleft formed by loops da and bc  <cit> . the enzyme surface composed of loops ab and cd is therefore located opposite the functional region. in the present study, we have introduced mutations at asn <dig>  tyr <dig>  thr <dig>  and thr <dig>  which are all located in the loop 5cd region. considering that these residues are located far from the functional region and do not contribute in the structure of functional region, it is not surprising that their substitutions did not significantly alter the enzyme's kinetic parameters, particularly its catalytic activity.

based on the predicted structure of the mutant enzymes shown in figure  <dig>  the binding energy of each subunit was calculated, using both the amber <dig> and charmm <dig> force fields, and compared with those of the wild-type enzyme . as expected, the increases in hydrophobicity at the subunit interface resulted in increases in their binding energies calculated by both methods. estimation of the number of hydrophobic interactions based on these same predicted models revealed  <dig> to  <dig> novel hydrophobic interactions at the interface of all the mutants, while none were found in the wild-type one. these results based on structural predictions are consistent with the observed improvements in thermal stability.

the addition of hydrophobic interactions in other enzymes has been reported to result in thermostability increases of  <dig> to 10°c  <cit> , comparable to the results of the current study. recent observations of enzymes from thermophilic organisms indicate that their extraordinary thermal stability is due to hydrophobic interactions. oligomeric enzyme stability was also reported to be improved through engineering to increase the hydrophobic interaction at the oligomer interface  <cit> . however, these studies were based on homology analyses between mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria together with random mutagenesis library analyses  <cit> . although some sequences have been found to be homologous to pqqgdh-b, these are all putative orfs with no functional information reported. therefore, there exists no reliable template to help improve the stability of this enzyme by increasing the dimer interface interaction.

CONCLUSIONS
we improved pqqgdh-b's thermal stability by increasing the dimer interface interaction through rational design based on its quaternary structure. we demonstrated that this can be achieved by selecting residues located at the dimer interface that do not contribute to the intersubunit interaction and substituting them to hydrophobic ones via site-directed mutagenesis. in each case tested, the enzyme's thermal stability was increased without decreasing its catalytic activity. this rational design approach will provide relevant information for future designs by combining with other mutant pqqgdh-bs with narrowed substrate specificity and improved catalytic efficiency.
