BACKGROUND
identifying positive genomic selection in domestic animals is a major challenge in contemporary agricultural research. to date only a small number of examples have successfully identified genomic regions subject to positive selection in domestic animals  <cit> . increasing the understanding of positive selection and how it shapes genetic variation in domestic animals has the potential to provide powerful insights into the mechanisms involved in evolution, help target loci for selection and possibly highlight the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity for complex traits  <cit> . domestic animals provide a unique opportunity to detect positive selection due to their extensive diversity amongst breeds, increasing availability of sequence data and large databases of polymorphisms that are accruing in domestic species like bos taurus.

data on polymorphisms can provide evidence of selection if the patterns in the data are incompatible with a neutral model  <cit> . for instance, the neutral model with constant effective population size predicts that most polymorphisms will have one common allele and one rare allele. more specifically, if p is the frequency of one of the two alleles chosen at random and f is the distribution or spectrum of all polymorphisms where one allele has frequency p, then f = k/) where k is a constant. tajima's d statistic  <cit>  measures the extent to which real data differs from this theoretical expectation. tajima  <cit>  suggests that changes in the frequency spectrum of neutral polymorphic alleles can be used to detect a hitchhiking effect due to the spread of linked advantageous mutations. therefore, high values of d indicate that common polymorphisms are more frequent than expected from the neutral theory and this is a result of genetic hitchhiking. however, polymorphisms are discovered by methods that tend to find common variants and this ascertainment bias can also generate an excess of polymorphisms with intermediate allele frequency.

the test for departure from expectation can be made more powerful if it is possible to distinguish the ancestral allele from the derived or mutant allele at each locus. if p is the frequency of the derived allele, then the distribution of all derived alleles is f = k/p. fay and wu measure departure from this expectation with their h statistic  <cit> . if derived alleles are found at high frequency more often than expected, then h will be positive. they suggest that selection causes a positive h statistic, because selection sometimes drives the derived allele to high frequency. this can occur if the polymorphisms observed are subject to selection themselves, but can also occur at neutral loci as a result of hitchhiking caused by selection acting on linked loci. this makes h a very useful test for selection because most polymorphisms are discovered randomly and few of them are likely to be directly subject to selection.

unfortunately, both d and h can depart from expectation for reasons other than selection  <cit> . the way in which polymorphisms are discovered usually means that low frequency polymorphisms are less likely to be discovered than one with alleles at intermediate frequency. d and h are also affected by changing effective population size . if ne declines, polymorphisms with one rare allele become less frequent and the frequency spectrum becomes flatter. in this way a decline in ne  can mimic selection  <cit> . therefore, detecting unambiguous examples of positive selection has been difficult due the difficulty of many methods to differentiate between positive selection and demographic history. this is of particular concern in domestic species where snp discovery typically involves some ascertainment bias and demographic fluctuations coupled with strong directional  selection, which have played important roles in the formation of domestic breeds  <cit> .

the problem of ascertainment bias will result in an observed allele frequency spectrum that is more flat than that predicted by theory. however, it is possible to construct a test that is not affected by this ascertainment bias if derived and ancestral alleles can be distinguished. since f = k/p for derived alleles with frequency p  <cit> , the frequency spectrum for all ancestral alleles with frequency 1-p is f. the spectrum for all alleles with derived or ancestral allele frequencies p or 1-p is then f + f, which is equal to f), see above. so neutrality predicts that the proportion of these alleles where the ancestral allele is p is f/, which is equal to p. assuming that the polymorphism discovery method cannot distinguish ancestral and derived alleles, this expectation for different p intervals is not affected by the ascertainment bias. it has only been tested for p from  <dig> to  <dig> , since the value of any f/ is 1-. also, because selection does not typically affect all parts of the genome equally, selection and demographic phenomena can be compared. for instance, a selected allele can drag derived alleles that are closely linked to high frequencies by hitchhiking. therefore, selection should cause an autocorrelation of high frequency derived alleles between one locus and the next on the chromosome. to test if the observed autocorrelation could be due to inbreeding, we have used a simulation study to demonstrate the effect of inbreeding in the absence of selection and compared the results with those found in real data.

recently it has become possible to assay large numbers of polymorphisms in cattle and this offers a new source of data with which to detect evidence of selection. in this paper we use data from two breeds of cattle  each genotyped for over  <dig>  snps using the parallele/affymetrix platform. by also genotyping these snps on  <dig> species related to bos taurus  we have been able to distinguish the derived and ancestral allele at each locus and use this information to test for deviations from neutrality.

the comparison between the allele frequencies in the angus and holstein breeds might also contain evidence of selection since they have been selected for different traits. however, their allele frequencies also differ due to genetic drift caused by finite population size or inbreeding. the difference in allele frequencies can be quantified by the statistic fst. inbreeding should affect all loci equally and genetic drift should affect loci randomly and not show any linkage disequilibrium between adjacent loci, but we hypothesise that selection will drive linked derived alleles to high frequency in one breed but not the other. therefore selection should cause higher values of fst among loci where the derived allele is common than when the ancestral allele is common. we examine how fst between angus and holstein changes with allele frequency and compare the result to that obtained with the simulated data.

RESULTS
amplification of b. taurus designed markers in wild relatives
approximately  <dig> holstein,  <dig> angus and one of the outgroup species each  were genotyped for over  <dig>  snp. in total  <dig>  amplified in both breeds of b. taurus and at least one of the outgroup species. of these  <dig>  and  <dig>  snp were found to be segregating in angus and holstein, respectively. the remaining assays were fixed for the derived or ancestral alleles .

fay and wu's h test
in table  <dig> a summary of fay and wu's h statistic is presented for a survey of  <dig>   <dig> snp in holstein and angus cattle. in both angus and holstein populations h values are considerably larger than  <dig> . a comparison of h values between holstein and angus identified a significantly larger value for h in angus cattle . this indicates that derived alleles occur at a higher frequency than expected under the neutral model, especially in angus.

*s.e. is the standard error of h and p is the probability that θh and θπ are equal

frequency spectrum of derived and ancient alleles
the frequency spectrum of derived variants f alongside the expected frequency spectrum e under neutrality, which is calculated as k/p where k = the value calculated from the sum of all f so the theoretical and actual curves match as close as possible for holstein and angus cattle, is presented in figure 1a, b. in general both breeds show a flat distribution for the spectrum of derived alleles. both holstein and angus show a deficiency of derived alleles at low frequency, especially in holstein. however, at high frequencies there may be an increase in the abundance of derived alleles, especially in angus cattle.

to avoid ascertainment bias, we have plotted f/ against its expectation under the neutral model in figures 2a and 2b. under a neutral model with constant ne, the expectation of this statistic is simply p. the figures show that the derived alleles are more common than expected. for instance, in figure 2a when the minor allele frequency is  <dig> , we expect that in  <dig>  of the loci the common allele is the derived allele, but we observe this in  <dig>  of the loci. in holstein and especially angus, derived alleles are more common than expected.

genomic distribution of high frequency derived polymorphisms
the frequency spectrum of derived alleles appears to follow a pattern contrary to that expected under neutrality, as there are too many derived mutations with relatively high frequency. if these mutations are clustered in certain areas of the genome, this may be evidence of positive selection driving these alleles to high frequencies. alternatively if they are distributed randomly throughout the genome, this may be a result of inbreeding randomly increasing the frequency of some derived  mutations.

the distribution across the genome of high frequency derived alleles in angus and holstein was compared to that in two simulated populations devoid of positive selection to determine if the pattern observed in angus and holstein could be due to changing ne or whether it is indicative of selection. table  <dig> summarises the results of an analysis using autocorrelation between adjacent and derived polymorphisms per chromosome for both b. taurus and simulated populations. positive correlations were detected in the b. taurus breeds, while the autocorrelation in the simulated data did not differ significantly from zero. a t-test indicated that on average the positive correlations found in holstein and angus were significantly larger than zero, while those in the simulated populations were not . thus, high frequency derived alleles seem to be clustered in the genome, especially in holstein.

*x chromosome not modelled in simulated populations

in order to visually summarise the data presented in table  <dig> we plotted the derived allele frequency against genomic position over the entire genome, we also contrasted this with fst at the same positions. due to the volume of information, these plots have been included as supplementary figures 1– <dig> a and b for all holstein and angus chromosomes . in general if we just examine the derived allele frequency some grouping of derived alleles at high frequencies can be found throughout the genome. the largest autocorrelations were found on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in holstein and angus . this could be due to positive selection independently increasing the frequency of derived polymorphisms in both breeds, or more likely it could be due to selection acting in the common ancestor of holstein and angus. for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> high autocorrelations in one breed and not the other where identified, which may be evidence of breed specific selection . also, lack of any significant correlation in the simulated populations in table  <dig> suggests that inbreeding cannot solely create this clustering of high frequency derived alleles.

phylogenetic analysis and the frequency of derived alleles in holstein and angus
we used a neutral phylogenetic tree to overlay the average frequency of derived alleles between angus and holstein cattle . at the  <dig>  polymorphic sites analysed, the holstein breed had a higher average derived allele frequency  when compared to angus , which is similar to the finding we observed in table  <dig>  however, the difference between breeds was not significant.

average fst and derived allele distributions
fst between holstein and angus was  <dig>  and between the two simulated populations was  <dig> . in figure  <dig> fst is calculated for specific ranges of derived allele frequencies . for both the simulated and real populations, fst is highest when the average allele frequency is  <dig>  or  <dig> , which is a feature of the formula for fst. we hypothesised that selection would create higher fst values when the derived allele was frequent than when it was rare, but there is no evidence for such a trend when the real populations are compared to the simulated populations. in general higher fst detected between simulated populations than between b. taurus breeds probably reflects the simulation and an over estimate of the effect of inbreeding in the theoretical populations. however, the differences between the frequency spectrums are small.

the distribution of derived allele frequencies and fst are quite different analyses of the polymorphism data. given that a number of chromosomes in table  <dig> have shown different degrees of clustering for high frequency derived alleles. we plotted the genomic distribution of fst and the derived allele frequency  per chromosome to see if any genomic regions were outliers for both . overall the majority of chromosomes in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> show genomic regions where there are outliers for high fst and derived allele frequency. in particular, one region on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  stands out in angus between base pairs  <dig> ,000– <dig> , <dig>   <dig> ,000– <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> ,000– <dig> , <dig>  respectively. at these regions of the genome show derived alleles in angus that have been driven to a frequency of  <dig> – <dig> , while in holstein they range from  <dig> – <dig> . this difference in derived allele frequencies has been responsible for an inflated fst value , when compared to the average between breeds . an examination of these regions identifies no particular candidates of positive selection, except for some unknown genes and fgf <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  however all of these chromosomal regions show evidence of qtl affecting body composition  and carcass yield   <cit> . qtl resolution remains coarse for these regions, as the cattle genome becomes more completely annotated these regions may identify useful targets of selection.

frequency spectrum of ancient polymorphisms in b. taurus
in total the  <dig>  snp markers in angus that successfully genotyped in at least one of the wild species were examined for evidence of ancestral polymorphisms. of these, we identified  <dig>  that appear to be ancestral in origin, in that the three groups were not fixed for a single allele .

in figures 5a and 5b the frequency spectrum of ancestral polymorphisms along with the expected distribution in holstein and angus are presented, respectively. the derived and ancestral alleles could not be determined for these polymorphisms, because the snps are segregating in the wild relatives. therefore an allele was chosen at random and its allele frequency was used in figure  <dig>  in both breeds the frequency spectrum of ancestral polymorphisms is generally flat. however, there is an excess of rare  and most common  classes of alleles, some of which may be typing errors.

ancestral polymorphism and effective population size
the  <dig> ancestral polymorphisms found in b. taurus suggest that despite any recent bottlenecks in b. taurus that occurred during the domestication process, very large populations must have been maintained in the ancestral auroch  population prior to its domestication some  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . thus, 931/ <dig>  =  <dig>  of snp in b. taurus have remained polymorphic for over ~ <dig> million years.

hence, if the fixation of neutral alleles is typically governed by chance, the probability of fixation per generation after equilibrium is reached is

   

and the probability of no fixation over t generations is

   

for the purpose of estimating the effective population size of the ancestral species it was assumed that the number of polymorphisms was similar between ancestral and contemporary populations. the divergence times estimated by maceachern et al  <cit>  were used to calculate the average divergence time for bison, yak and banteng, which was approximately  <dig>  mya. if the average generation time for these animals is  <dig> years, t should be roughly  <dig>  ×  <dig> generations. thus, for equation  <dig>  setting e-t/2ne =  <dig> , gives an effective population size of ~ <dig>  animals, and of course the actual number of animals would have been some degree larger than this. it is important to note that this estimate is affected by our estimate of generation time, which may have been greater than  <dig> years. however, the rate of fixation in domestic cattle most likely increased with decreasing population size and therefore our estimate should be a good approximation.

ancestral alleles and phylogenetic relationships in closely related bovids
from the  <dig>  snps assayed in at least one wild relative,  <dig> loci could not have an ancestral allele determined as both alleles were found to be present in at least one of the three closely related species. from these  <dig> snps the number of cases where both b. taurus alleles are detected in one of the three related species is summarised in table  <dig>  maceachern et al.  <cit>  concluded that the yak appeared to share more alleles with b. taurus than bison, although this difference was not significant using a t-test . in the present study banteng was found to show roughly double the number of mutations in common with b. taurus than bison or yak and was significantly more similar to b. taurus than the other two species . however, our banteng samples were sourced from the taronga western plains zoo in australia and there was no guarantee that this animal had no b. taurus ancestors. the possibility that the banteng has been crossbred may potentially affect the estimates of ne, as some of the  <dig> alleles originally thought to be ancestral polymorphisms could be the result of recent introgression. however, this should only affect a small percentage of the  <dig> snps and therefore not have a large impact on the estimate of ne. although without 100% surety of the genetic purity of our wild relatives some caution may be needed for the interpretation of our findings

 <dig> = homozygote allele a,  <dig> = homozygote allele b,  <dig> = a/b heterozygote

heterozygosity
as only one animal was sampled for each wild species their heterozygosity was estimated as the proportion of heterozygotes from the total number of snps that successfully amplified in each animal. table  <dig> summarises the number of heterozygotes detected from the number of successful assays and the average heterozygosity for each sample. the highest heterozygosity was found in banteng and the lowest was found in bison.

discussion
genotyping and wild specimens
we have found that a high proportion  of snp markers, designed from the b. taurus genome, were successfully assayed in a number of wild relatives from the bovina subtribe, which diverged from b. taurus between 1– <dig> mya, while no successful genotypes were recorded from the bubalina subtribe, which diverged some <  <dig> mya. it is unclear whether the lack of amplification in the bubalina was the result of low selective constraint over snp, or if there was a problem with dna. however, a recent study by gautier et al.  <cit>  identified a high rate of successful snp assays in goat , which diverged at least  <dig> mya from cattle. thus members of the bovina subtribe should be suitable outgroups for snp genotyping studies in b. taurus.

genome wide polymorphism scans reveal a deviation from neutrality in two breeds of b. taurus
researchers utilising the bovine genome have uncovered large number of snps, which has presented researchers the opportunity to examine patterns of dna sequence variation for indirect evidence of positive selection by cataloguing levels of genetic hitchhiking. to this end, we analysed over  <dig>  snp spaced throughout the genome of holstein and angus cattle . we identified significantly large deviations from neutrality in each b. taurus population using the h statistic developed by fay and wu  <cit> , which may result from either recent positive selection, ascertainment bias or inbreeding.

scans examining the frequency distribution of polymorphisms for deviations from neutral expectations often run into difficulty when trying to differentiate between the effects of positive selection and demographics. this is because the null hypotheses used to test for significance unrealistically assumes that the demographic history of the sample population was a random mating population with an unchanged ne  <cit> . ascertainment bias for common alleles can also affect scans for positive selection from polymorphism data, which may mimic the results expected for positive selection or those produced from demographic processes such as inbreeding. the ~ <dig>  snps that were provided as part of the genotyping platform by parallele bio sciences were discovered using the cattle genome project, based on sequences from only one or a few animals . the small numbers of animals sampled during snp discovery would suggest that there is some ascertainment bias. hence, inferences of positive selection from tests that come directly from allele frequency distributions should be made with caution.

by examining several thousand loci it was possible to distinguish between the effects of population structure, positive selection and ascertainment bias on the frequency spectrum of ancestral and derived alleles. as indicated by the significant h test, the results detected an excess of high frequency derived alleles in holstein and angus populations. the frequency spectrums in figure  <dig> are generally too flat when compared to the distributions expected under neutrality. the frequency distribution highlights a number of discrepancies at medium frequencies  for angus and holstein, which would be expected if there was ascertainment bias towards common polymorphisms. however, a flat distribution was also found in figure  <dig> and this plot removes any effects from ascertainment bias on the frequency distribution as the plot examines the frequency of the derived allele compared to the ancestral allele, using the ratio f/ and information regarding the derived and ancestral alleles are irrelevant during the snp discovery. hence, the flat distribution witnessed in figure  <dig> indicates that derived alleles occur at high frequency more often than expected and that this was not due to any ascertainment bias. this new metric may be of use to researchers trying to identify selective sweeps to datasets that are influenced by ascertainment bias.

reduced ne or inbreeding could, however, cause the distribution observed in figure  <dig> because it leads to a random dispersal of allele frequencies. we used a transition matrix method to calculate the amount of inbreeding necessary to generate an allele frequency spectrum that matched that observed. this was done by starting with the allele frequency spectrum expected under the neutral model  = k/p) and using a transition matrix which calculated the spectrum one generation later assuming a population of effective size ne and no mutation. the matrix multiplication was repeated multiple times until the spectrum matches the observed spectrum. we found that to replicate a frequency distribution similar to that displayed in figure  <dig> would require enough generations to reach an inbreeding coefficient of  <dig> .

an example of the effect of genetic drift is shown by the frequency spectrum of ancient polymorphisms presented in figure  <dig>  which shows a very flat distribution. this is expected for very old polymorphisms. it is unlikely that these polymorphisms have all been maintained due to overdominance and so we assume that they have been maintained in the historically large populations that once existed in bovids. slight peaks are witnessed at the extremes of the distribution <  <dig>  and >  <dig> . because all fixed alleles with frequencies of  <dig> and  <dig>  were removed from the analysis, these may represent typing errors or be evidence of alleles that have been positively selected towards fixation.

genomic distribution of high frequency derived alleles
the large number of high frequency derived alleles found in angus and holstein populations are unexpected under neutrality with constant ne  <cit> . to distinguish between the effects of positive selection and inbreeding on the frequency spectrum of derived mutants in b. taurus we examined the tendency of derived alleles to cluster together in the genomes of angus and holstein populations using the autocorrelation between frequencies of derived alleles. a positive autocorrelation for derived allele frequencies between neighbouring loci indicated that there is an association between high frequency derived alleles in the genomes of both cattle breeds. this is consistent with positive selection and not changes in population size or ascertainment bias. a simulated population that had been inbred to similar levels as contemporary populations, without the influence of positive selection, failed to show a similar autocorrelation between high frequency derived alleles. therefore, this suggests that hitchhiking events are common throughout the genomes of both breeds of b. taurus and this is consistent with positive selection for some loci. if this is the case, it appears to have influenced the holstein genome more than the angus genome. there is a possibility that our findings are the result of sampling error. however, as this study is based on a fairly large sample size in both breeds  we believe the findings are indicative of stronger artificial selection in the holstein breed.

fst distribution and inbreeding and selection in b. taurus
if different selection pressures operated in holstein and angus, then different derived alleles might be driven to high frequency in the two breeds. this would cause fst between the breeds to be higher when the frequency of the derived allele was high. we estimated fst per locus and plotted their average values against the average derived allele frequency in b. taurus and in the simulated populations . initial examinations of the frequency distribution of fst between b. taurus breeds do not appear to find any overwhelming signatures of positive selection as the distribution of fst is fairly symmetrical with respect to allele frequency. nor has examining fst plots for the simulated and observed populations identified any convincing differences. however, plots of derived allele frequency overlayed with fst identified regions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in angus where large regions have had the derived alleles driven to near fixation generating higher fst values for these regions than the overall average . a quick examination of the genes underlying these regions has not identified any remarkable candidates for positive selection, perhaps except for fgf <dig> in beef cattle, but these regions are associated with qtl identified for body composition and carcass yield  <cit> . hence, our results may be of future interest for identifying signatures of recent positive artificial selection between the two breeds or as additional evidence for any polymorphisms that show associations with beef or milk traits.

ancestral polymorphisms
a recurring theme that appears when examining polymorphisms in b. taurus is the high proportion of polymorphisms that appear to be segregating in wild species. in the phylogenetic analysis presented by maceachern et al.  <cit>  a surprisingly large proportion  of nucleotide substitutions between species did not follow a simple tree implying that these sites were polymorphic in an ancestral species that had subsequently undergone lineage sorting in the extant bovids. these ancestral polymorphisms were found from sequencing a number of b. taurus breeds and a subset of wild relatives from the bovinae subfamily without any knowledge about whether they were still segregating in b. taurus. in contrast, work completed in the current study focuses on nucleotides that have been identified to be segregating in b. taurus. however, we have also found a large proportion of b. taurus polymorphisms  to be segregating in the wild relatives. despite the difference in the method by which they were detected, the possible explanations for them are similar. that is, they must have arisen due to a double mutation, introgressive hybridisation or alternatively they are due to the presence of ancestral polymorphisms that are still segregating in b. taurus. these loci may in fact still be segregating in the wild relatives, even if they are not heterozygous in the wild species sampled. alternatively, they have undergone lineage sorting and hence they appear to be alleles with 'abnormal' inheritance, as described in maceachern et al.  <cit> . therefore, approximately 10% of all polymorphisms in the bovinae are likely due to ancestral polymorphisms in the common ancestor of cattle and bison/yak/banteng.

maceachern et al.  <cit>  have suggested that the majority of ancestral polymorphisms are neutral and thus their frequency is governed by random genetic drift, suggesting they have persisted in the extant members of the bovinae due to chance. in the current paper the frequency spectrum of ancient polymorphisms presented in figure  <dig> is largely flat for both populations of b. taurus, especially if the extremes of the distribution are ignored because they are most likely to represent typing errors. thus the flat distributions in figure  <dig> suggest that the ancient polymorphisms are largely neutral. hence, these sites should be useful for determining the effective population size in ancestral species, which we estimated to be approximately  <dig> . this estimate of ne can be quickly compared with the heterozygosity expected in contemporary populations of b. taurus as the heterozygosity expected is

   

where μ = the mutation rate per generation. if the mammalian mutation rate is  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per base per year as estimated by  <cit>  this implies  <dig>  × 10- <dig> mutations per base per generation if the generation length is  <dig> years. then equation  <dig> gives he =  <dig> . maceachern et al  <cit>  sequenced eight holstein animals and the polymorphism rate in noncoding dna was estimated as  <dig> . we have used a modification to equation  <dig> in fay and wu  <cit>  to convert this to an estimate of heterozygosity within holstein to compare this result with the estimated heterozygosity from equation  <dig>  hence, holstein heterozygosity was estimated as

   

where di is the polymorphism rate at noncoding sites estimated from maceachern et al.  <cit>  and n = the number of chromosomes sampled. this yields an estimate of heterozygosity in holsteins equal to  <dig> , which is approximately  <dig> times less than what we expected from ne =  <dig>  . this difference could largely be the result of the amount of inbreeding that has occurred in contemporary populations of b. taurus or by error in the estimate of μ.

wild species heterozygosity and overall similarity to b. taurus
a number of the ancestral polymorphisms were examined for the proportion of loci that were heterozygous in the outgroup species and for their similarity to b. taurus. maceachern et al.  <cit>  identified a large number of genetic similarities between yak and b. taurus. we have found that yak shares slightly more alleles with b. taurus than does bison, but the difference was not significant. thus, there is only weak evidence that yak is more closely related to b. taurus than is bison. we have also found that banteng shared a larger number of alleles with b. taurus than yak or bison, which is most likely a result of having a banteng animal with questionable ancestry, which may result in a slight over estimation of the number of ancestral polymorphisms and hence of ne. if the banteng sample contained bos taurus genes, it would inflate the number of cases where banteng was heterozygous for the yak/bison allele and the b. taurus allele. table  <dig> shows that this occurred in only  <dig> cases out of  <dig> snps. therefore, even if this hybridisation had occurred, it would not affect the conclusions greatly.

examining the proportion of heterozygous loci in table  <dig>  yak appears to be more heterozygous than bison, which may reflect past population bottlenecks in bison  <cit> . not surprisingly, banteng was the most heterozygous of all animals, and this might be expected if the banteng has a questionable background. although we believe the yak and bison samples used are genetically pure, without 100% certainty about the ancestry of our samples, some caution may be needed with our interpretations that rely on this aspect.

CONCLUSIONS
we have examined the frequency distribution of polymorphisms in milking and beef breeds of b. taurus using fay and wu's h as a test to identify genomic positive selection. significant deviations from neutral expectations were identified, which appears to be a combined effect of positive selection, inbreeding and ascertainment bias for common polymorphisms. by distinguishing derived from ancestral alleles we were able to eliminate the effect of ascertainment bias from our test for selection using a new metric f/ that is able to overcome many of the problems associated ascertainment bias when knowledge of the ancestral state is known. this metric could potentially be useful for a number of studies that rely on information from allele frequency distributions. the high frequency of derived alleles we have identified here could be caused either by selection or reduced ne. reduction in ne appears to have occurred because the ancestral ne predicts a higher herterozygosity than observed. however, the tendency of high frequency, derived alleles to cluster in certain parts of the genome is evidence for positive selection because inbreeding alone does not cause this autocorrelation.

by including a number of wild relatives in the analysis the ancestral alleles were inferred. surprisingly a high proportion of ancestral polymorphisms were identified suggesting that nearly 10% of all of the polymorphisms that are segregating in contemporary populations of b. taurus are ancient in origin and must predate the divergence of bison, yak, banteng and the domesticated cow. these ancestral polymorphisms were therefore used to estimate the ancestral population size of domesticated cattle over the last  <dig> million years, which must have been at least  <dig> . this estimate is roughly  <dig> times greater than the estimate of the effective population size in humans, which has been estimated as  <dig>   <cit> .
