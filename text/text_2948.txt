BACKGROUND
perinatal brain injury occurs in approximately  <dig> per  <dig> births  <cit>  with exposure to hypoxic-ischemic insults and premature delivery  as major contributing factors. the defining feature of neuropathology in hypoxia and ischemia encephalopathy is the injury susceptibility of the periventricular white matter   <cit> . it has been reported recently that the preponderant amoeboid microglial cells  and their activation is associated with the periventricular white matter damage  in neonatal brain after hypoxia  <cit> . amc activation in hypoxia is followed by inflammatory response affecting the axons and oligodendrocytes  <cit> , but the underlying mechanism leading to amc activation has remained uncertain.

burnstock  <cit>  proposed the roles of nucleotides as neurotransmitters. thus, during inflammation or cellular damage affecting the neurons, the adenosine 5'-triphosphate  level in the extracellular spaces is described to be markedly increased  <cit> . it has been reported that atp and its receptor were involved in cell-to-cell communication in physiological and pathophysiological conditions  <cit> . we have shown previously that atp is involved in hypoxia induced microglial activation  <cit> . it has been reported that on exposure to atp, microglia exhibited changes in its electrophysiological properties  <cit>  and increased expression of cytokines in bv <dig> microglial cell line as well as the primary cultured microglial cells  <cit> . microglial cells are known to express p2x receptors  <cit> . atp would then induce various effects through its receptors  <cit> . as a group of membrane cation-selective receptor channels, p2x receptors interact with extracellular atp  <cit> . it has been reported that atp elicits discrete currents of p2x4r on microglia/macrophages  <cit> . in the latter, p2x <dig> receptors are involved in microglial activity in some pathological conditions. for example, the upregulation of p2x <dig> in microglia appears to play a crucial role in contributing to neuropathic pain which has a close relationship with the inflammation  <cit> . suppression of p2x <dig> expression by 2', 3'-0- adenosine 5'-triphosphate)  and pyridoxal phosphate-6-azo   prevents tactile allodynia  <cit> . guo  <cit>  had reported that p2x <dig> expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  was confined to the macrophage cells that infiltrated from the blood, furthermore, p2x <dig> expression reflects the inflammation response during eae. taken together, the above studies strongly suggest that p2x <dig> expression in microglial cells/macrophages may take part in the inflammatory response in injuries of the central nervous system.

the neuroprotective action exerted by tnp-atp and ppads together with the possible use of the purinergic antagonists in the pharmacological treatment of morphine induced migration of microglial  <cit>  and oxygen/glucose deprivation  <cit>  have been considered. wixey and co-workers  <cit>  have reported increased expression of atp receptor p2x <dig> in microglial cells at  <dig> days after 3-day old postnatal rats were exposed to hypoxia-ischemia. however, the expression of atp receptor and its changes after hypoxia in amc in postnatal age, as well as the relationship of p2x <dig> and cytokine expression after hypoxia has remained to be explored.

it is suggested from the above studies that both atp and atp receptors may be jointly involved in microglial activation. the present study sought to explore the possible mechanism of atp induced amc activation after hypoxia in the periventricular white matter and the roles of atp receptors especially p2x <dig> in regulating hypoxia induced cytokine expression in pwmd.

RESULTS
p2x <dig>  p2x <dig> and p2y <dig> immunoexpression in amc in postnatal rat brain
by immunofluorescence double labeling, p2x <dig> amc were distributed preferentially in the cc and subventricular zone  in p <dig> rat brain . there was a total coincidence between ox- <dig> and p2x <dig> in the amc either in the cc  or svz . p2x <dig> and p2y <dig> immunopositive cells were also found in the cc  but the immunofluorescence intensity was noticeably less in comparison with p2x <dig> immunofluorescence. furthermore, the frequency of amc colabeled with p2x <dig> was lower compared to p2x4; even fewer amc were positive for p2y <dig>  p2x <dig> and p2y12-immunoreactive cells were confirmed to be the amc as shown by double immunofluorescence labeling with ox <dig> .

p2x <dig> expression changes in amc in p <dig> hypoxic rats
in p <dig> rats subjected to hypoxic exposure for  <dig> h and sacrificed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> h and  <dig>  14d, double immunofluorescence labeling showed the expression changes of p2x <dig> expression in amc with advancing time. the fluorescence intensity and frequency of p2x <dig> positive cells were noticeably enhanced when compared with the respective matching controls at  <dig> h ,  <dig> h ,  <dig> h ,  <dig> d , and  <dig> d .

western blot analysis showed that p2x <dig> protein expression level of the callosal tissue rich in amc was up-regulated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> h and  <dig> d after hypoxia when compared with the matching controls . at  <dig> d after hypoxia, p2x <dig> expression level was comparable to that of the matching controls .

tnf-α, il-1β and p2x <dig> expression after hypoxia and blockade with ppads/tnp-atp in primary microglial cells
following hypoxia, tnf-α and il-1β mrna expression in microglial cells in vitro was significantly increased. additionally, by western blotting analysis, il-1β and tnf-α protein expression was significantly increased following hypoxia treatment  <cit> . we next investigated the link between the il-1β, tnf-α protein expression and p2x <dig> in hypoxic microglia. primary microglial cells were blocked with ppads, a blocker of p2x1- <dig>  5- <dig>  this resulted in decreased il-1β and tnf-α protein expression after hypoxic exposure. a more drastic decrease in tnf-α  and il-1β  protein expression was observed in hypoxic microglial cells blocked with tnp-atp.

morphological changes of amc after hypoxia and following treatment with ppads/tnp-atp
following hypoxia, the external morphology of primary culture amc underwent changes. the cell body of hypoxic microglia appeared to be more rounded. after ppads treatment, the cells emitted long extending processes. indeed, the cells appeared more ramified in tnp-atp treated hypoxic microglial cells .

discussion
microglial cells are motile immune-competent cells which assume a highly branched morphology in mature stage referred to as ramified microglial cells. in the early brain development, the microglial cells show a different phenotype characterized by a round or oval cell body with a variable number of stout processes and are referred to as the amc  <cit> . they are preferentially located in the subcortical white matter notably the cc and the svz. the cells monitor the brain parenchyma under physiological conditions at different stages.

recently, it has been reported  <cit>  that amc activation is involved in pwmd after hypoxia in the brain through the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by the cell type. in this study, we have focused on the mechanism of amc activation after hypoxia. it was hypothesized that amc may be endowed a specific mechanism in their activation in hypoxia. in this connection, we have reported previously that amc express voltage gated potassium channel kv <dig>   <dig> which may be linked to hypoxia and lipopolysaccharide induced amc activation. additionally, atp can induce kv <dig>   <dig> expression and cytokine release in amc after hypoxia  <cit> . it is well documented that free atp is increased in hypoxic brain tissue  <cit> . it was surmised that atp may be an important stimulus for microglial activation that may exacerbate the brain damage. this takes into consideration of the recent evidence that amc are directly involved in pwmd causing damage to both the axons and myelin forming cells, oligodendrocytes  <cit> . here, we provide evidence of the mechanism of hypoxia induced amc activation after hypoxia, which is via atp receptors.

p2x <dig> expression during development
there is strong evidence indicating that neuronal degeneration in the brain typically develops as a result of microglial activation which is critically dependent on atp receptor. atp receptors are divided into ionotropic purinoceptor and metabolic purinoceptor. ionotropic purinoceptors include p2x <dig> and p2x <dig>  while metabolic purinoceptors include p2y <dig>  ramified microglial cells express both ionotropic and metabolic purinoceptors  <cit> . however, expression of atp receptors in amc especially during development has remained to be explored. indeed, there is only a modicum of information related to this by wixey et al  <cit> , who reported expression of p2x <dig> expression in microglial cells in postnatal rats at  <dig> days of age. more evidence for this would be desirable to confirm p2x <dig> localization in the amc with typical morphology during development. we have confirmed this by double immunofluorescence labeling with ox- <dig> which demonstrated that p2x <dig> was indeed localized in amc, but also extended the fact that p2x <dig> and p2y <dig> were also localized in the same cell type but the expression was evidently less intense. it is striking that p2x <dig> is the predominant atp receptor in the amc in the developing brain while p2x <dig> and p2y <dig> are detected in only a subpopulation of amc. this differs from the ramified microglial cells in the adult rat brain  <cit> . in adult rat brain, p2x <dig> has been reported to be involved in some pathological conditions  <cit> . it is speculated that p2x <dig> may be actively involved in the amc activation in early brain development whose function may be related to the susceptibility in injury of the pwm in hypoxia.

expression of p2x <dig> in amc after hypoxia in postnatal rats
it has been reported that in some pathological conditions, expression of p2x4-receptor  a subtype of ionotropic purinoceptor increases in microglia, but not in neurons or astrocytes  <cit> . additionally, p2x <dig> appears to play a crucial role in contributing to neuropathic pain  <cit>  and p2x <dig> expression reflects the inflammation response during eae  <cit> . up-regulation of p2x <dig> expression was also detected in microglial cells at  <dig> days in a 3-day old rat's hypoxia-ischemia model  <cit> , but the expression changes of p2x <dig> with time after hypoxia in p <dig> rats in amc have remained to be fully clarified.

the present results have shown that increased p2x <dig> expression in amc was sustained from  <dig> h to  <dig> d after hypoxia in newborn rats. this is evidenced by double immunofluorescence labeling of p2x <dig> in amc at different time points. this is consistent with the western blot analysis which shows a significant increase in p2x <dig> expression in the callosal tissue when compared with the matching controls. it is to be noted that there is a significant increase in p2x <dig> expression at  <dig> h and  <dig> d after hypoxia. wixey et al  <cit>  reported increased p2x <dig> expression at  <dig> d only after hypoxia-ischemia injury. here we showed that p2x <dig> expression was increased at an early time point after hypoxia in p <dig> rats. the discrepancy may be due to different experimental animal models used. in our study, we have used p <dig> rats subjected to hypoxic exposure. a marked increase in p2x <dig> expression was detected at p <dig> after hypoxia. interestingly, this is the time point whence severe inflammatory response was noted in the pwm in a perinatal rats' hypoxic model  <cit> .

at later time points e. g. at  <dig> d after hypoxia, the p2x <dig> expression was comparable to that in the matching normal controls. this suggests that while p2x <dig> expression in amc is acute in onset in response to hypoxia, it subsides with time. a possible explanation for this may be that at early stage of hypoxia neuronal damage is more severe and, hence, extracellular atp level is high. the concentration of free atp in the brain may decrease at the later stage of hypoxia when cellular repair and regeneration are in progress. we have reported previously that a higher atp concentration would elicit bv- <dig> microglial cell activation more profoundly  <cit> . a sudden surge in free atp is expected in the acute and early phase of hypoxia. this would induce a stronger p2x <dig> expression at the early stage than the later stage of hypoxia. it has been reported that ramified microglia recruitment to the site of ischemia and hypoxia impairment is associated with cellular loss and p2x4-r are involved in cellular activation  <cit> . in this regard, the neuroprotective actions exerted by tnp-atp and ppads and the possible use of purinergic antagonist in the pharmacological treatment of oxygen/glucose deprivation have been considered  <cit> . although p2x <dig> expression and inflammation after hypoxia-ischemia in the rat brain have been investigated after intraperitoneally injection of minocycline  <cit> , the use of selected p2x <dig> antagonists to suppress amc activation and associated inflammation in the postnatal brain after hypoxia has not been explored.

p2x <dig> induced amc activation and release of cytokines after hypoxia
there is ample evidence to suggest that atp is involved in microglial activation specifically in the ramified phenotype in the adult brain  <cit> . on the other hand, the role of atp in amc activation especially the mechanisms in hypoxia have remained elusive. this is an important issue since amc activation can lead to pwmd in perinatal hypoxia. during hypoxia damage affecting the neurons, the atp level in the extracellular spaces is described to be markedly increased  <cit> . here we detected an obvious increase in p2x <dig> expression in  <dig> d rats after hypoxia at p <dig>  when the inflammatory response is most severe in this model  <cit> . hence, we hypothesize that p2x <dig> mediates the inflammatory response in amc subjected to hypoxia.

in the present study, primary microglial cells were subjected to hypoxia. our results showed that after hypoxic exposure, il-1β and tnfα protein expression was increased in primary microglial cells suggesting the activation of the cells. along with this, the external microglial morphology also was altered. additionally, increased p2x <dig> expression in primary microglial cell after hypoxia was also detected by confocal microscopy. we reported previously microglial activation after atp exposure. both il-1β and tnf-α mrna and protein levels were significantly increased after atp treatment  <cit> . it was therefore concluded that atp can induce microglial activation after hypoxia. in the present study, we confirmed that expression of atp receptor p2x <dig> both in vivo and in primary cultured amc.

hypoxia induced amc activation as reflected by increased production of tnf-α and il-1β was suppressed following the application of ppads and tnp-atp, the selective blocker of p2x1- <dig>  5- <dig> and p2x1- <dig>  <cit> , respectively. it is noteworthy that the external morphology of amc returned to its resting state after treatment with both blockers suggesting that the latter can reduce activation of microglial cells. it is further suggested that p2x <dig> can regulate hypoxia induced amc activation and take part in increased production of il-1β and tnfα after hypoxia. targeting p2x <dig> with its specific blocker may therefore be a potential therapeutic strategy to attenuate neuroinflammation in hypoxic brain in which high levels of atp are expected to inundate the brain tissues.

the expression of tnfα can be blocked partially by ppads; however, a more obvious suppression was exerted by tnp-atp. expression of il-1β was suppressed only by tnp-atp indicating its closer relationship to p2x <dig> expression in hypoxic microglia. the precise modulating mechanism of il-1β and tnf-α expression after hypoxia awaits further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
we show here that amc express atp receptors p2x <dig>  p2x <dig> and p2y <dig> notably the first named receptor in hypoxia in neonatal brain. it is suggested that the prevalent atp receptor p2x <dig> may be linked to regulation of amc activation for production of proinflammatory cytokines especially in altered environment such as hypoxia. therefore, unraveling the purinergic receptors, specifically p2x <dig> in its modulatory mechanisms for amc activation may provide new therapeutic strategies for hypoxia induced injuries in the postnatal brain.
