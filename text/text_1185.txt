BACKGROUND
intermuscular bones  and ribs both are a part of skeletal system of fish. ibs, which occur only in teleosts amongst recent vertebrates, are segmental, serially homologous ossifications in the myosepta  <cit> . these small bones make big troubles for edible and surimi product processing, as well as reduce the flesh quality because they are difficult to remove  <cit> . the position in the myosepta distinguishes the ibs from ribs, which are found not in myosepta but in the muscle axialis  <cit> . meanwhile, ribs develop from cartilage bone, which develop from a mesenchymal cell population derive from the ventral somite. unlike ribs, ibs develop directly from mesenchymal condensation. since 1960s, researchers gradually began to realize the significance of studying ibs in fish . however, these studies primarily focused on morphology, number and distribution of ibs in different fish species. as to the genetic resources of bone tissues for fish species, vieira et al. used the comparative transcriptome analysis to characterize regulation mechanism of the vertebrae and gill arch in the gilthead sea bream   <cit> . our previous study has revealed the molecular properties of ibs through microrna  transcriptome analysis  <cit> . however, until now, the chemical composition of fish ibs and ribs has not been investigated. how many proteins of ibs and ribs may contain as well as which kind of differential expressed proteins existing between ibs and ribs remain unclear.

proteomics is a large-scale, high-throughput, systematic study of a certain type of cell, tissue or body fluid composition of all proteins and an emerging discipline for proteins composition  <cit> . in post-genomic era, proteomics had been widely applied to various fields. zhang et al. investigated the proteome of the oyster  shell by mass spectrometry   <cit> . fan et al. applied 2-de  proteomics approach to investigate altered proteins in hepatopancreas of white shrimp  during cold stress  <cit> . as to fish species, lucitt et al. constructed zebrafish  embryonic protein expression profiles by 2de lc-ms/ms  method  <cit> . kültz et al. studied biochemical differences of kidneys between marine and freshwater three spined sticklebacks  by lc–ms/ms method  <cit> . martyniuk et al. identified hepatic proteins associated with masculinization in female fathead minnow  liver by using itraq  technology  <cit> . those studies involved in diverse biological processes of proteomics in fish species, including embryonic development, masculinization process, environmental adaption, and so on. multiple reaction monitoring  was a powerful tool for targeted proteomics and was an emerging field of proteomics, which had high reproducibility across complex samples  <cit> . currently, itraq discovery combined with subsequent mrm confirmation has been adopted to determine key protein biomarkers in diseases. muraoka et al. and kaur et al. identified key proteins biomarkers in disease by itraq proteomics combining with mrm assays, respectively  <cit> . liu et al. used itraq proteomics combining with mrm assays to study the proteins associated with active immunization of subterranean termite   <cit> . in the present study, the itraq proteomics together with mrm analysis could contribute to a better understanding of the development mechanism for ibs and ribs in teleosts.

blunt snout bream , belonging to cyprinidae, is a typical aquaculture species with ibs in china. this fish could reach the maturation at 2-year old and the growth of individuals decrease a lot once it gets the maturation. in the present study, we want to construct the first proteomics map for fish bones including ibs and ribs, as well as to identify the differentially expressed proteins between ibs and ribs. moreover, we are also interested to find out which kinds of proteins play the important roles during the growing process of ibs and ribs. in order to obtain these objectives, itraq technology and mrm assays were used for proteomics analysis of ibs and ribs from 1- to 2-year old m. amblycephala.

methods
all animals and experiments were conducted in accordance with the “guidelines for experimental animals” of the ministry of science and technology . the study was approved by the institutional animal care and use ethics committee of huazhong agricultural university. all efforts were made to minimize suffering. all experimental procedures involving fish were approved by the institution animal care and use committee of the huazhong agricultural university.

sample collection
all experimental animals were collected from m. amblycephala selective population, which were bred in the tuanfeng fish breeding base of huazhong agricultural university. six 1-year old and six 2-year old m. amblycephala individuals were selected. all specimens were collected on the same day and under the same conditions. the fish were euthanized immediately in well-aerated water containing the 100 mg/l concentration of tricaine methanesulfonate  before tissue collection. tissue samples including ibs and ribs were immediately collected, then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c.

morphological identification
hematoxylin-eosin  staining was used to observe the histological structures of ibs and ribs. considering the convenient for the sectioning of bones, the encircled tissues were also collected along with the ibs and ribs. these tissues were fixed in bouin’s liquid for 48 h, and embedded into paraffin blocks according to the routine procedures. subsequently, the specimens were sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

protein preparation and sds-page electrophoresis
equal amount of tissues samples  from each individual were mixed to grind into powder in liquid nitrogen and then the specific experimental method for protein extracted was referred from the method for protein preparation of liu’s reference   <cit> . the concentration of the protein was measured with bradford method. specific experimental operation for bradford method can refer toyama’s operation  <cit> . the proteins in the supernatant were kept at −80 °c for further analysis. ibs and ribs from three individuals were collected to extract protein for every stage and each stage possessed two biological replicates. so, we have eight protein samples, including 1-year old ib group  and rib group , 2-year old ib group  and rib group .

sds-page  is the most common analytical technique used to separate and characterize proteins, which can detect the integrity of the protein samples  <cit> . in this study, sds-page was used to distinguish the generally different biochemical compositions of ibs and ribs as well as identify the integrity of ibs and ribs’ protein samples. aliquots containing 30 μg of each sample were separated on 10% resolving gels and sds-page analysis revealed clearly distinct band patterns for the ibs and ribs of m. amblycephala from the two developmental stages . the samples were suitable for subsequent analysis and then subjected to trypsin digestion and lc–ms/ms analysis.

quantitative itraq analysis
total protein  was taken out from each sample solution to perform the quantitative itraq lc-ms/ms proteomic analysis. details of itraq labeling, strong cation exchange choematography  fractionation and lc-esi-ms/ms analysis based on triple tof  <dig>  during itraq analysis are given in additional file 1: text s <dig> 

the obtained raw data files were converted into mgf files using proteome discoverer  <dig>  ,  <dig>  msconverter and the mgf file were searched. proteins identification was performed by using mascot  <dig> . <dig>  against database containing  <dig>  sequences. for protein identification, a mass tolerance of 20 da  was permitted for intact peptide masses and  <dig>  da for fragmented ions, with allowance for one missed cleavages in the trypsin digests. gln- > pyro-glu , oxidation , deamidated  as the potential variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl , itraq8plex , itraq8plex  as fixed modifications. the charge states of peptides were set to + <dig> and + <dig>  specifically, an automatic decoy database search was performed in mascot by choosing the decoy checkbox in which a random sequence of database is generated and tested for raw spectra as well as the real database. to reduce the probability of false peptide identification, only peptides with significance scores  at the 99% confidence interval by a mascot probability analysis greater than “identity” were counted as identified. each confident protein identification involves at least one unique peptide.

functional annotations of the proteins were conducted using blast2go program against the non-redundant protein database  and transcriptase data of intermuscular bones for 1-year old m. amblycephala which had been established by us previously . the kegg database  and the cog  database  were used to classify and group these identified proteins.

for protein quantization, it was required that a protein contains at least two unique peptides. the quantitative protein ratios were weighted and normalized by the median ratio in mascot. proteins with 2-fold change and p-value of statistical evaluation less than  <dig>  in the comparison groups of 1-ib-vs-1-rib , 2-ib-vs-2-rib , 1-ib-vs-2-ib  and 1-rib-vs-2-rib  were determined as differentially abundant proteins.

mrm validation of differentially expressed proteins from itraq
mrm assays were used to validate the differentially expressed proteins from itraq analysis  <cit> . details of the mrm analysis were referred to the liu’s reference as well as described in additional file 1: text s <dig>

a total of  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed proteins were identified by itraq proteomics in 1-ib-vs-2-ib and 1-rib-vs-2-rib comparison groups , with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated, respectively . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> proteins were annotated in 1-ib-vs-2-ib and 1-rib-vs-2-rib by cog function classifications, respectively. there were just five classification functions in cog annotation identified for 1-ib-vs-2-ib differentially expressed proteins , including e , f , g , o  and z , with the most number of proteins in z function. some classification functions was just identified for 1-rib-vs-2-rib group and the number of proteins for g  and o  function classifications in 1-rib-vs-2-rib group was more than that in 1-ib-vs-2-ib group.fig.  <dig> comparison of proteins identified in 1-ib-vs-2-ib and 1-rib-vs-2-rib groups, a indicates differential expressed proteins, x-axis: names of the comparison groups; y-axis: the number of differentially expressed proteins; red column: up-regulation proteins; green column: down-regulation proteins. b shows cog functional classification of differentially expressed proteins from itraq data. c shows venn diagram for 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 2-ib-vs-2-rib




among the differentially expressed proteins, the two comparison groups shared  <dig> proteins, among which nine proteins were up-regulated and two proteins were down-regulated . parvalbumin <dig> and parvalbumin <dig> associated with calcium were found to be up-regulated. there were  <dig> specific differentially expressed proteins  in 1-ib-vs-2-ib group , among which titin, fras <dig> related extracellular matrix  <dig> precursor, tnc protein as well as tenascin-like correlated with skeletal proteins were identified. some proteins associated with myosin  and some proteins played a role in metabolism of amino acid permeases and energy  were identified. forty specific differentially expressed proteins  were identified in 1-rib-vs-2-rib group . the value of ratio for actin-related protein  <dig> and myosin light chain was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. collagen α <dig> chain-like was also identified and its mean ratio was  <dig> . moreover, parvalbumin isoform 1d, parvalbumin isoform 4a and insulin-like growth factor  <dig> mrna-binding protein <dig> were identified in 1-rib-vs-2-rib group. some proteins correlated with ca2+ metabolism and skeletal development were also identified.

discussion
the formation of bone includes complex multicellular activities involving various types of cells, with mainly cells being osteoclasts and osteoblasts  <cit> . osteoblasts are related to structural bone and work in teams to build new bone  <cit> . osteoclasts are the cells that degrade bone to initiate normal bone remodeling as well as conduct the function of bone resorption  <cit> . when osteoblasts become trapped in the matrix that they secrete, they become osteocytes. during the bone growth, bone cavity will be enlarged by osteoclasts through bone resorption process. moreover, ikeda et al. reported that osteoclasts activity was regulated with osteoblasts in certain extent  <cit> . factors secreted from osteoclasts, such as ephrinb <dig>  complement component 3a, collagen triple helix repeat containing  <dig>  played a role in combining with osteoblasts receptor and osteoblasts differentiation, further affected bone mass and bone formation. in the present study, after he staining for the ibs and the ribs, osteocyte is the most found cell in tissues, which is in accordance with human bone  <cit> . the osteoclasts and osteoblasts were both observed in histostructures of ibs and ribs, while bone cavity including osteoclasts was specially identified in ribs. these results indicated that there is less bone remodeling and bone resorption process in fish ibs compared to ribs, which maybe the reason that ibs cannot grow as big as ribs.

in this study, the first proteomics data were constructed for fish ibs and ribs in m. amblycephala and a total of  <dig>  proteins were identified. there was a broad range in the biological functions represented by these proteins, with most represented by proteins included cellular process, metabolic process, single-organism process, biological regulation, developmental process, muleticellular organismal process. there has been great success in characterizing the proteome of fish tissues and the present study contributes to this growing body of literature. lucitt et al. identified an impressive  <dig>  proteins in zebrafish embryonic development stages at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, which revealed representation of protein classes relevant for cell function at both developmental stages, including proteins related to structure, transcription/translation, cell cycle, nucleotide metabolism, ion transport, carbohydrate, energy, and lipid metabolism  <cit> . de souza et al. identified  <dig>  proteins in zebrafish gill that represented acid–base regulation, stress, ion balance, and metabolism  <cit> . in the brain of zebrafish, singh et al. identified more than  <dig>  proteins representing hormones and hormone receptors  <cit> . in the female fathead minnows liver, martyniuk et al. reported that 65% of the proteins had a biological role in metabolism and 42% had catalytic activity, which indicated that the female fathead minnows liver proteome is representative of the function of the liver in that it is the major tissue for detoxification and metabolism  <cit> . in this study, there were  <dig> % proteins had a cellular role and metabolic process in biological process,  <dig> % proteins played a role in binding and catalytic activity in molecular function, and  <dig> % proteins made an effect on cell and membrane in cellular component in identified proteins of ibs and ribs, respectively, which suggested that proteins identified by this study may mainly made an effect on bone formation. salmon et al. reported that  <dig> proteins were identified in human alveolar bone by lc-ms/ms, and most proteins involved in cellular process, biological regulation, and metabolic process  <cit> . therefore, proteins function of ibs and ribs were similar with human alveolar bone in terms of go annotation.

the identified proteins for ibs and ribs of m. amblycephala were categorized into  <dig> pathways, which were most represented by these proteins in metabolic, dcm, hcm pathways, focal adhesion, regulation of actin cytoskeleton as well as ecm-receptor interaction. three pathways for focal adhesion, regulation of actin cytoskeleton as well as ecm-receptor interaction had certain correlation in bone development. focal adhesion mainly affected cell proliferation. actin is one of the important cytoskeleton proteins and made an effected on cell moving. ecm is comprised of basic structural proteins, collagens, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins  <cit> . ecm associated skeletal tissue of terrestrial vertebrates had been identified in vertebrae and gill arches of s. auratus  <cit> . in the present study, the different types of collagens were identified, such as collagen type ii, collagen α <dig> chain, collagen α <dig> chain precursor and so on. proteins associated with tgf-β signaling pathway, wnt signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway were represented in ibs and ribs. both of tgf-β signaling pathway and wnt signaling pathway played an important role in the growth and differentiation of osteoblast, which was a part of skeletal tissue and involved in bone formation and differentiation  <cit> . proteins of calcium signaling pathway associated with ca2+ or calcium-related including s <dig> calcium binding protein v <dig>  hemicentin- <dig>  calmodulin were identified. it had been reported that ca2+ could be involved in many intracellular processes, including bone homeostasis, and calcium signaling is regulated by specific calcium-binding proteins  <cit> . meantime, concentration of ca2+ could urge cell to occur stimulus response, and ca2+ could directly act on osteoblast and affect bone formation . so many bone related proteins identified in this study justifies the enrichment of the proteomics for fish bones.

differentially expressed proteins of 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 2-ib-vs-2-rib were analyzed to identify the differentially expressed proteins between ibs and ribs. osteocalcin and annexins a2a protein related with osteoblasts were identified as down-regulated proteins in both 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 2-ib-vs-2-rib groups, which mean they had higher expression in both 1- and 2-year old ribs compared with that of ibs. it had been reported that osteocalcin could induce bone regeneration and have distinct roles in the dentin mineralization process  <cit> , so it may play a critical role in the development and growth of ribs. due to localization of annexins in areas of cartilage and bone mineralization, annexins made an important role in mineralization process. kirsch reported that annexins a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> played a role in physiological mineralization of skeletal tissues  <cit> . annexins a2a may affect bone mineralization and make more effect on ribs than ibs. moreover, biglycan, matrilin  <dig> precursor, collagen , collagen α2) were found as differentially expressed proteins in two comparison groups, and those proteins were a part of ecm pathway which was associated with bone mineralization. above proteins associated with ecm, all was down-regulated proteins and played an important role in ribs growth compared with ibs development. nidogen- <dig> protein was just identified as differentially expressed proteins in 1-ib-vs-1-rib group with up-regulation level, not in 2-ib-vs-2-rib group. nidogen- <dig> was ubiquitous basement membrane proteins with a similar distribution in various organs during development, which could combine with cell membrane receptor and further promote bone formation  <cit> . the up-regulation of nidogen- <dig> proteins in 1-ib-vs-1-rib group indicated it may play a critical role in ibs development compared with ribs. it was reported that vitronectin was characteristic markers for activated osteoclasts in mammals  <cit> . mellis et al. reported that matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> could degrade the organic bone matrix  <cit> . the resorption of mineralized bone matrix by osteoclasts concurs with deposition of new bone by osteoblasts. our results showed two related proteins  were up-regulated in ribs compared with ibs, which was in accordance with the results from histological structures of ribs and ibs as there was no osteoclasts identified in ib internal tissues.

the differentially expressed proteins in 1-ib-vs-2-ib and1-rib-vs-2-rib groups were analyzed to identify the proteins for the growth development of ibs and ribs, respectively. parvalbumin- <dig> and parvalbumin- <dig> associated with osteocyte were found being differentially expressed in both 1-ib-vs-2-ib and 1-rib-vs-2-rib groups. these two proteins had been reported to play a role in calcium signaling, through being correlated with calcium-binding protein and affecting relationship of troponin c combining with ca2+  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulation of parvalbumin- <dig> and parvalbumin- <dig> in both groups indicated their important roles in the development of ibs and ribs. tenascin-like, tnc, titin and fras <dig> related extracellular matrix  <dig> precursor were identified as specific differentially expressed proteins in 1-ib-vs-2-ib. tenascin c  is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein synthesized by osteoblasts during bone growth and morphogenesis, which was reported to affect mineralization of osteoblast-like cells by matrix vesicles . powers et al. study had proved that titin protein made an effect on skeletal muscle sarcomeres  <cit> . according to our results, the up-regulation  and down-regulation  proteins may be the key proteins in regulating the ibs’ development. collagen α <dig> chain-like and myosin light chain were identified as specific differentially expressed proteins for 1-rib-vs-2-rib. collagen is the main composition of fish bone and connective tissue and involved in cell differentiation and multiplication  <cit> . there are about  <dig> different types of collagen having been identified in mammals, while just types i, ii, v and xi had been reported in fish species  <cit> . myosin light chain protein is correlated with ca2+ binding protein and could affect bone formation. lai et al. reported that myosin light chain affected contractility of skeletal muscle in female mice  <cit> . in this study, collagen α <dig> chain-like and myosin light chain both were up-regulated protein and they may play important roles in regulating ribs growth and development. demambro et al. reported that insulin-like growth factor-binding protein- <dig> is required for osteoclast differentiation and was related with the skeleton in mammals  <cit> . the up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor  <dig> mrna-binding protein  <dig> identified in 1-rib-vs-2-rib may be similar with role of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein- <dig> and could regulate bone growth. these results suggest that there are different key proteins involved in development mechanisms of ibs and ribs.

in addition, we screened out four pathways proteins related to bone development and cluster analysis indicated their different expression levels in ibs and ribs. calcium act as important second messengers for many intracellular processes including bone homeostasis  <cit> . extracellular matrix , such as collagen, fibronectin, involved in bone mineralization and is critically important for cell growth, survival, differentiation and morphogenesis  <cit> . mapk pathway is crucial for osteoclasts formation and differentiation and made an effect on bone mass  <cit> . gnrh can stimulate the expression of annexin a <dig>  <cit> , which had been reported to express in vertebrae of s. auratus and involved in bone mineralization  <cit> . in the present study, different expression levels of the proteins from these four pathways indicated their possible important functions in the development of ibs and ribs.

in two comparison groups, mrm analysis was successfully used to validate differentially expressed proteins in each group. among the validated proteins, collagens, fibronectin and osteomodulin are component of extracellular matrix and form tissue structure  <cit> . ohara et al. reported that fish collagen can promote the synthesis of proteoglycans in guinea pig tibial epiphysis  <cit> , and therefore it may affect the treatment of osteoarthritis. fibronectin and osteomodulin both were associated with collagen fibrils to contribute tissue strength  <cit> . tanaka et al. found that osteoglycin could affect osteoblasts type and made an effect on expression of runx <dig>  and osterix  <cit> . in the present study, collagen, fibronectin precursor and osteomodulin as well as osteoglycin precursor from itraq data were analyzed by mrm in the two comparison groups. in 1-ib-vs-1-rib, the up-regulation of osteoglycin precursor and osteomodulin protein may play a more important role in ibs than ribs growth. collagen α <dig> and collagen α <dig> chain and collagen α <dig> chain were down-regulated proteins, suggesting that these three proteins may make a more effect on development of ribs than that of ibs. in 1-ib-vs-2-ib, the up-regulation of osteoglycin precursor, osteomodulin, collagen α <dig> and collagen α <dig> chain validated by mrm may be key proteins in ibs growth. in addition, laminin and tnc protein from itraq date that were associated with ca2+ were further validated by mrm, and these two proteins were up-regulated in two comparison groups may affect cell differentiation and further make an effect on bone formation.

quantitative proteome is a powerful technology for large scare of differential proteins between different samples. among the different methodologies, stable isotopes labeling by amino acids in cell culture   <cit> , isotope-code affinity tags   <cit>  as well as itraq used in the present study are commonly employed. although itraq analysis allows identification of more proteins than previous 2-de proteomics and more reliable quantification of the proteins, a large number of proteins can also not be detected by mass spectrometry. therefore, the proportionally large number of proteins classified in this study is not necessarily an accurate representation of the protein composition related to fish ib and rib. moreover, the performance of a concomitant proteomic and gene expression by throughput sequencing analyses would be expected to offer more reliable results.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study utilized itraq methodology to construct the first proteomics map for fish bones including ibs and ribs, which increase knowledge about the proteins functioned in fish tissues. the identified  <dig>  proteins represent the most comprehensive fish bone proteomes to date. moreover, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed proteins were identified in comparison groups of 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 2-ib-vs-2-rib, as well as  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed proteins were identified in comparison groups of 1-ib-vs-2-ib and 1-rib-vs-2-rib. some proteins were identified to have more important functions for the development of ibs or ribs, such as myosin-7-like, tnc protein, tenascin-like, fras <dig> related extracellular matrix <dig> precursor as well as myosin heavy chain fast skeletal type  <dig> for ibs, and actin-related protein  <dig>  collagen α <dig> chain-like as well as parvalbumin isoform 1d for ribs. the obtained protein data from present study will contribute to a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ibs and ribs development and the roles of proteins playing in regulating diverse biological processes in fish.
