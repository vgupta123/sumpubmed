BACKGROUND
chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen with unique biphasic developmental cycle alternating between the infectious elementary body  and the metabolically active reticulate body . based on the antigenic variation of the major outer membrane protein , the c. trachomatis isolates have been divided into three different biovariants  <cit> . serovars a, b, ba and c cause ocular infections, currently infecting  <dig> million people worldwide  <cit> , <cit> ; serovars d, e, f, g, h, i, j and k cause sexually transmitted disease with more than  <dig> million new cases of genital infections occurring every year  <cit> , <cit>  and serovars l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> cause lymphgranuloma venereum  primarily affecting the lymphatic system with recent outbreaks in western europe  <cit> , <cit> . comparative genomic studies demonstrate that the genome of c. trachomatis serovars are strikingly similar to each other and share more than 99% identity  <cit> , <cit> . genetic differences were observed centring around the plasticity zone i.e. ~50 kb region near the predicted termination origin of the genome, experiencing a higher degree of dna arrangement  <cit> , momp and members of polymorphic membrane protein  gene family  <cit> . however the occurrence of quantitatively different infections by different serovars within a given host has been intriguing. in vivo studies infecting mice intranasally  <cit>  or intravaginally  <cit>  with different serovars of c. trachomatis has revealed a great deal of variation in infection kinetics. genome analysis could reveal that a functional tryptophan synthase enzyme and toxin might be the principal virulence factors underlying this distinct tropism in terms of organ specific disease termed as organotropism  <cit> . studies including lgv serovars confirmed the observation that the variability resided mainly in the plasticity zone  <cit> .

chlamydia primarily targets the host epithelial cells and resides within distinct membrane bound vacuoles termed as chlamydial inclusion. the chlamydia proliferate within inclusion and inhibits their acidification by avoiding fusion with lysosomal compartments  <cit> , <cit> . however the association of c. trachomatis with reactive arthritis have raised questions how chlamydia is transported from the site of infection to the site of inflammatory disease in the joints or vasculature  <cit> - <cit> . studies have shown that the c. trachomatis infection is characterized by infiltration with polymorphonuclear leukocyte  in the acute phase and mononuclear cells in the chronic phase  <cit> . hence there have been suggestions that circulating monocytes delivers the pathogen to other organs and initiate immunological response and inflammation. the role of c. pneumoniae infected monocytes as a vector, transmitting the pathogen to vascular wall, has been elucidated earlier  <cit> . the c. trachomatis infection of monocytes in vitro, have mostly resulted in noncultivable state in which the bacteria although metabolically active could not produce active infectious particle when recultured in hela cells  <cit> , <cit> .

dendritic cells  are the first professional antigen presenting cells encountering the bacteria after initial infection. dcs are very efficient in processing and presenting bacterial antigens and play a crucial role in activating t cell-dependent immune response  <cit> , <cit> . studies have illustrated the role of dcs to evoke strong immune responses against chlamydial infections by stimulating t cell reaction  <cit> , <cit> . there are contrasting evidences of the fate of c. trachomatis within dcs; there has been observations that c. trachomatis inclusion fuses with lysosomal compartment  <cit>  while another study confirmed that the chlamydial inclusion did not colocalize with lysosome associated membrane protein   <dig> or major histocompatibility complex  ii compartments  <cit> . c. trachomatis infection of dcs was characterized by up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules and secretion of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . previous studies have implicated cytokines ifn-γ as well tnf of inducing indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase , an enzyme catalysing the degradation of tryptophan leading to chlamydial growth arrest  <cit> - <cit> . the presence of a functional tryptophan synthase in the urogenital serovars while its absence in the ocular serovars  <cit> , <cit>  has been considered to be pivotal. the genital serovars survive by utilizing indole produced by vaginal microbial flora as a substrate for tryptophan synthesis in ido induced tryptophan-depleted culture medium  <cit> .

however, little is known about the growth characteristics of the different biovariants of c. trachomatis in monocytes and dcs -the two major immune cells that the bacterium encounters during infection. hence we selected three serovars ba, d and l2; representative of the ocular, urogenital and lymphogranuloma serovars respectively, for comparative study in human monocytes and monocyte- derived dcs. in our study we observed the chlamydial morphology within infected monocytes and dcs; analyzed their metabolic activity and could illustrate the cytokine induced inflammatory response. we were also able to propose the distinct immune response pathways employed by c. trachomatis infected monocytes and dcs.

methods
chlamydia culture
chlamydia trachomatis serovars d/uw-3/cx and serotype lgv ii strain  <dig> were kindly provided by prof andreas klos  and chlamydia trachomatis serotype ba apache- <dig> was kindly sent by prof eberhard straube .

bacterial stocks were prepared as described previously  <cit> . briefly, hela cell monolayers infected with c. trachomatis serovar ba, d and l <dig> ebs were cultivated at 37°c and 5% co <dig> in earle's mem containing glutamine, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum ,  <dig>  m nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate  along with 1 μg/ml cycloheximide . ebs from infected cells were harvested at 48 hours  to 72 hours  p.i., purified by  <dig> step ultracentrifugation and collected in transport medium . the final stock was stored in small aliquots in transport medium at −80°c until use. mock control was prepared following the complete propagation, harvest and purification procedure for ebs in the absence of c. trachomatis infection. all the stocks were free of mycoplasma as tested by venor gem kit . to quantify the eb, the inclusions were counted and the eb determined as inclusion-forming-units /ml. for heat inactivation, ebs of c. trachomatis serovars ba, d and l <dig> were treated at 75°c for 30 minutes. all the plastic wares were obtained from greiner bio-one  unless otherwise mentioned.

culture of monocytes and monocyte-derived dcs
heparinized buffy coats from healthy blood donors were obtained from blutspendedienst nstob springe, bremen, germany. buffy coats were prepared from whole blood collected from volunteer donors under informed consent according to the current german hemotherapy guidelines  <cit> . peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were isolated by ficoll-hypaque density gradient centrifugation using lymphocyte separation medium . for each experiment a different blood donor was used. monocytes were isolated by negative selection using the monocyte isolation kit ii  according to manufacturer’s protocol .

monocytes were seeded on poly l-lysine  coated 24-well plate at a density of 3× <dig>  allowed to adhere for 2 hours before infection and cultured in rpmi- <dig>  containing 10% fcs. for dcs, 3× <dig> monocytes were cultured in rpmi- <dig> medium with autologous serum in 24-well plate for 7 days in the presence of il- <dig>   and gm-csf   as described previously  <cit> .

infection of monocyte and monocyte-derived dc
monocytes and the monocyte-derived dcs were infected with c. trachomatis serovars ba, d and l <dig> at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> by centrifugation for 30 min at 400 × g with further incubation for 30 min at 37°c in 5% co <dig>  following incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline  to remove extracellular bacteria. fresh rpmi- <dig> containing 10% fcs was added to infected monocytes and rpmi- <dig> with autologous serum was added to infected dcs. the infected cultures were incubated at 37°c and 5% co <dig> for intended durations. for immunofluorescence, cells were grown on coverslips. infected cells were harvested by rubber scraper at different time points as per experimental protocol. the cell pellets for pcr/reinfection as well as supernatants for cytokine analysis were stored at −80°c. mock infected controls were prepared for every set of experiment to assess the contribution of host cell debris. control samples were routinely checked for the presence of chlamydia antigens in the donor samples by immunofluorescence microscopy.

immunofluorescence microscopy
the infected monocytes and dcs after intended incubation were fixed in 2% para-formaldehyde for 10 min and washed  <dig> times in pbs. cells were permeabilized with  <dig> % tritonx- <dig> for 3 minutes. following fixation, the cells were blocked with pbs containing 1% bsa and 1% fcs. genus-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate -labelled monoclonal antibody  was used to stain the chlamydial inclusions, while the monocytes and dcs were counterstained with evan’s blue at room temperature for 45 min. the samples were then washed once with pbs and then washed twice with pbs/dapi  to stain the cell nuclei. images were captured in  <dig> random fields with a fluorescence microscope  with standard filters at 63x magnification. imagej was used to count the number of inclusions/cells in replicate samples. data from  <dig> independent experiments were combined to calculate the mean and standard deviation.

analysis of the infectivity of c. trachomatis in monocytes/dcs
cells harvested at different time points were lysed in an ultrasonic sonicator bath . cell lysates were used to infect hela cells seeded on coverslips and cultured in mem media containing 1 μg/ml cycloheximide at 37°c in 5% co <dig> for the intended duration. at the end of the infection period, cells were fixed for 10 min in absolute methanol, air-dried, and stained using fitc-labelled monoclonal antibody  and counterstained with evan’s blue. images were captured in  <dig> random fields with a fluorescence microscope  with standard filters at 40x magnification. the inclusions were counted as described under section immunofluorescence microscopy. data from  <dig> independent experiments were combined to calculate the mean and standard deviation.

gene expression analysis by real-time pcr
for the analysis of chlamydial gene expression, infected cells were harvested at different time points and real-time pcr was performed targeting the 16s rrna gene as described previously  <cit> . to analyse chlamydial developmental phase, expression of genes euo, ompa and omcb were performed. all the primers were ordered from eurofins mwg operon . briefly, total rna was isolated from the cell pellets of infected monocytes or dcs using the macherey nagel kit .  <dig> nanogram of rna was reverse-transcribed from each sample using the eurogentec reverse-transcription kit. real-time pcr was performed using the qpcr core kit  in roche lightcycler  <dig> system. the gene expression levels were calculated by the delta-delta ct  method  <cit> , normalized to 16s in case of chlamydial genes and to 18s for host genes, and compared to the mock sample as the reference gene. the specificity and identity of the amplified products were determined using light cycler  <dig> melting curve analysis software. data from  <dig> independent experiments with pool of  <dig> donors were combined to calculate the mean and standard deviation.

quantification of cytokines
the level of the cytokines il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf and il-12p <dig> were measured in the supernatants of the infected monocytes and dcs collected 1 day p.i. by cytometric bead array  according to the manufacturer's instruction. in brief, 50 μl of human inflammation capture bead suspension and 50 μl of phycoerythrin detection reagent were added to an equal amount of samples or standard dilution and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature in the dark. the monocyte samples were diluted 1: <dig> and dcs samples were diluted 1: <dig> with assay diluent to have sample data within the range of the standard curve. subsequently, samples were washed with wash buffer and centrifuged at 200 × g at room temperature for 5 minutes. the samples were further fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes. the supernatant was discarded and 300 μl of wash buffer was added. samples were then analysed on a bd facs calibur flow cytometer . the data was analyzed using the fcap array software . data from  <dig> independent experiments with pool of  <dig> donors were combined to calculate the mean and standard deviation.

innate and adaptive immune response array
the human innate and adaptive immune response array  was performed using the sybr green-based rt <dig> profiler system . this pcr array is a pathway focused array that contains a set of  <dig> related genes involved in the inflammatory immune response. this assay also contains  <dig> housekeeping genes and  <dig> other reaction controls to assess genomic dna contamination, rna quality, and general pcr performance. total rna from infected monocytes and dcs were extracted using macherey nagel kit . due to the low rna concentration, monocyte rna sample were amplified by rt <dig> preamp pcr master mix . equal amount of rna from each sample was reverse-transcribed to cdna by using reverse-transcription mix preceded by a genomic dna elimination step; both provided in the kit. the amplification of the immune genes in the samples was investigated by real-time pcr on roche light cycler  <dig> according to the manufacturer's instructions. data analysis was performed using manufacturer’s program and is based on the ddct method, with normalization of the raw data to the panel of housekeeping genes provided in the array. the genes showing modulation by  <dig>  fold up or down were only selected for further analysis. functional annotations of the selected genes were carried out by the bioinformatics software david for bioinformatics. three independent experiments with a pool of  <dig> donors each were analyzed.

statistical analysis
statistical evaluation of the data was done using graphpad prism  <dig> software. student t-test was performed for simple comparison between  <dig> means. for multiple comparisons, the results were analysed by two-way anova followed by bonferoni’s post-test. p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant. all shown data are representative for at least  <dig> independent experiments.

RESULTS
chlamydia trachomatis infect monocytes and monocyte-derived dcs in a comparable manner
monocytes isolated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  and monocyte-derived dcs were infected with c. trachomatis serovars ba, d and l <dig> . results show that all the three serovars were capable of infecting both the monocytes and dcs and form inclusions as detected by immunofluorescence microscopy 2 days post infection . however, the inclusions were smaller in size compared to typical inclusions that have been reported in hela cells . the inclusion morphology and staining intensity varied between the infected monocytes and dcs.

in monocytes, the percentage of infected cells were comparable among the three serovars and did not seem to change even when the infection duration was extended to 3 days . for dcs, the percentage of infected cells were similar for serovars ba and d but serovar l <dig> showed a higher infection rate as compared to the other two . however, the infection rate declined remarkably for all the three serovars when infected for 3 days. the infection rate was nevertheless much lower in both monocytes and dcs than in hela. mock controls were prepared for each round of experiments which showed absence of chlamydial antigens in the donors .
c. trachomatis
serovars ba, d and l2

monocytes, dcs and hela cells were infected with chlamydia trachomatis serovars ba, d and l <dig> and stained with anti-chlamydia lps antibody at 2 day and 3 day p.i.. quantification of chlamydia infected cells were done by counting total number of cells  and cells positive for chlamydia and from  <dig> pictures the mean and ± sd were calculated from three independent experiments.

differential development of c. trachomatis serovar l <dig> in monocytes and dcs
in our study, we further investigated the survival and re-infection potential of chlamydia serovars after the primary infection of monocytes and dcs. chlamydia-infected monocytes and dcs were harvested 2 days p.i. and passaged onto hela cell confluent monolayer. hela cells were investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy 2 days p.i. and the inclusions were counted.

the serovars ba and the d were not able to produce inclusions in hela cells after infecting either monocytes or dcs for 2 days. only scattered antigens could be detected . interestingly, serovar l <dig> produced inclusions in hela cells after infecting both monocytes and dcs . there was no recovery of infectious progeny from serovars ba and d even with longer duration of primary infection  or if the passage in hela cells was carried out for a longer duration  . in the case of serovar l <dig>  passaging for longer time did not yield a higher number of infectious progeny.

metabolic activity of chlamydia within infected monocytes and dcs
to characterize the metabolic activity of chlamydiae in monocytes and dcs, we investigated the expression of 16s rrna gene transcripts which reflects the growth rate and/or metabolic activity of chlamydiae in the cells  <cit> . the expression of 16s rrna in chlamydiae-infected monocytes and dcs was assessed over 3 days after infection.

16s rrna was highly expressed in the infected monocytes for all three chlamydia serovars ba, d and l <dig> throughout the 3 day time course of infection . the heightened metabolic activity of the intracellular chlamydia did not seem to decline with a longer duration, thus indicating that all the serovars were viable and metabolically active within the monocytes.

in contrast 16s rrna expression level was negligible in dcs for serovars ba and d at 1 day p.i. and further declined with infection progression . serovar l <dig> displayed highly significant expression of 16s rrna at 1and 2 day p.i. although the level declined on the 3 day p.i., the expression remained significant .

to further characterize developmental state of chlamydial serovars within the infected monocytes and dcs, gene expression of euo, ompa and omcb were investigated. each of these genes are known to be expressed at different developmental stages of chlamydiae , and have previously reported to be transcriptionally altered during chlamydial growth in human monocytes and dcs  <cit> , <cit> . figure  <dig> depicts the expression of the three genes in monocytes and dcs respectively. expression of the  <dig> genes within serovars ba and d in both cell types was similar and stable, albeit at low levels in all the three time points that were investigated. serovar l <dig> depicted a different pattern; early stage gene euo was significantly expressed 1 day p.i. compared to serovars ba and d, gradually diminishing with time in both monocytes and dcs. the expression of mid-cycle gene ompa for serovar l <dig>  although higher than the serovars ba and d, was not statistically significant in infected monocytes. the expression for ompa within infected dcs peaked at 2 day p.i. significant to both serovars ba and d. expression of late stage gene omcb increased significantly 3 days p.i. for serovar l <dig> compared to serovars ba and d in both monocytes and dcs.

indolamine  <dig>  3-dioxygenase expression is down-regulated in monocytes and upregulated in dcs by c. trachomatis serovar l2
one aspect of chlamydial infection is the gamma-interferon  mediated induction of indolamine- <dig>  3-dioxygenase , an enzyme catabolizing breakdown of tryptophan in culture media. the unavailability of this essential amino acid can lead to chlamydial growth arrest termed as persistence  <cit> . the role of tnf-α mediated ido induction in dcs  <cit>  as well ifn-γ independent ido activation in monocytic thp- <dig> cells have been reported earlier  <cit> . we considered that the level of ido gene expression could be crucial in understanding the contrasting infection outcome by the chlamydia serovars in monocytes and monocyte-derived dcs. hence the expression of ido gene in chlamydiae-infected monocytes and dcs was detected over 3 days post infection.

monocytes, infected with serovars ba and d expressed higher levels of ido 1 day post infection . contrastingly, ido expression by serovar l <dig> infected monocytes was significantly down-regulated 1 day p.i compared to serovar d. on the other days of infection the trend was similar but not significant.

ido expression was significantly up-regulated in dcs infected with serovar l <dig>  compared to serovars ba and d. ido expression declined throughout the infection course for all the servers, however maintaining a significant expression for serovar l <dig> infection.

attempts were made to enhance chlamydial recovery from infected monocytes and dcs by addition of tryptophan, known to be depleted by ido during chlamydial infection  <cit> , <cit> . however the infected cultures supplemented with tryptophan  when passaged on hela cells could not abrogate the growth arrest; chlamydial inclusions could not be recovered from serovar ba and d cultures . however, serovar l <dig> could produce chlamydial inclusions irrespective of tryptophan.

differential cytokine response induced in monocytes and dcs by chlamydial infection
we investigated the role of cytokines in mediating contrasting infection outcome of chlamydia infection the monocytes and dcs. supernatants were collected from monocyte and monocyte-derived dcs culture infected with c. trachomatis serovars ba, d and l <dig> at 1 day p.i. and cytokine responses were assessed by cytokine bead array.

as depicted in figure  <dig>  infection of monocytes and monocyte-derived dcs with chlamydial serovars ba, d and l <dig> could induce detectable secretion of cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-1β, il- <dig> and tnf. production of il-12p <dig> was below the standards .

pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1β and tnf was elevated in the chlamydiae infected monocytes than the mock control, however were not statistically significant. the level of cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> in infected monocytes showed no statistical difference with mock control. the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> was induced in higher levels than the mock with serovar ba infection secreting significant amounts compared to mock. dcs infected with serovars d and l <dig> showed significantly up-regulated levels of tnf. the other pro-inflammatory cytokine il-1β although secreted in higher amounts within serovar l <dig> infected dcs, than the other serovars or mock, was not significant. dcs infection resulted in significant production of inflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> levels were low in the infected dcs and were not statistically significant to the mock control. to understand lps contribution in the observed cytokine responses, monocytes and dcs were infected with heat-killed c. trachomatis serovars ba, d and l <dig> ebs at moi- <dig> and the cytokine levels were investigated . heat-killed ebs for serovar ba and d induced significantly low level of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in monocytes while the tnf levels were low in dcs for serovar d and l <dig>  the most remarkable observation was the negligible induction of il- <dig> by heat-killed ebs from all  <dig> serovars in monocytes which was highly significant.

immune gene response to c. trachomatis infected monocytes and dcs
to determine the host genes activated by chlamydia infection, the immune response was analyzed by human innate and adaptive immune response array. genes differentially regulated  <dig>  fold up or down in monocytes or monocyte-derived dcs infected with c. trachomatis serovars ba, d and l <dig> 24 hours p.i. were considered for further analysis .

as depicted in figure  <dig>  serovar ba induced up regulation of  <dig> genes, serovar d of  <dig> genes and serovar l <dig> of  <dig> genes within infected monocytes. of these up-regulated genes  <dig> genes were common in all  <dig> serovars which included receptor for bacterial components  and genes responsible for antibacterial defense . cytokine genes inducing antiviral effect  as well as immune-regulation  were also elevated emphasizing the cytokine interplay in infected monocyte. it is noteworthy that toll-like receptor   <dig> which recognizes dsrna and is crucial for the trif mediated immune response pathway  was up-regulated. trem <dig> gene, which is an important sepsis marker, was elevated in serovar l <dig> infected monocytes.

the down-regulated genes in the infected monocytes numbered  <dig> for serovar ba,  <dig> for serovar d and  <dig> for serovar l <dig> . ten of those genes were common for all the  <dig> serovars which included a member of myd <dig> dependent pathway  and interacting protein . other genes involved were predominantly involved in vascular mechanism . additionally, some genes involved in apoptosis and oxidative process  were also down-regulated.

dcs response to the chlamydial serovars were also intriguing. there was up regulation of  <dig> genes by serovar ba,  <dig> genes by serovar d and  <dig> genes by serovar l <dig> . the remarkable observation was that serovars ba, d and l <dig> could all up regulate tlr <dig> as well other tlrs individually , all belonging to the myd <dig> dependent signalling pathway  <cit> .

the genes down regulated in dcs in response to chlamydial infection numbered  <dig> for serovar ba,  <dig> for serovar d and  <dig> for serovar l <dig>  two genes were common which included anti-inflammatory effector  as well as gene involved in vascular process .

discussion
in our study we could demonstrate that the different serovars of c. trachomatis experience altered fate in monocytes and dcs by virtue of the variable host immune response induced by infection. monocytes and dcs could be primarily infected by c. trachomatis serovars ba, d and l <dig> in comparable degree. this is in agreement with previous study showing similar results in terms of primary infection of dcs by c. trachomatis <cit> . to our knowledge, no such study has been reported for monocytes, hence we report here for the first time characteristics of c. trachomatis serovars ba, d and l <dig> infection in monocytes. the infection percentages were comparable for serovar ba and d while serovar l <dig> experienced a slightly higher rate in both monocytes and dcs infection. incidentally the percentage declined in infected dcs with longer culture period for all the three serovars. the variable inclusion morphology and lower infection rate within chlamydiae-infected monocytes and dcs as opposed to in hela indicated that replication cycle of c. trachomatis was somewhat restricted in these two immune cell types.

attempts to recover infectious particles from the monocytes and dcs infected with the chlamydia serovars led to an interesting observation. monocytes infected with serovars ba and d when passaged to hela cells could not produce any inclusions, which is in accordance with earlier studies demonstrating inability of serovar k to productively infect monocytes  <cit> , <cit> . in contrast to earlier observations  <cit>  where mononuclear cells were considered to be microbicidal for all c. trachomatis serovars our results revealed that serovar l <dig> could productively infect monocytes.

a similar trend was observed in dcs, where serovar ba and serovar d showed abortive infection with no typical inclusions. infectious particles could only be recovered from serovar l <dig> infected dcs as has been reported previously by gervassi et al. <cit> . however gervassi et al. showed that serovar e passaged in dcs could be further propagated in hela cell whereas in our study serovar d, member of the same biovariant could not be propagated in hela cells. the differences between these findings can be caused by effects of genetic human host polymorphism , differences in culture condition , or use of different mois  <dig> vs 3).

in conjunction with the reinfection data, high expression levels of 16s rrna within monocytes infected with serovars ba, d and l <dig> indicated that c. trachomatis serovars were viable throughout the infection period, even though infectious progeny could only be recovered from l <dig> infected monocytes. this phenomenon of viability without producing infectious bodies is known as chlamydial persistence  <cit> , <cit> . serovar k infection of monocytes resulted in attenuation of new eb production although genes involved in chlamydial dna replication were expressed during persistence  <cit> . nevertheless our study establishes that this is a general phenomenon occurring in monocytes for several serovars of c. trachomatis biovariants. contrasting observations are provided by dcs infected with the chlamydial serovars. the absence of recovered infectious progeny along with the negligible expression of 16s rrna in serovars ba and d in infected dcs 2 days p.i. suggest the loss of metabolic activity of c. trachomatis serovars within dcs. this loss of metabolic activity of c. trachomatis serovars within dcs indicated towards a probable degradation of chlamydiae. serovar l <dig> could however, produce inclusions during reinfection studies and express 16s rrna 2 days p.i. in dcs but suffered rapid decline in viability 3 days p.i.. dcs have shown the ability to degrade chlamydia psittaci and c. trachomatis mopn  <cit>  but other dc- c.trachomatis studies have shown contrasting results, where they showed that c. trachomatis serovars were confined within specific vacuoles within dcs being able to replicate  <cit> , <cit> . our results were in contrast to chlamydia pneumoniae infected dcs showing an increase in 16s rrna expression when infected for 3 days  <cit> . the study of the chlamydial developmental cycle within the monocytes and dcs by expression of stage-specific genes showed a clear prominence of serovar l <dig> compared to serovars ba and d. the observed gene expression for serovar l <dig> was in accordance with the expected early, mid and late phase patterns and therefore indicative of presence of viable chlamydiae. the difference in gene expression between serovar l <dig> and the serovars ba and d indicates the infection severity. the expression of ompa and omcb genes for serovars ba and d, within monocytes and dcs, at later time points indicate that some chlamydiae were still viable. while in monocytes these chlamydia were in persistent form, it is possible that in dcs transient level of c. trachomatis development is allowed while predominantly inhibiting or degrading the pathogen as it has been reported previously for other monocytic cells  <cit> .

the presence of a functional tryptophan synthase gene in urogenital serovars and the absence of it in ocular serovars has been related with tissue tropism  <cit> , <cit> . the tryptophan synthase gene enables the bacteria to use indole as a substrate for tryptophan synthesis when the intracellular tryptophan is depleted by ido induction during chlamydial infection. in this study, we have shown that ido expression levels for ocular serovar ba and urogenital serovar d were similar while lgv serovar l <dig> showed down-regulation in infected monocytes. in infected dcs, ido expression was significantly up-regulated for serovar l <dig> but declined rapidly in the other two serovars. the involvement of tnf secreted by dcs  seemed to be crucial in the up-regulation of ido, as tnf has been earlier reported to activate ido expression in human dcs  <cit> . the heightened level of ido in serovar l <dig> could not restrict its active infection probably due to the presence of functional tryptophan synthase in genital serovars as discussed above. ido expression revealed analogous pattern for serovars ba and d in both monocytes and dcs which poses a query whether the organotropism is less pronounced within the immune cells.

in infected monocytes the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf and il-1β were secreted in higher levels than mock which might be the reason for the restricted chlamydial growth observed, higher secretion of these cytokines has also been reported previously  <cit> . the significance of tnf in serovar d and l <dig> infected dcs confirmed their role in restricting chlamydial growth. the inflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> although secreted in higher levels by the infected monocytes were not significant. one probable reason for such high volumes could be due to the monocyte adherence for 2 hours prior infection which might have induced some activation. the fact that il- <dig> was highly induced by serovars ba, d and l <dig> within monocytes demonstrates the critical role played by the anti-inflammatory process to prevent degradation of chlamydia and remain viable within the monocytes. dc infection with serovars ba, d and l <dig> could induce significant levels of inflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the anti-inflammatory il- <dig> was secreted in low levels by the serovars, thus displaying dominance of the inflammatory process in dc infection. the distinct interplay of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines seemed to play role in infection outcome within monocytes and dcs. the cytokine studies with heat-killed ebs showed that tnf was induced by active infection of dcs by serovars d and l <dig>  infection by viable chlamydia could only induce secretion of il- <dig> in monocytes, indicating that an active infection is essential for inducing these particular cytokines in monocytes or dcs. the data demonstrated that monocytes and dcs induce altered levels of cytokines in response to chlamydial infection, and dcs demonstrate a stronger inflammatory role than the monocytes.

our data manifested distinct activation profiles of immune genes in monocytes and dcs during c. trachomatis infection. although, the fold-regulation was not significant, the differential regulation of the different genes when analysed through functional annotation tool, david for bioinformatics, could reveal an interesting pattern. the hallmark of this response was the involvement of the toll like receptor  signalling pathway-critical mediators of innate immune response recognizing different microbial components  <cit> - <cit> . on contact with their ligands, tlrs engage different adapter molecules to propagate the downstream signalling. the adapter molecule myd <dig> is used by all the tlrs  to activate the transcriptional activator nf-κb and induce secretion of tnf, il- <dig> and other inflammatory cytokines thus forming the myd <dig> dependent pathway  <cit> , <cit> . the other pathway recruits trif adapter molecule to induce ifnβ and late induction of nf-κb constituting the myd <dig> independent pathway  <cit> , <cit> . tlr <dig> is able to signal exclusively through myd88-independent pathway  <cit> . the involvement of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in c. trachomatis mediated infection response has been reported by earlier studies  <cit> , <cit> . in our studies the up-regulation of tlr <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifnb <dig> for serovars ba, d and l <dig> in infected monocytes and the simultaneous down regulation of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> suggests the dominance of the trif mediated signalling in c. trachomatis infected monocytes. the converse could be seen in c. trachomatis infected dcs where tlr <dig> was up-regulated for all the serovars and tlr/2/4/ <dig> of myd <dig> signalling pathway were differentially up-regulated for the different serovars. with the array findings, one could speculate that two distinct immune response pathways are employed by monocytes and dcs when infected with specific chlamydial serovars. the results could be further studied in detail to ascertain the role played by the different adapter mediated signalling pathways in chlamydia infection.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrated that c. trachomatis serovars ba, d and l <dig> infected monocytes and dcs in a comparable manner; however, they underwent differential infection consequences. serovars ba and d became persistent in monocytes while they degraded within dcs. serovar l <dig> could, however, maintain the development cycle in both monocytes and dcs, although the process was severely impaired. the heightened levels of inflammatory cytokines secreted by the chlamydial infection in dcs compared to monocytes could be instrumental to the differences observed. the host immune genes response to infection displayed distinct activation profile within monocytes and dcs. collectively, we could establish that the host pathogen interaction in chlamydia infection is not only serovar specific but also cell specific.
