BACKGROUND
transposable elements  have been found in most eukaryotic genomes and often constitute a significant portion of the genome . because they can transpose from one location to another within the genome or across genomes, the identification of tes and analysis of their dynamics are important for a better understanding of the structure and evolution of both genomes and tes themselves  <cit> . based on the mechanism of transposition, tes are categorized into two major classes. the elements in class i  are transposed through reverse transcription of an rna intermediate, whereas the elements in class ii  are transposed through a cut-and-paste transposition mechanism  <cit> . ltr retroelements, one type of class i retroelements, are characterized by long terminal repeats  at their 5' and 3' ends, and encode genes required for their retrotransposition . in several species, ltr retroelements have amplified to high levels resulting in major modifications of the host genome 

in order to identify ltr retroelements in whole genome sequences, many computational methods have been developed  <cit> . de novo approaches search for putative pairs of ltrs in the genome  <cit> . the identified ltrs can then be combined with other important sequence features, including target site duplications  and conserved protein domains, to identify intact ltr retroelements. once the intact ltr retroelements are found, homology-based searching  can be used to identify additional fragmented elements and solo ltrs in the genome.

although newly-sequenced genomes may contain many tes, it is often unclear what proportion of the identified elements remains active in the population. recent advances in tiling array technology provide opportunities for measuring gene transcription levels at a genome-wide scale, which can also be used to detect the activity of the tes that are identified in silico. even though transcription of tes is not sufficient to cause their transposition, it is a necessary first step for mobilization of retroelements. in addition, recent work suggests transposable elements may upregulate expression of host genes  <cit>  or, more generally, that tes may function as part of genome-wide regulatory networks  <cit> . because transcription patterns of tes are known to vary under different environmental conditions and/or at developmental stages, analysis of transcription profiles is the first step towards understanding what factors might induce mobilization of tes in the host genome.

transposon display can be used to compare differences in te load among individuals or populations over time or from different regions. one of the features of the host genomic environment that has been proposed to significantly impact te mobility and distribution is the frequency of recombination  <cit> . because d. pulex is a cyclical parthenogen, it is possible to assess the role of recombination in te proliferation in this species without many of the confounding variables that have plagued past comparisons . this is because natural populations of d. pulex are known to lose the ability to reproduce sexually  and sexual reproduction can be suppressed or promoted by manipulating laboratory conditions. thus, it is possible to use this system to look more closely at the short-and long-term impact of recombination on te abundance by combining laboratory and field comparisons.

the analysis of d. pulex presented in this paper represents the first such data for a freshwater aquatic arthropod and cyclical parthenogen and provides an opportunity to better understand the dynamics of tes via comparison with other well-studied systems. ltr retroelements have been shown to exert a strong impact on the genome of other organisms  and may be capable of similar mobility and influence in this species as well.

RESULTS
identification of ltr retroelements in the daphnia genome
intact ltr retroelements were identified using multiple empirical rules: similarity of a pair of ltrs at the both ends, the structure of internal regions , di-nucleotides at flanking ends, and tsds. the definition of intact ltr retroelement was adapted from previous studies  <cit> , and is limited to those that encode protein domains such as gag and pol and have pairs of ltrs at both ends. the intact elements identified were clustered into families based on the sequence similarity of ltrs between elements . the program mgescan-ltr  <cit>  identified  <dig> intact ltr retroelements in the d. pulex genome and clustered them into  <dig> families . the identified elements include  <dig> bel,  <dig> copia,  <dig> dirs, and  <dig> gypsy elements, which were clustered into  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> families, respectively . among these,  <dig> elements have a pair of tri-nucleotides  flanking the ends of the ltrs and tsds ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length.

in order to understand how the ltr retroelements in the d. pulex genome are different from those in other invertebrate genomes, we applied mgescan-ltr  <cit>  to four additional genomes: anopheles gambiae, bombyx mori, drosophila melanogaster, and oryza sativa. although these genomes have been analyzed in previous studies  <cit> , we searched for the intact ltr retroelements following the same procedure used for d. pulex . the elements that we identified using our pipeline largely overlap with previously described elements for each species. small differences might be due to the difference between the versions of genomic sequences and/or the criteria used in these analyses.

distribution of ltr retroelements in different groups
to date, gypsy is the most abundant among the four main groups of ltr retroelements  in invertebrate genomes such d. melanogaster, b. mori, and a. gambiae  <cit> . in particular, the gypsy elements in the d. melanogaster genome belong to one of three main lineages gypsy, mdg <dig>  and mdg <dig>  <cit> , whereas the elements in the a. gambiae genome belong to five distinctive lineages, including two additional lineages, csrn <dig> and mag  <cit> . a total of  <dig> intact gypsy elements from  <dig> families were identified in the d. pulex genome, which corresponds to 46% of all intact ltr retroelements identified in this study . the phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptase  sequences from these elements revealed that they consist of two major subgroups. one has high sequence similarity to the mag lineage, but the other is distant from any known major gypsy lineages . among the  <dig> families in the first subgroup, the neighbor-joining tree shows that the family dpul_g <dig> is close to the mag element , whereas dpul_g <dig> and dpul_g <dig> are close to the surl element . notably, the elements in dpul_g <dig> family are closest to the mag elements  found in chlamys farreri, which contain only a single open reading frame  encoding both gag and pol proteins.

copia elements are known to be more abundant in plant genomes than animal genomes   <cit> . only a small number of copia elements have been identified in invertebrate genomes  <cit> , including the copia and  <dig> families in the d. melanogaster genome, and the mosqcopia elements in the aedes aegypti genome. interestingly, our results indicate that the copia group is highly abundant and diverse in the d. pulex genome. a total of  <dig> intact copia retroelements  were identified, which constitute 29% of all intact ltr retroelements identified in the d. pulex genome. the ratio of the numbers of intact copia to gypsy elements is  <dig> , which is very high compared with other insect genomes . the rt sequences from the d. pulex retroelements and some representative elements from other genomes  were used in the phylogenetic analysis. d. pulex copia elements were roughly clustered into two subgroups. one subgroup consists of four elements , and the other subgroup consists of the remaining elements .

the d. pulex genome has fewer bel elements compared with other insect genomes for which data exist , which have more bel elements than copia elements . a total of  <dig> intact bel retroelements were identified and clustered into  <dig> families, which correspond to 20% of all intact ltr retroelements found in this genome. the bel/pao retroelements are known to have four major lineages: cer, pao/ninja, bel/moose, and suzu  <cit> . six bel families identified in the d. pulex genome were close to the cer retroelements from c. elegans in the neighbor-joining tree . the other  <dig> bel families in the d. pulex genome were close to the pao/ninja lineage.

dirs retroelements typically contain inverted repeats instead of direct repeats, and are typically much shorter than classic ltrs  <cit> . hence, we modified mgescan-ltr program accordingly to search for proximal inverted repeats and orfs encoding proteins such as rt and tyrosine recombinase . a total of  <dig> intact dirs retroelements  were identified in the d. pulex genome, which correspond to 6% of all elements identified in this genome. given that no dirs element has been identified in any previously surveyed arthropod genome except tribolium castaneum  <cit> , d. pulex has the largest number of dirs elements among the arthropods so far.

transcriptional activity of ltr retroelements
the first step of the transposition of ltr retroelements is transcription. the transcribed elements are then reverse transcribed into dna and inserted into the host genomes by themselves or with help of other autonomous elements. however, all the transcribed elements are not necessarily transposed into host genomes. therefore, the analysis of transcriptional activity can help assess the potential mobility of the ltr retroelements. we used expression tiling array data sets from six separate experimental conditions for our analysis . the transcriptome of adult females was compared to that of adult males to assess sex-based differences in ltr retroelement activity . the transcriptome of mature stage-specific female animals exposed to metals was compared to similar stage reference samples to assess human-induced environmental stress conditions . finally, the transcriptome of 4th instar juvenile females exposed to predator kairomones from the dipteran larvae chaoborus was compared to similar stage reference samples to assay transcription levels under natural environmental stress conditions . transcriptionally-active regions  on the tiling array were observed across the entire genome . we located overlapping regions between the tars and all  <dig> ltr retroelements identified in this study to determine the transcription levels of the corresponding elements . in total,  <dig> elements overlap with at least one of the tars, including  <dig> bel,  <dig> copia,  <dig> dirs, and  <dig> gypsy elements. a similar ratio of transcriptionally active copia to gypsy elements  was observed relative to the ratio of total number of copia to gypsy elements in the whole genome sequence . eleven families  consisting of more than one element overlapped with the tars.

among  <dig> elements with detectable transcriptional activity,  <dig> elements show long tars , as listed in table  <dig>  the element dpul_c <dig> shows very long tars  with high expression level  in the adult female data set. interestingly, the elements dpul_c <dig> and dpul_c <dig>  both show significant transcriptional activity  and long tars , but have relatively low ltr similarities . pairwise alignment of their ltr pairs showed that the relatively low similarities were due to a short fragment  inserted in one of the ltr sequences. therefore, these elements might still represent a recent insertion, and remain transcriptionally active in the natural d. pulex population since low similarity is mainly caused by the insert of single short fragment instead of several accumulated mutations.

among the three experiments under different conditions, dpul_g <dig> and dpul_g <dig> showed transcriptional activity across all six different conditions. on the other hand,  <dig> elements were expressed in only one of the conditions. the expression pattern of these ltr retroelements is shown for each condition . the elements showed higher overall transcriptional activity in the dataset of adults, including female and male  than in the other two data sets . in the kairomone-exposed condition, more elements were transcribed than in the control set .

transposable element dynamics in lab-reared lines and natural populations
in order to assess the role of reproductive mode in retroelement distribution and abundance among sexually-and asexually-reproducing isolates, we developed a transposon display assay for two families of dirs elements identified in the d. pulex genome. we chose dirs elements because they exhibited intact open-reading frames  and were low-copy number . we surveyed mutation-accumulation  lines of d. pulex to try and identify if there was any detectable activity and if patterns differed among lines where sex was promoted or prohibited. in addition, we compared te loads for these two families of retroelements among natural populations in which sex occurs annually , and in which it does not occur .

in mutation-accumulation lines, no germline gains were detected in either retroelement family assayed in the ma lines, but putative somatic gains occurred regularly in both treatments . rates of loss were higher in sexuals than in asexuals in the family for which any losses were observed , but losses were not randomly distributed across loci. instead, they occurred at a subset of the loci scored , presumably those that were heterozygous for the insertion at the beginning of the experiment. the average number of losses at these "high loss" loci was  <dig>  which is very close to the number that would be predicted simply based on segregation of chromosomes and the probability of loss for heterozygous insertions given the sample size of sexual lines surveyed here .

in natural populations, the same two families of dirs retroelements were surveyed among isolates where sex occurs at least yearly  and where sex has been completely lost . mean copy number did not differ between cyclical parthenogens and obligate asexuals for dpul_d <dig> but did for dpul_d <dig>  with copy number in cyclicals exceeding that in asexuals almost threefold . in addition to higher loads in sexuals, dpul_d <dig> also exhibited higher insertion site polymorphism among isolates from sexually-reproducing populations compared to obligate asexuals . unlike the pattern observed in dna transposons , for the dirs elements we observed a higher number of singletons  in cyclically-parthenogenetic isolates relative to obligate asexuals .

discussion
composition of d. pulex ltr retroelements
in this study, we have identified  <dig> intact ltr retroelements in the d. pulex genome which were clustered into  <dig> families. with the library of intact elements identified,  <dig> ltr retroelements were found by using repeatmasker. these retroelements constitute  <dig> % of the d. pulex genome, which is much higher than d. melanogaster   <cit>  and lower than that found in b. mori   <cit> . these levels are all, however, much lower than those found in plants which are known to typically have a much higher proportion of ltr retroelements in their genomes . in addition to quantifying the ltr retroelement content, our survey showed that the families of ltr retroelements in d. pulex are more divergent than previous whole genome analyses have shown. for example, while only  <dig> copia elements were identified in d. melanogaster  <cit> , in d. pulex there are  <dig> families . in all invertebrate genomes surveyed in this study, the number of copia families are very low , which is also consistent with previous studies  <cit> . our study also confirmed the presence of  <dig> dirs elements in the d. pulex genome, which is much higher than any other invertebrate genomes sequenced so far. only a few dirs elements have been found in t. castaneum  <cit> , dictyostelium discoideum, and some fish , but none have been identified in the model organisms d. melanogaster, a. gambiae, and o. sativa.

survey of transcriptional activities in ltr retroelements
since transcription of the ltr retroelements is the first step required for their transposition, genome-wide screening of transcriptional data was used to determine what proportion of the ltr retroelements might be active. tiling arrays use unbiased probes, in contrast to cdna microarrays which are designed to target gene expression alone, thus providing a general picture of expression patterns under various conditions. overall, the transcription of more than 20%  of the intact ltr retroelements was detected in the d. pulex genome. for the purpose of comparison, we retrieved the expression pattern for  <dig> intact non-ltr retroelements that were identified in the d. pulex genome  <cit> , and found that only eight  elements showed transcriptional activity and one of them had significantly long tars . additionally, we collected tiling array data for d. melanogaster at different developmental stages from the encode website  and matched the tars with the annotated ltr retroelements. in total,  <dig>  intact elements from  <dig> families match with tars, including  <dig> bel,  <dig> copia, and  <dig> gypsy elements. four elements from roo and rover families that have been shown to transpose previously  <cit> , also showed transcriptional activity here . the ltr retroelements in d. pulex exhibit higher transcriptional activity  than those in d. melanogaster, even though there are fewer intact ltr retroelements identified in the d. pulex genome than those in the d. melanogaster genome.

several elements in plant genomes are known to be able to transpose under specific conditions . our study shows that the kairomone-exposed daphnia show higher te transcription levels than controls. notably, under the same condition, the protein-coding genes of daphnia also showed an overall higher transcription level, implying that global transcription activity is induced under the kairomone-exposed condition. on the other hand, the transcription level of ltr retroelements is not significantly different in the experiments comparing female vs. male and metal exposure. although our analysis shows general trends in transcriptional activity, further experiments are required to investigate the activity of individual ltr retroelement families.

tes as components of the dynamic genome
although no germline gains were observed in the mutation-accumulation lines, evidence for putative somatic gains was observed in both dirs families assayed, providing additional evidence that there may be active retroelements in the d. pulex genome. the higher rate of putative somatic gains observed in lines in which sex occurred for the dpul_d <dig> family is the opposite of the trend observed in dna transposon families . in addition to gains, lineages undergoing sex exhibited frequent losses for one family assayed, presumably because this family included heterozygotic copies  at the beginning of the experiment, which subsequently were lost 25% of the time via independent assortment of chromosomes during sex . this difference highlights the importance of reproductive mode for the accumulation of mutation loads in the genome. sexually-reproducing organisms can purge deleterious mutations  during recombination. asexuals cannot purge te insertions . as asexuals accumulate new mutations over time , it is thought that their fitness will decline and eventually they will go extinct  <cit> .

although the results of the transposon display assay support the idea that tes may build up in asexual lineages over time, the data from the natural isolates indicate that, in nature, sexual isolates build up higher te loads than asexuals, at least in one of the two families assayed . this result corroborates previous studies in d. pulex on the dna transposon pokey assayed among natural populations  <cit> . the increased number of tes in sexuals could be explained in a number of ways. first, despite the increased efficiency of selection in sexual lineages, sex is a good way for new te copies to spread among lineages in a population . it is also possible that te copies in recombining genomic backgrounds are able to better evade host suppression mechanisms because there is a higher chance of meiotic recombination among te copies and therefore the production of novel genotypes undetectable by co-evolved suppression mechanisms. alternatively, recombination events among retroelements belonging to the same family may render individual copies inactive, leading to a build-up over time of inactive copies in sexual lineages which is less likely in asexuals. lastly, obligate asexuals that are able to persist in nature may represent isolates that evolved from especially low load sexual lineages, thereby minimizing the so-called "lethal hangover" from their sexual ancestors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have performed a genome-wide analysis of the ltr retroelement content of the d. pulex genome, the first aquatic microcrustacean and cyclical parthenogen for which such an analysis has been performed. we identified  <dig> intact ltr retroelements in the d. pulex genome, and categorized them into bel/pao, copia, dirs, and gypsy groups, respectively. as with other insects such as d. melanogaster and a. gambiae, the major group of retroelements in the daphnia genome is gypsy, which includes almost half of the intact retroelements identified in this study. notably, a very significant number of intact copia retroelements were identified as well. in addition, the d. pulex genome has been found to house the most dirs elements among the arthropod genomes sequenced to date.

transcriptional activity of intact ltr retroelements was surveyed by using tiling array data across the whole genome sequence. a total of  <dig> ltr retroelements showed expression signals, among which  <dig> elements contain long tar regions. transposon display assays of two intact dirs retroelements were also performed and provide evidence for possible activity in mutation-accumulation lines of d. pulex. patterns of te load and polymorphism in natural populations indicate sexually-reproducing isolates have heavier te loads and higher insertion site polymorphism among isolates for one family. consistent with previously identified dirs elements in fish and other animals, the daphnia dirs elements assayed here exhibit different structures of ir and protein domains , compared with the elements from the other three groups. further investigation of population-level differences for other families identified in this survey will help pinpoint which families of ltr retroelements remain active in the d. pulex genome and the extent to which they may influence genome evolution in this species.
