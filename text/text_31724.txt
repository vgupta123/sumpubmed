BACKGROUND
atp-sensitive  channels are widely expressed in both excitable and non-excitable tissue types throughout the body. however, differences exist in the functional and pharmacological properties of various katp channels in different tissues. this functional diversity of katp channels is also reflected in the cardiovascular system. katp channels are abundantly expressed in ventricular myocytes, where they are probably best characterized. these channels have a high unitary conductance, are inhibited by atp in the micromolar range, are blocked by glibenclamide  and opened by pinacidil . katp channels also exist in the coronary vasculature, where they function to maintain basal coronary blood flow  <cit> . katp channels in the coronary smooth muscle have a low unitary conductance  and are blocked by glibenclamide and activated by katp channel openers and adenosine  <cit> . katp channels exist in the coronary endothelium  <cit> , but their biophysical properties remain largely unidentified. in addition to this diverse distribution of plasmalemmal katp channels in the heart, katp channels with unique biophysical and pharmacological profiles are also believed to be expressed in the mitochondrial inner membrane  <cit> .

katp channels are increasingly well characterized at the molecular level. in order to express a functional channel that resembles native katp channels in terms of their biophysical and pharmacological properties, a combination of two types of subunits is necessary. it is now understood that kir <dig> subunits form a pore-forming structure through which k+ ions transverse the membrane whereas sur subunits assemble with the latter to modulate the channel's function and to confer unique pharmacological properties to the channel complex  <cit> . two genes each code for the two known kir <dig> subfamily members  and for the two known sur members . alternative splicing of sur <dig> gives rise to at least two functionally relevant isoforms  with distinct pharmacological profiles  <cit> . it is widely believed that ventricular katp channels consist of the specific combination of kir <dig>  and sur2a subunits and that katp channels in vascular smooth muscle consist of kir <dig>  and sur2b subunits. this view is consistent with results from gene targeting experiments, which demonstrate the absence of functional sarcolemmal katp channels in ventricular myocytes from kir <dig>  mice and the coronary abnormalities that develop in kir <dig>  and sur <dig> null mice  <cit> . although they are powerful tools, gene knockout approaches can overemphasize certain important aspects of gene function and may overlook more subtle effects of protein function and interaction. at first sight, these models do not adequately explain the reports of sur <dig> mrna expression in the heart  <cit> , or the observation that anti-sur <dig> antisense oligonucleotides inhibit katp channels of ventricular myocytes  <cit> . they also do not provide a functional basis for the known expression of kir <dig>  mrna and protein in cardiac myocytes  <cit> . or explain the molecular composition of the endothelial katp channel. the specific cellular and subcellular localization of proteins can be used to predict their function. we therefore used antibodies specific for each of the katp channel subunits to determine their cellular and subcellular localization in the mouse and rat heart. our results suggest distinct roles for each of the katp channel subunits in diverse cardiac structures.

RESULTS
given the reports of expression of each of the katp channel subunits in the heart , we performed immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry to determine the cellular and subcellular localization of kir <dig> , kir <dig> , sur <dig> and sur <dig> subunits in mouse and rat ventricle. to this end, we stained frozen sections of cardiac ventricular tissue as well as cardiac myocytes enzymatically isolated from mouse and rat hearts. where possible, we used different antibodies to the subunits to ensure that the staining pattern observed was specific.

characterization of the antibodies used in this study
we performed western blotting to determine the specificity of the antibodies used in this study. three different anti-kir <dig>  antibodies  all detect a band that migrates with an apparent molecular size of  <dig> kda in western blotting of rat heart membrane fractions . a  <dig> kda band was also detected by the 78a antibody . these antibodies did not cross-react with kir <dig> , since they detected only kir <dig>   in parallel experiments on cells transfected with various katp channel subunit combinations .

both the 76a and g- <dig> anti-kir <dig>  antibodies have previously been characterized and we demonstrated that they specifically detect a ~ <dig> kda band in western blotting of kir <dig>  transfected cells and do not detect heterologously expressed kir <dig>  protein  <cit> . here we show that both of these antibodies also detect kir <dig>  subunits as a ~ <dig> kda band in western blotting of heterologously expressed kir <dig>  protein or rat heart membrane fractions .

the anti-sur <dig> antibodies specifically detect sur <dig> protein  in cell lysates of cos7l cells transiently transfected with sur1/kir <dig>  cdna as well as in membrane fractions obtained from mouse hearts  <cit> . in the cell lystates from sur2b/kir <dig>  transfected cells, the sur <dig> antibody recognizes a specific band at  <dig> kd in transfected cells only  and did not detect sur <dig> . thus, each of the antibodies used in this study detected proteins at the correct molecular size in western blotting and did not cross-react non-specifically with other proteins.

kir <dig>  localization in the murine heart
we used an immunohistochemistry approach to identify the localization of kir <dig>  protein in cryostat sections of mouse ventricles. we used three separate antibodies that produced similar results . we also used another anti-kir <dig>  antibody  but this antibody did not perform well in these assays. a typical result is shown in fig 2a where kir <dig>  protein was ubiquitously detected throughout the ventricle. closer inspection shows that kir <dig>  protein is expressed in a sarcomeric striated pattern in ventricular myocytes. this effect is more pronounced in epicardial myocytes . in the midmyocardium, a punctate staining pattern is apparent . this was observed in over  <dig> different cryosections that we examined .

the cylindrical shape of the punctate structures in fig 2c is reminiscent of coronary blood vessels. we tested various antibodies to find suitable markers for smooth muscle- and endothelial cells in the coronary vasculature. we found antibodies against smooth muscle α-actin to be a good marker for coronary vessels  typically having diameters upwards of about  <dig> μm. we also tested an antibody against the apical endothelial protein icam- <dig> and found the antibody to detect endothelial cells lining the inner layer of coronary arteries . additionally, the anti-icam- <dig> antibodies stained a large number of smaller vessel-like structures having diameters typically smaller than  <dig> μm . these smaller vessels apparently do not have an appreciable amount of vascular smooth muscle cells, as judged by the lack of smooth muscle α-actin staining, suggesting that they may be coronary capillaries . to examine the localization of kir <dig>  in coronary blood vessels, we co-stained mouse ventricle with naf- <dig> anti-kir <dig>  antibodies and anti-icam- <dig> antibodies . as shown in figure 2d, there is clear correspondence between kir <dig>  staining and icam- <dig> localization, suggesting high expression levels of kir <dig>  in the coronary vasculature.

given the high sensitivity of the naf- <dig> antibody, we were able to perform a sub-cellular localization study of kir <dig>  protein in the mouse heart . we co-stained a cryostat section with antibodies against smooth muscle α-actin , kir <dig>   and the endothelial icam- <dig> protein . an overlay of these three images is shown in panel b. a higher magnification of the area roughly represented by the boxed area  demonstrates that kir <dig>  subunits are ubiquitously expressed and are present in ventricular myocytes, the coronary smooth muscle walls as well as in endothelial cells. of these cells types, the highest expression levels appear to occur in the vasculature.

kir <dig>  localization in the murine heart
we used several antibodies against kir <dig>  subunits to determine their cellular localization. both the 76a and the g- <dig> antibodies  gave similar results. the w <dig> antibody developed by us  <cit>  did not seem to stain more than background and we therefore assumed this antibody not to work in this assay. in terms of staining in the vasculature, we detected kir <dig>  subunit expression mainly in the endothelium  and not in smooth muscle . evidently, kir <dig>  subunits were expressed in cardiac myocytes as well, as demonstrated in fig 5b. the staining occurs in a sarcomeric striated pattern in ventricular myocytes . although not as apparent as with kir <dig> , there appears to be expression of kir <dig>  subunits in small coronary blood vessels . these structures are also stained by kir <dig>  antibodies , suggesting co-localization of kir <dig>  and kir <dig>  subunits in small coronary blood vessels.

subcellular localization of katp channel subunits in enzymatically isolated ventricular myocytes
fixation and permeabilization procedures can affect the outcome of immunocytochemistry experiments. we therefore compared three different methods. isolated cardiac myocytes were  fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with triton x- <dig>   fixed and permeablized in a single step by ice-cold methanol or  subjected to a two-step protocol with paraformaldehyde fixation followed by methanol fixation/permeabilization. typical results obtained with the anti-kir <dig>   antibody are shown in fig  <dig>  in general, we found methanol fixation to preserve membrane staining but to cause a loss of intracellular fluorescence . paraformaldehyde fixation, in contrast, better preserved staining of intracellular structures . the two-step fixation protocol in general gave similar results to paraformaldehyde fixation, but the fluorescence intensity was generally much higher and more clearly defined . this may be due to better preservation of protein antigenicity and/or improved permeabilization . our data are consistent with a recent report describing the two-step protocol to better preserve the in-vivo subcellular localization of proteins  <cit> . we consequently used the two-step protocol for all subsequent experiments to examine the subcellular localization of katp channel subunits.

the subcellular distribution of kir <dig>  and kir <dig>  subunits in isolated mouse ventricular myocytes is shown in fig 7a. kir <dig>  subunits are expressed in a regular striated pattern throughout the myocyte . kir <dig>  subunits showed a similar expression pattern , with the exceptions that  kir <dig>  expression appears to be more punctate and  staining is more prominent at the myocardial surface. since we used antibodies developed in different species  we were able to detect both proteins in the same myocyte with little cross-reactivity of the secondary antibodies. although there is some degree of overlap in the subcellular expression of kir <dig>  and kir <dig>  subunits , it is apparent that there are areas within the cell that express kir <dig>  but not kir <dig>  subunits. thus, the possibility exists that these subunits may have different functional roles within the ventricular myocyte. similarly, sur <dig> and sur <dig> subunits also have distinct subcellular localizations. we consistently observed strong surface staining with sur <dig> antibodies  whereas sur <dig> antibodies diffusely stain throughout the width of the cell in a sarcomeric repeating pattern . to address the question whether there is co-localization of any of the katp channel subunits with mitochondria, we used mitotracker red as a mitochondrial marker. we found mitotracker staining to dissipate during immunocytochemistry protocols and co-labeling with katp channel antibodies was therefore not an effective strategy. nevertheless, the pattern of mitotracker staining that we observed shortly after fixation  was inconsistent with predominant subcellular distribution of any of the katp channel subunits and we conclude therefore that katp channel subunits are not abundantly expressed in cardiac mitochondria.

experiments were designed closer to examine the subcellular expression of sur <dig> subunits relative to kir <dig> pore-forming subunits . there was a remarkable degree of co-localization of sur <dig> subunits with kir <dig>  subunits  but not with kir <dig>  subunits .

we finally examined the subcellular expression patterns of katp channel subunits in another species. we chose rat ventricular myocytes for this purpose. we essentially obtained the same results as with mouse myocytes. using different antibodies against kir <dig>   we observed strong surface expression of this subunit with a smaller degree of intracellular labeling . sur <dig> antibodies also strongly labeled the cell surface . in contrast, kir <dig>  and sur <dig> antibodies both labeled repetitive patterns at sarcomeric distances . furthermore, there is strong co-localization of kir <dig>  and sur <dig> subunits in ventricular myocytes .

discussion
antibodies used in this study
a significant strength of our study is that we extensively characterized the antibodies used. we performed western blotting with membrane fractions obtained from the heart to ensure that a band of the expected size is detected. further, we chose antibodies that showed little cross-reactivity with other proteins, as judged by the absence of non-specific bands. in as far as it was possible we used different antibodies to the same katp channel subunits in immunostaining experiments to ensure that the same cellular and subcellular distribution staining patterns occurred. although not shown, we always performed negative controls to ensure that no staining was observed when the primary antibodies were omitted  or that staining could be blocked by preincubation of antibody with the peptide to which the antibody has been raised. further, we used the primary antibodies at the lowest concentrations possible to eliminate possible non-specific cross-reactivity with other proteins. our study is a comprehensive description of the cellular and subcellular expression patterns of katp channel subunits in the heart given our stringent criteria and the panel of antibodies available to us.

expression of kir <dig>  and sur <dig> subunits in ventricular myocytes
sarcolemmal katp channels in ventricular myocytes have been described more than two decades ago  <cit> . cardiac sarcolemmal katp channels have been described to consist of hetero-octameric complexes of kir <dig>  and sur2a subunits  <cit> . this concept was based on the similarities in the biophysical and pharmacological characteristics when comparing heterologously expressed kir <dig> /sur2a channels with native cardiac katp channels  <cit>  and also because of the known expression of kir <dig>  and sur2a mrna and protein in the heart. our data demonstrate both kir <dig>  and sur2a subunits to be expressed in ventricular myocytes. furthermore, we find that these two subunits co-localize, which is consistent with the biochemical, functional and pharmacological data supporting the concept that they can combine to form a heteromeric channel complex  <cit> . our data are also in agreement with the finding that knockout mice deficient of kir <dig>  or sur <dig> subunits lack katp channels in the ventricular myocyte  <cit> . it is interesting that kir <dig> /sur <dig> subunits are expressed in a regular striated pattern in ventricular myocytes. furthermore, close inspection of the images shows that both kir <dig>  and sur <dig> expression is somewhat punctate. these observations are in complete agreement with previous studies describing the expression of sur <dig> isoforms in the t-tubules and sarcolemma  <cit>  and the subcellular localization of sarcolemmal katp channels as determined by functional microscopy. scanning ion conductance  microscopy data have demonstrated katp channels to be organized in small clusters and to be anchored in the z-grooves  of the sarcolemma  <cit> . collectively, these data suggest that katp channels are predominantly expressed in the t-tubular system. the implications of katp channels present in the t-tubular system are not entirely clear. since t-tubular ion channels may control action potential propagation into the cardiac myocyte, it may be possible for katp channels to have a role in the spread of excitation and action potential duration, particularly during conditions of metabolic impairment when these channels are more prone to opening. a shorter action potential duration in the t-tubular system would imply less ca2+ entry at the local control sites of sr ca2+ release and hence reduced contractility, which may in part explain the negative inotropic effects observed with katp channel openers  <cit> . however, the picture may be more complex since both kir <dig>  and sur <dig> subunits are also expressed in ventricular myocytes.

expression of kir <dig>  and sur <dig> subunits in ventricular myocytes
we found clear expression of kir <dig>  and sur <dig> subunits in cardiac ventricular myocytes. interestingly, both of these two subunits are strongly expressed at the sarcolemmal surface, but their functions in the sarcolemma are currently not understood. since ventricular katp channels can be recorded in hearts from knockout mice lacking kir <dig>  subunits  <cit> , it appears that kir <dig>  subunits are not an absolute requirement for the formation of functional ventricular katp channels. it may be possible for kir <dig>  subunits to have a role in the pathophysiological setting, as demonstrated by the upregulated kir <dig>  expression levels during cardiac remodeling after ischemia or hypoxia  <cit> . to our knowledge, cardiac katp channels have not been studied in sur-/- mice. however, sur <dig> antisense oligonucleotides inhibit katp channels in rat ventricular myocytes  <cit> , suggesting a functional role for these subunits in ventricular sarcolemmal katp channel function. our data, demonstrating that both kir <dig>  and sur <dig> subunits exhibit strong sarcolemmal expression, may require a reassessment of the molecular composition of ventricular katp channels during normal and pathophysiological conditions.

expression of kir <dig> and sur subunits in mitochondria
the concept has evolved that katp channels are expressed in the mitochondrial inner membrane and that these channels are involved in the protection of the heart afforded by ischemic preconditioning  <cit> . the molecular nature of mito-katp channels remains to be identified. there are almost as many reports describing the presence of kir <dig>  subunits in cardiac mitochondria  <cit> . as there are denouncing their existence in these organelles  <cit> . we did not observe strong localization of katp channel subunits in ventricular mitochondria. however, the technique of immunocytochemistry does not have sufficient resolution to rule out the existence of katp channel subunits in mitochondria and our data therefore do not add significantly to this debate, other than demonstrating that katp channel subunits are not abundantly expressed in mitochondria of ventricular myocytes.

expression of katp channel subunits in the coronary smooth muscle
a tight coupling exists between metabolic status in the heart and coronary blood flow. katp channels have been identified in several different vascular tissues, including the coronary vasculature  <cit> . katp channels in coronary resistance vessels have also been implicated in physiologically important stimuli such as regulation of basal vascular tone, autoregulation of blood flow, hypoxia-induced coronary vasodilation, reactive hyperemia  and ischemia .

molecularly, the identity of coronary smooth muscle katp channels has been characterized less extensively than the katp channels in cardiomyocytes. a recent study employing in situ hybridization histochemistry examined kir <dig>  and sur2b mrna expression in different vascular beds, including the coronary vasculature  <cit> . strong mrna expression of these two subunits was found in coronary resistance arteries. interestingly, kir <dig> /sur2b expression was not found in coronary veins or venules. we found expression of kir <dig>  and sur2b protein in primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells and cryosections of human ventricle  <cit> . the present study is the first systematic and comparative characterization of katp channel subunit expression in the intact coronary vasculature. we find kir <dig>  expression in blood vessels of different sizes, including large vessels such as the aorta and large arteries, but also in small resistance arterioles . without using specific markers, we were not able to distinguish objectively between venules and arterioles, but we did occasionally observe vessels with a thin smooth muscle layer  that only expressed kir <dig>  faintly . collectively, our data using various anti-kir <dig>  antibodies generally suggest that kir <dig>  subunits are expressed in coronary arterial smooth muscle, and possibly to a lesser extent in coronary veins. in contrast, we did not observe any staining of the coronary smooth muscle with anti-kir <dig>  antibodies.

we found strong staining of smaller coronary resistance vessels with the anti-sur <dig> antibodies. we did not have access to suitable sur <dig> isoform-specific antibodies, but the staining most probably reflects sur2b expression. curiously, we failed to see strong sur <dig> expression in larger coronary arteries. this result is in apparent contradiction to the description that sur2b mrna expression occurs in larger coronaries  <cit>  and the lack of katp channels in the aortic cells of the sur <dig> knockout mouse  <cit> . reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, but may relate to the lack of sensitivity of the anti-sur <dig> antibodies used, thus underestimating sur <dig> protein expression in other structures. we did not observe sur <dig> protein expression in the coronary smooth muscle. our data are therefore in full support of the notion that katp channels in coronary artery smooth muscle  are comprised of kir <dig> /sur <dig> subunits .

expression of katp channel subunits in the coronary endothelium
the evidence that endothelial katp channels play a role in regulation of coronary blood flow is compelling. endothelial katp channels, for example, contribute to shear stress-induced endothelial release of the vasodilator nitric oxide in rabbit aorta  <cit>  and may also mediate vasodilation in response to hyperosmolarity or acidosis in the coronary microvasculature  <cit> . furthermore, the powerful vasodilatory effect of adenosine may also be mediated  by endothelial katp channels by stimulating the release of nitric oxide from the endothelium  <cit> .

in the present study, we used immunohistochemistry approaches and identified kir <dig> , kir <dig>  and sur <dig> protein in the endothelium lining coronary vessels  as well as in coronary capillary endothelium . our data are supported by previous studies. using rt-pcr techniques, it has been established that guinea pig coronary endothelial cells express kir <dig> , kir <dig>  and sur2b subunits  <cit> . the presence of kir <dig>  and sur2b mrna also detected in the coronary endothelium using in situ hybridization histochemistry techniques  <cit> . recently, using a combination of rt-pcr and western blotting techniques, we also identified kir <dig> , kir <dig>  and sur2b mrna and protein expression in primary human coronary artery endothelial cells  <cit> . importantly, in the latter study we used co-immunoprecipitation approaches to demonstrate that native human coronary endothelial katp channels are heteromeric kir <dig> /kir <dig>  complexes in combination with sur2b subunits  <cit> . thus, the biophysical nature, modes of regulation and functional consequences of these heteromeric katp channels in the endothelium may differ fundamentally from homomeric katp channels found in other tissues. the investigation of endothelial katp channels is currently the subject of some of our ongoing studies.

reservations
for this type of study, the specificity of antibodies used is always a concern. to overcome this problem, we used multiple different antibodies where possible and obtained similar staining patterns. however, we only had access to a single antibody to each of the sur subunits and consequently we have not been able to verify the specificity of these antibodies by comparing different antibodies to each other . furthermore, we did not have access to antibodies to the various splice variants of sur <dig> or sur <dig> and our data therefore do not address the possibility of regional expression differences. a definitive study will require the use of tissues obtained from knockout animals . viable knockout animals for each of the proteins under consideration have been generated, but we have not been able to obtain these animals  for this purpose. therefore, although we have taken every step possible to minimize non-specificity issues, our results should be interpreted within this limitation.

CONCLUSIONS
our study is a comprehensive analysis of the various katp channel subunits in the heart. we found each of the katp channel subunits to be expressed in ventricular myocytes, but with varying expression patterns. the roles of kir <dig>  and sur <dig> subunits in ventricular myocytes remain to be elucidated and may require a reassessment of the molecular nature of the cardiac katp channel. coronary smooth muscle expresses predominantly kir <dig>  and sur <dig> subunits, whereas the coronary endothelium expresses kir <dig> , kir <dig>  and sur <dig> subunits. thus, there is wide diversity of katp channel subunit expression within the heart which determines the functional responses of various cell types to physiological and pathophysiological demands.
