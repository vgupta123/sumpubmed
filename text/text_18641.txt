BACKGROUND
group i introns are distinguished by a conserved secondary structure fold of approximately ten paired elements and the ability to catalyze a two-step splicing reaction in which the intron rna is removed from the precursor rna transcript  <cit> . because of their ability to self-splice, group i  introns are referred to as autocatalytic rnas. the majority of group i introns are found in nuclear rrna genes and in the plastid and/or mitochondrial genomes of fungi and protists  <cit> . a smaller number of these intervening sequences are found in phage, viral, and bacterial genomes. in bacteria, group i introns interrupt four different trna genes  <cit> , the reca and nrde genes of bacillus anthracis  <cit> , the tmrna gene of clostridium botulinum  <cit> , the thya gene of bacillus mojavensis  <cit> , the rir gene of nostoc punctiforme  <cit> , and the large subunit  rrna genes of coxiella burnetii  <cit> , simkania negevensis  <cit> , several closely related thermotoga species  <cit> , and the cyanobacterium thermosynechoccus elongatus   <cit> . group i introns have not yet been found in archaea.

in eukaryotes, group i introns are common in protists except the excavates  <cit> . these sequences are particularly abundant in fungi, algae, and true slime molds. the widespread, but highly biased distribution of group i introns  suggests they have been transferred horizontally among taxa, and come to reside in different genes. interestingly, group i introns are sometimes associated with homing endonuclease genes  that can invade group i introns to promote efficient spread of the intron/heg into homologous intron-less alleles . briefly, the heg is expressed and intron/heg mobility is initiated when the site-specific homing endonuclease  generates a double-stranded dna break at or near the site of insertion in an intron-less allele, soon after mating between intron-containing and intron-lacking organisms . hegs that are associated with group i introns are categorized into five families by the presence of conserved sequence motifs xk  <cit> ) in the he proteins.

it is currently believed that most intron/heg elements follow a recurrent gain and loss life-cycle  <cit> . in this model, a mobile intron/heg invades by homing an intron-minus population until it becomes fixed at a single genic site. after fixation, the heg degenerates and is lost because it no longer confers a biological function. without the heg, the intron is lost. once the population is intron-minus the same intron/heg element  may re-invade the same genic site. however, the evolutionary outcome may be different if the heg or the intron gains a function other than endonuclease or splicing activity, respectively. in a few cases, intron-encoded proteins with dual roles have been reported. for example, in addition to functioning as homing endonucleases, i-tevi, encoded within the td intron of phage t <dig> acts as a transcriptional autorepressor  <cit> , and i-anii, a laglidadg heg encoded within a group i intron interrupting the apocytochrome b gene of aspergillus, function as a maturase  <cit> . by gaining new biological roles the heg and/or the intron can avoid becoming redundant and lost .

here we report multiple group i introns in rrna genes of cyanobacterial strains assigned to the genus synechococcus. a common feature of these introns is the presence of laglidadg homing endonuclease genes in peripheral stem-loop regions of the group i ribozyme. to our knowledge, this is the first discovery of multiple group i introns in a single chromosomal gene of a bacterium . we analyze the structure of these newly discovered introns and investigate their phylogenetic history in the context of related introns from bacteria and organelles. in addition, we present a compilation of known group i introns in bacterial or phage genomes that encode hegs.

RESULTS
group i introns with laglidadg hegs in the lsu rdna genes of synechococcus strains
in an unpublished study on cyanobacterial phylogeny, we sequenced the lsu rrna gene from  <dig> diverse cyanobacteria. to our surprise, we found introns in two of the lsu genes, from synechococcus lividus strain c <dig> and synechococcus sp. c <dig>  both originally isolated from a hot spring habitat in yellowstone national park, wyoming, usa . the lsu rrna gene of synechococcus sp. c <dig> contains three group i introns, located at positions l <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig> , whereas the s. lividus strain c <dig> lsu rrna gene contains similar introns at the l <dig> and l <dig> positions. all five introns possess a full-length heg, each containing a single copy of the laglidadg motif. very few introns have been reported in rrna genes from other bacterial phyla and this is only the second report of introns in cyanobacterial rrna genes. the first was for a single group i intron  in the thermophilic cyanobacterium thermosynechococcus elongatus .

the inferred secondary structures of the intronic rnas are presented for one each of the l <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig> synechococcus introns . unusual features include open reading frames  that extend from peripheral loops into the intron core structure. for example, the l <dig> orf starts in p <dig> and continues through the group i ribozyme elements p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> before it stops in p <dig>  the double role of the orf and ribozyme core regions suggests that these nucleotides must be under strong selective pressure to maintain the catalytic rna functions and to preserve the genetic code for a functional homing endonuclease. although uncommon, similar features have been noted in other intron-heg elements . it is also noteworthy that the l <dig> and l <dig> introns are very similar to subgroup ic <dig> introns that contain a complex p <dig> region and a classical group ic <dig> intron p <dig>  but lack a p <dig> element, which often is associated with long-range tertiary interactions . the l <dig> intron has a short p <dig> region, but contains a relatively large  extension in the p <dig> region  and a short p <dig>  the p <dig>  and p <dig>  structures were also identified in the crystal structure of a group i intron from the bacteriophage twort, where it was shown that they are part of peripheral structures that encircle and stabilize the guanosine-binding pocket  <cit> . introns lacking the p <dig> element are common in organelles, and typically belong to the ic <dig>  ia <dig> or ib <dig> subclasses of group i introns.

compilation of group i introns with hegs in bacteria and phage
at last count  , approximately 3% of nuclear group i introns contained a heg. there are no systematic counts for organellar introns, but in may  <dig> the intron database of ref.  <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> introns in rrna and protein genes, respectively, of mitochondria. of these,  <dig> contain an heg, and for  <dig> introns the presence of orfs was not determined. in plastids,  <dig> introns interrupt rdna genes and  <dig> interrupt protein genes . of these,  <dig> contain an orf and for  <dig> the presence of an orf was not determined. many of the "undetermined" entries do contain orfs  <cit> , but the exact number remains unclear. in summary, we estimate that at least  <dig> percent of organellar introns contain orfs .

to assess the frequency of hegs in bacteria and phage, we searched the literature to determine the total number of published group i introns with hegs in their genomes. the results of this analysis are summarized in table  <dig> and show that the majority of hegs in bacterial chromosomes belong to the laglidadg family and are found in group i introns located in lsu rrna genes. two members of the giy-yig family are found, in the chromosomal thya gene  of bacillus mojavensis and in the nrde gene of a prophage of bacillus anthracis and other bacillus species . one catalytically active homing endonuclease , encoded by a group i intron that interrupts the trna-fmet gene in the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> , was recently identified as the first representative of the pd-xk family of homing endonucleases  <cit> . the total number of known group i introns in chromosomal dna of bacteria  is currently around  <dig> if homologous introns in strains of the same species are regarded as one entry . therefore, more than 1/ <dig>  of known group i introns in bacteria contain hegs. finally, the  <dig> phage hegs belong exclusively to the giy-yig or hnh families. the three giy-yig hegs are found in escherichia coli phage t <dig> and in bacillus subtilis phage β <dig>  whereas the eleven hnh hegs are found in a wide variety of phage. our study did not involve comprehensive searches of genome databases, but is rather a compilation of known group i introns and hegs in bacteria. for example, in a recent paper  <cit>  many hnh heg-like sequences were identified in bacterial and phage genomes, but how many of these are associated with group i introns is unclear. it is likely that more intron/heg elements remain to be identified in genbank. his-cys box hegs are found exclusively in nuclear introns and are not included in our compilation.

phylogenetic analysis of heg-containing group i introns in bacterial rrna genes
the two unicellular, thermophilic cyanobacterial strains, synechococcus lividus strain c <dig> and synechococcus sp. c <dig>  are distant relatives based on phylogenetic analyses of small  <cit>  and large subunit rrna sequences . we added all five synechococcus intron dna and he protein sequences to previously published sequence alignments that contain homologous lsu intron/hes  <cit>  and inferred phylogenetic relationships among the sequences in these two alignments. hegs and introns that are inserted at the same rdna positions are, in general, most closely related to one another  <cit> . our inferred phylogenetic trees indicate that the synechococcus introns and their hegs form a cluster with all other known introns or hes from the same rdna insertion sites .

each of the four, rdna-positionally-distinct clades of introns/hegs contains a broad mixture of sequences from bacteria, chloroplasts , and mitochondria  . these patterns and, crucially, the very restricted and sporadic phylogenetic distribution of these introns  are consistent with the hypothesis that these introns have been frequently transferred horizontally among and within organelles and bacteria. at the same time, however, because phylogenetic resolution is generally poorly supported within each intron clade , it is unclear as to how many horizontal transfer events may have been involved in the history of the analyzed introns, much less which clades might have served as donors and/or recipients in any particular horizontal transfer event. greatly increasing the sampling of these intron families should help address these issues. however, the short length and therefore limited information content of the introns and hegs will perhaps provide severe constraints on our ability to ever recover a robustly supported phylogenetic history of these mobile genetic elements.

against this hazy backdrop of likely extensive, but poorly resolved, horizontal transfer it is possible to identify a few lineages of introns/hes where an element seems to have been transmitted by standard vertical descent once acquired by putative horizontal transfer. most relevant to this study, the s. lividus strain c <dig> l <dig> intron and he are sister to the thermosynechococcus elongatus l <dig> intron/he, whereas the l <dig> intron and he from synechococcus sp. c <dig> are sister to this pair of sequences. this evolutionary relationship is in agreement with the inferred rdna phylogeny , and therefore also with inferred organismal phylogeny. this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that this intron was acquired only once among cyanobacteria and was subsequently subject to strictly vertical transmission. the well-supported sister-group relationship of the l <dig> intron and he from s. lividus strain c <dig> and synechococcus sp. c <dig> is also in accord with the hypothesis of vertical transmission within cyanobacteria following initial acquisition of the intron via horizontal transfer. in both cases, however, sampling of many additional cyanobacteria, especially those likely to belong to the intron-containing "clades", is needed to better assess the evolutionary history of these introns. nesbø and doolittle  <cit>  have likewise concluded that following its putative acquisition from an organellar source, the l <dig> intron was subject to strictly vertical descent within a clade of nine intron-containing species and strains of thermotoga . finally, the well supported  pairing of l <dig> hes from plastid genomes of two chlamydomonads is also consistent with vertical intron descent in this lineage.

distribution of single-motif laglidadg hegs
group i introns with single-motif laglidadg hegs are found in biogeographically and phylogenetically distantly related organisms. for example, l <dig> introns with single-motif, relatively conserved  hegs are present in 1) simkania negevensis found as a contaminant in a cell culture in israel  <cit> , 2) the thermophilic bacterium thermotoga neapolitana from submarine hot springs in the bay of naples, italy  <cit> , 3) thermotoga naphthophila from the kubiki oil reservoir in japan  <cit> , 4) the cyanobacterium synechococcus spp. from a hot spring habitat in yellowstone national park, usa  <cit> , 5) mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of a diverse array of green algae, and 6) the mitochondrial genome of the amoeba acanthamoeba castellanii. yet the biological connections  among these organisms and the mode of group i intron transmission remain unclear. simkania negevensis is capable of growing and persisting in acanthamoebal cells  <cit> , indicating a potential association between these two organisms that harbor l <dig> introns.

intron/hegs are relatively widespread but very sporadically distributed in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. according to the cyclic model for gain and loss of this type of selfish intron  <cit> , the intron/heg is destined for degradation and loss after a population has been fixed for the intron. however, the intron/heg can continue to persist by repeatedly spreading into new populations or species via horizontal transfer. the enormous number of prokaryotes on our planet  and their presence in virtually every environment compatible with life may provide a constant source of intron-less populations that the intron/hegs can potentially invade.

given high rates of horizontal transfer in prokaryotes , it is surprising that only a small number of introns have been found in their rdna genes. as of  <dig> december  <dig>   <dig> prokaryote genomes have been sequenced and another  <dig> are in progress  <cit> . in addition, a search of the genbank nucleotide sequence database  <cit>  limited to nearly complete rrna gene sequences of known prokaryote origin  returned  <dig>  records for small subunit rrna , and  <dig> records for large subunit rrna . even though these numbers overestimate the complete number of prokaryote rrna gene sequences in genbank, they provide a rough estimate of how rare rdna introns are in prokaryotes. it is therefore surprising to find three group i introns with hegs in a single rdna gene . it is unclear why synechococcus sp. c <dig> contains three introns and s. lividus strain c <dig> contains two, whereas the vast majority of bacteria contain no rdna introns and the few others that have any introns possess only one.

one possible explanation is that the life history and/or physiology of this cyanobacterial group promote intron transfer. alternatively, introns may sometimes serve a role in the host cell and therefore accumulate in these lineages. whatever the reason, once inserted into rdna, introns could pose a risk for bacteria because they could potentially interfere with posttranscriptional processing of precursor rrna transcripts. although not fully understood, this processing is relatively complex in bacteria . in addition, group i ribozymes catalyze side reactions other than self-splicing, reactions that result in intron rna circles and fragmented rrnas  <cit> . some rdna operons and primary transcripts contain many group i introns , which makes it increasingly important to strictly regulate group i ribozyme activity towards splicing and not circle formation.

CONCLUSIONS
we found multiple heg-containing group i introns in cyanobacterial lsu rrna genes. specifically, the lsu rrna gene of synechococcus sp. c <dig> contains three group i introns, at positions l <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig>  whereas the s. lividus strain c <dig> lsu rrna gene contains similar introns at l <dig> and l <dig>  this finding is surprising because the vast majority of bacteria contain no rdna introns and the few others that have any introns possess only one. the intron-encoded hegs belong to the laglidadg family, and contain one copy each of the conserved amino acid motif that defines this family . phylogenetic analyses show that the cyanobacterial introns and their hegs are closely related to introns and hegs located at homologous insertion sites in organellar and bacterial rdna genes. finally, from previous studies it is estimated that approximately 3% of nuclear group i introns contain hegs. in our survey of group i introns and hegs in the literature we estimate that at least half of organellar group i introns contain hegs, and that about one third of bacterial group i introns contain hegs.
