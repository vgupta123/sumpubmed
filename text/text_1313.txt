BACKGROUND
cyclic nucleotide signaling is the main inhibitory pathway in platelets in vivo that balances platelet activation. the complex regulation of this pathway includes endothelium released factors activating platelet nucleotide cyclases and in consequence cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases that in turn phosphorylate major components of the platelet activation pathways thus preventing platelet aggregation  <cit> . platelet phosphodiesterases  counterbalance the action of nucleotide cyclases  <cit> . regulators of camp levels are of strong pharmacological interest and have clinical and therapeutic implications  <cit> .

computational modeling can advance understanding of cellular signaling in thrombosis and hemostasis and elucidates furthermore the fine-tuned camp signaling in platelets. great effort has been devoted to model endothelial layer maintenance and senescence  <cit>  as well as thrombus development  <cit> . here we model time-resolved cyclic nucleotide pathway signaling in human platelets involving specific parameters for metabolism, regulation and different effector strengths by means of a data-based in silico modeling approach.

investigation of signaling pathways by kinetic modeling is commonly applied  <cit>  and stimulates new biological insights into the modeled system. combined with statistical validation based on experimental data, dynamic models can serve as a platform for testing hypotheses e.g. on pharmacological interventions on the system. furthermore, the predictive features of kinetic models allow leading and directing biochemical experiments and elicit novel and unexpected biological findings.

here we present a first kinetic model on platelet signaling including time-resolved interplay and downstream effects of cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways .

in the following, our quantitative dynamic model, based on a system of ordinary differential equations  is set up according to our philosophy : using a data-driven modeling approach, it enables us to correctly model the behavior of measured pathway components over time as well as to test the effects of drug combinations. it estimates individual effects of pde-specific inhibitors and activators of adenylyl cyclase  at different strengths and combinations and allows the prediction of feedback loops. we investigate camp accumulation after stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by iloprost and forskolin as well as the effects of inhibition of camp degrading pdes by cilostamide or milrinone using individual concentration parameters for each platelet pde isoform . the reliability of the model is tested and validated with experimental data of human platelets. it allows the prediction of effects of platelet inhibiting drugs and drug combinations on platelet camp pathway taking drug interactions, time-scales and regulatory loops into account.

RESULTS
modeling approach
although the main players of inhibitory signal transduction in human platelets are well investigated, their interplay is still not fully understood. since platelet inhibition and its up- and downstream signaling events influence this fine-tuned balance around platelet activation and quiescence, we here focus on a pharmacological motivated modeling approach, driven by data-based model validation.

our modeling approach is as follows: to model the basal levels of platelet camp and cgmp we first established a dynamic in silico model based on a set of ordinary differential equations, comprising prior knowledge of specific kinetic constants and concentrations of the signaling components . we then performed experimental measurements of human platelets stimulating the system with various doses of pde inhibitors and ac activators. all collected data were used to fit the model parameters , iteratively expanding and improving the ab initio model and its predictions by means of experimental data and statistical model testing . this allowed us to differentiate between competing models . hypothesis testing and data-based model selection lead to the most parsimonious but reasonable model which was finally used to predict the effects for novel drug combinations as well as downstream-signaling events . these predictions again lead to the design of new experiments to validate the predictive model. the modeling and model validation itself was conducted within several modeling phases , focusing on the goodness of fit regarding the model refinement processes.

set-up of a basal model of unstimulated platelets
we developed a dynamic model reflecting the major cyclic nucleotide pathway topology as illustrated in figure  <dig> and specified in the appendix. it integrates information about enzyme isoforms in platelets, gathered from a previously established proteome and transcriptome database of the human platelet  <cit>  and literature mining: in the resting  platelet, adenylyl and guanylyl cyclase  and the three major phosphodiesterases pde <dig>  pde <dig> and pde <dig> together maintain basal camp and cgmp levels of  <dig> μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively  <cit> . all known pivotal pdes expressed in platelets were included: pde2a , pde3a  and pde5a  and their respective enzymatic activity was modeled by michaelis menten kinetics as detailed in  <cit> . in particular, camp shows positively cooperative kinetic effects, resulting in a hill coefficient of  <dig> with respect to pde <dig> catalysis  <cit> . moreover, pde <dig> is modeled as a cgmp stimulated homodimer resulting in increased activity at physiological concentrations , while vmax remains unchanged  <cit> . primarily, camp degradation is provided by pde <dig> , regulating basal camp levels  <cit> . because of its cgmp specificity, pde <dig> is included in the basal model but plays only a minor role under basal conditions and is insignificant for camp regulation. under basal conditions , we assumed an overall ac activity in platelets to  <dig> ±  <dig> μm/min according to data reported in literature  <cit> . this leads to the parsimonious but reasonable network structure of the resting state .

model and experimental data indicate low effective pde concentrations in resting human platelets
the central components of the platelet cyclic nucleotide pathways are the pdes. although, data on enzyme kinetics for many isoforms  are available, no data on enzyme concentration in human platelets for any isoform are currently accessible. therefore, we measured intracellular concentrations of the major phosphodiesterases in human platelets. after calibration with recombinant expressed pdes by western blot this yields concentrations of  <dig>  mg/l  for pde <dig>   <dig> mg/l  for pde <dig> and  <dig> mg/l  for pde <dig>  total molar concentrations are calculated based on a platelet volume of  <dig>  fl as reported in  <cit> .

using the experimentally determined pde concentrations and assuming that 80% of total camp turnover is provided by pde <dig> activity  <cit>  simulations from the basic model of the unstimulated platelet indicate that basal cyclic nucleotide levels cannot be maintained with these levels of active pdes but are rapidly diminished . in fact, mathematical calculations yielded a camp hydrolysis activity of  <dig>  μm/min for the pde <dig> isoform  as well as  <dig>  μm/min for pde <dig> . this would give total camp hydrolysis rate of  <dig>  mm/min corresponding to a turnover rate of the entire platelet camp pool of  <dig> times per minute. these results suggest that not the entire amount of pde is enzymatically active but rather the majority of the enzyme remains inactive in resting platelets. parameter optimization constraining on a constant basal camp level of  <dig> μm yielded an enzymatically active pde concentration of  <dig>  mg/l for pde <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/l for pde <dig> , respectively. this precisely reproduced cyclic nucleotide levels under resting conditions . consequently, this predicts an in vivo activity of  <dig>  μm/min for pde <dig> and of  <dig>  μm/min for pde <dig>  yielding a total camp hydrolysis activity of  <dig> μm/min. this agrees with apparently low available concentrations suggested by electron microscopy , though high total pde concentrations were measured in vitro. the low active concentration for the antibody stain may be due to e.g. enzyme sequestration or inactivation in a complex   <cit> . thus, either substantial amounts of camp degrading pdes are not catalytically active and/or the in vivo enzyme activity is significantly lower than under in vitro conditions. furthermore, there is experimental evidence indicating the compartmentalization of pde <dig> and pde <dig>  <cit> . to incorporate all experimental findings, we thus extended the model to include equilibrium between an active or inactive pde form .

model validation using experimental time series data from camp elevating compounds
after the development of the basal model of cyclic nucleotide signaling under resting conditions, we experimentally analyzed and modeled pathway effects of drugs causing elevated cyclic nucleotide levels in platelets thus inhibiting platelet aggregation .

we here focus on the camp pathway, probing varying drug doses of pde inhibitors and stimulators of ac: the inhibition of pde <dig> by milrinone  or cilostamide  resulted in a delayed increase in camp concentration , whereas milrinone exerted a larger effect resulting in higher camp levels compared to those induced by treatment with comparable doses of cilostamide. stimulation of the prostacyclin receptor by iloprost  or allosteric activation of acs by forskolin  evoked an immediate and pronounced camp increase . dosage-dependent stimulation by the stable prostacyclin analog iloprost led to elevated camp plateaus with saturation beyond the administration of  <dig> nm iloprost . similarly, stimulation by diterpene forskolin  achieved high camp concentrations and a plateau  after five minutes . for each time point and drug dosage, three independent camp measurements were quantified.

model selection: multi-experiment fitting and testing hypotheses on camp feedback loops
to incorporate all experimental findings, we iteratively expanded and refined the established basal model by fitting the resulting models reflecting pde inhibition and ac stimulation simultaneously to all collected data sets:

we therefore modified the enzymatic catalysis  by incorporating the kinetics for competitive inhibition  as reported in  <cit>  resulting in the observed michaelis-menten-like reaction rate

  υ=vmax⋅c⋅c <dig> +uiki⋅km+c. 

here, ui represents the concentration of the inhibitor , whereas ki denotes the respective inhibition constant. these drug-specific constants adjust the apparent km-value of the competitively inhibited enzyme.

to model ac activation, we introduce additional rates

  υ=xforskolin,υ=xiloprost 

respectively, mimicking the increased camp formation by ac . this rate has been estimated locally for each concentration of the ac activators forskolin and iloprost.

we conducted and evaluated fit sequences by slightly disturbing all model parameters before again adapting the model to time series data. we chose fitting ranges of unknown parameters  according to mean values derived from literature if available  or selected a broad range in effect not limiting the parameter space during fitting . multi-experiment fitting sequences provided us with χ <dig> values, indicating the quality of model fits . this reveals that the adapted model, according to equations  and , could not explain all experimental data. addressing this discrepancy, we considered two possibilities to further expand and refine the model: feedback regulation of the camp level is known to be mediated through activation of pde <dig> and inhibition of ac, which both have been experimentally observed  <cit> . the mechanism of pde <dig> activation is also indicated by possible pde <dig> phosphorylation at ser <dig>  a pka phosphorylation site, as reported in plateletweb  <cit> .

competing hypotheses: h <dig> - no integrated assumption of feedback loops; h <dig> - positive feedback of camp-dependent pka to pde <dig> ; h <dig> - negative feedback of elevated camp levels to ac ; h <dig> - both assumptions  are integrated within the mathematical model . for each evaluated hypotheses the resulting χ <dig> -value, number of data points , number of estimated model parameters  and the akaike information criterion  are listed.

therefore, we modified the underlying model equations  and  by introducing a camp-dependent increase of vmax

  vmaxnew=vmax+kf1⋅c. 

factor kf <dig> thereby weights the camp feedback resulting in an activation of pde <dig> 

analogous, we added a camp-dependent term mimicking ac inhibition in rate equations  for i = forskolin and iloprost, respectively:

  υnew=xi-kf2⋅c. 

feedback constant kf <dig> adjusts the strength of this negative feedback loop.

we investigated by likelihood ratio tests for competing nested pairs of models  <cit>  whether both model refinements are statistically necessary to expand the model structure. table  <dig> shows the resulting p-values for testing hypotheses on both feedback loops. we tested either positive feedback of camp-dependent pka on pde <dig> activity , negative feedback of pka inhibiting ac activity  or both feedback loops simultaneously  against the null hypothesis that the parameter  with regard to each feedback loop equals zero . albeit, assuming one feedback solely  enhanced the overall model fit , it failed in explaining all time series simultaneously. for a given level of significance of  <dig> , likelihood ratio tests of nested models evidenced a significantly better fit to the data by including both  the inhibition of ac, as well as  the camp-dependent activation of pde <dig> by pka . hence, the inclusion of both feedback constants statistically led to the most reasonable model structure. modeled accordingly, this resulted in model trajectories explaining all data simultaneously . the trajectories do not differ significantly from the experimental data  by estimating a small set of  <dig> specific parameters . this modeling approach considers the full set of time series data resulting from pde inhibition and ac stimulation experiments at varying drug dose ranges, allowing for hypotheses testing of inherent feedback loops.

four competing hypotheses on feedback loop integration  are tested with regard to the given level of significance . for each scenario, the appropriate likelihood ratio test for nested model pairs was conducted . this reveals that the integration of both additional feedback constants is statistically relevant to explain all time series data on camp elevating drugs.

the validated in silico model reflects processes of platelet activation and models correctly the experimental measurements by considering low effective pde concentrations, activation of pde <dig> by pka at increased camp levels as well as the negative feedback loop of camp-dependent pka inhibiting ac activity.

parameter sensitivity
we analyzed several characteristics of the platelet camp signal, indicating the state of inhibition, to investigate the influence of model parameters on this inhibitory signal. results exemplified for one pde <dig> inhibitor  and one ac stimulator  indicate that in case of pde <dig> inhibition , the camp signal is mainly controlled by the basal formation of camp. the impact of drug-specific and pde-specific constants augments with the increase of the inhibitory drug dose. a similar sensitivity profile for parameters can be observed for low-dose ac stimulation  whereas at high doses, particularly the feedback constant kf <dig>  gains importance and outweighs the influence of basal camp formation . this corroborates the pivotal role of feedback regulation of the cyclic nucleotide level in platelets.

to highlight the effect of the feedback constants kf <dig> ) and kf <dig> ) on the model predictions for camp signal, constants were perturbed . constant kf <dig>  resulted in camp signal spans ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μm , however, this range expanded up to  <dig> μm . the camp signal is highly sensitive to ac feedback inhibition  even at low concentration  of iloprost . this is also reflected in the model selection procedure  again indicating a subtle feedback regulation of camp levels.

combination effects of different drugs
having established a validated dynamic model on the basis of time series data of four different anti-platelet drugs at varying concentrations, we can use this model to predict and to study drug combination effects in detail. here we investigate the effects of simultaneous applications of pde <dig> inhibitors  and ac activators . in particular, we analyze the combined effect of iloprost and cilostamide by measuring experimentally the response to each drug individually  as well as the effect of combinations of all drug doses on the camp level . the experimentally measured camp plateaus for each drug combination are depicted in figure 5c . this clearly reveals an over-additive effect of the two drugs when applied in combinations. based on this, we predict camp levels of other drug combinations , illustrating the capabilities of the full model: simultaneous stimulation of ac and inhibition of pde <dig> is modeled by combining iloprost  and milrinone  or cilostamide, respectively . the surface of camp level results from interpolating the reached camp plateaus  at the respective drug combination; the origin marks the basal camp level, each axis indicates the effect of the single drugs.

as synergistic effects of pde inhibitors in combination with iloprost have been described in human platelets  <cit>  we embedded an additional camp-dependent constant k to capture this over-additive effect . in adaptation to quantitative data of experiments combining cilostamide and iloprost, we find the calculated camp level surface in close accordance to measured camp concentrations , resulting in k =  <dig>  ±  <dig> . this way, the predicted camp levels describe perfectly the subsequent experimental measurements in contrast to assuming an additive effect of drug combinations . this indicates a continuous synergistic effect of cilostamide and iloprost interaction potentiating the respective single drug stimulation .

furthermore we analyzed the combined effects of forskolin and milrinone  by predicting camp levels of combining forskolin drug doses  with milrinone doses of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm. the surface of camp level interpolates calculated camp level plateaus reached at the distinct combinations of drug. similarly, we predict camp levels for the simultaneous inhibition of ac and pde <dig>  respectively. figure 5e shows the successive decrease of elevated camp level due to milrinone  by combining this pde <dig> inhibition with several doses of an ac inhibitor . in addition, we give a summary and classification of typical platelet drugs  allowing computer based modeling of drug  effects.

pathway integration: phosphorylation of individual vasp phosphorylation sites
an important downstream effector of cyclic nucleotide signaling is vasp. this phosphoprotein has two major phosphorylation sites   <cit>  which both negatively regulate platelet aggregation. since this protein is a major target for both, pka  and pkg , it can integrate the input from these two pathways. thus, it is a paradigm for complex combination effects regarding phosphorylation events. here we consider and model the differential effect of pka on both of these sides. site ser <dig> is a 15-fold better substrate for phosphorylation by pka than the phosphosite ser <dig> being also a substrate for the cgmp-dependent protein kinase pkg  <cit> . furthermore, this differential phosphorylation of pka has to be considered for the read-out of diagnostic vasp assays  <cit> . the phosphosite-specific modeling results in a good fit to experimental measurements  and allows again predictions for different drug strengths and combinations .

cross-talk between cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways
interestingly, experimental data and model predictions evidence that the camp response in platelets is highly specific: no cross-talk to the cgmp pathway for camp stimulating compounds can be observed regarding change in cgmp levels . even at camp concentrations up to the millimolar range e.g. due to exceeding ac stimulation by forskolin  the cgmp levels remain unaffected . furthermore, pde <dig> inhibition by cilostamide  and milrinone  as well as ac stimulation  solely elevate the camp level . regarding a camp-focused pathway model based on stimulation of ac  or inhibition of camp-degrading pdes , the cgmp-specific components of the model  can thus be neglected.

probing the signaling network sensitivity
to investigate the network sensitivity, we considered different perturbations and network cross-linking: we analyzed the model performance by probing drug stimuli  of different time-scales .

the network sensitively responds to transient stimuli even at low stimuli doses . the same holds for transient prostaglandin receptor activation  <cit> . physiologically, this receptor is transiently activated by prostacyclin , produced by the endothelium. thus, in case of an injury of the vessel wall parts of the endothelium remain without the production of prostacyclin so that only an insufficient signal is invoked and the platelet lacks inhibition. similarly, patho-physiological conditions like prostacyclin receptor mutations  <cit>  contribute to a differential platelet inhibition decreasing the protection against unwanted platelet activation and aggregation. modified platelet activation is crucial for thrombus self-organization and the formation of thrombi. we showed this gradual transient platelet inhibition via different prostacyclin doses as model response  as well as experimentally, by considering camp-dependent, time-resolved phosphorylation events on vasp  .

furthermore, we showed that an elevation of platelet camp level has no effect on the cgmp pathway, however the converse cross-talk has been described  <cit>  and mainly mediated though cross-linking of the platelet phosphodiesterases. we therefore speculated on the effect of cgmp stimuli by incorporating identified pde interconnections into the model structure .

discussion
mathematical modeling of platelet signaling
ode-based dynamic models have emerged as fruitful tool for the modeling of biological systems and signaling pathways  <cit> . in particular, they allow data-based kinetic modeling and the detailed investigation of pharmacological effects on cellular signaling cascades. in general, this works best for moderate-sized networks where sufficient detailed data are available to estimate model parameters. in this sense, the cyclic nucleotide signaling pathway in human platelets is especially well-suited for such an approach as there is enough information on the kinetics available and the number of key components is rather moderate.

here, we present a mathematical model, based on existing biological knowledge and an extensive set of experimental measurements. using the powerful approach of multi-experiment fitting, we optimized the model parameters in the context of several in vitro data sets. since this provides a higher number of data points for the estimation of parameters, it permits not only the estimation of predictive model parameters but also statistically verifies the validity of a given model. moreover, this allows for discrimination between competing model hypotheses  <cit> . with this approach we could use the entire set of n =  <dig> experimental data points  to obtain reliable estimates of the basic model parameters by globally fitting them to the dataset.

pathway simulations and integration
models on thrombosis or endothelial function have been published before  <cit> , but so far none investigated the camp mediated signaling in the platelet in detail. in this study, we established a time-resolved in silico model of fine-tuned camp signaling in platelets. the data and model can serve as a basis to gain a deeper insight into the basic effects of platelet cyclic nucleotide signaling. predictions based on simulations of the basal in silico model indicate that only a very small fraction of the pdes is enzymatically active under basal conditions which might be a result of pde compartmentalization as has been reported for adipocytes , hek <dig> cells and cardiac myocytes  and platelets   <cit> .

elevated levels of cyclic nucleotides potently contribute to platelet inhibition targeting cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases that in turn phosphorylate specific substrates. via camp degrading phosphodiesterases, cgmp can regulate the level of camp in cardiac cells including platelets  <cit> . within this context, we show system state transitions from the non-activated camp pathway in platelets to an activated state as well as activatory and inhibitory cross-linking directed from the cgmp and the camp pathway . key feedback regulations involve the resting state of the platelet and the activation of both the camp pathway and cgmp pathway. interestingly, the camp pathway is highly specific: even at considerably high camp levels no cross-talk to the cgmp pathway could be observed. this is validated here including experimental measurements.

furthermore, we investigated how the two branches of cyclic nucleotide signaling in human platelets might be integrated. therefore, we focused on vasp, a prominent pka and pkg substrate and highly connected hub protein. signal integration by vasp protein relies on the activation of the downstream cytoskeletal regulating signaling cascade  <cit> . taking into account the two major known pka/pkg phosphorylation sites, ser <dig> and ser <dig>  we accurately predict and experimentally validate resulting differential activation in quantitative terms of specific pka mediated phosphorylations on vasp.

effects of drug combinations
platelets play a critical role in thrombosis and hemostasis. therefore, it is important that no accidental activation of platelets occurs and the intricate balance between activation and inhibition is maintained. this has implications for pharmacological fine-tuning of the system. various pharmacological substances affecting camp signaling in platelets are in clinical use. the most prominent mechanisms of anti-platelet drugs are the inhibition of p2y <dig> receptors , of cox <dig> and thromboxane  and of phosphodiesterases  as well as antagonistic effects on integrin αiibβ <dig>   <cit> . other drugs such as antagonists of platelet prostaglandin receptor ep <dig> for prostaglandin e <dig> targeting platelet g-protein-coupled receptors  or adenylyl cyclases as potential drug targets are under development  <cit> . furthermore, anti-platelet therapy benefits of the potential over-additive effect of platelet drugs applied in combination  <cit>  and of the investigation of drug interactions  <cit>  potentially leading to a decrease in drug dosage and undesirable side effects like bleeding. hence, a more detailed understanding of the interactions and effects of these substances on platelet activation and inhibition is not only of scientific interest but also of clinical importance. having calibrated the model with experimental data of different drugs, the final model allows predictions not only about the effect of single drugs but also about combinations thereof. a major challenge of drug interaction modeling is to account for synergistic, additive or antagonistic drug interactions  <cit> . this can be achieved by individual parameters for each specific combination of drug doses resulting in different types of interactions becoming apparent on the camp level. concerning the modeled drug interactions, we succeeded in modeling these different modes of drug interaction with just one unique camp dependent parameter. the assumed simplification led to reliable and robust predictions compatible with the observed experimental data. however, we are aware that more complex effects and different modes of action have to be introduced if a broader range of drugs is considered and larger data sets are available.

feedback regulation of camp level
moreover, the system analysis based on experiments of platelet stimulation with anti-platelet drugs points to an important role of ac and pde feedback primarily from pde <dig>  focusing on major pathway components it becomes clear that these two feedback loops are to be involved to achieve optimal signal strengths. induced by elevated camp concentration, activated pka inhibits ac but as well activates pde <dig>  <cit> . short-term feedback regulation of cyclic nucleotide concentrations resulting from activation of camp-dependent pka have been indicated in various cell types  including platelets  <cit>  showing the ubiquitous nature of this mechanism. here, we focused on the activation of pde <dig> as well as the inhibition of ac activity, both in pka-dependent manner.

the activation of pde3a and pde4a by pka has been observed in smooth muscle cells  <cit> . moreover, pde3a is phosphorylated by pka at ser <dig> in a response to forskolin  <cit>  resulting in pde3a activation in human platelets  <cit> . our model results suggest a more prominent role for ac inhibition by pka phosphorylation. this pka-dependent inhibitory effect has been described for adenylyl cyclase subtypes  <dig>  and  <dig>  in smooth muscle cells  <cit> . as platelet proteomics data indicate the expression ac <dig> and ac <dig> besides ac subtype  <dig> and  <dig> in human platelets, direct phosphorylation of ac <dig> or ac <dig> by pka might contribute to the feedback inhibition of camp synthesis  <cit> .

our data suggest that both feedback effects are crucial for regulating camp levels in human platelets where the inhibitory effect on ac outweighs the positive feedback effect on pde <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
we established a comprehensive dynamic model using multi-experiment fitting procedures, which enables us to evaluate and test questions of pharmacological interest. our in silico model integrates central camp regulating mechanisms for a comprehensive description of camp signaling in human platelets. it has been tested and successfully applied to compare synergistic and non-synergistic as well as activatory and inhibitory drug combination effects on this fine-tuned platelet signaling pathway through which signals are sensitively propagated. the inhibitory camp pathway is well balanced: our modeling approach reveals low active pde concentrations compared to those experimentally measured in the platelet as well as two feedback loops allowing highly reliable signal transmission.

high sensitivity for low effector concentrations, threshold behavior and stable platelet inhibition are resulting. perturbations such as prostacyclin receptor mutations and varying time scales of drug stimulation  are modeled as well to probe the network sensitivity. in contrast to cgmp, which is known to interact with the camp pathway  <cit> , converse cross-talk of camp to the cgmp pathway was neither predicted nor observed. however, direct integration over signals from camp and cgmp pathways is achieved via the integrator protein vasp and its phosphorylation sites, thereby also monitoring the effects of anti-platelet drugs.

future work will extend the model to cover more complex scenarios such as stimulation of gi-coupled receptors  which are known to decrease camp levels in human platelets thereby leading to platelet activation. further model development will concern the integration of cgmp pathway effects on platelet camp levels upon stimulation of gcs.

in perspective, the in silico modeling approach of platelet camp as well as cgmp regulation will support future drug development as well as strategies for anti-aggregatory treatment and provides a unique tool for experimental design of pharmacological studies of platelets.
