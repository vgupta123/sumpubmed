BACKGROUND
the genus vanilla belongs to the family orchidaceae, which consists of more than  <dig> described species  <cit> . vanilla planifolia andrews, v. tahitensis and v. pompona are the commercially important species cultivated for the production of natural vanilla flavour  <cit> . vanilla planifolia is preferred to the two other species for its flavour  <cit> .

the seeds of vanilla do not usually germinate and hence the plants are propagated by vegetative means through stem cuttings resulting in a slow rate of multiplication. moreover, this method is not economical since the collection of stem cuttings leads to the interruption of growth of the mother plant, resulting in a yield reduction which can be minimized by in vitro regeneration and mass multiplication. hence, the in vitro multiplication of v. planifolia using shoot tip and axillary buds has been frequently reported  <cit> . thus cultivated plants are genotypically identical but all could be sensitive to the aggressiveness of virulent soil pathogens  <cit> . somaclonal variation can be induced if regeneration includes callus culture  <cit> . unfortunately plantlet regeneration from callus of v. planifolia has not been reported so far  <cit> . mass production of v. planifolia through indirect shoot organogenesis is rare and there are numerous biological unknowns about the induction of this morphogenesis.

organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis are both morphogenetic processes leading to plantlet regeneration. it is postulated that control over embryogenic development occurs at the protein and metabolite levels  <cit> . proteomic approaches have been applied to investigate the protein profiles and their changes during callus differentiation  <cit>  and induction of somatic embryogenesis  <cit> . all these studies have applied the two-dimensional electrophoresis  technique which is often employed for the analysis of differential protein expression across biological samples  <cit> . moreover, proteomic approaches were achieved using both 2-de technique for protein separation and maldi-tof-tof-ms for protein identification  <cit> .

metabolomics approaches have also been applied to study white spruce somatic embryogenesis  <cit> . the ultimate goal of metabolomics is both qualitative and quantitative analysis of all metabolites in an organism or tissue  <cit> . it can provide a broad view of the biochemical status of an organism in interaction with its environment. chemical analysis techniques applied to metabolomic profiling involves nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  since nmr can provide direct molecular structure information in the analysis of complex biological mixtures such as cell growth media  <cit>  or plant extracts  <cit> .

proteomic and metabolomic analysis using nmr techniques can be considered as two complementary techniques. as such, proteomic analysis highlights changes in the more abundant proteins, including many enzymes whereas nmr analysis reveals differences in the more abundant metabolites. therefore, metabolomics will provide crucial information for a functional interpretation of proteomic data, while proteomic analysis contributes to a better understanding of metabolomic data by highlighting the enzymes or enzymatic pathways involved  <cit> . consequently, a combination of these methods represents great potential for exploring the biological processes involved in response to environmental changes such as the effect of plant hormones in culture medium. in this study, by associating proteomics and metabolomics, we have used organogenic calli from v. planifolia protocorm to investigate their metabolic and protein profiles and their changes during earlier stages of shoot differentiation. we have identified several proteins whose expression differed during early events of shoot organogenesis. in addition, some metabolites were also characterized regarding this morphogenesis and subsequent vanilla plant regeneration.

RESULTS
adventitious shoots and in vitro plant formation
in vitro germination appeared after three months in culture with highest percentages between the fourth and sixth months. however, a weak germination percentage has been observed with the formation of a massive structure originating from each seed embryo. this structure lengthened and subsequently developed into protocorm - like structure  showing an apical meristem and root primordium covered with rhizoids . the mean number of pls germination per petri dish were scored at 8%. these pls developed calli after 2- <dig> weeks of culture on the callus induction medium  which were transferred after one month on the callus maintenance medium. subculture to fresh medium was done at 21-day intervals for a period of six months. after this period, the calli were transferred to a shoot differentiation and protocorm - like body  multiplication and elongation medium  with a <dig> medium as control. these calli on a <dig> medium developed very slowly into few chlorophyllous regions between  <dig> days and  <dig> days . white nodular compact structures were also observed on calli ca <dig> d <dig> and could be considered as somatic embryos formation . nevertheless, these nodular compact structures did not become chlorophyllous. by contrast, calli cultured on medium a <dig> became green at the tips after  <dig> days. these chlorophyllic tips could be considered as shoot primordial in the form of protocorm - like body  formation which originated from the surface of callus and were often slightly translucent . when callus was more organized, the number and morphology of the plb increased resulting in well-developed shoots clearly visible on ca <dig> d <dig> calli . one or two roots were perceived on these calli beyond  <dig> days of culture . multiplication, differentiation and elongation of plbs were observed on ca <dig> d <dig> . three-cm size well developed plbs were excised and transferred onto the rooting medium   whereby roots were formed after two to three weeks.

histological verification of shoot organogenesis
in vitro plant regeneration was studied and analyzed  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after subculture of calli on either a <dig> medium  or on a <dig> medium . thus,  <dig> days after subculture, global view showed few differences between ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> calli . multiple original zones with small cells with well-defined and large nuclei  were noticed on these two types of calli and were proembryonic cells indicating the embryogenic nature of calli ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> with highly regenerative efficiency. thus, figure 2d showed four proembryonic cells surrounded by a thick wall that formed a young proembryon and may cause the formation of plb in ca <dig> d <dig> calli . the cellular structure of these two types of calli was heterogeneous with bigger vacuolated cells in the cortex region . the pink colour of some large cells in ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> calli after pas staining indicates that these cells probably accumulate soluble carbohydrates such as sucrose and/or glucose . starch grains were visible after  <dig> days in the large cells of the cortex region of these two types of calli . meristematic cells forming nodular compact structures were also detected on the peripheral region of calli ca <dig> d <dig> indicating the first step of pro-embryos development and perhaps plb formation . however, at any time, no differentiated or well-developed plb were noticed from these compact structures. apex shoot initiation was perceived in calli ca <dig> d <dig> . starch grains were seen to accumulate in the subapical regions of these shoots  whereas layers of small cells with central big nuclei and dense cytoplasm were distinguished in the apical regions. those cell layers could be at the origin of the development of tunica what could be the beginning of plb organogenesis in calli ca <dig> d <dig> . shoot differentiation was observed in calli ca <dig> d <dig> . thus, differentiated shoots or plb at early stage of development were characterized by a very noticeable leafsheath and made up of vascularized tissue composed of elongated cells . an important accumulation of polysaccharides probably starch especially at the base of newly differentiated plbs was noticed in embryogenic callus . this type of cellular differentiation was neither observed in the borders nor in the cortex regions of calli ca <dig> d <dig> which had poorly developed cellular structures recognized by their elementary vascular system . in these two regions, original stage of plb formation from multi proembryonic cells was observed in mitotic cells zone  . ca <dig> d <dig> calli were embryogenic calli with potential of organogenis like embryogenic/organogenic calli.

the nearby presence of starch could be an important factor in organogenesis of plb in ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> calli. these observations confirm that orchid seeds cannot reach the seedling stage without an external supply of carbohydrates which is provided in nature by fungi mycorrhizae.

proteomic analysis
the regeneration of plantlets via indirect shoot organogenesis on a <dig> medium was confirmed using histological techniques. no bipolar structures  could be identified. vascular connections were also detected between developing shoots and callus tissue. this is another distinct feature of shoot organogenesis. based on these results, shoot differentiation had probably started between d <dig> and d <dig> after subculture of organogenic calli onto a <dig> medium. thus, the earlier changes in protein expression profiles were analyzed by comparing the 2-de proteome of ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> calli at the stage where no differentiating part was visible in ca <dig> d <dig> calli morphology . the two 2-de images had a similar pattern of protein spots distribution. the majority of them  did not show any change. however,  <dig> protein spots with significantly different  expression levels were retained on calli cultured in two conditions . by using maldi-tof-tof-ms analysis and ms/ms database,  <dig> differentially expressed protein spots were more reliable identified. additional file  <dig> provides the swiss-prot accession numbers corresponding to protein spots shown in figure  <dig>  the putative names of proteins, the plant organism from which the protein has been identified, the number of amino acid matched, the confidence percentage , the percentage of identification, the sequence of identified peptides and the values for experimental and theoretical molecular mass. unfortunately,  <dig> protein spots  were identified with only  <dig> peptide sequence matched and  <dig> protein spots  were identified with other organisms. no homology with known peptide sequence in available protein databases was perceived for  <dig> protein spots . these  <dig> protein spots which were clearly identified represent  <dig> different proteins according to their description. these  <dig> proteins have been classified into  <dig> categories based on their potential functions . the majority of these proteins are those involved in amino acid-protein metabolism , energy pathways metabolism  and photosynthetic activity . the other proteins are those engaged in stress response . this distribution changes if we consider only proteins upregulated in ca <dig> d <dig> calli which represent  <dig> out of the  <dig> proteins identified both on ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> calli. these  <dig> proteins could also be classified with the relative percentage such that the majority was those involved in photosynthetic activity  and amino acid-protein metabolism  . however, for this novel distribution, the relative percentage of stress induced proteins increases to 17%. these proteins belong to a category of widespread proteins, chaperonin cpn  <dig> 

metabolic profiling
metabolic elucidation using one and two dimensional nmr spectroscopy
one-  and two-dimensional  nmr spectroscopy techniques are reliable methods for the analysis of a broad range of compound allowing the identification of compounds such as amino acids, carbohydrates, organic acids and phenolic compounds. 2d nmr spectroscopy, such as j-resolved, cosy  and hmbc , was applied to identify metabolites from the congested 1h nmr signals. thus, high-resolution nmr analysis has the potential to reveal the metabolic effect of enzymatic expression changes observed at proteomic level. figure  <dig> shows a 1h nmr spectrum of ca <dig> d <dig> calli metabolome. signals at δ  <dig>  , δ  <dig>  , δ  <dig>  , δ  <dig>   were assigned to the anomeric protons of glucose moiety of sucrose, α-glucose, β-glucose and the fructose moiety of sucrose, respectively. amino acids were identified at δ  <dig>   and δ  <dig>   as asparagine, at δ  <dig>   and d  <dig>   as glutamine, at δ  <dig>   as alanine, at δ  <dig>   and δ  <dig>   as valine. in addition to these compounds, δ-aminobutyric acid  was identified at d  <dig>  , δ  <dig>   and δ  <dig>   .

in the aromatic region , signals at d  <dig>  , δ  <dig>  , δ  <dig>   and δ  <dig>   were assigned to p-coumaric acid; signals at δ  <dig>  , δ  <dig>  , δ  <dig>  , δ  <dig>   were assigned to p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol glucoside; signals at δ  <dig>  , δ  <dig>  , δ  <dig>   were assigned to bis -2-isopropyltartrate  and signals at δ  <dig>  , δ  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , δ  <dig>  , δ  <dig>   were assigned to bis -2-tartrate   <cit> . table  <dig> summarizes all compounds identified in 1h nmr spectra with the chemical shifts and the coupling constants of the signals. no qualitative differences were found between ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> calli metabolic profile .

principal component analysis is an unsupervised clustering method requiring no knowledge of the data set and acts to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data analysis while preserving most of the variance within it  <cit> . the two first principal components  explained  <dig> % of the variation in the entire dataset . although pc <dig> discriminates both ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> calli, the intra-group variation is not negligible compared to the inter-group variation. indeed, no qualitative differences between ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> calli were inferred from the visual inspection of the 1h nmr spectra. furthermore, few quantitative differences were observed; as a result, there is not a strong separation between ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> calli in the pca score plot . nevertheless, as shown by the loading column plot of pc <dig>  ca <dig> d <dig> calli were characterized by high content of sucrose, glucose and alanine while the other compounds detected were in a higher amount in ca <dig> d <dig> calli . analysis of ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> calli were also performed by lc-ms spectroscopy and confirmed the identification of phenolic compounds by ion mass detection of the compounds .

discussion
in this work, the induction of shoot organogenesis from protocorm callus of v. planifolia was initiated for the first time. using an integrated approach combining proteomics and metabolomics, biochemical and physiological markers at the origin of callus organogenesis were explored.

organogenic callus culture
alone or in combination with auxin, several effects of tdz in orchids tissue culture have been reported  <cit> . in this study, protocorm-like structures were initiated by culturing v. planifolia seeds on basal medium containing  <dig>  mg l- <dig> tdz. callus induction and maintenance from these pls required the presence of iaa and tdz. the presence of these two hormones in the induction and maintenance of callus  may contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the embryogenic/organogenic state of the calli. in fact, tdz is considered to be one of the most active cytokinins for shoot induction in plant tissue culture  <cit>  and in particular orchids tissue culture  <cit> . in tissue culture tdz could promote synthesis or accumulation of endogenous cytokinins  <cit> . tdz could also influence endogenous levels of iaa  <cit> . in fact, calli on a <dig> medium containing  <dig>  mg l- <dig> tdz and  <dig>  mg l- <dig> iaa and did not develop roots at any instance. conversely, slightly differentiated chlorophyllic structures were clearly perceived after three months culture on the same medium . even if no endogenous plant hormone analysis were made in this work, these results lead us to think about endogenous ratios of auxin/cytokinin in calli cultured on a <dig> medium. endogenous cytokinins might not be at an adequate concentration to induce shoots differentiation.

shoot differentiation
exogenous tdz  supplied on a <dig> medium was probably not suitable to induce shoot differentiation or plb organogenesis. this was possibly the case for calli ca <dig>  conversely, these embryogenic/organogenic calli differentiate into shoots between  <dig> to  <dig> days after subculture on a <dig> medium which contains naa  and  <dig> days after subculture, plbs were well-developed on callus surface. shoot differentiation was probably induced by the removal of tdz and perhaps stimulated by the modulating effect of naa on the level of endogenous cytokinins. such modulation of naa on cytokinin metabolism was reported by nordstrom et al.  <cit> ; yin et al.  <cit> . the hypothesis of a high endogeneous level of cytokinins in embryogenic/organogenic calli should no be rejected. this hypothesis is supported by the additional experiments carried out in this work. as such, transfer of these six-months-maintained embryogenic/organogenic calli from a <dig> medium to hormone-free basal medium , has given rise to highly differentiated shoots similar to plbs developed by calli ca <dig> although the development of these shoots was slower . however, the hypothesis of a possible direct effect of tdz should not be discarded either. regarding our results, well-development of plbs was stimulated in the presence of naa. similar results have been reported by roy and al.  <cit> .

proteomic analysis of organogenic callus differentiation process
in order to understand the biochemical and molecular events underlying this plb organogenesis in embryogenic/organogenic callus differentiation, 2-d gel electrophoresis associated with maldi-tof-tof-ms approach was used to identify proteins that were differentially regulated, despite the lack of information about v. planifolia sequenced genome. this study constitutes the first proteomic analysis of vanilla. among the differentially expressed protein in ca <dig> d <dig> calli, amino acid-protein metabolism proteins and photosynthetic activity proteins were the top two protein categories demonstrating their important role in the early stage of vanilla callus differentiation process. the other upregulated detected proteins were from energy pathways and response to stress protein categories. the mitochondrial chaperonin cpn <dig>  is the only one stress response protein showing a high level of expression. chaperone proteins are overexpressed under several types of stress, including maintenance of cells during early culture or during initiation of in vitro plant development  <cit> . chaperone proteins are also known for their roles in the maturation of protein complexes and facilitate the folding process of newly synthesized proteins. in our study, stimulation of mitochondrial cpn <dig> could also be related to the transition of cellular proliferation status to cellular differentiation status in ca <dig> d <dig> calli. indirect support for this hypothesis is the observation that chaperone proteins were expressed at the breaker stage between tomato pericarp development and ripening  <cit> . so, the cell reprogramming and differentiation require the synthesis, assembling and stabilization of proteins as described by  <cit> . therefore it is not surprising that glutamine synthetase and proteasome complex, two proteins involved in amino acid - protein metabolism are significantly upregulated in ca <dig> d <dig> calli, thus showing the same trend at early stages of callus differentiation . indeed, glutamine synthetase is known to play a central role in plant nitrogen metabolism by increasing amides and amino acids synthesis required for protein synthesis  <cit> . on the other hand, the proteasome complex is associated with the breaking down process and degradation of denatured proteins or abnormal proteins that encountered errors in synthesis during rapid cell division  <cit> .

with reference to proteins involved in energy mobilization, our results show that cytosolic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  was significantly enhanced in calli ca <dig> . this glycolytic enzyme is often involved in in vitro organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis processes  <cit> . hence, enhanced glycolysis is probably involved in cellular division and differentiation in calli ca <dig>  sucrose mobilization and utilization from the culture medium is probably responsible for the activity of this enzyme involved in the glycolysis pathway. other proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and over expressed in calli ca <dig> d <dig>  are two major enzymes involved in the calvin's cycle  for four independent repeats of the biological experiment. for each sample the first three metabolite extractions from the first three independent repeats were done from the same calli used for protein extraction.

in this study, sucrose, glucose and alanine contents were in a higher amount in ca <dig> d <dig>  although the amount of asparagine, glutamine, valine and phenolic compounds detected were higher in the shoot differentiation calli , none of these changes was statistically significant. perhaps this is due to the small number of samples and/or the small metabolic variation between ca <dig> d <dig> and ca <dig> d <dig> calli. in addition, the calli cultures were stopped after  <dig> days at the stage where no visible differences between the ca <dig> and ca <dig> calli were observed; so ca <dig> calli were just at an early stage of the shoot differentiation and possible related metabolomic changes. this could explain the small difference observed between the two types of calli. nevertheless, our results suggest that there is an increase in secondary metabolites  and a decrease in sugars  in the early stages of shoot differentiation . indeed, phenolic compounds are formed from the glycolysis via the shikimic acid pathway  <cit> . these metabolomic results are in accordance with those obtained from the proteomic analysis where enzymes from the glycolysis pathway were more expressed in the ca <dig> d <dig> calli as compared to the ca <dig> d <dig> calli. the same is observed for amino acids and proteome changes such as the glutamine synthetase upregulation in ca <dig> d <dig> calli. glutamine synthetase plays a major role in plant nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . thus, among the amino acids involved in plant developmental process, gaba, asparagine and glutamine seem to accumulate in ca <dig> d <dig> calli as also observed by bender et al.  <cit> , murch et al.  <cit> , dowlatabali et al.  <cit> .

interestingly, the phenolic compounds identified in the callus from v. planifolia are known as intermediates in the vanillin biosynthesis. indeed, p-hydroxybenzylalcohol glucoside, bis -2-isopropyltartrate ;  <dig>  bis -2-tartrate  were detected previously in v. planifolia green beans  <cit> . our results highlight the importance of the p-coumaric acid as precursor in the vanillin biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . furthermore, glucoside a and b were never reported previously in v. planifolia cell or tissue culture. for this study, calli were obtained from protocorm of v. planifolia seeds. inside the green pods, the accumulation area of glucovanillin was shown to be very close to the seeds  <cit> . in these conditions, callus obtained from protocorm could be a material of choice for the study of the vanillin biosynthetic pathway. in our experiments, p-hydroxybenzylalcohol and glucosides a and b particularly are present in calli at early stage of shoot differentiation in ca <dig> calli. this could mean that those compounds in v. planifolia are accumulated in the younger or photosynthetic tissues  and then transported and converted to glucovanillin in the specialized tissues during green pod development as it has been observed previously  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study for the first time an integrated approach, incorporating two highly complementary techniques, proteomics and metabolomics analysis, was used in orchidaceae plant's developmental process research. we investigated the effects of exogenous plant hormones  on the biochemical mechanisms that release shoot formation at early stage of plb organogenesis during v. planifolia totipotent callus differentiation. the cellular reprogramming in this morphogenesis process suggested an early stimulation of several metabolic pathways including mobilization of sucrose, glycolysis and phenolic compound synthesis, amino acids and protein synthesis and protein stabilization among others to assemble the photosynthetic machinery in the cells. our next goal will be the integration of endogenous hormone profiles of totipotent callus and plbs elongated with proteomic and metabolomic information to obtain a large view of plant's development process.

our results show also that already at a very early stage of plant development coumaric acid and glucoside a and b are produced. as the compounds are precursors for vanillin, it might point to the possibility that metabolomics could be used at an early plant stage to determine the plants potential to produce vanillin. further studies should be of interest.
