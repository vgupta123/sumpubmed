BACKGROUND
carbohydrate-binding modules  are protein domains that recognize and bind to oligo- and polysaccharide ligands. within the carbohydrate-active enzyme database , cbms are divided into  <dig> families, based on amino acid sequence similarity, and members of each family display common ligand specificity. regarding reported specificities, characterized cbms have been found to bind to crystalline or non-crystalline cellulose, chitin, β- <dig> -glucans, β- <dig> - <dig> -mixed linkage glucans, xylan, mannan, galactan or starch, while others behave like lectins, binding to a variety of cell-surface glycans
 <cit> .

as protein domains, one or more cbms are generally associated with other protein domains, typically glycosyl hydrolase  modules, and can be localized at either the n or c-termini of proteins, although proteins formed exclusively of single cbms have been described
 <cit> . many cbms have been biochemically characterized and structural data are now available providing insight into structure/function relations . since it is known that many cbms are able to bind to polysaccharides, it is thought that when these are attached to catalytic domains their presence ensures intimate contact with the substrate and thus potentiated catalysis
 <cit> . moreover, it has been postulated that some cbms might possess the ability to locally destruct polysaccharide structure , thus improving enzyme accessibility
 <cit> .

family  <dig> cbms are small modules composed of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and are known as a “fungal cbm family”, because they were first detected in fungal cellulases and are exclusively produced by eukaryotes. the first characterized cbm <dig> was the cellobiohydrolase i from trichoderma reesei <cit> . since then, numerous cbm <dig> proteins from various fungi have been reported
 <cit> . the role of cbm <dig> in cellulases has been studied by separating the catalytic domain from its cbm, thus facilitating the study of the activity of the isolated catalytic domain on one hand and, on the other hand, the binding ability of the cbm. data acquired in this way has indicated that cbm <dig> binds strongly to crystalline cellulose and that its presence is required for full activity of the enzyme against the insoluble polysaccharide
 <cit> . a structural study of cbm <dig> from t. reesei cellobiohydrolase i have shown that overall architecture forms a wedge shape that is formed by irregular antiparallel triple-stranded β-sheet, which is stabilized by  <dig> disulfide bridges
 <cit> . a flat face of the wedge bears three aligned aromatic residues  that, along with polar residues , appear to form the cellulose binding interface
 <cit> . this is corroborated by the fact that the removal of any of these residues reduces the ability of the enzyme to degrade crystalline cellulose
 <cit> . nevertheless, the role of cbm <dig> at the molecular level is not fully characterized.

interestingly, cbm1-containing proteins have also been identified in fungal-like organisms called oomycetes
 <cit> . like fungi, oomycetes are ubiquitous in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments
 <cit> . they have similar modes of nutrition and ecological roles to true fungi and form tip-growing branching hyphae. oomycetes were initially classified within the kingdom of fungi, but molecular phylogenetic studies have now firmly established the distinct taxonomic positions of true fungi and oomycetes. oomycetes belong to the kingdom stramenipila, which includes diatoms, chromophyte algae, and other heterokont protists
 <cit> . numerous oomycete species are plant pathogens, such as the causal agent of potato blight phytophthora infestans or the sudden oak death pathogen phytophthora ramorum. features characterizing oomycetes are usually based on biochemical studies focused on phytophthora sp. and particularly, the presence of cellulose rather than chitin in their cell wall. however the presence of either chitin or chitosaccharides was observed in the saprolegniale oomycetes saprolegnia monoica and aphanomyces euteiches, where these compounds play an essential structural role
 <cit> .

the first oomycetal cbm1- protein described is the cellulose-binding elicitor lectin  from phytophthora parasitica, the causal agent of tobacco black shank disease
 <cit> . this non-enzymatic cell wall glycoprotein harbors two cbm1s associated to two pan/apple modules known to interact with polysaccharides or proteins
 <cit> . knockdown p. parasitica-cbel transformants are affected in cell wall polysaccharide deposition and adhesion to cellulosic substrates, including plant cell walls
 <cit> . in addition to structural and adhesive roles, cbel also induces plant defense responses, such as the production of reactive oxygen species, cytosolic calcium variation, expression of pr-proteins, and necrosis in several plant species
 <cit> . the mutation of a recombinant cbel has revealed that functional cbm <dig> is required for the full elicitor activity of cbel
 <cit> . moreover, it has been suggested that interaction of cbm <dig> module with the plant cellulose microfibrils is perceived by plant cells as a warning signal
 <cit> . similar results have been obtained with a fungal cbm <dig> from t. reesei suggesting that plants are able to perceive oomycetal as well as well fungal cbm1s
 <cit> .

the discovery of cbm1-containing proteins in oomycetes has raised the question of their origin in a lineage distantly related to fungi. it has been recently suggested that some genes encoding proteins involved in the breakdown of plant cell wall components have been acquired by oomycetes from fungi through horizontal gene transfer
 <cit> . however, cbm1-containing proteins were not detected in this analysis.

to better understand the origin, evolution and biological role of cbm1-containing proteins in oomycetes, we have performed data mining of fungal and oomycetal genomes and compared the protein organizations of different cbm1-containing proteins. in this way, we have revealed that oomycete-unique association of cbm <dig> with pan/apple domains.

moreover, using cbel from p. parasitica, which was shown to be a bona fide cellulose-binding protein, we propose a model structure of an oomycetal cbm <dig> and a role for the pan/apple domain in binding of the protein to additional carbohydrates. accordingly, we present experimental evidence for a galactose or n-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin activity associated with cbel. taken together, the results suggest that oomycetal cbm1-containing proteins have an ancient origin in the oomycete lineage and are involved in specific roles including adhesion to self and non-self components rather than in substrate degradation.

RESULTS
establishment of a comprehensive repertoire of cbm1-containing proteins in fungi and oomycetes
cbm1-containing proteins were collected from the cazy database
 <cit>  and curated for stramenopiles sequences which were further retrieved by mining predicted proteome on dedicated databases . seven oomycete genomes were mined for cbm <dig>  containing sequences. the oomycete species studied are characterized by different lifestyles, namely the obligate biotrophic species hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis and albugo laibachii, four hemibiotrophic phytophthora species  and the necrotroph pythium ultimum. sequences from various fungal databases, absent in cazy , were added. overall a set of  <dig> fully sequenced fungi representing the major evolutionary lineages within the fungal kingdom were included in the analysis . sequences were collected to build a representative set spanning the diversity of fungi and oomycetes. in total  <dig> sequences were selected for further analyses.
1:table s <dig> 

the survey of cbm <dig> revealed the presence of at least one cbm1-protein in  <dig> of the  <dig>  completed fungal/oomycete genome sequences examined. the total numbers of cbm1-containing proteins per sequenced fungal/oomycete species classified by life style  is shown in figure
 <dig>  chaetomium globosum as well as two other saprobes, the white rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium and the dung fungus podospora anserina encode the highest number of predicted cbm1-containing protein coding genes among sequenced fungal genomes. a closer look shows that most fungi that harbor necrotrophic or hemibiotrophic infection strategy , have the highest number of cbm1-protein coding genes per genome . interestingly, none or a single cbm1-protein gene is detected in biotrophic plant pathogen  and symbionts . thus, the expansion of cbm1-encoding genes in phytopathogenic fungi is correlated with hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic lifestyles. however, genes encoding cbm1-containing proteins are not restricted to fungal plant pathogens. indeed, the same number of genes encoding cbm1-containing proteins is present in aspergillus fumigatus and a. aculeatus, the former being a human pathogen and the latter a plant pathogen. likewise, the opportunist human pathogen rhizopus oryzea also displays genes encoding cbm1-containing proteins while genomes of other animal pathogens, including the amphibian pathogen batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, lack detectable genes encoding cellulose-binding proteins.

rather like true fungi, necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic oomycetes contain more genes encoding cbm1-containing proteins  than biotroph species . to complete this study, the genomes of arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa, and those of the closet phylogenic cousins of oomycetes, the diatoms thalassiosira pseudonana, phaeodactylum tricomutum and the brown algae ectocarpus siliculosus, which also belong to the heterokont lineage, were screened for cbm1-encoding sequences. however, no cbm1-encoding sequences were detected in these organisms.

fungal and oomycetal cbm1-containing proteins display distinct domain associations
the domain architecture of cbm1-containing proteins was investigated using the boundaries defined in pfam/smart annotations. domain architectures were assigned to  <dig> categories: i) "domain pair" which are sequences that contain a cbm <dig> and one other domain, ii) "multi-domain", which are sequences that contain one cbm <dig> and two other domains, iii) "single cbm1", which are sequences that are composed of a single isolated cbm <dig> and iv) "multi-cbm1", which are sequences that display more than one cbm <dig> . among eukaryotes, fungal proteomes display more than 50% of proteins can be classed as ‘single domain’
 <cit> . regarding cbm <dig> associations, the ‘single domain’ category is somewhat under-represented and pertains to roughly ~15% of the fungal and oomycetal cbm1-containing proteins . in contrast, 88% and 37% of fungal and oomycetal cbm1-containing proteins respectively possess ‘domain pair’ architecture. moreover, the ‘multi cbm1’ architecture is more widespread in oomycetes  than in fungi .

in fungi, 89% of the ‘domain pair’ category are proteins that contain a cbm <dig> appended to a catalytic domain belonging to the gh superfamily and 11% correspond to a cbm <dig> appended to non-catalytic modules  or wide functions . in sharp contrast, in oomycetes 90% of the proteins in the ‘domain pair’ category are characterized by a cbm <dig> associated with a non-catalytic domain, corresponding to the pan/apple module, which are known to display protein-carbohydrate or protein-protein functions. using signalp  <dig> 
 <cit> , it was found that  <dig> % of the proteins are predicted to contain a signal peptide, indicating that they are probably secreted. overall, the large-scale systematic analysis of domain architecture reported here clearly revealed the distinct architecture of fungal and oomycetal cbm1-containing proteins.

taking our study further, we compared the architecture distribution between the different fully-sequenced organisms. the abundance of domain associations per genome was computed and hierarchical clustering was used to assemble similar domain associations. an overview of the heat map  reveals a distinct distribution of domain combination in fungal and oomycetal proteins. a large proportion of fungal proteins, encompassing 70% of fungal plant pathogens, is characterized by cbm1s associated with catalytic domains involved in cellulose degradation. this includes fungal cellobiohydrolases  and β-glucosidases, exemplified by the cbm <dig> gh <dig> association. interestingly, a large number of fungal cbm1-containing proteins are characterized by the gh <dig> cbm <dig> association. the gh <dig> family was originally described as endo- <dig> -β-d-glucanases displaying weak activity, but recent studies have shown that gh <dig> members are in fact copper-dependent oxidases, that promote lignocellulosic substrate degradation
 <cit> . within this main group, one can observe a subgroup exclusively constituted by fungal plant pathogens that cause plant wilting symptoms , which are provoked by the colonization and proliferation of the microorganism in the xylem vessels of the host. in this small cluster, proteins predicted to degrade pectin  are also found.
1: table s
 <dig> 

oomycetes species are clustered in one, unique group presenting two main characteristics. first, catalytic domains classified in the cazyme database are not detected, except those of the gh <dig> family. second, most of cbm1-containing proteins are organized as multiple cbm <dig> modules, which are either standalone proteins or are appended to pan/apple domains. therefore, to investigate whether the absence of gh domains in oomycete cbm1-containing proteins reflects a general scarcity of glycosyl-hydrolases genes in their genome, the number of gh genes per genome was calculated. as shown in table
 <dig>  oomycete genomes contain a large set of glycosyl-hydrolases genes , except a. laibachii . thus the rarity in oomycetes of gh.cbm <dig> associations, coupled to an enrichment of cbm <dig> pan/apple associations, supports the hypothesis that specific functions can be attributed to cbm1-containing proteins from these microorganisms and bears witness to a distinct evolutionary history compared to fungi.

data were collected from a. laibachii <cit> , phytophthora sp <cit> , p. ultimum <cit> , b. cinerea <cit> , f. oxysporum, v. dahliae and m. grisea <cit> .

sequence and structural analysis of oomycetal cbm1-containing proteins
in order to identify residues that are conserved in both fungal and oomycetal cbm <dig> domains, the cbm <dig> amino acid sequences of the  <dig> proteins were extracted and visually compared using weblogo
 <cit> . as shown in figure
 <dig>  cysteine residues known to participate in the folding of fungal cbm1s
 <cit>  appeared at conserved positions in the oomycete sequences, though an additional cysteine residue was also detected . the conserved doublet of glycine residues found in the n-termini of fungal cbm1s is not conserved in oomycetes but the aromatic amino residues  and the polar residue glutamine  that are known binding determinants in fungal cbm1s
 <cit>  were frequently identified in the oomycete sequences. nevertheless, tryptophan and tyrosine residues in these motifs were often replaced by phenylalanine, suggesting greater diversity among the cellulose-binding determinants in oomycetes than in fungi.

to detect structural specificities of oomycete domains, a modeling approach was undertaken using the best characterized oomycetal cellulose-interacting protein, cbel. this protein is composed of a single polypeptide chain of  <dig> amino acids which starts with a  <dig> residue long signal peptide and then is built from the two symmetric n- and c- terminal parts, each resulting from the association of a cbm <dig> and a pan/apple domain  separated by a hinge region  that is rich in proline and threonine residues. the rather high percentage of identity  and similarity  between the t. reseei cellobiohydrolase i cbm <dig> and the cbm1s of cbel  meant that the cbm1s exhibited very similar hca plots , thus allowing the accurate prediction of the three β-sheet strands in both cbel_cbm1- <dig> and cbel_cbm1- <dig>  in addition the four cysteine residues forming two disulphide bridges in trcbm <dig> are strictly conserved in the cbel_cbm1- <dig> as shown by the alignment of the domains . accordingly, the predicted three-dimensional models of cbel_cbm1- <dig> and cbel_cbm1- <dig>  built from the nmr-coordinates of trcbm <dig> , exhibited a very similar fold . they consist of three anti-parallel strands of β-sheet  interconnected by loops. two disulphide bonds  contribute to the stability of folding, and especially to the stability of the stands  which contains the exposed aromatic residues involved in cellulose binding. both cbm1s contain two exposed aromatic residues f <dig> and y <dig> in cbm1- <dig> and y <dig> and f <dig> in cbm1- <dig> that are homologous to y <dig> and y <dig> of trcbm <dig> and are thus suitability positioned to stack onto cellulose chains . an additional q <dig> residue is also known to participate in the binding of trcbm <dig> to cellopentaose and cellohexose
 <cit> . this residue is conserved in cbel , suggesting that it could participate in binding to crystalline cellulose .
 <cit> , and rendered with raster3d
 <cit> 

although the pan/apple domains of cbel share low identity  and similarity  with the pan/apple domain of the human hepatocyte growth factor , their hca plots suggested a very similar structural organization . all pan/apple domains consist of three and four strands of β−sheets separated by a short α-helical segment. the four cysteine residues linked by two disulphide bridges occurring in the hgf pan/apple domain are conserved in both cbel_pan/apple domains. the three-dimensional models of cbel_pan <dig> and cbel_pan <dig> domains built from the nmr-coordinates of the n-terminal human hgf pan domain  consist of a central five-stranded antiparallel β−sheet associated to a short α-helical segment and to two loops containing a short strand of β−sheet . in the hgf-pan/apple domain, the α−helix is linked to two antiparallel strands of β−sheets by an extended loop to form a hairpin-loop region stabilized by two disulphide bridges. a similar harpin-region stabilized by the disulphide bridges c8-c <dig> and c18-c <dig>  or c8-c <dig> and c17-c <dig>  also occurs in cbel. however, the hairpin-loop region is shortened by the deletion of four amino acid residues corresponding to the 80lpft <dig> motif of the hgf-pan/apple domain. the carbohydrate-binding sites of plant lectins usually consist of shallow depressions resulting from the confluence of exposed loops containing hydrophilic and acidic  residues that anchor a sugar residue through a network of hydrogen bonds
 <cit> . in addition, an aromatic residue  completes the interaction by stacking against the pyranose ring of the sugar. the two exposed loops 18asn-val-asp-phe-arg-gly-asp-asp <dig> of pan <dig> or 18asp-lys-asp-tyr-arg-gly-asn-asp <dig> of pan <dig>  and 66ser-gly-thr-gly-thr-arg-thr <dig> of pan <dig> or 66ser-ala-ala-gly-thr-ala-thr <dig> of pan <dig>  fulfill these structural requirements and thereby could act as the carbohydrate-binding sites responsible for the hemagglutinating activity of cbel
 <cit> .
 <cit> , and raster3d
 <cit> .

six amino acid residues  that form the transition between the cbm1s and pan domains in cbel correspond to a strand of β−sheet . the first strand of β−sheet  of the cbel-pan/apple domains also contains the ultimate leucine or isoleucine residue of the β−strand of the cbel-cbm1s. this suggests that a continuous strand of β−sheet  interconnects the cbm <dig> and pan domains in the cbel molecule. using this information, a tentative three-dimensional model was built for the cbm1-1/pan <dig> n-terminal part of cbel . although speculative, this model readily fulfills geometric constraints  and reasonably accounts for both the associated cellulose-binding and carbohydrate-binding properties previously reported for cbel
 <cit> . a very similar model was obtained for the cbm1-2/pan <dig> c-terminal part of cbel .

surface plasmon resonance analysis of cbel lectin activity
in initial studies, the lectin activity of cbel was demonstrated by a hemagglutination test
 <cit> . to get further insight into cbel lectin activity and confirm the presence of the carbohydrate binding site inferred from molecular modelling, surface plasmon resonance  technology was used. since the detection of molecular interactions using this technology is highly dependent on the molecular weight of the analytes
 <cit> , rather that attempting the direct measurement of the interaction of cbel with various low molecular weight single sugars, we decided to check whether single sugars could interfere with the binding of large glycoproteins to cbel. screening of a collection of various pure glycoproteins allowed to detect the association of cbel with human lactotransferrin and with a melon hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein
 <cit> , both glycoproteins sharing the fact that their glycan moiety contain galactose residues. subsequent assays showed that the respective protein complexes were strongly destabilized by n-acetylgalactosamine . galactose also showed some activity in this assay, though less pronounced. this data confirms the lectin activity of cbel and suggests that it is involved in binding to polysaccharides or glycoproteins through the interaction with n-acetylgalactosamine or galactose residues.

discussion
in this work, a comprehensive set of fungal and oomycetal cbm1-containing proteins was described on the basis of cbm <dig> detection, and the domain organization of proteins was predicted. cbm1-containing protein genes were found in the vast majority of the analyzed genomes, and their number was clearly related to the lifestyle of the microorganisms. fungal and oomycetal saprotrophs, necrotrophs and hemibiotrophs express the largest number of cbm1-encoding genes whereas very few, if any, are found in biotrophs. this result is correlated with a dramatic reduction of proteins interacting with plant cell wall components in fungal or oomycete biotrophs
 <cit> . this situation could be explained by the induction of plant defense by plant cell wall-interacting proteins, which could be detrimental to the biotrophic lifestyle. in the case of oomycetes, this interpretation could be extended to non-enzymatic proteins such as cbel, which has been shown to be a potent elicitor of plant defenses
 <cit> . while necrotroph and hemibiotroph oomycetes encode  <dig> to  <dig> cellulose-interacting proteins, only one was found in the biotroph albugo laibachii and no unambiguous cbm1-encoding genes were detected in the hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis genome.

we further observed that oomycetes express a unique combination of domains corresponding to an association of a cbm <dig> with a pan/apple module. this combination does not appear in other eukaryote including diatoms and brown algae. so far, no enzymatic activity has been associated with cbm1-pan/apple proteins, with the best characterized protein of this type being the p. parasitica cbel. it has been shown that cbel plays a major role in phytophthora cell wall integrity, probably through interactions with the cellulose component of the oomycetal cell wall
 <cit> . thus, oomycete cbm1-containing proteins play multiple roles that target both the plant and the oomycete cell walls. however, this situation might be unique in the stramenopile lineage, since no cbm1-containing proteins were detected in other stramenopiles with a cellulosic wall, such as ectocarpus silicolosus <cit> . strikingly, while oomycetes potentially express a large set of glycosyl-hydrolases, only  <dig> genes were found to be associated with a cbm <dig>  whereas in fungi cbm <dig> is almost exclusively associated with an enzymatic domain. this result probably bears witness to the distinct evolutionary history of cbm <dig> and plant cell wall degrading enzymes in fungi and oomycetes. this could be related to the specific functions of cbm1-containing proteins, which in oomycetes are involved in cell wall organization, whereas in fungi, cbm1-containing proteins only target plant components, since fungal cell walls do not contain cellulose.

while cbm1s from oomycetes share similarity with fungal cbm1s, they also display specific features, as revealed by sequence alignment and structural modeling of cbm1s from cbel. this protein has been shown to bind crystalline cellulose and mutation of its cbm1s has revealed their role in cellulose binding
 <cit> . the two cbm1s of cbel, which both exhibit two well-exposed, spatially-aligned aromatic residues , readily account for the cellulose-binding properties displayed by both native and recombinant proteins
 <cit> . these aromatic residues are homologous to the aromatic residues  that are cellulose-binding determinants in the c-terminal cbm <dig> of the t. reesei cellobiohydrolase i
 <cit> , and are thus suspected to fulfill a similar function. indeed, mutational analysis of these residues revealed their important role in the binding of cbel to cellulose and cell wall components
 <cit> . an additional q <dig> residue  also participates in the binding of the trcbm <dig> to cellopentaose and cellohexaose
 <cit> . this residue is conserved in cbel_cbm1- <dig>  and cbel_cbm1- <dig> , suggesting that it could also participate in conferring cellulose-binding ability to cbel. moreover, residue n <dig> of cbel_cbm1- <dig> and s <dig> of cbel_cbm1- <dig> are well exposed and spacially-aligned with the aromatic binding determinants, and thus could also participate in cellulose binding. this is also the case for w <dig> of cbel_cbm1- <dig> and w <dig> of cbel_cbm1- <dig>  which is also located in the vicinity of the aromatic residues.

the occurrence of two pan/apple domains in cbel offers an interesting example of the widespread distribution of a structural motif among proteins of very distinct origins
 <cit> . although the exact function of the pan/apple motif still remains questionable, its involvement in protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions has been postulated from studies performed on plasminogen
 <cit> , prekallikrein
 <cit>  and on the human hepatocyte growth factor
 <cit> . interestingly, a pan/apple surface protein from the apicomplexan parasite toxoplasma gondii has recently been shown to bind chondroitin sulfate, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan found attached to proteins as part of surface proteoglycans in animal cells
 <cit> . one main constituent of the chondroitin polymer is n-acetylgalactosamine
 <cit> . accordingly spr analysis suggests that cbel is a n-acetylgalactosamine or galactose- binding lectin, two sugars that are frequently found as components of glycoprotein glycans. therefore, it can be hypothesized that this lectin activity is mediated by the pan/apple domain.

the tentative three-dimensional model proposed for the molecular organization of the cbm1-pan/apple association suggests that there is no steric hindrance between the two domains, thus allowing cbel to simultaneously display cellulose-binding and lectin activities. it has been shown that cbel is localized both in the inner and outer cell wall layers of p. parasitica <cit> , a dual localization which is coherent with its molecular organization and its multiple functions
 <cit> . interaction of cbel with a complex glycan, eventually bound to a cell wall polypeptide, could help its proper targeting and molecular docking to endogenous or exogenous cellulose microfibrils, and hence play roles both in cell wall scaffolding and in adhesion to exogenous cellulose. a lectin-based study has shown the presence of galactose and n-acetylgalactosamine residues at the cell surface of the oomycete p. parasitica <cit> . likewise, a proteomic analysis has shown that mucins, which are known to be highly glycosylated galactose- and n-acetylgalactosamine-containing proteins
 <cit> , form part of the p. infestans cell wall proteome
 <cit> . this strongly suggests the presence of endogenous ligands for the anchoring of cbel to the oomycete cell wall through its lectin activity. the fact that cbel is formed from two repeated cbm1-pan/apple associations further reinforces the potential of cbel as a versatile adhesin. in this context, the binding of cbel to plant hrgps could be of biological importance and should be further investigated.

the unique symmetric organization of cbel provokes the question of the molecular evolution of this type of molecule. cbel probably results from the duplication and fusion events of an ancestral gene, which itself results from the previous fusion of two genes encoding cbm <dig> and pan/apple domains respectively. so far, this particular combination of domains has only been found in oomycetes belonging to the peronosporale lineage, since in distantly related oomycetes, such as a. euteiches or s. parasitica, cbm1s are associated with another type of interacting domain
 <cit> . further analysis of oomycete genomes will probably help to clarify the origin of cbm1-containing proteins. the recent identification of cbm1-encoding genes in the basal oomycete eurychasma dicksonii , suggests an ancient origin of these proteins, probably related to their specific role in the oomycete cell wall and during interaction with their host.

CONCLUSIONS
using a genome mining approach to analyse fungal and oomycetal genomes, this study aimed at elucidating the origin and function of cbm1-containing proteins from oomycetes. accordingly, we revealed a unique combination of domains in these organisms in which cbm1s are linked to pan/apple domains. this finding in combination with 3d structural modelling and surface plasmon resonance analysis indicate that while cbm1s from fungi and oomycetes are similar, they are actually associated with different protein domains that confer quite different functions: while fungal cbm1s are combined to plant cell wall degradation enzymatic domains, those of oomycetes are associated with domains involved in adhesion to endogenous or exogenous ligands.
