BACKGROUND
there is currently great recognition of the potential of microalgae for the production of biodiesel. however, the difficulties in maintaining elevated culture biomass and oil productivity create bottlenecks that hamper the economic viability of the process . considerable work has been done to improve the conditions of microalgal culture in order to increase oil production . a concluding remark of many experiments is that most species increase their triglyceride  content under stress, such us nitrogen deprivation . the challenge is that tag accumulation seems to occur in conjunction with a reduction in cell proliferation, with a consequent decrease in total oil productivity. in this scenario, genetic engineering of lipid metabolism could constitute a powerful tool to overcome these limitations. however, following this route is not trivial, since a profound understanding of lipid metabolic pathways is required in order to tailor genetic engineering tools. this is particularly true for algae, organisms for which our knowledge about tag metabolism is incomplete and mostly inferred. first, algae are a paraphyletic group with representatives of several different kingdoms or supergroups  <cit> . second, not all algae accumulate tags as their main storage compound , hence it is expected that this creates fundamental differences in the regulation of the synthesizing pathways. third, even for the more-closely related green algae, recent studies have put in evidence interesting differences between microalgal and plant tag metabolism  <cit> .

tags are the major molecules of energy storage in most eukaryotes. there are several accepted pathways for the synthesis of tags. one of the best characterized is the kennedy pathway, which implies the sequential acylation of fatty acids  on a glycerol-3-phosphate backbone. in animals, yeasts and plants, in which it has been best characterized, this pathway is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, evidenced by subcellular localization studies of the main participating enzymes . the final step, the acylation of acyl-coa onto a molecule of sn- <dig> -diacylglycerol  is the rate-limiting step, and is catalyzed by several types of diacylglycerol acyltransferases . most dgats are integral microsomal membrane proteins. the most numerous and best characterized forms in mammals  <cit>  and plants  <cit>  are dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  which, despite sharing a few amino acids, show overall little sequence similarity with one another. in addition, other dgat forms were reported in particular tissues of certain plants .

in yeasts and plants, tag biosynthesis can also occur via phospholipid  remodeling, via the action of coa-independent transacylases  <cit> . the best characterized is membrane-bound phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase . pdat catalyzes the transfer of a fatty acyl moiety from the sn-2-position of a pl to the sn-3-position of sn- <dig>  2- dag, thus forming tag and a lyso-phospholipid  <cit> .

several structural and evolutionary studies have been done for dgats  and pdats  <cit> , but only a scarce amount have tried to analyze algal homologs from different supergroups in a phylogenetic context  <cit> . one of the key steps towards characterizing microalgal tag synthesis pathway refers to the proper annotation of enzymes. most enzymes are initially identified through in silico similarity searches using canonical enzymes with biochemical evidence as templates. most of these enzymes are from plants, yeasts and animals, which not always represent the best dataset to search for homologs in unrelated organisms, such as heterokonts. in addition, the tools most commonly used, such as blast, use limited information to perform a search and are not always effective at identifying distant homologs. other tools, such as hmmer, phi-blast or a combination of methods in an iterative form, include more parameters into the search and are, hence, more sensitive than blast .

with the purpose of identifying all possible enzymes within the tag synthesis pathway in algae and analyzing them in a phylogenetic context, we performed an in-depth sequence data mining. we followed a hmmer-iterative strategy that included  <dig> algae and  <dig> related and non-related eukaryotic species, as well as representative prokaryotic species. phylogeny and standard biocomputational analyses were performed in order to make testable predictions of the characteristics of the encoded proteins in different algae taxa. our results show some interesting new findings about several of the enzymes analyzed. one of the most significant refers to the identification of a novel dgat exclusive to green algae that shows moderate similarity to dgat <dig>  a soluble dgat previously characterized in plants  <cit> . subcellular localization prediction suggests that most green algal dgat <dig> proteins likely localize to the chloroplast. phylogenetic analysis evidences that the dgat <dig> clade shares a most recent ancestor with a group of uncharacterized proteins from cyanobacteria. heterologous expression of c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> produced an increase in the accumulation of tags in e. coli cells compared to control bacteria. altogether, our analysis provides useful information about the characteristics and phylogenetic relationships of the main enzymes that participate in tag synthesis. the implications of the existence of a green algal dgat <dig>  as well as its possible involvement in chloroplast tag synthesis, is discussed.

RESULTS
with the purpose of annotating the tag synthesis pathway in algae following a phylogenetic perspective and trying to identify novel homologs, we did a hmmer iterative data mining. we used the predicted proteomes from most algae with available sequenced genomes , as well as from a set of representative eukaryotic organisms . in order to do the analyses in a true phylogenetic context, we also searched for prokaryotic homologs in the hmmer website. although this procedure was done for pdat and for all the enzymes of the de novo synthesis of tags, we mainly focused on the enzymes of the rate-limiting steps, pdat and dgats.table  <dig> algae species used for computational analysis of the tag pathway

pdat in-silico analyses
pdats  belong to a superfamily that is also composed of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferases  , enzymes that catalyze the transacylation of acyl groups from phospholipids to a variety of sterols  <cit> . arabidopsis thaliana has two reported pdats   <cit>  and four lcat-like proteins. lcat <dig> is a phospholipid:sterol acyltransferase  involved in sterol ester synthesis  <cit> , whereas lcat <dig>  lcat <dig> and lcat <dig> mainly participate in phospholipid catabolism  <cit> .

for a proper characterization of the tag pathway, it is fundamental to distinguish between pdat and lcat activities, since most lcats biochemically characterized are not active with neutral lipids. with that purpose, we generated an lcat hidden markov model  that would allow for the identification of all the members of the superfamily, while using subsequent phylogenetic and clustering analyses to classify the superfamily members to each one of the groups. figure  <dig> shows a phylogentetic tree of pdats and lcats from algae and other representative taxa. table  <dig> summarizes the number of pdats identified in algae, while additional file  <dig> shows a detail of all the lcat superfamily homologs identified. among green algae, chlorophyceae have one pdat and one lcat <dig> homolog, whereas mamiellophyceae do not appear to have lcats. lcat <dig> homologs seem to be unique to sar algae. in fact, diatoms show lcat <dig> and no lcat <dig> homologs. pdat and lcat <dig> appear to have evolved from a most recent common ancestor, evidenced by the statistical support of the bifurcation .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships of algae members of the lcat superfamily. rooted circular phylogram representation of the consensus tree generated by the maximum likelihood  method  on the conserved regions of proteins from the lcat superfamily of the species detailed in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  gray circles represent ml bootstrap values >  <dig>  labels highlighted in yellow are algal sequences, numbers after the abbreviated species names are internal ids. a. thaliana proteins are shown in bold for reference. the scale bar represents  <dig>  amino acid substitution per site. a few clades were collapsed for simplicity. the inset is the same tree as an unrooted radial phylogram, with the ml bootstrap values for the four main clades: pdat, lcat <dig>  lcat <dig> and lcat3- <dig>  for the inset, the scale bar represents  <dig> amino acid substitution per site. to view the trimmed msa used to reconstruct the tree in phylip format and the raw consensus tree in newick format, see additional file 6

it was reported previously that human lcat contains several structurally conserved elements  <cit> , including a catalytic triad of ser-181-his-377-asp- <dig>  a salt bridge between asp- <dig> and arg- <dig>  and a so-called lid region. these features, as well as the conserved amino acids, were also identified in plant pdats  <cit> . for data mining, we used these conserved motifs to scrutinize sequences and correct msas. figure  <dig> shows that most of the sequences identified have all the motifs, whereas a few are truncated in either the amino or carboxy end. since gaps in msas are considered ambiguity, some of these last sequences were not used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. in these cases, clustering within the pdat or lcat group was determined by examining the scores obtained when the sequences were confronted with group-specific profile hmms. the msa in fig.  <dig> shows the conserved motifs that are most important for activity in all algae pdats, as well as others from representative taxa.fig.  <dig> msa of conserved regions of pdats from algae and examples from other representative taxa. the black line represents a. thaliana pdat, arrows and asterisks point to important amino acids within the structurally conserved elements: the so-called lid region, the salt bridge and the catalytic triad, based on human lcat  <cit>  and the analysis of plant pdats done by pan et al.  <cit> . sequence order corresponds to mafft alignment. species are indicated with their internal codes, first letter of the genus and first three letters of the species . ids correspond to uniprot ids when available or to specific genome ids when the sequence was not found in uniprot.  indicates that the corresponding sequence is truncated in any of the conserved structural elements




dgat <dig> in-silico analyses
dgat <dig> is part of a clan of proteins named mboat  that contains a variety of membrane acyltransferase enzymes. one of the superfamilies within the mboat clan is the sterol o-acyltransferase  group , which in fact contains three different families. the first one is the soat/acat family, whose best characterized members are mammalian soat <dig> and soat <dig> , which play a role in the formation of fatty acid-cholesterol esters  <cit> . the second is the are family , which contains the fungal homologs of animal soats  <cit> . the third family is the diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase  <dig>  family.

figure  <dig> shows a phylogentic tree of the soat/are/dgat superfamily. the soat clade contains all the soats from animals, and a related subclade of soat-like proteins from ciliate protists. the are clade contains the previously characterized enzymes from yeast and other fungi, as well as several proteins from non-photosynthetic protists and from red algae. last, the dgat <dig> clade contains members from most algae analyzed, as well as homologous proteins from many related and unrelated organisms within the tree of life. amongst green algae, all chloropycean and trebouxiophycean species analyzed show a single dgat <dig>  whereas mamiellophycean species appear not to have dgat <dig> . from sar algae, only symbiodinium minutum , bigellowiella natans  and the diatom pseudo-nitzschia multiseries appear not to have dgat <dig>  interestingly, there is a fourth clade in the superfamily constituted exclusively of proteins from red algae and glaucophyta and from the heterolobosean naegleria gruberi . when confronting the proteins within this clade to dgat1-, are- and soat -specific profile hmms, all the members of this group show very similar scores to both are and dgat <dig> proteins . considering that red algae have are homologs, these proteins could be dgat <dig> proteins that have diverged significantly from conventional dgat1s. hence, we termed this the dgat1-like clade. indeed, phylogenetic analysis shows that the dgat and dgat1-like clades are related by a most recent common ancestor , further supporting the idea that the members of the dgat1-like clade might have dgat <dig> activity. the main differences in the conserved amino acids, as described by cao et al.  <cit>  between this clade and the dgat <dig> group lie within motifs  <dig> and  <dig> . some of the modifications seem to be unique to this clade, such as a conserved proline  in motif  <dig> of dgat1s that is replaced with a glutamic acid  only in the dgat1-like clade. other differences are shared by other non-algal proteins, mainly metazoans, such as two phenylalanine  replacements to methionine , leucine  or valine  in motif  <dig> fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships of algae members of the mboat superfamily. rooted circular phylogram representation of the tree generated by the maximum likelihood  method  on the conserved regions of proteins from the mboat superfamily of the species detailed in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  gray circles represent ml bootstrap values >  <dig>  labels highlighted in yellow are algal sequences, numbers after the abbreviated species names are internal ids. homo sapiens and saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins are shown in bold for reference. other soat and are proteins from species not included in additional file  <dig> were also added to the analysis and are shown by their uniprot ids. the scale bar represents  <dig>  amino acid substitution per site. a few clades were collapsed for simplicity. the inset is the same tree as an unrooted radial phylogram, with the ml bootstrap values for the four main clades: soat, are, dgat <dig> and dgat1-like. for the inset, the scale bar represents  <dig> amino acid substitution per site. to view the trimmed msa used to reconstruct the tree in phylip format and the raw consensus tree in newick format, see additional file 7

dgat <dig> in-silico analyses
dgat <dig> is represented by pfam dagat family. it belongs to the pfam clan named acyltransferases , which also contains glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase , acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase  and other protein families with whom dgat <dig> has a modest similarity. dgat <dig> is by far the most abundant dgat in algae  <cit> . the precise number of homologs of each species cannot be unambiguously determined, since many of the sequences identified using sensitive data-mining are almost identical to each other, complicated by the fact that many genomes do not have extensive curation and have several examples of redundant predicted proteins coming from the same gene model. many of the sequences identified for dgat <dig> contain small replacements in conserved residues that are shared among a group of proteins, raising the question of whether those replacements might be functional. others are truncated and cannot be used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. since the similarity between dgat <dig> and the rest of the acyltransferase clan is indeed limited, we did not analyze the phylogenetic relationships of the superfamily. in this case, we retrieved the sequences from algae that had all the conserved motifs , as described by cao et al.  <cit> , even if they had small replacements. for instance, we identified six dgat2s in c. reinhardtii , while historically there had been five homologs reported . two of them have all the completely conserved residues , while the rest show replacements at different residues of motif five , the so-called vpfg block. dgtt <dig> and cre <dig> g <dig> have an f to i or to m modification, dgtt <dig> has a p to c replacement and dgtt <dig> has an f to y modification. it is noteworthy that dgtt <dig>  has biochemical evidence  <cit> , which indicates that the f to y replacement results in an active protein. hence, so far we cannot discard sequences that show small differences in the “completely conserved” residues, since amino acid replacement may not necessarily result in a loss of activity  <cit> .fig.  <dig> sequence features of algal dgat <dig> proteins. a msa of the six c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> identified by data mining. the six conserved motifs are shown. the level of residue conservation increases from light gray to dark gray. underlined amino acids correspond to the completely conserved residues defined by cao  <cit> . b sequence logos of motifs 1– <dig> for the four main clades  of the dgat <dig> family. the y axes show the logo bits; error bars are shown on each position. completely conserved residues are highlighted





phylogenetic analysis of all the full-length dgat2s from algae and other eukaryotic taxa uncovered interesting facts. with the exception of a few well-supported orphans, dgat <dig> proteins cluster in four main groups . all the animal and fungal dgat <dig> sequences cluster together, in what we called clade i or the animal-type dgat <dig> clade. all the algae higher ranks have sequences related to this clade, albeit in different subclades. the second group contains all the dgat <dig> sequences from plants, and numerous members from most of the algae analyzed. we called this clade ii or the plant-type clade. interestingly, this clade only contains sequences from photosynthetic eukaryotes, regardless of their taxonomic classification. the third clade consists exclusively of protein sequences from photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic sar species, with the exception of two sequences from the haptophycean alga emiliania huxleyi. hence, we called this clade iii or the sar-type dgat <dig> group. finally, the last clade contains several sequences from sar, single members from most green algae and a few sequences from excavata. we called this clade iv. a sequence logo analysis of motifs 1– <dig> shows that, with the exception of a few residues, all the clades show a high level of conservation in the completely conserved amino acids . regarding c. reinhardtii dgat <dig>  dgtt <dig> clusters in the animal-type clade, whereas dgtt <dig>  dgtt <dig>  dgtt <dig>  and dgtt <dig> cluster in the plant-type clade, although in different subclades, similarly to what was previously reported  <cit> . the newly identified dgat <dig>  corresponding to gene id cre <dig> g <dig>  clusters in clade iv. a majority of the proteins within this clade share the residue replacements present in the c. reinhardtii homolog . most interestingly, a majority of the members of this clade contain a strikingly high number of predicted transmembrane domains , as opposed to the remaining three clades, which contain an average of two or three transmembrane segments, with very few sequences above this number . this could point to important differences, worth exploring, in dgat2-membrane association and catalysis.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships of algae dgat <dig> sequences. rooted circular phylogram representation of the tree generated by the maximum likelihood  method  on the conserved regions of proteins from the dgat <dig> family of the species detailed in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  gray circles represent ml bootstrap values >  <dig>  labels highlighted in yellow are algal sequences, numbers after the abbreviated species names are internal ids. due to high number of sequences, some subclades were collapsed to allow proper visualization of important leaves and branches. the scale bar represents  <dig>  amino acid substitution per site. the inset is the same tree as an unrooted radial phylogram, with the ml bootstrap values for the four main clades: i-iv. to view the trimmed msa used to reconstruct the tree in phylip format and the raw consensus tree in newick format, see additional file 8





dgat <dig> in-silico analyses
one of the most remarkable findings of our data mining was the identification in green algae of sequences with moderate similarity to a soluble type of dgat, dgat <dig> , to this date only characterized in a handful of higher plants, including a. thaliana  <cit> , tung tree   <cit>  and peanut   <cit> . dgat <dig> proteins are composed of an amino-terminal region containing several disordered stretches and a carboxy-terminal thioredoxin-like 2fe-2s cluster-binding domain . when performing hmmer data mining starting with a profile hmm file containing all well-characterized plant dgat <dig> proteins, many of the sequences identified with high scores were similar to dgat <dig> only in their 2fe-2s domain. the disordered amino terminal segments of many of these proteins produced msas with considerably high entropy that were not suitable for phylogenetic analysis. this prompted us to do a first phylogenetic reconstruction based on the relationships of the 2fe-2s domain, which in pfam is known as the 2fe-2s_thiored domain. the resulting ml tree  shows two main well-supported groups. the first major group consists of several subclades of the 24-kda subunit of respiratory complex i nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes . we refer to this clade as the nuo <dig> clade. the other major group  can be divided into several statistically supported clades of sequences with distinct putative catalytic activities: i) cyanobacterial 2fe-2s thioredoxin-like ferredoxins, ii) bacterial and archaean cbix proteins, a family of cobalt-chelatases that function in the anaerobic biosynthesis of cobalamin   <cit>  and a group of related uncharacterized proteins from plants ; iii) bacterial sucrases, proteins that resemble ferredoxin and appear to have sucrolytic activity  <cit> ; iv) a group composed of both bacterial nuo <dig> proteins  and several cyanobacterial hoxf proteins   <cit>  and v) a group of bacterial proteins distantly related to nuo <dig> fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships of algae thiorredoxin-like ferredoxin domains. detailed rooted circular phylogram representation of the non nuo <dig> clades of the tree generated by the maximum likelihood  method  on the conserved regions of thiorredoxin-like ferredoxin domains of the species detailed in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  gray circles represent ml bootstrap values >  <dig>  ids correspond to uniprot ids. labels in bold are algal sequences. other sequences from species not included in additional file  <dig> were also added to the analysis and are shown by their uniprot ids. the scale bar represents  <dig>  amino acid substitution per site. the inset is an unrooted radial phylogram representation of the whole tree, which includes the nuo <dig> clades, with the ml bootstrap values for the four main subgroups. to view the trimmed msa used to reconstruct the tree in phylip format and the raw consensus tree in newick format, see additional file  <dig>  suc-fer, ferredoxin-like sucrases




the last monophyletic clade in fig.  <dig> with moderate support  is composed of two subgroups. the first one comprises the thioredoxin-like 2fe-2s domains from a group of uncharacterized proteins from cyanobacteria. although some of the homologs within this group are reported as nucleic acid-binding proteins, this is mostly based on the presence of an ob fold, which might be involved in the binding to other molecules. the second group includes thioredoxin-like 2fe-2s domains present in well-characterized dgat <dig> proteins, such as the a. thaliana  and a. hypogaea dgat <dig> homologs , as well as putative dgat <dig> proteins from all the green algae included in the analysis. interestingly, the dgat <dig> group is composed exclusively of 2fe-2s from chloroplastida , with no homologs identified in red algae or glaucophytes. the only exception was the clustering within this group of a thioredoxin-like 2fe-2s domain of a protein from the deltaproteobacteria haliangium ochraceum. this domain was the only one within the dgat <dig> clade that obtained a lower score when confronted to the dgat3-specific hmm file than to the hmm files of several other clades within the tree. this, together with the long branch length of the corresponding leaf and the heterogeneity of its positioning when analyzing many of the compatible trees used by phyml to build the consensus , puts a question mark on the proper clustering of this sequence.

when eliminating sequences that contributed to the high entropy of the full dgat <dig> msas, we could establish phylogenetic relationships of dgat <dig> sequences using a much larger portion of the proteins, which included most of the amino end. the resulting tree, shown in fig.  <dig>  shows that the dgat <dig> clade is only composed of proteins from higher plants and green algae, with excellent support provided by both ml and bayesian analyses. in addition, this tree supports our findings that reveal that the dgat <dig> group has a most recent common ancestor with a group of cyanobacterial 2fe-2s proteins.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships of algae dgat <dig> sequences. rooted phylogram representation of the tree generated by the maximum likelihood  and bayesian methods on the conserved regions of dgat <dig> and related sequences. ml bootstrap values are shown for all leaves, bayesian posterior probabilities are shown for the major branches after the bootstrap value, separated by a hash. one branch does not show the posterior probability because its value was below  <dig> . labels are uniprot ids, labels in bold correspond to algal sequences. the names and sequences within the four clades that were aligned to reconstruct the tree are shown with brackets. the scale bar represents  <dig>  amino acid substitution per site. to view the trimmed msa used to reconstruct the trees in phylip format and the raw consensus ml and bayesian trees in newick format, see additional file 10





since algal dgat <dig> proteins have not been previously characterized, we decided to do a series of in-silico and empirical analyses with the purpose of obtaining further information about this emerging protein family. figure 9a shows the amino acid sequence of c. reihardtii dgat <dig>  the carboxy-terminal region features the four cysteines involved in 2fe-2s binding, as well as amino acids involved in dimerization of the polypeptide, as determined by amino acid similarity using delta-blast. figure 9a also shows the  <dig> amino acids that could be modeled with a  <dig> % confidence on the thioredoxin-like 2fe-2s ferredoxin from aquifex aeolicus . in contrast, the formation of dimers could not be modeled with acceptable confidence by i-coth, from the i-tasser package. secondary structure analysis predicted that c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> is composed of 40% disordered regions, 47% of alpha helices and 9% of beta strands. disordered regions are mainly concentrated at the amino terminus of the protein. the catalytic site of dgat <dig> is not known for any of the members identified so far. however, the catalytic residues of many acytransferases have been determined, and a histidine  seems to be mandatory for activity in most of the protein families, often accompanied by an aspartic  or glutamic acid  separated by a few amino acids, most frequently four. in the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> families, this motif is towards the carboxy end of the protein  <cit> , whereas it tends to be towards the middle portion of the protein or the amino end in gpat and agpat  <cit> . we identified three motifs in c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> that are similar to acyltransferase motifs, shown in fig. 9a. two of them are in the amino-terminal portion, whereas the other one is to the carboxy terminus of the protein, further to the carboxy end than the 2fe-2s domain. it is noteworthy that the histidine in the motif closest to the amino end is conserved within the whole dgat <dig> clade, as shown in the sequence logo in fig. 9b.fig.  <dig> sequence characteristics of dgat <dig>  a

figure 9c and additional file  <dig> show a hydrophobicity and transmembrane segment comparison between c. reinhardtii dgat <dig>  dgtt <dig>  and dgat <dig>  the three sequences showed a considerable percentage of hydrophobic regions . interestingly, in dgat <dig> many of its hydrophobic regions translate into transmembrane segments, while only two hydrophobic regions represent transmembrane segments in dgat <dig> and none in dgat <dig>  one of the most remarkable findings is that, in dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  the catalytic motifs either flank or are partially embedded in hydrophobic regions, while the putative catalytic motifs of c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> are flanked by hydrophilic regions . this observation supports the idea that dgat <dig> likely participates in a soluble tag pathway. nevertheless, the presence of hydrophobic regions in c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> is indicative of both protein membrane association and the interaction with lipid substrates.

we also did subcellular localization prediction analyses of dgat <dig> proteins. table  <dig> shows that the dgat <dig> proteins from most of the green algae analyzed, with the exception of the homolog from coccomyxa subellipsoidea, were predicted to be localized to the chloroplast using predalgo, an algorithm specifically trained with green algal proteins. the ostreococcus tauri dgat <dig> has a truncated amino end due to several unidentified amino acids, which hinders prediction. although tags have been shown to accumulate in the chloroplast under nitrogen starvation  <cit>  and light stress  <cit> , a de novo pathway for the synthesis of tags within this organelle has not been reported yet. in order to extend the results obtained with dgat <dig>  we did in-silico analysis of protein targeting for all the dgats and pdats identified in algae. the results  show that some of the dgat <dig>  dgat <dig> and pdat homologs from green algae are predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast, whereas we did not find any cases of predicted chloroplast localization for any of these enzymes in sar, haptophycean and cryptophycean algae. for c. reinhardtii in particular, we analyzed the complete de novo pathway starting from the activation of fatty acids. table  <dig> shows that, with the exception of phosphadidate phosphatase , all the enzymatic steps of the pathway have at least one isoform with evidence of expression either at the transcriptional or protein level and predicted chloroplast targeting. our analysis also revealed that this pathway could be soluble, carried out by enzymes associated to chloroplast membranes but with no transmembrane segments . this would be consistent with the soluble, albeit cytosolic, pathway proposed in developing cotyledons of peanut, in which dgat <dig> is involved  <cit> .table  <dig>

for dgat families with well characterized members, such as dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  it is very common to infer activity of a new member by simple similarity analysis. however, dgat <dig> is a very incipient family, with very few members characterized. in addition, the dgat <dig> family is completely unrelated to dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  and the conserved sites that are important for activity are not known. with the purpose of interrogating c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> catalytic activity, we expressed this protein in e. coli cells . most groups of bacteria, including e. coli, do not accumulate tags to significant levels, which allows to easily detect the presence of such compounds dependent on the expression of a heterologous enzyme. tlc analysis of e. coli total lipids showed that c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> expression produced an increase in the accumulation of tags compared to the control . interestingly, the tag spot was only visible when gluconate and oleate were added to the culture during induction. the addition of those compounds triggers in the bacterial cell a set of responses collectively known as storage condition, which was previously used with the purpose of driving the bacterial metabolism towards tag synthesis  <cit> . the fact that tags were not detectable in dgat3-expressing e. coli cells without the addition of an excess of substrate  might indicate that, in a prokaryotic system, dgat <dig> activity cannot compete with phospholipid synthesis, which is a major lipid pathway in e. coli. interestingly, a spot that migrated further than the tags appeared in all samples of the tlc. according to its positioning relative to the standards and to results reported by others  <cit> , this spot might correspond to quinones, a type of neutral lipid present in e. coli that can be co-extracted with tags  <cit> . future experiments will be aimed at characterizing the dgat <dig> activity further and at determining the precise identity of the additional spot in tlcs.fig.  <dig> characterization of c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> expressed in e. coli. the coding sequence of c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> was cloned into pet19b vector  and transformed into e coli cells. the empty vector  was transformed as a control. protein induction was done on both dgat3-expressing and control cells. samples were taken before  and 4 h after induction . a soluble proteins from both samples were analyzed by 12% sds-page and either stained with coomassie brilliant blue  or transferred to nitrocellulose . the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> polyclonal antisera. the protein standards are shown on the right lanes, the dashes indicate the extra band in the gel upon induction and the protein recognized by the antisera, of approximately 40 kda. b lipids from e. coli cells were extracted with methanol: chloroform  and analyzed by thin layer chromatography  using a mix of hexane-diethyl ether-formic acid as the solvent system. standards are: ce, chloesterol ester; w, wax ester; tag, triglyceride; ffa, free fatty acids; chol, cholesterol; pl, phospholipids




discussion
data-mining and phylogenetic analyses
in this work, we have done a thorough data mining of the tag pathway, with an emphasis on the phylogenetic connections between homologs of algae from distinct supergroups. we have unveiled interesting relationships of the enzymes involved in the committing steps, dgat and pdat, that might have important evolutionary and functional implications. our data mining and phylogenetic analyses allowed us to make testable predictions on the identity of enzymes that are part of complex superfamilies. future experimentation will put to the test the hypotheses arisen from this work.

one of the most remarkable findings of our data mining was the identification of sequences with similarity to plant soluble dgat <dig> proteins, exclusively in the green algal lineage. there are several interesting facts about dgat <dig>  first, phylogenetic analysis of either the 2fe-2s domain or a much larger portion of the protein show that the dgat <dig> clade shares a most recent ancestor with a group of uncharacterized proteins from cyanobacteria. the highest hmmer search scores of the dgat <dig> hmm file were, after the members of the dgat <dig> clade, obtained with cyanobacterial proteins. in contrast, no prokaryotic sequences were above the inclusion threshold in the searches done for dgat <dig>  dgat <dig> and pdat, hence no prokaryotic sequences are included in the phylogenetic trees of these protein superfamilies. these findings suggest that dgat <dig> is a very distinctive protein within the tag-synthesizing pathways. dgat <dig>  dgat <dig> and pdat are proteins exclusive to eukaryotes, in agreement with the fact that the synthesis of tags is widespread in eukaryotic organisms, whereas tags accumulate to significant levels only in a few prokaryotic groups  <cit> . these enzyme superfamilies most likely evolved in eukaryotes coincident with an increase in the complexity of the lipid metabolic pathways, as exemplified by the intricate phylogenetic relationships between dgat <dig> and soat, or pdat and lcat or by the extensive multiplication of dgat <dig> in algae. dgat <dig>  in contrast, is likely a relic of cyanobacterial ancestry.

plant dgat <dig> proteins are reported to be cytosolic, in agreement with their localization prediction. in contrast, most green algal dgat <dig> are predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast. we could speculate that the members of chloroplastida  inherited dgat <dig> from cyanobacteria and, if the localization predictions are confirmed, this protein remained chloroplastic in green algae, whereas it found its eukaryotic functions in the cytosol in higher plants. this would point to another interesting difference between green algae and higher plants regarding tag regulation. we could further question whether dgat <dig> was acquired by the whole archaeplastida supergroup during primary endosymbiosis and subsequently lost in red algae and glaucophytes, or evolved later on only in chloroplastida. although the latter seems the most parsimonious explanation, further analyses could certainly allow to differentiate between these two possibilities. regardless of its origin, dgat <dig> seems to be exclusive to the green lineage. proteins with this characteristic have been clustered within the viridicut <dig> group in a recent inventory of proteins common to plants and green algae  <cit> . the authors of that analysis determined that most of the viridicut <dig> proteins lack cyanobacterial homologs and might be involved in eukaryotic processes that are not exclusively associated with the photosynthetic function. it is difficult to unambiguously answer whether dgat <dig> lacks cyanobacterial homologs, since the function of the members of the cyanobacterial clade related to dgat <dig> is not known. nevertheless, the fact that tag synthesis is mostly a eukaryotic function that, although related to the plastid, exceeds photosynthesis, suggests that dgat <dig> shares this characteristic with other viridicut <dig> proteins.

characteristics of c. reinhardtii dgat3
dgat <dig> proteins are characterized by the presence of an 2fe-2s domain that has a fold similar to that present in thioredoxins  <cit> . many of the bacterial proteins containing this domain are small , soluble low-potential electron carriers  with a single 2fe-2s cluster  <cit> . the exact role of many of these proteins is still unclear. their homologous domains in larger redox enzymes  function as electron carriers  <cit> . in this scenario, we could imagine that dgat <dig> has a dual activity in which electron transfer is coupled to the acylation reaction. although the precise site for catalytic activity of dgat <dig> proteins is not known, there are few important amino acids that seem to be common to many acyltransferases, as analyzed by saha et al.  <cit> . we identified three motifs that could catalyze acylation reactions in c. reinhardtii dgat <dig>  two in the amino terminal region and one to the carboxy-terminal portion of the 2fe-2s cluster-binding domain. future experimentation will shed light to the precise site in dgat <dig> where catalysis occurs.

the chloroplast tag pathway and possible involvements of pdat, dgat <dig> and dgat3
the importance of a chloroplast pathway for the synthesis of tags in green algae became evident with recent work done in c. reinhardtii. fan et al.  <cit>  showed that, during nitrogen starvation, a high proportion of the tag produced is composed of 16-carbon  fatty acids in the sn- <dig> position of the glycerol backbone and is, in fact, mostly synthesized from dag generated in the chloroplast. the presence of lipid droplets inside the chloroplast was also evidenced by microscopy in starch-less c. reinhardtii mutants grown in mixotrophic conditions  <cit> . one major player in the synthesis of chloroplast tags in green algae could be pdat. the c. reinhardtii pdat homolog is known to localize to the chloroplast  <cit>  and to use preferentially c <dig> fatty acids  <cit> . a loss-of-function analysis of c. reinhardtii pdat revealed that it might contribute to approximately 25% of the tag accumulation under nitrogen starvation in c. reinhardtii  <cit> . in contrast, it has been proposed that the contribution of the chloroplast to total tag synthesis during nitrogen depletion could be much higher  <cit> , suggesting that other mechanisms are involved. analysis of chloroplast plastoglobuli and cytosolic lipid droplets in the green alga dunaliella bardawil revealed similar fatty acid composition in the sn- <dig> and sn-1 +  <dig> positions for the tags in both types of lipid bodies, suggesting a common origin  <cit> . under nitrogen starvation, the formation of cytosolic lipid droplets preceded that of plastoglobuli and appeared to be synthesized via the de novo pathway, whereas that of plastoglobuli seemed to be mostly originated from membrane remodeling  <cit> . electron microscopy analysis revealed that the er membrane and the cytosolic lipid droplets per se attach to the chloroplast envelope, leading the authors to hypothesize that cytosolic tags might be transferred to the chloroplast through associations between the er membrane and the outer membrane of the chloroplast envelope   <cit> . such associations were also observed in c. reinhardtii  <cit> . therefore, despite the differences in tag accumulation between the two algae, the idea that interactions between the er and the omce allow the interchange of fatty acids, dag and tag between both compartments is likely for all green algae.

in a. thaliana, rosette lipid analysis revealed that tag accumulation increases considerably under certain situations, such as ozone-related stress  <cit>  or senescence  <cit> . in those conditions, tags accumulate preferentially in the chloroplast. rosette leaf mrna analysis evidenced that one clone annotated as dgat <dig> increased notoriously in senescent leaves compared to young leaves, allowing the authors to propose that dgat <dig> has an important role in senescence by sequestering de-sterified fatty acids coming from the thylakoid  <cit> . the presence of dgat activity related to plant plastids was shown more than 30 years ago in isolated spinach chloroplasts, where it was found in the chloroplast envelope  <cit> . unfortunately, back then, the isoform responsible for activity was not analyzed or identified, but it could be a dgat <dig>  in this work, localization analysis predicted that c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> localizes to the chloroplast. in this scenario, and considering that this protein has transmembrane domains, it is possible that dgat <dig> associates not only to the er, but also to the omce, in c. reinhardtii.

in this context, the participation of dgat <dig> could be completely different. being a soluble, yet membrane-associated, protein with an 2fe-2s domain, we could imagine a participation in the stroma, in relationship to the thylakoid membrane. considering that it might be, the same as its homologous proteins characterized so far, a low potential redox protein, we could hypothesize that c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> accepts electrons from the final transporters of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and reduces nadp+. the nadph formed in this way could be used for fatty acid synthesis, which could then be used for tag synthesis by dgat <dig>  furthermore, dgat <dig> might be responsible for tag formation in the chloroplast in situations that produce an excess of electrons. the hypothesis that tags might serve as a sink for electrons moving through the photosynthetic electron transport chain has been previously postulated  <cit> . as previously suggested  <cit> , during stress, excess photosynthetic electrons could be used to generate reducing equivalents, in the form of nadph, for fatty acid synthesis. since an excess of free fatty acids is potentially harmful itself, the dual action of dgat <dig> would ensure the coupling of nadp+ reduction, fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid acylation into tag, providing a complete protective mechanism. although, during stress, much of this could occur in the er as proposed  <cit> , we hypothesize that the green algal chloroplast might have a complete pathway to do this in an independent fashion.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge this study represents, to date, the most comprehensive sequence analysis of the main enzymes that participate in tag synthesis in algae, including their phylogenetic relationships with homologs from other organisms and important structure-function predictions. our results confirmed the complex connections between the distinct acyltransferase superfamilies. regarding the green alga c. reinhardtii, we observed that tag synthesis is well represented by the presence of numerous acyltransferases, including one pdat, one dgat <dig>  six dgat <dig> and one dgat <dig>  dgat <dig> is a soluble protein exclusive to the green linage, with predicted chloroplast localization. this protein is the only acyltransferase activity of those analyzed associated to a cyanobacterial heritage. heterologous expression confirmed that c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> is indeed a dgat. as evidenced by subcellular targeting prediction, green algae are likely the only algal group with a chloroplast pathway for tag synthesis. methodologically, our analyses allowed us to conclude that data-mining by means of hmmer iterative search followed by phylogenetic analysis and/or protein clustering is a more adequate strategy for lipid functional genome analysis compared to the use of non-iterative heuristic methods, particularly for paraphyletic groups like algae.
