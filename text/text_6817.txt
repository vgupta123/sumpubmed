BACKGROUND
rainbow trout, oncorhynchus mykiss, is an important fish species for aquaculture and has been introduced throughout the world. it is also probably one of the most widely studied fish species with a long history of research carried out in physiology, nutrition, ecology, genetics, pathology, carcinogenesis and toxicology . its relatively large size compared to model fish like zebrafish or medaka, makes rainbow trout a particularly suited alternative model to carry out biochemical and molecular studies on specific tissues or cells that are impossible to decipher in small fish models. the genomic resources in rainbow trout are now being extensively developed and a few high-throughput dna sequencing programs of ests have been recently initiated  <cit> . agenae   <cit>  is a project led by the french national institute for agricultural research , that focuses on genomics of several livestock species . the objectives of this program are the identification and characterization of the expressed part of genomes, the mapping of entire genomes, and the study of genetic diversity in animal populations. as a first step for the characterization of the expressed part of the genome of rainbow trout, we initiated a high-throughput est sequencing program. among other interests, this resource will allow large scale expression profiling experiments using microarrays based on a well characterized cdna clone collection.

RESULTS
cdna libraries construction and characterization
we constructed three directionally cloned rainbow trout cdna libraries: two from reproductive tissues i.e., ovarian  and testicular  tissues, and one highly complex pooled tissue cdna library. the pooled tissue library was made in order to be as representative as possible of the entire expressed genome of rainbow trout. for this purpose, mrna from  <dig> different tissues , sampled at different developmental stages or in different physiological conditions, and mrna from entire eyed-stage embryos and hatching larvae, were used for this pooled-tissue library construction. the three resulting libraries displayed a high initial clone complexity . approximately 98% of the cdna inserts were larger than  <dig> bp and the average insert size ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb depending on the library. each of the  <dig> libraries was normalized according to previously described protocols  <cit> , in order to decrease the representation of abundant mrna. all normalized libraries were subsequently submitted to one  or two  runs of subtraction with the already sequenced clones in order to decrease redundancy.

ests sequencing
high-throughput est sequencing was carried out on these initial, normalized and subtracted libraries . the pooled-tissue library was the most extensively sequenced with 82% of the total sequencing effort  as this library was not focused on a particular biological function, and thus of broad interest for a vast community of physiologists. the testis library was also quite extensively sequenced  as this library was found to be very informative in terms of production of new sequences, while the sequencing of the ovary library was interrupted after a first round of sequencing  as this library was found to be very redundant . until now, a total of  <dig>  <dig> reads sequences have been performed on  <dig>  <dig> clones; among those,  <dig> % were found valid . all the valid sequences have been released in international databanks . the proportion of empty vectors was found to be very low.

in order to provide an important set of well annotated clones, the 5' end sequencing strategy was favoured. however, due to the use of an excess of oligo during the first reverse transcription of the library construction, the polya sequence remained short enough to allow sequencing of the cdna 3' ends. a 3' end sequencing strategy was therefore carried out on  <dig>  <dig>  of the sequenced clones with a good success rate . this 3' strategy is a useful way to distinguish genes in a closely related family using the more divergent 3' end non coding region.

sequence analysis
influence of normalization/subtraction on the pooled-tissue library
following est sequence assembly into putative transcript groups , we calculated the percentage of novel est clusters as a function of the number of clones sequenced . before normalization , the percentage of new clusters decreased very rapidly. normalization considerably slowed down this decrease and induced a 10% increase of novel clusters. before the first subtraction, a few large clusters were however still observed, including a high percentage of the sequenced clones encoding putative orthologs of trypsin . the fact that these sequences were overrepresented in the library, even after normalization, was surprising, and we do not have any rational explanation. however, during the first subtraction we specifically removed these abundant clones by increasing their representation as driver dna in the subtraction protocol  <cit> . after this subtraction, the est analysis in the pooled-tissue library revealed that only  <dig> clones out of  <dig>  <dig>  belonged to these trypsin clusters. this demonstrated the efficiency of the specific subtraction strategy in decreasing redundancy. as a mater of fact, the gain of novelty was then rather high following the first subtraction , probably due to the removal of these largest clusters. following the second subtraction the gain in novelty was around 15â€“20%.

redundancy and quality of the libraries
with regards to clone redundancy, we listed the  <dig> biggest clusters considering all publicly available ests , and the  <dig> biggest clusters containing only agenae ests . among these clusters, the  <dig> biggest ones correspond to ests which are highly represented in  or specific to  the agenae ovary library. the best swissprot hit for cluster bx <dig> .p.om. <dig> corresponds to a zona pellucida sperm-binding protein precursor, a protein that is known to be highly expressed in the ovary  <cit>  and whose cdna has already been described as over-represented in a fish ovary library  <cit> . cluster cr <dig> .p.om. <dig> does not exhibit any significant homology and a careful examination of the ests belonging to this cluster show that  <dig> % of these ests actually start at exactly the same nucleotide position, which probably reflects an amplification artefact that occurred during the process of library construction. similarly,  <dig> out of the  <dig> biggest clusters of ests specific to the agenae libraries are also either specific to, or overrepresented in this ovary library . due to this rather poor quality in terms of novel sequence discovery, we stopped sequencing this library. apart from these highly redundant ests from the ovary library, redundancy was found to be relatively low in other agenae libraries with the vast majority of the est sequences within cluster classes containing less than  <dig> ests . as shown in table  <dig>  the pooled-tissue library produced  <dig> of the biggest trout clusters. one cluster  corresponds to a homolog of the zebrafish protein es <dig> that is specifically expressed in the adult retina  <cit> . the other  is one of the large clusters of putative orthologs of trypsin overrepresented in the non subtracted pooled-tissue library mentioned above. no highly redundant clusters of ests were identified in the testis library with the largest clusters represented by only  <dig> ests . this demonstrated the high quality of this testis library in terms of diversity and probably reflects the high complexity of the repertoire of genes expressed in testicular tissue as previously shown in large scale ests sequencing programs in other fish species  <cit> 

contribution of the agenae est collections
the overall released data, including sequences from the testis and ovary libraries, represented  <dig>  % of the total rainbow trout sequences  in international databases in february  <dig>  based on the sigenae trout assembly version  <dig>  <cit> , our est sequences added  <dig>  <dig> unique clusters  to the total of  <dig>  <dig> clusters of putative transcript groups characterized after clustering of all ests available in rainbow trout . among these  <dig>  <dig> clusters ,  <dig>  <dig>  were represented by at least one agenae est. these figures were obtained by running cap assemblies under default parameters , and are close to those found in the tigr clustering. however, we do realise that the number of contigs  can vary when different stringencies are used, and that when using the default parameters there may be cases where paralogous genes and certainly alleles are clustered, although we have not yet gone deeply into that subject. the unigene cluster number is smaller , may be in part because it contains more paralogous gene clustering, but more likely because it does not use a large part of the singletons available.

sequence annotation
for  <dig> out of the  <dig> single organs initially gathered to construct the pooled-tissue library, a rapid search identified at least one est matching for a gene considered as "specifically" expressed in this tissue . this shows that this library was potentially representative of the various tissues used, although we do realize that some of these cited genes are probably not strictly tissue specific but could be better described as genes which are highly expressed in a particular tissue. low abundance cdna may be difficult to detect through such est sequencing projects. however, the fact that most genes are expressed in many tissues, combined with the normalization procedure probably increased the chances of picking them up in such a pooled-tissue library.

although cdna library construction and est sequencing is a time and money consuming task, the most common strategy still consists in sequencing numerous tissue specific libraries in order to provide a large number of clusters. for instance, in the medaka, oryzias latipes,  <dig>  <dig> clusters were generated from  <dig>  <dig> est obtained from  <dig> different tissue specific cdna libraries . in trout, with slightly more ests  coming mainly from  <dig> pooled-tissue libraries , the last tigr clustering  detected twice as many clusters . the pooled-tissue libraries strategy combined with normalization/subtraction methods may thus be a better approach for enrichment of different transcripts. actually, some recent est projects rely on pooled-tissue libraries  <cit> . however the pooled-tissue strategy suffers from a lack of information concerning mrna tissue origin and it is then not possible to carry out in silico analysis of tissue differential expression  <cit> . a strategy based on pooled-tissue library with a tissue specific dna identification tag, has recently been proposed  <cit> . this would combine the advantages of the pooled-tissue library with keeping the information on the tissue origin of each est.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion our rainbow trout cdna libraries provided a large set of well characterized clones for future studies. the agenae sequencing project together with ongoing collaborative efforts of the ars-usda program  <cit>  and the genome bc project  <cit>  now places rainbow trout in the position of being one of the major fish models, in terms of ests present, in public databases just after the zebrafish, danio rerio . we are now using this important sequence information and our corresponding clone collections for producing dna arrays in order to examine global gene expression in rainbow trout  <cit> . a micro-array, containing  <dig>  <dig> well annotated and unique cdnas chosen for their informative annotation and their low redundancy, is now produced in large numbers in our resource centre   <cit> , and used for gene expression profiling by several research teams.
