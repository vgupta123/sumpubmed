BACKGROUND
animal african trypanosomiasis, called sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle, is a resurgent disease in africa. nagana is caused by trypanosoma congolense , trypanosoma vivax  and trypanosoma brucei  subspecies. most research on african trypanosomes has focused on t. brucei, whereas only few studies have been done with other african trypanosomes including t. congolense. in wild animals, these parasites cause relatively mild infections while in domestic animals they cause a severe, often fatal disease. because of nagana, stock farming is very difficult within the tsetse belt of africa  <cit> .

although of crucial importance for their survival, cyclical transmission and hence pathogenicity of trypanosomes, trypanosomes lack the biochemical metabolic machinery synthesizing sialic acids , but use a unique enzyme, trans-sialidase  to transfer sia onto the parasites surface molecules from the environment. structurally ts belong to the family of sialidases . in contrast to the usual sialyltransferases, ts does not utilize cmp-activated sia as monosaccharide donors, but catalyzes the transfer of carbohydrate-linked sia to another glycan forming a new α <dig> -glycosidic linkage to galactose or n-acetylgalactosamine.

whereas more detailed studies exist on the role of ts in the pathogenicity of t. cruzi, the etiologic agent of chagas diseases in south america, where ts was first discovered  <cit> , the current knowledge about the corresponding enzymes in the african trypanosomes is very limited. of all the african trypanosomes, only t. brucei full length ts genes have been cloned and studied  <cit> . sialylation of parasite surfaces is believed to protect the parasites from the action of glycolytic enzymes as well as from immunocompetent substances present in the tsetse gut and blood meal respectively, as well as influencing the interaction of parasites with the gut epithelial cells  <cit> . in the african trypanosomes where ts is thought to be expressed only in the procyclic insect stages  <cit> , ts has been shown to increase the survival, maturation and hence establishment of the parasites in the vector midgut  <cit> .

two ts forms, named ts-form  <dig> and ts-form  <dig>  have been purified from procyclic t. congolense cultures  <cit> . interestingly, glutamic acid and alanine-rich protein  was co-purified with ts-form  <dig>  suggesting that garp may be a natural substrate for ts-form  <dig>  interestingly, ts-form  <dig> had significantly less sa activity and higher ts activity, whereas sa activity was predominately found in preparations of ts-form  <dig>  an anti-t. congolense ts antibody  was developed using ts form  <dig> as antigen. this antibody is specific for t. congolense ts recognizing ts-form  <dig> and ts-form  <dig>  but does not bind to t. brucei ts. peptides micro sequencing revealed the amino acid sequence vvdptvvak in ts-form  <dig>  subsequently, fragments of two ts genes  were sequenced, sharing about 50% sequence identity  <cit> . ts <dig> encoded this peptide sequence, whereas in ts <dig> this sequence ended in vvk. these data strongly suggested that the gene product of ts <dig> has been present in ts-form  <dig>  nevertheless, it has remained unclear whether only ts <dig> and/or ts <dig> gene products were present in ts-form  <dig> and ts-form  <dig> preparations. due to the fact that the monoclonal antibody mab 7/ <dig> bound both ts preparations, it is quite possible that ts-form  <dig> contained at least some amounts of ts <dig> gene product, which might have been responsible for the ts activity of this preparation.

here, we report the cloning of eleven trans-sialidase ts <dig> variants from t. congolense and their recombinant expression in cholec <dig> cells. furthermore, the enzymatic properties of two of these recombinant ts <dig> variants were compared with ts from t. cruzi.

RESULTS
diversity of ts <dig> genes and structural model
based on the partial sequence of ts <dig>   <cit> , an open reading frame in the welcome trust sanger institute  database was identified. the full-length translation product consists of  <dig> amino acids extending the partial sequence of ts <dig> by  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus and by  <dig> amino acids at the c-terminus. it contains a  <dig> amino acids n-terminal signal peptide and a catalytic domain , which is connected through a long α helix  to a lectin domain  followed by a potential c-terminal gpi-anchor attachment site . furthermore, nine potential n-glycosylation sites were identified .

t. congolense ts <dig> shares about 57% sequence identity with t. brucei ts  and 48% with t. cruzi ts  . the t. brucei ts has a prolonged n-terminus of approx.  <dig> amino acids, which is conserved in t. congolense ts <dig> sharing 50% amino acids, but is absent in t. cruzi ts. the catalytic domain of both african proteins has 60% and the lectin domain 43% sequence similarities. t. congolense ts <dig>  like t. brucei ts and t. rangeli sa, has no c-terminal sapa domain typical for t. cruzi ts  <cit> . almost all amino acid residues reported to be required for ts activity are identical in ts <dig> with the exception of a <dig>   <cit> , r <dig>  g344-q <dig> and y <dig>   <cit>  .

to produce recombinant protein for enzyme characterization, the dna encoding amino acids 17- <dig> was amplified using genomic t. congolense dna as a template and inserted into a mammalian expression vector as described in methods.  <dig> clones were picked from two independent cloning experiments and sequenced. interestingly, not all the  <dig> clones had identical sequences and eleven different sequences were obtained , exhibiting an overall amino acid identity of  <dig> %. a more detailed search of the wtsi database using these sequences as queries confirmed the presence of these ts <dig> genes in the t. congolense genome database. as shown in figure  <dig>  changes are not evenly distributed over the protein sequences. eight were found in the lectin domain and  <dig> in the catalytic domain, some close to the predicted active site as shown in figure 4a.

for a better understanding of how these differences may affect ts function, we calculated a model structure  for ts <dig> e- <dig> by homology modeling based on the crystal structure of t. cruzi ts  <cit> , which was complexed with the sia derivative 3-fluoro-5-n-acetyl-9-benzamido- <dig> -dideoxy-neuraminic acid. the superimposed structures of t. cruzi ts and the t. congolense ts <dig> e- <dig> model had a root mean square deviation  of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> aligned residues.

in figure 4a, amino acids of the active site are highlighted. most of the amino acids reported to be relevant for ts activity are identical in all t. congolense ts <dig> variants . however, differences to t. cruzi ts were identified at three positions .  at position  <dig> all t. congolense ts <dig> variants have an alanine, like in t. brucei ts, replacing a proline occurring in t. cruzi ts ;  y <dig> of all t. congolense ts <dig> variants corresponds to a tryptophan in t. cruzi ts  and t. brucei ts;  the group of g <dig>  g <dig> and q <dig> replaces a tyrosine  in t. cruzi ts. in addition, near the catalytic site at position  <dig>  in t. congolense ts <dig> variants, a serine or valine occurs instead of arginine  in t. cruzi ts. interestingly, similar differences occur also in t. brucei ts . since these amino acids are close to the active site, they could influence the acceptor binding specificity. the arginine at position  <dig>  is conserved in all ts, with the exception of t. congolense ts1g, where it is a cysteine.

in figure 4b the amino acid positions are highlighted, which have different side chains in ts1a-ts1j . it should be noted that these are all on the same side of the protein as the catalytic site. striking is a cluster of amino acid variations in the lectin domain  suggesting that these changes may influence substrate binding of larger substrate molecules, such as glycoproteins.

characterization of t. congolense ts <dig> enzyme activity
all eleven ts <dig> gene products  were expressed as recombinant proteins and were recognized by the anti- t. congolense ts antibody   <cit>  . for all ts <dig> variants similar robust ts activity could be determined, except for ts1g. this variant, which carries cysteine instead of arginine at position  <dig>  had only very low ts activity. however, in contrast to the other variants, ts1g released free sia from fetuin at about 50% of the transfer to lactose. two of the t. congolense ts <dig> variants, ts1b and ts <dig> e- <dig>  were further characterized. they differ in eleven of the total  <dig> positions with amino acid variations listed in figure  <dig>  three in the catalytic domain and eight in the lectin domain.

the donor substrates fetuin 3'sl or pnp-neu5ac and the acceptor substrates lactose, galactose or gal-mu were employed to determine sialidase and trans-sialidase activities. for this purpose, a new assay was established as described under methods, using hpaec-pad to quantify sialylated oligosaccharide products with the detection limit of  <dig> pmol 3'sl corresponding to  <dig>  μm in the reaction mixture. in standard assays,  <dig> μl ts reactions were set up with  <dig> ng ts1b or ts <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> μg fetuin  as donor substrate and  <dig> nmol acceptor substrate . under these conditions, linear product formation was obtained for up to  <dig> pmol corresponding to  <dig> μm 3'sl .

if lactose is used as a donor substrate under standard conditions, 3'sl concentration increases linearly for about  <dig> minutes before the reaction velocity started to decrease . it should be noted that lactose was sialylated almost twice as fast by ts1b than by ts <dig> e- <dig>  in contrast to lactose, galactose was sialylated at the same rate by both enzymes, but at about 20-fold lower velocity than lactose.

different specific activities were obtained for t. congolense ts1b, ts <dig> e- <dig> and t. cruzi ts . the reaction velocity was linearly dependent on the amount of ts as long as the concentration of the product 3'sl was below  <dig> μm. under standard conditions  <dig> μm 3'sl was produced in  <dig> minutes with  <dig> ng ts. if  <dig> ng ts or more were used, product formation was independent of the amount of ts, probably due to the increased use of 3'sl as a donor substrate in the reverse reaction, finally leading to an equilibrium between lactose, 3'sl, sialylated and desialylated glycans on fetuin. this equilibrium apparently was reached in  <dig> minutes with  <dig> ng ts . after  <dig> h incubation,  <dig> ng ts was sufficient to reach the equilibrium. independent of the amount of enzyme used, for all three ts applied similar final concentrations of 3'sl were obtained after  <dig> h incubation .

neu5ac and 3'sl produced by ts after  <dig> h incubation under standard conditions were determined as described under material and methods. data points are means ± standard deviations of three replicates.

the hpaec-pad method used allowed not only determining the ts, but also sa activity, since free sia and 3' sl could be quantified from the same chromatogram. in standard reactions  no sa activity could be detected, both in the presence or absence of lactose as an acceptor substrate. this suggests that these ts <dig> variants usually need an acceptor substrate like lactose to cleave sia from a donor substrate. however, after  <dig> h incubation, free sia was detected. the quantity of sia released was dependent on the amount of ts used . besides standard ts reactions with fetuin as donor and lactose as acceptor substrate, ts reactions with  <dig> mm 3'sl as donor and  <dig> mg/ml asf as acceptor substrate were performed. in these reactions, free sia was detected after short reaction times and after incubation for  <dig> h,  <dig> - <dig> mm free sia were produced .

for kinetic experiments, assays were incubated for  <dig> minutes using  <dig> ng ts, since under these conditions 3'sl production was linear for all three ts. to determine the kinetic parameters for the acceptor substrates lactose  or gal-mu ,  <dig> μg fetuin  was used as donor substrate. the lowest km for lactose was found for t. cruzi ts with  <dig> μm compared to  <dig> μm for ts1b and  <dig> μm for ts <dig> e- <dig> . furthermore, t. cruzi ts was able to produce twice more 3'sl than ts1b and fourfold more than ts <dig> e- <dig> under these conditions.

km and vmax were calculated from michaelis-menten kinetics  by sigmaplot. data points are means ± standard deviations of three replicates. × approximately  <dig> nmol sia per  <dig> μg fetuin. abbr.: n.d.: not determined.

to determine the kinetic parameters for the donor substrate fetuin ,  <dig> mm lactose was used as acceptor substrate. both t. congolense ts <dig> had similar vmax-values, whereas the vmax for t. cruzi ts was about fivefold higher. different to the km of lactose, the lowest km for fetuin was exhibited by ts1b with  <dig> μm, which is about fivefold lower compared to ts <dig> e- <dig> with  <dig> μm and about 12-fold lower compared to t. cruzi ts with  <dig> μm.

kinetic studies with ts were also performed for the acceptor substrate gal-mu  and the donor substrate pnp-neu5ac. almost similar km and vmax-values were found for both t. congolense ts <dig>  the substrate pnp-neu5ac was only weakly used as a donor substrate by all three ts species. therefore, no reliable kinetic parameters could be determined.

sialylation pattern of glycopeptides
structural differences between ts <dig> variants may influence the enzymes preference for glycans on glycoproteins, such as fetuin. this could possibly result in different sialylation patterns on glycoproteins after incubation with ts. fetuin contains  <dig> n-glycosylation sites and  <dig> o-glycans, which all can serve as sia donors in ts reactions  <cit> . to investigate the specificity of ts towards different n-glycans on fetuin, we used maldi-tof-ms to determine the sialylation pattern of glycopeptides  from trypsin-digested fetuin after incubation with ts and lactose .

the sialylation patterns of three glycopeptides, gp 127- <dig> , and gp 54- <dig>  were determined. all  <dig> potential sialylation variants of these glycopeptides could be identified unambiguously and quantified from the maldi-tof-ms spectra. in untreated fetuin most branches on the three n-glycans investigated were sialylated, whereas upon treatment with ts and lactose after  <dig> minutes a clear shift towards incompletely sialylated glycans was observed. after  <dig> h ts incubation the relative amounts of unsialylated glycans was further increased and monosialylated glycans represented the most prominent species on both, di- and tribranched glycans .

sialylation of glycoproteins
as described above, t. congolense ts1b and ts <dig> e- <dig> readily used fetuin as donor substrate for the production of 3'sl. however, long-term ts reactions or experiments with higher amounts of ts had suggested that the reverse reaction also takes place. therefore, we investigated whether t. congolense ts1b and ts <dig> e- <dig> can restore sialylated glycans on vibrio cholerae sialidase-treated fetuin  as model glycoprotein. resialylation experiments were performed with  <dig> μg asf as acceptor and  <dig> nmol 3'sl as donor substrate as well as  <dig> ng ts <dig> in  <dig> μl to start the ts reaction and were incubated up to  <dig> h. this resialylation partially reversed the shift in electrophoretic mobility in sds-page observed for sialidase-treated fetuin . also by maldi-ms of glycopeptides, the sialylation of unsialylated glycans was confirmed .

furthermore, we addressed the question of whether through this reaction recognition sites for siglecs can be restored. for this purpose, ts-treated asf was immobilized to a microtitre plate and used as target for siglec- <dig>  which preferentially binds α <dig> -linked sia. under these conditions robust siglec- <dig> binding was observed of asf that had been treated with ts for  <dig> h. a prolonged  ts reaction only led to little further increase reaching 40% of binding levels observed with native fetuin .

discussion
in  <dig> tiralongo et al. published a partial sequence for t. congolense ts <dig>  <cit> . our approach to obtain the full length sequence of ts <dig> led to the discovery of  <dig> variants of this gene with an overall sequence identity of  <dig> % in the genome of this parasite. the previously published partial ts <dig> sequence, which had been assembled from  <dig> independent pcr reactions, turned out to represent a mixture of fragments from the  <dig> ts <dig> forms identified in this study. therefore, it is likely that that sequence doesn't exist in nature.

similar ts-like gene families occur also in other trypanosomes. in t. brucei the situation appears to be less complex, since only  <dig> ts closely related genes have been identified  <cit>  and these differences lead to  <dig> amino acid mutations. the largest ts gene family has been found in t. cruzi. its  <dig> members fall into three different groups  <cit> . blood stream trypomastigotes express two of these groups, one with ts activity and the other only with lectin activity. a third group has ts activity and is expressed by epimastigotes. at present it is unknown whether the expression of the different ts genes in african trypanosomes is also stage-dependent.

t. congolense ts <dig> shares about 57% identical amino acids with t. brucei ts and 48% sequence identity with t. cruzi ts. by comparison, the american t. rangeli sa and t. cruzi ts are more closely related with approximately 70% sequence identity  <cit> .

the homology model for t. congolense ts <dig> based on crystal structures from t.cruzi ts and t. rangeli sa provided  insight in differences in the active site and its surrounding between ts from these parasites and  revealed the spatial distribution of the amino acid differences between the ts <dig> variants.

compared to t. cruzi ts only three amino acids are changed in ts <dig> . at position  <dig> a proline at the corresponding position of t. cruzi ts appears to be relevant for full ts activity  <cit> . however, in both, t. brucei ts and in t. congolense ts <dig>  position  <dig> is an alanine. tiralongo et al.,  postulated a <dig> might be common to african trypanosomes and does not seem to have an effect on enzymatic activity  <cit> . our data have demonstrated that an alanine at this position is well compatible with ts activity, since all active ts <dig> variants have a <dig>  the exchanges at  <dig> and  <dig> may be relevant for the different substrate specificities of ts species, since this area possibly participates in the interaction with the underlying galactose.

with the full length coding sequence of ts <dig> available, the enzymes were expressed and characterized as recombinant proteins to address the question of whether ts <dig> accounts for the ts activity in the two preparations  from procyclic parasite cultures  <cit> . the amino acid sequences of the eleven ts <dig> variants described here contain the peptide vvdptvvak present in ts-form  <dig>  furthermore, all recombinant ts <dig> variants reacted with the anti-t. congolense ts antibody   <cit> . based on this information, it is now clear that ts <dig> was present in both, ts-form <dig> and ts-form  <dig>  however, two observations made with recombinant ts <dig> suggest that the native enzyme preparations of ts-form  <dig> and even more for ts-form  <dig> contained additional ts1-like proteins.  the reaction velocities with the synthetic substrates pnp-neu5ac  and gal-mu  were much lower than with fetuin and lactose for all three ts. tiralongo et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  determined a km of  <dig> μm for gal-mu, which is approximately 10-fold higher than for ts1b  and ts <dig> e- <dig> . these differences could be due to the presence of other ts1-like enzymes in the preparations of ts-form  <dig> and ts-form  <dig>   using the substrate neu5ac-mu no sa or ts activity could be detected for the t. congolense ts <dig> variants investigated here, whereas cleavage of this substrate indicated sa activity in preparations of ts-form  <dig> and ts-form  <dig>  <cit> , as well as ts activity in procyclic parasites  <cit> . also this apparent discrepancy can easily be explained by the presence of other ts1-like enzymes accepting neu5ac-mu as ts or sa substrate.

ten of the eleven recombinant ts <dig> variants revealed ts activity, which is in agreement with the ts-form  <dig> purified by tiralongo et al.  <cit> . only ts1g, which carries a cysteine at position  <dig> instead of an arginine, showed very low ts but clear sa activity. this suggests that r <dig> is important but not essential for the transfer reaction and hinders sa activity in t. congolense ts <dig>  in a previous study on t. rangeli sa  <cit>  r <dig> has been postulated to form a hydrogen bond to the o <dig> of sia. however, it remains unclear how this could relate to ts activity. furthermore, the homology model of ts <dig> does not provide evidence for such a hydrogen bond for the binding site of t. congolense ts <dig> 

the ts <dig> homology model  displays also the position of amino acid exchanges in the eleven ts <dig> forms identified. it could be speculated that these positions are relevant determinants of antigenic sites and that these variations help to escape recognition by the immune system. however, if ts <dig> is expressed in the procyclic form in the insect vector, this is unlikely to be relevant. interestingly, these exchanges are located on the same side of the protein where substrate binding occurs, which opens the possibility that these changes influence the binding specificities. the cluster of changes from position  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> could be involved in recognition of larger substrate molecules, such as glycoproteins. positions,  <dig> and  <dig> , as well as positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are closer to the active site in the catalytic domain, possibly contributing to interactions with substrates. it should be noted that the six amino acid differences occurring in t. brucei ts are not found in clusters like in t. congolense ts <dig>  and furthermore, they are not even on the same side of the protein.

for a more detailed characterization of their differences in activity, we choose two ts <dig> variants, ts1b and ts <dig> e- <dig>  the two amino acid sequences of ts1b and ts <dig> e- <dig> differ mainly in the lectin domain , whereby the exchange from e <dig> in ts1b to k <dig> in ts <dig> e- <dig> represents the most drastic change.

the observation that lactose is a much better acceptor substrate than gal is in agreement with previously reported relative transfer activity data for the preparations ts-form  <dig> and ts-form  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, with fetuin as donor substrate t. cruzi ts, t. congolense ts1b and ts <dig> e- <dig> produced different amounts of 3'sl in  <dig> minutes under identical conditions. it is likely that these differences are due to distinct substrate specificities for the sialoglycans of fetuin. however, after  <dig> h, equilibriums for the reactions were attained and the three ts applied produced almost the same amounts of 3'sl. most likely this reflects a similar equilibrium for these three ts.

clear differences were found in the kinetic parameters of ts1b and ts <dig> e- <dig> for lactose and fetuin. reliable kinetic parameter for 3'sl as donor substrate could not be determined, because of the inaccurate quantification of the high concentrations of 3'sl as donor substrate. whereas ts1b has a slightly higher km  for lactose compared to ts <dig> e- <dig> , the opposite and more pronounced difference was observed for fetuin-bound sia, where ts <dig> e- <dig> has approximately fivefold higher km  compared to ts1b . in combination, this implies that the ratio of km for lactose/km for fetuin-bound sia is approximately  <dig> for ts1b, whereas it is only  <dig> for ts <dig> e- <dig>  by comparison, for t. cruzi ts the km for both substrates is quite similar  and its vmax was fourfold higher than for the ts <dig> isoforms. the differences in the kinetic parameters for fetuin observed for ts1b and ts <dig> e- <dig> are possibly related to altered affinities resulting from amino acid divergences in the lectin domain of ts1b and ts <dig> e- <dig>  this would suggest a mechanism linking the lectin domain to the enzymatic properties of ts.

no release of free sia could be detected after  <dig> minutes of ts reactions with fetuin as donor and lactose as acceptor substrates, demonstrating the absence of sa activity. however, after  <dig> h incubation, free sia was detected clearly indicating sa activity. this activity correlated with the ts amount present, implying sa activity to be a side reaction observable only in extended reactions. interestingly, in the reverse ts reactions with 3'sl as donor substrate for sialylation of galactose residues of asf, free sia is detected very early in the reaction . this suggests that the free sia detected in extended ts reactions times with fetuin as donor substrate is mainly the product of a sa side activity of the reaction using 3'sl as substrate. therefore, the amount of free sia could provide indirect information on the velocity of the reverse reaction. this assumption is further supported by the fact that lower amounts of ts can led to the same amount of final 3'sl but produce less free sia as side product . in this context it should be noted, that ts from t. cruzi clearly produced more free sia than t. congolense ts1b or ts <dig> e- <dig>  the structural basis for this phenomenon is unclear but may be related to the kinetics of the reaction. ts have been reported to follow ping-pong bi bi kinetics  <cit> . it will be interesting to investigate the structure-function relationship of this phenomenon and whether this is related to the sa activity of ts1g.

the ts substrate specificities for the glycans of the donor substrate fetuin were investigated by a maldi-tof analysis of ts treated glycopeptides from trypsin digested fetuin, since the glycosylation of fetuin is well established  <cit> . three glycopeptides coming from two of the three n-glycosylation sites  could be analyzed reliably. the predicted masses of gp 142- <dig> di could not be identified in any spectra. gp 54- <dig> di and gp 142- <dig> tri differed only in one da, which were not resolved by the equipment available and were excluded from the analysis. the peptide containing the three o-glycosylation sites could not be detected due to its high mass. but it is important to note, that ts <dig> clearly utilizes sialylated o-glycans as donor substrates as indicated by a rapid unmasking of peanut agglutinin recognition sites .

only minor differences in the sialylation pattern of fetuin gps were observed using the different ts species. in summary, these were too small to draw a conclusion that these ts differ in their substrate specificities for fetuin glycans. in general, the ts applied cleaved sia from n-glycans of glycopeptides investigated, but also transferred sia back to these n-glycans. n-glycans that carried three and four sia molecules in the case of the tribranched n-glycans as well as n-glycans that carried two sia molecules in the case of dibranched n-glycans before ts incubation, were reduced to predominantly 0- <dig> sia molecules in the case of tribranched and 0- <dig> sia molecule in the case of dibranched n-glycans after  <dig> h ts incubation.

whereas in the reactions discussed above sia was transferred from fetuin to synthesize 3'sl, we could also show that t. congolense ts <dig> as well as t. cruzi ts transfer sia in the reverse direction from 3'sl to glycoproteins. furthermore, the ts reaction restores binding of sia-binding proteins, such as siglec- <dig>  due to the reversibility of the reaction, a complete resialylation of an acceptor substrate applying ts cannot be expected under these conditions. nevertheless, differences in the kinetic parameters as shown for two of the eleven t. congolense ts <dig> variants could be used in kinetically controlled reactions to optimize the ts reaction to one or the other product, making the ts <dig> variants interesting tools for biotechnological applications. thus, ts <dig> can be utilized to transfer sia in α <dig> -linkage on biologically relevant glycoproteins containing terminal galactose as sia acceptor.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, full length ts from the african parasite t. congolense has been cloned and sequenced, opening new perspectives for investigations on the biological role of these enzymes in the pursuit of a cure for nagana and sleeping sickness. eleven t. congolense ts <dig> variants were identified and expressed as recombinant proteins. the eleven ts <dig> differ in  <dig> of  <dig> amino acid positions and a structural model revealed that these variations occur in three clusters on the side of the protein that is open to substrate binding. ten of these ts <dig> variants share predominantly ts and little sa activity. only one, ts1g, has much lower ts but increased sa activity, probably due to an exchange of an arginine to a cysteine at position  <dig>  interestingly, the kinetic parameters of two characterized ts <dig> variants reveal subtle differences in substrate specificities. however, these did not lead to major differences in the sialylation pattern of n-glycans on fetuin after treatment with different ts variants. finally a proof of principle has been provided that these ts can be used to sialylate glycoconjugates to create binding sites for sia-binding proteins like siglec- <dig> 

it will be interesting to investigate the expression patterns of ts <dig> variants in the parasite's life cycle in future investigations addressing their importance for the manifestation of midgut colonization and maturation in the tsetse vector with possible implications for the transmission to the mammalian host.
