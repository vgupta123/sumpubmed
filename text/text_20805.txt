BACKGROUND
wax gourd  cogn, 2n = 2x = 24) is a monotypic genus, which belongs to cucurbitaceae and is a widely distributed vegetable in india, china and many other tropical countries  <cit> . it is also called white gourd, white pumpkin, tallow gourd, and so on, which is named after an italian count, giuseppe benincasa  <cit> . fruit is its main consumption organ, and often consumed as baked, fried, boiled, pickled and candied/preserved. the storage of wax gourd is quite long, which makes it play a significant role in ensuring the annual supply and regulating off-seasons of vegetables. besides, it is also recommended for treatment of peptic ulcer, hemorrhages from internal organs, epilepsy and other neurological disorders  <cit> . previous study also showed that its fresh juice is effective in preventing morphine withdrawal in mice  <cit> . in spite of its economic importance, no genetic map has been constructed in wax gourd, which hinders the map-based cloning of important horticultural genes.

high-density genetic maps are particularly valuable tools in many genetic and genomic applications, especially for gene fine mapping and map-based gene cloning. one key prerequisite for high-density genetic map construction is the available of a large number of polymorphic markers. in wax gourd, only conventional markers such as random amplified polymorphic dna  and simple sequence repeats  could be available and had been used in genetic analysis  <cit> . and recently, we have carried out transcriptome sequencing and developed thousands of ssr markers in wax  <cit> . because of the narrow genetic base, no genetic map has been constructed in wax gourd. besides, the genome size of wax gourd reaches up to 800 mb , which is much bigger than any of the known species in cucurbits, such as cucumber , melon , watermelon  . consequently, the existing markers make it impossible for constructing high-density genetic map. snp  is more useful than other conventional markers, because it is the most abundant and stabile type of genetic variation in most genomes . however, the difficulty is the development of a large number of snp markers, which limits the application of this kind of markers.

fortunately, with the development of biotechnology, the next-generation sequencing  technology makes it feasible for large scale snp marker discovery. reduced representation genome sequencing  is a rapid and cost-effective strategy for high-throughput identification and genotyping of snps  <cit> . this sequencing method reduces the genome complexity by only sequencing the dna fragments with restriction sites. accompanying with the extensive application of ngs technology, several rrgs methods have been developed  <cit> . slaf-seq is a recently developed method which is a low cost but efficient high-throughput sequence-based technique and reduces the complexity of high-quality reference genome libraries  <cit> . this technology exhibits significant advantages in high-throughput snp marker discovery and genotyping for constructing genetic map. it has been employed for high-density genetic map construction in many species, such as common carp  <cit> , sesame  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , mei  <cit>  and cucumber  <cit> .

since slaf-seq technique does not depend on reference genome sequence, it is particularly important for species with unknown genome, including wax gourd. in the current study, the slaf-seq technique was employed to construct an snp-based genetic map for wax gourd, which contained  <dig> linkage groups and  <dig>  snp markers, and spanned  <dig> .86 cm with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. in addition, to text the utility of this genetic map, fine mapping of pericarp color trait was detected. this is the first report of genetic map construction in wax gourd.

RESULTS
slaf sequencing and genotyping
after slaf library construction and high-throughput sequencing,  <dig>  m pair-end reads was obtained with a length of 100 bp. the guanine-cytosine  content as  <dig>  % and q <dig> ratio  was  <dig>  %. in the maternal line ,  <dig> , <dig> reads and  <dig>  slafs with an average coverage of  <dig>  were generated. in the parental line , the number of reads and slafs were  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , respectively, with an average depth of  <dig>  for each slaf. for f <dig> population,  <dig>  to  <dig>  slafs were produced from  <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig> reads, with the coverage ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . and the average number of reads per individual was  <dig> , <dig>  with an average depth of  <dig>  . the average number of slafs was  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> number of markers and average sequencing depths of f <dig> population. the x-axes in both a and b indicate the f <dig> individuals. the y-axe in a indicates marker coverage, and the y-axe in b indicates the number of markers developed for each f <dig> plant



after filtering low-depth slaf tags, a total of  <dig>  high-quality slafs were detected and  <dig>  of them were polymorphic, with a polymorphism rate of  <dig>  % . the polymorphic slafs were further screened to filter out unsuitable markers for genetic construction. finally, of the  <dig>  polymorphic slafs,  <dig>  were classified into eight segregation patterns  following a genotype encoding rule . since the two parents  are homozygous wax gourd lines with genotypes of aa and bb,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  polymorphic slafs with aa × bb segregation pattern were selected for linkage map construction . after filtering the low quality slafs with parental sequence depth less than 10×, completeness less than 70 % and significant segregation distortion ,  <dig>  markers were finally selected for genetic map construction.fig.  <dig> number of slaf markers in each of eight segregation patterns



high-throughput linkage map construction
after linkage analysis by using joinmap  <dig>  , the  <dig>  markers were mapped on twelve linkage groups  . the integrity of the mapped markers ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %, with an average of  <dig> , which indicated a relatively high map quality . detailed information of this genetic map is presented in additional file  <dig> and table  <dig> table  <dig> basic information of wax gourd genetic map

the map spanned a total of  <dig> .86 cm with an average marker distance of  <dig>  cm. the largest lg was lg <dig>  which contained  <dig> slaf markers. and the smallest lg <dig> only contained  <dig> markers. on average, each lg had  <dig> slaf markers. the genetic distances of the  <dig> lgs ranged  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , with the average marker distance spanned from  <dig>  c  to  <dig>  cm  . besides, the max gap of the  <dig> lgs ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm  .

evaluation of the genetic map
to evaluate the quality of the newly constructed map, haplotype map and heat map were employed. haplotype map reflects the double crossover of the population, which suggests the errors of genotyping. haplotype maps, which intuitively displayed the recombination events of each individual, were generated for each of the f <dig> population and for the parental controls using  <dig>  slaf markers as described by west et al.  <cit>  . most of the recombination blocks were clearly defined. in a linkage group, the percentage of double crossover is usually less than 3 %. in our present study, the percentage of double crossover of all the linkage groups is less than  <dig>  % .table  <dig> the double crossover and missing percent of all the linkage groups



heat maps were also generated by using pair-wise recombination values for the  <dig>  slaf markers . since the heat map reflects the relationship of recombination between markers from one single linkage group, thus it was used to find potential ordering errors of markers. the result showed that the slaf markers in most lgs were well ordered.

inheritance and mapping of pericarp color
six generations  were employed to study the inheritance of pericarp color. it could be easily identified on the mature fruit stage, which is yellow in p <dig>  and dark green in p <dig> . the pericarp color of all the f <dig> and bc <dig> plants was dark green, which indicated the dominant nature of dark green to yellow. among the 219 f <dig> plants,  <dig> had fruits with dark green pericarp color and  <dig> with yellow pericarp color  . furthermore, for  <dig> bc <dig> plants,  <dig> of them had dark green fruit, while the remaining had yellow fruit . these results indicated that the pericarp color was controlled by one single gene, with dark green dominant to yellow. herein, this gene was designated as pc.fig.  <dig> partial fruits of f <dig> populations



based on the high-density genetic map and phenotypic character, the pericarp color locus was performed by joinmap  <dig>  with the kosambi mapping function. threshold of significance  for each marker after  <dig>  permutation was set to  <dig> , which identified a single locus at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig> . on this linkage group,  <dig> markers  were found to be linked to pc locus. the genetic distance of markers in the flanking regions of pc was  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively . and the estimated proportion of phenotypic variance explained  by marker <dig> and marker <dig> was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively.fig.  <dig> gene mapping of pericarp color



discussion
high-density genetic maps play an important role in fine mapping and map-based gene cloning  <cit> . but up to recently, no genetic map has been constructed in wax gourd, although it has great economic and medicinal value. the construction of genetic map depends on efficient markers. however, the genome size of wax gourd is relatively large when compared to other species in cucurbits, and the genomic information is lack, which hinder specific markers development. currently, only conventional markers  and a small amounts of ssr markers can be available in wax gourd . besides, the genetic diversity among wax gourd germplasm resources is low. the narrow genetic base results in a very low polymorphism for the existing markers, which makes it impossible to construct a high-density genetic map in wax gourd. consequently, in order to develop high-density markers for genetic map construction, we must hunt for a more effective method.

with the rapid development of sequencing technology, ngs-based methods provide an excellent chance for high-throughput marker discovery and genotyping, which has been successfully applied in many species  <cit> . slaf-seq strategy is one of the newly developed methods for large-scale snp discovery and genotyping using high-throughput sequence  <cit> . this method combines locus-specific amplification and high-throughput sequencing, and has been applied successfully in many plants . as an example in sesame, zhang et al.  <cit>  constructed the first high-density genetic map by slaf sequencing. in cucumber, two saturated genetic map were generated by using slaf-seq technology, and qtl analysis of fruit-related traits were also conducted  <cit> .

when compared with other methods for marker development, the slaf-seq strategy had several significant advantages, such as uniform, accuracy, stability, high success rate, and low cost. furthermore, reference genome sequences or reference snps were not necessary for this method  <cit> . consequently, slaf-seq is an ideal strategy for large-scale marker developing and genotyping for species which is lack of reference genome information, such as wax gourd. in the present study, we firstly employed slaf sequencing technology in wax gourd. in total,  <dig>  m pair-end reads and  <dig>  high-quality slafs were generated. after filtering low-depth slaf tags,  <dig>  of high-quality slafs were polymorphic, with a polymorphism rate of  <dig>  %. eventually,  <dig>  polymorphic markers were identified for constructing genetic map, which contained  <dig> lgs, with the number of markers ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the map spanned  <dig> .86 cm with an average marker distance of  <dig>  cm. in order to evaluate the quality the genetic map, haplotype map and heat map were applied. the result showed that the slaf markers in most lgs were well ordered, which implied that the quality of markers fulfilled the requirements for genetic map construction. besides, marker integrity and accuracy were high. the above results also accurately reflect the genetic and polymorphism characteristics of wax gourd.

pericarp color is an important trait for fruit commodity value, which has been studied in many species. cheng et al.  <cit>  investigated the inheritance of apple fruit skin color and identified dna markers linked to the gene for this trait. and two allelic r2r <dig> myb genes mdmyba and mdmyb <dig> were isolated from a pale-red skinned apple cultivar and a red skinned apple cultivar, respectively  <cit> . in japanese pear, a major qtl associated with fruit skin color was identified at the top of lg <dig>  <cit> . the skin color in sweet cherry fruit was also reported, which identified a qtl on lg <dig>  <cit> . huh et al.  <cit>  identified a candidate gene, which may be responsible for discriminating red and orange pepper. in cucurbitaceae, the mature fruit color of cucumber is controlled by one single gene, which has been fine mapped on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

in this study, we researched the genetic inheritance of pericarp color by using  <dig> generations of wax gourd, which showed that the pericarp color was controlled by one single gene, with dark green dominant to yellow. and we also conducted gene mapping analysis using the high-density genetic map. we identified a single locus on lg <dig>  and the genetic distance of the flanking markers of pc locus was  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively . furthermore, the estimated pve contribution rate by these two markers was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. these results indicate that the high-density genetic map developed in this study can be successfully employed for gene mapping.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we generated  <dig>  m pair-end reads and  <dig>  high-quality slafs using slaf sequencing. a high quality genetic map was constructed based on  <dig>  markers. the genetic length of this map was  <dig> .86 cm, with an average marker distance of  <dig>  cm. haplotype map and heat map were employed to evaluate the quality of this genetic map. based on haplotype map, the percentage of double crossover of all the linkage groups was under  <dig>  %. and the heat map showed the slaf markers in most lgs were in well order. in addition, we analyzed the inheritance of pericarp color, which showed that the pericarp color was controlled by one single gene. we further applied the newly constructed map to identify a single locus on chromosome  <dig> for controlling the pericarp color. to the best of our knowledge, both the genetic map construction and gene mapping of pericarp color are the first reports in wax gourd. the high-density map constructed herein will be served as a valuable tool for gene mapping, marker assisted breeding, map-based gene cloning, comparative mapping and draft genome assembling in wax gourd.
