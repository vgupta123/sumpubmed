BACKGROUND
despite the increased sophistication of annotation tools, a significant number of protein sequences emerging from genome sequencing efforts continue to remain in the realm of "hypothetical proteins" with little or no functional annotation associated with them. ultimately, a definite functional annotation would require experimental characterization, which is often time consuming and expensive. careful remote homology detection and manual analysis has in many occasions helped to glean useful structural and functional insights into these so-called "hypothetical proteins". typically, such studies involve a combination of profile based methods like transitive psi-blast  <cit> , compass  <cit>  and hmmer  <cit>  as well as structure prediction and fold recognition methods  <cit> .

one such study  <cit>  had analyzed sequences of the ubiquitously found protein modules homologous to the nitrogen regulatory pii proteins as defined in the cog  <cit>  and pfam databases  <cit> . this comprehensive analysis expanded the pii protein superfamily to include five very divergent groups of proteins, with below random  pairwise sequence identities between some members of distant groups. nevertheless, each group has distinct patches of conserved local similarities and was predicted to retain the same overall structural fold as pii and a trimeric structure essential for ligand-binding site formation. the pii-like proteins are small protein modules of ferredoxin-like fold containing a core  <dig> secondary structural pattern, and function as trimers. while the nitrogen regulatory pii proteins that belong to the group ii of the superfamily have been studied extensively  <cit> , the functions of other groups in the superfamily are either poorly understood or completely unknown. one group of pii-like proteins, group iii, is significantly larger  than a typical pii protein domain . in these proteins, the pii domain is embedded within the central region of the polypeptide while the n- and c-terminal regions together belong to the nif <dig> -like protein family. presumably, the pii domain of these proteins would play some sort of ligand binding and signalling role analogous to that of classical pii proteins  <cit> , while the function of the nif3-like domains is not known.

we chose the group iii proteins of the pii superfamily  for structure determination with two primary objectives: to structurally characterize both the group iii pii-like domain and nif <dig> domains which may provide clues to their potential function that is otherwise unattainable from sequence information alone. apart from providing confirmation of our prediction of the central p-ii domain, the structure of sa <dig> would also be important for functional analysis of the nif <dig> domains, which were recently highlighted in the top  <dig> list of important structural targets due to their broad phylogenetic distribution, sequence conservation patterns with putative "active-site like" features and their uncharacterized role as a putative regulatory molecules of eukaryotic transcription  <cit> .

RESULTS
description of sa <dig> monomer
the final model of sa <dig>  refined to  <dig> Å resolution consists of two subunits in the asymmetric unit. one subunit is traceable across the entire length of polypeptide from the n- to the c-terminus  with the exception of a loop region containing  <dig> residues  in the central pii domain. in the other monomer, several more residues are disordered . a ribbon representation of one sa <dig> monomers is shown in figure 1a.

overall, the protein is organized into three distinct structural domains with interconnecting topological connectivities . the two nif <dig> domains at the n- and c-terminus of the protein  have the same overall fold as canonical nif3-like proteins  <cit> , with a central  <dig> stranded mixed β-sheet and a pair of helices on either side. nif3-n and nif3-c are structurally similar and are clearly superimposable as shown in figure 1c, and therefore are probably a result of gene duplication.

the middle region of the polypeptide  bulges out between the two nif <dig> domains and is structured as a classical pii-like fold with a  <dig> architecture , confirming our earlier prediction  <cit> . this domain is relatively well ordered only in one of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit. in this monomer, although all the secondary structural elements are well defined, we do not observe electron density for residues 169– <dig> that connects the strands β <dig> and β <dig>  in the other monomer, in addition to this loop, helix α <dig> and strand β <dig> are also disordered. residues in this domain have substantially higher b factors, indicating a higher mobility compared to the rest of the protein.

structure comparison with other nif <dig> and pii proteins
structure comparison of the entire polypeptide of sa <dig> as well as the nif <dig> domains using dali  <cit>  clearly identified two nif <dig> homologous proteins, e. coli ybgi  and sp <dig> from streptococcus pneumoniae . these two nif <dig> homologs share sequence identities of 23% and 32%, respectively, with sa <dig> sequence with the central pii-like domain  excluded. a superimposition of the three structures is shown in figure 2a. both ybgi and sp <dig> proteins have the same secondary structural connectivities as sa <dig>  however, unlike sa <dig>  these two proteins lack the middle pii-like domain.

the pii-like domain of sa <dig> is topologically identical to several pii proteins with characterized structures , such as glnb  <cit>  and glnk  <cit> , as well as pii-like protein cuta  <cit>  and the c-terminal regulatory domain of atp phosphoribosyltransferase   <cit> . this domain has a core  <dig> secondary structural pattern described in scop as a ferredoxin-like fold  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether the sa <dig> pii domain binds atp or other ligands either in vivo or in vitro.

the nif <dig> domains are involved in dimerization
the two sa <dig> monomers in the asymmetric unit tightly associate to form a dimer along the sides of the two nif <dig> domains opposite to where the pii-domain is located. the two subunits are arranged in a head-to-tail manner with the nif3-n of one subunit facing nif3-c of the adjacent subunit, while the nif3-c of the same subunit is nested in an elbow-like area between the two nif <dig> domains of the second monomer. about  <dig> Å <dig>  or ~10% of the total surface area per monomer is buried in a largely hydrophobic  interface . there are also a few specific hydrogen bond interactions, including those between the side chains of asp44-a and his308-b, tyr80-a and asp313-b, as well as that between the side chain of asp305-a and main chain amide of his <dig>  there is no salt bridge in the dimer interface. additionally, the last β-strand  of one monomer is part of the β-sheet of the other monomer , with four main chain hydrogen bonds formed between the two adjacent β-strands from different monomers.

the pii-like domains are involved in trimerization
the pii-like domain juts out of the dimer on the side opposite the dimer interface and forms homotrimers by interacting with the pii-like domains of symmetry related molecules along the three-fold axes . the trimeric arrangement, where the individual β-sheets of each pii domain pack orthogonally is similar to that seen in several pii and pii-like proteins such as glnb  <cit> , glnk  <cit> , cuta  <cit>  and the c terminal regulatory domain of hisg among others. a superimposition of pii trimer of sa <dig> and that of atp bound complex of e. coli glnk is shown in figure 3c.

sa <dig> forms a capped toroidal hexamer
further analysis of symmetry mates within the rhombohedral unit cell showed that the individual subunits are organized into hexamers with a cage-like appearance . the two nif <dig> domains of each of the six monomers line the walls of this hollowed toroidal structure that has a central cavity of ~38Å diameter. the two nif <dig> homologs, e. coli ybgi and sp <dig> also assemble as hexamers in the crystals in a similar manner as that in sa <dig>  but their central cavity, which is of similar dimensions, is open at both ends. in sa <dig>  the two entries to the central hollow space are capped by the two pii domain trimers. however, this capping is not complete and leaves six smaller openings to the central cavity that are formed between the long stems connecting the pii-like domain and the nif <dig> domains . the triangle shaped openings have approximate dimensions of ~20Å . these openings render the inside of the sa <dig> hexamer solvent accessible and should allow access for small molecules to enter the putative active site . given the prevalent hexameric organization in all nif3-like protein structures available so far, it is quite certain that the functional unit of these proteins is a hexamer.

description of the putative active site
we observe clear electron density for two tightly bound metal ions at the junction of the two nif <dig> domains in each sa <dig> monomer close to the protein surface that face inside the hexameric toroid . the identity of the metal was determined to be zinc, first by an extended x-ray fluorescence scan at synchrotron and was further confirmed by inductively coupled plasma  atomic emission spectrometry. we have therefore modelled two zinc atoms at the putative active site. both metal atoms are tethered to the protein through several histidine and aspartate residues. residue glu <dig> is coordinated to both metal ions, while a water molecule, or more likely a hydroxide ion, also bridges the two metal ions. the configuration of this dinuclear metal center is very similar to that of the diiron site found in its e. coli homolog ybgi  <cit> , and is reminiscent of the dinuclear mu-oxo diiron sites found in hemerythrins  <cit> , ribonucleotide reductases  <cit>  and purple acid phosphatase  <cit> . some of the conserved residues at the metal center in the two structures along with that of sp <dig> are shown in figure 5a. the metal binding sites are remarkably similar in the three nif3-like protein structures  and consist primarily of five histidines, one glutamate and one aspartate. these residues are among the most conserved residues in the nif3-like protein superfamily.

additionally, we observe a clear electron density for a ligand of unknown identity in close proximity to the two bound zinc atoms that would provide two additional metal ligands, one to each of the two metal ions to complete the octahedral metal center configuration . by trial and error, we have ruled out all components in the crystallization solution that might have been inadvertently bound either during crystallization or during cryoprotection and therefore conclude that the observed ligand must in fact be an endogenously bound ligand that was co-purified after recombinant overexpression. the contours of the difference electron density map  after final refinement suggests the presence of a head group directly ligated to the metal ions and a mostly aliphatic tail that has few specific polar interactions with the surrounding protein residues . two aromatic residues, a tyrosine  and a tryptophan  lie in close proximity to the bound ligand and may be involved in ligand binding.

discussion
although homologs of both pii and nif <dig> proteins are found ubiquitously in all three kingdoms of life, the function of sa <dig> and its homologs that contain both pii-like and nif3-like domains remain completely unknown. the fusion of the two proteins in one peptide chain indicates a functional coupling of these two proteins. the structural features revealed in the present study, such as the cage-like hexameric toroid structure with its nif <dig> domains as walls and the two pii-like domain trimers as lids, the dinuclear metal site, and the intrinsically bound ligand, may provide certain clues of its potential function. the primary role of the nitrogen regulatory pii proteins is to integrate various intracellular carbon and nitrogen signals by regulating enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation  <cit> . pii exerts its regulatory effects by undergoing different post translational modifications, such as uridylylation  <cit>  and phosphorylation  <cit>  by various modifying enzymes in response to the primary cellular nitrogen signal glutamine. structures of several pii and pii-like proteins have been solved including glnb , glna , glnk , hisg , cuta <dig> , and a hypothetical protein from cog <dig>  effectors of pii include transcription factors  <cit> , signalling proteins e.g., histidine kinases  <cit> , and metabolic enzymes like glutamine synthase  <cit> . apart from its primary signalling modulator glutamine, pii proteins are known to bind a range of small molecule effectors such as atp, ump, and 2-ketoglutarate, which affects its function antagonistically to glutamine . it is highly likely that the trimeric pii domain of sa <dig> also plays a ligand induced signalling role and probably regulates the function of the nif3-like domains.

unlike pii domains, the nif3-like domains have only recently begun to be structurally characterized, and their structure-function relationship remains sketchy. nif3-like proteins are ubiquitously conserved from bacteria to higher eukaryotes  <cit> . they have been defined in uniprot database as the uncharacterized protein family upf <dig> that has  <dig> homologs  <cit> . several homologs of this family  have a similar overall three-domain organization as in sa <dig>  while others  have only the nif <dig> domains with the pii-like domain being absent. experiments on spermatogonia derived cell line gc- <dig> suggest that nif3l <dig>  gene, a homolog of sa <dig>  expresses copiously during embryonic development and participates in retinoic acid-primed neural differentiation by interacting with the transcriptional corepressor trip15/csn <dig>  <cit> . its primary role appears to be to inhibit ngg1p from translocation to the nucleus, presumably by forming a binary complex in the cytoplasm  <cit> . yeast two hybrid studies have shown that nif <dig> binds to the amino terminal region of ngg <dig>  an interaction that was implicated as a means of limiting transcriptional activation of gal4p in glucose rich medium  <cit> . furthermore, a genomewide two-hybrid analysis of yeast protein-protein interactions suggests that yeast nif3p interacts with a nuclear import/export protein  and a ras-like gtpase , which are both required for proper exit from mitosis in the cell cycle  <cit> . in e. coli, expression of nif <dig> homolog ybgi increases dramatically upon genotoxic stress induced by dna damage  <cit> . this observation might be significant in light of the structure reported here because proteins that have been implicated in processes involving dna metabolism often adopt toroidal structures  <cit> . however, the active site observed for sa <dig> in this study, along with that seen in ybgi are not similar to the previously characterized dna interacting toroids .

although the precise biochemical function of the nif3-like proteins are not known, the presence of a binuclear metal center similar to those found in hemerythrins, ribonucleotide reductases and purple acid phosphatase, as well as the endogenously bound ligand in the current structure strongly suggest that sa <dig> nif <dig> domains and e. coli ybgl proteins likely bind and perform some form of catalysis on small molecule ligands, possibly metabolic substrates, and whose function may be regulated by the pii-like domains. in an attempt to determine the chemical identity of the endogenous ligand, we have extracted the ligand from the purified protein by trichloroacetic acid /acetone precipitation. the preliminary high-resolution mass spectroscopic analysis of the tca/acetone extract suggested that the ligand might be a compound of novel chemical composition. crystallization of the compound has not been successful probably due to its intrinsic structural flexibility, which may not be susceptible for crystallization. alternative approaches, such as nmr spectroscopy, may be needed in order to determine the chemical formulas and three-dimensional structure of the endogenous ligand.

CONCLUSIONS
the recent upsurge in structures of a large number of hypothetical proteins by structural genomics efforts continue to provide important leads in the eventual determination of their function. this success has been largely due to either similarity of the overall structure, or local relatedness of catalytic residues to proteins of known function. proteins with novel, previously unknown folds however are often limited in providing functional clues because of lack of similarity to any experimentally characterized proteins. sometimes, the fortuitous observation of endogenously bound ligands offers important clues in this direction. the dinuclear metal center and the presence of a bound ligand at the active site of the nif <dig> domain of sa <dig> combined with the structural analysis of the two nif <dig> homologs, ybgi and sa <dig> should aid in the functional assignment of this widespread protein family.
