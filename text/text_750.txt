BACKGROUND
since the first small rna  – lin <dig> was discovered in c. elegans, identification of small endogenous non-coding rna  has received considerable attention. sncrnas include small interfering rna
 <cit> , mirna
 <cit>  and piwi-interacting rna, which all regulate genes at the post-transcriptional level
 <cit> . among these sncrnas, mirnas are small, non-coding 21– <dig> nt rna molecules that play an important role in regulating gene expression in animals and plants by promoting mrna degradation and inhibiting mrna translation
 <cit> . however, other studies revealed that some mirnas may also function to induce gene expression
 <cit> . many mirnas are evolutionary conserved in related species and some even show conservation between invertebrates and vertebrates
 <cit> . generally, the functions of mirnas are not limited to the regulation of developmentally timed events. instead, they have diverse expression patterns and probably regulate many aspects of development and physiology
 <cit> . to date, the mirbase database contains  <dig> mature mirna products from  <dig> mammalian species. recently, transcriptome profiling of mirnas has led to identification of novel mirnas, provided valuable information on tissue specific expression and evolutionary conservation across species, and served as a cornerstone for subsequent functional analyses.

in adult animals, both hair and skin color depend on pigment produced by melanocytes at the base of the epithelium
 <cit> . melanocytes in mammals and birds produce two types of melanin, black to brown eumelanin and yellow to reddish brown pheomelanin
 <cit> . the quality and ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin influence the color of skin, fleece and eyes
 <cit> . at present, a large number of genes have been found to affect hair and skin color in humans and other vertebrate species
 <cit> , although the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating coat color in fiber-producing species, such as the alpaca, are not completely understood.

alpacas have a great variety of natural coat colors. studies of the melanocortin- <dig> receptor  and agouti signaling protein  genes in alpacas of different coat colors revealed several polymorphisms that may be predictive of coat color
 <cit> . powell et al. reported that the m87v and s126g variants of mc1r may affect coat color with brown coat color animals showing homozygosity for the methionine and serine alleles
 <cit> . tyrosinase related protein  <dig>  is encoded by the brown locus and is involved in eumelanin synthesis
 <cit> . mutations in tyrp <dig> are associated with brown coat color in many species
 <cit> , but mutations in tyrp <dig> associated with brown coat color in alpacas have not been reported to date. previous studies in our laboratory revealed that the expression of many coat color genes including mc1r, tyrp <dig>  tyrosinase , tyrosinase related protein  <dig> , nitric oxide synthase  <dig> , paired box protein  <dig> , and wnt3a was higher in skin of brown versus white alpacas, suggestive of a functional contribution to coat color regulation in this species. however, the potential contribution of mirnas to differential expression  of such genes has not been fully elucidated, primarily due to a lack of knowledge of the mirna transcriptome profile in alpaca skin.

previous studies have addressed expression and function of mirnas in mouse, goat and sheep skin
 <cit> . for example, mir- <dig>  a skin specific mirna, was up-regulated in psoriatic plaques and shown to be involved in inflammatory responses and keratinocyte functions
 <cit> . however, studies of the functional role of mirnas in coat color regulation are limited. dong et al. over-expressed mir- <dig> in mice and obtained a series of coat color changes in transgenic animals
 <cit> . zhu et al. reported differential expression of mir- <dig> in skin of white versus brown alpacas and a functional role of this mirna in the regulation of expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor , a transcription factor regulating expression of key genes involved in melanogenesis
 <cit> .

to better understand the potential role of mirnas in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes linked to pigmentation, we have characterized the mirna transcriptome in skin of alpaca of different coat colors by deep sequencing analysis. we report here the identification of hundreds of conserved mirnas and candidate novel mirnas in wa and ba skin. we also provide evidence of differential expression of mirnas in wa and ba, foundational to future studies of the potential functional role for such mirnas in post-transcriptional gene regulation linked to coat color.

RESULTS
overall complexity of srna pools between the wa and ba skin libraries
to identify mirnas expressed in alpaca skin, wa and ba skin small rna libraries were analyzed by deep sequencing. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained from wa and ba libraries respectively. after filtering out the low quality reads based on base quality value and removing adaptor sequences,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads were retrieved, corresponding to  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  unique sequences, which were the associated counts of the identical sequence reads, respectively. the length distribution of srna reads is shown in figure
 <dig>  the majority of the srnas were 21– <dig> nt in length, which is characteristic of srnas from metazoans. the most frequent length of srna sequenced was 22nt, which is identical to the classical size of dicer cleavage products.

the alpaca genome has been completely sequenced, but at low coverage and is not well annotated. thus, the alpaca  and bos taurus genome databases  were combined and used as a reference genome dataset for annotation of alpaca srnas. the total srna reads were mapped to the combined genome using the soap program, yielding  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  genome matched reads in wa and ba libraries, respectively. in order to annotate the classes of all srnas, all clean reads were mapped using several databases, including genbank, rfam, animal mirnas , exon and intron  and repeat associated rna. the representations of different types of srnas in wa and ba libraries are shown in figure
 <dig>  by aligning the srnas to all known animal mirna precursors,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique sequences were identified as potentially conserved mirna in wa and ba skin, respectively.

identification of conserved mirnas in alpaca skin
to further identify conserved mirnas in alpacas, all srna sequences were mapped to known mirnas in the mirbase  <dig>  database. after alignment and additional sequence analysis,  <dig> and  <dig> individual candidate mirnas from wa and ba skin libraries were identified, respectively. approximately  <dig> mirna families were represented in each library. several mirna families were represented by over  <dig>  reads, such as let- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  which were the  <dig> most abundant mirna families represented in wa and ba libraries . the read diversity of mirna families indicated that different mirna families have different expression patterns. besides the diversity in mirna families, there was considerable variation in number of mirna family members represented across families. for example,  <dig> and  <dig> mir- <dig> family members were represented in wa and ba libraries, whereas many mirna families only had  <dig> to  <dig> members .

differential expression of conserved mirnas in white and brown alpaca skin
in high throughput sequencing analysis, the number of reads is reflective of the expression level of mirnas. many conserved mirnas exhibited dissimilar expression patterns in wa versus ba skin. there were  <dig> mirnas showing markedly greater abundance in wa skin, and  <dig> mirnas more highly expressed in ba skin . for example, mir- <dig>  mir-542-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-22-3p were more abundantly expressed in wa skin, while mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were more highly expressed in ba skin. in order to validate the deep sequencing results,  <dig> mirnas were selected to determine their expression levels in white and brown alpaca skin by real time pcr. the results of real time pcr analysis confirmed the deep sequencing results . for example, based on deep sequencing results, the expression level of mir- <dig> in wa was almost  <dig> times higher than observed in ba. based on real time pcr results, the expression level of mir- <dig> in wa skin was also  <dig> times higher than observed in ba skin.

sequence divergence within known mirnas
the heterogeneity across sequenced reads at the 5’ and 3’ ends from the same arms within individual known mirnas detected were also analyzed. the 5’ ends exhibited less heterogeneity than the 3’ ends. for instance, mir-29c, mir-362-5p, and mir- <dig> were highly represented and sequenced from the two libraries. the predominant reads for these mirnas obtained from deep sequencing data varied from the mature mirna sequences in mirbase at the 3’ end, and they should be regarded as the primary functional molecule . collectively from the two libraries, the 5’ and 3’ end of  <dig> alpaca mirnas were different in sequence from corresponding annotated mirnas for each species in mirbase . furthermore, several abundant mirnas with higher sequencing reads, like mir-30a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were derived from different arms of the hairpin precursor than corresponding annotated mirnas in mirbase . thus, results suggest that the precursors of these mirnas develop functional molecules from both arms in the alpaca.

target gene prediction for mirnas in alpaca
mirnas have functions in numerous developmental, physiological and pathological processes
 <cit> . in order to provide insight into potential biological roles of mirnas identified in alpaca skin, target prediction analysis was performed for alpaca skin mirnas identified. the rules employed for target prediction were based on those reported by allen et al.
 <cit>  and schwab et al.
 <cit> . there were  <dig> genes predicted as the putative targets of conserved mirnas in wa  and ba  skin, respectively. the predicted target genes were then subjected to gene ontology analysis for functional classification. although the target functions of mirna in wa and ba skin had some divergence, the top functions of targets were binding, transferase activity, molecular transducer activity, and receptor activity . the kegg pathway was also used to further classify putative mirna targets. all predicted targets were clustered into  <dig> pathways in wa and ba, respectively. results were then interrogated for potential target genes implicated in coat color regulation and the melanogenesis pathway. many genes in the melanogenesis pathway have already been shown to have a relationship with coat color in alpaca
 <cit> , such as pro-opiomelanocortin , melanocyte-stimulating hormone , mitf, kit oncogene  and tyr. moreover, several mirnas whose targets are involved in melanogenesis were expressed differentially in wa and ba skin. the target genes for the top  <dig> significantly expressed mirnas in wa and ba included in the melanogenesis pathway are shown in table
 <dig> 

identification of novel mirnas in alpaca skin
because the alpaca genome has not been annotated, the bovine genome was utilized to identify potential novel mirnas. it is well known that the important feature of mirnas distinguishing them from other small rnas is the ability of their genomic flanking sequences to fold into a hairpin structure
 <cit> . the mireap software was used to predict novel mirnas using these properties. after filtering,  <dig> and  <dig> sequencing reads from wa and ba skin remained. blast analysis against all mature mirnas in mirbase, revealed  <dig> mirnas from wa and  <dig> mirnas from ba libraries that had no homology with other species. in these novel mirnas,  <dig> mirnas were common between wa and ba libraries. thus, a total of  <dig> unique novel mirnas were identified . the hairpin structures for these novel mirnas were denoted in additional file
 <dig>  the lengths of these novel mirnas ranged from  <dig> to 24nt, and the minimum free energy  of the novel mirnas varied from − <dig>  to − <dig>  kcal mol- <dig>  the average mfe of novel mirnas was − <dig>  kcal mol- <dig>  which is lower than trna and rrna. this result was similar to results of bonnet et al.
 <cit>  indicating that the majority of mirnas exhibit a folding free energy which is lower than shuffled sequences. to further identify genuine mirnas, the length of the rnas was also considered. the mfe index  was used to re-evaluate the potential novel mirnas identified. zhang et al. suggested that the mfei for mirnas was  <dig> , significantly higher than trnas, rrnas or mrnas
 <cit> . the mfei of the  <dig> potential novel mirnas ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . using the mfei cutoff value of  <dig> ,  <dig> novel mirnas present in the two libraries were identified . expression of these new mirnas was typically several to a hundred counts lower than conserved mirnas.

discussion
studies on expression and function of mirnas in evolutionarily diverse agricultural species are limited. the alpaca is a domestic mammal specialized in fiber production
 <cit>  and has more than  <dig> natural coat colors
 <cit> . in this report, we explored the mirna transcriptome in alpaca skin using deep sequencing technology, and provided a foundation for future functional studies on the relationship between mirna expression and development and function of skin including coat color.

many mirnas have been identified by traditional sanger sequencing and microarray methods. however, the high throughout-sequencing method which yields  <dig>  reads per run and identifies low abundance tags is a much more comprehensive method for mirna profiling
 <cit> . using this sequencing approach, we found  <dig> novel, as well as  <dig> and  <dig> conserved mirnas in wa and ba skin libraries
 <cit> . according to the new mirna family classifications in rfam ,  <dig> mirnas from wa and  <dig> mirnas from ba were grouped into  <dig> families. most of these identified mirna families are also conserved in other mammalian species, such as mouse
 <cit> , human
 <cit> , goat and sheep
 <cit> . expression of these conserved alpaca mirna families differed between wa and ba skin, based on both abundance and representation within mirna families. for example, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families both had abundant reads in wa and ba skin libraries, but mir-146b  and mir- <dig>  were of greater abundance in wa than ba. this significant variation maybe attributed to the timing and location of mirna expression during skin development in adult alpacas. in many mirna families, there was a predominant member whose reads were significantly higher than other members. for example, the let- <dig> mirna family contains  <dig> members. the reads for let-7a were more than one million, but let-7i only had five thousand reads. it is possible that the predominant member in each mirna was responsible for the regulatory role at the developmental stage in which skin samples were collected in the present studies.

we compared the expression of conserved mirnas between wa and ba skin and identified differentially expressed mirnas from the two libraries. the expression of mirnas has an established relationship with cell proliferation and differentiation. as such, differences in mirna expression between animals possibly reflect alterations in growth and differentiation. heterochrony, or change in the timing of developmental growth, is known to alter the overall shape of developing tissues, leading to differences in physiology
 <cit> . alternatively, there are pronounced phenotypic differences between wa and ba which include fiber diameter, staple length, hair color and other hair characteristics
 <cit> . thus, differences in mirna abundance may also be related to hair color and other fiber characteristics. the functional role of such differentially expressed mirnas is the focus of future investigation.

in animals, mirnas target mrnas with partial sequence complementarity
 <cit> . one mirna is inferred to influence expression of hundreds of mrnas via this flexible recognition. there were many differentially expressed mirnas identified between wa and ba skin, so the next step was to search for putative specific genes targeted by these mirnas. the major physiological difference of interest between the samples analyzed was coat color, so we focused on potential target genes regulating pigmentation. based on kegg pathway analysis, we found  <dig> potential mirna target genes involved in melanogenesis. many mirnas targeting these genes have been reported. for examples, mir-137
 <cit>  and mir-25
 <cit>  were previously shown to regulate the expression of mitf, which is an important regulator of melanocyte growth, maturation, apoptosis and melanogenesis. in the present study, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were found in both libraries and their target genes also included mitf. haflidadóttir et al. showed that mir- <dig> affects mitf mrna expression in melanoma cells through a conserved binding site in the 3’-utr sequences of mouse and human mitf
 <cit> . in our studies, mir- <dig> showed greater expression in wa versus ba. so, it is possible that mir- <dig> may contribute to coat color differences between wa and ba.

the present studies also revealed that both mir-193a and mir-193b are differentially expressed in wa and ba skin. gao et al. reported that kit expression was subject to post-transcriptional regulation by mir-193a and mir-193b in human acute myeloid leukemia
 <cit> . in humans, kit contributes to the regulation of skin pigmentation
 <cit>  and we have previously reported kit expression is higher in skin of ba versus wa
 <cit> . thus, mir-193a and mir-193b may play a role in coat color determination in alpacas via regulating the expression of kit.

CONCLUSIONS
studies reported provide novel information on mirna expression in alpaca species, including conserved mirnas and potential novel mirnas, and insight into differential mirna expression associated with coat color and respective target genes. the predicted targets of the conserved mirnas include  <dig> genes related to melanogenesis. further validation of the functional role of differentially expressed mirnas and their targets will provide better understanding of the mirna regulatory mechanisms influencing coat color.
