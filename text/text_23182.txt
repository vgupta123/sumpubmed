BACKGROUND
cytidine deaminases of the apobec <dig>  gene family have a broad antiviral activity against retroviruses, can inhibit ltr- and non-ltr-retrotransposons, parvoviruses, hepadnaviruses, flaviviruses and paramyxoviruses, and might repress also tt-viruses, papillomaviruses and herpesviruses
 <cit> . under the already tested additional viruses, adenoviruses, poxviruses and influenza viruses replicate well irrespective of a3s
 <cit> . the hunt is on for the identification of additional viral targets
 <cit> . the apobec <dig> gene family encodes a characteristic zinc -coordinating catalytic motif 
 <cit>  and the a <dig> proteins can be classified according to the presence of an a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> or a3z <dig> motif
 <cit> . a3s act by deaminating cytidine into uridine  using single-stranded dna as a substrate. this dna editing results in the introduction of mutations that eventually render the target genome inactive. however, uncontrolled chemical editing of dna sequences puts at risk the genomic information in the cell
 <cit>  and many mechanistic questions regarding a <dig> activity and substrate specificity remain open.

during retroviral budding, a <dig> molecules incorporated into progeny retroviral particles are carried over within the virion and counteract the new infection upon release in the cytoplasm of the newly infected cell. retroviruses have evolved mechanisms to prevent encapsidation of a3s into viral particles. the vif protein in lentiviruses, the bet protein in foamyviruses and the nucleocapsid protein in human t-cell lymphotrophic virus accomplish this anti-antiviral activity
 <cit> . the expression of a3s is not restricted to the immune system
 <cit> , and different cell types may express different a <dig> repertoires, and even different variants may present different subcellular location
 <cit> . thus, some retroviruses without vif or bet genes might escape a3-mediated antiviral inhibition by a restriction of their cellular tropisms, as it is discussed for the equine infectious anemia virus <cit> . several aspects on how retroviruses cope with the deaminase activity of the a3s encoded by their host species are still a matter of debate
 <cit> . thus, and despite several studies, it remains unknown which strategies the moloney murine leukemia virus or the mouse mammary tumor virus have evolved to prevent inhibition by the murine a3
 <cit> .

in mammals the a <dig> locus appears always flanked by the cbx <dig> and cbx <dig> genes but there is ample variation across species, regarding the number and arrangement of a <dig> individual genes, presence of fused genes, expression pattern, splice alternatives and read-through mechanisms and substrate specificity, even in related species. thus, although primates and rodents are relatives and belong together within euarchontoglires, the human genome contains seven a <dig> genes, four of them resulting from the fusion of two a <dig> domains, while the mouse genome encodes for a single a3z2-a3z <dig> fused gene
 <cit> . additionally the dog genome presents two a <dig> genes, while there are four a <dig> genes in cats, two to three in pigs, sheep and cow and six in horses
 <cit> , and all these species belong together within laurasiatheria. the finding of a3z <dig>  a3z <dig>  and a3z <dig> genes in these two mammalian lineages strongly indicates that their ancestor  was probably equipped with a single copy of each gene.

one important mechanism of genome evolution and for the appearance of novel gene functions is gene duplication
 <cit> . genes within a genome that are descendants of gene duplications are paralogs, while two genes in different species that derive from a single gene in the last common ancestor of both species are orthologs. paralogs derive either from an ancestral duplication  or they derive from a lineage-specific duplication , giving rise to co-orthologous relationships
 <cit> . several models for the emergence, maintenance and evolution of gene copies have been proposed . the duplication of genes may in some cases have no immediate consequence for the host, but in other cases can be deleterious or linked to disease
 <cit> , or confer an selective advantage
 <cit> . for the antiviral a <dig> genes evolutionary solutions reflect the trade off between a potential self-toxicity against cellular dna -in cases of an a <dig> exacerbated response- and the emergence of viral pathogens if low a <dig> activity and/or diversity allow for restriction escape variants. fixation of duplicated a <dig> genes and the subsequent preservation in certain population is likely driven by a strong selective advantage for the individuals carrying additional copies of the gene/s. any subsequent acquisition of genetic differences between the gene copies can alter the chances of both copies being preserved and might change the function of the encoded proteins and result either in gene loss, ‘neo-functionalization’
 <cit>  or ‘sub-functionalization’
 <cit> .

we present here a time scale of the evolution of the a <dig> loci, arising from their common origin with other cytidine deaminases. according to our results, the track of duplications in the a <dig> locus started with the ancestral gene itself. the appearance of the three clades within the a <dig> family dates back to emergence of placental mammals. the evolutionary history of a3s has since then been landmarked by duplication events especially in primates, but also in perissodactyla and carnivora, as well as by deletions events, such as in rodentia. three main trends can be observed: first, a sustained decrease in evolutionary rate for the a <dig> subfamilies in the last  <dig> mya; second, duplication events have occurred in the a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> subfamilies, but not in the a3z3; third, duplication events accumulate in the last  <dig> mya. the molecular mechanisms that generate the tandem duplication of a <dig>  and the evolutionary pressures that drive the sub/neofunctionalisation and eventually selection of the duplicated genes still need to be identified.

RESULTS
there are three main clades of a <dig> genes
we have found sequences corresponding to a <dig> genes in extant members of laurasiatheria , euarchontoglires  and afrotheria . however, blast and psi-blast searches of genomic, est and other sequence databases failed to find a <dig> in any other taxon within other placental mammals  marsupials, monotremes, or in non-mammals. a selection of  <dig> aicda sequences  was identified as sister taxa to all a3s, while a selection of  <dig> a <dig> sequences  was identified as outgroup. an exhaustive list of species and accession numbers is given in additional file
1: table s <dig>  using this dataset, we performed first phylogenetic reconstruction using both maximum likelihood and bayesian inference, identified local topologies suitable for molecular dating, and then performed time inference introducing this information as temporal constrains using a relaxed clock approach. the global results are shown in figure 
 <dig>  more detailed results are shown in additional file
2: figure s <dig> which shows the bootstrap values of the ml analysis and additional file
3: figure s <dig> which contains the 95% highest posterior density  of the node ages.

the most recent common ancestor  of the a1s, a3s and aicda sequences can be dated  <dig> mya . the mrca of the a3s and aicda sequences can be dated  <dig> mya , while the mrca of extant a <dig> sequences can be dated  <dig> mya  . the three members of the a <dig> family radiated later at comparable time points:  <dig> mya  for a3z1;  <dig> mya  for a3z2; and  <dig> mya  for a3z <dig>  the relationships among the three a <dig> subfamilies could not be solved with certainty, but both ml  and bayesian inference  suggested a sisterhood relationship between a3z <dig> and a3z <dig>  with a mrca dated  <dig> mya . only more quality data from afrotheria, or the discovery of a <dig> genes in monotremes, marsupials and/or xenarthra may help us define and date these basal nodes with confidence.

evolution of the a <dig> loci in euarchontoglires
rodents and primates are the two main orders in euarchontoglires. we could identify different a <dig> genes in the genomes of platyrrhines  and catarrhines . in modern humans eleven a <dig> open reading frames exist, forming seven genes encoding a single z domain or a z-z domain, either fused a3z2-a3z <dig> or a3z2-a3z <dig> . this is by far the most complex known organisation of the a <dig> loci. we must however keep in mind that our knowledge on the structure of the a <dig> loci in other primate genomes, especially regarding transcriptomic data, is still fragmentary.

a3z <dig> genes in primates
the a3z <dig> gene appears in humans in three copies, named z1a, z1b and z1c, and we will name the corresponding orthologs according to the nomenclature in humans . the mrca of a3z <dig> genes can be dated  <dig> mya , which grossly corresponds to the basal divergence time of primates, some 73– <dig> mya. orthologs of the a3z <dig> genes can be found in the genomes of several haplorrhini species, including catarrhini  and platyrrhini . we could only detect one a3z <dig> gene in the platyrrhines genomes we have browsed, and these sequences are the outgroup of the z1a, z1b and z1c found in catarrhines. phylogenetic relationships and inferred divergence times among the z1c orthologs grossly correspond to those among the corresponding species. regarding the z1a and z1b genes, we could identify the orthologs of both human genes in the genomes of the common chimpanzee, western gorilla, northern white-cheeked gibbon and rhesus macaque. the ortholog of the z1b human gene could be identified in the sumatran orangutang. the duplication event that generated the z1a and z1b genes can be dated some  <dig> mya . this timing could be compatible with the hylobatidae/hominidae split some 18– <dig> mya, although it matches well the cercopithecidae/hominoidea split some 26– <dig> mya
 <cit> .

a plausible scenario for the evolution of the a3z <dig> loci in primates would include a basal split, generating the ancestors of the z1a/z1b  and the z1c genes. whether this first duplication event predates the early split haplorrhini /strepsirrhini  or is rather exclusive to the haplorrhini lineage is not clear and must still be solved, since there are no sequence data available for strepsirrhini. in catarrhini, the ancestral z1c gene may have evolved without further duplication event. the ancestral z1ab gene underwent duplication and generated the ancestral z1a and z1b genes. orthologs of both z1a and z1b are present in all hominids
 <cit> , as the mrca to both genes predates well the split ponginae/homininae. future identification of z1ab genes in hylobatids and in cercopithecoids will clear whether the z1a/z1b duplication event is basal to catarrhini or to hominoidea.

a3z <dig> genes in primates
our fragmentary information on the a <dig> gene content makes it impossible to reconstruct with confidence the evolutionary relationships among the a3z <dig> genes in primates. additionally, a number of a3z <dig> sequences arise from genomic material while others belong to cdna, and the complex alternative splicing of the a <dig> genes may disturb further the algorithms for phylogenetic inference. finally, in this locus gene conversion may have played a key role, given the large number of gene duplication events in this a <dig> subfamilly -up to six in humans- and the nature of the locus, where the copies generated remain in a tandem arrangement. a proper phylogenetic reconstruction will thence need to wait until genomic sequences with better coverage are available for a larger number of primate species, especially if encompassing strepsirrhini and tarsiidae. a basal split event some  <dig> mya  generated the two main lineages z2bdf and z2aceg. this timing could match the basal strepsirrhini/haplorrhini diversification time in primates , although it would be more compatible with one duplication exclusive to haplorrhini  or even to simiiformes. in either case our interpretation implies that the ancestral simiiformes already carried two copies of the a3z <dig> genes in their genomes. the z2bdf group comprises exclusively sequences from catarrhines, with an estimated mrca around  <dig> mya . sequences here cluster into two groups: z2b and z2df. both clusters contain sequences from cercopithecoids and from hominoids. it can thus be inferred that the duplication event that generated both groups took place before the divergence between cercopithecoids and hominoids some  <dig> mya. this timing is compatible with the estimated mrcas around  <dig> mya  for z2b and  <dig> mya  for z2df. within the z2aceg group, phylogenetic inference cannot solve the fine relationships. only a major, monophyletic group containing the z2g genes can be clearly defined, containing sequences of both catarrhines and platyrrhines. phylogenetic relationships among z2g genes grossly correspond to those of the corresponding species: platyrrhines are basal to the cluster, with calculated split time  <dig> mya , and cercopithecoids and hominids cluster separately, with a mrca around  <dig> mya .

a plausible scenario for the evolution of the a3z <dig> genes in primates would include a first basal split z2aceg/z2bdf, previous to the split between platyrrhini and catarrhini. the ancestral z2aceg underwent a second duplication z2ace/z2g also before this split event. modern z2a, z2c and z2e human genes appeared after subsequent duplication events. on the other hand, the ancestral z2bdf underwent a first duplication z2b/z2df at least before the divergence between cercopithecoids and hominoids. the basal position of human z2d with respect to z2f sequences suggests also that the duplication event z2d/z2f predates diversification within catarrhines, but a larger repertoire of sequences is needed here to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships with confidence.

a3z <dig> genes in primates
orthologs of the a3z <dig> gene can be found in the genomes of the catarrhines chimpanzee, bonobo, human, gorilla, bornean and sumatran orangutan, gibbon and macaque . the mrca of these a3z <dig> genes dates back to  <dig> mya . in all these species the a3z <dig> gene appears as a single copy, with no evidences of gene duplication. additionally, the phylogenetic relationships among these genes and the inferred timing for the nodes perfectly match those of the corresponding species. the most parsimonious explanation for the absence of a3z <dig> in platyrrhines and in other primates is therefore our lack of information about the locus, and it can be anticipated that the missing a3z <dig> genes should be identified in the future, as genome coverage increases.

a <dig> genes in rodents
in the rodent cavia porcellus, as in rat and mouse, the z2z <dig> genes are fused and the a3z <dig> gene is missing. considering the presence of a3z <dig> in primates, the last common ancestor of muridae and caviidae probably possessed already 50– <dig> mya the genome organization found in the extant rat and mouse genomes. precise answers on the timing for the a3z <dig> deletion event and for the z2z <dig> fusion event will need to wait until new genomic information is available. interesting sequences could come from the genomes of squirrels, which are basal to muridae/caviidae, or from rabbits, which constitute together with rodents the glires taxon, sister to primates.

evolution of the a <dig> loci in laurasiatheria
a <dig> genes in cetartiodactyla
in the group of cetartiodactyla  the evolution of the individual a <dig> genes matches the evolution of the host genomes , although there is controversy about the phylogenetic relationships among mammalian orders here
 <cit> . the genomes of cow and sheep present single copies of the a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> genes, with no evidences for gene duplications. in the a <dig> locus in the pig, the a3z <dig> gene however seems to have been lost during evolution
 <cit> . the presence of a a3z <dig> gene in the genomes of cow and sheep suggests that the loss of the a3z <dig> gene in pig genome occurred after the split that generated the suidae lineage.

a <dig> genes in horses
modern horses have six a <dig> genes 
 <cit> , which arose from the ancestral a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> genes after relatively recent duplication events . the a3z <dig> locus in the horse genome experienced a duplication event ca.  <dig> mya , whereas the a3z <dig> locus underwent three rounds of expansion between  <dig> and  <dig> mya. the phylogenetic relationships as well as the accord in timing for the last two duplications suggest that the tandem of ancestral z2ac and z2bd genes underwent duplication in a single step, generating the present day arrangement z2a z2b z2c z2d z2e
 <cit> . the equus genus dates back to ca.  <dig> mya, posterior to the duplication events that shaped the a <dig> loci in horses. thus, it is highly likely that other equidae, such as zebra and donkey also present a horse-like a <dig> gene locus.

a <dig> genes in carnivora
evidences of a <dig> genes can be found in the genome of canids and felids. the a3z <dig> gene is present in all carnivores genomes analysed, but the a3z <dig> gene is missing in felidae and the a3z <dig> gene is missing in canidae . both gene loss events must have occurred independently after the split between cat and dog lineages, some 43– <dig> mya. in the genome of the domestic cat  we identified four a <dig> genes , while only one expressed a3z <dig> and one a3z <dig> gene could be found in diverse species in the panthera genus
 <cit> . the duplication events that generated the three a3z <dig> genes in the genome of the cat date  <dig> mya  and  <dig> mya  . although fine details in the evolution of felids are a matter of debate, the mrca of pantherinae and felinae could have lived some  <dig> mya
 <cit> . the fact that we have found the a3z <dig> gene in lion, tiger and leopard –all of them pantherinae- basal to the a3z <dig> genes in cat, puma and lynx –all of them felinae- suggests that the split between pantherinae and felinae predated the duplication events that generated the a3z <dig> diversity in cats. further, three different mrna sequences were retrieved from lion and two from tiger
 <cit> . if these mrna sequences originated from different genes this would imply that independent gene duplications could have occurred in the panthera lineage. however, considering again the potential for multiple alternative splicing in the a <dig> genes, the analysis of genomic sequences is required to determine whether panthers and cats have found similar, convergent evolutionary answers to a selective pressure that we still need to identify.

evidences for selection in the evolution of a <dig> loci
the a <dig> genes of primates, rodents, felids, horses and pigs have been described to be under a positive selection
 <cit> . we have searched for hints of positive selection in the sequences in our dataset using bayesian inference. the aicda gene, the sister taxon of the a3s, showed to be under strict purifying selection while all a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> genes contained residues under positive selection . considering all sequences, the distribution of ka/ks values was clearly multimodal  for all three a <dig> genes, with around 25% of positions under strict purifying selection, with ka/ks values below  <dig> , and above 10% of positions under positive selection, with ka/ks values above  <dig> . to exclude that these results were driven by the sequences gathered from primates the calculations were repeated after excluding them from the dataset, with a similar outcome . a slide-window analysis showed that the ka/ks profiles were similar along the sequences of the three genes , reflecting that the repertoire of sites that are allowed to mutate and to explore sequence space are not evenly distributed and that to a certain extent localise to similar positions in the three a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> genes. positions around codons  <dig> and  <dig> exhibit very low ka/ks values in all three a <dig> genes. there is a better coincidence of the ka/ks profiles in the c-terminus of the sequences analysed, while there is ample variation in the first  <dig> codons of the alignment, with a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> presenting islands of increased the ka/ks values that do not always overlap. the global distribution of ka/ks values in all sequences is depicted in figure 
 <dig>  where the complexity of the distribution is evident, showing the existence of different site levels of purifying selection, a large proportion of sites evolving close to neutrality and a 10-20% of the area below the curve corresponding to sites under diversifying selection .

evolutionary rate has decreased in the three a <dig> subfamilies
the introduction of the variable time in the phylogenetic analyses allows to identify variations of the evolutionary rates in different taxa. the global mutation rate for our sequences set was  <dig> ·10- <dig> substitutions per site per my . the evolutionary rates were not homogeneous for the five gene families analysed . regarding the a <dig> genes the evolutionary rate is around  <dig>  10- <dig> substitutions per site per my, . for this gene family there has been a significant decrease in evolutionary rate with time , but it is mainly lead by the values sampled for the oldest node at the root of the family. when this node is not included in the analyses, the evolutionary rate has not significantly varied with time in the last  <dig> my . the aicda genes, the sister group to a3s, displayed the lowest evolutionary rate among the sequences studied  and this value has not experienced changes with time in the last  <dig> my . all a3s however displayed increased evolutionary rate values, around  <dig>  times higher than the aicda sistergroup . very interestingly, the evolutionary rate for each of the three a <dig> subfamilies has significantly decreased in the last  <dig> my. for a3z <dig> and a3z <dig>  the linear dependence with time explains a large variation in the evolutionary rate, above 50% for both genes . in the case of the a3z <dig> this dependence is still significant but less obvious, and explains less than 15% of the total variability in evolutionary rate.

evolution of the evolutionary rate measured as variation of the substitution per site per  <dig>  na not analysed. ns correlation was not significant. values connected by the same letter are not significantly different after a tukey-kramer honestly significant difference test.

discussion
a <dig> genes belong to a large superfamily of deaminases that edit nucleic acids and constitute the sister taxa to aicda, as previous studies suggested
 <cit> . certain members of the deaminase family, such as a <dig>  target rna as a substrate, but it has been proposed that the ancestral activity may have been to target dna
 <cit> . our results show that the mrca of aicda and a <dig>  ca  <dig> mya, predates the split between the lineages of zebra fish and humans. the subsequent duplication events of the ancestral a <dig> gene to generate the three extant a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> genes could not be dated with precision and overlap largely. the first one occurred ca.  <dig> mya  and the second one ca.  <dig> mya . representatives of laurasiatheria, euarchontoglires and afrotheria are found in all a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> subtrees. for afrotherians, a few sequences were found basal to the a3z <dig> subgroup , to the a3z <dig> subgroup  or to the a3z <dig> subgroup . on the view of the evolutionary relationships and time divergences, we can conclude that the duplication events that originated the three ancestral a <dig> loci had already occurred well before diversification within placental mammals, which took place at some point between 95– <dig> mya
 <cit> . the presence of a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> representatives in afrotheria and of a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> in boreoeutheria sustains also this view. the estimated appearance of the most recent common ancestor of all a3s predates the split between placental mammals and marsupials 125– <dig> mya, and also the split of monotremes at the base of the crown clade of modern mammals, debated between 160– <dig> mya
 <cit> , and 203– <dig> mya
 <cit> . thus, our data support an evolutionary scenario where the genome of the mrca of all mammals already encoded for at least an ancestral a <dig>  and where the genome of the mrca of all placental mammals already encoded for a a3z1-a3z2-a3z <dig> arrangement. this genomic arrangement is conserved in all placental mammals, with the a <dig> genes flanked by the cbx <dig> and cbx <dig> genes, as in chromosome  <dig> q <dig>  in humans. this conserved chromosomic location could be used for targeting and sequencing of the a <dig> locus of selected species in the future. unfortunately, the sequence gap between cbx <dig> and cbx <dig> is not resolved with certainty in the opossum and in the platypus genomes, and we cannot confirm whether the last common ancestor of eutheria and metatheria already possessed a single ancestral a <dig>  the intermediate stage with two loci, or already three loci, as the ancestor of all placental mammals. a note of caution should be nevertheless stated here, since our results cannot go beyond the sequence dataset that we have been able to gather. in a number of genomes we have not been able to recover any relative of the a <dig> sequences. this holds true for monotremes, marsupials and xenarthra. for other organisms we have not been able to detect certain a <dig> genes, such as the a3z <dig> gene in the cat genome and in rodentia, or the a3z <dig> gene in the dog genome. since for humans the existence of copy number variation in the a3a and a3b genes is documented in a good number of cases , a similar situation can be detected in the future in other species. it is important to note here that obtaining genomic sequences of the a <dig> locus is not trivial, as it evolves under strong selective pressures
 <cit> . in our current analyses we have opted for the most parsimonious explanation: e.g. the presence of an a3z <dig> gene in euarchontoglires and in felidae and the absence in canidae has been interpreted as the boroeutherian ancestor carrying a copy of the ancestral a3z <dig> gene, which may had got lost in the canidae lineage. the hypothetical finding in the future of an a3z <dig> gene in canidae would not affect our timing results as all calibrations have been chosen on subtrees whose structure matched that of the corresponding species .

the results here presented show that the a <dig> loci in mammalian genomes are extremely variable and have undergone independent events of gene duplication followed by fixation, gene loss and gene fusion. the outcome of these events has lead to parallel evolution, as is the case of the loss of a3z <dig> gene in rodents, dogs and pigs. the most striking result, however, is that the amplification of a <dig> genes and the fixation of duplicated genes has been selected and expanded in the population, independently in several taxa, such as the a3z <dig> gene in primates , horses  and cats  and the a3z <dig> gene in primates and horses. further, an increase in the frequency of duplication events in the last  <dig> mya can be observed in these three lineages, i.e. human, horse, cat . gene duplications have occurred in both a3z <dig> and a3z <dig>  but not in the a3z <dig> clade. duplication of the a3z <dig> gene seems thus to be unfavoured, possibly reflecting the trade-off between the advantages of an increased antiviral repertoire and the increased self-toxicity by gene dosage effect
 <cit> . also pointing in this direction, there is evidence for independent events of a3z <dig> activity loss in human alleles
 <cit> . finally, further data that exemplify the broad variability in the a <dig> locus come from copy number variation studies in humans, with several reports on the loss of the a3a  and/or the a3b  genes .

different taxa have selected similar solutions through independent events in the a <dig> locus in terms of gene duplications and/or deletions. such parallel evolution may be the response to similar environmental changes, e.g. increased retroviral activity either exogenous or endogenous, which could account for the parallel expansion of the a <dig> family in different mammalian clades. the fixation of similar duplication events in different lineages suggests that the preservation of the duplicated genes has a positive effect in fitness. further, the main activity of all a <dig> genes seems to be ssdna editing, and the differences among them are rather related to substrate specificity
 <cit> , expression pattern
 <cit> , and virus specificity
 <cit> . the fate of new a <dig> copies may thus be sub-functionalisation by broadening the spectrum of molecular targets that can be edited by the a <dig> proteins, and that this fine tuning of the edited dna substrates results in an increase in fitness. such shift in substrate specificity is also supported by the evidence of positive selection in a3s in primates, rodents, felids, horses
 <cit> , and our results confirm as well the presence of residues under positive selection in all a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> clades . however, the antiviral relevance of the differential deaminase activity as a function of the ssdna sequence still needs to be explored.

our results show that residues evolving under neutrality co-occur with residues under positive and under purifying selection in the a <dig> and in the a <dig> genes, and that this holds true for all sequences considered together even after accounting for the excess of primates sequences . for all these genes, there is a clear peak and a substantial proportion of sites evolving close to neutrality. additionally, a substantial amount of area below the curve is located in the two tails of the multimodal distribution, corresponding to positions evolving under strict purifying selection and intermediate values of  <dig>  < ka/ks <  <dig> , and under positive selection. previous descriptions had rather focused on specific genes in specific taxa, i.e. primates, rodents, horses, felids and pigs
 <cit> . our analyses have addressed the three a <dig> gene clusters in all mammals and show that multiple evolutionary pressures coexist in the same gene sequence. similar cases of positive selection observed as an increase of ka/ks during subfunctionalisation of duplicated genes has been also documented in other gene families
 <cit> . the biological interpretation of the significance of individual residues under positive selection needs to be analysed in the context of the evolution of the gene in which they reside and in the biochemical context of the exon combination present in the actually expressed proteins. methods for detecting positive selection based on ka/ks ratios may result in false positives, as a relaxation of evolutionary constraints could also lead to an increase in this parameter
 <cit> . such constraint relaxation is specially expected to occur in genes that have undergone duplication events, as it is the case in the a <dig> genes. thus, the actual meaning of sites under positive selection in the three a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> clades requires experimental confirmation. additionally, gene duplication could be the result of the genomic arms race between target viruses and their hosts, as novel a <dig> proteins can counteract anti-antiviral activity raised in a virus that evolves anti-a <dig> mechanisms, such as the vif or the bet protein
 <cit> . this combination could correspond to certain models among those proposed by innan and kondrashov
 <cit>  to classify the evolution of duplicated genes, such as modified duplication or diversifying selection. the evolution of the a3z <dig> locus in primates, horse and cat, with several rounds of successive amplification events, suggests however that gene duplication may have occurred here through an adaptive radiation model, as proposed by francino
 <cit> . the new a <dig> copies could explore the sequence space that expands the family of substrates for the action of deaminases, typically by modifying the sequence context of the c- > u edition. similarity among duplicated genes could also allow for gene conversion and/or recombination
 <cit> , further enlarging the repertoire of substrates. in analogy to gene conversion at the dna level, similarity in dna sequence between tandem duplicated genes may be responsible for the read-through mrna species that encompass exons from different genes, and that have been described in cats
 <cit> , horses
 <cit>  and pigs
 <cit>  and have also been communicated in humans
 <cit>  . currently more than  <dig> ests in the databases map onto the a <dig> human loci, with a number of them containing spliced exons from different a <dig> genes . this additional generation of diversity adds to the high number of alternatively spliced mrnas originated from each individual a <dig> gene, especially of those composed of two fused “mono” a3s, either a3z2-a3z <dig> or a3z2-a3z <dig>  in these cases we face fused genes that retain their individual coding capacity, can generate multiple splice alternatives and show potential to encode for read-through mrnas. finally, an additional level of spatiotemporal complexity to the regulation of this antiviral activity arises from a <dig> expression heterogeneity linked to cell type, tissue, developmental time or exposure to foreign dna.

the architecture of several tandem copies of paralogs in a genome facilitates non-homologous recombination among paralog copies resulting in gene conversion, as has been suggested for the a3g gene in humans
 <cit> . a high degree of gene conversion is expected to result in an increased degree of sequence similarity through concerted evolution
 <cit> , with the undesired outcome of rendering younger divergence times
 <cit> . our dataset is unfortunately not suited for an in-depth analysis of gene conversion, since it includes well-characterised mrnas, but also ests that may contain exons that originate from different genes and putative mrnas inferred from genomic sequences. a proper analysis will need good quality genomic sequences with enough sampling of individuals if variations found in the human a <dig> locus in terms of gene copy number and indels  appear also in other species. such analyses will need to address gene order within the locus, but also exon-intron order within the genes, and alternative splicing and mrna read-through. nevertheless, certain cases can be considered. the confounding role of gene conversion may have disturbed the phylogenetic reconstructions for the a3z <dig> genes. in primates, the a3z2a, a3z2c and a3z2e a3z2g paralogs have appeared after two duplication events from their common ancestor around  <dig> mya . the topology for the a3z2g subtree matches well the phylogeny of the corresponding species , and gene conversion may have had a limited impact here. the evolution of the a3z2a, a3z2c and a3z2e genes however cannot be reconstructed with confidence, and appears as a series of small branches with small support values, which could be interpreted as a signature of gene conversion. the same holds true for the rest of the a3z <dig> paralogs, a3z2b/d/f. finally, a second candidate for gene conversion to have occurred is the a3z2a/b gene tandem in the cat genome
 <cit> .

the aicda genes show the lowest evolutionary rate among the five clades studied,  <dig>  10- <dig> substitutions per site per my, significantly different from the values inferred for the three a <dig> genes, which are around three times higher . very interestingly, we have found that these evolutionary rates have decreased for the a <dig> genes in the last  <dig> my, whereas for the aicda and the a <dig> genes there are no significant variations in the evolutionary rate with time . we interpret the different outcome for the a <dig> genes and for their sister taxa as an evidence for our results being genuine rather than an artefact from the evolutionary inference. the simultaneous identification of positions evolving under positive selection in the three a <dig> genes and the finding of a trend towards decrease with time of the evolutionary rate in the same genes are not contradictory. our calculations for ka/ks have been performed separately for each position, while the values inferred for the evolutionary rates refer to the corresponding nodes in the phylogenetic reconstruction. in our scenario of gene duplication and gene family expansion, we interpret that the episodes of gene duplication have lowered the restrictions on the duplicated copies of the genes, thus allowing for increased evolutionary rates. subfunctionalisation of the sister copies may have yielded one population of conserved sites evolving under purifying pressures , one population of sites positively selected sites  and a third large majority of sites evolving close to neutrality. the decrease in evolutionary rate possibly reflects a plateau in the fixation of the novel function. in the a3z <dig> genes, which have undergone the largest number of duplication events, the large variation in evolutionary rate for the different nodes  and the lower proportion of the decrease in evolutionary rate that is explained by the independent variable time alone  supports further the idea that gene duplication fosters a transient increase in evolutionary rate.

we have not been able to identify in the databases sequences that could be orthologs of the a <dig> genes in marsupials or in monotremes. we have dated the mrca of the a <dig> genes around  <dig> mya , and the second split that generated the mrca of a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> around  <dig> mya . the timing for the crown clade of mammals  as well as the timing for the split between marsupials and placentals are controversial, ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> mya
 <cit> . three explanations could thence account for the absence of extant a <dig> genes in monotremes and marsupials: i) we simply lack information and further sequencing will provide us with the missing genes; ii) members of one or of both groups may indeed have lost the a <dig> genes; and iii) genes may be exclusive to placentals if the mrca of placental mammals predates the appearance of the mrca of all a3s. our interpretation implies in any case that the genome of the placental ancestor already encoded for an a <dig> locus with the arrangement a3z1-a3z2-a3z <dig>  the absence of a <dig> genes in xenarthra, the fourth large clade within placental mammals, must therefore imply either gene loss or incomplete coverage of the a <dig> locus in the two species analysed. since we have described that loss of certain a <dig> genes has occurred in parallel in different lineages, as in rodents and in artyodactyla, it is conceivable that in certain lineages the loss of all a <dig> genes may have been selected. the adaptive value of an enlarged armoury against viruses is obvious, and evidences supporting positive selection of the a <dig> genes in different branches of the mammalian tree are strong. the intriguing hypothesis of the total local loss of a <dig> genes might imply that the constraints and pressures imposed by viral infections can largely vary among different taxa. certain host lineages may thus either be less exposed to  viruses, and/or may have evolved alternative antiviral strategies. an exciting question that arises from our dating results is the relative coincidence in time between speciation events and gene duplication events, as exemplified in figures 
 <dig> and
 <dig>  it could be speculated that gene duplication of the a <dig> genes may trigger speciation, possibly through the differential fitness against viral infections that the additional a <dig> gene copy provides. further genetic and functional research will be required to elucidate the fitness landscapes integrating viral pressures, expansion of the a <dig> repertoire and concomitant risks for the own genetic information.

CONCLUSIONS
the a <dig> gene family appeared together with the ancestral mammals. independently in certain lineages, the a <dig> locus was expanded through a series of tandem duplications, best exemplified in primates. the repertoire of a <dig> proteins is additionally expanded through splice alternatives and read-through mechanisms, resulting in broader substrate specificity and finer regulation of dna modification potential. we have shown that this diversity has been generated by series of tandem duplication in the a <dig> locus probably followed by positive selection and/or relaxation of constraints and resulting in sub/neo-functionalisation. such evolutionary solution has been independently selected in several lineages: primates, felids and equids. our findings constitute a paradigm of genomic parallel evolutionary solutions in the framework of the arms race between viruses and their hosts.
