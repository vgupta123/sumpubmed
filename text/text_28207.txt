BACKGROUND
checkpoint mechanisms are important for cell survival and genetic stability. they prevent cell cycle transitions until previous events have been completed or damaged dna has been repaired  <cit> . checkpoint pathways and proteins are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man, underlining their importance in maintaining genomic integrity. in fission yeast several checkpoint pathways monitor the status of the dna and arrest the cell cycle in response to dna damage or inhibition of dna replication  <cit>  they include mechanisms to inhibit mitosis when the dna is damaged  or when s phase has not been completed  as well as a mechanism to inhibit ongoing dna replication when the dna is damaged . screens designed to reveal elements of the checkpoint pathways have led to the identification of the so-called checkpoint rad genes as well as crb2/rhp <dig>  mrc <dig>  chk <dig> and cds <dig>  <cit>  the checkpoint rad genes consist of rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig> and hus <dig> . rad <dig> is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family of proteins and the closest mammalian homologue is the atr  protein  <cit> . rad <dig> forms a complex with rad <dig> and this association is required for activation of rad <dig> kinase activity in response to dna damage or replication arrest  <cit>  the rad <dig>  rad <dig> and hus <dig> proteins have similarities to pcna, the sliding clamp of the replicative dna polymerase, and the three proteins may form a similar ring-shaped structure  <cit> . rad <dig> has similarities to all five subunits of replication factor c  <cit> , a complex which loads pcna onto chromatin.

there are two known effector kinases downstream of the checkpoint rad proteins, chk <dig> and cds <dig>  chk <dig> is phosphorylated in response to dna damage induced in late s or g <dig> in a rad <dig> dependent manner  <cit> . phosphorylation of chk <dig> leads to an increase of chk <dig> kinase activity  <cit>  and is often used as a convenient molecular marker for chk <dig> dependent checkpoint activation. cds <dig> is activated only in s phase as part of the intra-s and the s/m checkpoints  <cit>  activation of either kinase leads to inhibition of cdc <dig> activity by maintaining the inhibitory phosphorylation on tyr <dig>  <cit> .

crb <dig> and mrc <dig> act upstream of chk <dig> and cds <dig>  respectively. crb <dig> shares homology with the budding yeast rad <dig> protein  <cit> , which is involved in delaying entry into s phase upon dna damage in g <dig>  <cit>  in fission yeast, crb <dig> is required both for activation of chk <dig> and for subsequent inactivation of chk <dig> for reentry into the cell cycle  <cit>  mrc <dig> plays a parallel role by binding to and activating cds <dig>  expression of mrc <dig> is regulated in the cell cycle, thus linking cds <dig> activation to s phase  <cit> .

in addition to the g2/m, s/m and intra-s checkpoints, three papers have reported the existence of g <dig> checkpoints that inhibit mitosis when the cells are arrested in g <dig> using cell cycle mutants. arrest at the cdc <dig> arrest point was shown to depend on chk <dig>  <cit>  and rum <dig>  <cit> . arrest of orp <dig> mutant cells depends on the checkpoint rad proteins and on chk <dig>  <cit> . it should be noted that neither of these cell cycle mutants is able to replicate their dna at the restrictive temperature, and failure of the checkpoints responsible for cell cycle arrest results in aberrant entry into mitosis and not into s phase.

a g1/s checkpoint has so far not been detected in s. pombe. the drop of cdk activity at the m/g <dig> transition allows the assembly of the pre-replication complex, prerc, which is the first step leading to initiation of s phase. the prerc consists of the orc , cdc <dig>  cdt <dig> and the mcm proteins. expression of cdc <dig> and cdt <dig> is cell cycle regulated, thus providing one of the means to regulate initiation of s phase  <cit>  once the prerc is assembled, the chromatin is competent to replicate, but replication is not initiated until other replication proteins are loaded, and two kinases, cdc <dig> and hsk <dig>  are activated. it has been shown both in fission yeast and in xenopus that the intra-s phase checkpoint cannot be engaged until polα-primase is loaded and replication begins  <cit>  this observation poses the question whether the cells have any means to respond to dna damage sustained in g <dig> 

g <dig> in fission yeast is very short under standard laboratory growth conditions, rendering the investigation of a g1/s checkpoint difficult. however, g <dig> might be much extended in the natural habitat of s. pombe due to poor nutrient availability. we decided to use several approaches to synchronise the cells and/or to extend g <dig>  recently we reported the existence of a mechanism that delays entry into s phase when cycling cells are uv-irradiated in g <dig>  using cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> mutants to synchronise the cells or growing the cells in medium where g <dig> is extended  <cit> .

here we show that germinating s. pombe spores delay entry into s phase upon uv irradiation in early but not late g <dig>  we demonstrate that there is a g1/s delay that is not dependent on any of the known checkpoint proteins and does not target cdc <dig> phosphorylation. we argue that the delay is due to a novel mechanism that leads to delayed expression of cdt <dig> and possibly other replication proteins.

RESULTS
entry into s phase is delayed by uv irradiation
spores made from diploid cells were allowed to germinate for  <dig>  h at 30°c before uv irradiation. at this time point,  <dig> –  <dig> hours before s phase entry, the spores showed visible signs of germination by phase contrast microscopy. the dose of uv light was  <dig> j/m <dig>  which gave a cell survival of about 30% in wild type cells . at the time of irradiation, the majority of germinating spores had a 1c dna content. the timing of s phase was measured, by flow cytometry, as an increase in cellular dna content from 1c to 2c. the decrease of the 1c population was plotted against time, and the graphs for unirradiated control and uv irradiated cells were compared at the point where 50% of the cells had 1c dna content.

an inherent problem in the present experiments is that the time of germination varies both within each population of spores  and between the different preparations . thus, the time from resuspension in medium until the cells enter s phase is variable, and it is difficult to ensure that irradiation occurs at exactly the same time point relative to s phase entry. therefore the experiments were repeated at least twice and the averages were determined . the experiments revealed that uv irradiation made wild type cells delay their s phase entry by  <dig> minutes relative to unirradiated control cells . when the irradiated cells started to increase their dna content, they did not delay appreciably within s phase compared to unirradiated control cells, suggesting that when they started to synthesise dna, the dna damage had been removed. however, when the germinating spores were irradiated shortly before s phase entry, they entered s phase without a delay and were arrested with a dna content between 1c and 2c , presumably due to the intra-s checkpoint. indeed, the later the irradiation was performed the more pronounced the intra-s phase delay was . we conclude that cells irradiated in early g <dig> arrest temporarily with 1c dna content, then replicate their dna with normal timing. cells irradiated in late g <dig> exit from 1c with the same kinetics as unirradiated control cells do, but they are unable to complete s phase in normal time.

 the length of the delay was measured at the point where 50% of the cells had a 1c dna content on the quantitations. the second column shows the results of individual experiments, the third column shows the average lengths of the delay. irradiations were carried out  <dig>  hours after inoculation in medium, except for the entry "wt late irradiation", which was performed  <dig>  hours after inoculation.

the cells delay with low levels of cdt1
flow cytometry cannot distinguish between g <dig> and early s phase cells, therefore we sought to confirm that the cells arrest prior to s phase. prerc formation is a prerequisite for initiation of s phase. the first step towards prerc formation is de novo synthesis of cdc <dig> and cdt <dig>  which in turn are required for mcm loading. we investigated cdt <dig> levels in germinated spores treated as above to establish the timing of the 1c delay relative to cdt <dig> expression. wild type spores carrying myc-tagged cdt <dig> were uv irradiated as described above and samples of irradiated and control cells were removed for analysis by flow cytometry and by immunoblotting. cdt <dig> expression was induced already at  <dig> minutes in the control cells, but not until  <dig> minutes later in the uv irradiated cells . these observations suggest that cells irradiated in early g <dig> may delay entry into s phase at least in part by delaying prerc formation.

 the levels of cdt <dig> expression and cdc <dig> phosphorylation were quantified and the length of the delay was measured at the point where cdt <dig> expression and cdc <dig> phosphorylation, respectively, reached 50% of its maximal value. irradiations were carried out  <dig>  hours after inoculation in medium.

rum <dig> is required for part of the delay
rum <dig> inhibits the mitotic cdk, cdc2-cdc <dig>  and is required for efficient proteolysis of cdc <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, rum <dig> is required for all g <dig> arrests and delays investigated so far. we irradiated germinating rum1Δ spores as above and progression into s phase was followed by flow cytometry. irradiated spores delayed with a 1c dna content for  <dig> minutes . at the 60– <dig> minute timepoints the irradiated cells display a distinct delay in s phase, consistent with activation of the intra-s-phase checkpoint. the absence of rum <dig> shortens g <dig>  therefore some of the germinating spores were in fact in late g <dig> or early s at the time of irradiation, giving rise to significant activation of the intra-s-phase checkpoint.

rum <dig> expression is cell cycle regulated such that it is only expressed in g <dig>  <cit> . we investigated rum <dig> levels in germinated spores uv irradiated as described above and samples of irradiated and control cells were removed for analysis by flow cytometry and by immunoblotting. rum <dig> expression was induced at  <dig> minutes in both cultures, but was maintained to a higher extent and longer in the irradiated cells . both increased expression of rum <dig> and the requirement for rum <dig> for part of the delay demonstrate that part of the delay takes place in g <dig> 

is the 1c delay checkpoint dependent?
the definition of a checkpoint calls for the existence of mutations or chemicals that eliminate the delay. we addressed this issue by treating the germinating spores with caffeine. caffeine is known to abolish checkpoint function in both higher eukaryotes and fission yeast, possibly through the inhibition of rad <dig>  <cit> . caffeine was added to the culture  <dig> minutes before uv irradiation. flow cytometric analyses showed that the caffeine-treated spores entered s phase with the same kinetics as unirradiated cells . this observation indicates, , that the delay might be caused by a checkpoint mechanism.

given that caffeine can inhibit rad <dig> related kinases, we investigated whether the g1/s delay is also abolished in rad <dig> mutant cells. irradiated rad <dig> germinating spores delayed with a 1c dna content for  <dig> minutes, in contrast to the  <dig> minute delay of wild type cells .

we have investigated whether the other checkpoint rad proteins are involved in the g1/s delay. rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  hus <dig>  and rad <dig> spores were germinated and uv irradiated as described above. figure 4c  shows that rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  hus <dig> and rad <dig> cells delay much less than wild type cells do . we conclude that rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  hus <dig> and rad <dig> are required for at least a part of the 1c delay.

mrc <dig> and cds <dig>  but not crb <dig> and chk <dig>  are required for part of the delay
the products of the checkpoint genes cds <dig> and chk <dig> are both known downstream targets of the rad <dig> protein kinase and they are required for cdc <dig> phosphorylation in the dna damage and replication checkpoints. we irradiated germinating spores carrying mutations of cds <dig>  chk <dig> or both. in cds <dig> spores the delay was reduced to  <dig> minutes . in chk <dig> spores  the length of the delay was not reduced compared to that found in wild type cells. in cds <dig> chk <dig> double mutant spores the delay was somewhat shorter than in either single mutant,  <dig> minutes versus  <dig> and  <dig> minutes . the shorter delay in the cds <dig> chk <dig> double mutant compared to that in cds <dig> indicates that chk <dig> might have a synthetic effect with the cds <dig> mutation.

crb <dig> and mrc <dig> are required for activation of chk <dig> and cds <dig>  respectively. we irradiated germinating crb <dig> and mrc <dig> spores  <cit> . consistent with the above findings, in mrc <dig> the delay was reduced to  <dig> minutes, while in crb <dig> the delay was not reduced compared to that in wild type cells . we conclude that mrc <dig> and cds <dig> are required for part of the delay, while crb <dig> and chk <dig> are not required.

the arrested cells maintain cdc <dig> in the unphosphorylated form
cdc <dig> kinase activity is required for the initiation of s phase and is inhibited by phosphorylation on tyr <dig> as dna replication commences  <cit> . we investigated whether the cdc <dig> protein is phosphorylated when the cells are delayed with a 1c dna content. germinating wild type spores were treated as above and samples of irradiated and control cells were removed for analysis by flow cytometry and by immunoblotting. the results show an increase in the phosphorylation signal as the unirradiated cells enter s phase , in agreement with previous findings  <cit>  the irradiated cells increased phosphorylation of cdc <dig>  <dig> minutes later . we conclude that the irradiated cells arrest with a 1c dna content for a significant length of time with unphosphorylated cdc <dig> 

res <dig> mutant cells do not delay s phase entry after irradiation
a number of genes required for dna replication are transcribed as the cells prepare for s phase. this activation depends on the cell cycle regulated transcription factor cdc10/res1/res <dig>  <cit> . in the absence of res <dig>  transcription is constitutively active  <cit> . if the g1/s delay in fission yeast cells is brought about by inhibiting this transcription factor, constitutive activation of transcription in a res <dig> mutant should override the uv-induced g <dig> delay. we have irradiated germinating res2Δ spores as described above and found that s phase entry was not delayed compared to unirradiated control cells .

cdc <dig> dependent transcription is not inhibited during the delay
the above result indicates that either constitutive expression of cdc <dig> dependent genes required for s phase entry can override the delay or inhibiting cdc <dig> dependent transcription might be the mechanism of the delay. a prediction of the latter alternative is that cells arrested with 1c dna content upon uv irradiation should not have performed the cdc10-dependent transcriptional events, including induction of the cdc <dig>  cdt <dig>  and cig <dig> genes. we isolated total rna from irradiated and unirradiated germinating wild type spores and followed the transcription of cig <dig>  cdt <dig> and cdc <dig>  there was no delay in the appearance of the cdc <dig> dependent transcripts upon uv irradiation . we conclude that cdc <dig> dependent transcription is not the mechanism of the delay.

discussion
we have provided evidence for the existence of a mechanism in germinating fission yeast spores that delays entry into s phase upon uv irradiaton in early g <dig>  germinating wild type spores displayed a pronounced delay in entering s phase after uv irradiation. the delay was observed only when irradiation was carried out in early but not in late g <dig>  we have investigated the dependence of the delay on classical checkpoint proteins and showed that they are required for some but not all of the delay with 1c dna content. we argue that the observed delay is caused by two separate mechanisms, the first taking place before entry into s phase, and the second in early s phase .

the delay in exit from the 1c population was demonstrated by means of flow cytometry, which does not allow us to distinguish between a g1/s and an early s delay. the following data represent strong evidence that part of the delay takes place before entry into s phase. first, the irradiated cells delay expression of cdt <dig>  in the absence of cdt <dig> the cells cannot form prercs and thus cannot initiate s phase. second, the irradiated cells express rum <dig> longer than unirradiated control cells. since rum <dig> expression is cell cycle regulated such that it is only expressed in g <dig>   <cit> , this observation implies that the irradiated cells do delay in g <dig>  furthermore, the delay is shorter in a rum <dig> mutant, which presumably loses the g <dig> part of the delay. third, mutants lacking mrc <dig> or cds <dig>  which are essential for s-phase checkpoints reported so far in fission yeast  <cit> , still delay for a significant length of time, pointing to the existence of a non-s mechanism  <cit> . fourth, cells delay with the cdc <dig> kinase in an unphosphorylated state. cdc <dig> is normally inhibited by phosphorylation on tyr <dig> as dna replication commences  <cit> , arguing that the cells arrest before s phase. fifth, the delay is not observed in a res <dig> mutant, which can not turn off the cdc <dig> dependent transcription signal. the finding that a mutation affecting expression of proteins crucial for preparation for s phase abolishes the delay argues that the wild type cells first stop in g <dig> and only later stop in s phase.

on the basis of these results we conclude that there is a uv-induced g <dig> delay, which is not checkpoint rad dependent and is brought about by an as yet undescribed mechanism. this part of the total delay with 1c dna content is ca  <dig> minutes, since rad, cds <dig> and mrc <dig> mutants delay 30– <dig> minutes and rum1Δ cells lose ca  <dig> minutes of the delay, compared to wild type cells. the remaining ca  <dig> minutes of the total delay requires the checkpoint rads, mrc <dig>  cds <dig> and cdc <dig> is phosphorylated. we argue that this part of the delay is brought about by the intra-s checkpoint. however, the resolution of our experiments is not high enough to exclude the possibility that some of the checkpoint rad- and cds1-dependent part of the delay occurs in late g <dig>  we consider this possibility unlikely for two reasons; first, previous work has shown that the role of cds <dig> is specific for s phase  <cit>  and second, we have shown in the current paper that if irradiation occurs later, the cells enter s phase without delay and delay in s phase.

since the level of synchrony is low in germinating spores, we have not emphasised minor differences in the timing of s phase entry. in spite of poor synchrony, we deem germinating spores a good model system, since spore germination is a natural phenomenon, it involves an extended g <dig> period and we observed clear-cut effects. furthermore, this model system allowed us to investigate the effects of a number of mutations that would have not been possible using synchronisation by other methods.

we have explored whether the g1/s delay is caused by a checkpoint mechanism. we have shown that caffeine abolishes the delay, but this is not entirely due to inhibition of rad <dig> activity, since a rad <dig> mutation does not abolish all of the g1/s delay. since we have not identified a checkpoint mutation which abolishes the delay, we attribute the effect of caffeine to another effect than the inhibition of checkpoint proteins. interestingly, recent data suggest that caffeine inhibits checkpoint responses without inhibiting the atr and atm kinases in human cells  <cit> .

previously, rhind and russell  <cit>  showed that uv-irradiation during g <dig> delays passage through s-phase. however, this checkpoint arrests cells in s phase, requires cds <dig> function and probably represents the intra-s checkpoint.

we have recently discovered a mechanism that delays entry into s phase in cells irradiated in early g <dig> in synchronised or in cycling cells  <cit>  this inhibitory mechanism has several features in common with that described here. both pathways are activated in early but not in late g1; both inhibit entry into s phase; both pathways are independent of classical checkpoint genes and of cdc <dig> phosphorylation. these similarities argue that the g1/s mechanism demonstrated in germinating spores and in cycling cells is one and the same.

in budding yeast there is a g <dig> dna damage checkpoint response that depends upon mec <dig>  <cit> , a homologue of the mammalian atm/atr and the fission yeast rad <dig> protein. however, the budding yeast g <dig> checkpoint response depends on rad <dig>  <cit> , whereas its homologue in s. pombe, cds <dig>  is not involved in the present pathway. the budding yeast g1/s checkpoint delays entry into s phase by phosphorylating and thereby downregulating swi <dig>  the homologue of cdc <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, in fission yeast cdc <dig> dependent transcription is not delayed during the g1/s delay .

other possible mechanisms for the g1/s delay include inhibition of cdc <dig> by rum <dig> or an as yet unidentified mechanism such as preventing the formation of cdc2-cyclin complexes or by restricting the availability of cyclins. we have shown that rum <dig> is expressed during the delay and is required for the g <dig> delay. this observation does not imply that rum <dig> is a direct target of the g1/s delay, but this remains an attractive possibility. another possible mechanism for the delay is delaying expression of proteins required for the initiation of dna replication. in particular, the findings that  irradiation in late g <dig> does not cause a delayed entry into s phase,  increased transcription of cdc <dig> dependent genes in res2Δ overrides the delay,  transcription of cdc <dig> dependent genes is not downregulated during the delay and  expression of cdt <dig> is delayed, suggest that the g1/s delay is caused by delayed expression of cdt <dig> and probably also of cdc <dig> and cig <dig>  since we have shown that transcription of cdc <dig> regulated genes is not downregulated, the most likely mechanism of the delay is reduced translation rate of cdt <dig> and possibly other proteins required for initiation of dna replication.

CONCLUSIONS
we studied the response of schizosaccharomyces pombe cells to uv irradiation in g <dig>  we used germinating spores to exploit a natural phenomenon where the cells have a long g <dig>  in this paper we provide evidence for the existence of a mechanism in fission yeast that delays entry into s phase upon uv irradiaton in early g <dig>  the g <dig> delay is independent of classical checkpoint proteins and cdc <dig> phosphorylation. our results point to a mechanism that delays translation of proteins required for s phase entry.
