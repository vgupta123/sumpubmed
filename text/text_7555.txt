BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of small rnas , generally 21- <dig> nucleotide in length, involved in post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of several processes, including the response to biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . in plants, mirnas derive from non-coding transcripts produced from mir genes, mainly located in intergenic regions. the primary transcripts  possess internal stem-loop secondary structures, which form parts of double-stranded rna  not perfectly complementary to mirna, contained in one of the two arms of the stem-loop structure. the pri-mirna is processed into a stem-loop precursor , which is cut by the enzyme dcl <dig> into a small dsrna, composed of the mature mirna and its complementary sequence . the couple mirna/mirna* contains protruding extremities, with two unaligned nucleotides at the 3' end. after incorporation into ago <dig> protein complex, plant mature mirnas target mrnas, which are cleaved by ago <dig> at a specific position, opposite to the 10th and 11th nucleotides of the mirna  <cit> .

in plants,  <dig> mirna families are highly conserved and can be found even in distantly related species. however, there is a number of species-specific mirnas originating from recently evolved mir genes  <cit> . young mirnas are usually associated with low expression levels  <cit> , and are therefore difficult to detect using conventional methods for mirna identification.

for the isolation of mirnas in a plant species, one of the approaches, followed since the beginning in arabidopsis and rice, is based on cloning and sequencing small rna fractions  <cit> . once mirna sequences have accumulated in the public databases, computational strategies have been developed to identify mirnas by sequence comparison. conserved mirna sequences from mirbase  are blasted against available genomic/mrna sequences and searched for sequence similarity  <cit> . both these approaches are able to detect the most abundant mirnas belonging to the most ancient and conserved families  <cit> . more recently, the preferred strategy for the discovery of mirnas has been based on deep sequencing; in this case, even poorly expressed mirnas can be detected, therefore allowing the discovery of novel species-specific mirnas  <cit> .

it is well known that plants cope with saline stress by activating a number of genes involved in a broad spectrum of metabolisms  <cit> , and mirnas are involved in the response to environmental stresses  <cit> . most studies have been conducted in arabidopsis, where the expression of several mirnas has been associated to drought tolerance  <cit> . mirnas involved in the response to salt treatment have been described, besides arabidopsis  <cit> , also in crop species  <cit> .

globe artichoke is an important vegetable crop in the mediterranean region from where it originated  <cit> , and is also widely cultivated in california, peru and china . artichoke is considered a nutraceutical food since it possesses antioxidant activity attributed to the presence of polyphenols, particularly caffeoylquinic acids and flavonoids  <cit> .

although artichoke can be regarded as a moderately salt resistant crop, the need to maintain low soil salinity levels is essential for maximum yields, since when salt concentration becomes too high, the size of the buds decreases  <cit> . in the areas where artichoke is more diffused, the increase of saline content in the soils and/or in the water used for irrigation can be a serious problem in a perspective of global climate change. therefore, understanding which are the mechanisms superintending saline response is of pivotal importance for developing strategies for plant cultivation in future times.

in this study, we deep sequenced the srna fraction from leaves and roots of globe artichoke, under standard conditions and under salt stress. putative mirna sequences were blasted against artichoke ests and illumina genomic sequences obtained by our group  <cit> . these analyses led to the identification of  <dig>  artichoke mirnas, following stringent criteria. in some cases, mir genes were detected and mirna folding structure predicted. some mirnas were experimentally validated and their differential expression level was assessed by means of quantitative real-time pcr . target prediction was performed and, when possible, target cleavage was experimentally validated.

RESULTS
artichoke srna population
to discover the artichoke mirnaome and the possible involvement of mirnas in the response to saline stress, four srna libraries were generated from leaves and roots of young artichoke plants subjected or not to nacl treatment. deep sequencing yielded a total of almost  <dig> million reads . after removing low quality reads, adapter sequences, and sequences shorter than  <dig> or longer than  <dig> nucleotides, reads were about  <dig> million  for control plant  leaves, almost  <dig> million  for stressed plant  leaves, almost  <dig> million  for cp roots, and about  <dig> million  for sp roots . the length distribution of unique reads revealed a non homogeneous pattern, the majority of srnas in all libraries  being 20- <dig> nucleotide in length with 24-nt long srnas as the main peak . reads from all artichoke libraries were annotated according to small non-coding rnas contained in rfam . as a result,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % reads matching known srnas were identified in cp leaves, sp leaves, cp roots and sp roots, respectively. the most abundant class was rrna, in agreement with the method used to obtain srna fraction for library preparation. trnas ranged from a minimum of  <dig> % in cp roots to a maximum of  <dig> % in sp roots; snrna and snorna seemed to be equally distributed in the four srna libraries.

discovery of artichoke conserved and novel mirnas
to identify artichoke mirnas conserved also in other plant species, all previously known plant sequences were extracted from the mirna registry database , accounting for a total of  <dig>  annotated mirnas from  <dig> plant species. as a result,  <dig> known mirnas  were identified in artichoke, with  <dig> of them being shared by all four srna libraries . the artichoke mirnas were named using the initials of the species  followed by the number  assigned to the same mirna in other plant species.

the  <dig> known artichoke mirnas belonged to  <dig> families, of which  <dig> had at least two members, while  <dig> had only one member . highly represented mirna families showed one or more dominant members with high read counts  and less represented members having few read counts .

conserved mirnas identified by deep sequencing were used for blastn search against public artichoke ests and our proprietary illumina genomic sequences, and the matching sequences were subjected to mfold analysis for fold-back structure prediction. after these analyses,  <dig> pre-mirnas were identified, corresponding to  <dig> different mirna families . mature mirnas were either located in the 5' or in the 3' arm of the pre-mirna sequences . in three cases, namely cca-mir <dig>  cca-mir169a, and cca-mir395b, two distinct sequences corresponding to putative precursors for each mirna were found, therefore, following instructions in mirbase, we considered them as distinct mirnas: cca-mirna160- <dig> and 160-2; cca-mirna169a- <dig> and 169a-2; cca-mir395b- <dig> and cca-mir395b- <dig>

out of the  <dig> conserved mirnas identified in artichoke,  <dig> were in common with several plant species, while  <dig> were present in only one of the  <dig> species in mirbase release  <dig> . thirty-four mirnas showed to be highly conserved not only among closely related species, but also between dicots and monocots .

to compare mirna abundance in different libraries, the count of each mirna was normalized to transcripts per million , after filtering rrna, trna, snrna, snorna. change in mirna read counts between stressed and non stressed tissues in both leaves and root was recorded. on this basis, after saline treatment,  <dig> or  <dig> conserved mirnas showed a significantly different frequency , in leaves or roots, respectively .

in order to identify novel artichoke mirnas, after excluding rfam matching srnas and conserved mirnas, srna sequences were used to blastn search on artichoke ests and illumina genomic sequences. sequences containing potential new mirnas were sent for secondary structure prediction. the fundamental criteria for a novel mirna annotation was the occurrence of the mirna/mirna* duplex in a qualified stem-loop fold back structure  <cit> . eight novel mirnas were identified based on this evidence . additional  <dig> sequences were also proposed to be novel artichoke mirnas since, although not supported by the presence of mirna*, they satisfied the secondary structure criteria and were retrieved from more than one srna library  <cit>  . for cca-novel- <dig>  three distinct mirnas  were considered, since they were coded by three different mir genes. in agreement with previous results  <cit> , the majority of the newly identified mirna sequences had an uracil  as their first nucleotide .

experimental validation and qpcr expression of selected mirnas
qpcr was used to assay expression levels of  <dig>  mirnas in artichoke leaves and roots from cp and sp using a stem-loop rt-pcr approach  <cit>  . the cycle threshold  value used for expression analysis for each mirna and tissue was obtained by averaging the ct values derived from all the biological and experimental replicates. expression changes for each mirna were determined by arbitrarily setting the value in cp tissues as  <dig>  and measuring the concentration in sp samples as fold change by means of the comparative quantitation method. data were corrected using actin and elongation factor as housekeeping genes. to verify amplicon size, qpcr products were separated on agarose gel .

results of qpcr evidenced that a total of  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were significantly up or down regulated in artichoke leaves or roots, respectively. however, a two-fold or greater  expression difference between cp and sp was observed only for two mirnas in leaves  and for  <dig> mirnas in roots, with mir171a and 319a being particularly abundant with an expression level >  <dig> fold change in this tissue . cca-mir393a was slightly up-regulated in sp leaves, while no amplification was observed in roots in our experimental conditions for both treated and untreated plants.

target prediction and validation
in total, we identified  <dig> artichoke sequences  carrying a region of high complementarity with the previously identified mirnas. after removing redundant sequences, only putative mirna targets homologous to described arabidopsis proteins  were retained, for a total of  <dig> sequences,  <dig> matching conserved and  <dig> matching novel artichoke mirnas . several cca-mirnas  were predicted to target known transcription factors  controlling gene expression related with plant development, morphology, and flowering time. some of these tfs were auxin response factor involved in developmental growth, scarecrow , squamosa promoter binding , nac  and ap <dig>  domain containing protein . cca-mir169a targeted a nuclear transcritption factor y involved in response to drought in arabidopsis  <cit> . two putative targets  were homologous to members of laccase gene family, which has been demonstrated to be involved in salt stress response  <cit> , as well as superoxide dismutase, the target gene for cca-mir398b  <cit> . cca-mir <dig> targeted a sequence similar to ago <dig>  a member of the argonaute gene family. among novel mirnas, predicted target genes for cca-novel-9-3p  and cca-novel-13-3p are involved in response to cadmium exposure ; mirna cca-novel- <dig> was predicted to target an aspartic proteinase apa <dig> involved in salt stress response; cca-novel- <dig> target  has been shown to be involved in the response to biotic  stress; cca-novel- <dig> targets an l-ascorbate peroxidase which plays a role in response to oxidative stress, as suggested by go term association, while cca-novel- <dig> targets a sequence homologus to rubisco activase which has been demonstrated to be involved in the response to temperature variation and other stresses  <cit> . five artichoke mirna targets, localized in the chloroplast according to go, were predicted to be involved in electron transport or catalytic activity, while for  <dig> mirna targets no function category was retrieved .

for a subset of artichoke mirnas, the cleavage of putative targets was evaluated by 5' race assay. for cca-mir <dig> target, an auxin responsive factor, a fragment of the size corresponding to the cleaved sequence was observed on agarose gel . sequence of the 5' race cleaved product confirmed a precise slice at the mirna binding site, between position  <dig> and  <dig>  analysis for putative targets of cca-mir <dig> and cca-mir <dig> revealed no evidence of 3' cleaved product, and only fragments corresponding to unprocessed target sequence were detected for both targets . uncleaved transcripts were confirmed by sequencing.

tir1-like  sequence, the putative target of cca-mir393a, was also evaluated for its cleavage site. electrophoretic profile of race products highlighted a fragment of a size compatible with the mirna cleavage . however, when we cloned and sequenced eight clones carrying the gel purified pcr product, we observed a fragment cleaved in a different position from the expected one. all sequences were sliced  <dig> nucleotides downstream the canonical mirna-target duplex region . furthermore, in order to find any other srna matching this cleaved tir1-like sequence, we aligned all our srna illumina reads on the cleaved target and found  <dig>  22-nt long srnas mapping on both sense and antisense strands of artichoke tir1-like sequence, downstream the cca-mir <dig> predicted cleavage site, with a particular abundance of a sequence mapping in position 190- <dig> . these srna reads were detected in libraries from stressed and non stressed leaves but not in root tissues.

discussion
the existence of orthologous conserved mirnas in a plant species can be easily confirmed by using computational approaches, due to high conservation of many mature mirnas across a wide range of plant species  <cit> , or by traditional sanger sequencing. yet, following these strategies, species-specific mirnas, which are generally poorly expressed, cannot be easily detected. thousands of mirnas from several plant species have been to date described and partly characterized. for artichoke, however, mirnas have not been released yet.

the genome of globe artichoke has been scarcely characterized so far, and sequences available in the public databases are limited to about  <dig>  ests and just a few genomic and mrna sequences. in order to isolate and analyze the mirnaome of artichoke, we used a deep sequencing approach on four srna libraries obtained from two tissues, leaves and roots, in standard conditions and under saline treatment. like for several other plant species, 24-nt srnas were the most abundant size class; this result is consistent with the typical size of dicer digestion products  <cit> . we compared the obtained srna sequences not only to the public artichoke ests, but also to a quite large set of proprietary illumina sequences representing about  <dig>  × coverage of the artichoke genome. this procedure allowed us to discover and describe, for the first time, a total of  <dig> artichoke mirnas including  <dig> known and  <dig> novel ones. conserved mirnas were detected in very stringent conditions, by considering only perfect matching sequences, without permitting any mismatch. the characteristic stem-loop secondary structure of pre-mirna allows to distinguish mirnas from other small rnas such as short-interfering rnas   <cit> . for novel mirnas, the primary criterion for annotation is the finding of the corresponding mirna* in sequencing data sets. in the absence of the mirna*, the discovery of new mirnas can be supported by the identification of the stem-loop structure together with the presence in multiple, independent libraries  <cit> .

it is well known that most mir genes map in regions annotated as intergenic or non protein coding genes. however, mirna precursors complementary to protein coding genes or matching to introns can also be found  <cit> . since the artichoke genome is only partially known , we could not study the genomic organization of artichoke mirnas.

although estimation of expression levels can be performed from sequencing reads, we validated levels of expressions for a number of conserved and novel artichoke mirnas by qpcr, since no biological or experimental replicates had been used for sequencing. results were not always consistent between the two approaches. we will therefore mainly discuss expression levels obtained from qpcr experiments. we used the comparative quantitation method which does not require any extra rt-pcr reactions to calculate pcr efficiencies, is cheaper, less time consuming and uses fewer reagents compared to the more commonly used comparative threshold cycle method  <cit> . in general, the magnitude of variation in expression levels for artichoke mirnas after salt stress seemed to be more pronounced in roots than in leaves.

some of the artichoke conserved mirnas here validated had already been tested in other species in response to salt stress. most studies are referred to arabidopsis, where mir <dig> and  <dig> were up-regulated following saline treatment, as in both artichoke tissues; in other cases there is a good correspondence only with one of the artichoke tissues , whereas, for some other mirnas  the regulation after salt stress was opposite in arabidopsis compared to artichoke . however, also some mirnas from other plant species have displayed a response to salt treatment different from that of arabidopsis; this is the case of maize , populus , and medicago truncatula   <cit> . interestingly, in m. truncatula, mir <dig> was down regulated in roots, like in artichoke.

several evidences have shown that most plant mirnas function by either perfectly or near-perfectly binding to complementary sites on their target mrna sequences  <cit> . this provides a powerful way to identify potential targets simply by aligning and comparing mirnas with a set of available sequences. since few protein-coding genes have been reported for artichoke so far, all ests and proprietary illumina genomic sequences were used for target prediction. detection of artichoke putative targets was performed in stringent conditions, and only genes matching to described arabidopsis proteins were considered. most targets identified in this study were tfs, as also observed for other species. in fact, many studies have demonstrated, by experimental and computational approaches, that mirnas target prevalently tfs involved in plant development control. in addition, many other predicted artichoke targets were homologous to proteins involved in plant response to several abiotic and biotic stresses; this is the case also for putative targets of novel artichoke mirnas .

as for conserved mirnas, cca-mir <dig> possessed different isoforms recognizing distinct targets . as proposed for mir169a and its nfy-a tf targets for drought response and abscisic acid signaling, different isoforms of mirnas might regulate distinct target genes and define complex specificities at spatio-temporal level  <cit> .

for some artichoke mirnas regulated following saline stress, targets could not be identified possibly because the artichoke genome is still largely unexplored. however, members of mir <dig> and  <dig> families targeted nac and ap <dig> tfs, respectively; mir <dig> and  <dig> families targeted members of the laccase gene family, and mir <dig> family, a superoxide dismutase. laccases are multicopper-containing glycoproteins, widespread in plants. many physiological functions have been associated with laccases, particularly lignin biosynthesis  <cit>  and formation of proanthocyanidin or tannin  <cit> . moreover, laccase, like other polyphenol oxidases, is believed to be responsible for polymerization of phenolic compounds which protect plants from pathogen and insect attack  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that the transcript level of laccase genes is enhanced by high concentrations of nacl in tomato, maize, and arabidopsis roots  <cit> , suggesting that an increase in laccase transcript level in roots under salinity stress could be a universal response in plants. in artichoke, a down-regulation of mir397a in roots might possibly lead to a higher expression of laccase in this organ, particularly involved in the response to salt stress.

mir <dig> expression level has been shown to be affected by salt stress treatment, as well as by other abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . we found a contrasting behavior in leaves  compared to roots . when arabidopsis seedlings were analysed after imposing nacl treatment, a slight increase in mir <dig> expression was observed, accompanied by a low decrease in the expression of its target, superoxide dismutase. however, it has also been shown that distinct members of the superoxide dismutase family can display a different behavior following salt stress  <cit> .

mir <dig> validated target is ago <dig> mrna  <cit> . this interaction mirna/mrna is likely to be involved in a multiple layer rna-mediated defense and counter-defense in the interactions between plants and their viruses, as recently reported in arabidopsis  <cit> . in this model, ago <dig> acts in the first layer in defense against viruses, while ago <dig> is involved in the second layer limiting virus accumulation. when the primary ago1-mediated mechanism is overcome by viral suppressors of silencing the second layer is activated because ago <dig> is no longer repressed by ago <dig> via mir <dig> 

5' race approach can unambiguously diagnose one of the mechanisms of action of mirnas, by endonucleatic cleavage at the pairing site of mirna with its target  <cit>  and has been successfully used for both total and poly-selected rna templates  <cit> . however, in our study, not all the targets tested showed the expected cleaved fragment, possibly because translational repression of targets might be the preferred mechanism of action for some mirnas. in fact, notwithstanding almost perfect complementarity between mirna and its target sequence in plants, it has been demonstrated that likewise in animals, non-cleaving repression is a possible mechanism also in the plant kingdom  <cit> . moreover, it has been hypothesized that at times, the mechanisms of slicing and translational repression might be spatially or temporally separated  <cit> .

for artichoke mir <dig> putative target, tir <dig>  we observed a  <dig> nucleotide shorter cleaved sequence after 5' race analysis. as previously reported in arabidopsis, this can be attributed to secondary sirna in the 21-nucleotide register with the cleavage site for mir <dig>  <cit> . in some cases, in fact, after mirna-directed cleavage, sliced target rnas can generate secondary phased sirnas. after cleavage, the targeted rna is converted into dsrna by rna-dependent rna polymerases , which is then sliced into secondary sirnas by dicer-like  nucleases  <cit> . most mirna-targeted rnas do not generate secondary sirnas, suggesting the existence of additional determinants of secondary sirna production. a "two-hit" model to explain this secondary effect of mirna mediated cleavage is based on the evidence that two mirna target sites are critical for tas <dig> tasirna production between the two sites  <cit> . this model, however, does not explain secondary sirna triggering by single site mirna targets as for mir <dig> targeting tir <dig> transcript. recently, it has been suggested that, in arabidopsis, secondary sirna triggers are represented as 22-nt mirnas rather than the canonical 21-nt long mirnas  <cit> . mir <dig> target tir1-like protein is well conserved in many plant species and is involved in the response to auxin stimulus in concert with the aux/iaa transcriptional repressors  <cit> . sirnas from tir <dig> were shown to be in 21-nucleotide register with the upstream mirna cleavage site predicted by the sequence of mir <dig>  here we reported the same behavior for artichoke tir1-like sequence, suggesting that this mechanism can be a general one, diffused in all plant species.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we analysed the mirnaome of globe artichoke, detecting conserved and novel mirnas for artichoke. some of them were differentially regulated in leaves or roots in standard conditions or after imposing saline stress. putative targets were identified and some of them were validated for their cleavage site. interestingly, we could demonstrate that also in artichoke, tir <dig> gene, the putative target for mir <dig>  generates secondary sirnas.
