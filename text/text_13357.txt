BACKGROUND
selection acts differently on different proteins, depending on their function. understanding mechanisms underlying these differences has been a major thrust in molecular evolutionary biology . a dominant pattern observed in studies of diverse model systems, ranging from yeast to mammals, is that secreted proteins evolve faster than intracellular proteins . reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. non-adaptive explanations posit that extracellular proteins experience relaxed selection, and are more tolerant of mutations for structural, ecological, or evolutionary reasons  <cit> . alternatively, extracellular proteins may play a larger role in evolutionary interactions with the environment and other organisms, which should make them more likely targets of positive selection  <cit> , as predicted by coevolutionary theory  <cit> .

in our view this uncertainty results from methodologies used in previous studies, which focused on large-scale analysis of evolutionary rate correlates. although some authors could identify major genome-wide patterns, given the large number of genes involved, they could not determine proximal ecological factors that drive selection acting on extracellular gene products. here we use snake venoms as a model system to illuminate the interplay between ecology and evolutionary rates of secreted proteins. consisting of analytically tractable numbers of components with distinct pharmacological roles, snake venom proteomes have well-defined ecological roles in the immobilization of prey. thus, comparing the composition of snake venoms between species as a function of prey choice and venom protein expression level, can provide general insights into how secreted proteins evolve.

snake venoms function as integrated systems. roles of individual constituents depend upon their concentrations and their interactions with other venom components  <cit> . moreover, venom constituents also interact with compounds in prey tissues, most often in highly specific ways. snake venom composition must respond to ontogenetic and evolutionary changes in diet, and presumably must also compensate to overcome predator or prey resistance, should that develop . as a result, venoms from different species, and even those from different populations of the same species, appear optimally targeted to the chemistries of specific prey species. furthermore, the structures of snake venom proteins evolve extremely rapidly , suggesting intense, positive, darwinian selection. consisting of mixtures of specific, evolutionarily conserved compounds with discrete pharmacologies, snake venoms provide an unusual opportunity to quantitatively study genomic consequences of ecological interactions, particularly how natural selection acts on rapidly co-evolving gene complexes.

numerous and diverse studies attest to the strength of selection operating on venom composition. various studies document a close match between venom composition and its effectiveness in subduing prey, suggestive of adaptation by the snakes. for example, mackessy  <cit>  showed that northern and southern pacific rattlesnakes  exhibit a pronounced shift in venom chemistry when young adults switch from lizard to rodent prey. the venom becomes less toxic, but much more proteolytic, presumably to enhance digestion of more voluminous prey with much smaller surface-to-volume ratios  <cit> , although mccue  <cit>  has disputed this conclusion. daltry et al.  <cit>  opined that venom variation in the malayan pitviper  is closely associated with diet. chijiwa and colleagues  <cit>  documented stark differences in venom phospholipases a <dig>  in populations of habus  on different islands in the ryukyu archipelago. they inferred that these compositional differences reflect different selective pressures related to preferred prey. experimental studies have shown that coral snake venoms are most toxic to preferred prey organisms  <cit> . gibbs and mackessy  <cit>  found that toxicity of four pygmy rattlesnake  venoms was correlated with the proportion of mice and lizards in the diet, with each taxon being most toxic to its preferred prey species. conversely, the sea snake, aipysurus eydouxii, feeds exclusively on fish eggs, obviating the necessity of venom. as a result, selection on its venom pla2s has relaxed, leading to a range of dysfunctional mutations  <cit> .

in addition, many studies that focused on individual toxins or toxin classes have discovered evidence of accelerated protein sequence evolution, consistent with positive selection. it is well documented that contrary to normal tissue isozymes, venom protein exons diversify much more rapidly than introns . in most venomous snakes, toxin gene duplication followed by neofunctionalization, has resulted in diverse pharmacologies  <cit> . as an example, pla2s manifest presynaptic neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, anticoagulation, and cause vascular perforation , hemolysis, and pain . although not as well studied as pla2s, other snake toxin classes including cysteine-rich secretory proteins , disintegrins, c-type lectins, serine proteases, metalloproteases, and three-finger toxins all show evidence of rapid gene diversification, or of positive darwinian selection . moreover, the most rapidly evolving residues are those that appear on toxin surfaces, controlling their interactions with molecular targets in prey organisms  <cit> .

some have suggested that accelerated evolution is predominantly a product of intrinsic mechanisms that enhance genetic diversity, independent of selective pressures. kini and chan  <cit>  reasoned that accelerated evolution results from relaxed rather than directional selection. mebs  <cit>  argued that there is no evidence that strong selective forces drive the development of more potent toxins to overcome prey resistance, or to exploit new biochemical pathways for more effective intoxication of prey. more recently kini and chinnasamy  <cit>  proposed that triplet nucleotide sequences determine the spontaneous mutation rate, an idea that requires further consideration.

in addition, phylogeny clearly plays a role in venom composition. more closely related species generally have more similar venoms than more distantly related species . however, geography, and reduced gene flow may also influence venom chemistry. angulo et al.  <cit>  found pronounced differences in venom composition  between atropoides nummifer and atropoides picadoi. since adults of both species are predominantly rodent predators, the differences appear to have a phylogenetic, rather than an ecological or geographic basis. however, the earlier work of jiménez-porras makes it clear that geographic separation of conspecific populations also affects venom composition in a. nummifer  <cit> . angulo et al. did not indicate the geographic origins of their specimens, except to say that all were collected in costa rica.

although toxin components interact to immobilize prey  <cit> , historically, most studies of snake venom constituents have focused on specific toxin classes, examining long-term evolutionary trends in a variety of snake taxa. consequently, although macroevolutionary patterns of individual venom proteins are somewhat understood, their regulation and microevolution remain almost entirely unknown  <cit> . however, if individual toxins  fluctuate in abundance and importance over short evolutionary time scales  <cit> , evolutionary analysis of individual venom constituents may be misleading, as individual genes may experience different selective pressures from lineage to lineage. furthermore, rates of venom protein evolution may depend on the relative abundance of various venom protein classes, and on their relative importance in immobilizing the prey.

here we examine the interplay between component abundance and evolutionary rate, using two closely related pitviper species, the habu  and the sakishima habu . the former is native to okinawa and nearby islands, and the latter to the yaeyama islands, located 400 km to the southwest in the ryukyu archipelago. the sakishima habu is most closely related to the taiwan habu   <cit> , which is not surprising since it occupies the ryukyu islands closest to taiwan. in  <dig>  however, human activities released approximately  <dig> sakishima habus in the vicinity of itoman, okinawa . the geological isolation of the yaeyamas and okinawa, is estimated at about  <dig>  million years, which matches patterns of divergence of several island endemics , though molecular estimates place divergence between these species at about  <dig> million years  <cit> .

between  <dig> and  <dig>  more than  <dig> sakishima habus were captured and brought to the prefectural institute of health and environment  <cit> . during this same period, five specimens of intermediate morphology were collected, suggesting possible hybridization. recent collection of two more intermediate specimens prompted us to investigate whether these specimens are actual hybrids. using a combination of transcriptomic and quantitative proteomic techniques  <cit> , we identified venom components and determined their abundances in three specimens each of both parental species, and in the two putative hybrids, all collected in the same local area . because the putative hybrids are rare, and could not be sacrificed for venom gland extraction, we used only proteomic analysis of their venoms. we confirmed that they are genuine hybrids; however, serendipitously, these data also revealed some surprising patterns in the tempo and pattern of secreted protein evolution. thus, an ostensibly simple question of possible pitviper hybridization unexpectedly illuminated fundamental evolutionary principles, which we could then verify in other species. here then, are both intertwined stories.fig.  <dig> photographs of the two parental species and a hybrid between them. a

RESULTS
we used a combination of transcriptomic and proteomic techniques to characterize the venoms of two closely related habus. by combining both approaches, we benefitted from the dynamic range and accuracy of transcriptomics, while proteomic data distinguished between proteins secreted into the venom, and non-venom components, allowing us to contrast evolutionary patterns in the two classes of genes. in addition, proteomics permitted us to quantify venom composition in rare and valuable hybrid specimens that could not be sacrificed for gland extraction. unexpectedly, however, these hybrids provided insights into venom level regulation and evolution, showing heritability and additive regulation of venom component expression levels.

we also found a positive correlation between abundance of venom gene transcripts, and their evolutionary rates. this result is not obvious, given the non-stoichiometric action of enzymatic snake venom components, but it suggests that venomous snakes invest more in the production of proteins that are particularly important to them. consequently, these proteins experience high rates of evolution, often with ω >  <dig>  and show evidence of positive selection . we propose that regulation of venom constituent levels may be a major short-term mechanism by which snakes adapt to new prey types, and may be a driver of protein molecular evolution.

the two protobothops venoms were qualitatively similar at the level of protein families, and had many one-to-one gene homologs . both venoms were heavily dominated by phospholipases a <dig>  serine proteases, metalloproteases, and bpp-cnp, in that order . protobothrops flavoviridis venom possesses factor ix/x inactivators that are absent in p. elegans venom. lao transcripts were 6× more abundant in habu venom and vegf transcripts were 3× as numerous . toxins having the primary function of hypotension or anti-coagulation, account for at least 21 % more of the p. flavoviridis transcriptome than the p. elegans transcriptome . presently, it is not possible to know whether any of the phospholipases a <dig> in either venom are anticoagulant; however, zhao et al.  <cit>  present strong evidence that catalytic activity is required for anticoagulant activity. this implies that the major p. elegans myotoxic pla <dig> is not anticoagulant, while the two major pla2s of p. flavoviridis venom may be. taken together, it appears that the envenomation strategy of p. flavoviridis is focused much more heavily on provoking hypotension and distributing venom proteins throughout the prey, strategies that makes sense for mammalian prey, with much smaller surface-to-volume ratios than lizards, on which even adult p. elegans feed.table  <dig> the protobothrops elegans and p. flavoviridis transcriptomes are overwhelmingly dominated by pla2s; however, the major pla2s in each are pharmacologically very different. p. flavoviridis venom appears to be much more anti-coagulant, with coagulation factor ix/x-binding proteins, and higher percentages of serine proteases, lao, c-type lectins, 5′-nucleotidase, and phosphodiesterase  <cit>

herein we address the composition of parental and hybrid venoms, confirmation of the hybrid status of the putative hybrids, and how natural selection acts on venoms as integrated systems.

composition of parental and hybrid venoms
phospholipases a2
both protobothrops venom gland transcriptomes were dominated by phospholipases a <dig> . in the protobothrops elegans transcriptome, two pla2s comprised  <dig>  % of all transcripts whereas in p. flavoviridis four isozymes represented  <dig>  % . the pla <dig> content in the p. elegans transcriptome is very high, but reasonable in light of pit viper venom chemistry. for example, in some neotropical rattlesnake  venoms, crotoxin, a heterodimeric, pla <dig> neurotoxin can comprise as much as 88 % of total venom protein .

based on homology to other pla2s of known pharmacology, p. elegans transcript comp43_c0_seq <dig> that constituted  <dig>  % of all transcripts, encodes a noncatalytic, myotoxic pla <dig> myotoxin that shows considerable homology to other asian crotaline myotoxins . in contrast, while p. flavoviridis also has a transcript  for a homologous, non-catalytic, myotoxic pla <dig>  this transcript represents < <dig>  % of the latter transcriptome. both the p. elegans and p. flavoviridis myotoxins have an arginine residue  where catalytic pla2s have aspartic acid in order to bind the ca2+ ion required for catalysis. many new world crotalines have lysine in this position. all three p. elegans specimens and the two hybrids express pe_comp43_c0_seq <dig> heavily, but no snakes in this study produced the p. flavoviridis homolog, pf comp552_c0_seq <dig> .fig.  <dig> 
protobothrops flavoviridis x p. elegans hybrids express phospholipases a <dig> from both parental venoms. a aligned pla <dig> transcripts from p. flavoviridis and p. elegans transcriptomes. the solid heavy vertical line separates the signal peptides from the expressed pla2s. a noncatalytic, myotoxic pla <dig> transcript  from p. elegans specimen # <dig> accounted for  <dig>  % of all p. elegans transcripts . this protein was heavily expressed in all three specimens and in both hybrids . a homologous transcript was found in the transcriptome of p. flavoviridis specimen # <dig>  but it constituted less than  <dig>  % of all p. flavoviridis transcripts . no peptides from this myotoxic pla <dig> transcript were detected in venoms of any p. flavoviridis specimens, or of the hybrids . p. elegans transcript comp47_c0_seq <dig> is homologous to p. flavoviridis transcript comp41_c0_seq <dig> . p. elegans specimens expressed the pla <dig> corresponding to the former transcript, while p. flavoviridis specimens expressed the latter. hybrids expressed both . the p. flavoviridis transcriptome also contained two additional pla <dig> trancripts, comp40_c0_seq <dig> and comp48_c0_seq <dig> . these had no homologs in the p. elegans transcriptome, but hybrids produced both of these, as did all three p. flavoviridis specimens . b peptide coverage of venom pla <dig> transcripts is similar between hybrids and non-hybrid specimens. peptides from p. elegans venoms are indicated by green bars above the sequences, while those from p. flavoviridis venoms are in blue and those of hybrids are in gray. for any given transcript, peptides were sequenced from essentially the same portions of the pla <dig> in both hybrid and non-hybrid venoms

fig.  <dig> proteomic data demonstrate that the two hybrids are genuine. peptides from all specimens were matched to transcripts from both parental species . homologous proteins are aligned on the same row. proteins without homologs in the other transcriptome occupy their own rows. percentages at the bottom of the hybrid columns indicate the percentage of all peptides in the hybrid proteome corresponding to transcripts in each of the parental species. for the hybrids, numbers of unique peptides corresponding to each of the parental transcripts are provided in color-coded columns . if a peptide could have come from one or more transcripts in both parental species, it was classified as “common” , meaning that it was potentially common to both, or that its origin was indeterminate. total percentages of peptides from each protein family are given in bold. hybrid percentages for each pair of venom protein homologs are shown in gray columns. peptides that corresponded to missing portions of incomplete transcripts could not be identified. despite huge advances in mass spectrometric technology, shotgun sequencing is still less quantitative than transcriptomic approaches, so proteomic totals differ quantitatively from those presented for transcriptomes  in the phospholipase a <dig> section,  <dig> peptides from a noncatalytic, myotoxic pla <dig>  were detected in the venom of hybrid  <dig> and  <dig> peptides were isolated in venom of hybrid  <dig>  it was also found in venoms of all three p. elegans specimens. neither the hybrid venoms nor the three p. flavoviridis venoms contained peptides from the homologous pla <dig> . likewise, peptides from two p. flavoviridis pla <dig> transcripts , with no homologs in the p. elegans transcriptome, were found in the venoms of all three p. flavoviridis and those of both hybrids, but not in the three p. elegans venoms. in contrast, p. elegans transcript pe_comp <dig> and p. flavoviridis transcript pf_comp <dig> encode a basic, catalytic pla <dig>  homologous to pl-y. both hybrids had peptides corresponding to each of these transcripts while specimens of the two species had only their own hybrid  <dig> had  <dig> common pla <dig> peptides  and hybrid  <dig> had  <dig>  comprising  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the two hybrid proteomes, respectively. these peptides could have originated with transcripts in both parental venom proteomes and could not be assigned unambiguously to any single transcript. in hybrid  <dig> venom,  <dig>  % of all peptides detected were pla <dig> peptides, while this class accounted for  <dig>  % of the peptides identified in hybrid  <dig> venom. most other protein families tell a similar story. venom composition of the putative hybrid venoms confirm that the specimens are legitimate hybrids



all other pla2s in both venoms are presumably catalytic. the dominant pla2s in p. flavoviridis venom  are both basic, as is p. elegans comp47_c0_seq <dig>  which is homologous to pf comp41_c0_seq <dig>  their pharmacologies are unknown. all three p. elegans venoms contained pe_comp47_c0_seq <dig>  but none of the p. flavoviridis pla2s. likewise, all three p. flavoviridis venoms contained the three pf pla2s, but not pe comp47_c0_seq <dig>  the hybrids, however, produced all five pla2s from both parental species .

protobothrops elegans venom apparently has no neurotoxic pla2s, but p. flavoviridis comp48_c0_seq <dig>  which encodes a weak presynaptic neurotoxin similar to trimucrotoxin  <cit> , comprised  <dig>  % of the p. flavoviridis transcriptome. although some neurotoxic pla2s are also myotoxic  <cit> , myotoxicity appears to be much more important for p. elegans than for p. flavoviridis. nonetheless, it is difficult to offer an ecological explanation for this difference. in general, myotoxicity seems to be most often associated with mammal predation by large terrestrial crotalines , but it has also been reported in small arboreal species  <cit> . without appropriate pharmacological studies in native prey species as well as laboratory animals, it is impossible to know whether such differences are adaptive or ecologically irrelevant. it may be that some subsets of myotoxic pla2s are specifically adapted to reptilian rather than mammalian skeletal muscle, but if so, the structural determinants are currently unknown.

relative to pla2s, one other matter deserves mention. the p. elegans cdna library contains a peculiar transcript, pe_comp103_c0_seq <dig>  that represented  <dig>  % of the transcriptome . using the frame  <dig> reverse translation of comp103_c0_seq <dig>  blastp and tblastx searches both suggested that the best match is a pla <dig> gene cluster from p. flavoviridis   <cit> . however, both sequences are liberally punctuated with stop codons, and the longest, unbroken, translated segment of the p. elegans transcript, using frame  <dig>  encodes only  <dig> amino acids, or about 37 % of a typical type ii pla <dig>  blastp and pfam searches for the 45-residue protein yielded no results. however, mass spectrometry of the eight venoms detected three peptides  that cover  <dig>  % of the putative protein translated in frame  <dig> . further analysis of these peptides was done using de-novo sequencing algorithms and manual annotation, in order to confirm their identity . this protein was not only detected in all three specimens of p. elegans; it was also detected in both hybrid venoms . clearly, the snakes are producing this, but it does not appear to be a pla <dig> derivative, the tblastx searches notwithstanding. its function, assuming that it has one, is unknown.

serine proteases
in both transcriptomes, serine proteases  are the second most abundant protein family . six sps comprise  <dig>  % of all p. elegans transcripts, whereas eight represent  <dig>  % of all p. flavoviridis transcripts. based on homology, p. elegans sp  <dig>  , is a thrombin-like enzyme  and a possible kallikrein. protobothrops elegans sps  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are probable tles, while based on blastp searches, sps  <dig> and  <dig> are probable plasminogen activators. protobothrops flavoviridis sps  <dig> and  <dig> are probably tles, based on sequence homology to dav-pa from deinagkistrodon acutus venom . protobothrops flavoviridis sp <dig>  a complete transcript, is an isoform of a serine protease variously known as habutobin or flavoxobin. it is a strongly anticoagulant thrombin-like enzyme that releases only fibrinopeptide a  <cit> , inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation  <cit> , and releases urokinase-tissue plasminogen activator from bovine arterial endothelial cells  <cit> . in addition, it functions as a c3-convertase that activates the complement cascade  <cit> . sp <dig> most closely resembles kn <dig> from viridovipera stejnegeri venom , for which no pharmacological data are available. sp <dig> is a probable plasminogen activator, based on similarity to another homolog from v. stejnegeri venom  <cit> . the majority of the sps in both venoms appear to function in multiple ways as anticoagulants. as with pla2s, the hybrids produce sps from both parental species, but all peptides could be attributed to specific parental transcripts; there were no peptides of ambiguous  origin.

at first glance, it might appear contradictory for snakes to employ both procoagulant and anticoagulant enzymes, but in reality, this is a well-coordinated strategy to render the prey’s blood wholly incoagulable with astonishing speed. venom thrombin-like enzymes  consume fibrinogen, yielding small fibrin clots, and hypotensive fibrinopeptides  <cit> . however, the commencement of inappropriate clotting triggers the prey’s anti-clotting cascade, which rapidly destroys the fibrin clots  <cit> . protobothrops flavoviridis venom contains a factor ix/x inactivator  that is lacking in p. elegans venom, and kallikrein-like enzymes, which p. elegans does have . but kallikrein converts plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn, digests fibrin. various venom serine proteases have both thrombin-like and kallikrein activities ; thus fibrinogen-clotting and plasminogen activation reside in the same protein. regardless, many crotaline venoms also contain serine and metalloproteases that degrade fibrin directly  <cit> .

many snake venom tles clot fibrinogen less effectively than thrombin  <cit>  and tles are commonly more effective against fibrinogens of some mammal species than others  <cit> , but the existence of so many weakly clotting tles, the capacity of various crotaline tles to degrade prothrombin  <cit> , and the existence of directly fibrinolytic venom enzymes, confirm that the objective is not to clot blood, but to clear the bloodstream of fibrinogen  <cit> . even in human envenomations by small crotalines, blood can be rendered incoagulable within minutes  <cit> . defibrinogenation would occur in small mammalian prey far more rapidly. incoagulable blood presumably facilitates the distribution of venom and endogenous prey tissue hydrolases, promoting prey digestion. in addition to fibrin cleavage, plasmin also inactivates many endogenous clotting factors, thereby acting as an anticoagulant  <cit> ; however, this also suggests that the strategy may be to prevent endogenous coagulation factors from producing properly clotted fibrin. for a more detailed look at the role of serine proteases in envenomation, see the additional file  <dig> 

metalloproteases
in both transcriptomes, p-ii metalloproteases are the third most abundant protein family , followed by p-iii metalloproteases  . protobothrops elegans venom contains as many as six p-ii mps, one apparent p-i mp, and as many as nine p-iii mps. however, caution must be exercised in predicting the number of members of these highly diversified families. from previous experience, it is clear that partial transcripts of large proteins tend to overestimate numbers of homologs and paralogs in these families  <cit> . our earlier study suggested that there could be as many as  <dig> p-ii mps and as many as  <dig> p-iii mps in p. flavoviridis venom. the present study found evidence for no more than  <dig> p-ii mps, but suggested as many as  <dig> p-iii mps . the problem seems to be that the trinity assembler is unable to deal effectively highly diversified families of large proteins, such as mps and sps. reassembly of both transcriptomes using the new assembler, vtbuilder, suggested assembling two pairs of these , resulting in an estimated  <dig> p-iii mps. nonetheless, overall, the two studies present a unified view of the relative importance of the various toxin families.

the putative p-i metalloprotease transcript identified in the p. elegans transcriptome had no apparent homolog in p. flavoviridis. oddly, while peptides from this protein were not identified in any of the p. elegans venom samples, hybrid # <dig> did express it. p-ii metalloproteases were expressed in the hybrids at the slightly lower levels than those seen in either of the parental venoms. four of five p. elegans enzymes were identified in the hybrids and three out of four from p. flavoviridis. in the two parental species, p-ii metalloproteases were expressed somewhat more highly than p-iii enzymes. mps were expressed at about 12–15 % in both hybrids .

it is difficult to predict metalloprotease pharmacology based upon subclass identity alone, owing to a dearth of comparative structure-function studies. the structural complexity of p-iii enzymes in particular, gives rise to a great variety of pharmacologies, including hemorrhage, inflammation, apoptosis, fibrinogen and fibrin degradation, prothrombin activation, and platelet aggregation inhibition  <cit> . the extremely hemorrhagic nature of p. flavoviridis venom is well known , and that characteristic reflects the well-documented presence of hemorrhagic mps . p-iii mps  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are clearly isomers of hr <dig>  a hemorrhagic p-iii mp  . mp p-iiis  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> appear homologous to flavorase , characterized as an apoptosis-inducing protein   <cit> ; however, apoptosis is too slow a process to be relevant to envenomation; its more important contribution to envenomation is probably to degrade fibrinogen  <cit> .

despite the presence of an apparent p-i mp in the p. elegans transcriptome, we are unable to say whether an independent p-i mp exists in this venom, or whether this represents an incomplete p-ii or p-iii transcript. the putative p-i transcript was itself incomplete and represented only  <dig>  % of the transcriptome. moreover, no peptides from this transcript were found in any of the three p. elegans venoms, although they were found in the venom of hybrid # <dig>  graminelysin i, from the venom of trimeresurus gramineus, a p-i mp, has been shown to be processed post-translationally from a p-iii precursor  <cit> , but that situation is probably not analogous to this one.

bradykinin-potentiating peptides and c-type natriuretic peptide
the gene that encodes multiple bradykinin-potentiating peptides and a single c-type natriuretic peptide  was found in both transcriptomes  . all of these gene products are hypotensive, at least in mammals, and cause prey to go into circulatory shock, limiting prey flight  <cit> . these peptides were more highly expressed in p. flavoviridis venoms and peptides from hybrid venoms corresponded only to the p. flavoviridis transcript .

other venom constituents
c-type lectins that act upon blood platelets were found in the transcriptomes and proteomes of both species and hybrid venoms showed peptides from both parental venoms . protobothrops flavoviridis produces an anticoagulant c-type lectin that binds and inactivates coagulation factors ix/ixa and x/xa  <cit> , but p. elegans does not. both hybrids manifested this protein, but at levels substantially lower than seen in p. flavoviridis .

l-amino acid oxidase represented  <dig>  % of the p. flavoviridis transcriptome, but only  <dig>  % in p. elegans . however, lao peptides accounted for  <dig>  % of the p. elegans venom proteome and  <dig>  % in p. flavoviridis . vascular endothelial growth factor, was an even more minor element of the two transcriptomes . all other components represented less than 1 % of one or both transcriptomes . these included phospholipase b, cysteine-rich secretory proteins, 5′-nucleotidase, nerve growth factor, phosphodiesterase, galactose-binding lectin, glutaminyl cyclase, hyaluronidase, dipeptidyl peptidase iv, and aminopeptidase a. pharmacologies of these proteins relative to their roles in envenomation have been reviewed in aird  <cit>  and aird et al.  <cit> .

“common” peptides in the hybrid proteomes
for most protein families, it was possible to detect in the hybrid venoms, a large number of unique peptides that could be assigned to specific transcripts from each of the parental species . however, for some families there were a large number of peptides that could be matched to one or more transcripts in both parental venoms. that is, they were potentially common to both. not surprisingly, the percentage of common peptides in the hybrid proteomes was greatest in the least diversified protein families. these families generally have only one transcript per species. examples include apa , lao , pde , and crisp  . two stark exceptions were 5′-nucleotidase and plb . highly diversified protein families showed much lower percentages of common peptides, the extreme case being serine proteases, for which no common peptides were found.

quantitative proteomics of the hybrids
proteomic data can be quantified by standardizing absolute peptide abundance by the predicted protein length  <cit> . this approach produced significant correlations between protein and transcriptomic abundance estimates, with close agreement between protein sample replicates from different individuals . however, reference transcripts were only available for the parent species, and not for the putative hybrids. in order to make comparisons of protein abundance, a common reference was needed. we identified peptides using each transcriptome as a reference, in order to determine which performed better. the p. flavoviridis reference produced the most significant correlation between transcriptomic and proteomic data for both species , so it was used to call peptides for the hybrids .fig.  <dig> transcriptomic and proteomic data present generally concordant pictures. when mapped against their own references, the proteomic and transcriptomic measures of abundance were correlated . individual proteomic samples are represented by different shapes, with the sample used for the reference transcriptome shown as an open circle. since only one transcriptome was sequenced for each species, biological replicates share the same x-coordinate. the methodology employed herein was that reported in  <cit> 



non-metric, multidimensional scaling analysis of the putative hybrid proteomes showed that they were largely intermediate between those of the parental species . the expression level of homologous venom components was similarly intermediate .fig.  <dig> hybrid snakes have protein expression profiles distinct from those of the parental species. a the non-metric multidimensional scaling  analysis of protein composition and abundance showed that protein levels in the hybrid venom proteomes showed intermediate along the primary mds axis. this analysis shows that the parental species and the hybrids have consistent protein expression levels. b normalized counts of peptides detected by mass spectrometry for homologous proteins in the hybrids, compared to parental values, with y = x line plotted for reference. although most of the hybrid data points lie outside the parental means , suggesting either under- or overdominance, common in hybrids, the overall the slope and the intercept of the best fit are not different from y = x . both analyses show that the hybrid proteomes are on average intermediate relative to those of p. elegans and p. flavoviridis, suggesting strong genetic effects on both their compositions and component levels



confirmation of the putative hybrids
the two putative hybrids expressed all venom proteins from both parental species, except for those corresponding to the most minor transcripts , and had distinct venom profiles . venom proteins produced by only one of the parental species also appeared in hybrid venoms  . they also had roughly intermediate levels of protein expression for most venom proteins, compared to the parental species . the strong correlation between protein levels in the two parental species and in the hybrids indicates that venom levels are genetically controlled . hybrid venom protein levels are largely intermediate between those of the parental species, suggesting that each component may be largely additively regulated, though there is also evidence that hybrids show higher levels of proteins, relative to the two parental species, perhaps a manifestation of “hybrid vigor”. additive effects, as opposed to dominance and epistatic effects, are particularly good targets for natural selection  <cit> , though, more generally, genetic control of venom constituent levels makes them a potential target for natural selection. consequently, rapid population-level changes in venom chemistry are expected in the face of sufficient selective pressure. this mode of regulation is consistent with the rapid evolution of snake venoms seen in protobothrops and other taxa.

given their morphological intermediacy, and the additive compositions of their venoms, it is apparent that the putative hybrids are, in fact, bona fide hybrids. we know of no other way to explain the “hybrid” nature of these venoms except for hybridization between the native p. flavoviridis and the invasive p. elegans.

while the morphologically intermediate animals  are legitimate hybrids, without tissue samples, it is impossible to determine which parent pertained to which species, and we also cannot be certain whether the hybrids are f <dig> or f <dig> hybrids. given the substantial intermediacy of hybrid venom composition relative to the two parental species, it is virtually certain that they do not represent back-crosses with either parental species, which would be expected to skew venom composition toward that parental species. nonetheless, it is clear that p. elegans and p. flavoviridis are not reproductively isolated by pre-mating isolating mechanisms. hybridization with invasive species can threaten conservation of p. flavoviridis, and future studies should address its extent and impact.

venom gland transcripts for which venom peptides were sequenced by mass spectrometry, had much higher rates of non-synonymous to synonymous  substitutions relative to tissue components of the venom gland transcriptomes  . among the proteins detected in either p. elegans or p. flavoviridis venom by mass spectrometry, there was a positive correlation between the average abundance of a toxin in the transcriptome, and its evolutionary rate . including only proteins detected in both venoms, the correlation remained, at lower significance, due to the decreased sample size . protein abundance levels were likewise correlated with evolutionary rate . by contrast, the transcriptional abundance of non-venom  transcripts was negatively correlated with evolutionary rate . there was evidence of positive, significant selection acting on most venom proteins with dn/ds > <dig>  pla2s, metalloproteases and c-type lectins all showed evidence of positive selection in protobothrops as a whole . parris failed to detect positive selection acting on serine proteases , but meme found significant evidence of episodic diversifying selection at four sites, a result consistent with the absence of common peptides .

control of expression levels
differences in abundance of homologous proteins between p. flavoviridis and p. elegans are dramatic. it is possible that the expression level of each venom component is simply a function of its promoter strength. in such a case, we would predict that individual toxin levels should be weakly correlated with levels of other transcripts, and that promoter regions should show classical signs of positive selection, such as reduced haplotypic diversity, and strong sequence divergence between species. both of these predictions can be tested by conducting a gene co-expression level analysis study, and an investigation of genetic diversity upstream of venom toxin genes, respectively.

energetics and selection
although enzymatic venom constituents do not act stoichiometrically as non-catalytic toxins do, nonetheless, greater abundance necessarily signifies a greater role for the constituent in question in prey immobilization and/or digestion, regardless of the presence or absence of catalytic activity. snake venoms are the most concentrated glandular secretions in the animal kingdom, with solutes, 90 % of which are proteins, comprising 25–35 % by mass  <cit> . given the high cost of venom production as a function of overall metabolism  <cit> , more abundant components must necessarily carry a higher biosynthetic cost to the snake. therefore, snakes should optimize the abundance of venom constituents to maximize immobilizing power, while minimizing cost. both venom gene expression levels and gene product sequences should be under strong selective pressure. this seems to be the case generally in protobothrops, at least for sequences above dn/ds =  <dig> , which all showed some evidence of positive selection, in our study and in earlier studies of accelerated evolution, which covered c-type lectins, serine proteases and pla2s  <cit> , and also in our re-analysis . this suggests that the higher rates of evolution in more abundant components are due to adaptation, rather than to relaxed selection.fig.  <dig> secreted proteins evolve rapidly, and more abundant venom toxins evolve most rapidly of all. a violin plot of evolutionary rates of secreted proteins  vs. the rest of the transcriptome. secreted proteins evolve significantly faster than the rest of the transcriptome, suggesting that they are subject to atypically strong selection within the genome. b relationship between abundance and nucleic acid evolutionary rate for secreted proteins. more abundant venom components, which likely represent a greater metabolic investment for the snake, but are also more likely to contribute to the venom’s effectiveness, evolve faster. abbreviations: 5′nt 5′-nucleotidase, ctl c-type lectin, lao l-amino acid oxidase, mp metalloprotease, pde phosphodiesterase, pla phospholipase, sp serine protease, qc glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase. several unlabeled points represent proteins present in the venom at low concentrations, but without clear pharmacological significance



venom proteins and tissue proteins
comparison of two closely related species that became geographically isolated several million years ago  <cit> , allowed us to examine the interplay between venom composition and evolutionary rate of venom proteins. their venoms show much greater sequence divergence than venom gland cellular  components. interestingly, while secreted venom components have evolved much faster than the cellular  portion of the venom gland transcriptome, more abundant venom proteins evolved most rapidly . this pattern contrasted with the cellular portion of the venom gland transcriptome, where there was a negative relationship between protein abundance and evolutionary rate, similar to that found in most organisms  <cit> . together with data including other protobothrops species, which show evidence for positive selection on the most abundant venom components , this strongly argues against the suggestion that snakes inject so much venom into their prey that the resulting ‘overkill’ greatly relaxes selection on venom components  <cit> .

extending the present analysis to other datasets
patterns observed in the two protobothrops species appear to hold generally true for crotaline snakes, based on data from three more species in two additional genera . furthermore, the recently published genome of the king cobra   <cit> , shows the same pattern . these data from four additional studies, employing a range of methodologies, also show that more abundant snake venom proteins evolve faster. it is also possible that other organisms that depend on proteinaceous secretions for parasitism, competition, and defense may exhibit similar patterns, though further work will be necessary to test the generality of this conclusion, evident in snakes.fig.  <dig> data sets from two snake families show that more abundant venom proteins evolve more rapidly. both panels show evolutionary rates, averaged by toxin class, as a function of abundance, using data from five crotaline species in three old and new world genera , and the king cobra genome  . these results mirror the pairwise differences between p. elegans and p. flavoviridis shown in fig.  <dig>  in both cases, average evolutionary rates for the most abundant toxin classes tend to lie above dn/ds >  <dig>  suggesting positive selection. analyses for the two families are presented separately, because they vary greatly in toxin class composition and relative abundance of venom constituents. significance of the associations was computed using spearman’s rank correlation. abbreviations: 3ftx: 3-finger toxins, apa: aminopeptidase a, bpp: bradykinin-potentiating peptide, gbl: galactose-binding lectin, crisp: cysteine-rich secretory proteins, dpp: dipeptidylpeptidase iv, hyal: hyaluronidase, ngf: nerve growth factor, vegf: vascular endothelial growth factor 



CONCLUSIONS
the findings that venom protein concentrations can change dramatically over relatively short periods of time, as in the case of myotoxic pla2s , and that relative concentration affects evolutionary rates of venom constituents, helps us to understand the trade-offs involved in venom formulation. venoms are costly for snakes to produce  <cit> . given that venom components can range in abundance by 3– <dig> orders of magnitude  <cit>  , their cost to the snake likely also varies greatly, with more abundant components being more costly. optimal foraging considerations suggest that snakes should invest in venom constituents in proportion to the benefit each of them provides. therefore, variability in efficacy of the more abundant components will have the greatest fitness consequences for the snake, and those components should experience higher levels of selection. the higher evolutionary rates we observe in more abundant components are the evolutionary signature of this process. this also suggests that changes in venom component levels, rather than protein sequence-level changes, may be the most rapid and effective way for snakes to exploit new prey species.

deposition of data
sequences of genes confirmed by mass spectrometry were curated manually by comparison with data publicly available at ncbi genbank, and deposited in the dna data bank of japan under accession numbers ab984571-ab <dig> for p. elegans and ab985221-ab <dig> for p. flavoviridis.
