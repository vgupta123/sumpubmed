BACKGROUND
parasitic nematodes have complex life-cycles that are affected and controlled by factors both within and outwith their hosts. in the genus strongyloides, the life-cycle, unusually, includes both an obligate female-only parasitic generation and a facultative dioecious adult free-living generation. in recent years there has been an increasingly detailed understanding of the factors that affect the development of the free-living phase of this life-cycle, particularly for the parasites of rats, s. ratti  <cit> .

s. ratti parasitic females lie embedded in the mucosa of the small intestine of their host. these females reproduce by mitotic parthenogenesis and lay eggs that pass with the host faeces into the environment, where the development of the free-living stages occurs  <cit> . direct development occurs when genetically female first-stage larvae  moult twice to develop into infective third stage larvae  which can infect new hosts by skin penetration. in indirect development, both genetically male and female l1s moult four times into adult free-living males and females, respectively. these free-living adults undergo sexual reproduction, the female lays eggs that then  develop into il3s   <cit> .

the control of the developmental fates of the larvae of the free-living generation occurs by the action of a male/female genetic sex determination event  <cit>  and a subsequent female-only developmental choice. in this female-only choice, genetically female larvae can develop directly into il3s or develop indirectly into free-living adult females. analysis of the proportion of larvae that develop by these two developmental routes shows that as an s. ratti infection progresses two changes occur. firstly, the proportion of larvae that develop into free-living males increases, i.e. the sex ratio becomes more male biased. secondly, that the proportion of female larvae that develop indirectly into free-living females is favoured, i.e. the female-only developmental choice becomes more biased towards the development of adult free-living females  <cit> . that these two changes occur as an infection progresses in immunologically normal rats, but that these do not occur in immunodeficient rats, suggests that this is controlled by the host's anti-strongyloides immune response. the temperature, external to the host, at which larvae develop also affects the female-only developmental choice, with indirect development of female larvae favoured at greater temperatures. the effects of the host immune response and of temperature external to the host interact, such that the temperature sensitivity of developing female larvae is greater in larvae passed from hosts that have an anti-s. ratti immune response  <cit> . in addition to these significant effects of within- and outwith-host environmental conditions and their interaction, there is a strong s. ratti genetic component. this genetic effect is seen both as different developmental propensities of different isofemale lines and as the response of isofemale lines to selection for different developments  <cit> . the genus parastrongyloides is the closest relative to strongyloides  <cit> . in the most thoroughly investigated species, p. trichosuri, there is a facultative dioecious free-living adult generation, similar to that of strongyloides; however, the parasitic generation is also dioecious, unlike strongyloides  <cit> .

for many species of parasitic nematodes, including strongyloides, the infective stage is a third larval stage . many analogies have been drawn between il3s of parasitic nematodes and the dauer larvae of free-living nematodes such as c. elegans  <cit> . dauer larvae of c. elegans are long-lived arrested stages formed under conditions of high con-specific population density and low food availability  <cit> . the particular similarities of il3s of parasitic nematodes and of dauer larvae of c. elegans and other free-living nematodes are that they are both third larval stages, they are arrested in their development, and they are non-feeding, environmentally resistant stages with specialised morphology. both il3s and dauer larvae persist in the environment until specific cues signal the resumption of development; for parasitic nematodes this is the infection of a new host, for c. elegans this is the availability of food. the transcription rates in c. elegans dauer larvae are approximately six-to-seven fold lower compared with actively growing non-dauer stages  <cit> . more recently, sage and microarray analysis have identified the expression of dauer-specific or -enriched genes, including genes that appear to only be transcribed upon exit from the dauer stage. this suggests that dauer larvae are more transcriptionally active than hitherto thought  <cit> .

the existence of dauer larvae suggests the possibility that they are at least part of the means by which the parasitic nematode lifestyle evolved from a free-living one. for c. elegans, the genetic and molecular genetic control of the commitment to develop as dauer larvae is well characterised and includes a tgf-β-like pathway, an insulin-like pathway and a guanyl cyclase pathway  <cit> . comparisons of s. stercoralis  l1- and il3-specific or -biased genes with c. elegans dauer or non-dauer-specific or -biased genes showed greater significant alignment of the s. stercoralis l <dig> and c. elegans non-dauer genes  than expected by chance  <cit> . these results suggest that there is some transcriptional conservation of genes involved in early larval growth, but that there is no such conservation between dauer larvae of c. elegans and il3s of s. stercoralis; this, therefore, does not obviously support the hypothesised evolutionary link between il3s of parasitic nematodes and dauer larvae of free-living nematodes. for some parasitic nematodes, genes putatively homologous to the tgf-β-like genes involved in the initiation of c. elegans dauer larva development have been identified and their life-cycle expression profiles determined  <cit> . for four species of parasitic nematodes, this has shown that these apparently homologous genes have a similar  expression pattern through their respective life-cycles, but one that is different to that of c. elegans. these results may, therefore, suggest that this gene has evolved a parasitism-specific role or function  <cit> . this is an example of the particular challenge of beginning to understand how the role and function of genes has both been maintained and changed during the evolution of parasitism  <cit> .

in recent years there have been extensive est-based gene discovery programmes for parasitic nematodes. to date, some  <dig> genera of parasitic nematodes, including s. ratti and s. stercoralis, have been analysed which has generated c.  <dig>  ests  <cit> . an analysis of these data from  <dig> species of nematodes  has shown that there are significant differences between different nematode species and groups. for example, more than half the predicted genes from nematodes appear to be unique to the phylum and 23% of the predicted genes are unique to the species from which they were found  <cit> .

the enormous quantity of data available for parasitic nematodes now needs to be used to understand the biology of these important pathogens and to use such understanding and the genomic data directly, to identify chemotherapeutic and vaccination targets. this genomic-scale work is now beginning to be able to complement the extensive genetic, genomic and post-genomic analyses of the model free-living nematodes c. elegans and c. briggsae  <cit> . for these species, there is now a very good understanding of many aspects of its development and life, which in contrast to the situation with many, if not most, parasitic nematodes.

in the est analysis of s. ratti,  <dig>  ests  were obtained from five cdna libraries encompassing the free-living  and parasitic female  stages of the life-cycle . bioinformatic analyses reduced these ests into  <dig>  contig sequences where each contig contains multiple ests that represent apparently identical and, or overlapping transcripts. these contigs were further grouped into  <dig>  clusters, which are likely to contain splice-variants, highly similar gene-family members, alleles and polymorphisms. assuming that s. ratti has approximately  <dig>  genes   <cit> , then these clusters represent approximately 20% of s. ratti's genes. comparison of these clusters to all available sequences showed that 25%  of clusters had no significant alignments and therefore may represent genes newly discovered in s. ratti and, or s. ratti-specific genes, or 5' and 3' untranslated regions that are known to show very little homology between species  <cit> ; the remaining 75% had significant alignments to proteins from c. elegans, other nematodes or non-nematodes. analysis of the representation of the ests, by their cluster, in the different cdna libraries was used as a measure of gene expression. of the  <dig>  clusters,  <dig>  contain more than one est; analysis of the distribution of the ests of these clusters between the four different life-cycle stages available, showed that 44% of clusters  are expressed in more than one life-cycle stage. analysis of genes expressed at high levels  and a comparison of the occurrence of these between the free-living and parasitic stages shows that  <dig> clusters account for 38% of all expression and that  <dig> of these clusters have significantly different levels of expression between the free-living and parasitic stages of the life-cycle  <cit> .

studies of gene expression during the life cycle of several parasitic nematodes have recently been undertaken. for brugia malayi, an oligonucleotide array representing  <dig>  clusters generated from ests sequenced from  <dig> cdna libraries that represent the major b. malayi life cycle stages  <cit>  was probed using cdna from adult males and females. this study identified  <dig>  clusters that showed sex-dependent expression. similarly, for trichostrongylus vitrinus,  <dig>  genes with sex-dependent expression were identified by microarray analysis  <cit> . for ascaris suum, a dna array of  <dig>  ests was analysed to identify genes that had co-ordinated changes in expression during the within-host l <dig> stage  <cit> . in contrast to this work with parasitic nematodes, extensive microarray and sage analysis has been carried out with c. elegans, particularly comparing gene expression in different life-cycle stages  <cit> .

here we report the construction of a dna microarray of available s. ratti ests, which we have used to begin to explore changes in gene expression in different aspects of the development of the free-living stages of the s. ratti life-cycle . the broader rationale of this work was to begin to investigate and understand the role of these recently discovered genes in the life of s. ratti, which for the vast majority are, so far, totally unexplored. in this work we have, specifically, compared gene expression between  free-living l1s and il3s and  free-living l2s destined to develop directly into il3s and l2s destined to develop indirectly into free-living adults   <cit> . a priori, the l <dig> v il <dig> comparison is seeking substantial differences between morphologically and biologically distinct life-cycle stages; the l <dig> direct v l <dig> indirect comparison is seeking small differences, i.e. between larvae with different future development. for this latter comparison, we hypothesised that by discovering genes whose expression was significantly altered at the beginning of these different routes of development, that this may identify key processes and pathways that control direct and indirect development of s. ratti. for the comparison of gene expression in l <dig> and il <dig> stages, we hypothesised that this would identify genes central to larval growth  and genes involved in the induction and maintenance of the arrested state of il3s . this latter group of genes also allows a comparison of the transcriptome of c. elegans dauer larvae and of s. ratti il3s. furthermore, the s. ratti l <dig> v il <dig> comparison of gene expression is also analogous to the est representation-based analyses of gene expression of these stages in s. stercoralis  <cit> .overall, these studies also allowed an extensive series of experiments, validating this microarray approach with s. ratti and exploring the genetic basis of the development of the free-living generation.

RESULTS
l <dig> v il3
gene expression was compared in l <dig> passed in faeces and in il3s . the microarray used consisted of some  <dig>  individual clones which are represented by  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  clusters. the resulting microarray expression data are analysed at these three levels to quality control the data generated and to investigate and compare gene expression in these different life-cycles stages.

l <dig> v il3: data quality assurance
 <dig> microarray slides  were probed using four different biological replicates,  <dig> of these slides passed our quality controls and went forward for analysis. across all the biological and technical replicates data were available for  <dig>  of the  <dig>  arrayed features.  <dig>  ests were identified whose expression was significantly different between the l <dig> and il <dig> stages . this number is greater than the  <dig> significant results that would be expected by chance . of these  <dig> , the expression of  <dig>  was significantly greater in the il <dig> stage and  <dig> significantly greater in the l <dig> stage, of which  <dig> and  <dig> ests were expressed two or more-fold greater in the il <dig> and l <dig> stages, respectively . the hybridization of control 'spikes' 3- and 10-fold different between samples resulted in mean observed differences in expression of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these measurements suggest that the dynamic range over which the observed experimental data fall is broadly correct though, somewhat constrained compared with the actual differences in observed expression.

we wished to assess the reproducibility of expression data between individual arrayed ests within their respective contigs and clusters. to do this, for each of these  <dig>  ests that were significantly differentially expressed, we also analysed the expression data for other contig and cluster members  present on this microarray to which these  <dig>  ests belonged. the  <dig>  ests belonged to  <dig> contigs and  <dig> clusters;  <dig> ests were single-est contigs and clusters. for the  <dig>   non-single est contigs and clusters we determined the proportion of ests belonging to each contig and cluster which  produced hybridization data that passed the quality control threshold and  the proportion of these that were also significantly different between the l <dig> and il <dig> stages. these measures are an assessment of the reproducibility of the expression ratio data between contig and cluster members. a mean of  <dig> % and  <dig> % of ests of these contigs and clusters, respectively, produced hybridization data that passed the quality control threshold; a mean of  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the ests of these contigs and clusters, respectively, were significantly  differently expressed between the l <dig> and il <dig> stages. this generally high level of concordance of the measured expression of individual ests suggests that data arising from individual arrayed ests can be used as criteria for selecting contigs and clusters for further analysis. similarly, the generally high level of congruence of detection of significantly different expression, also suggests that robust measurement of differential gene expression is possible with these microarrays. individual arrayed est members of individual contigs and clusters are diverse with respect to the length of sequence arrayed which is likely to contribute substantially to inter-est variation in observed expression.

to further investigate the relationship of measures of expression for contigs and their respective clusters, we identified contigs whose ratio of expression  was greater than or equal to two. this resulted in  <dig> contigs whose expression was 'up' in this manner in the l <dig> stage and  <dig> contigs 'up' in the il <dig> stage . these  <dig> contigs represent  <dig> clusters,  <dig> of which  are multi-contig clusters. we interrogated the microarray expression data for the other contigs of these multi-contig clusters. this analysis showed that within  <dig> clusters, more than one component contig produced microarray hybridization data above the quality threshold ,  <dig> did not. overall, these  <dig> multi-contig clusters consisted of a total of  <dig> contigs, of which the ratio of the expression between the l <dig> and il <dig> stages of  <dig> contigs  was directionally concordant within a cluster; only 4% were directionally discordant. the remaining 35% of contigs showed directionally concordant expression, though the difference between the l <dig> and il <dig> stages was not statistically significantly different. this further suggests both that the gene expression measured by these microarrays is a robust measurement of actual gene expression and that both the computationally created contigs and clusters  <cit>  are accurate representations of actual units of expression .

our previous analysis of the s. ratti ests considered large clusters, i.e. clusters containing the greatest number of ests across all s. ratti life-cycle stages  <cit> . analysis of the representation of ests between the different cdna libraries suggested that  <dig> of the  <dig> biggest clusters were expressed in free-living stages  <cit> . these  <dig> clusters are represented by  <dig>  ests, which is 26% of the total  <dig>  ests present on this microarray. we were concerned that highly represented contigs and clusters may be identified as significantly different between the l <dig> and il <dig> stages through purely stochastic events relating to the size of these contigs and clusters. we investigated this by analysis of all ests belonging to these top  <dig> clusters  <cit> . this showed that for the  <dig> largest clusters on this microarray a mean of  <dig> % of the ests from these clusters, that were present on the microarray, produced hybridization data above the quality threshold, of which  <dig> % were significantly different between the l <dig> and il <dig> stages. for all of the remaining clusters  for which there were data across all the biological and technical replicates , a mean of  <dig> % of the ests of each cluster produced hybridization data above the quality threshold of which  <dig> % were significantly different between the l <dig> and il <dig> stage. this high degree of similarity between the hybridization behaviour of ests of large clusters and all the est data, shows that ests of large clusters do not behave any differently. these results therefore suggest that high representation of a cluster does not, of itself, result in the generation of significant results from this microarray. of these  <dig> largest s. ratti clusters  <cit> , the microarray expression data showed that four were significantly differently expressed between l <dig> and il <dig> stages with a two-fold or greater difference: l1-up sr <dig>  <dig> -fold, sr <dig>  <dig> -fold, sr <dig>  <dig> -fold; il3-up sr <dig>  <dig> -fold.

previously, putative stage  specific gene-expression had been determined based on the representation of ests among cdna libraries  <cit> . we wished to determine whether this was supported, or not, by the microarray data. to do this we investigated the concordance of the l <dig> v il <dig> microarray results with the occurrence of ests in the l <dig> or mixed il3/free-living adult library  <cit> . specifically, from the microarray results, for the  <dig> contigs significantly differently expressed between the l <dig> and il <dig> stages  we determined from the observed cdna library representation, the proportion of contigs for which this was  concordant ;  discordant  or  equal. combining the results for the l1- and il3-up contigs showed that there was  <dig> % discordance,  <dig> % concordance and 31% equality. this high level of discordance suggests that the use of representation of ests in different cdna libraries may not be a good measure of differences in expression between different life-cycle stages or between different samples.

we used reverse transcriptase-pcr  to confirm the microarray expression data for a selection of genes with a range of l <dig> : il <dig> differences in expression. the mean rt-pcr expression ratios of the  <dig> l1- or il3-up contigs together with their microarray mean cluster and contig expression ratios are shown in table  <dig>  this shows that for  <dig> of the  <dig>  these contigs, the rt-pcr data were directionally concordant with the microarray data. further, for  <dig> of these  <dig> contigs  the difference in gene expression measured by rt-pcr was greater than that measured by the microarrays. a corollary of this is that the reported levels of difference in gene expression determined from the microarrays  may be conservative. these data also make clear that microarray expression data should always be further investigated by rt-pcr analyses.

we investigated the relationship between the observed microarray hybridization intensity of clusters and the number of ests contained within the respective cluster. the rationale for this analysis, was that the number of ests within a cluster is commonly used as a measure of the level of gene expression; for this to be correct a positive relationship with microarray hybridization intensity should be observed. in this analysis, we treated clusters containing large numbers of ests in two ways such that clusters containing more than  <dig> ests were grouped into  three categories; 11– <dig>  26– <dig>  >  <dig> or  one category; >  <dig>  ests per cluster. overall, there is a positive relationship between the number of ests within a cluster and the observed mean cluster hybridization intensity, but that this relationship breaks down for clusters that contain more than c.  <dig> ests . there are two, non-mutually exclusive reasons for this lack of correlation for very large clusters. firstly, the large representation of the clusters on the microarray itself may have affected the hybridization kinetics of members of these large clusters. secondly, the high est representation of these clusters may be a quantitatively incorrect representation of the relative abundance of the mrna abundance in the sample from which the cdna library was constructed. thus, a bias in the cloning and, or sequencing etc. of certain gene transcripts may have, at least in part, generated the high est representation. if this latter scenario is correct, then caution should be exercised, and independent evidence generated, when using est representation as a measure of high levels of gene expression.

overall these analyses of gene expression of l <dig> and il3s on these s. ratti microarrays show that robust data can be generated. a particular feature of this microarray is that component ests of many contigs and clusters provide replicate data  for measurement of gene expression. here we have presented data that shows a high level of concordance of measurement of gene expression between cluster and contig members. we also show that the very large representation of some clusters and contigs on the microarray does not bias observed results. the observed microarray results are, in general, confirmed by rt-pcr analysis. comparison of measures of differences in gene expression between these two stages as determined from this s. ratti microarray and from analysis of est representation in cdna libraries  <cit>  has shown a low concordance.

direct l <dig> v indirect l2
gene expression was compared in free-living second stage larvae  destined to develop directly into il <dig> stages and in l2s destined to develop indirectly into free-living adults .

direct l <dig> v indirect l2: data quality assurance
 <dig> slides were probed  using four different biological replicates, of these  <dig> slides passed our quality control and went forward for analysis. across all the biological and technical replicates, data were available for  <dig>  of the  <dig>  arrayed spots.  <dig> ests were identified whose expression was significantly different between the direct l <dig> and the indirect l <dig> stages . this number is greater than the  <dig> significant results that would be expected by chance . of these  <dig>  the expression of  <dig> was significantly greater in the indirectly developing l2s and  <dig> significantly greater in the directly developing l2s, of which four and one ests were expressed two or more-fold greater in the indirect l <dig> and direct l <dig> stages, respectively . the hybridization of control 'spikes' 3- and 10-fold different between samples resulted in mean observed differences in expression of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. as for the l <dig> and il <dig> data, this suggests that the dynamic range over which the observed experimental l <dig> microarray data fall is generally correct, though somewhat constrained compared with the actual differences in observed expression.

to asses the reproducibility of expression data between individual arrayed ests within their respective contigs and clusters, for each of these  <dig> ests that were significantly differentially expressed, we also analysed the expression data for other contig and cluster members  present on this microarray to which these  <dig> ests belonged. the  <dig> ests belonged to  <dig> contigs and  <dig> clusters;  <dig> ests were single-est contigs and clusters. for the  <dig>  non-single est clusters and contigs we determined the proportion of ests belonging to each contig and cluster which  produced hybridization data that passed the quality control threshold and  the proportion of these that were also significantly different between the direct and indirect stages. a mean of  <dig> % and  <dig> % of ests of these contigs and clusters, respectively, produced hybridization data that passed the quality control threshold; a mean of  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the ests of these contigs and clusters, respectively, were significantly  differently expressed between the direct and indirect stages. this observed level of concordance for the contigs is similar to the l <dig> and il <dig> data, but lower for the analysis by cluster. one possibility for this difference is that, compared with the l <dig> and il <dig> data, the clusters used in this analysis of gene expression in l2s, may less accurately represent actual units of expression in the l <dig> stages. this possibility would need to be investigated directly.

to further investigate the relationship of measures of expression for contigs and their respective clusters, we identified contigs that had the greatest difference in their ratio of expression  between the l <dig> direct and indirect stages, with a two or more-fold difference in expression. this analysis resulted in just two contigs whose expression was 'up' in this manner in the indirectly developing l <dig> and one in the directly developing l2s ; these three contigs represent three clusters.

of the previously identified large est clusters  <cit> ,  <dig> occurred in the l <dig> stages. from these microarray data,  <dig> % of the ests of these  <dig> clusters produced hybridization data above the quality threshold, of which 8% were significantly different between the two l <dig> stages. for the remaining  <dig>  ests not within these clusters,  <dig> % produced hybridization data above the quality threshold, of which  <dig> % were significantly different between the two l <dig> stages. therefore, as for the l <dig> and il <dig> data, the hybridization behaviour of ests of highly represented clusters and all other ests, appears to be the same.

we used rt-pcr to confirm the microarray expression data. the mean rt-pcr expression ratios of the  <dig> l <dig> direct- or l <dig> indirect-up contigs together with their microarray mean contig expression ratios are shown in table  <dig>  this shows that for  <dig> of these  <dig>  contigs, the rt-pcr data were directionally concordant with the microarray data. further, for  <dig> of these  <dig>  contigs, the difference in gene expression between the samples measured by the rt-pcr was greater than that measured by the microarrays. a corollary of this is that the reported levels of difference in gene expression determined from the microarrays  may be conservative.

as for the l <dig> and il <dig> data  we investigated the relationship between the observed microarray hybridization intensity of clusters and the number of ests contained within the respective cluster. this again showed a positive relationship, but one that breaks down for clusters that contain more than c.  <dig> ests .

the microarray analysis of gene expression in l <dig> stages results in data with similar characteristics to those generated from analysis of the l <dig> and il <dig> stages.

l <dig> v il3: biological results and interpretation
the  <dig>  significantly differently expressed ests, represent  <dig> contigs and  <dig> clusters  that were expressed at a significantly higher level in the il <dig> stage. in the l <dig> stage,  <dig> contigs and  <dig> clusters  were expressed at significantly higher levels .

blast analysis of the  <dig> clusters with a greater than two-fold difference in expression in the il <dig> stage, compared with the l <dig> stage, shows that nine have no significant alignment,  <dig> have a significant alignment to known c. elegans proteins and  <dig> have a significant alignment to hypothetical proteins from c. elegans. nine have significant alignments to other parasitic nematode ests, one aligns to an onchocerca volvulus far protein and one aligns to a hypothetical protein from a mouse. overall the maximum and mean difference in expression was  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold, respectively. further details of these data are shown in table  <dig> 

blast analysis of the  <dig> clusters with a greater than two-fold difference in expression in the l <dig> stage, compared with the il <dig> stage, shows that three have no significant alignment; seven have a significant alignment to hypothetical proteins from c. elegans and the remaining  <dig> have significant alignment to known c. elegans proteins . overall the maximum and mean difference in expression was  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold, respectively.

we used gene ontology  slim analysis of a representative sequence from each cluster  <cit>  to further understand the difference in the l <dig> and il <dig> transcription profile. of the  <dig> l1-up  clusters  approximately half the clusters could not be assigned to a process, function or component , but the largest remaining categories were consistent with larval growth. thus, by go process, of the 62% that had an assignment, 61% were classified as being involved with protein biosynthesis and metabolism, 26% with embryogenesis; by go function, of the 35% that had an assignment, 69% were classified as being a ribosomal component; by go component, of the 57% that had an assignment, 76% were classified as being a component of the ribosome.

a similar pattern is also seen by blast analysis of a representative contig consensus sequence from each cluster . among these  <dig> l1-up clusters, 60% have significant alignment to ribosomal or ribosomal-associated proteins and  <dig> % align to other proteins known to have housekeeping functions or functions required for larval growth . in addition, 19% align to hypothetical proteins and  <dig> % have no significant alignment. this view of gene expression in the l <dig> stage is consistent with these stages undertaking substantial protein synthesis, consistent with growth of these stages as l1s and in preparation for development to the l <dig> stage .

the picture for il <dig> stages is less clear. go slim analysis of the  <dig> il3-up  clusters  showed that most clusters  could not be assigned to a process, function or component. the remainder of the classifications belonged to a diversity of processes, functions or components with no clear, unifying theme. blast analysis of these  <dig> clusters, using a representative contig consensus sequence, showed that  <dig> % have no significant alignment, 29% align to hypothetical proteins and  <dig> % align to other nematode ests; there are various other alignments  to known c. elegans proteins but, again, with no unifying theme; there are no alignments to ribosomal proteins. overall, this shows that the gene expression of the il <dig> stage is very different to that of the l <dig> stage. this result is, therefore, consistent with the il <dig> stage not growing, as is obvious from observation of its biology. the high proportion of il3-up genes with significant alignment to hypothetical proteins, or to uncharacterised ests, or with no significant alignment at all, suggests that the transcriptional profile of these infective stages involves genes whose role and function remain to be elucidated in nematodes  and other organisms. more broadly this suggests that genes involved in the biology of the infective stage of s. ratti, and perhaps other parasitic nematodes, remains to be investigated. these infective stages are a crucial step in the transmission of parasitic nematodes. it can be envisaged that approaches to the control of parasitic nematodes could be targeted against such infective stages. discovering genes crucial to the biology of infective larvae could be important in this respect.

we investigated the relationship of the s. ratti genes whose expression was different between l <dig> and il <dig> stages, to genes of c. elegans. in c. elegans, genes have been identified that when knocked-down by rna interference  result in defects in growth, larval arrest, morphology, movement or reproduction  <cit> . for each of the  <dig> l1-up and  <dig>  il3-up ests  we identified a c. elegans gene with these rnai phenotypes. this was done by matching the most significant blast alignment  of the  <dig>  s. ratti ests to the c. elegans genes with these rnai phenotypes. overall,  <dig>  of these s. ratti ests had such alignments;  <dig> did not. we then calculated the mean l <dig> : il <dig> fold difference in expression of these s. ratti ests that  had a significant blast alignment and  did not have a significant blast alignment with the c. elegans genes, and compared these using a t-test . this shows that there is a significant difference in the expression of these s. ratti ests between l <dig> and il <dig> stages for each of the c. elegans rnai phenotypic classes, with greater average expression in l <dig> stages compared with il3s . thus, s. ratti genes whose expression is, on average, greater in l1s than in il3s are more likely to have an alignment to c. elegans genes which themselves have, at least one, of these rnai phenotypes. there are two, mutually non-exclusive reasons for this observation. firstly, the role of these s. ratti l1-up genes may be more central to core aspects of nematode biology, such that they are, comparatively, over represented in the c. elegans rnai phenotypic classes. secondly, the c. elegans rnai analysis may have under-reported genes with phenotypes present in, or relevant to, dauer larvae . this second possibility further suggests that the genetic basis of the biology of infective l3s of s. ratti and other parasitic nematodes is under explored.

analogously lists of genes identified by sage as being differentially expressed in c. elegans dauer larvae compared with non-dauer, mixed life-cycle stages were obtained  <cit>  and compared  with the s. ratti l1-up and il3s-up ests. this analysis identified  <dig> matches between the s. ratti ests and the c. elegans gene lists. for each of these  <dig> genes and ests, the c. elegans dauer/non-dauer ratio was plotted against the s. ratti l <dig> : il <dig> ratio. no correlation was observed , which suggests that there is little identifiable transcriptional conservation in these life-cycle stages between s. ratti and c. elegans. similarly, for genes matched between s. ratti and c. elegans there was no correlation between the s. ratti mean intensity of expression and the c. elegans sage measures of intensity of expression .

we also investigated the relationship of l <dig> and il <dig> gene expression in s. ratti and s. stercoralis. for s. stercoralis, contigs have been identified  whose expression is potentially l1- or il3- specific or -biased . specifically,  <dig> and  <dig> contigs were identified as being l1- and il3-biased, respectively and  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs as being l1- and il3-specific, respectively in s. stercoralis. to compare these putatively differently expressed s. stercoralis contigs with the expression of s. ratti contigs, measured by microarray analysis, we identified matching s. ratti and s. stercoralis contigs by local blast alignment of representative s. stercoralis contig consensus sequences to s. ratti representative contig consensus sequences. all  <dig> s. ratti contigs  had a significant s. stercoralis alignment. we then determined the mean l <dig> : il <dig> expression ratio of these s. ratti contigs that had such matches to the s. stercoralis contigs in each of the four categories of s. stercoralis expression and those that did not, and compared these using a t-test . this analysis shows that the s. ratti alignments of s. stercoralis l1-biased contigs were significantly differently expressed in s. ratti, but with greater expression in il <dig> stages, compared with l1s. there are further significant differences in the expression of s. ratti genes with respect to the s. stercoralis contigs though this difference is in the magnitude of the difference in expression in il3s rather than between il3s and l1s . in all, these results suggest that there is little conservation of l1- and il <dig> biased and -specific gene expression of s. ratti  and of s. stercoralis .

the different methods used to measure gene expression in s. ratti, s. stercoralis and c. elegans may be a source of significant differences in the observed transcriptional profile. in other systems, comparison of sage and microarray  <cit>  and est representation and microarray  <cit>  data have shown rather limited concordance; comparison of six different microarray platforms found substantial similarity in the observed expression  <cit> . for the parasitic nematode haemonchus contortus, comparison between sage and two est libraries showed some, though not extensive, similarity in expression for specific genes, though when analysed by functional classes, rather greater similarity was apparent  <cit> . during the construction of cdna libraries, biases in the representation of cdna species can occur due to several factors that affect the cdna synthesis at various steps. for example the at content of the starting material or the secondary structure of the different rna molecules can inhibit the function of reverse transcriptase. large transcripts are often prematurely truncated due to the inefficiencies of reverse transcriptase and size fractionation methods for cdna purification can exclude some transcripts. in some cases, following cloning, inserts are lost due to vector-driven expression of deleterious genes, vector instability following insert driven transcription and finally inappropriate antibiotic resistance. furthermore, it is unusual for technical and biological repeats to be used in construction of such libraries which has the consequence that any est representation analysis is based on a statistical sample size of one. this is in contrast to sage and microarray analyses which have replicate measures, so as to facilitate rigorous statistical analyses  <cit> .

comparison of gene expression between l <dig> and il <dig> stages has shown that there are extensive differences. genes with significantly greater expression in l <dig> are largely concerned with growth. the identity and likely role of those with significantly greater expression in il3s are unknown. there is little evidence of observed commonality of transcription between l <dig> and il3s of s. ratti and s. stercoralis, nor between s. ratti and c. elegans dauer larvae.

l <dig> direct v l <dig> indirect: biological results and interpretation
the  <dig> significantly differently expressed ests, represent  <dig> contigs and  <dig> clusters  that were expressed at a significantly higher level in the directly developing l2s. for indirectly developing l2s,  <dig> contigs and  <dig> clusters  were expressed at significantly higher levels . blast analysis of these clusters whose expression was two or more-fold greater is shown in table  <dig>  the cluster from the l2-direct stage has a significant alignment to a c. elegans hypothetical protein, and the two clusters from the l2-indirect stage have significant alignments to a c. elegans probable peroxiredoxin and a schistosoma mansoni orf. there were no gene ontology  slim designations for these clusters.

in the l <dig> indirect-up category,  <dig> %  of contigs align to hypothetical and unknown genes whereas in the l <dig> direct-up contigs there are  <dig> % . the l <dig> library contains  <dig> %  contigs that align to unknown genes  <cit> . thus, genes whose expression is comparatively greater in directly developing l2s are less likely to be previously uncharacterised genes, compared with all l <dig> ests and compared with those genes with significantly greater expression in the directly developing l2s. directly developing l2s develop into il3s and there is therefore a contrast between the two analyses undertaken here. comparative analysis of l <dig> and il <dig> gene expression , suggests that gene expression in il3s is of, comparatively, unknown genes, whereas this analysis  suggests a contrary situation for the preceding l <dig> stage.

analysis of gene expression in l <dig> stages with different developmental fates only reveals small, but significant, differences in gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
this first study of multi-gene expression in the parasitic nematode s. ratti using a microarray of ests has shown that robust data can be generated; that measures of expression derived from within multi-est contigs and clusters are consistent and that there are unlikely to be any biases in observed results due to est-dense clusters. the observed microarray expression data support overall the computationally determined clusters and contigs as units of expression. comparison of est representation and microarray data show substantial inconsistencies in identification of  highly abundant expressed genes and  life-cycle stage-specific or -biased expression. the observed microarray results are, in general, supported by gene specific rt-pcr data. we find little evidence for the conservation of transcriptional profiles between s. ratti  and s. stercoralis ; nor between s. ratti and c. elegans. part of this difference is likely to be due to the different approaches used in the measurement of gene expression. this difference is likely to be exacerbated by the observation of the substantial inter-specific differences in the discovered expressed genes  <cit> .

within the s. ratti life-cycle we find that the biologically distinct l <dig> and il <dig> stages are similarly transcriptionally distinct. the predominant role of genes more highly expressed in l <dig> stages is involvement with protein synthesis and thus growth, commensurate with their observed biology. genes more highly expressed in il <dig> stages are, comparatively, less easy to assign a role or function to them. more generally, it is significant that many of the genes whose expression is significantly different between l <dig> and il <dig> stages are unknown beyond alignments to proteins predicted from the c. elegans genome sequence. this highlights the substantial experimental challenge that lies ahead in actually determining the role and function of these genes in the s. ratti lifecycle. the analysis of l <dig> and il <dig> gene expression has, though, identified genes likely to be specifically important in the biology of these stages, which can therefore direct future effort at discovering the role and function of these genes. the transcriptional profiles of l <dig> stages with different  future development are very similar, though not identical.
