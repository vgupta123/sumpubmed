BACKGROUND
microorganisms inhabit various sites of the human body  <cit> . the largest number of microorganisms is found in the gut  <cit> . the gut microbiome is associated with human health  <cit> . for example, the gastrointestinal microbiome affects human physiological functions such as immune function and inflammation suppression, food decomposition and nutrient absorption, regulation of blood substrate via the nervous and/or endocrine system, and recovery rate from bacterial infection  <cit> . however, some of the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. enterotypes of the human gut microbiome are not associated with gender, age, or body weight but are influenced by long-term dietary habits. therefore, we aimed to identify the enterotypes of adults in taiwan by next-generation sequencing .

since the human microbiome project  was launched by the national institutes of health in  <dig>  ngs has been widely used to study the human microbiome  <cit> . one of the benefits of ngs is that it is a culture-independent method that can be used to characterize microbial community profiles by sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna . in addition, hundreds to thousands of bacteria can be identified at a time on sequencing 16s rdna by ngs. thus, variations in bacteria among different samples can be determined by comparing their quantitative profiles  <cit> .

in  <dig>  three enterotypes of the human gut microbiome were identified from  <dig> human fecal samples from european individuals. the major bacteria in these enterotypes were bacteroides, prevotella, and ruminococcus  <cit> . this finding was subsequently validated by another approach using the same hmp dataset  <cit> . however, after identifying the long-term dietary habits in subjects, another study only observed bacteroides and prevotella enterotypes in their dataset and reported that ruminococcus was an ambiguous enterotype  <cit> . the hmp dataset included gut microbiota that was rich in saturated fats and animal protein, whereas the latter study included microbiota from individuals with plant-based diets that were low in meat and high in carbohydrates  <cit> . in  <dig>  two other groups also reported that ruminococcus could not be clearly classified in their datasets, and firmicutes were identified as the dominant species in those studies  <cit> .

based on the data from these previous studies, we were interested in determining if ruminococcus is an enterotype in the gut microbiota of taiwanese individuals. to this end,  <dig> human fecal samples from adults in taiwan were collected, and the v <dig> regions of the 16s rdna gene were sequenced through paired 150-cycle reads using the illumina miseq system. a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequencing reads were sequenced in  <dig> samples, and  <dig> operational taxonomic units  were identified in each sample on average. the most abundant bacteria identified in the fecal samples were bacteroides, prevotella, and enterobacteriaceae, and their correlation with dietary habits was confirmed. a decision tree model of these three enterotypes was constructed. the accuracies of this model in training and independent testing sets were  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively.

the most significant finding in our study was the identification of enterobacteriaceae as one of the predominant subtypes in the gut microbiota. this species may be a new subtype of enterotypes in the asian population.

RESULTS
sequencing data statistics
we conducted  <dig> , <dig> sequencing reads on  <dig> stool samples. after filtering the sequences that did not fit the criteria, we further analyzed  <dig> , <dig> sequencing reads. after taxonomy assignment,  <dig> , <dig> sequencing reads were aligned to genes in the 16s rdna database that had a sequence similarity of at least 97%;  <dig> otus for each sample were identified on average. detailed information on the sequencing reads is listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

enterotype identification in the fecal samples
nine β-diversity matrices were used to identify the enterotypes in fecal samples via three clustering methods: hierarchical clustering , partitioning around medoids , and k-means . the optimal number of clusters was two using unweighted unifrac distance. principal coordinate analysis  was also used to observe patterns in the stool samples. according to the euclidean distance matrix, two clusters were shown in opposite areas , the major bacteria in which were bacteroides and prevotella. in contrast, the other samples  were scattered. compared with the pcoa results of weighted unifrac distance , the samples were grouped into three clusters, and the predominant bacterium in the third cluster was identified as escherichia. figure  <dig> shows the results of hc of the stool samples. the unsupervised classification method produced a dendrogram of the clustering results , and the results of four clustering algorithms of weighted unifrac showed high concordance . then three enterotypes were classified as containing escherichia , bacteroides , and prevotella  , and two small unconventional regions were found. one region was located in the prevotella-predominant group  and contained six samples. the abundance of prevotella and bacteroides showed a high positive correlation within the samples. in addition, nine samples, with a relatively high abundance of bacteroides and low abundance of escherichia, were classified into the bacteroides-predominant group using the pam method . moreover, the abundance of bacteria at the family level was similar to that at the genus level . hence, the results of clustering may be improved on the basis of the family level.table  <dig> summary of optimal cluster numbers

characteristics of the enterotypes
the bar charts  illustrate the relative abundance of bacteria among the three enterotypes. in enterotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  the major bacteria were bacteroides, escherichia, and prevotella, which accounted for over half of the bacteria. in contrast, in enterotype  <dig>  prevotella were not the most abundant bacteria; the most abundant bacteria in this enterotype were bacteroides, which accounted for almost half of the bacteria. in enterotypes  <dig>  the abundance of bacteroides was at least twofold higher than that of prevotella. the relative abundance of escherichia and bacteroides in enterotype  <dig> was almost equal. figure 3b shows the predominance of the three most abundant bacteria in the three enterotypes. the abundance of escherichia was almost similar in both enterotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  the abundance of bacteroides in enterotype  <dig> was higher than that in enterotype  <dig>  and the abundance of prevotella in enterotype  <dig> was higher than that in enterotype  <dig>  the proportion of bacteroides was inversely correlated with that of prevotella  . these results correspond to the bacterial abundance in enterotypes  <dig> and  <dig> fig.  <dig> bacterial community of three enterotypes: a bacterial proportion in the three enterotypes and b major bacteria in the three enterotypes

enterotype phenotypes
the questionnaire given to the study subjects included questions about three major determinants regarding the samples. the first was the shape of feces, which was categorized by participants according to the bristol stool scale. scores of 1– <dig> represented “hard” stool, a score of four represented “mid,” and scores of 5– <dig> represented “watery” that had a high water content  <cit> . the second determinant was the frequency of excretion. at least one excretion every 2 days was designated “d1+,” excretion two to three times a week was designated “d <dig> ” and excretion once a week or less referred to as “constipation.” the third variable was “protein type,” which referred to the major source of protein in daily diets: the non-red meat group included individuals who eat beans/vegetables, fish, and poultry and the red meat group included individuals who mostly eat livestock.

table  <dig> demonstrates the association between enterotypes and several other factors such as gender, protein, shape, and stool frequency. twice as many females as males were classified as enterotype  <dig> . in both enterotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  the gender ratio was close to 1: <dig> , which is similar to the results of previous studies  <cit> . the number of individuals who consumed large quantities of red meat was twice the number of individuals who did not consume red meat consumers in enterotype  <dig> but half the number in enterotypes  <dig> and type  <dig>  . according to the results of the bristol stool scale, feces shape showed a significantly higher correlation with enterotype  <dig> than water content  . food digestion time  in enterotype  <dig> was significantly higher than that in enterotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  . in addition, a higher digestion time was strongly associated with a high red meat diet  .table  <dig> association between enterotypes and various other factors from the questionnaire

enterotype pathway enrichment analysis
enterotype  <dig> shows higher pathway activity than enterotype  <dig> or enterotype  <dig> in some kegg pathways  . two metabolic pathways are related to terpenoid biosynthesis; three pathways are related to infections such as virus and parasite; two pathways are associated with cancer and p <dig> dna repair system; ko <dig> is related to innate immune system.

classification of enterotypes
to construct the decision tree model for classifying three enterotypes,  <dig> features were collected from  <dig> stool samples. these features include the shannon index, f/a ratio, predominant genera and families, and enterotype-related phenotypes  . figure  <dig> shows the result of the modeling. this decision tree interpreted five rules: 1) if the abundance of prevotellaceae in a sample was greater than  <dig> , the sample was considered enterotype 3; 2) if the abundance of prevotellaceae in a sample was lesser than  <dig>  and the f/a ratio was greater than  <dig> , the sample was considered enterotype 1; 3) if the abundance of prevotellaceae in a sample was lesser than  <dig> , the abundance of bacteroidaceae was greater than  <dig> , and the f/a ratio was lesser than  <dig> , the sample was considered enterotype 2; 4) if the abundance of prevotellaceae and bacteroidaceae in a sample was lesser than  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, the abundance of enterobacteriaceae was greater than  <dig> , and the f/a ratio was lesser than than  <dig> , the sample was considered enterotype 3; and 5) if the abundance of prevoteallaceae, bacteroidaceae, and enterobacteriaceae in a sample was lesser than  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, and the f/a ratio was lesser than  <dig> , the sample was considered enterotype  <dig>  rules 1– <dig> categorized  <dig> % samples into three enterotypes. in total,  <dig> samples were used as independent testing sets to evaluate the performance of the decision tree model. table  <dig> shows the performance of the training and testing sets, the accuracies of which were  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively.fig.  <dig> decision tree model of the three enterotypes. this model provided five rules. each rule could classify one of three enterotypes. for instance, if the bacterial abundance of prevotellaceae was over  <dig>  in one sample, the sample was considered enterotype  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to identify enterotypes in stools from taiwanese adults. our findings revealed a new subtype of an enterotype predominant by family enterobacteriaceae. the identification of this new subtype may have been due to the ethnic group, dietary habits, and locations studied. a decision tree model of enterotypes was constructed, and the accuracies of the training and independent test used to fit the model were  <dig>  and 84%, respectively, which validated the model. several associations between dietary habits and enterotype were identified in this study. table  <dig> shows the predominant bacteria based on statistical hypothesis tests and several features. the microbial interaction network showed three bacteria , which belong to the same family . in contrast to our findings, enterobacteriaceae was found in a large number of patients with constipation from irritable bowel syndrome  <cit> .table  <dig> significant genus lists categorized by enterotype-related metadata

enterotype-related phenotypes provide data for observing the gastrointestinal tract with the nature of continual flux  <cit> , e.g., nutrient substrate, water context, or transition status. with regard to stool frequency, the amount of dialister and akkermansia in “d05” was higher than that in “d1 + .” according to previous studies, the amount of dialister was higher in individuals with a high protein diet  <cit>  and the amount of akkermansia was higher in those with a fiber-free diet  <cit> . with regard to shape, the amounts of parabacteroides and prevotella in hard stool were higher than those in watery stool. previous studies also showed that the amount of prevotella was higher in ethnic groups that had a high fiber diet and lower in ethnic groups that adopted a western diet  <cit> . with regard to protein type, the red meat group had abundance of bifidobacterium and akkermansia and the non-red meat group had abundance of megamonas. higher levels of lipid in the diet increased the amount of bifidobacterium because it has the ability to digest lipids  <cit> . enterotype  <dig> lacks of predominant bacteria such as prevotella and bacteroide, which may lead to a functional imbalance or a potential infectious risk via kegg pathways .

microflora, enterotype-related phenotypes, and short-chain fatty acids  were theoretically interwoven as a large association network  <cit> . our study validates the connections among those factors . scfas are byproducts of dietary fiber fermentation through microbiota, and they predominantly include acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. scfas can promote the growth of bacteria and can be absorbed by humans. different types of scfas are sources of energy in different organs and are associated with intestinal diseases. several factors control scfa production in the gut, such as the amount and type of bacteria and the food retention time. the amounts of scfas affect ph of the intestine, for example, a higher concentration of scfas leads to lower ph. the ph value is associated with the composition of the bacterial community. the complex interaction network in the gut includes the amount of scfas, ph value of the intestine, and composition of the bacterial community.

our results provide a predictive model for further analysis and new insights into enterotypes. an individual may change his/her enterotype by making dietary changes because the characteristics of enterotypes depend on an individual’s dietary habits. although some researchers pointed that the gut microbiome should not category as ‘enterotypes or faecotypes’ since there is no clearly separation among clusters  <cit> . the classification may be blurred, yet the different features are still there. thus, knowing one’s enterotype may allow doctors to outline the best diet for patients and to prescribe the most effective drugs.
