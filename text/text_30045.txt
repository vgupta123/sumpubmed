BACKGROUND
acidithiobacillus thiooxidans , an extremely acidophilic, chemolithoautotrophic, gram-negative, rod-shaped microorganism, which are typically related to copper mining operations , has been well studied for industry applications. a. thiooxidans grows and survives by autotrophically utilizing elemental sulfur and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds  as energy source  <cit> , but it cannot use energy or electrons acquired from the oxidation of ferrous iron ) for carbon dioxide fixation as well as other anabolic processes  <cit> .

previous studies showed that the oxidation of elemental sulfur and riscs was found in various strains of acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans  through the detection of several enzymatic activities  <cit> , but some of these activities were not associated with specific genes. the studies of oxidation and electron transfer pathways for elemental sulfur or riscs are more complicated than those for ferrous iron, making the gene prediction and pathway clarification much more difficult  <cit> . furthermore, some steps independent of enzymatic catalysis took place spontaneously, which adds the difficulty to modeling the mechanism of such a pathway. fortunately, the method based on genome sequence analysis could provide the opportunities to predict some of these missing assignments, and also to suggest novel genes involved in the oxidation of elemental sulfur or riscs such as sulfide, thiosulfate, and tetrathionate  <cit> .

elemental sulfur exists in the form of a stable octasulfane ring  in nature, which forms orthorhombic crystals with extremely poor water solubility  <cit> . an activation prior to oxidation was postulated  <cit> . the first and critical step of sulfur oxidation could be an opening of the s <dig> ring by the thiol groups of cysteine residues, resulting in the formation of thiol-bound sulfane sulfur atoms   <cit> . subsequently, the r-s-snh is transported into the periplasm and then oxidized by sulfur dioxygenase , of which gene has  not yet been detected  <cit> .

as sulfide was found to be one of the most common forms of s in the inorganic sulfur compounds, the initial step in riscs oxidation mainly was the transition of sulfide into s <dig> <cit> , forming a conjugated sulfur compound bound to a membrane fraction  <cit> . furthermore, the first step of hydrogen sulfide oxidation is its conversion to sulfur or polysulfide in many phototrophic and chemotrophic bacteria by flavocytochrome c , or by sulfide quinone reductase , which are located in the periplasm and the periplasmic surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, respectively  <cit> . moreover, fcc does not exist in various sulfide-oxidizing bacteria and appears to be restricted to certain species which possess the ability of thiosulfate oxidation  <cit> .

compared with the enzymes described above, the sulfur oxidizing  system has been elaborated in facultatively lithoautotrophic paracoccus pantotrophus . it is located in the periplasm and comprised of soxxa , soxyz , soxb , and sox  <dig> , which mediate hydrogen sulfide-, sulfur-, thiosulfate- and sulfite-dependent cytochrome c reduction  <cit> . in contrast to the p. pantotrophus, the sox  <dig> complex is absent in the truncated sox system of many α-proteobacteria  <cit> .

the periplasmic thiosulfate is synthesized spontaneously from sulfite and a sulfur atom  <cit> , and then catalyzed to generate tetrathionate by thiosulfate:quinone oxidoreductase , which is constituted of a large subunit  and a smaller subunit ; tetrathionate is then hydrolyzed by tetrathionate hydrolase  to produce thiosulfate and other uncertain products. teth was studied previously in a. ferrooxidans <cit> , and the teth gene cluster has been also characterized in acidithiobacillus caldus   <cit> .

in addition, other riscs oxidation enzymes were identified in acidithiobacillus spp. including: rhodanese or thiosulfate sulfurtransferase  and heterodisulfide reductase . the tst widely exists in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. it cleaves the sulfur-sulfur bond of thiosulfate to yield sulfur and sulfite, and then the former is transferred to a thiophilic acceptor such as cyanide and thiol compounds  <cit> . the cytoplasmic heterodisulfide reductase complex hdrabc was reported to catalyze the reversible reaction of the disulfide bond x-s-s-x reduction accompanied with energy conservation in sulfate reducing archaea and bacteria and methanogenic archaea  <cit> , while this complex was only speculated from transcriptomics and genomics analysis instead of biochemical experiments in a. ferrooxidans <cit> .

recently, a model of electron transfer pathways involved in the sulfur oxidation of a. ferrooxidans was proposed, in which electrons released from risc oxidation were transferred either to terminal oxidases to produce proton gradient or to nadh complex i to generate reducing power via the quinol pool   <cit> . however, the lack of genetic manipulation systems has greatly restricted the exploration of the molecular biology and physiology in extreme acidophilic microorganisms, and considerably less information is known about the mechanism by which microorganisms grow, survive and proliferate in extremely acidophilic environments. with the ongoing and rapid development of sequencing technologies and the continuous improvement of bioinformatics-based analytical methods, effective tools have been offered for investigating metabolic and regulatory models  <cit> . a substantial body of information could be acquired by deep genome analysis, which can assist the laboratory scientists to focus on experimental investigation of several most significant predictions, thus save considerable time and efforts  <cit> .

to get a better understanding of how these metabolic processes occur and further explore how to make them more efficient in a. thiooxidans, the whole-genome sequencing was carried out. through bioinformatics analysis of the bioleaching bacterium, a. thiooxidans genome sequence, it is expected that we would predict and validate the genes and conserved gene clusters involved in sulfur oxidation. subsequently, a further experiment at the transcriptional level was performed via quantitative real-time pcr . on the basis of bioinformatics analysis, together with qrt-pcr data, a putative model of sulfur oxidation in a. thiooxidans was proposed.

predicted genes involved in sulfur oxidation
sulfur oxidation with sulfide, sulfur, sulfite, thiosulfate and tetrathionate as various oxidation states is the main pathway from a complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate  <cit> . based on genome sequence analysis, genes predicted to be involved in the oxidation of elemental sulfur and riscs and electron transfer were detected in the genome . it reveals that most of putative genes for sulfur oxidation  in a. thiooxidans also exist in a. caldus <cit>  and other microbial representatives derived from extreme acidic environments. especially, the candidate genes potentially encoding sulfur dioxygenase  were detected in a. thiooxidans a <dig>  in addition, a. thiooxidans also has genes encoding phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate  reductase and adenylylsulfate  kinase.

the first documented step in elemental sulfur oxidation is the transition of sulfur to thiosulfate, which is catalyzed by sdo. in a. thiooxidans, three putative sdo orthologs located at the draft genome sequence  belong to the large and considerably variable metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily , which have the signature motif h-x-h-x-d-h . previous research revealed that sdo in urechis unicinctus  possessed the conserved metal i binding sites , metal ii binding sites  and potential glutathione  binding sites   <cit> . as is depicted in figure  <dig>  their conserved sites in at-sdo are much similar to aev <dig>  and the possible reason why gsh binding sites between them is slightly different may be their distant relationship. thus, the conserved regions observed with u. unicinctus as well as sdos from other species possibly indicate the similar functional properties. however, the properties of sdo-like protein in a. thiooxidans are required further studies. another gene encoding sulfide quinone reductase  was detected in the draft genome sequence of a. thiooxidans a <dig>  and the product of sqr gene shares 79% and 72% identity with other sqr ortholog identified in a. ferrooxidans and a. caldus, respectively .

other enzymes reported to be involved in sulfur oxidation are tqo and teth. our sequence analysis revealed that the homolog of doxda existed in the draft genome of a. thiooxidans a <dig>  and it is predicted to encode a thiosulfate:quinone oxidoreductase , and also has a conserved doxd domain  and a conserved doxa domain . there is a fusion of separate doxd- and doxa–like subunits that were reported previously in a. ferrooxidans doxd  <cit> . the putative teth of a. thiooxidans shares 60% and 77% identity with teth in a. ferrooxidans and a. caldus respectively, indicating their high similarity in orthologous relationship. our analysis also indicates that teth of all sequenced acidithiobacillus spp. has a conserved pyrrolo-quinoline quinone  domain . although teth was predicted to be external membrane proteins, experimental evidence showed that it was a soluble periplasmic homo-dimer with an optimum ph of  <dig> in a. caldus <cit> . previous studies have revealed that there is a teth gene cluster in a. caldus <cit> , which is comprised of five cotranscribed genes, tpase <dig>  rsrr, rsrs, teth and doxd. while in the draft genome sequence of a. thiooxidans a <dig>  only teth and doxd located at the upstream constitute the teth cluster .

in addition, bioinformatics analysis identified a truncated sox sulfur oxidizing system in a. thiooxidans a <dig>  which contains two sox gene clusters, sox cluster i  and sox cluster ii , and both are quite differ from those of paracoccus denitrificans, pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans and starkeya novella: soxrsvwxyzabcdefgh , soxgtrsvwxyzabcd  and soxfdcbzyaxwv   <cit> . comparison of all genes sequences in two sox clusters of a. thiooxidans a <dig> to those of thiobacillus denitrificans atcc  <dig>  revealed amino-acid sequence identities in the range of 35% to 51%. unlike the sox cluster ii of a. thiooxidans a <dig>  however, there is only additional soxxa in the genome sequence of t. denitrificans atcc  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, significant sequence similarity  and relatively conserved gene constitution of a. thiooxidans a <dig> sox gene clusters to those of a. caldus sm- <dig>  indicated the similar functional properties .

furthermore, heterodisulfide reductase  has been postulated to be involved in sulfur oxidation. all genes  of hdr were found in the draft genome of a. thiooxidans a <dig>  the putative hdra subunit is flavoprotein within a fad binding domain and a nad -binding rossmann-like domain. the hdrb subunit contains the typical cysteine-rich domain and the remaining hdrc subunit contains 4fe-4s dicluster domain. in addition, all putative hdr subunits in a. thiooxidans a <dig> suggested over 90% identities to the respective hdr subunits compared with a. ferrooxidans and a. caldus .

five genes encoding rhodanese  were detected and one of them was used to design primer for qrt-pcr . the phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate  reductase and adenylylsulfate  kinase, which consecutively oxidize sulfite to produce sulfate via an indirect pathway, were found in the genome of a. thiooxidans. two genes encoding aps kinase and three genes encoding paps reductase were predicted in the draft genome but their roles in sulfur oxidation remain to be established.

the genome information showed that a. thiooxidans a <dig> contains two gene clusters potentially encoding components of the nadh quinone-oxidoreductase complex  similar to that in a. caldus <cit> . in addition, seven copies of bd ubiquinol oxidase genes  and two gene clusters encoding bo

 ubiquinol oxidase  exist in a. thiooxidans a <dig>  however, components of the aa
3
-type cytochrome oxidase genes  only exist in the a. ferrooxidans <cit> .

the sulfur oxygenase reductase gene  found in a. thiooxidans
as the initial enzyme in the aerobic sulfur oxidation of thermophilic archaea  <cit>  and acidophilic bacteria  <cit> , the sulfur oxygenase reductase  has been identified. sor simultaneously catalyzes elemental sulfur to produce sulfite, thiosulfate, and sulfide  <cit> , which are oxygen-dependent disproportionation reactions. the catalytic reaction has certain characteristics:  the enzyme involved in this reaction is soluble and located in cytoplasm  <cit> ;  the optimum ph and temperature for activity are founded to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and 65–85°c , respectively  <cit> ; and  it does not require cofactors or external electron donors/acceptors for activity  <cit> .

the sulfur oxidation system based on the sulfur oxygenase reductase was only reported in several acidophilic and thermophilic archaea  or bacteria , but not in the species of a. ferrooxidans and a. thiooxidans <cit> . however, our annotations show that a potential gene encoding sor with very similar amino acid sequence in a. caldus, was detected in a. thiooxidans a <dig>  interestingly, the sor gene was not found in the draft genome sequence of a. thiooxidans atcc  <dig>  <cit> . to date, it is unclear whether sor gene exists or not in a. thiooxidans atcc  <dig> unless the complete genome sequence is obtained. subsequently, homology search was performed with blastx, and sequence analysis indicated that the putative enzyme of a. thiooxidans a <dig> shared 80% identity to the sor of a. caldus. moreover, the phylogenetic tree, which included almost all homologs of sor derived from blastp search showed that sor from a. thiooxidans was detected to be closest to that isolated from a. caldus. high bootstrap values insure the reliability of clustering .

in addition, homology searches showed that the nucleotide sequence of this putative gene in a. thiooxidans and its predicted amino acid sequence have high similarities to other species. multiple sequence alignment of sors from a. thiooxidans and other species was carried out . it is demonstrated that three cysteine residues located in two separately conserved domains, c <dig> at v-g-p-k-v-c <dig> and c <dig> and c <dig> at c102-x-x-c <dig>  are essential to its activity  <cit> . in addition, the conserved motif h87-x3-h91-x23-e <dig>  which is considered to be iron binding site  <cit> , is detected in sor from a. thiooxidans. the crystal structure of the sor in a. ambivalens is demonstrated to be a large homo-multimer composed of  <dig> identical monomers of  <dig> residues, forming a large hollow sphere  <cit> . the active sites of sor are constituted of a mononuclear non-heme iron site and three conserved cysteine residues  <cit> . furthermore, the structural analysis has been performed to study the potential functions of the cysteine residues in a. tengchongensis. it is proposed that c <dig> residue constitutes most possibly the substrate binding site and that c <dig> and c <dig>  together with the iron binding motif h87-x3-h91-x23-e <dig>  probably form the catalytic site.

so far as we know, the sor gene is for the first time detected and reported in a. thiooxidans. the discovery of sor gene supplies a novel idea that these genome-based predictions can offer new opportunities to detect similar genes in other microorganisms and also provide new markers to explore the metabolic pathways. however, the further biochemical experiments at the transcription and protein levels should be carried out in order to verify the presence or absence of sor gene.

growth of a. thiooxidans in s <dig> and na2s2o <dig> media
to examine the growth of a. thiooxidans a <dig>  starkey-s <dig> or starkey-na2s2o <dig> was used as the substrate in liquid media. the results showed that a. thiooxidans had the ability to utilize both s <dig> and na2s2o <dig> as the energy sources . furthermore, the soluble na2s2o <dig> was used prior to s <dig> and bacteria in the na2s2o <dig> medium reached stationary phase earlier than that in the s <dig> medium. moreover, the cell concentration of a. thiooxidans in the na2s2o <dig> medium was obviously higher than that in the s <dig> medium, suggesting that a. thiooxidans has a highly efficient thiosulfate oxidizing ability to enable it to grow better with na2s2o <dig> as substrate. one of possible reasons is that na2s2o <dig> can more easily and quickly enter into the organism and then be used as energy source, while s <dig> needs to be activated before it is transferred into the periplasm, resulting in a slower growth and lower cell concentration with s <dig> as substrate.

expression of selected genes involved in sulfur oxidation
to understand how those identified key genes involved in sulfur oxidation are expressed with na2s2o <dig> and s <dig> as substrates, we further examined the expression of the selected sulfur oxidation genes with na2s2o <dig> as substrate compared to those with s <dig> as substrate using qrt-pcr . the gapdh gene was used as the internal control to regulate the systematic and random errors during the process of operation procedure. statistical significance was assessed by the student’s t-test, and the gene expression levels with fold change ≥  <dig>  and p-value ≤  <dig> , or with fold change ≤  <dig>  and p-value ≤  <dig>  were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. our results showed that all assayed genes were transcribed when grown in s <dig> or na2s2o <dig>  and t-test analysis revealed the significant  differences in gene expression between s0- and na2s2o3-grown cells were observed. although no obvious changes at the transcription level were detected for teth, hdra and the sox gene cluster ii , the other genes  were down-regulated at various degrees with na2s2o <dig> as substrate . based on the growth curve and qrt-pcr data, it is speculated that soluble na2s2o <dig> could quickly enter into the cell and then stimulate the up-regulation of genes involved in sulfur oxidation at the early stage, whereas the accumulation of products derived from sulfur oxidation in turn might inhibit the process of enzyme reactions and then influence the gene expression. with s <dig> as substrate, however, elemental sulfur needs to be activated before through the outer membrane, and the majority of sulfur oxidation genes including sor gene, which was detected to be the low expression level at the early growth phase in a. caldus <cit> , would play an important role till the mid-log phase.

with s <dig> in the medium, a mass of sulfur atoms  and hydrogen sulfide are produced during the activation of s <dig> and then are used as the substrates of sqr, sor, tst and hdr in succession. this could be the reason for the higher expression of sqr, sor, rhd and hdrabc in the s <dig> medium than in the na2s2o <dig> medium . our experiments showed that thiosulfate was sufficient at the mid-log phase in the na2s2o <dig> medium, thus resulting in the lower expression level of doxd and teth. the sox operon i but not sox operon ii together with a bo

 ubiquinol oxidase operon gene may make it feasible to regulate and control at their transcriptional level, thus this may be one of the reasons why the expression of the sox operon i was up-regulated in the s <dig> medium whereas the sox operon ii had no obvious changes in these two substrates.

construction of sulfur oxidation model in a. thiooxidans
in order to acquire the functional attributes of cells, it is necessary to understand the structural constitution and characters of cellular metabolic networks  <cit> . with respect to sulfur oxidation, a bioinformatics analysis of the genome sequence of organism was performed, indicating that various enzymes, enzyme complexes, and the electron transport chain components were located in different cellular compartments. based on the documented models in other acidithiobacillus species  <cit> , genome sequence analysis, our current knowledge, and experimental results in this study, a hypothetical model is developed for sulfur oxidation in a. thiooxidans a <dig> .

the first documented step in sulfur oxidation system is the activation of extracellular elemental sulfur  to thiol-bound sulfane sulfur atoms  and then it is transferred into the periplasm where it is oxidized by the sulfur dioxygenase  to produce sulfite , accompanied with the generation of hydrogen sulfide. subsequently, hydrogen sulfide could be converted to sulfur atoms  by sulfide quinone reductase  located in the cytoplasmic membrane. the sulfur atoms could be accumulated to form polymeric sulfur , and then transferred via an unknown mechanism into the cytoplasm where it is catalyzed by sulfur oxygenase reductase . the possible products of disproportionation reaction performed by sor are sulfide, thiosulfate and sulfite. sulfide could be converted to hydrogen sulfide and then oxidized by sqr, while thiosulfate is considered to be used as the substrate of rhodanese  to produce sulfite and sulfur atom. subsequently, the cytoplasmic thiol protein  that is acted as sulfur atom acceptor obtains a sulfur atom to form sulfane sulfate , and then the latter is catalyzed by the heterodisulfide reductase complex  to regenerate rsh. therefore, a cycle relied on tst and hdr is proposed: rsh acquires a sulfur atom derived from the catalysis of thiosulfate, which is catalyzed by tst, to generate rssh, and then rssh is used as the substrate of hdr to reproduce rsh  <cit> .
a. thiooxidans


in addition, sulfite could have pernicious effect on the cell unless it is digested quickly in the organism. so far, the sulfite acceptor oxidoreductase  that catalyzes sulfite to sulfate has not been identified in the genome of a. thiooxidans a <dig>  neither was the a. thiooxidans dsm  <dig> genome  <cit> . phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate  reductase and adenylylsulfate  kinase genes were discovered in a thiooxidans a <dig>  while the sulfate adenylyltransferase dissimilatory-type  gene that catalyzed adenosine - 5′ - phosphosulfate  to sulfite was not detected . therefore, another putative pathway based on paps reductase and aps kinase that catalyze sulfite to produce sulfate indirectly is proposed: sulfite is catalyzed by paps reductase and aps kinase to generate paps and aps in succession, while the latter could produce sulfate as the final product via an unknown mechanism.

another putative pathway of sulfur oxidation is that the periplasmic sulfite combines with sulfur atom to form thiosulfate spontaneously, without enzymatic catalysis. thiosulfate:quinone oxidoreductase  located in the cytomembrane is responsible for the catalysis of thiosulfate to produce tetrathionate. the thiosulfate oxidation catalyzed by tqo was illustrated previously in a. ambivalens: doxd catalyzes thiosulfate to tetrathionate and simultaneously produces two electrons, and then doxa transfers electrons to the quinone  <cit> . tetrathionate hydrolase , a soluble periplasmic enzyme, is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of tetrathionate  <cit> . the documented hydrolysates of tetrathionate in a. thiooxidans are thiosulfate and sulfate  <cit> . furthermore, sulfur atoms  may be also one of important hydrolysates, which explains why the expression level of sor gene was higher in s <dig> medium.

thiosulfate could be directly catalyzed by the incomplete sox complex to generate sulfate  <cit> . as to the truncated sox system which is absent of sox  <dig>  the well-studied pathways were provided from some valuable references  <cit> . initially, the soxxa complex oxidatively couples the sulfane sulfur of thiosulfate to a soxy-cysteine-sulfhydryl group of the soxyz complex to form soxy-thiocysteine-s-sulfate . subsequently, the terminal sulfone  group is released as sulfate by the activity of the soxb component to produce s-thiocysteine . due to the lack of the sulfur dehydrogenase sox  <dig> component, the sulfur atom of the sulfane intermediate  is plausibly dropped from soxyz or oxidized by the alternative sulfur dioxygenase  to generate soxyz-cysteine-s-sulfate   <cit> . eventually, the sulfonate moiety of soxyz-s-so3− is again hydrolyzed by soxb, regenerating soxyz in the process. in addition, other forms of sulfur except for thiosulfate could participate in the sox pathway via either enzymatic  or nonenzymatic  conjugation to soxy at the proper intermediate state  <cit> .

there is a strong connection between the expression of the sox cluster genes and the terminal oxidase genes. the hypothetical electron pathway is that electrons from the sox system are transferred via qh <dig> to the terminal oxidases  and the nadh complex .

to date, little is known about electron transfer chains in a. thiooxidans, but it has been elaborated in a. ferrooxidans. one of the electron transfer chains in a. ferrooxidans is that electrons from ferrous iron oxidation flow through cyc <dig> to rusticyanin, and then be transferred to oxygen via c-cytochrome cyc <dig> to aa <dig> cytochrome oxidase  or to nad+ via c-cytochrome cyca1 → bc <dig> complex → ubiquinone pool → nadh dehydrogenase   <cit> . another is that electrons from elemental sulfur or riscs are transferred via the quinol pool  either  directly to terminal oxidases bd or bo <dig>  or indirectly to a bc <dig> complex and a cytochrome c  or a high potential iron-sulfur protein , whose gene iro was identified to be associated with the pet ii gene cluster thought to be involved in sulfur oxidation, probably to the aa <dig> oxidase to produce a proton gradient or  to nadh complex i to generate reducing power  <cit> . however, a. thiooxidans has only the sulfur oxidation system and annotated results showed that bo3-type terminal oxidases and bd-type terminal oxidases exist in the draft genome of a. thiooxidans a <dig>  thus, the hypothesized electron transfer chain in a. thiooxidans a <dig> is proposed: electrons from sqr, tqo, sox compounds and hdr are transferred through the qh <dig> either to terminal oxidase  to produce proton gradient, or to nadh complex i to generate reducing power.

CONCLUSIONS
bioinformatics analysis of the genome sequence of a. thiooxidans a <dig> provides a valuable platform for gene discovery and functional prediction that is much important given the difficulties in performing standard genetic research in this microorganism. based on our analysis and available documented data, a hypothetical model for sulfur oxidation and electron transportation is proposed with several distinguished features. the elemental sulfur  in the outer membrane is activated and transported into the periplasm as thiol-bound sulfane sulfur atoms . and then, the r-s-snh is further oxidized in the periplasm where sdo, teth, and sox system perform their functions. the cytoplasmic membrane involving sqr and tqo is the third region with electrons transferring. in the cytoplasm, the sulfur-containing metabolites are catalyzed to eventually produce sulfate by a series of enzymes. therefore, this study provides novel insights and more instructive guides into sulfur oxidation metabolism in a. thiooxidans. however, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. for example, some genes involved in the sulfur oxidation, such as sor gene, need to be further verified via biochemical experiments, and it is critical to determine the features of key metabolic enzymes involved in sulfur oxidation mechanism, which warrants further investigations of this organism in the future.
