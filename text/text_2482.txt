BACKGROUND
mecp <dig> encodes a methylated dna-binding protein and is the causative gene of rett syndrome  <cit>   a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1: <dig>  females worldwide  <cit> . patients are apparently healthy during the first 6– <dig> months of life, then the disorder causes mental retardation, deceleration of head growth, seizures, motor dysfunction, hand stereotypies together with many other disabling symptoms  <cit> . mecp <dig> is ubiquitously expressed with  <dig> splicing isoforms, mecp2a and b  <cit> . in the brain these isoforms are developmentally and regionally regulated, with mecp2b  more abundant in adulthood. both in humans and mice the delayed onset of rtt symptoms is in accordance with the postnatal increase of the mecp2b protein  <cit> .

neuronal morphology plays a significant role in determining how neurons function and communicate. specifically, it affects the ability of neurons to receive inputs from other cells and contributes to propagation of action potentials. the morphology of neurites also affects on how information is processed by the brain  <cit> . like many disorders associated with mental retardation  <cit> , neuropathology of rtt reveals an increase in neural density due to decrease in cell size, together with reduced neurite length and branching in post mortem brains, as well as in mecp2-loss of function mutant mice . delayed development of neuronal morphological features and maintenance of functional networks  <cit>  in mecp2-null mice suggest that mecp <dig> impacts neuronal maturation  <cit> .

more recent studies have shown that rtt is not exclusively a neuronal disease. despite the low level of mecp <dig> expression in astroglia, oligodendroglia and microglia  <cit> , conditionally mecp <dig> loss in brain non-neuronal cells detrimentally influences dendritic integrity, synapses and protein expression in neurons  <cit> .

availability of many rtt mouse models  <cit>  contributed to disentangle mecp <dig> functions and demonstrate that many rtt symptoms can be reverted by postnatal re-activation of mecp <dig> expression  <cit> .

initially described as a transcriptional silencer through the binding to methylated promoters and histone deacethylases recruitment, extensive studies in mouse models have depicted mecp <dig> as a multifunctional protein able to activate gene expression, model nuclear architecture, and regulate alternative splicing and translation  <cit> . in particular, the precise role of mecp <dig> as a transcription modulator is still under investigation. expression profiling of whole brain homogenates from mecp <dig> null mice and postmortem brains from rtt patients, revealed only subtle differences. most productive efforts to identify mecp <dig> regulated-targets took into account the problem of brain heterogeneity, in terms of regionality and cellularity, as a dilution factor which leads to underestimate the actual number of deregulated genes  <cit> .

studies conducted till this date, only evaluate post-natal transcriptional profiling as well as neuronal morphological parameters in rtt mouse models. current hypothesis claims that key embryonic and perinatal developmental steps are not altered until presymptomatic stage . a candidate gene approach study has shown that expression of important proteins for neuronal maturation  is impaired at embryonic day  <dig>  in the cerebral cortex of mecp <dig> null male mice, transiently  or with a long-lasting effect  over postnatal stages  <cit> . furthermore, mecp <dig> has been shown to promote heterochromatin reorganization during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells and in mouse primary cortical neurons  <cit> . in turn, chromatin organization changes are essential for neuronal development, as they impact on gene expression.

in light of these findings, in this study we investigate the effects of mecp <dig> loss of functions in earlier developmental stages than those analysed so far. by performing morphological analyses of primary embryonic cortical neurons dissected from mecp <dig> null mouse brains we show reduced neuritic arborization due to mecp <dig> loss of function. we profiled embryonic wild type  and mecp2-/y  gene expression using rna-sequencing assays. the availability of cell-type specific datasets, allowed us to use bioinformatics methods to isolate neuron enriched deregulated genes affected by mecp <dig> deficiency. results from our study suggest a role of non-neuronal brain cells variability for reproducibility and validity of gene expression profiling readouts.

RESULTS
mecp <dig> deficiency impairs primary branching of embryonic cortical neurons
we examined primary cultures of neurons dissected from e <dig> cerebral cortices of mecp <dig> null embryos  to investigate whether changes in neuronal morphology already occur during early brain development of rtt mouse models. since mecp <dig> starts to be expressed in cortical layers at e <dig>   <cit>  mostly in early neuronal committed cells  <cit> , we chose this stage to dissect cortices of mecp <dig> null and wt littermates. we considered embryonic neuronal primary cultures a useful tool to address our topic, as considerable information has been gathered on their neuronal development and maturation  <cit> .

primary cultures are often heterogeneous and require characterization of their cell types  and neuronal sub-types. these latter may be identified through neurotransmitter synthesized- and/or region-specific markers. the phenotype of our cells was investigated by immunofluorescence experiments performed with cell-type specific antibodies. cells were labeled with anti- β-tubulin-iii , gabaergic neurons with anti-gaba  and astrocytes with anti-gfap . more than 90 % of cortical cells in wt and mecp <dig> null mouse cultures were neurons, as judged by counting the tuj <dig> positive cells counterstained with the nuclear marker dapi . the percentage of gabaergic positive neurons over tuj <dig> positive cell was about 30–35 %, whereas gfap-positive cells were rare . an additional figure file shows this in more detail .fig.  <dig> immunocytochemical staining of cortical primary cultures derived from wt and mecp <dig> null mouse e <dig> embryos. cortical neurons were immunostained using an anti- tuj <dig> antibody  and representative images are shown. cell bodies were counterstained with the nuclear marker dapi . magnification: 20x; leica dmi <dig> b inverted microscope



subsequently to characterization, cortical cells were stained with tuj <dig> antibody and morphometrically analyzed. we will refer to neurites because cells were in vitro cultured for only three days, not enough time to distinguish axons from dendrites. the length of the neurites was estimated by measuring the distance from the cell soma to the end of the primary neurites . neurite branching was estimated by sholl analysis, one of the most commonly used methods to quantify neuronal dendritic complexity  <cit> . we find that the length of neurites does not differ between wt and mecp <dig> null neuronal cultures . on the contrary, total branching and primary branching  are significantly lower in mecp <dig> null neurons compared to age-matched wt control .fig.  <dig> morphometrical analysis of cortical primary cultures from wt and mecp <dig> null mouse e <dig> embryos. neuronal primary cultures were used to compare morphological parameters between wt and mecp <dig> null condition. a neurite length was measured on cells stained with anti-tuj <dig> antibody . the image on the right shows a representative tuj <dig> immunostaining  of cortical neurons counterstained with the nuclear marker dapi . the operator manually drew the dashed yellow line from the soma  to the end of the primary neurite in order to measure neurite length. b total and primary branching was evaluated by sholl analysis. its internal algorithm creates a series of consecutive concentric circles centered on the soma of the neuron and counts the number of neurites crossing these circles . the bars represent means ± sem from randomly selected fields for each cell culture condition . * p <  <dig> 



mecp <dig> deficiency impairs gene expression of embryonic cortical cells
primary cell cultures from wt and mecp <dig> null mice were profiled by rna-sequencing to obtain a high- resolution dataset and search for cortical genes possibly affected by mecp <dig> loss during early mouse development.

as mecp <dig> is an x-linked gene, we collected only male embryos to avoid the confounding effect of x chromosome inactivation typical of females on gene expression profiles. the inbred c57bl/6 j strain was used to minimize genetic background influence. in order to minimize inter-individual variability, rna isolated from cells of single embryos was pooled accordingly to mecp2-genotypes in three samples/genotype  and rna from each sample was sequenced.

we obtained  <dig> million of reads per sample with quality scores higher than q <dig>  mapping on average 96 % of them to mus musculus reference genome sequence . a hierarchical clusterization based on correlation was performed to check the quality of the samples . one null and one wt samples did not cluster properly , thus they were excluded from further analysis.

total reads related to mecp <dig> were comparable among wt samples  suggesting similar levels of expression. in null samples, few mecp <dig> specific reads  mapped exclusively downstream to the deleted part of the gene. in addition, we found intergenic reads spanning the 3 kb genomic region from mecp <dig> 3′utr to irak <dig> locus . the counts per million  of the reads mapping in this region was  <dig>  and  <dig>  for mecp2-/y and wt samples, respectively. the observed difference was found to be statistically significant after welch two sample t-test  and transcription of this region was confirmed by rt-pcr with two different sets of primers .

as for the overall transcripts data set, by quantitative comparison and using a q-value  ≤ <dig>  we find  <dig> differentially expressed  genes in e <dig> cortical neurons of null mice versus wt littermates, with  <dig> up-regulated  and  <dig> down-regulated  genes. de genes cluster in  <dig> classes  according to their expression profiles and their average fold-change . down-regulated genes show a mean fc of − <dig> , whereas most part of up-regulated genes shows a mean fc of  <dig> . among up- regulated genes belonging to cluster_ <dig>  we find gfap  commonly referred to as an astrocyte marker. even if gfap has been already reported as a mecp2-target in rtt patients  <cit>  and in mecp2-knock down rat model  <cit>  this finding was not fully expected. indeed gfap was not found deregulated in primary astrocyte cultures prepared from postnatal day  <dig> cerebral cortex of the same null mouse strain  <cit>  we used in this study. in fact, transient upregulation of gfap in mecp2-deficient cells seems to be female specific at least in amygdala and hypothalamus  <cit> , whereas it increases in the hypothalamus of a male transgenic mouse overexpressing mecp <dig> under its endogenous promoter  <cit> .fig.  <dig> percentage distribution of differentially expressed  genes across clusters of fc average. k-means clustering applying pearson correlation as distance metric identifies  <dig> clusters based on the mean fold change of the  <dig> de genes. cluster_ <dig> includes all down-regulated genes . up-regulated genes  are enriched in cluster_ <dig> and broadly distributed in cluster_ <dig> and clusters_ 4–7



aldh1l <dig> , another gene mapping to the same fc based cluster of gfap , is up- regulated as well in null samples versus controls. aldh1l <dig> strongly labels many more astrocytes than gfap  <cit> . this finding, together with the fact that primary cells were 90 % composed of neurons , suggested us to verify whether the expression of other non-neuronal markers occurred across profiled samples. microglia and oligodendrocyte markers  are indeed expressed in our in vitro cellular system, even if their expression ranged from very low to slightly low levels .

bioinformatics cell sorting reveals neural differentially expressed genes at embryonic developmental stage
we next wanted to verify the hypothesis that some of the differentially expressed genes that we identified could be of non-neuronal origin. to do this we bioinformatically sorted the cells using available gene expression microarray data from the main central nervous system  neural cell types  <cit> . we map the  <dig> differentially expressed genes resulted from rna- sequencing across three different neural cell types. figure  <dig> shows that 34 % of de genes found in this study may be collected specifically under the astrocyte-signature , 9 %  under oligodendrocyte- cell type, while 14 %  of genes may be enriched in neuronal cells. we classify the remaining  <dig> de genes  as unmapped. most of these latter genes  were present on the genechip microarray  used in cahoy’s study  <cit>  but probably they have not any cell type specificity. moreover, as the expression of microglia marker-cd11b/itgam was found among the  <dig> unmapped genes, we compared them to the recently reported microglia sensome  <cit> , without finding yet any overlapping gene.fig.  <dig> distribution of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes in neural cells. the jvenn diagram compares the  <dig> de genes of this study  with genes representing the transcriptional signature of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes . focusing on genes specifically enriched in each cell-type we find:  <dig> neuronal genes,  <dig> astrocytes genes,  <dig> oligodendrocytes genes. unmapped genes are  <dig>  whereas  <dig> genes are shared between two cell- types



differentially expressed genes with astrocyte transcriptional signature
firstly, we compared the list of the  <dig> genes enriched in astrocytes with those specifically deregulated in postnatal primary cultures of mecp2-/y astrocytes  <cit> . only  <dig> genes overlap with our astrocyte-enriched dataset: gabrg <dig> , encoding gaba-a receptor gamma  <dig> concordantly deregulated in both datasets; aldoc  and fgfbp <dig>  that are discordant with results of yasui . this finding, together with the fact that two astrocyte markers such as gfap and aldh1l <dig>  have been found both up-regulated in our mecp2-null derived primary cultures versus controls, raises the possibility that a larger amount of gfap+ and aldh1l1+ cells  were originally present in the null compared to the wt cultures from which rna for sequencing was isolated.

differentially expressed genes with oligodendrocyte transcriptional signature
among the  <dig> de genes only 9 % are enriched in oligodendrocytes . we find comparable expression of ng <dig>  a marker of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and cc <dig>  a marker of mature oligodendrocytes. these markers are not differentially expressed with the respect to the genotype of samples .

according to gene ontology  analysis  the most significantly represented biological processes are those related to ensheathment of neurons  and regulation of action potential . given that the transcriptome dataset  <cit>  profiles cells in postnatal mouse, go outcomes would have been biased towards biological process more active in postnatal stages, as myelination does.

nonetheless, go together with panther analysis  give us interesting directions of investigation to be tested, as the most enriched annotations in this category of genes are related to protein families involved in oligodendrocytes differentiation, such as olig  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , cd <dig>  <cit>  and cd <dig>  <cit> , or to lipid synthesis , such as elovl <dig>  <cit>  whose expression increases in null cells here sequenced . to be noticed, aberrant oligodendrocytes maturation could affect neuronal-non neuronal cells interactions  <cit>  as reported for astroglia. furthermore, among the  <dig> deregulated genes within oligodendrocyte- cell type no matches have been found in the cerebral cortex dataset of developmentally regulated genes  <cit>  suggesting that their expression level might be constant during brain development.

differentially expressed genes with unrecognized transcriptional signature
functional annotation of the  <dig> de genes not mapped to neurons or glial cells shows that they are significantly enriched in biological process like the tumor necrosis factor -mediated signaling pathway . in response to numerous stimuli, tnf-pathway triggers downstream effects related to cell viability, gene transcription, ion homeostasis and synaptic plasticity. this pathway as well as activated microglia are key mediators of neuroinflammation and may contribute to neuronal dysfunction.

this functional outcome may have important molecular implications on the neuronal morphological phenotype here described, as it has been shown that postnatal mecp <dig> null mouse microglia detrimentally affects dendrites and synapses by releasing an excess of glutamate  <cit> .

in addition, as perturbation of embryonic microglial activity impairs normal assembling of cortical networks  <cit>  there could be a causal relationship between mecp2-deficient microglia and forebrain connectivity even during embryonic development.

the microglial marker cd11b indeed maps to this category but it results to be up-regulated in our mecp <dig> null cell cultures versus wt control, possibly indicating a different distribution of cd11b+ cells across profiled samples, as another report indicates that cd11b is not altered by mecp <dig> deficiency  <cit> .

differentially expressed genes with neuronal transcriptional signature
of the  <dig> genes assigned to neuronal cells, forty-three genes  are more expressed in mecp <dig> null cells than in wt while the remaining twenty-seven genes  are down-regulated .

before further characterizing these genes we checked whether neuronal and gabaergic markers were equally expressed across samples. the overall number of neurons does not differ between wt and null samples, as previously shown by tuj1-immunofluorescence staining  and then confirmed at transcriptional level by rna-sequencing . similarly, there are no differences in expression level of: a) gabaergic marker-transcripts, such as gaba synthesis enzyme gad <dig> ; b) gad <dig> ; c) genes encoding the gaba transporters, such as slc32a <dig> and slc6a <dig> together with dlx <dig> and arx  <cit>  .

assuming homogeneity of samples, the list of de genes carrying a neuronal transcriptional signature was then analyzed, to search for functional categories more enriched and potentially targeted by mecp <dig> loss. functional clustering  shows  <dig> significantly represented clusters , with three molecular function terms  and four biological process annotations . interestingly, the major functional themes assigned are specifically related to neuron specific features, such as neurogenesis and cell differentiation  together with neuronal activities. indeed, ion binding , transport  and channel activity  altogether sustain synaptic transmission. among genes listed in these functional clusters, some contribute to shape neuronal morphology, such as mef2c and tiam <dig> . another interesting gene found in these clusters is gda encoding guanine deaminase, a protein involved in microtubule assembling  <cit>  and regulation of dendrites number  <cit> . to further validate the go and functional annotation results, we carried out enrichments analysis of each go and functional terms separately for the given list of neuronal specific genes. we obtained enriched go and functional terms along with multiple test corrected p-values . together with david annotation, we carried out go annotation analysis through amigo  <dig>  obtaining significant go terms using bonferroni correction method . the results  confirm the biological inference for the neuronal specific genes obtained by david analysis.fig.  <dig> functional annotation clustering of neuronal specific differentially expressed genes. using functional annotation clustering algorithm in-built in david web resource, seven functional annotation clusters based on go terms  were obtained within neuronal specific differentially expressed genes. each cluster is significantly enriched with enrichment score cut-off value > <dig>  within each cluster, all the related gene ontological terms are also separately enriched for the given neuronal specific gene with ease score value  cut-off ≤  <dig> . note that the most enriched biological process go terms fall within clusters e and f and are related to specific neuronal functions. no cellular compartment cluster was sufficiently enriched



to understand whether the neuronal genes mis-regulation we found at embryonic stage is conserved throughout development, we compared our data with a number of gene expression studies profiling various brain regions of postnatal mecp <dig> mutant brain. to avoid any mouse background confounding effects, we focused our interest in regions dissected from the same mecp <dig> null mouse strain  <cit>  analyzed in this study. we find that the highest rate of sharing is achieved with hypothalamic genes: twenty-seven out of seventy genes  are differentially expressed in postnatal hypothalamus of mecp <dig> null mice  <cit>  with  <dig> genes  deregulated in the same direction . only two genes are concordantly shared with cerebellum of mecp <dig> null mice, with pls <dig>  gene also present in the hypothalamus list . the pairwise comparison of the  <dig> neuronal de genes with those published by zhao and colleagues  <cit>  in symptomatic p <dig>  mecp <dig> null mice  revealed only  <dig> genes in common . nonetheless, all neuron related go terms above mentioned are also shared between the two datasets, uncovering specific functions of mecp <dig> regulated genes during development.

screening the cerebral cortex dataset of healthy mice  <cit>  we find  <dig> genes  merging with our neuronal enriched dataset. notably, 90 % of them become more highly expressed in adult cortex during mouse development, including 7/ <dig> deregulated genes concordant with hypothalamic findings.

finally, we find that 50 % of neuronal enriched up-regulated genes  are long genes  as already reported for mecp2-repressed genes  <cit> .

discussion
neuroanatomical studies in cerebral cortex of mecp <dig> null mice showed delayed maturation of neuronal morphology and autonomous as well as non-cell autonomous reduction of dendritic complexity of postnatal cortical neurons. in addition, abnormal cell body size and density of both glutamatergic  and gabaergic neurons  <cit>  has been reported for a rtt mouse model  <cit>  as well as for inhibitory neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells lacking mecp <dig>  <cit> .

in this study, we describe effects of mecp <dig> loss of function both on the morphology and transcription profile of the embryonic neocortical neurons. interestingly, we find a reduced neurite branching in mecp <dig> null neurons, whereas neurites length is not affected. similar results have been recently described in inhibitory neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells lacking mecp <dig>  <cit> . in addition, we identify a neuronal subset of embryonic deregulated genes that are highly expressed in mouse adult cortex, possibly indicating that some subtle embryonic defects will be functionally amplified later in postnatal life when clinical rtt symptoms become evident. the findings in our study further support the hypothesis that mecp <dig> has a role in structural plasticity of cortical neurons and highlight the effects on the transcription of a subset of neuronal genes. it has been recently reported that mecp <dig> deficient mice display regional- and age-dependent variations in the gaba pathway and, to a lesser extent, in the glutamate pathway  <cit> . focusing on functional annotations significantly enriched in neuronal cells here profiled, we achieved additional as well as interesting results: mecp <dig> deficiency should impair the same biological process even across different brain areas and developmental stages, as suggested by the overlapping of gene ontology terms with those described for striatal deregulated genes of postnatal mecp <dig> null mice  <cit> .

however, it would be interesting to measure in our cellular system the impact of non-neuronal cells on the transcription of neuronal genes. indeed, the deregulated genes due to the mecp <dig> loss only in the striatal gabaergic neurons partially overlap with those impaired by a constitutive mecp <dig> loss  <cit> .

our bioinformatics approach on the list of differentially expressed genes in primary cultures from mecp <dig> null and wt cortices has another important outcome: on one hand allows to focus on genes with a neuron transcriptional signature, while on the other identifies non-neuronal enriched genes contribution to the list. overall findings from non-neuronal cortical cells may suffer from inter- individual variability and chance to survive in serum-free culturing medium. prior rna-sequencing, pooling of samples  may have masked such variability, giving rise only to partial conclusions of mecp <dig> loss of function effects. the simultaneous presence in our cultures of different neural populations allowed us to preserve cell-cell interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cells. this is a fundamental aspect in molecular and morphological studies of mecp <dig> null cells, as neuron-glia and -microglia interactions have emerged as a crucial point to control rtt progression and for some of them to reverse symptoms.

there is an extensive reorganization of mouse transcriptome between embryonic and postnatal developmental stages  <cit> . moreover, gene expression programs are highly divergent across cell types  <cit> . likely, not overlapping results of downstream effectors of mecp <dig> deficiency can be also affected by the specific developmental window of profiling. in addition, it has been shown that sorting methods to profile specific cell types can themselves produce in some cases not comparable results  <cit> . despite this, a small subset of deregulated neuronal genes here identified has already been described in a previous study  <cit>  at a postnatal stage and in a different brain region . we speculate that mecp <dig> loss may impact transcripts abundance of those genes in a space-temporal independent ways, starting from mid-gestation period. interestingly, at e <dig> when those genes are deregulated in the cortex, mecp <dig> protein is not detectable in hypothalamus  <cit> .

most part of neuron-enriched deregulated genes here found are up-regulated, whereas in previous studies most part of mecp <dig> deregulated genes are repressed. this discrepancy may be likely linked to different developmental stages analysed but also to the technology utilized, given that we were able to measure even very low expressed genes . however the rate of up-regulated genes here found is consistent with that reported by sugino  <cit>  based on cell type specific approach. moreover, concordantly to sugino et al.  <cit>  and gabel and et al.  <cit>  we also find that genes up-regulated by mecp <dig> loss are biased toward long genes.

in addition, rna-sequencing permitted us to confirm that irak <dig> deregulation is causally linked to genetic structural manipulation of mouse mecp <dig> locus, rather than to functional loss of mecp <dig>  indeed irak <dig> levels specifically increase in the bird strain of mecp <dig> null mice lacking exons  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , whereas in the jaenisch strain is normally expressed  <cit> . in all brain regions to date profiled  and in this study, irak <dig> is always up-regulated. our mapping of reads in the intergenic region between mecp <dig> and irak <dig> in null samples may be due to spurious transcription occurring in the absence of terminal coding part of mecp <dig> gene. it is thus reasonable to suppose that at least a subset of differentially regulated genes found in this study and by others should be considered as irak1- dependent downstream effects rather than mecp <dig> targets. among downstream effectors of irak <dig> signalling pathway there is nf-kb, a transcription factor even acting as a modulator of neurite outgrowth  <cit> . moreover, the virtual cell sorting we performed assigned irak <dig> to cells resembling activated microglia, characterized by tnf-mediated signal pathway enrichment. this finding supports an already proposed hypothesis of a constitutive activity of signalling pathways mediating the tnf- action, as mecp <dig> null microglia releases significantly less tnf-alpha under specific stimulation  <cit> . remarkably, our findings motivate further studies focused on genes involved in shaping cell morphology, whose mis-expression can lead to altered formation, pruning and maintenance of neurites and synapses. mef2c and tiam <dig>  already described as mecp <dig> target genes, may be good candidates. mef2c negatively regulates synapses number and function  <cit>  and is up-regulated by mecp <dig> loss -degrading enzyme would have a direct impact on action potential shaping of cortical neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge dendritic complexity of embryonic cortical neurons, as well as the embryonic high- resolution expression profile was never examined in mecp <dig> null mice. using a very sensitive technology we were able to profile even genes transcribed at low level, showing that our close to pure primary neuronal cultures derived from embryonic cortices may in fact contain low and poorly detectable amount of non neuronal cells. the virtual a posteriori cell sorting here described allowed also to focus specifically on differentially expressed genes of neuronal origin. we are confident that the cellular system here used could be further investigated, providing a fine characterization of neuronal subpopulation together with non-neuronal cells.

we thus suggest that abnormal morphology and altered expression profile of neurons may be very early phenotypes of rtt mouse models. furthermore, subtle embryonic defects will be functionally amplified later in postnatal life, when overt rtt phenotypes will be established.
