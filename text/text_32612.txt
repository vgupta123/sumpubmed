BACKGROUND
the zp domain is a sequence of ~ <dig> amino acids that drives polymerisation of a large number of essential secreted proteins from multicellular eukaryotes  <cit> . it has been suggested that the domain, which includes  <dig> highly conserved cys residues, consists of two subdomains  <cit> . the n-terminal subdomain  is thought to contain conserved cys  <dig> to  <dig>  disulfide-bonded with invariant 1– <dig>  2– <dig> connectivity. on the other hand, conserved cys  <dig> to  <dig>  located within the c-terminal subdomain , apparently adopt two alternative connectivities in different zp domain proteins  <cit> . in type i zp domain proteins with  <dig> cys within the zp domain, such as zp <dig>  the zp-c connectivity is 5– <dig>  6–8; in type ii zp domain proteins with  <dig> cys within the zp domain, like the other egg coat subunits zp <dig> and zp <dig>  it is 5– <dig>  7-a, b- <dig> . interestingly, type i  zp domain proteins appear to polymerise into filaments only in the presence of type ii  zp domain proteins, whereas the latter can also form homopolymers.

recently, placenta protein plac <dig> was described that bears significant homology to the n-terminal subdomain of sperm receptor zp <dig>  <cit> . based on this similarity, as well as on the observation that deletion of the x chromosome region harboring the plac <dig> gene causes fetal growth restriction and abnormal placenta development  <cit> , it was proposed that plac <dig> might be required for interaction between the trophoblast and other placental or maternal tissues  <cit> . five additional proteins, mammalian oosp1- <dig> and drosophila papillote and cg <dig>  were subsequently identified that also share homology with zp-n, but not zp-c  <cit> . in view of the higher structural conservation of zp-n, these reports raise questions about the relative contribution of the two subdomains to zp domain function. are plac1-like proteins also able to polymerise, or do zp-n sequences carry out a different role than complete zp domains?

RESULTS
identification of additional protein sequences containing only zp-n
to investigate whether other proteins exist that contain only the n-terminal half of the zp domain, we generated a profile hidden markov model  of zp-n to scan genomic and non-redundant sequence databases. this analysis identified three additional putative zp-n-containing proteins, whose genes appear to be expressed . on the other hand, no proteins containing only zp-c were found in a parallel search with a corresponding hmm profile. these observations suggest that, unlike zp-n, zp-c can be found exclusively within the context of a complete zp domain.

§this protein is referred to as zp <dig> in ref.  <dig>  however, because it contains a trefoil domain immediately before the zp domain, it should be regarded as a member of the zp <dig> family.

expression, purification and characterisation of recombinant zp-n
to establish whether zp-n is able to fold independently and investigate its biological role, we over-produced in recombinant form the plac1-homology region of the zp domain of mouse zp <dig>  the 102-amino acid zp-n fragment was expressed as an affinity sandwich  <cit> , with e. coli maltose binding protein  fused to its n-terminus via a short linker and a polyhistidine tag  fused to its c-terminus . mbp was chosen as a fusion partner since it is strictly monomeric in the presence of maltose  <cit>  and has either no or minimal interaction with the proteins to which it is fused, so that the stoichiometry of mbp fusion proteins is entirely determined by the properties of the non-mbp moieties  <cit> .

using a bacterial strain that facilitates formation of disulfides by carrying trxb and gor mutations  <cit>  and co-expressing modified versions of disulfide isomerase  <cit>  and thioredoxin  <cit> , significant amounts of mbp-zp-n-6his were obtained that could be purified to homogeneity with a two-step affinity method .

although the fusion protein was soluble, as judged by ultracentrifugation at  <dig>  g, it eluted in the void volume of  <dig> kda molecular weight  cut-off size-exclusion columns, suggesting the presence of multimers. analysis in the presence of ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid  yielded identical elution profiles, excluding the possibility that trace amounts of ni2+ ions could have leaked from the immobilised metal ion affinity chromatography  column used during purification and caused non-specific protein aggregation by cross-linking multiple histidine tags.

western blot analysis of purified mbp-zp-n-6his revealed a band corresponding to monomeric protein and, in addition, a ladder of bands corresponding to dimers, tetramers etc.  . although these multimers were much less abundant under reducing conditions, several lines of evidence suggest that this was due to more extensive denaturation of the zp domain moiety of mbp-zp-n-6his, rather than to the presence of spurious intermolecular disulfides. first, unlike the situation reported for other proteins  <cit> , no bands were observed for trimeric, pentameric, etc.  × mr) forms of mbp-zp-n-6his . second, as seen in the case of bands corresponding to the monomeric protein, dimeric and tetrameric mbp-zp-n-6his also migrated differently under reducing and non-reducing conditions . third, when samples were analysed by gel filtration under reducing conditions, most of the protein was still eluted in the void volume. fourth, mass spectrometric analysis of proteolytic digests of dimeric mbp-zp-n-6his did not reveal additional peaks compared to monomeric protein, whose spectra were consistent with native, intramolecular disulfides -cys  <dig>  and cys  <dig> -cys  <dig> )   <cit> .

structural analysis of recombinant zp-n
electron microscopy  of negatively stained mbp-zp-n-6his revealed that the protein assembles into long filaments  whose features are reminiscent of the helical structure described for full-length zp domain proteins   <cit> . moreover, a pattern was observed in immunolocalisation studies which suggests that dimeric mbp-zp-n-6his is present as repeating units within filaments .

discussion
our results indicate that e. coli-expressed mbp-zp-n-6his is correctly folded and, because mbp is monomeric and does not influence the multimerisation state of passenger proteins  <cit> , that the fusion protein assembles into filaments through its zp-n sequence. the solubility of purified mbp-zp-n-6his filaments can be explained by the well documented solubilisation properties of mbp  <cit> . furthermore, the periodicity observed by both sds-page  and em  suggests that multimerisation of mbp-zp-n-6his involves formation of non-covalently linked homodimers. consistent with these conclusions, a large portion of zp-c sequence is apparently missing from polymeric tamm-horsfall protein due to proteolytic processing between conserved cys  <dig> and  <dig> of the zp domain  <cit> . moreover, homodimerisation of full-length zp domain proteins, including mammalian zp <dig>  has been described  <cit> .

by demonstrating that zp-n is a conserved, autonomously folding unit that is biologically active, we suggest that this sequence should be considered a domain on its own and that the current definition of zp domain should be revised. plac1-like proteins are able to polymerise and this explains why the majority of zp domain mutations causing disease in humans, such as those in α-tectorin and tamm-horsfall protein, are clustered within the first half of the domain  <cit> . the importance of zp-n is also underscored by the observation that zp domain protein endoglin contains a canonical zp-n sequence whereas only  <dig> cys are conserved within its zp-c subdomain , and that some fish zp <dig> protein isoforms completely lack zp-c . the availability of a recombinant zp-n construct able to assemble into filaments that can be easily purified will be instrumental in understanding the effects of these mutations at the molecular level. our results also raise important questions about the structure of zp domain filaments and the function of zp-c. because the latter is only found as part of a complete zp domain and can adopt different disulfide connectivities  <cit> , it may play a crucial role in regulating the specificity of zp-n to determine whether or not a given zp domain protein can homo- or heteropolymerise. indeed, presence of zp-c, as well as of hydrophobic patches that regulate polymerisation of zp domain proteins  <cit> , within full-length zp <dig> could explain why – unlike its zp-n fragment – this is apparently not able to assemble into filaments in the absence of a type ii zp domain counterpart  <cit> . alternatively, it is possible that full-length zp <dig> and zp <dig> are in principle also able to homopolymerise, but the resulting filaments are not stable unless they interact with each other  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
recent studies led to the hypothesis that the zp domain, a module responsible for the polymerisation of a large number of extracellular proteins, consists of two subdomains. in this work, we identified protein sequences sharing homology exclusively with the n-terminal half of the zp domain , but did not find sequences containing only its c-terminal half . we then showed that a recombinant protein corresponding to the zp-n region of mammalian sperm receptor zp <dig> is able to fold independently from its zp-c counterpart, and that it assembles into filaments which appear to consist of dimeric subunits. our results argue that zp-n should be considered a domain of its own, suggest a function for proteins containing only zp-n, are consistent with the higher structural conservation of the n-terminal part of the zp domain, and provide an explanation for the clustering of mutations within zp-n. finally, we propose that zp-c might function by regulating zp-n-mediated polymerisation of proteins containing a full zp domain.
