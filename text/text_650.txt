BACKGROUND
acquisition of iron is essential for growth of most bacteria. however, due to insolubility at neutral ph the bioavailability of iron is extremely low in most natural environments. to circumvent this problem many bacteria respond to iron starvation by synthesizing high affinity iron-chelating molecules known as siderophores. these siderophores are secreted into the extra-cellular environment where they bind ferric iron and are then actively transported back into the cell via specific ferric-siderophore receptors  <cit> . siderophores play a prominent role in the biology of fluorescent pseudomonads, a genus renowned for occupying a very wide range of environmental niches. fluorescent pseudomonads synthesize the peptide-derived molecule pyoverdine as their primary siderophore, together with secondary siderophores that have lower affinity for iron  <cit> . although pseudomonads are not obligate pathogens, many species are capable of causing disease in a wide variety of hosts  <cit> . as iron restriction is a key host defense mechanism, pyoverdine is frequently implicated as an important virulence factor  <cit> .

pyoverdine is synthesized from amino acid precursors by non-ribosomal peptide synthetase enzymes   <cit> . it is pyoverdine that provides the fluorescent pseudomonas species with their defining fluorescence and yellow-green pigmentation under conditions of iron limitation  <cit> . these properties derive from an invariant dihydroxyquinoline chromophore, to which is attached an acyl moiety and a strain-specific peptide side chain  <cit> . more than  <dig> different pyoverdine structures have been described to date  <cit>  and the variability of the peptide side chain of pyoverdines from different strains reflects rapid evolution of both the nrps that synthesize this side chain and the outer membrane receptors that recognize ferric pyoverdine  <cit> . analysis of the pyoverdine locus of different p. aeruginosa strains indicated that it is the most divergent region in the core genome and that its evolution has been substantially shaped by horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . the diversification of pyoverdine structures is particularly interesting when viewed in the context of nrps manipulation experiments  <cit>  - the wide variety of pyoverdine structures that has resulted from natural recombination of a limited pool of nrps modules provides clues as to how nature has overcome the barriers that frequently limit artificial recombination of nrps enzymes  <cit> . moreover, the ability to detect pyoverdine production at nanomolar levels by uv-fluorescent screening  <cit>  makes the pyoverdine synthetases potentially a very attractive model system to study nrps recombination. however, in terms of providing 'raw material' for such work, the only biochemical analysis of a pyoverdine nrps to date focused on the l-threonine incorporating enzyme pvdd of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  <cit> . in the work described here we aimed to expand this focus to the nrps enzymes of another fluorescent pseudomonad, pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a , which secretes an alternative form of pyoverdine to pao <dig> 

during the course of this study, pyoverdine null mutants were generated, revealing that p. syringae 1448a  produces achromobactin as a secondary siderophore. in contrast to pyoverdine, achromobactin is synthesized by a mechanism that is entirely independent of nrps enzymes  <cit> . nrps-independent siderophores have been studied far less intensively than their nrps-dependent counterparts, and their mechanisms of synthesis have only recently begun to be deciphered. three types  of nrps-independent siderophore synthetase enzymes have been identified to date, each responsible for the attachment of a different functional group to a citric acid backbone  <cit> . the achromobactin biosynthetic pathway is a particularly valuable resource for the study of these enzymes as it relies on the action of all three types of synthetase  <cit> . achromobactin has been shown to be important for virulence in dickeya dadantii   <cit> , and both pyoverdine and achromobactin contribute to epiphytic fitness of p. syringae pv. syringae 22d/ <dig>  <cit> , but the contribution of siderophores to virulence of p. syringae 1448a has not previously been characterized. we therefore examined the roles of both achromobactin and pyoverdine in virulence of p. syringae 1448a, as well as their relative contribution to iron uptake and growth under more precisely defined conditions.

RESULTS
identification and in silico characterization of the p. syringae 1448a pyoverdine locus
the biosynthesis of pyoverdine has been most extensively studied in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and most, if not all, of the genes required for pyoverdine synthesis in this strain have now been identified  <cit> . ravel and cornelis  <cit>  used the pao <dig> pyoverdine genetic locus as a blueprint for annotation of the pyoverdine loci from three other fluorescent pseudomonads, including p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  we adopted a similar strategy to interrogate the p. syringae 1448a genome, individually blastp searching all of the known pao <dig> pyoverdine proteins against the p. syringae 1448a sequence database  <cit> .

the genomic organization of pyoverdine genes in p. syringae 1448a is highly similar to the p. syringae dc <dig> genetic locus presented by ravel and cornelis  <cit> , but less similar to that of pao <dig> . given the similarity with the p. syringae dc <dig> genetic locus and the excellent earlier analysis of ravel and cornelis, we confine our analysis of the non-nrps genes of p. syringae 1448a to two aspects not previously noted by them. the first concerns the only pao <dig> gene that clearly lacks an ortholog in p. syringae, pvdf, which encodes an enzyme required for generating the n5-formyl-n5-hydroxyornithine residues that are present in the pao <dig>  pyoverdine side chain. instead, p. syringae 1448a contains a gene  that is 37% identical at a predicted protein level to the syrp gene of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. originally mis-annotated as a putative regulatory gene, syrp has subsequently been shown to be an aspartate hydroxylase that is required for synthesis of the nrps-derived phytotoxin syringomycin  <cit> . on this basis we propose that pspph <dig> very likely catalyzes β-hydroxylation of two hydroxyaspartate residues expected to be present in the p. syringae 1448a pyoverdine side chain , with equivalent iron-chelating roles to the n5-formyl-n5-hydroxyornithine residues of pao <dig> pyoverdine. we also note that p. syringae 1448a contains two orthologs of the pao <dig> ferripyoverdine receptor gene fpva. the predicted products of these genes share  <dig> % amino acid identity with one another, and  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  with fpva from pao <dig>  pao <dig> itself contains a second type i ferripyoverdine receptor gene, fpvb, whose product is 54% identical to fpva  <cit> ; however in pao <dig> this second ferripyoverdine receptor gene lies outside the pyoverdine locus.

†gene numbers for ps1448a are as annotated in the pseudomonas genome database. genes were presumed to be orthologs if they belonged to the same cog group. hits are listed in order of significance, with those falling within the ps1448a pyoverdine locus  listed in bold.

p. syringae 1448a also contains  <dig> nrps genes that lie within the pyoverdine locus . the gene pspph <dig> presumably governs synthesis of the pyoverdine chromophore, as it shares  <dig> % predicted amino acid identity with the chromophore nrps gene pvdl of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and homologs of this gene are present in all fluorescent pseudomonads that have been examined  <cit> . likewise, the four contiguous genes pspph1923- <dig> are expected to encode the side chain nrps of p. syringae 1448a, and the total number of nrps modules in these genes  corresponds exactly with the number of amino acids in the p. syringae 1448a pyoverdine side chain. bioinformatic prediction of the substrate specificity of these modules  as well as heuristic prediction software  <cit>  revealed that their likely substrates are  l-lys, d-asp, l-thr, l-thr, l-ser, d-asp, l-ser  . assuming β-hydroxylation of the two d-asp residues as noted above, and the co-linearity that is typical of nrps clusters  <cit> , this substrate specificity is consistent with the linear order of residues identified in the pyoverdine side chains of several other p. syringae pathovars  <cit>  .

mass spectrometry of pyoverdine purified from p. syringae 1448a
to test the in silico predictions above we purified the pyoverdine species secreted by p. syringae 1448a using amberlite bead affinity chromatography as previously described  <cit> . fractions were collected and analysed for siderophore activity by addition of chromeazurol s  and the fraction with the highest activity was subjected to maldi-tof analysis to identify the mass of the primary constituents . this revealed the presence of three major positive ion peaks. one of these peaks  is consistent with the linear  pyoverdine structure portrayed in figure 1b, while another  corresponds to the cyclized form observed in other p. syringae pathovars, in which an ester bond between the c-terminal carboxyl and the side chain of the second internal threonine residue results in a lactone structure  <cit> . the third peak ,  <dig> mass units greater than linear pyoverdine, could not be explained by either the in silico characterization above or by comparison with the structures previously elucidated for other p. syringae pathovars. we hypothesized that this peak resulted from either a pyoverdine molecule bearing an alternative acyl substituent attached to the chromophore  or a contaminant that had co-purified with pyoverdine.

to test this hypothesis, and to investigate the identity and order of the amino acids present in the pyoverdine side chain, the peaks at m/z  <dig> and  <dig> were subjected to ms/ms analysis. fragmentation of the peak at m/z  <dig> resulted in the formation of a set of b ions  that corresponded exactly to the order and identity of amino acids predicted in figure 1b. in contrast, fragmentation of the peak at m/z  <dig> resulted in a series of peaks with identical spacing and intensity to those in figure 2b, but  <dig> da larger . this immediately discounted the possibility that the maldi-tof peak at m/z  <dig> arose from sample contamination. moreover, in both figure 2b and 2c there are peaks at m/z  <dig> , corresponding to the predicted mass of the pyoverdine chromophore with an attached acyl group derived from succinate. in both spectra there are also intense peaks that correspond a y-ion  formed as a result of loss of the acyl group from the chromophore; and these peaks also differ by  <dig> da. together, these results suggest that the variant pyoverdine species differs from that portrayed in figure 1b not in the structure of its chromophore, but rather in the constitution of its polypeptide side chain. finally, we note that there is a fourth, smaller peak at m/z  <dig> in the maldi-tof spectrum , which may correspond to a cyclized form of this larger pyoverdine species.

fragmentation of the m/z =  <dig> pyoverdine species resulted in identification of the following negative ions as shown in figure 2b. peaks 1- <dig> match the expected pattern of b-ions previously reported for fragmentation of other p. syringae linear pyoverdine molecules. y <dig> has the expected mass for the y ion resulting from loss of the acyl group of the chromophore. chr = chromophore, oh-d = hydroxyaspartate, all other amino acids indicated by standard one letter code.

fragmentation of the m/z =  <dig> pyoverdine species resulted in identification of the following negative ions as shown in figure 2c. the numbering and spacing of ions is identical to those listed in table  <dig>  but with peak  <dig> now representing the chromophore bearing an unknown  <dig> da substituent. y <dig> has the expected mass for the y ion resulting from loss of the acyl group of the chromophore .

genetic and biochemical analysis of the pyoverdine nrps genes
to confirm that each of the putative pyoverdine nrps genes was indeed required for pyoverdine biosynthesis, these were individually deleted in-frame from the chromosome using a rapid overlap pcr-based method  <cit> . when grown on iron-limiting king's b  media  <cit>  each nrps gene deletion strain lacked the uv fluorescence of wild type  . likewise, each of the gene deletion strains was impaired in siderophore production, assessed following  <dig> h growth on cas agar plates at 28°c ; and was unable to grow on kb agar plates containing  <dig> μg/ml eddha . these phenotypes confirmed that none of the gene deletion strains were able to produce pyoverdine. successful restoration of pyoverdine synthesis by complementation in trans indicated that these phenotypes did not result from polar effects. restoration of pyoverdine synthesis was demonstrated through the re-establishment of uv fluorescence and the ability to grow on kb agar plates containing  <dig> μg/ml eddha , as well as a positive phenotype on solid and liquid media cas assays .

to confirm the pyoverdine nrps substrate specificity assigned by in silico analysis, and also to investigate the possibility that relaxed substrate specificity for one of the nrps modules might explain the presence of a variant pyoverdine species, we sought to express and purify each side chain module as a heterologous his6-tagged protein from escherichia coli for biochemical characterization. however we were unable to recover any proteins that were functional in substrate specificity assays, despite managing to obtain soluble protein for full modules as well as isolated a-domains by several different methods . in contrast, we were able to express and purify two functional single-module nrps control proteins, entf from e. coli and bpsa from streptomyces lavendulae  <cit> .

characterization of achromobactin as a secondary siderophore of p. syringae 1448a
although the pyoverdine deficient  strains were unable to discernibly alter the color of the cas dye during  <dig> h growth on agar at 28°c , i.e. no active iron sequestration was apparent within this timeframe, some color change was observed when these plates were subsequently left at room temperature or maintained at 28°c for an extended duration. these observations suggested that the pvd- strains were secreting at least one alternative siderophore. production of the secondary siderophore appeared to be temperature dependent, with the pvd- strains exhibiting greater iron uptake at 22°c than at 28°c  . however, none of the pvd- strains were able to grow during  <dig> h incubation at either temperature on solid media containing  <dig> μg/ml eddha, indicating that the secondary siderophore had much lower affinity than pyoverdine for iron.

to identify candidate genes governing synthesis of this secondary siderophore, some known siderophore synthetase sequences from other phytopathogenic bacteria were aligned by blastp against the p. syringae 1448a genome  <cit> . this search revealed that p. syringae 1448a contains gene clusters that are highly conserved  with the achromobactin biosynthetic locus of p. syringae pv. syringae b728a  <cit>  and the yersiniabactin biosynthetic locus of p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  <cit> .

to investigate the role of these gene clusters the p. syringae 1448a acsa  and hmwp <dig>  homologs were deleted in-frame from both wt and pvd- strains of p. syringae 1448a. on solid media both the achromobactin  and yersiniabactin  single mutants were indistinguishable in phenotype from wild type, growing effectively in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml eddha and rapidly taking up iron on cas agar. in contrast, a pvd-/acr- double mutant was unable to take up any discernible amounts of iron on cas agar irrespective of the duration or temperature of incubation . using silica chromatography as previously described  <cit>  we were able to isolate a siderophore from a culture of pvd- p. syringae 1448a grown to stationary phase in iron-limiting m <dig> minimal medium. when the fraction with the greatest siderophore activity  was analysed by maldi-tof, major peaks at m/z  <dig>  and  <dig>  were detected . the larger peak is consistent with the published mass for achromobactin of  <dig>  da  <cit> ; while the smaller peak most likely represents the same species following loss of a water molecule - when the same fraction was evaporated to dryness then resuspended in solvent prior to analysis, the relative intensity of the peak at m/z  <dig>  substantially increased.

surprisingly, despite appearing to have the genetic potential to make yersiniabactin, p. syringae 1448a does not appear to produce any high-affinity siderophores other than pyoverdine and achromobactin. we were unable to observe any secretion of yersiniabactin by the pvd-/acr- double mutant and a pvd-/acr-/ybt- triple mutant was indistinguishable from the pvd-/acr- double mutant in all phenotypic assays conducted in this work. to test whether laboratory passage of our p. syringae 1448a strain might have resulted in inactivation of the yersiniabactin genes by phase-shifting or another reversible mechanism, we repeatedly sub-cultured the pvd-/acr- double mutant in iron-limiting kb broth on a daily basis for  <dig> days, each day plating out a dilution that gave ca.  <dig> colonies on cas agar. duplicate plates were incubated at either 22°c or 28°c for up to  <dig> h, but no siderophore-secreting colonies were recovered. we therefore concluded that p. syringae 1448a produces only two high-affinity siderophores in response to iron deprivation, pyoverdine and achromobactin.

when each of the wt, pvd-, acr-, and pvd-/acr- strains were grown in liquid media and subjected to a modified cas assay that we developed to measure iron acquisition by factors secreted into the culture supernatant, the results were consistent with the phenotypes observed for each strain on cas agar . these results confirmed that p. syringae 1448a is able to employ achromobactin as a temperature-regulated secondary siderophore that is secreted into the extracellular environment for active uptake of iron; but also suggested that the presence of pyoverdine is able to mask any phenotypic effects due to achromobactin alone.

assessment of relative fitness of mutant strains under iron starvation conditions
to more precisely quantify the contribution of each siderophore under varying degrees of iron starvation, a serial dilution experiment was performed, employing eddha concentrations diluted 1: <dig> from  <dig> μg/ml down to  <dig>  μg/ml in kb media in a 96-well plate. the wt, pvd-, acr-, and pvd-/acr- strains were replica-inoculated into each well and incubated with shaking at 22°c for  <dig> h, following which culture turbidity was measured. ic <dig> values  were calculated for each of the strains using sigma plot. the ic <dig> for the wt  and acr-  strains were approximately equal, confirming that pyoverdine is able to compensate for achromobactin deficiency. in contrast the pvd- strain was sensitive to almost  <dig> orders of magnitude less eddha, with an ic <dig> of only  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml, demonstrating that achromobactin cannot completely compensate for the absence of pyoverdine. however, the ic <dig> for the pvd-/acr- double mutant strain  was reproducibly lower yet, verifying that in the absence of pyoverdine achromobactin still makes a small contribution to fitness during iron starvation. at 28°c the ic <dig> for wt and acr- strains were essentially unchanged, but the difference between the pvd- mutant  and pvd-/acr- double mutant  was less marked.

assessment of pathogenicity in phaseolus vulgaris
in order to assess the pathogenicity in the natural host of p. syringae 1448a each of the mutant strains  was subjected to the standard 'bean prick' pathogenicity test using bean pods  <cit> . all mutant strains were still able to cause characteristic water soaked lesions after inoculation and incubation in bean pods , irrespective of temperature and whether or not the beans were picked or still attached to the parental plant. this indicates that neither pyoverdine nor achromobactin is essential in enabling p. syringae 1448a to cause halo blight in the bean plant phaseolus vulgaris.

discussion
unlike p. aeruginosa, p. syringae does not appear to exhibit a high degree of variability in pyoverdine structure from strain to strain, with all fluorescent p. syringae pathovars tested thus far having been found to produce an identical pyoverdine molecule  <cit> . our bioinformatic studies suggested that p. syringae 1448a would not be any different in this regard; and maldi-tof and ms/ms analyses demonstrated that the same pyoverdine is indeed made by this strain. however, these analyses also indicated that p. syringae 1448a is able to make an additional pyoverdine variant that was fundamentally similar in most aspects, but with an overall mass  <dig> da greater.

the most plausible interpretation of the fragmentation pattern in figure 2c is that an extra monomer is incorporated into the pyoverdine side chain. if so, the b-ion pattern suggests that this monomer appears as the first residue of the side chain, falling between the chromophore and l-lysine, and increasing the mass by  <dig> da. the only amino acid which could give this mass increase is alanine . however, in silico analysis of all nrps modules present in the genome of p. syringae 1448a failed to reveal any a-domains predicted to specify alanine. one possibility may be that the variant pyoverdine species was generated as an artefact of the purification process through some unexplained mechanism; however, as the additional monomer clearly seems to fall between the chromophore and lysine residue rather than being added in a peripheral fashion, this explanation seems unlikely. an alternative explanation is that the product of p. syringae 1448a gene pspph <dig>  may possess a dual activity that enables occasional incorporation of an additional alanine residue. unfortunately we were unable to biochemically characterize the substrate specificity of this or any other of the pyoverdine nrps modules in in vitro assays - despite obtaining soluble protein by several different strategies, none of our purified proteins appeared to retain activity. this phenomenon is not uncommon for nrps enzymes. we note however that in ongoing work we have verified the second module of pspph <dig> is indeed a serine-activating nrps, as predicted by our in silico analysis ; when appropriate regions of this gene are swapped with the equivalent regions in module  <dig> of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> pvdd the substrate specificity of the recombinant gene product is converted from l-threonine  <cit>  to l-serine, and a correspondingly modified pyoverdine product is produced . it may be that we can employ a similar 'recombinant genetic characterization' strategy to interrogate the substrate specificity of pspph <dig>  however, for now the precise nature of the variant p. syringae 1448a pyoverdine species  remains unknown. although an equivalent species was not previously detected in studies of other p. syringae pathovars  <cit> , it is possible that these other pathovars also produce this form. as maldi-tof is not a quantitative technique the m/z  <dig> peak may actually be a very minor species that happens to ionize particularly well; and as the previous studies utilized an hplc preparative step to yield a single pure peak, this could conceivably have resulted in other minor peaks being missed. there is evidence from a previous isoelectric focusing analysis that different p. syringae pathovars produce minor variant isoforms of pyoverdine in addition to the major pyoverdine that is synthesized by all known fluorescent p. syringae isolates  <cit> . it is possible that the minor isoforms include variants that possess alternative side chain constituents as well as variants that have different acyl groups attached to the chromophore.

as per previous pyoverdine nrps gene knockouts in fluorescent pseudomonads  <cit> , in-frame deletion of any of the chromophore or side chain nrps genes in p. syringae 1448a resulted in complete abolition of pyoverdine synthesis. analysis of these mutants under iron-limiting conditions revealed the presence of a secondary siderophore, which was shown by genetic and biochemical analysis to be achromobactin. although p. syringae 1448a also appears to have the genetic potential to produce a third siderophore, yersiniabactin, our pvd-/acr- double mutant did not appear to be able to make this or any other siderophores, at least in response to iron limitation. our study does not rule out that yersiniabactin synthesis might be induced in p. syringae 1448a in planta, but this would contrast with yersiniabactin synthesis in p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  which occurs both in planta  <cit>  and under iron-limiting conditions in vitro  <cit> .

we observed that synthesis of achromobactin by our pvd- mutant was temperature sensitive. temperature regulation of siderophore production has been observed for other bacterial species  <cit>  and has been known to govern expression of other p. syringae genes, especially those implicated in causing disease  <cit> . achromobactin is known to contribute to virulence in d. dadantii  <cit> , and these observations prompted us to test whether it is a virulence factor in p. syringae 1448a also. the contribution of both achromobactin and pyoverdine to virulence of p. syringae 1448a during infection of phaseolus vulgaris was assessed by inoculation of mutant strains and wild type controls into the bean pods. all single and double mutants were still able to cause lesions in this standardized pathogenicity test, indicating that neither siderophore is required for p. syringae 1448a to cause halo blight in phaseolus vulgaris. these results were initially surprising to us, given that iron is essential for core metabolic processes, is believed to be severely restricted in the plant extracellular environment  <cit> , and that siderophores are generally regarded as important for microbial pathogenesis of both plant and animal hosts  <cit> . however, although the assumption is frequently made that pyoverdines are able to act as virulence factors in both animal and plant hosts, there is little experimental evidence for the latter. indeed, pyoverdine from p. syringae pv. syringae has likewise been shown not to have a determinative role in pathogenesis of sweet cherry fruit  <cit>  and more recently, pyoverdine in p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> has also been shown to be dispensable for pathogenesis  <cit> . it may be that phytotoxins render siderophores obsolete during the disease process by releasing iron from damaged plant cells into the extra-cellular environment. it should also be noted that the standard bean inoculation assay for p. syringae 1448a virulence monitors only the ability to cause lesions, which is dependent primarily on toxin release and may not accurately report on the full progression of disease. irrespective, it must be considered that any plant protection strategy which aims to target pyoverdine and/or achromobactin in p. syringae pv. phaseolicola will not prevent the appearance of economically-damaging halo blight lesions in bean crops.

despite the lack of evidence for an active role in lesion formation, our phenotypic analyses of iron uptake and growth under iron limiting conditions confirmed that siderophores are indeed important for fitness of p. syringae 1448a during iron starvation. although p. syringae has traditionally been defined as a phytopathogen, it is unclear how important pathogenicity really is to the survival of this bacterium in the wild  <cit> ; and it may be that the p. syringae 1448a siderophores are more important for epiphytic survival on leaf surfaces, in soil or water than during infection. however, given the clear superiority of pyoverdine as a siderophore, it is unclear why p. syringae 1448a makes achromobactin also. all of the fluorescent pseudomonas species known apart from one exception  synthesize at least one secondary siderophore and there is presumably some fitness benefit to be derived from this investment. there is evidence that secondary siderophores can have affinity for metals other than iron . the presence of orthologs of known nickel-transport genes immediately adjacent to the p. syringae 1448a achromobactin cluster in the p. syringae 1448a genome sequence  <cit>  may be indicative of a similar role in this bacterium . it has also recently been shown that both primary and secondary siderophores  can actually play defensive roles in sequestering toxic metals like aluminium, cobalt, copper and lead, which appears to protect bacteria against uptake of these metals by passive diffusion  <cit> . independent of a direct role in metal transport or sequestration, it has been suggested that secondary siderophores can also be involved in various signaling pathways  <cit> , or can have antimicrobial activities that are distinct from their iron scavenging properties  <cit> .

alternatively, dominique expert and co-workers have demonstrated that achromobactin in the phytopathogen d. dadantii is synthesized temporally before the primary nrps-derived siderophore chrysobactin  <cit> ; and have proposed that achromobactin in this bacterium may function as a provisional measure, enabling cells to respond more rapidly to fluctuations in iron availability while the slower chrysobactin system is established  <cit> . we suggest that a likely explanation for this scenario lies with the high energy investment required for activating nrps mechanisms of siderophore synthesis. nrps enzymes are amongst the largest known, with single proteins routinely exceeding  <dig> kda  <cit> . the energy requirements for a cell to synthesize such large proteins are substantial, and when already stressed this may represent a formidable barrier. however, once the nrps enzymatic template is in place then it is an extremely efficient method for synthesizing short peptides, consuming significantly less atp per peptide bond formed than ribosomal mechanisms  <cit> . it might therefore be useful to have a backup siderophore in place that can be expressed immediately in response to iron starvation and provide the cell with small amounts of iron while the nrps template for the more efficient primary siderophore is established. as the phenotypes of our mutant strains indicate that achromobactin is only important when pyoverdine is not available, it is possible that achromobactin likewise serves as a 'first response' siderophore to cope with a sudden onset of iron starvation in p. syringae 1448a. our investigation into the timing and regulation of pyoverdine and achromobactin synthesis in p. syringae 1448a is ongoing.

CONCLUSIONS
p. syringae 1448a appears to have the genetic capacity to produce three different siderophores however only two of these, pyoverdine and achromobactin, were detectable as active siderophores under the various conditions examined. an essential role for five nrps genes in pyoverdine synthesis was confirmed by gene deletion and complementation studies, and the in silico assignation of substrate specificity for each nrps module was found to be congruent with a structure for p. syringae 1448a pyoverdine inferred from ms/ms data. surprisingly, this data also indicated that p. syringae 1448a produces a second, heavier, isoform of pyoverdine, which may contain an extra alanine residue located between the chromophore and the lysine residue of the peptide side chain. although pyoverdine was shown to be a substantially more effective siderophore than achromobactin, neither siderophore was found to play a definitive role in the ability of p. syringae 1448a to cause halo blight, indicating that these siderophores are not promising targets for development of novel antibiotics to protect bean crops.
