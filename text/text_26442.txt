BACKGROUND
giardia intestinalis  is an intestinal protozoan parasite that colonizes the small intestine of humans and other mammals and it is a major cause of diarrhea worldwide. endemic outbreaks are common in low-resource settings, where infections are linked to malnutrition, mortality and growth retardation in children  <cit> . symptoms associated with the infection vary, from asymptomatic to severe, where diarrhea encompassed by vomiting, bloating, nausea and fatigue are common traits, and immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk of infection as well as clinical manifestation  <cit> .

g. intestinalis is divided into eight morphologically identical genotypes or assemblages . however, only a and b have been associated with human infections. assemblage a and b are further divided into sub-assemblages: ai, aii, aiii, biii, and biv  <cit> . despite extensive efforts to associate specific assemblages to symptoms, conflicting results have been obtained and there is to date no clear correlation between assemblage and symptoms. however, it has been reported that genotype ai is more frequently found in animals, whereas genotype aii is mainly found in humans  <cit> . certain assemblage a isolates have been connected to symptomatic giardia infections in humans  <cit>  and some have been suggested to have zoonotic potential  <cit> . however, most typing studies have used a limited panel of genes with low substitution rates, mainly due to the lack of genome data from other assemblages or subgroups.

the genomes of three isolates from the two human infecting assemblages  have been sequenced and analyzed  along that of the hoofed-animal infecting assemblage e  <cit> . the genome of g. intestinalis consists of  <dig> chromosomes, and sequencing efforts have shown the genome to be compact in terms of gene content and size; the haploid genome is ~ <dig> – <dig> mbp, with relatively little non-coding sequence compared to most eukaryotes  <cit> . untranslated regions of mrnas are relatively short  <cit>  and only a few genes have been shown to contain introns  <cit> . the variant-specific surface proteins  and the high cysteine membrane proteins  are two major, highly-variable, multi-gene families that are found in the genomes of g. intestinalis and are associated with antigenic variation and immune evasion  <cit> .

despite the relatively large divergence between assemblages a, b and e, comparative genomics have identified a conserved core of protein encoding genes   <cit> . analysis of the assemblage b genome  showed extensive allelic sequence heterozygosity  within the genome  <cit> , ash was lower in the aii isolate dh  whereas it was even lower in assemblage ai   <cit>  and e   <cit> . several bacterial-like assemblage-specific genes have been identified in the sequenced genomes, which are likely due to reflect recent lateral transfers from gut bacteria  <cit> .

the genome efforts that have been performed to date have increased the understanding of the genetic landscape of g. intestinalis, but the extent of diversity within each assemblage is less explored, and the chromosome-wide distribution of genetic diversity is still poorly defined. broadening the knowledge regarding genome-wide genetic diversity in pathogen biology is important in several aspects as it enables improvements in genotyping strategies, diagnostics and molecular epidemiology, and may reveal signatures that can relate to infectivity, pathogenesis and drug resistance. we have performed whole genome sequencing of two recently axenized g. intestinalis assemblage aii isolates with confirmed pathogenicity in humans, using the chromosome-level assembly of the g. intestinalis assemblage ai  genome sequence as reference, with the aim to characterize the amount of genetic diversity between the two human infecting sub-assemblages ai and aii.

RESULTS
clinical and biological data
two new assemblage aii isolates were individually isolated from two female patients in sweden that were infected in sweden  and india , respectively. the patients suffered from a wide range of typical giardiasis symptoms including; watery diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, and weight loss. initial genotyping of giardia cyst dna extracted from the infected patient fecal samples using beta-giardin , triose-phosphate isomerase  and glutamate dehydrogenase  typing showed that as <dig> had a multi-locus genotype  corresponding to mlg aii- <dig>  <cit>  and as <dig> had the aii- <dig> mlg. typing using assemblage-specific tpi primers  <cit>  showed small traces of assemblage b dna in the as <dig> sample whereas the as <dig> sample only contained assemblage a dna . mlg analysis of the two isolates after growth in vitro  showed the same mlg genotype  of the as <dig> isolate and exclusively mlg aii- <dig> in the as <dig> isolate.

the two isolates were axenized after in vitro excystation and several biological differences were identified when the isolates were grown in vitro. interestingly, the two new aii isolates grew faster in medium containing human serum compared to the standard medium with bovine serum where no or little growth was seen . the growth rate of as <dig> at optimal conditions was similar to the wb  isolate whereas as <dig> showed a slightly slower growth rate . the encystation efficiency of the aii isolates was comparable to the wb isolate, which is known as one of the best encysting isolates in vitro  <cit> . pulsed field electrophoresis analyses of the highly characterized assemblage ai isolate wb, compared to as <dig> and as <dig>  showed size differences in the smallest chromosomes . in wb, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have the same size  whereas the smallest chromosomes in as <dig> are  <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp in the as <dig> isolate. similar differences in chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> sizes between assemblage a isolates have previously been noticed and it was suggested to be due to recombination between telomeric rdna genes  <cit> . our sequencing data could not reveal the reason to the differences in chromosome size between the three a isolates but further analyses using long-read sequencing techniques like pacbio and optical mapping can resolve this issue.

genome assembly and isolate specific sequences
total dna was extracted from the two aii isolates after minimal growth time in vitro . this was done in order to reduce the risk for genomic changes due to in vitro growth. genomic dnas from the two isolates were individually sequenced using 454-sequencing . the average sequence coverage of the final assemblies were 8x  and 30x , see additional file  <dig>  the sequenced aii genomes were found to be sufficiently similar to the available genome sequence of assemblage ai  to allow a reference-guided mapping of the reads, using the chromosome-level assembly of isolate wb as a template. reads with more than one mapping location were removed to avoid bias caused by multi-mapping reads. the contig n50s were  <dig> and 57 kb for as <dig> and as <dig>  respectively. the number of sequence gaps was similar in both assemblies, and were on average 660 bp/gap, corresponding to  <dig>  and  <dig>  unmapped positions or about 88–9 % of the genome. regions that were not possible to cover, i.e. the gaps, were found to correlate to the more flexible part of the genome, which we have previously estimated to approximately 9 % of the genome  <cit> . the lower sequencing output of the as <dig> genome caused a slightly higher gap count in this assembly.

the core genomes of the three isolates were very similar and most sequence reads from the two aii genomes aligned well with the ai reference genome. a small number of high quality reads  did not align with the wb genome, and these were therefore assembled de novo , which resulted in a small number of short contigs . the gene content of these was analyzed, as these could contain isolate-specific sequences that are absent from the reference genome. among the identified genes were one rep <dig> viral-like replication protein, one dna polymerase and several hypothetical proteins with similarity to genes in the gs genome  <cit> . in total,  <dig> genes were found to be present in the two aii isolates but absent in the ai genome . one  <dig> aa hypothetical wb protein  was found missing in as <dig>  but a diverged homolog was found in the recently sequenced aii isolate dh and in as <dig> on one of the de novo assembled contigs. furthermore, one wb nek kinase  and one gene encoding an ankyrin-repeat protein  were found to lack syntenic orthologs in as <dig> and dh but not in as <dig>  one wb ankyrin repeat protein , a nek kinase  and one hypothetical  <dig> aa protein  were found to be missing in all three aii isolates. this data show that there are sub-assemblage specific proteins in giardia that potentially can be used for genotyping.

the coverage of each chromosome was inspected both manually and using automatic search tools, in order to identify putative segmental duplications or evidence of aneuploidy since chromosome size differences were detected in the pulse-field analysis. despite local variation in read depth, the distribution and size of the coverage peaks did not suggest any large structural duplications or aneuploidy . most read depth variation was attributed to artifacts related to the emulsion pcr, rather than actual genomic differences. however, certain regions appear with higher than average read depth, and with reads having different orientation and start/stop positions, in relation to what can be expected by artifacts alone. this likely indicates differences in gene copy number in the aii genomes. interestingly, most of these genes are typically found in the telomeric regions  <cit> . in as <dig>  genes with higher than average depth include; reverse transcriptase elements, vsp genes, ribosomal rna genes and one gene encoding the axoneme-associated protein gasp- <dig>  one multidrug resistance-associated protein  <dig>  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type  <dig> precursor. in as <dig>  similarly reverse transcriptase genes were found to have larger than average read depth, and one gene encoding an abc transporter and a multidrug resistance-associated protein. overall, these analyses support the earlier observation of chromosome size differences due to translocations in the telomeric regions.

analysis of multi-gene families
variant specific surface proteins  is a multi-gene family in giardia that is notoriously difficult to study, both using sequencing and by functional investigation  <cit> . the genome sequencing approach used here cannot completely reconstruct the genomic repertoire of these genes, neither using a reference assembly nor a de novo assembly strategy. to overcome this, we have quantified the relative amount of vsp-like sequences using a recently published alignment-free method  <cit> , see methods. this analysis shows that the vsp repertories of assemblage a isolates can be divided into two main clusters with the wb  vsps in one cluster and the vsps from the aii isolates in the other . within these clusters it is apparent that there are a few conserved vsps found in all three assemblage a genomes  but the majority of the vsp repertoires have evolved independently in the studied assemblage ai and aii isolates . a similar pattern was obvious in the smaller  and less variable hcmp gene family  <cit>  when compared using meme analysis . several hcmps are conserved between the isolates but isolate specific divergences have occurred. thus, the main mechanism of expansion in these two multi-gene families seem to be isolate-specific duplications of certain vsps and hcmps followed by divergence of the duplicated genes.fig.  <dig> analysis of vsp genes. vsp diversity in giardia intestinalis assemblage a isolates. black: wb , blue: as <dig>  and red: as <dig> . an alignment-free method was used to compare the vsp repertoires. the vsps from the three different assemblage a isolates form two major cluster with the ai vsps separated from the aii vsps



allelic sequence heterozygosity
the as <dig> and as <dig> assemblies contained an abundance of high quality mismatches between aligned reads. this has been identified in earlier giardia genome sequencing projects  and the mismatches represent heterozygous bases due to sequence differences between the four different genomic copies of the giardia genome, distributed in two nuclei  <cit> . in giardia this type of genomic variability has been named allelic sequence heterozygosity   <cit> . the amount of such putative ash in the as <dig> and as <dig> genomes was estimated by counting the number of high quality mismatches between aligned reads, as outlined in methods. this search identified a total of  <dig>  heterozygotic positions in as <dig> and  <dig>  in as <dig>  which yields an average percentage of heterozygosity  <dig>  % ash for as <dig> and  <dig>  % for as <dig>  this represents a 25– <dig> fold higher heterozygosity level than what was found in isolate wb  and p <dig> ,  <dig> fold higher than the dh isolate  but slightly less than what was found in gs .

the most common type of heterozygosity was found to contain two different bases. heterozygotic positions with three different bases were found only in  <dig>  and  <dig>  positions  and less than  <dig> positions had four different bases. about 80 % of the observed heterozygotic positions were transitions, consistent with the theory of nucleotide substitutions. in total, about 30 % of the heterozygosity was located in the core gene content, whereas the rest was present in either non-core genes such as vsps and hcmps or in non-coding sequence. however, since heterozygosity was also identified in core genes, this represents variation that potentially can give rise to an additional number of different protein isoforms, either at the population level or at the single cell level.

chromosomes-wide distribution plots indicated heterozygosity not to be homogeneous, rather high-density regions are intervened with regions devoid of ash , a pattern also observed in the gs  genome  <cit> . regions with a lower proportion of coding content coincide with regions with a high degree of ash and the presence of vsp and hcmp genes . higher coding content was in most cases found to correlate with the absence of, or very low levels of ash, as expected by the selective pressure in these regions, which allows them to accumulate less variation. the plots for the two aii genomes display almost over-lapping curves , indicating that regions prone to ash accumulation are similar, at least in these aii genomes. however, the intensity of peaks can differ even within the aii group, possibly reflecting local variation in ash accumulation . in most cases as <dig> have more intense peaks, but there are several exceptions where the peaks are more profound in as <dig> . the chromosome-wide plots further reveal that each chromosome has on average 20– <dig> regions with extensive ash accumulation. in giardia, chromosome  <dig> is the largest  and is more than  <dig> fold the size of chromosome  <dig>  and it also contains the largest amount of heterozygosity. furthermore, genomic regions longer than 100 kb are devoid of ash, rendering them as possible selective sweeps.fig.  <dig> putative allelic sequence heterozygosity. chromosome-wide distribution of putative allelic sequence heterozygosity . red lines represent ash in isolate as <dig>  and blue lines represent ash in isolate as <dig> . grey lines represents the inverted coding density, ie. more intense peaks represent less coding content and lower peaks represent higher coding content. dots indicate the approximate chromosomal location of vsp genes  and hcmp genes . regions with higher content of ash coincide with regions of lower coding content and often a vsp or hcmp gene. regions with high coding content tend to be more devoid of ash

genome-wide patterns of single nucleotide polymorphisms
we analyzed the patterns of single nucleotide polymorphisms  along the five giardia chromosomes plus several unassigned contigs using an in-house pipeline and a sliding window analysis, as shown in fig.  <dig>  the number of snps per sliding window were counted and plotted along the chromosomes, to identify regional variation in snp rates. as expected, both aii genomes resemble each other in terms of snps to ai. however, the aii genomes contain areas with divergence between each other, indicating sequence diversity on the sub-assemblage level . furthermore, between ai and aii, several regions on each chromosome have an elevated number of snps. frequently these regions were found to correlate with the location of vsps or hcmps and intergenic regions.fig.  <dig> chromosome-wide distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms. chromosome-wide distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms in 15 kb overlaping windows for each of the two isolates compared to wb. the blue lines represents the as <dig> isolate compared to wb and the black lines represent as <dig> compared to wb. the number of snps is shown on the y-axis and the chromosomal position on the x-axis



in total  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps were identified in the comparisons to the wb isolate, see table  <dig>  thus, between assemblage ai and aii there were on average 8– <dig> snps per 1000 bp. hence, the average sequence identity across ai and aii is >99 %, confirming previous estimations  <cit> . however, despite the fact that the number of identified snps compared to wb is similar for as <dig> and as <dig>  the aii isolates only share about  <dig>  snps, indicating diversity within the aii group and that population studies with new genotyping tools can reveal further substructure within this groups. the vast majority  of the identified snps were located in coding sequences, as expected due to the high coding density in giardia. about 32 % of the coding snps were found to be non-synonymous, and of these about 29 % were non-conservative amino acid changes dispersed in ~ <dig>  different genes.table  <dig> summary of sequenced data and diversity between assemblage ai and aii

to examine if any particular gene was undergoing positive selection, we searched for ortholog pairs between ai and aii with a dn/ds  >  <dig>  as expected, ω values were left skewed, indicating that most genes were under purifying selection. some  <dig> ortholog pairs were shown to have ω > <dig>  but the divergence was not found to be sufficient to determine if this is due to positive selection or drift. moreover, the average ω per chromosome was investigated, which showed chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to have almost identical values , but slightly elevated for  <dig> and  <dig> . this is possibly caused by the higher number of surface antigen genes that reside on these chromosomes as compared to the smaller chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

further, we examined the nucleotide diversity between assemblage ai and aii within protein encoding regions and a complete list of ortholog pairs and the calculated nucleotide diversity is provided in additional file  <dig>  molecular studies of clinical isolates have suggested that there are differences in virulence and zoonotic potential between different giardia assemblages  <cit> . assemblage a has been shown to be associated with zoonotic transmission  <cit>  and with acute diarrhea in humans  <cit> . differences in symptoms can be due to genetic differences in virulence factors so we investigated if any of the genes displaying high nucleotide diversity could be connected to virulence. several proteins with high nucleotide diversity are small  and specific for assemblage a. many have putative signal sequences and/or trans-membrane regions  and they localize in the same regions as variable genes like vsps, hcmps and nek kinases. nadph oxidoreductase  is involved in protection against reactive oxygen species in giardia  <cit> . over-expression of the enzyme in giardia reduces the sensitivity against oxygen  <cit> . the enzyme is also encoded by two other genes  and orf  <dig> also shows a high grade of nucleotide diversity between the assemblage a isolates and is up-regulated during host cell-interactions  <cit> . several hcmp proteins are up-regulated during host-parasite interactions in vitro and the three most highly up-regulated genes hcmp in wb  are among the genes with high level of nucleotide diversity within assemblage a. more detailed investigation of the genes and gene-families outlined above will likely provide new and important information that will aid in broadening the knowledge of virulence and potentially host specificity in g intestinalis.

characterization of the bactericidal permeability increasing  protein family
two wb proteins in the top  <dig> list of genes with high nucleotide diversity  are part of a small family of genes encoding proteins similar to bactericidal permeability increasing protein . bpi proteins are highly expressed in neutrophils and they have antibacterial activity, mainly against gram negatives due to their lps binding activity  <cit> . the giardia bpi-like proteins  are  <dig> aa proteins with signal peptides and structure predictions suggest that they fold into the typical boomerang-shape of bpi . a phylogenetic analysis of the bpil proteins in the giardia isolates wb , gs , dh , p <dig>  and the mouse parasite giardia muris  showed that the genes have evolved independently in the different species/assemblages . however, there are two main clusters with the two quickly diverging wb bpils in each cluster . the bpil genes localize to flexible regions of the genome that contain vsps, hcmps and nek kinases, which can explain the high level of sequence divergence. expression analyses using rna sequencing data showed that all genes are expressed in trophozoites of the wb, gs, p <dig> and as <dig> isolates grown in vitro  <cit> . epitope tagging and immunolocalization of the bpil proteins in the wb isolate showed that they all localize to the er . further qualitative studies are necessary in order to determine the exact function of the bpil protein family in giardia. from a microbial ecology standpoint it would be intriguing if the bpils share similarity with the bpis found in neutrophils, as this would give giardia a competitive niche in the intestine of its host, and could potentially provide new avenues of research on the topic of microbial interactions.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of bacteriocidal and permeability inducing-like  proteins in giardia. amino acid maximum likelihood phylogeny based on  <dig> unambiguously aligned amino acid positions. the sequences are color coded according to isolates: g. intestinalis wb , g. intestinalis dh , g. intestinalis gs , g. intestinalis p <dig> , and g. muris . bootstrap support values > <dig> are shown. the tree is rooted on the branch leading to g. muris

discussion
in this study we axenized two new g. intestinalis assemblage a isolates  from symptomatic human patients, performed a set of comparative phenotypic analyses, sequenced and compared their genomes. axenization of g. intestinalis from patient stool samples is known to be a difficult task, however certain assemblages and sub-assemblages appear to be better adapted to currently published protocols. in our hands, the establishment of aii isolates in vitro, was dependent on supplementing 10 % human serum to the growth medium instead of the usual 10 % bovine serum. this indicates that species-specific serum factors may be necessary in order to establish in vitro growth of certain giardia isolates that are more host-adapted. the use of serum from the particular host where the parasites are isolated could be a relatively simple method to improve the frequency of axenization. the two, freshly axenized, g. intestinalis aii isolates showed similar in vitro growth rates as the reference wb  isolate, after minimal adaptation to in vitro conditions, indicating that assemblage a may generally be more easily adaptable compared to the other human infecting assemblage b, which has proven difficult to adapt in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, after successful axenization of the aii strains, they also showed similar in vitro encystation rates as wb. efficient encystation of two other anexic assemblage ai isolates was recently shown  <cit>  but to date, efficient in vitro encystation of assemblage b parasites has not been possible in standard encystation medium  <cit> , further highlightning the phenotypic differences found between g. intestinalis assemblages and sub-assemblages. improved strategies to further evaluate the impact of modified culture conditions upon in vitro excystation and axenization, would be highly informative in light of elucidating the range of host specificity among the g. intestinalis assemblages and sub-assemblages.

comparison of chromosome size between the two clinical assemblage aii strains and the reference strain wb , indicate difference in size of the small chromosomes,  <dig> and  <dig>  previous studies have suggested these differences to be due to recombination of regions of rdna in the telomeres  <cit> . many pathogenic protozoan parasites, e.g. plasmodium falciparum and trypanosoma brucei have high densities of variable surface proteins in the telomeric regions  <cit> . the telomeric location is important for regulation of gene-expression and in the generation of new gene variants via recombination and gene conversion  <cit> . the wb isolate have variable surface proteins spread over the chromosomes but the density is higher close to the telomeres  <cit> . however, not much is known about the regulation of these genes since the so far sequenced giardia genomes lack complete telomeric regions. further genome characterizations of giardia isolates using techniques that can generate assemblies of full length chromosomes, including the telomeric regions, will make it possible to study if chromosome size differences is also related to vsp expression and/or pathogenesis.

we studied the genome-wide variations between g. intestinalis sub-assemblage ai and aii and found that the two sub-assemblages are 99 % identical, or expressed in number of nucleotide differences,  <dig> snps per 1000 bp or around  <dig>  snps in total. this gives clear evidence that ai and aii represent two distinct evolutionary lineages of g. intestinalis with several ai- and aii-specific gene variants that can potentially reflect local adaptations. from multi-locus genotyping of clinical isolates it has been suggested that ai is a more homogeneous group as compared to aii  <cit> . recent proteomic analyses of two ai isolates from australia, b- <dig> and h- <dig>  using the wb genome as reference confirmed the low level of divergence in the ai sub-assemblage  <cit> . this is also supported by results from genomic comparisons between the two ai isolates wb and portland- <dig>  combined with our findings of genetic polymorphisms between as <dig> and as <dig> . we found that nucleotide differences or snps are dispersed along the chromosomes, but with local fluctuations in snp density, reflecting either strong selective forces or the lack thereof. dense snp regions were frequently found in non-coding regions or in regions with variable surface proteins, suggesting that random mutations accumulate in these regions.

the level of ash in the aii isolates  is similar to the ash in assemblage b isolate gs   <cit> . this was unexpected, since it has previously been reported that assemblage a isolates have a low level of ash   <cit> . genetic exchange in giardia has been extensively discussed, but to date there is no direct evidence for this process, although some reports have suggested that recombination might occur between giardia isolates . the degree of genetic heterozygosity  in any to date sequenced giardia isolate do not support the idea of frequent large scale genetic exchange in this organism, especially not between assemblages  <cit> . multi-locus typing based on a limited number of genes is the most common method to discriminate between giardia assemblages  <cit> . in our earlier studies using multi-locus genotyping with three genetic markers on  <dig> human giardia isolates from swedish giardiasis patients we noticed that different alleles are combined into different combinations in the different assemblage b isolates  <cit> , suggesting recombination between assemblage b isolates. in order to identify recombination within assemblage a one would need to use more variable genetic loci that are conserved in all assemblage a isolates. this type of typing will be possible to develop now when more genomic data exists from the assemblage a group. as the cost of sequencing continues to decrease and giardia genome sequencing can be done without axenization  <cit>  future efforts might target a larger panel of ai and aii genomes in order to exploit the genome-wide diversity rather than a few genes to identify further assemblage substructure. thus, the level of recombination within and between assemblages but also associations between genotype and symptoms might be possible to resolve in the future. however, already now the combined data suggest that assemblage a and b are actually two different giardia species  <cit> .

for the first time we have identified a set of orthologous genes in assemblage a that show large sequence divergence between different assemblage a isolates . the majority of genes are hypothetical proteins but some have homology to nadph oxidoreductases, bpils and cysteine proteases that have earlier been suggested to be important during host-parasite interactions  <cit> . future detailed studies of each protein will show what roles they have during giardia infections. the genes with high levels of sequence divergence can often be found in the variable regions of the giardia genomes containing vsps and hcmps and these regions  make up most of the genetic differences between different giardia isolates. future studies of the giardia “variome” using long-read sequencing techniques can generate more complete giardia genomes. these variable regions of the giardia genomes can in turn be used in molecular typing, diagnostics and epidemiology, and can reveal molecular signatures, which may relate to infectivity, pathogenesis and drug resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome of g. intestinalis is modular with highly conserved core regions mixed up by variable regions containing high levels of snps and cysteine rich membrane proteins. genomes of different assemblage a isolates vary significantly, in terms of gene content, cysteine rich membrane protein repertoire and gene polymorphisms. the large genetic differences within one assemblage of g. intestinalis strengthen the argument that the assemblages represent different giardia species.
