BACKGROUND
faba bean  is an important temperate legume, grown for human consumption and animal feed due to its high protein and fibre content  <cit> . the crop also replaces available nitrogen in the soil when used in rotation with cereals and oilseeds, and thus is expected to be a highly beneficial component in future temperate low carbon agricultural systems. china is the largest faba bean producer  with an average dry grain production  of  <dig> , <dig> metric tonnes  from  <dig>  hectares; followed by ethiopia , france , egypt  and australia   <cit> .

however, faba bean suffers from several major biotic and abiotic factors that constrain productivity. although significant genetic gain to overcome these has been made through traditional breeding practices  <cit> , progress through the use of genomics and associated biotechnologies is limited. this is due mainly to the large genome size , which is approximately  <dig> times larger than that of the model legume medicago truncatula, and  <dig>  times larger than pisum sativum <cit> , together with a lack of financial investment in this crop species.

recent advances in next generation sequencing  technologies enable the generation of large volumes of sequence efficiently and cost-effectively  <cit> . this has led to a revolution in biological and agricultural applications including identification of genes correlated with key breeding traits through high-density snp marker and genome-wide association analysis studies   <cit> . another outcome is the ability to accurately identify sequences flanking simple sequence repeat  regions for use as locus-specific markers for downstream genotyping. otherwise known as microsatellites, ssrs are tandemly repeated motifs of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides found in both coding and non-coding regions  <cit> . these have become a marker of choice in many genotyping applications due to their relatively high abundance, high level of allelic variation, co-dominant inheritance, analytical simplicity and transferability of results across laboratories  <cit> .

a limited number of characterized ssr loci  which have been validated over relatively few genetic backgrounds are available for faba bean. initially, pozarkova et al. developed primers to  <dig> ssr loci detected in chromosome  <dig> dna libraries  <cit> . subsequently, zeid et al. developed primers to  <dig> ssr loci  <cit>  and gong et al. developed  <dig> est-ssr loci primers  <cit> . most recently, est sequences within the public domain databases were screened and an additional  <dig> novel ssr loci were characterized and validated among  <dig> faba bean accessions  <cit> .

besides providing a cost-effective valuable source for molecular marker generation, the identification of ssr within ests is an effective approach for gene discovery and transcript pattern characterization, particularly if through mapping an est-ssr or est marker is significantly associated with a qtl  <cit> . this may be achieved by searching for ssr associated sequences within est of a well characterised crop or model plant species. together with the advantage of in silico analysis, this approach has the potential to substantially broaden the field of comparative studies to species where limited or no sequence information is available.

the present study identified high-quality putative ssr loci and flanking primer sequences cheaply and efficiently using the roche  <dig> gs flx titanium platform. the resultant ssr sequences were characterized and validated through successful amplification of randomly selected target loci across a selection of faba bean genotypes from diverse geographic origin.

methods
plant material
a total of  <dig> faba bean accessions were selected from the national genebank of china held at the institute of crop science , chinese academy of agricultural sciences , beijing. of these,  <dig> originated from china,  <dig> were from other asian countries,  <dig> were from europe,  <dig> were from africa,  <dig> were from the america,  <dig> breeding lines were sourced from the icarda  faba bean breeding program and one was from oceania .

dna isolation, library preparation and  <dig> sequencing
seven days after seed were left on moist filter paper in the dark at 22°c, sprouts from each of the  <dig> genotypes were collected. a single sprout of each genotype and of approximately the same weight was pooled and total gdna was extracted using the ctab method  <cit> .

genome libraries were constructed using eight biotin labeled probes and a selective hybridization with streptavidin coated bead method  <cit> . the probes were: pga, pac, paat, paac, paag, patgt, pgata and paaat. the quality of libraries was inspected by randomly selecting and sequencing  <dig> clones. the cloning vector was peasy-t <dig> , and the primers used for sequencing were f: 5′-gtaaaacgacggccagt-3′ and r: 5′-caggaaacagctatgac-3′. libraries were considered to be of high quality if the length of sequences were from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, as evidenced on agarose gel.

subsequently, entire libraries were equally pooled and subjected to  <dig> sequencing with gs-flx titanium reagents at beijing autolab biotechnology co., ltd . all processing and analyses of the sequencing data was performed with gs-flx software v <dig> . <dig> . using a series of normalization, correction and quality-filtering algorithms, the  <dig> sequencing data were processed to screen and filter for weak signals and low-quality reads, and to trim the read ends for  <dig> adaptor sequences using the emboss  <cit>  software package. the sequencing data were then submitted to the ′national center for biotechnology information  short read archive and given the accession number srp <dig> 

ssr loci search and primer design
the software misa  tool  was configured to locate a minimum of  <dig> bp: monomers , 2-mers , 3-mers , 4-mers , 5-mers  and 6-mers . this tool allowed the identification and localization of perfect microsatellites as well as compound microsatellites. the maximum size of interruption allowed between two different ssr in a compound sequence was  <dig> bp. subsequently, primer  <dig>   was used to design primer pairs to the flanking sequences of each unique ssr.

ssr characterization and validation
the number of different types of ssr, length  and ssr position was searched and analyzed for using a bespoke program written in misa files  <cit>  and plotted by openoffice.org calc.

marker assessment
polymerase chain reactions  were performed in  <dig> μl reaction volumes containing  <dig>  u of taq dna polymerase ,  <dig> × pcr bufferii,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> μm of dntp,  <dig>  μm primer, and  <dig> ng of genomic dna. microsatellite loci were amplified on a heijingang thermal cycler  with the following cycle:  <dig> min initial denaturation at 95°c;  <dig> cycles of 30s at 95°c, 30s at the optimized annealing temperature , 45s of elongation at 72°c, and a final extension at 72°c for 10min. pcr products were initially assessed for size polymorphism on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver nitrate staining.


the genotyping data was subsequently used to determine genetic relationships among  <dig> v. faba accessions . the number of alleles , expected  heterozygosities and observed  heterozygosities were calculated using popgen <dig>   <cit> . the cluster analysis of  <dig> genotypes was carried out based on nei's unbiased measures of genetic distance  <cit>  by using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average , and the dendrogram was drawn by mega <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
quality inspection of the dna library
the recombination rate within the constructed ssr-enriched v. faba library was  <dig> %. among the  <dig> clones sequenced,  <dig> % contained ssr sequences within an insert that ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb in size.

 <dig> sequencing and characterization reads
a total of  <dig>  reads were generated from the pooled library, and  <dig>  read sequences were used for further analysis after adaptor removal. adenine was the most abundant nucleotide , followed by thymine , guanine  and cytosine . the mean gc content was 43%. the average length of read sequence was  <dig> bp, with a maximum length of  <dig> bp .


identification of ssr loci
after misa analysis, the number of sequences containing an ssr was  <dig> , and in total  <dig>  ssr loci were detected. the number of sequences containing more than one ssr loci was  <dig>  and the number of ssrs present in compound formation was  <dig>  .

the total size of ssr motif sequences was  <dig> , <dig> bp, with an average motif length of  <dig> bp. of these, 25% comprised more than one discrete repeat and a high proportion  was located within compound repeats. the majority of identified ssr motifs  were located between the 5’-terminus and mid regions of the cloned sequences, and within  <dig> bp of the 5’-terminus . a total of  <dig>  primer pairs were designed for future assessment of locus amplification .

.

abundance and length frequencies of ssr repeat motifs
the most common ssr motifs comprised trinucleotide and dinucleotide repeats . the majority of the trinucleotide repeats were from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length. within the  <dig>  characterised mononucleotide ssr, n was almost three times more common than n, particularly at the 11– <dig> bp length. the dinucleotide repeats n and n were predominant, representing  <dig> % of all of the dinucleotides characterised. triucleotide n repeats were the most abundant . twenty two unique tetranucleotide repeat motifs were identified, with the most common being agat/atct , acag/ctgt  and acat/atgt . pentanucleotide and hexanucleotide motifs were far less frequent, together comprising only  <dig> % of the total ssr detected. the dominant pentanucelotide motif was agagt/atctc  and the most common hexanucelotide motif was acacgc/cgtgtg  .

.

compound ssr analysis
two types of compound ssr were identified; those without an interruption between two motifs  <dig> and noted as c* type) and those with an interruption between two motifs 7gtcaat <dig> and noted as c type). in total,  <dig>  c* type and  <dig>  c type compound ssr loci were detected among those sequenced, reflecting the complexity of the faba bean genome.

validation of ssr assay
of the  <dig> primer pairs selected for validation of ssr locus amplification,  <dig> produced a reproducible and clear amplicon of the expected size. of these,  <dig>  were polymorphic among thirty-two genotypes assessed . the number of alleles per locus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  the expected heterozygosities ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the observed heterozygosities ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .


notes: number of alleles , expected heterozygosity  and observed heterozygosity .

the dendrogram showed that the  <dig> faba bean genotypes fell into four distinct clusters . cluster  <dig> comprised accessions from china and other asian countries except for one accessions from africa. cluster  <dig> comprised accessions from europe and nearby regions such as syria. cluster  <dig> comprised accessions from africa and cluster  <dig> contained accessions from america, oceania and africa. the pattern of diversity was similar to that previously observed using aflp  <cit>  and issr  <cit>  markers.

discussion
this study demonstrated that massively parallel sequencing technology offers opportunity to quickly identify large numbers of high quality ssr with diverse motifs from a genetically orphaned species such as vicia faba. given the huge number of marker loci identified in this study, future ssr marker optimisation may be best focussed on those comprising trinucleotide repeats. these repeats are generally more robust since they are reported to give fewer “stutter bands” than those based on dinucleotide repeats  <cit> . also, trinucleotide repeats in particular have been demonstrated to be highly polymorphic and stably inherited in the human genome  <cit> . while the tri- and dinucleotide repeats mostly contributed to the major proportion of ssrs, a very small share was contributed by mono-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeats. a similar trend was observed in other species  <cit> .

the conversion of ssr-containing sequences into single locus markers may have a low success rate due to complex and/or insufficient flanking sequence. for example, just 20% of the identified dinucleotide repeats from spruce were converted to clear, discrete markers  <cit> . similar observations were made for pine  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and previously for v. faba <cit> . another factor affecting the development of clear markers is the complexity of the repeat motifs, indeed a high proportion of the ssr in the current study comprised compound repeats . nevertheless, this study has provided the selected data required to potentially develop tens of thousands of novel ssr markers for the faba bean genome.

previously, a total of  <dig>  reads were generated and  <dig> est-ssr primer pairs were designed from transcriptome sequencing of faba bean  <cit> . from this,  <dig> primer pairs were developed, of which 48% produced polymorphic markers on the genotypes assessed. in our study, 68%  of the ssr loci identified were accurately amplified, of which 63%  were polymorphic among the genotypes tested. this may be indicatative of the larger number of ssr loci detected, inclusive of non-transcribed sequences. hence these markers may be more representative of the entire genome for the purposes of germplasm diversity assessment and conservation purposes  <cit> . meanwhile, the identification of est-ssr within sequences provides future opportunity to mine the expressed sequences for significant physical and functional association with traits of interest in marker-assisted faba bean breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
this work represents a major advance in the identification of large numbers of informative ssr loci in v. faba by application of  <dig> gs flx titanium sequencing technology.
