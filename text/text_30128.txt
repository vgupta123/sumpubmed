BACKGROUND
phloem translocation is driven by hydrostatic pressure gradients between source and sink tissues. many plants utilize phloem loading, the energized accumulation of photoassimilate in the collection phloem, to establish the high hydrostatic pressure, but pressure must also be maintained along the transport phloem for effective transport from source to sink tissues. establishing and maintaining phloem pressure is therefore central to plant growth, and the concentrations of the major osmotically active solutes  are closely regulated .

in most plants, sucrose is the predominant osmolyte in the phloem and is accumulated by suc/h+ symporters  <cit> . suc/h+ symporters form a small gene family  in all species studied  <cit> . group  <dig> family members, including atsuc <dig> from arabidopsis and solanaceae sut <dig> orthologs, are most prominently involved in phloem transport among dicots, whereas group  <dig> family members catalyze phloem loading in monocots  <cit> . these genes are developmentally and environmentally regulated to control the accumulation of sugar in the phloem. as examples, atsuc <dig> induction in the minor veins follows the sink to source transition of developing leaves and requires light  <cit> ; solanaceae sut <dig> genes are diurnally regulated  <cit> ; and bvsut <dig> is repressed in the phloem of beta vulgaris  leaves by sucrose fed into the apoplast, indicating sucrose signaling  <cit> . at the level of post-transcriptional regulation, suc/h+ symporters undergo rapid turnover  <cit>  and are regulated by phosphorylation cascades  <cit> , indicating that activity can be quickly altered. in addition, protein interactions between zea mays  sut <dig> and proteins encoded by tie-dyed <dig> and tie-dyed <dig> are hypothesized to promote/regulate sucrose transport under high light intensity  <cit> .

a physiological trigger regulating sucrose accumulation appears to be phloem hydrostatic  pressure  <cit> . for example, bathing a test system in hypertonic solutions of sorbitol to draw water out of cells and reduce pressure enhances sucrose uptake and acidification of the bathing solution, suggesting that both sucrose symporter and atpase activity are stimulated  <cit> . turgor-regulated suc/h+ symporter activity in the phloem is consistent with findings that drought stress sufficient to affect photosynthesis has relatively little effect on translocation, since osmotic adjustment maintains pressure and transport  <cit> . in arabidopsis, microarray experiments show modest increases  in atsuc <dig> expression in response to drought, abscisic acid , or turgor stimulation  <cit> . also, more effective sucrose transport during drought is implicated as an effective drought tolerance mechanism in drought resistant cultivars of phaseolus vulgaris   <cit> . in addition to sucrose, other solutes may accumulate during osmotic adjustment. in response to salt stress, for example, two phloem-specific polyol transporters increase expression in plantago major, and the sorbitol to sucrose ratio in phloem exudates increases  <cit> .

the role of atsuc <dig> and solanaceae sut <dig> orthologs has been examined through highly informative, but relatively crude, mutation  <cit> , suppression  <cit>  and overexpression  <cit>  studies. more recently, atsuc <dig> gene activity was spatially restricted to the collection phloem to isolate its role in phloem loading from its role in long-distance transport, with the conclusion that during long-distance transport, it functions in retrieval from lateral tissues and not efflux to lateral tissues  <cit> . the extent to which the "fine-tuning" of symporter gene expression in response to environmental conditions contributes to plant growth and photoassimilate partitioning is not, however, addressed. the objective of this study was to drive atsuc <dig> expression from different phloem-specific promoters in an atsuc <dig> mutant background to establish whether exotic promoters can substitute for genomic sequences, because exotic phloem-specific promoters are unlikely to share identical patterns of expression. commelina yellow mottle virus  infects the monocot commelina diffusa but contains a dna element that confers strong, companion cell-specific expression to diverse species  <cit> , and the rolc promoter from agrobacterium rhizogenes is commonly cited as phloem specific  <cit> . our results show that the strong coymv promoter adequately substitutes for the genomic atsuc <dig> promoter, but that the weaker rolc promoter results in stunted growth and starch accumulation in the lamina of mature leaves. the potential for enhancing phloem transport or osmotic adjustment by expressing sugar-proton symporters from foreign or synthetic promoters is discussed.

methods
plasmid construction
plasmid constructions were by standard procedures  <cit>  using escherichia coli xl1-blue  as the host strain. restriction endonucleases were from new england biolabs , oligonucleotides were obtained from invitrogen , and pfui ultra dna polymerase  was used for pcr. all clones incorporating a pcr product were sequenced . the starting material for new plasmids was pgem::cmgas1p::csuc <dig> and pgem::suc2p::csuc <dig>  <cit> . the commelina yellow mottle virus promoter  from pco <dig> bam  <cit>  was digested with psti and kpni and ligated into the same sites of pgem::cmgas1p::csuc <dig> to create pgem::coymvp::csuc <dig>  the rolc promoter from pbin19::rolc  <cit>  was digested with ecori, made blunt with klenow, digested with kpni, and ligated with pgem::atsuc2p::csuc <dig> digested with sali  and kpni to create pgem::rolcp::csuc <dig>  these promoter::csuc <dig> cassettes where then subcloned into pgptv-bar  <cit> , as is or as fusions with gfp and uida, and electroporated into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain gv3101mp <dig> as described  <cit> .

plant material
wild type col- <dig> and seeds of t-dna insertional mutagenesis lines salk_ <dig>  salk_ <dig> and salk_ <dig> were obtained through the arabidopsis biological resource center  <cit> . plant growth and genotyping were as described  <cit> . heterozygous plants  were transformed by floral dip  <cit> . t <dig> generation seeds were sown on sun gro metro-mix  <dig>  in  <dig>  inch square pots , stratified for  <dig> hours, germinated in a controlled-environment chamber , and transgenic seedlings were selected by spray application of glufosinate ammonium  for seven consecutive days. resistant plants were genotyped as wild type , heterozygous , or homozygous mutant  by pcr with the red extract-n-amp plant pcr kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions, and using previously described oligonucleotides and pcr conditions  <cit> . twelve or more lines independently transformed with the atsuc <dig> cdna constructs and segregating atsuc <dig> -/- at the genomic locus were obtained from either the t <dig> or t <dig> generation.

for growth analysis, seed from col- <dig>  atsuc <dig> +/-, and atsuc <dig> -/- plants, and from the  <dig> independent lines for each construct  were germinated in individual cells of a 36-cell flat . plants were photographed  <dig> days post germination, just before the transition to flowering such that all aerial growth was represented in the rosettes. rosette surface area  was measured with imagej version  <dig> ×  <cit> . for root measurements, representative lines were germinated on vertically oriented, square petri plates containing murashige and skoog medium with gamborg vitamins , solidified with  <dig> g l- <dig> gellan gum  and measured with a ruler  <dig> days post germination. xglca staining in plants transformed with uida constructs was performed on  <dig> day-old whole plants using  <dig> mm potassium ferri- and ferrocyanide to limit diffusion of β-glucuronidase reaction products  <cit> .

to measure transcript abundance, rosettes were harvested two week after germination to obtain two pools of approximately  <dig> mg for each line, except salk_ <dig> atsuc <dig> -/-, for which two pools of  <dig> mg were obtained. isolation of total rna, synthesis of cdna with random hexamer primers, and semi-quantitative pcr, using oligonucleotides ubq <dig> and ubq <dig>  and atsuc2ex3ex4f and suc2-3-orf, to amplify ubq <dig> and suc <dig> transcripts, respectively, were as previously described  <cit> .

carbohydrate analysis and radiolabeling
major soluble sugars and starch were measured in the leaves and petioles of representative lines. plants were grown for  <dig> days, and the first three adult leaves from siblings  were excised at the stem and the fresh weight of lamina samples  and petioles measured; plants were processed between five and six hours after the beginning of the light period. analysis of sugars and starch was previously described  <cit> .

for -suc and -sorbitol uptake studies, intact rosettes of 14-day-old plants were harvested by cutting the hypocotyls, fresh weight was established, and plants were submersed in mes buffer  plus  <dig> mm cacl <dig> to prevent drying while other plants were processed. all material was harvested between six and eight hours of the illuminated period. rosettes from each line were divided among three scintillation vials containing  <dig> ml fresh mes buffer with cacl <dig>  supplemented with either -suc or -sorbitol , and weighted down with  <dig> mm glass beads. each replicate generally contained two or three pooled plants to obtain between  <dig> and  <dig> mg of intact rosettes, except salk_ <dig> atsuc <dig> -/-, which contained six to eight pooled plants to obtain  <dig> to  <dig> mg of rosette. the leaves were vacuum infiltrated for  <dig> min and incubated at room temperature with gentle agitation on a rotary shaker for  <dig> min, followed by three, 15-min washes in fresh buffer without labeled sugar. for each line, two of the infiltrated replicates were first cleared with  <dig> ml of 95% ethanol for  <dig> hour, and then bleached with  <dig> ml commercial bleach overnight. five ml of scintillation fluid was added and  uptake expressed as cpm - <dig>  plants in the third replicate were gently blotted dry after washing, placed between sheets of filter paper, and frozen in powdered dry ice. frozen rosettes were lyophilized in a -30°c chamber for  <dig> h, pressed flat between steel plates in a large vice and exposed to x-ray film  for  <dig> h. measurement of phloem exudation from radiolabeled leaves was as previously described  <cit> .

RESULTS
atsuc <dig> mutants and growth habit of complemented lines
three arabidopsis mutants with t-dna insertions at the atsuc <dig> locus were previously described  <cit> . one of these  contained a t-dna insert in the first exon, and the other two  each had an insert at different locations in the second intron. all three had the same phenotype: severe stunting, accumulation of starch and anthocyanin in leaves, delayed flowering, and failure to produce viable seed; all three were considered knockout mutations  <cit> . two additional insertion mutants were recently characterized  <cit> . the insert in salk_ <dig> is downstream of the atsuc <dig> open reading frame and does not result in a visual phenotype. the insert in salk_ <dig> is in a unique site of the second intron , and in the homozygous condition , shows a phenotype similar to that described by gottwald et al.,   <cit> . salk_ <dig> was further characterized for the presence of atsuc <dig> transcript. sequences from the third and fourth exons were not detected by semi-quantitative pcr, supporting the conclusion that salk_ <dig> harbors a null mutation  <cit> . based on this analysis, salk_ <dig> is suitable for probing the function of atsuc <dig> in whole-plant carbon partitioning by complementation with genes that have altered activity or expression pattern.

to test the ability of exotic promoters to drive atsuc <dig> expression and distribute photoassimilate throughout the plant, atsuc <dig> cdna  was fused to the rolc promoter from agrobacterium rhizogenes   <cit> , the promoter element from commelina yellow mottle virus   <cit> , and  <dig> kb of the atsuc <dig> promoter sequence  as a positive control  <cit>  . the stop codon of csuc <dig> was flanked with xmai and saci restriction endonuclease recognition sites to create in-frame fusions with gfp or uida .

binary vectors carrying the csuc <dig> cassettes were transformed into heterozygous atsuc <dig> +/- plants because homozygous salk_ <dig>  plants are unsuitable for floral dip transformation. transgenic progeny harboring these constructs were selected with glufosinate ammonium, and genotyped for segregation at the genomic locus as atsuc <dig> +/+, atsuc <dig> +/-, or atsuc <dig> -/-. for each csuc <dig> construct,  <dig> independently transformed lines were identified that were atsuc <dig> -/- and, based on a 3: <dig> ratio of resistance:sensitivity to glufonisate ammonia in the subsequent generation, had the cdna cassettes inserted at a single site. tandem copies are possible.

the independent transformants demonstrated a range of growth, presumably reflecting differing levels of csuc <dig> cdna expression. growth of eight independent lines for each construct is presented in fig. 2a to show the range of complementation obtained. those marked  were homozygous for the cdna based on 100% resistance to glufosinate ammonia among seedlings . the remainder had sensitive seedlings, showing they were still segregating for the cdna in the generation used , and the plants measured may have been hemizygous or homozygous for the transgene. those harboring the promoter::csuc2::uida cassettes demonstrated poor growth, indicating that the β-glucuronidase fusion compromised atsuc <dig> activity, but performed slightly better than the atsuc <dig> -/- parent line , implying some activity in planta. β-glucuronidase activity was not compromised, however, and these lines confirmed the expression patterns conferred by the promoters. growth of plants with the promoter::csuc::gfp cassettes was intermediate between csuc <dig> plants and csuc2::uida plants , suggesting that atsuc <dig> is somewhat tolerant of fusions proteins, but these gfp constructs were still not suited for complementation assays and were not pursued.

the average rosette area for the four most robust suc2p::csuc <dig> transformants was not significantly different from heterozygous plants   <cit> . from these four robust lines that most closely mimicked wild type growth, a single line that was homozygous for the transgene was selected as a representative line for further study . two weeks after germination, csuc <dig> transcript abundance in whole rosettes of line  <dig> plants, relative to ubq <dig> transcript as an internal standard  <cit> , was very similar to that observed in atsuc <dig> +/+ plants . three weeks after germination, rosette growth in line  <dig> was not significantly different from atsuc <dig> +/+ or atsuc <dig> +/- plants . root growth in line  <dig> was not significantly different from wild type roots  <dig> days after germination on sterile ms media with 0% suc . a representative suc2p::csuc2::uida leaf stained with xglca is shown in fig. 2j, demonstrating staining only in the vascular tissue of mature leaves. in immature leaves, the staining pattern was characteristic of the sink-to-source transition, as previously described  <cit> . none of the  <dig> suc2p::csuc2::uida lines analyzed deviated from this pattern .

rosette growth of the four most robust atsuc <dig> -/- lines harboring coymvp::csuc <dig> was similarly not significantly different from heterozygous plants . to be consistent in selecting representative lines, a single line homozygous for the coymvp::csuc <dig> transgene was selected for further study from these four most robust lines . transcript abundance of csuc <dig> was greater in line  <dig> than atsuc <dig> abundance in atsuc <dig> +/+ plants two weeks after germination . however, rosette growth was slightly reduced relative to atsuc <dig> +/+ plants but was not significantly different from atsuc <dig> +/- plants three weeks after germination . root growth was marginally less than wild type on sterile ms media with 0% sucrose . the coymv promoter is specific for companion cells   <cit>  and a representative xglca staining pattern is shown in fig 2k. none of the  <dig> independent lines deviated from this pattern. comparison of xglca staining in the coymvp::csuc2::uida lines, relative to suc2p::csuc2::uida, qualitatively supports the semi-quantitative rt-pcr results showing that coymvp is stronger than suc2p.

the rosettes of the four most robust atsuc <dig> -/- lines complemented with rolcp::csuc <dig> were smaller than heterozygous plants , and from these, a representative line was selected for further study . transcript abundance of csuc <dig> in this line was reduced relative atsuc <dig> transcript in atsuc <dig> +/+ plants two weeks after germination , and rosettes were significantly smaller than both atsuc <dig> +/+ or atsuc <dig> +/- rosettes three weeks after germination . root growth was also reduced . qualitative xglca staining in  <dig> independent lines harboring rolcp::csuc2::uida suggested that rolcp is less strong than the suc2p and coymvp, but that the pattern is vein specific .

transient carbohydrate distribution in the leaf
suc is the predominant transport sugar in arabidopsis  <cit> , and when activity of atsuc <dig>  is reduced, soluble sugars and starch accumulate  <cit> . to assess the effect of the different promoters on carbon partitioning, the distribution of the major forms of transport and storage carbohydrate were analyzed in the lamina and petiole of representative lines. wild type,  <dig> , and  <dig>  plants did not show different levels of glc, fru, or suc in the lamina or the petiole , as expected from their similar growth. starch similarly showed no difference in the petiole samples, but in the lamina, starch was slightly elevated in  <dig> plants and reduced in  <dig> plants. soluble sugars and starch were elevated in both the lamina and petiole of the rolcp::csuc <dig> line .

sugar and starch in the lamina  and petiole of the indicated plant lines after  <dig> days of growth. the first three mature leaves from each plant were pooled for extraction, and variation  calculated from n =  <dig> to  <dig> sibling plants. sugars levels are expressed as nmoles per milligram fresh weight, and starch is expressed as glucose equivalents.

loading and transport of -suc
to analyze suc uptake in transgenic and control plants, rosettes were excised from the plant and infiltrated with a buffered solution of -suc and incubated for  <dig> minutes. after thorough washing, two replicates were subjected to scintillation counting to quantify uptake , and a third replicate was subjected to autoradiography to identify sites of  accumulation . leaves from wild type controls  and from the representative atsuc -/- lines,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  accumulated  to similar levels, irrespective of differences in suc <dig> transcript abundance, growth, and transient carbohydrate levels . in addition, all showed label accumulation in the veins and clearing from interveinal tissues  of mature leaves . label was distributed throughout the lamina of small sink leaves, and midsize leaves demonstrated vein labeling in distal portions and diffuse labeling in proximal regions of the leaves. the size and labeling pattern of these leaves strongly suggests that they are transition leaves, with distal regions loading and exporting sugar as source tissue, and proximal regions importing nutrients as sink tissue.

homozygous salk_ <dig> plants , however, did not accumulate -suc in a similar fashion .  accumulation, relative to rosette fresh weight, was reduced in whole rosettes . in autoradiography images , enhanced signal was evident in sink leaves, and sink portions and hydathodes of transition leaves but not in the veins of mature source leaves. we considered that the small size of the atsuc <dig> -/- plants may have compromised -suc entry during vacuum infiltration or removal during washes, and a second experiment was conducted using -sorbitol as an "inert" sugar . if sugar entry and washing was independent of growth habit, then -sorbitol retention per mg fresh weight was expected to be equal across all lines. -sorbitol retention was however greater in atsuc <dig> -/- plants , suggesting non-specific retention in the atsuc <dig> -/- plants is greater than the other lines. -suc accumulation is expressed relative to -sorbitol retention in figure 4c, and emphasizes reduced suc uptake in the atsuc <dig> -/- line. arabidopsis has at least one broad-specificity transporter that can use sorbitol as a substrate, but its physiological function is not clear and appears to be limited  <cit> . we cannot exclude the possibility of an increase in catalyzed sorbitol uptake in atsuc <dig> -/- plants.

to assess the efficiency of photoassimilate transport out of the leaf via the phloem, excised leaves were photosynthetically labeled with 14co <dig>  and phloem sap was collected over  <dig> hours by an edta exudation method. at the end of the exudation experiment, the amount of isotope exuded from the leaves was determined relative to the amount retained by the leaves in soluble and insoluble fractions . leaves of wild type,  <dig>  and  <dig> plants had similar distributions of label in the collected exudates and in both the soluble and insoluble fraction in the leaf. leaves from rolc::csuc <dig> plants , however, exuded less label and retained more in the leaf soluble fraction  consistent with this line having reduced levels of csuc <dig> transcript , reduced growth , and elevated levels of soluble sugar in leaves . all lines had equivalent levels of label in the insoluble fraction. this is not surprising since the exudation experiment was conducted over  <dig> hours in a humidity chamber under ambient room lighting to minimize edta entry into the leaf  <cit> . under these low-light conditions, and over this period of time, any 14c initially incorporated into starch during the period of photosynthetic labeling  was likely converted back into soluble sugars.

percentage of 14c-photosynthate exuded from cut petioles and retained in the leaf  <dig> hours after photosynthetic labeling with 14co <dig>  four mature leaves from each of four replicate plants were arranged in a  <dig> well microtiter plate and photosynthetically labeled for  <dig> minutes with 14co <dig> in a sealed chamber three feet below a  <dig> w metal halide bulb. exudation into  <dig> mm edta proceeded for  <dig> hours under ambient room light, and the edta solutions were changed and counted at the indicated time points.

discussion
phloem loading is the thermodynamically unfavorable accumulation of solutes into the phloem  <cit> . the term refers to the accumulation of solute, principally sugars, into the minor vein phloem of mature leaves to accentuate the pressure gradients between source and sink tissues  <cit> . phloem loading is a dynamic process that helps coordinate source capacity with sink demand. in plants that load suc from the apoplast, expression of the necessary suc/h+ symporter genes are regulated by development, light, diurnal cycles, sucrose signaling and response to turgor  <cit> . however the phloem also accumulates photoassimilate and other solutes during osmotic adjustment in response to changes in plant water status , and there is significant mechanistic overlap in the two processes. early studies proposed that phloem turgor pressure was a principal regulator of both phloem loading for transport and solute accumulation for osmoregulation  <cit>  and this is still an important component of more current models .

the objective of this study was to assess the ability of exotic phloem-specific promoters to substitute for the genomic atsuc <dig> promoter in driving the expression of the atsuc <dig> gene and promoting carbon distribution throughout the plant. experiments were done in a line with a t-dna insertion in the second intron of atsuc <dig>  <cit>  that had a phenotype consistent with three previously described t-dna insertion mutants  <cit> . the t-dna insertion greatly reduced transcript levels and deleted exons  <dig> and  <dig> from transcripts that were present  <cit> . we show in this work that -suc does not accumulate in mature leaves , further arguing that this is a null mutation. -suc accumulation observed in sink tissues is likely mediated by one of the other family members  <cit> . using this line, we recently showed that a promoter which confines expression to the companion cells of minor veins  was sufficient to restore suc transport to atsuc <dig> -/- plants  <cit> . in these experiments, the phloem-loading function of atsuc <dig> was restored but functions in the transport phloem were not. plant growth and carbohydrate distribution argued that atsuc <dig> in the transport phloem is likely involved in suc retrieval from the apoplast, and not efflux to the apoplast, but that even this retrieval function plays a relatively minor role in arabidopsis growth and development  <cit> .

the phloem-specific expression pattern for each promoter used in the current work has been described  <cit> , but confirmation  is important for accurate interpretation of the results. fusions between atsuc <dig> cdna and uida or gfp did not restore satisfactory growth to mutant plants, but xglca staining in twelve independent lines for each promoter had the expected expression pattern . based on these results and previous characterization, there is no reason to suspect that any of the transgenes deviate from the expected expression patterns. although atsuc <dig> has been fused to reporter genes previously, and it was shown that fusions alter the cellular distribution of the protein  <cit> , these studies were not carried out in a mutant background, and the activity of the fusion proteins was not gauged. this is the first effort demonstrating that fusions compromise symporter activity in planta.

two kb of atsuc <dig> upstream sequence was used as a positive control promoter. two kb confers the same expression pattern as  <dig> kb, and gives strong phloem-specific expression consistent with the sink-to-source transition and the onset of phloem loading  <cit> . by expressing csuc <dig> from this sequence in a mutant background, we functionally confirm that  <dig> kb is sufficient for effective phloem transport and robust growth. line  <dig>  had modestly elevated starch levels. growth – although not significantly different from wild type – more closely resembled atsuc +/- plants. furthermore, csuc <dig> transcript abundance was equivalent to that for atsuc <dig> transcript in atsuc <dig> +/+ plants. characterizing more independent transgenic lines may resolve this discrepancy in growth, but it is also possible that the low levels of truncated transcript or protein  from the mutated gene may be interacting negatively with the transcript or protein from the cdna transgene  <cit> .

the experimental promoters, rolcp and coymvp, are similar to suc2p in that both are active throughout the phloem and follow the sink-to-source transition  <cit> . coymvp is characterized as strong and companion cell specific  <cit> . in this work, we show that coymvp in line  <dig> confers stronger expression than suc2p, and plants expressing csuc <dig> from this promoter showed robust growth and carbon partitioning. however, it is noteworthy that despite stronger suc <dig> gene expression, line  <dig> did not demonstrate enhanced growth but rather a modest reduction, and alterations in transient carbohydrate distribution and suc loading and transport were not significant or very slight under laboratory conditions. this supports previous findings that suc/h+ symporter activity is regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally  <cit> .

the expression pattern conferred by the rolc promoter is not as rigorously analyzed, but it has been used extensively for phloem specific expression . in our hands, rolcp was not as strong as either suc2p or coymvp, as determined by semi-quantitative rt-pcr and qualitative xglca staining, and this was reflected in reduced growth and the accumulation of soluble sugars and starch in lamina and petioles. surprisingly, rolcp is activated by exogenous suc, such that as suc levels increase in the leaf, symporter expression should also have increased to promote transport  <cit> . our findings that coymvp provides higher expression levels than rolcp is supported by previous findings  <cit> .

both rolcp and coymvp are from plant pathogens, agrobacterium rhizogenes and a badnavirus that infects the monocot commelina diffusa, respectively, and the results reported here suggest that phloem specificity and high levels of expression are sufficient for atsuc <dig>  to mediate suc loading and transport under laboratory conditions. however, although both promoters have presumably evolved phloem expression to favor interaction with their plant hosts, it is unlikely that their expression patterns are subject to the same regulatory cascades as symporters involved in phloem loading. for example, the rolc promoter is specifically activated by exogenous sucrose in tobacco  <cit>  but the bvsut <dig> promoter is specifically repressed by exogenous sucrose in sugar beet  <cit> . we are unaware of reports on coymvp regulation by sugar signaling or environmental simuli. furthermore, solanaceous sut <dig> protein was recently localized to xylem parenchyma cells, suggesting a role in transporting suc to transient storage reserves  <cit> , but similar localization of rolcp and coymvp expression is not reported, and previous sequence comparisons did not identify similar sequences between these and other phloem-specific promoters  <cit> .

the regulatory cascades that govern solute accumulation in the phloem evolved to ensure plant survival in natural environments, and these may not be optimal in domesticated crops where yield of harvested organs is the primary concern. as examples, suc/h+ symporters are subject to diurnal regulation in the solanaceae  <cit> , are repressed by high suc levels in sugar beet  <cit> , and require a co-factor in maize under conditions of high light and suc accumulation  <cit> . each of these may contribute to balancing sink-source relations or may have protective roles but may also prevent available carbon from reaching harvested sinks. although not addressed directly in this study, exotic or engineered promoters that do not reduce expression under these conditions may help maintain high levels of phloem transport and consequently contribute to increased productivity. furthermore, since suc accumulation is important for phloem osmotic adjustment, increasing the expression of suc/h+ symporters during drought may enhance stress avoidance.

CONCLUSIONS
solute accumulation in the phloem is a dynamic process that helps coordinate the needs of sink tissues with the output capacity of source tissues, and through osmotic adjustment, maintains phloem hydrostatic pressure during changes in plant water balance. sucrose uptake and the activity of the predominant phloem suc/h+ symporter is regulated by numerous physiological and environmental stimuli, including leaf development, light, diurnal cycles, sugar signaling, and turgor. despite this, exotic phloem specific promoters driving expression of atsuc <dig> cdna are sufficient to restore sucrose partitioning in atsuc <dig> mutant plants to various extents. because the endogenous suc/h+ expression pattern may be sub-optimal for maximal carbon partitioning in new environments, the use of exotic or synthetic promoters to manipulate symporter gene expression and phloem loading may increase yield or osmotic stress tolerance.
