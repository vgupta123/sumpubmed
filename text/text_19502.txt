BACKGROUND
due to its well annotated genome sequence, newly established gene transfer systems, and the availability of high-quality tools for obtaining and evaluating transcriptomic and proteomic data, aspergillus niger has become a model fungus for industrially exploited filamentous fungi  <cit> . its impressive natural capacity to secrete high amounts of hydrolytic proteins into the environment combined with its ability to synthesize and secrete various organic acids makes it highly suitable for the production of various food ingredients, pharmaceuticals, and industrial enzymes  <cit> . as it is also capable of efficiently degrading plant-derived polysaccharides such as starch, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and inulin, the biotechnological importance of a. niger will probably rise even more in the near future. for example, a. niger-derived cellulases might be used to improve the efficiency of the saccharification process of second-generation feedstock used for bioethanol production  <cit> .

to analyze and eventually control the secretory capabilities of a. niger, several attempts have been undertaken to identify the key players and regulatory mechanisms involved in protein secretion. for example, galacturonic acid, xylose, and maltose were shown to induce expression of secretory proteins, including pectinolytic, cellulolytic and glucan-hydrolyzing enzymes, respectively, whereas sorbitol acts as a repressing carbon source  <cit> . xylose is the main inducer of xlnr, the master transcription factor that regulates expression of all major enzymes involved in the degradation of cellulose  <cit> . among those, endoxylanase  and ferulic acid esterase  are the most abundant, secreted proteins of a. niger <cit> . when starch or maltose are used as carbon source, the synthesis of amylolytic enzymes is induced, a step that is mediated by the transcription factor amyr. the most abundant enzyme secreted under these conditions is a glucan  <dig> -α-glucosidase , which is an exo-enzyme that releases glucose from the non-reducing end of starch or maltose and accounts for more than 50% of the extracellular proteome  <cit> . induction of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes is thus mainly regulated at the transcriptional level in a. niger, and either repressed by carbon catabolite repression via crea  <cit>  or activated by amyr or xlnr depending on the presence of maltose or xylose, respectively  <cit> .

a. niger proteins and enzymes destined for secretion into the culture medium follow the secretory pathway. the journey of secretory proteins starts with protein translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum  via a translocon that forms a channel through the er membrane  <cit> . in the er lumen, several er-resident chaperones and foldases, including the binding protein , protein disulfide isomerase , and calnexin , assist secretory proteins in proper folding  <cit> . most secretory proteins become glycosylated in the er, both through the attachment of a conserved, pre-assembled oligosaccharide to specific asparagine residues  and by the initiation of o-glycosylation of serine and threonine residues. after proper folding and glycosylation, secretory proteins are packed into copii-coated vesicles and transported to the golgi complex, where protein glycosylation is completed, and subsequently through another vesicle-mediated process delivered to the cell surface where the vesicles release their cargo into the periplasmic region. high protein flux through the er or expression of heterologous proteins can result in the accumulation of misfolded proteins. this misfolding, however, is recognized by a quality control system known as er-associated degradation . the aim of erad is to direct misfolded proteins to the cytosol where they become degraded by the proteasome. in addition, another cellular protein quality system, the unfolded protein response , is induced, which aims at proper refolding of misfolded proteins via induced expression of chaperones and foldases  <cit> . for this purpose, the upr transcription factor haca becomes activated via splicing of an unconventional 20-nt intron out of the haca mrna. this subsequently facilitates translation of haca mrna and formation of haca, which in turn induces transcription of a number of upr target genes including bipa, which encodes the major er chaperone protein, and pdia, which encodes for protein disulfide isomerase  <cit> . hence, both erad and upr are crucial for effective functioning of the secretory pathway - not only in filamentous fungi but also in yeasts and mammals  <cit> .

interestingly, the upr can be viewed as a general response of a. niger, which becomes activated when the secretion machinery becomes challenged by metabolic changes or er stress conditions. for example, transcript levels of upr genes become strongly enhanced, when a. niger is exposed to the reducing compound dithiothreitol , which blocks the formation of disulfide bridges, or to tunicamycin, which inhibits n-glycosylation, especially when forced to express heterologous proteins or when cultivated in carbon sources, which differentially induce expression and secretion of homologous proteins  <cit> . these observations suggest that the upr functions as a homeostatic control mechanism that allows a. niger to flexibly adapt its protein secretion capacity to change in environmental conditions.

in this study, we investigated the transcriptomic fingerprint of a. niger when forced to overexpress and secrete a specific hydrolytic enzyme. we chose glucoamylase  as a model enzyme, because it is a naturally highly abundant and secreted enzyme used in the food industry  <cit> . for comparison, we used two strains, a wild-type strain expressing a single copy of the glaa gene, and a mutant strain expressing multiple copies of glaa. in order to reduce the number of conflicting variables, such as changes in growth rates and fluctuations in environmental conditions, maltose-limited chemostat cultures were used. maltose was selected as a carbon source to transcriptionally induce expression of the glaa gene. physiological and transcriptomic data were collected from both wild-type and overexpressing strains and analyzed to identify the glaa-specific overexpression transcriptome. finally, we compared these global transcriptional changes with previously published transcriptomic data related to secretion stress in a. niger. this analysis allowed us to distinguish condition-specific responses from general transcriptomic responses of a. niger that are important to overcome different triggers of secretion stress. we could identify a core set of  <dig> genes whose expression is key to ensure high protein fluxes through the secretory route of a. niger, independently of the cause of the secretion stress.

RESULTS
growth physiology of maltose-limited chemostat cultures of a. niger
in order to identify the transcriptomic adaptations of a. niger to forced overproduction of glaa, we compared the transcriptomes of chemostat-grown cultures of strain b <dig>  and wild-type strain n <dig> . strain b <dig> was selected as glaa overproducer, because it is reported to contain multiple copies of the glaa gene at chromosome v  <cit> .

maltose-limited chemostat cultures were used to induce expression of the glaa gene, to control the specific growth rate and to obtain highly reproducible data due to well-defined steady state conditions. initial chemostat experiments were conducted using three different dilution rates ; however, steady state conditions for both strains were only reached at d =  <dig>  h- <dig>  at a higher dilution rate , n <dig> reached a steady state, but the b <dig> strain was washed out before reaching a steady state. although the morphology of the n <dig> strain at the lowest dilution rate  was similar to the higher dilution rates, and no sign of mycelial aggregation was apparent , n <dig> was not able to reach a steady state at this dilution rate. maltose-limited chemostat cultures were therefore run in triplicate at d =  <dig>  h- <dig> for both strains. the cultures were highly reproducible and gave rise to homogenous cultures of dispersed mycelial morphologies . the initial batch cultivation  was followed by approximately  <dig> h of continuous cultivation. after four volume changes , the cultures reached a steady state as reflected by a constant alkali addition rate and constant co <dig>  o <dig>  and biomass concentrations . biomass concentrations for both strains stabilized at about  <dig> g kg- <dig> with a small relative standard deviation  . in both strains, the respiratory quotient  was lower than  <dig>  probably due to high production of organic acids in parallel to glaa secretion. notably, the rq value calculated for b <dig> cultures was slightly but significantly lower than the rq value obtained for n <dig> cultures , suggesting that protein and acid production is somewhat higher in b <dig> compared to n <dig>  in agreement, the carbon concentration in culture filtrates obtained from steady state samples was also higher in b <dig> compared to n <dig>  and the specific productivity of extracellular protein  was five- to six-fold higher in b <dig> than n <dig>  demonstrating that b <dig> indeed secretes more protein than the wild-type strain.

protein secretion and glucoamylase production during steady state
the glaa overproducer strain b <dig> was previously estimated to contain about  <dig> copies of the glaa gene as inferred from southern analysis  <cit> . as multiple gene copies can cause frequent recombination in a. niger resulting in genetic instability and loss of glaa copies  <cit> , we decided to re-determine the number of glaa copies present in b <dig> using quantitative real time pcr . as summarized in table  <dig>  b <dig> contains about  <dig> glaa gene copies based on the fact that n <dig> contains only a single copy of glaa <cit> . we also determined glaa mrna levels by qpcr and observed that glaa transcript levels in b <dig> were about seven times higher compared to n <dig>  consistent with this observation, under steady state conditions extracellular glaa production in b <dig> was about seven- to eight-fold higher than in n <dig> as estimated by western analysis and measuring glucoamylase activity . these data confirm previous observations that the amount of glaa produced correlates well with the amount of glaa mrna but is not proportional to the number of glaa gene copies, a well-known phenomenon in filamentous fungi, where protein overproduction is often limited at the transcriptional level  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that the increased glucoamylase production in the b <dig> strain is still significantly lower compared to industrial strains which produce glucoamylase up to  <dig> gram/liter  <cit> .

glucoamylase was assessed using steady-state samples. mean values ± standard deviations for n <dig> and b <dig> were calculated from triplicate measurements of respective triplicate steady-state samples. aglucoamylase gene copy number and relative glucoamylase transcripts level were assessed by qpcr using genomic dna and cdna as templates. bwestern blot analysis of glucoamylase protein. culture filtrate samples corrected for equal amounts of biomass were loaded onto sds-page. the amount of glucoamylase protein was represented as relative values based on n <dig>  cglucoamylase activity was determined by measuring liberated glucose from starch.

the glaa-overexpression transcriptome
rna samples for microarray analysis were taken from triplicate steady-state cultures of both strains. the average rsd of all genes expressed was about  <dig> , indicating high reproducibility of all six chemostat cultures and transcript profiles. the expression of  <dig>  genes out of  <dig>  a. niger genes was changed:  <dig> displayed increased expression levels in the strain b <dig>  and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in b <dig> . although the majority of differentially expressed genes  showed fold-changes in gene expression < <dig>  these values are considered to be significant in view of the identical culture conditions used, the identical specific growth rates of both strains during steady state conditions, and the stringent statistical analysis of the data. a comprehensive list of all differentially expressed genes is depicted in additional file  <dig> 

an enrichment analysis was performed to identify gene ontology  terms which were over-represented in the differentially expressed gene set. we used the recently published improved go annotation tool for a. niger , an open source tool accessible at http://www.broadinstitute.org/fetgoat/index.html. go terms  with fdr values <  <dig>  were defined as over-represented. overall,  <dig> enriched go terms were identified among the differentially expressed gene set,  <dig> of which belonged to ‘biological processes’ ,  <dig> to ‘cellular components’  and  <dig> to ‘molecular functions’ . the corresponding network maps and gene lists are depicted in the additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

predicted up- and down-regulated biological processes inferred from the glaa-overexpression transcriptome
in order to deduce biological information out of the go term enrichment analysis, we focused on the bp gene list and removed redundant and less detailed annotations. among the remaining go terms in the up-regulated gene set, the following four higher-order categories were identified: i) translocation, ii) protein glycosylation, iii) vesicle transport, and iv) ion homeostasis . the translocation category included go terms such as ‘posttranslational protein targeting to membrane’, ‘srp-dependent co-translational protein targeting to membrane’, ‘translocation’, and ‘protein targeting to er’. the protein glycosylation category included the go terms ‘related to glycosylation’, ‘protein n-linked glycosylation’, ‘oligosaccharide biosynthetic process’, ‘dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthetic process’, and ‘oligosaccharide-lipid intermediate biosynthetic process’. the vesicle transport category included the go terms ‘vesicle-mediated transport’, ‘copii-coated vesicle budding’, ‘membrane budding’, ‘vesicle organization’, ‘vesicle coating’, ‘vesicle targeting ’, ‘copii vesicle coating’, and ‘retrograde vesicle-mediated transport ’. the last category, ion homeostasis, contained go terms involved in iron, calcium, and zinc homeostasis .

as three out of the four major categories were related to the secretory pathway, the corresponding genes lists were examined in more detail. the expression of at least  <dig> predicted secretory pathway genes were changed in the glaa-overexpressing strain b <dig> . importantly, this set of genes is causatively linked to glaa overexpression and does not depend on the growth rate or the carbon source, because both strains were in steady state at the same specific growth rate in maltose-limited chemostat cultures. only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were down-regulated, indicating that the capacity of the protein secretion machinery is increased compared to the wild-type situation. among the secretory pathway-related genes, the majority of the induced genes belonged to er-related processes, including translocation into the er, protein folding, glycosylation, erad, upr, and copi- and copii-mediated transport processes . notably, the gene with the most significantly increased transcript level in b <dig> was the bipa gene , which is under transcriptional control of haca  <cit> , and encodes the main chaperone in the er and is thus important for protein overproduction in a. niger <cit> . the increased expression of bipa gene in the b <dig> strain was previously reported by northern blot analysis in a shake flask culture  <cit> . in agreement, other important haca-dependent er chaperones and foldases such as clxa, prpa, tiga, and pdia  were also significantly higher expressed in b <dig>  <cit> .

dsm code: orf identifier in a. niger cbs  <dig>  genome sequence  <cit> . genes in bold are also found in maltose/xylose transcriptomic comparison  <cit> . * indicates genes that were also identified in strains with constitutively active hacaca <cit> .

as up-regulation of these genes pointed towards slow or aberrant folding of glaa and thus induction of upr in strain b <dig>  we tested whether the central activation mechanism of upr, the stress-induced splicing of haca mrna and thus increased expression of haca target genes  <cit> , was induced in strain b <dig>  the ratio of spliced to unspliced haca mrna was indeed considerably higher in strain b <dig> , demonstrating that forced overexpression of glaa provokes er stress, leading to an upr in order to ensure proper folding and secretion of glaa. figure 2b shows that this response is appropriate and sufficient for a. niger, because strain b <dig> is better adapted to grow on starch compared to the wild-type strain. interestingly, starch- and maltose-responsive genes such as the transcription factor amyr and amyr-dependent hydrolase genes  <cit>  are down regulated in b <dig> except glaa . as previously suggested, a possible explanation for the reduced expression could be the titration of the amyr transcription factor due to the high number of glaa promoter copies in this strain  <cit> . alternatively, the biosynthesis of an inducer through one of the enzymes under control of amyr might be reduced. lower inducer levels could then lead to lower levels of active amyr transcription factor, leading to a negative feedback loop. down-regulation of amyr targets  could also be explained by the ress  phenomenon, described for trichoderma reesei <cit>  and arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , and predicted for a. niger <cit> . ress is a transcriptional feedback mechanism that is activated in response to impairment of protein folding or transport and aims at lowering the protein load in the secretory route when er stress conditions are sensed  <cit> . as we have observed that glaa overexpression induces a mild upr , we propose that down-regulation of amyr and its target genes reflects a negative feedback mechanism similar to ress in t. reesei.

*fold difference in glaa is under-estimated due to the saturation of array signals. transcript level of glaa in b <dig> was about 7-fold higher than n <dig> based on qpcr results.

notably, enriched go terms of the ‘ion homeostasis’ category indicated an increased demand for iron, calcium, and zinc. in the context of increased fluxes of glaa through the secretory pathway in strain b <dig>  several explanations are conceivable. first, the mature glaa protein contains nine cysteine residues, eight of which are involved in disulfide bridge formation  <cit> . hence, in b <dig> there is an increased demand for disulfide bond formation, which requires increased activity of protein disulfide isomerases. increased amounts of pdia, however, might result in sequestration of zinc ions in the er  <cit> , thus preventing it from binding to other proteins and causing a cellular shortage of zinc. second, chaperones such as clxa needs calcium as co-factor  <cit> , hence enhanced expression of clxa in b <dig> calls for higher calcium concentrations in the er. third, calcium is of general importance for vesicle fusions and the function of the er and golgi  <cit> . hence, the cells have to mobilize calcium from internal or external stores to ensure higher fluxes through the secretory pathway in b <dig>  finally, the activity of glaa is known to be positively affected by the presence of mn2+, ca2+, and fe2+ ions  <cit> , which are also required for many other protein activities including heme or iron-sulfur-cluster  proteins  <cit> . in this context, it is interesting to note that protein secretion in a. fumigatus has most recently been shown to require controlled uptake of iron. basically, the transcription factor prtt not only positively regulates expression of protease genes but also strengthens expression of iron uptake genes  <cit> . we thus compared the published expression data of iron uptake genes in a. fumigatus  with the expression data of their predicted orthologs in a. niger . twelve out of  <dig> iron-uptake genes showed similar expression profiles , i.e. their up-regulation in wt versus Δprtt was mirrored in b <dig> versus n <dig>  in agreement, expression profiles of the main iron transcription factors also matched, i.e. up-regulation/down-regulation of the activator hapx/repressor srea in wt versus Δprtt were comparably up-/down-regulated in b <dig> versus n <dig>  hence, both independent observations from two aspergilli strongly indicate that proper function of the protein secretion machinery and high fluxes through the secretory pathway mandate optimal iron supply and assuring proper ion homeostasis.

go enrichment analysis of the down-regulated gene set in b <dig> uncovered three major categories: i) ‘carbon catabolism’, ii) ‘amino acid catabolism’, and iii) ‘response to oxidative stress’ . the first two categories might be causatively linked to the ress phenomenon discussed above, i.e. increased glaa secretion is only possible at the cost of other secreted proteins. as amyr targets related to starch degradation are down-regulated in b <dig> , processes related to polysaccharide degradation have consequently to be down-regulated as well. in a recent study,  <dig> proteases of a. niger were identified in the extracellular medium, when the strain was cultivated under sorbitol-, galacturonic acid- or carbon-starvation conditions  <cit> . expression of  <dig> of them was reduced in b <dig> compared to n <dig>  two of the genes were up-regulated and expression of five genes was unaltered . hence, overall reduction in protease activity in b <dig> will in turn decelerate amino acid catabolic processes. an additional explanation for reduced expression of carbon and amino acid catabolic processes is that many enzymes involved in these processes are iron-dependent. iron deficiency has been shown to trigger a metabolic response in saccharomyces cerevisiae or schizosaccharomyces pombe, which includes down-regulation of enzymes involved in carbon and amino acid metabolism and respiration  <cit> . assuming that this also holds true for a. niger, reduction in catabolic processes would lower the fluxes into the citric acid cycle and into the respiratory chain, which in turn would also lower the amount of radical oxygen species produced. hence, oxidative stress would be diminished, which in turn would result in down-regulation of oxidative stress genes as observed in b <dig>  a slight but significantly reduced rq in b <dig> compared to n <dig>  supports this hypothesis. taken together, the enriched go term set of down-regulated genes in b <dig> can hypothetically be viewed as a consequence of the ress phenomenon and reduced iron availability due to increased glaa secretion.

two a. niger proteins lacking an n-terminal signal peptide for entering the secretory route were recently determined to be abundantly present in the secretome of a. niger <cit> . it was thus proposed that proteins can also be exported out of the cell by the so-called non-classical secretion pathway  <cit> . interestingly, transcript levels of both protein-encoding genes were lowered in b <dig> versus n <dig> . this could mean that an accelerated activity of the classical secretory machinery is only possible at the expense of the non-classical secretion pathway – which could be another potential example for the existence of the ress regulatory feedback loop in a. niger.

comparison of the glaa overexpression transcriptome with the maltose transcriptome
in order to identify genes whose transcript levels are generally important for high-level secretion in a. niger, i.e. independent of the conditional trigger, we compared the glaa transcriptomic fingerprint with two other recently determined fingerprints from our laboratory. first, we compared the glaa overexpression transcriptome with the maltose transcriptome of a. niger. the maltose transcriptome was recently obtained by comparing carbon-limited chemostat cultures supplied with different carbon sources  but with the same specific growth rate   <cit> . this comparison showed that the production rate of extracellular proteins was about three-fold higher in maltose-grown cultures compared to xylose  <cit> . as shown in the venn diagram depicted in figure  <dig>   <dig> genes were commonly induced in both b <dig> versus n <dig> and maltose versus xylose and thus represent the most interesting genes with respect to high-level secretion in a. niger. go enrichment analysis of this set of genes confirmed that genes related to er import, translocation, n-glycosylation, and copii transport are of utmost importance for ensuring high protein traffic through the secretory pathway .

genes that are induced in b <dig> versus n <dig>  but not in maltose versus xylose, are likely to be genes that are mainly related to glaa overexpression per se. there are  <dig> such genes and go enrichment analysis uncovered two main categories , one of which is the ‘ion homeostasis’ category, as expected due to the high iron, calcium and zinc demand for glaa overexpression . the second category involves genes involved in ‘dna repair and dna replication’ and could hypothetically also be linked to the iron deficiency in b <dig> versus n <dig>  as many proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair and dna replication are iron-dependent  <cit> . genes that induced in maltose versus xylose but not in b <dig> versus n <dig> are likely to be genes, which are important for starch/maltose degradation but not for xylose catabolism. indeed, the enriched go categories of this gene set  contained ‘starch metabolic processes’ and other catabolic process related to ‘carbon source oxidation’, ‘amino acid metabolism’, and ‘respiration and oxidative stress’ . these are processes important for  high atp generation during oxidative phosphorylation in the respiratory chain and do likely form the energetic basis for the observed higher secretory flux in maltose cultures compared to xylose cultures despite similar growth rates. there were  <dig> commonly repressed genes in b <dig> versus n <dig> and in maltose versus xylose, but only a small fraction of these genes could be assigned to enriched go terms related to ‘saccharide catabolic processes’ .

comparison of the glaa overexpression transcriptome with other high-secretion transcriptomes
in order to determine so far unknown haca targets and their involvement in upr, we have recently determined the haca transcriptome by expressing a constitutively active form of haca  in a. niger <cit> . using bioreactor-controlled batch cultures, we compared the genome-wide expression profiles of a strain expressing hacaca with a wild-type strain  at three different time points during the exponential growth phase. at each of the three time points the up-regulated gene set of the hacaca cultures contained genes related to protein traffic through the secretory pathway, and to the upr and erad response  <cit> . when comparing these data with the glaa-overexpression transcriptome, one might expect a considerably overlap due to the fact that overexpression of glaa induced splicing of the haca mrna  and thus activation of haca. indeed, the transcriptional response in b <dig> had more in common with hacacaversus hacawt  than with maltose versus xylose . commonly induced genes in b <dig> versus n <dig> and hacacaversus hacawt were predicted to function in ‘vesicle coating’. ‘targeting from the er to the golgi’, ‘n-glycosylation’, and ‘copii transport’.

for a more condition-independent view on how the a. niger transcriptome ensures high-level secretion, we finally compared the transcriptomic dataset of seven independent studies performed with a. niger: i) the glaa-overexpression transcriptome obtained from chemostat cultures of b <dig> versus n <dig> , ii) the maltose-high secretion transcriptome obtained from chemostat cultures of maltose versus xylose  <cit> , iii) the haca transcriptome reflecting permanent activation of upr and obtained from batch cultures comparing hacacaversus hacawt <cit> , and iv) three upr stress transcriptomes obtained from a. niger batch cultures stressed with dtt, tunicamycin, or forced to express the heterologous protein t-pa  <cit> .

this analysis uncovered  <dig> genes whose transcript levels were commonly modified under all seven secretion stress conditions:  <dig> genes were up-regulated, and  <dig> genes were down-regulated . the genes from this set thus probably represent genes that are crucial for coping with stress conditions that target the secretion machinery. this gene set includes er chaperones and foldases , genes important for translocation of secretory proteins into the er , and genes important for protein glycosylation and copii-based vesicle trafficking . fascinatingly, a gene encoding the predicted acetyl-coenzyme a transporter  was consistently up-regulated under all seven conditions. in higher eukaryotes, this protein was shown to be involved in translocation of membrane-impermeable coenzyme a from the cytosol into the er lumen, where it is used for transient acetylation of er-based proteins, thus improving the folding efficiency of nascent secretory proteins  <cit> . it becomes therefore important to examine whether the predicted a. niger coa transporter fulfills the same function. similarly, the set of core genes included six hypothetical proteins, whose precise relevance for the secretory machinery remains to be elucidated in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the evidence is accumulating that the secretory machinery of a. niger is equiped with a high inherent flexibility, which enables the fungus to dynamically respond to changes in the secretory protein load. irrespective of whether different amounts of a homologous protein or a heterologous protein have to be accommodated and escorted, or a specific step in the secretory pathway becomes blocked, a. niger follows general and specific strategies to adapt to these challenges. on the one hand, the burden of high protein loads is in general dealt with increased transcript levels of genes involved in stabilizing the secretory pathway, including chaperone-encoding and foldase-encoding genes, transport genes, and upr- and erad-related genes. in addition, it seems likely that for the efficient secretion of individual proteins  an additional, particular set of genes becomes up-regulated, whose expression is important to deal with the specific requirements of the respective protein. on the other hand, a. niger attempts to avoid exceeding the maximum capacity of the secretory machinery. in doing so, the ress regulatory system offers a flexible way to lower transcript levels of those genes whose function is less important for growth and survival under the given circumstances.
