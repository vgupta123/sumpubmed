BACKGROUND
located within the ventrolateral medulla the prebötc is a central pattern generating neuronal network that rhythmically produces bursts of action potentials that are important for respiratory rhythmogenesis  <cit> . regarding inter-cellular communication, most research on respiratory rhythmogenesis has focused on chemical synaptic transmission and neuromodulation  <cit> . recent research has begun examining the potential contribution of electrical and cytoplasmic coupling via gap junctions in the functioning of central respiratory networks  <cit> . mammalian gap junctions, like ion channels, are multi-unit structures of integral membrane proteins  <cit> . the best studied of these proteins are connexins , although pannexins are also expressed in mammals  <cit> . a connexin-based gap junction channel is composed of two hemi-channels, or connexons, that together span the membranes of adjacent cells. each connexon is composed of six cx subunit proteins, each with four transmembrane domains, three intracellular regions , and two extracellular loops  <cit> .

multiple lines of evidence suggest that gap junction connectivity is important within the medullary region containing the prebötc. immunohistochemical and immunoblot studies indicate that neurons within the prebötc, as well as within other regions at the same rostro-caudal level of the medulla oblongata , express connexins of the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda families, termed cx <dig>  cx <dig> and cx <dig>  respectively  <cit> . a study using reporter genes and in situ hybridization supports the finding that cx <dig> is expressed by neurons in the region of the prebötc  <cit> . gap junction uncouplers such as cbx, 18α-glycerrhetinic acid , 18β-glycerrhetinic acid , heptanol, or octanol change the frequency and pattern of respiratory network burst generation  <cit> , even to the point of terminating prebötc rhythmogenesis after an hour of exposure to cbx  <cit> . dual intracellular recordings demonstrate that inspiration related neurons in the prebötc and nucleus ambiguous  are electrically coupled  <cit> .

the aforementioned evidence notwithstanding, the question of whether gap junctions have a functional role in prebötc rhythmogenesis remains unresolved. expression of cx mrna or protein does not demonstrate the presence of functional gap junctions. even when electrical coupling has been demonstrated between prebötc neurons, the coupling ratio between neurons was found to be low  <cit> . data suggesting that pharmacological manipulation of gap junctions affects the functioning of rhythmogenic networks must be interpreted cautiously; gap junction uncouplers are notorious for the broad range actions other than blockade of gap junction functionality  <cit> . by example, cbx, perhaps the most widely used uncoupler, attenuates transmembrane conductances including ca++ conductances in photoreceptors  <cit> , decreases the excitability of cultured neurons  <cit> , inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in arterial endothelial cells  <cit> , may trigger release of no from arterial endothelium  <cit>  and induces oxidative stress in liver mitochondria  <cit> . in the prebötc, cbx decreases neuronal input resistance and action potential production in response to depolarizing current pulses  <cit> .

as cbx exerts a variety of non-specific effects on neurons, others have proposed that cbx may affect prebötc rhythmogenesis through such actions, rather than by blocking gap junction communication  <cit> . because gza is similar in structure to cbx and is known to evoke a number of the same cellular responses, but without blocking gap junction connectivity, others have used it as a control for cbx when examining the effects of cbx on pre-bötc functionality at the network level  <cit> . however, in the prebötc at least, gza has not been used to control for the actions of cbx on discreet membrane properties. here we characterize the effects of cbx on membrane properties , holding current  at - <dig> mv, voltage-gated sodium current , and steady-state voltage-gated potassium current ) of prebötc neurons. our data are consistent with the hypothesis that gap junctions are important to the rhythmic production of inspiration-related neuronal activity by the prebötc. that is, by comparing the population-level and single-cells effects of cbx with those of gza, we demonstrate that while cbx alters and even terminates prebötc rhythmogenesis it does so without significantly affecting a number of critical neuronal variables.

RESULTS
effects of cbx and gza on population activity
earlier studies show that the specific effects of gap junction uncouplers on prebötc-related outputs  vary between species, age of organism, and between types of preparation  <cit> . thus, the initial part of this study determined whether medullary tissue from neonatal mice responded to cbx, a commonly-used gap junction uncoupler, in the same manner as it has been reported in previous studies  <cit> . within  <dig> minutes of exposure, cbx  decreased population burst frequency by  <dig> % from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz . after  <dig> minutes of cbx exposure burst frequency decreased by 47% to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz and by  <dig> hour cbx had completely suppressed bursting in all slices used in this study .

two types of controls were used in this study: slices treated with gza  and slices kept in acsf alone  throughout the experiments. although gza has been reported to affect some of the same aspects of cellular function as cbx, it produced no detectable effect on burst frequency, except at  <dig> minutes, when it appeared to cause a transient ~33% dip in population burst frequency from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz . slices kept in acsf with no drug addition for the same period as those treated with cbx or gza showed no significant change in population burst frequency .

although inhibition of neuronal/neuronal network function caused by short term exposure to cbx is reversible  <cit> , cbx may be cytotoxic at concentrations ≥  <dig> μm, or when applied for long periods   <cit> . accordingly, washout experiments were used to determine whether suppression of prebötc rhythmogenesis by cbx could be reversed. within 45– <dig> min after the beginning of the washout period,  <dig> of  <dig> slices resumed bursting. prior to cbx treatment the prebötc generated bursts at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz. during the period between  <dig> and  <dig> min following the initiation of washout slices generated bursts at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz .

in contrast to both control conditions , cbx decreased the area of population bursts . after  <dig> min of treatment, cbx decreased population burst area by 40% from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig> μv·s <dig> . burst area remained relatively unchanged for slices kept in acsf or in gza. as bursting ceased by  <dig> hr of treatment with cbx, there was no burst area to measure at this time point. by contrast, even after  <dig> hr of recording, slices in acsf continued to generate bursts with  <dig>  ±  <dig> % the area observed during initial  recording. similarly, after  <dig> hr of recording, slices in gza continued to generate bursts with  <dig>  ±  <dig> % the area observed during baseline recording.

cbx decreased burst area by affecting burst amplitude, rather than burst duration. after  <dig> minutes of cbx treatment, burst amplitude had decreased by 25% from  <dig> e- <dig> μv·s to  <dig> e- <dig> μv·s , and after  <dig> minutes by 46% to  <dig> e- <dig> μv·s . in contrast, burst duration remained relatively constant throughout the treatment with cbx  . whereas  <dig> hr of cbx treatment stopped burst generation, the burst amplitude and duration of slices in acsf and gza remained indistinguishable form baseline levels throughout recording. after  <dig> hr, slices in acsf continued generating bursts with a mean duration and amplitude of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms and  <dig> e- <dig> μv·s <dig>  respectively .

effects of cbx and gza on whole-cell properties
prior studies  <cit>  within the prebötc examined the actions of cbx on single neuron/membrane properties, without comparing these actions to those of a control agent . in this study we did so using whole cell voltage clamp. whole-cell voltage clamp measurement often remained stable for up to an hour with cells exposed to normal acsf or gza. however, in the presence of cbx few whole-cell recordings lasted for more than  <dig> min.

it has been reported in an earlier study  <cit>  that in prebötc neurons, cbx alters passive membrane properties and thereby decreases neuronal excitability. we found that rin of both cbx and gza treated neurons progressively decreased over time . by contrast, rin remained similar to its initial value for neurons in slices exposed to acsf  for the same duration as those exposed to cbx or gza. over a period of  <dig> min the ihold of neurons monitored in acsf changed little . in contrast, gza and cbx both increased the magnitude of the negative holding current .

all values shown were obtained from neurons in the presence of cdcl <dig> and comparison was performed between values for respective time intervals.

little is known about the effects of cbx on voltage-gated conductances, therefore we tested whether cbx would alter transient voltage-gated sodium currents  and steady state potassium currents  using standard voltage-step protocols. under control conditions ina did not significantly change throughout the duration of the experiments . in contrast, ina density of neurons treated with cbx progressively increased over time. at the command voltage evoking the peak ina , cbx significantly increased ina density after  <dig> minutes from - <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa·pf- <dig> to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa·pf- <dig>  and after  <dig> minutes to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  . by contrast, gza treatment caused no significant change in ina or ina density .

voltage-gated potassium currents were not detectably affected by cbx or gza. for example initially, a voltage step from - <dig> mv  to a command potential of  <dig> mv evoked ikd at a current density of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa·pf- <dig> after  <dig> minutes of cbx application, from the same voltage step evoked ikd at a similar density . the density of ikd of gza-treated neurons after  <dig> minutes of treatment  was similar to that observed initially .

discussion
the fact that gap junction uncouplers evoke numerous cellular responses in addition to blocking gap junction communication has impeded efforts to determine the extent to which gap junction communication may contribute to prebötc rhythmogenesis. nonetheless, it remains unclear as to when or whether gap junction blockers that don't otherwise interfere with neuronal functionality will be developed and/or become commercially available. the data presented herein extend prior work in characterizing previously undescribed effects of cbx on transmembrane currents of prebötc neurons. by comparing the effects of cbx on individual prebötc neurons with those of the control agent, gza our data provide direction and the initial steps in clarifying the ambiguity concerning how cbx affects network level function.

in this study substantial effort was put forth to determine the effects of cbx on rhythmogenic activity of the prebötc and to qualitatively compare these data with those of prior studies  <cit> . doing so was important at this stage in our research program as the importance of gap junctions, or at least the effects of uncouplers, appears to vary from one description to another. for instance, whereas cbx, 18α-ga and 18β-ga decrease the frequency of phrenic nerve rootlet inspiratory activity observed using en-bloc brainstem preparations and medullary slice preparations from neonatal swiss-webster mice  <cit>  these agents increase phrenic burst frequency observed using in vitro arterially perfused rat preparations  <cit> . rekling and colleagues  <cit> , using the medullary slice preparation from neonatal mice found that simply extending the period of cbx exposure to 45– <dig> min totally suppressed breathing-related output. by contrast, gap junction uncouplers administered arterially to in situ preparations from juvenile rat produce no consistent effect on eupneic or gasp inspiration patterns  <cit> . yet others have demonstrated increases in eupneic phrenic burst frequency and modulation of the eupneic phrenic burst pattern with in situ preparations from rat  <cit> . our extracellular data are similar to those of others using the medullary slice preparation from juvenile mice  <cit> .

the medullary slice preparation used for this study is vastly more reduced than most of the other preparations used to study respiratory rhythmogenesis   <cit> . nonetheless, the ~ <dig> μm-thick slice likely contains portions of adjacent regions, including the bötzinger complex and rostral ventral respiratory group  <cit> , that could potentially modulate prebötc rhythmogenesis  <cit> . thus, it is conceivable that application of uncouplers to the slice preparation could affect prebötc rhythmogenesis not by acting directly on the prebötc, but indirectly by actions on neurons in nearby regions that in turn modulate the activity of the prebötc.

knowing that gap junction uncouplers tend to exert a variety of non-specific effects, ideally their use would be coupled to the use of an appropriate control agent; that is, a substance that mimics as many of the non-specific actions of the uncoupler as possible, without blocking gap junction communication. both cbx and gza elicit at least some of the same cellular responses. for instance, cbx and gza have been reported to attenuate ca++ currents, albeit in separate tissues  <cit> . however, only a small proportion of studies examining the potential role of gap junction communication in prebötc rhythmogenesis employ control agents, such as gza as a control for cbx, or heptanol, as a control for octanol  <cit> . none use gza to control for the actions of cbx examined at the level of individual prebötc neurons.

consistent with the decreased neuronal excitability attributed to cbx in prior work  <cit>  cbx in the present study decreased rin. however, whereas such actions led prior workers to deem the network level effects of cbx inconclusive  <cit> , the use of gza as a control in this study suggests that the effects of cbx on resting membrane properties may not be sufficient to affect the rhythmic output of the prebötc observed at the population level. this result should not be interpreted as a suggestion that cbx fails to affect other variables related to neuronal excitability, only that since both cbx and gza decrease rin and evoke an outward holding current in prebötc neurons voltage clamped at - <dig> mv cbx must affect network level output by affecting another mechanism or mechanisms. interestingly, whereas others found that cbx causes neuronal hyperpolarization we found that both cbx and gza induced an inward holding current relative to neurons kept in acsf. as access resistance was monitored throughout experimentation and only samples for which this variable was both less than  <dig> mΩ and less than  <dig>  times the rin were used, it seems unlikely that such a striking increase would reflect deterioration of the seal between the membrane and the patch pipette. both cbx and gza affect active transport and in so doing could lead to longer term changes in ionic equilibria  <cit> . regardless, as both cbx and gxa induced similar changes in ihold, it is unlikely that the effects of cbx on ihold contribute to its overall effects on prebötc rhythmogenesis.

another possibility is that cbx decreases prebötc rhythmogenesis not by blocking gap junction communication, but rather by affecting voltage-gated conductances. this study examined potential effects of cbx and gza on ina and ikd. neither cbx nor gza affected ikd, showing that alteration of  voltage-gated potassium conductances does not contribute to the alteration of prebötc rhythmogenesis by cbx. by contrast, whereas cbx steadily increased the density of ina, gza produced no detectable change in this variable. however, it is unclear whether such a change would lead to the network-level effects associated with cbx. in retinal photoreceptors cbx decreases ca++ currents  <cit> . in the prebötc such changes could impede burst production by one subset of pacemaker neurons, the calcium-dependent pacemakers  <cit> . attenuation of ca++ currents would also depress  synaptic transmission, thereby depressing network-level output. it must be noted that rather than identifying distinctly respiration-related neurons, this study focused on all neurons within the prebötc.

accordingly, upcoming studies will explore potential effects of cbx and gza on a variety of voltage gated ca++ currents in inspiration-related prebötc neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented herein represent an important step in resolving the issue of whether or not gap junction communication is important to prebötc rhythmogenesis. rhythmic output generated by the population of prebötc neurons was depressed by cbx but not gza. in contrast, both cbx and gza affected resting membrane properties in the same way, and neither affected ikd suggesting that the network level effects of cbx are caused by it affecting one or more other cellular actions. in that our data demonstrate cbx affects a number of membrane properties in the same manner as gza, which does not affect network-level output, they are consistent with the notion that cbx inhibits rhythmogenesis by interfering with gap junction coupling between prebötc neurons. however, the non-specific actions of cbx examined herein represent only a subset of those attributed to cbx. to completely evaluate the notion that cbx affects prebötc rhythmogenesis by uncoupling gap junction channels, future research will need to evaluate the actions of cbx on numerous neuronal variables . however, characterizing the actions of cbx on such variables will not, on its own, demonstrate conclusively that any one of those properties, or any combination of those properties, underlies the actions of cbx on network-level output. as shown here, applying the most fundamental of all scientific principles, the use of an appropriate control, provides the opportunity to potentially falsify the notion that cbx-induced changes in a given neuronal property cause its network level effects. using this approach can thus strengthen one's confidence that cbx-induced changes in a variable cause, or are unrelated to its network level effects.
