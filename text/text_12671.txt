BACKGROUND
there are a total of six genes in the arabidopsis genome that encode a unique subfamily of myb transcription factors, namely single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors. these transcription factors, including triptychon   <cit> , caprice   <cit> , trichomeless <dig>   <cit> , enhancer of try and cpc  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> )  <cit> , are characterized by their short sequence  and consist largely of the single myb domain . it is generally believed that these single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors mediate lateral inhibition during epidermal patterning. in general, these single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors act as negative regulators for trichome formation in shoots, but as positive regulators for root hair formation in roots.

t-dna insertion mutants are available for each of these six single-repeat r <dig> myb genes. among them, only single loss-of-function mutants for try, cpc and tcl <dig> display major defects in trichome and/or root hair cell specification  <cit> , whereas loss-of-function alleles of etc <dig>  etc <dig> or etc <dig> cause little or no phenotypic effect  <cit> . the analysis of double and triple mutants indicated that etc <dig> and etc <dig> can function redundantly with try and cpc to control leaf trichome and root hair formation  <cit> , and that etc <dig> functions redundantly with try and cpc to control trichome formation on petioles  <cit> . further, cpc functions redundantly with tcl <dig> to control trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels  <cit> . however, a role of tcl <dig> in leaf trichome and root hair formation has not been established.

available evidence suggests that single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors, a wd40-repeat protein, transparent testa glabra <dig>   <cit> , an r2r <dig> myb-type transcription factor, glabra <dig>   <cit>  or werewolf   <cit> , a bhlh transcription factor, glabra <dig>  or enhancer of glabra <dig>   <cit> , and a homeodomain protein, glabra <dig>   <cit> , regulate trichome and/or root hair formation . based on the results of yeast-two-hybrid interaction assays, it has been proposed that ttg <dig>  gl <dig> or wer, and gl <dig> or egl <dig> form an activator complex to induce gl <dig> expression  <cit> . the single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors are proposed to move from a trichome precursor cell to its neighboring cell  or from an n cell to an h cell  to compete with gl <dig> or wer for binding gl <dig> or egl <dig>  thus limiting the activity of the activator complex  <cit> . recently, we showed that one of the single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors, tcl <dig>  can directly suppress the transcription of gl <dig>  <cit> , providing an additional loop of regulation of the activity of the proposed activator complex by single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors.

it has been proposed that the same activator complex that activates gl <dig> can also activate the expression of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes , but so far only cpc has been identified as a direct target gene for wer  <cit> , and gl <dig> has been shown to be recruited to the promoter region of cpc and etc <dig>  <cit> .

to gain new insight into the role of single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors in controlling epidermal development, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the single-repeat r <dig> myb gene family. by generating and analyzing higher order mutants among six single-repeat r <dig> myb genes, we identified previously unrecognized roles of single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors in the regulation of trichome and root hair formation. we demonstrate that tcl <dig> participates in the control of leaf trichome and root hair formation, and that etc <dig> and etc <dig> have a role in regulating trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicles. we also discover that single-repeat r <dig> mybs normally suppress trichome formation on siliques and cotyledons. by using an arabidopsis protoplast transfection system, we show that cotransfection of gl <dig> or wer, with gl <dig> or egl <dig>  is sufficient to activate the transcription of try, cpc, etc <dig> and etc <dig>  but not etc <dig> and tcl <dig>  our results suggest that although the six single-repeat r <dig> myb genes have largely overlapping functions in controlling epidermal development, the transcriptional regulation of these single-repeat r <dig> myb genes involves distinct mechanisms.

RESULTS
single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors in arabidopsis
sequence analysis of the arabidopsis genome using the blast program  with the entire amino acid sequence of tcl <dig> reveals that there are a total of six genes, including try, cpc, tcl <dig>  etc <dig>  etc <dig> and etc <dig>  encoding single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors that are approximately 50% identical to one another at the amino acid level. these six genes are unevenly distributed in four of the five chromosomes of arabidopsis . among them, etc <dig>  and tcl <dig>  are tandem genes located in chromosome ii . the amino acid signature l ×  <dig>  × 3l × 6l × 3r  <cit>  that has been shown to be required for interacting with r/b-like bhlh transcription factors is completely conserved in all single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors . the amino acids within the myb domain that have been shown to be crucial for the cell-to-cell movement of cpc  <cit>  are also entirely conserved in all single-repeat r <dig> mybs . phylogenetic analysis using the entire amino acid sequence suggested that these six single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors can be divided into two groups, with tcl <dig>  etc <dig>  ect <dig> and cpc in group i, and try and etc <dig> in group ii .

tcl <dig> affects both leaf trichome and root hair formation
among the six single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors, try and cpc have been shown to be involved in both leaf trichome and root hair formation  <cit> , while etc <dig> can function redundantly with try and cpc to control leaf trichome and root hair formation  <cit>  and etc <dig> functions redundantly with try and cpc to control trichome formation on petioles  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that etc <dig> functions redundantly with single-repeat r <dig> mybs to regulate both trichome and root hair formation  <cit> . however, a role of tcl <dig> in leaf trichome and root hair formation has not been established, although previously, we showed that tcl <dig> controls trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicles  <cit> . to test if tcl <dig> participates in the control of leaf trichome and root hair formation, we generated double, triple and quadruple mutants among all single-repeat r <dig> myb genes in group i including tcl <dig>  etc <dig>  etc <dig> and cpc . consistent with previous report  <cit> , the cpc single mutant has significantly increased trichome number on leaves . all other single mutants of group i genes examined are indistinguishable from wild-type plants . we found that although double and triple mutants including cpc  are similar to the cpc single mutant, and double and triple mutants between etc <dig>  etc <dig>  and tcl <dig> are similar to wild type , the cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> tcl <dig> quadruple mutant has dramatically increased trichome number on leaves than cpc single mutant and cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> triple mutant , indicating that tcl <dig> is involved in the regulation of leaf trichome formation.

subsequently, we examined root hair formation in these mutants. as shown in figure 2b and table  <dig>  cpc single mutant had reduced root hair formation, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . compared with the cpc single mutant, the cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> triple mutant produced fewer root hairs . moreover, cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> tcl <dig> quadruple mutant produced significantly fewer root hairs than cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> triple mutant , indicating that tcl <dig> also participates in the regulation of root hair formation.

etc <dig> and etc <dig> participate in the control of trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicles
previously, we reported that tcl <dig> is a major regulator of trichome formation on the inflorescence stem and pedicels because tcl <dig> single mutants displayed ectopic trichome formation on pedicels, and trichome formation on inflorescence stems was no longer restricted to the internodes before the first flower  <cit> . no other single mutant of the single-repeat r <dig> myb gene family displayed ectopic trichome formation on the inflorescence stems or pedicels. we have previously shown that cpc acts synergistically with tcl <dig> to control trichome formation on these organs  <cit> . in this study, we wanted to further investigate if any other single-repeat r <dig> mybs can also regulate trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels.

we examined trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicles in the double, triple and quadruple mutants of all single-repeat r <dig> myb genes in group i including tcl <dig>  etc <dig>  etc <dig> and cpc. compared with the tcl <dig> single mutant or the cpc tcl <dig> double mutant, cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> tcl <dig> quadruple mutants have more internodes bearing trichomes  and more pedicels forming ectopic trichomes . in addition, ectopic trichome formation was also found on the pedicels of the cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> triple mutants . unlike the tcl <dig> mutant, whose trichomes are evenly distributed along pedicels, trichomes tend to form at both ends of the pedicels of the cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> mutant . these results supported the notion that tcl <dig> is the major regulator of the single-repeat r <dig> myb family controlling trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels, and that cpc, etc <dig> and etc <dig> participate in the control of trichome formation on those organs.

single-repeat r <dig> mybs function redundantly to control trichome formation on siliques and cotyledons
having generated quadruple mutants with combination of loss-of-function mutations in all group i members of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes, including cpc, etc <dig>  tcl <dig> and etc <dig>  we sought to generate higher order mutants. the group ii small mybs contains two members, try and etc <dig> . as discussed above, etc <dig>  and tcl <dig>  are tandem genes located in the chromosome ii , which inhibits the generation of sextuple mutants that contain loss-of-function mutations in all six single-repeat r <dig> myb genes through classical crosses. therefore, in this study, the highest order mutant we generated was a quintuple mutant contains loss-of-function mutations in all four members of group i and try of group ii of the single-repeat r <dig> myb gene family.

by analyzing the try cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> tcl <dig> quintuple mutant and other mutants, we made two discoveries. first, in try cpc etc <dig> tcl <dig> quadruple mutants, ectopic trichomes were formed on the siliques . second, ectopic trichomes were formed on the cotyledons of try cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> tcl <dig> quintuple mutant . because these organs in wild-type plants do not bear any trichomes, these results indicated that single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors normally suppress trichome formation on these organs and acts in a highly redundant manner.

single-repeat r <dig> mybs function redundantly to control trichome cluster formation on leaves and inflorescence stems
among all single mutants of the single-repeat r <dig> myb genes, only the try mutant displays significant trichome clusters on leaves and shoots  <cit> . we wanted to examine whether other single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors function redundantly with try to control trichome spacing. consistent with that reported previously  <cit> , the size of the trichome clusters on leaves increased significantly from the try cpc double mutant to the try cpc etc <dig> triple mutant . we found that the size of trichome clusters on leaves was further increased in the try cpc etcl tcl <dig> quadruple mutant , suggesting that tcl <dig> also contributes to the control of trichome spacing on leaves.

we also found that etc3- <dig> mutation can increase trichome cluster frequency in cpc mutant background. as shown in table  <dig>  the cpc, etc <dig>  tcl <dig>  and etc <dig> single mutants are similar to wild type in term of trichome cluster formation. however, in the cpc etc <dig> double mutant, about  <dig> % of its trichomes are in clusters, and the number of trichome clusters was increased to about 7% in cpc etc <dig> etc <dig>  and about 16% in cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> tcl <dig> . these results supported the notion that try is the major regulator for controlling trichome cluster formation, and suggested that other single-repeat r <dig> mybs contribute to trichome cluster formation by functioning in a redundant manner.

subsequently, we examined trichome cluster formation on the inflorescence stems. as discussed earlier, tcl <dig> is a major regulator of trichome formation on the inflorescence stems whereas try controls the formation of trichome cluster. as expected, extensive trichome clusters were found on the inflorescence stems of try cpc etc <dig> tcl <dig> quadruple mutants .

single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors interact with gl <dig> in plant cells
our genetic analyses indicated that single-repeat r <dig> mybs regulate trichome and root hair formation in a highly redundant manner. we next wished to study their mechanism of action in trichome and root hair formation. it has been shown that some of these single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors, including try, cpc, etc <dig>  etc <dig> and etc <dig>  interact with gl <dig> in yeast cells  <cit> . this property has been proposed to enable the single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors to compete with gl <dig> for binding gl <dig>  thus limiting the activity of ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl1/wer activator complex and inhibiting trichome formation and promoting root hair formation  <cit> . although tcl <dig> is likely to behave similarly as try, cpc, etc <dig>  etc <dig> and etc <dig>  a direct test of the interactions between tcl <dig> and gl <dig> has not been performed. further, the interactions in yeast cells  have not been confirmed in plant cells. therefore, in this study, we tested the interactions between gl <dig> and each of these six single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors using a plant two-hybrid protein-protein interaction system  <cit> .

a gal4-gus reporter, together with the effectors gl <dig> and a gal <dig> dna binding domain  fused single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factor , were co-transfected into arabidopsis protoplasts. although single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors can be recruited to the promoter region of the reporter gene by gd, they alone cannot activate the expression of the reporter gene due to the lack of a transcription-activating domain. activation of reporter expression can occur if the small myb protein interacts with gl <dig>  because gl <dig> can function as a transcriptional activator . indeed, try, cpc, etc <dig>  etc <dig> and etc <dig> interacted with gl <dig> in plant cells , consistent with the results reported in yeast cells  <cit> . using this system, we also showed that tcl <dig> is able to interact with gl <dig> . thus, all six single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors can interact with gl <dig> in plant cells, implying that gl <dig> binding may represent a general mechanism of single-repeat r <dig> myb action in inhibiting the activity of the ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl <dig> activator complex.

transcriptional regulation of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes
it has been proposed that the ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl <dig> activator complex in shoots not only promotes the transcription of gl <dig>  but also promotes the transcription of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes, and a similar mechanism has been proposed to operate in roots with wer replacing gl <dig> . in support of this view, gl <dig> has been shown to be recruited to the promoter region of cpc and etc <dig>  <cit> , and cpc has been identified as a direct target gene for wer  <cit> .

to investigate whether activation of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes by the ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl1/wer complex represents a general regulatory mechanism, we used an arabidopsis mesophyll protoplast transfection system  <cit> . this system has been successfully used to elucidate the regulatory roles of many other transcription factors [34–38). first, we examined the expression of each component of the activator complex in arabidopsis rosette leaf mesophyll protoplasts. we found that ttg <dig>  wer, gl <dig>  gl <dig> and egl <dig> transcripts were undetectable by rt-pcr in wild-type protoplasts, whereas all of them were expressed in the whole seedlings . these results indicated that arabidopsis rosette leaf mesophyll protoplasts are suitable for the study of transcriptional activity of these activator complexes by transfection assays because the potential interferences by the endogenous ttg <dig>  wer, gl <dig>  gl <dig> and egl <dig> are minimized. we also found that the basal transcript level of try was highest among all single-repeat r <dig> myb genes in untransfected protoplasts . in a preliminary test using arabidopsis protoplasts from wild-type, we found that gl <dig> and gl <dig> are required and sufficient to induce the expression of cpc . therefore, in order to simplify our cotransfection assays, we decided to use protoplasts prepared from ttg <dig> mutant rosette leaves to test the activation of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes by the gl3/egl3-gl <dig> or gl3/egl3-wer activator complex. to further ensure that the elimination of ttg <dig> would not impair the transcriptional activity of the activator complex, we compared the transcriptional activation of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes by gl1+gl <dig> or ttg1+gl1+gl <dig>  we found that the gl1+gl <dig> combination was as effective as ttg1+gl1+gl <dig> to activate the transcription of the single-repeat r <dig> myb genes . by using this system, we found that none of the components in the proposed activator complexes alone could activate the transcription of any single-repeat r <dig> myb genes . however, gl <dig> or wer together with gl <dig> or egl <dig> were sufficient to activate the transcription of try, cpc, etc <dig> and etc <dig>  but not tcl <dig> and etc <dig> . these results indicated that some, but not all, single-repeat r <dig> myb genes are induced by the proposed activator complexes.

to further investigate if those four single-repeat r <dig> myb genes activated by the gl1-gl3/egl <dig> or wer-gl3/egl <dig> complex, including try, cpc, etc <dig> and etc <dig>  are tightly regulated by the activator complexes, we examined the expression of these genes in the gl <dig> egl <dig> double mutant background. we reasoned that if these single-repeat r <dig> myb genes are solely regulated by these activator complexes, their expression would be dramatically reduced in gl <dig> egl <dig> double mutant due to the disruption of the activator complexes. surprisingly, we found that among these four single-repeat r <dig> myb genes, etc <dig> was the only gene whose transcript was dramatically reduced in the gl <dig> egl <dig> double mutant . in order to more accurately compare the transcript level of try, cpc and etc <dig> between wild-type and gl <dig> egl <dig> mutant, we used quantitative real-time pcr to quantify the transcript level of these genes. the results from quantitative real-time pcr confirmed that there is no difference in the transcript level of try and etc <dig> between wild-type and gl <dig> egl <dig> mutant whereas the transcript level of cpc was only weakly reduced  in gl <dig> egl <dig> mutant.

discussion
overlapping functions of single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors in regulating trichome and root hair formation
the six single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors in arabidopsis are highly similar to each other at the amino acid level . however, among these six single-repeat r <dig> myb genes, only single mutants of try, cpc and tcl <dig> displayed major phenotypes in epidermal cell development  <cit> , whereas single mutants of etc <dig>  etc <dig> and etc <dig> are largely indistinguishable from wild-type plants  <cit> . further, the phenotypes of try, cpc and tcl <dig> single mutants are distinct. try mutant displays characteristic trichome clusters in leaves  <cit> , cpc mutant has increased trichome formation on leaves and had decreased root hair formation  <cit> , whereas tcl <dig> mutant produces ectopic trichomes on inflorescence stems and pedicels  <cit> . these findings suggested that try is a major regulator regulating trichome cluster formation, cpc is a major regulator regulating root hair and trichome formation, whereas tcl <dig> is a major regulator regulating trichome formation on inflorescence stems and pedicels. available evidence suggested that single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors can also function redundantly to regulate trichome and root hair formation  <cit> . each of those previous studies of these single-repeat r <dig> mybs has been limited to an analysis of only a subset of these six genes, and furthermore, they have limited their attentions to epidermal development in only one or two of these organs. here we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the roles of single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors in trichome and root hair formation. our comprehensive analysis enables us to draw broader conclusions about the role of this gene family than were possible in the earlier studies.

mutants generated including the cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> tcl <dig> quadruple mutant containing loss-of-function mutations in all members of group i single-repeat r <dig> myb genes, and the try cpc etc <dig> etc <dig> tcl <dig> quintuple mutant. by analyzing these single, double, triple, quadruple and quintuple mutants, we made several new discoveries. first, we established a role for tcl <dig> in controlling leaf trichome formation and root hair formation . tcl <dig> has been shown to be a major regulator of the single-repeat r <dig> myb family controlling trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels  <cit> , but a role of tcl in controlling trichome formation on leaves and root hair formation had not been previously established. second, we established a role for etc <dig> and etc <dig> in controlling trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicles . we note that a recent study showed that a different allele of etc <dig>  called cpl3- <dig>  was shown to produce about 80% more trichomes and 20% fewer root hairs than wild-type  <cit> , which may be due to an allele-specific difference in etc <dig> effect. third, we found that mutations in tcl <dig>  etc <dig> and etc <dig> can increase leaf trichome cluster frequency in cpc mutant background . about 16% of the trichomes formed in clusters in the cpc tcl <dig> etc <dig> etc <dig> quadruple mutant . working together with try, they also control trichome cluster formation on the inflorescence stems . finally, we demonstrated that in addition to regulating trichome formation on leaves and inflorescence stems, single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors also regulate trichome formation on cotyledons and siliques . because these organs normally do not bear any trichomes, these results suggested that single-repeat r <dig> mybs normally suppress trichome formation on these organs in a highly redundant manner.

mechanism of the action of single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors in the regulation of trichome and root hair formation
the six single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors are approximately 50% identical to each other at the amino acid level . more importantly, these six single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors contain the amino acid signature l ×  <dig>  × 3l × 6l × 3r that has been shown to be required for interacting with r/b-like bhlh transcription factors  <cit>  . further, the amino acids within the myb domain that have been shown to be crucial for cell-to-cell movement of cpc protein  <cit>  are also entirely conserved in all six single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors . these results implied that all single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors have the potential to act in a similar manner by moving from cell to cell to compete with gl <dig> for binding gl <dig>  thereby limiting the activity of the ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl1/wer activator complex to regulate trichome and/or root hair formation. five of these six single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors, including try, cpc, etc <dig>  etc <dig> and etc <dig>  have been previously shown to interact with gl <dig> in yeast cells  <cit> . here we showed that all of these six single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors interact with gl <dig> in plant cells , supporting that competition mechanism between single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors and gl <dig> for binding gl <dig>  <cit> . these results suggested that single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors may mediate lateral inhibition in epidermal cell patterning by a general mechanism: competing with gl <dig> for binding gl <dig> to reduce the activity of the ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl <dig> activator complexes. it remains to be tested if all single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors can also directly suppress the expression of gl <dig> thus inhibiting the formation of the ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl <dig> activate complex, as has been demonstrated for tcl <dig>  <cit> .

regulation of the transcription of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes
previous studies suggested that the expression of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes is regulated by the ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl <dig> activator complex in shoots, and by the ttg1-gl3/egl3-wer activator complex in roots. these single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors move from a trichome precursor cell to its neighboring cell in shoots, or move from an n cell to an h cell in roots, to compete with gl <dig> or wer for binding gl <dig>  thus limiting the activity of activator complexes  <cit> . using an arabidopsis protoplast transfection system, we found that gl1-gl3/egl <dig> or wer-gl3/egl <dig> complexes are required and sufficient to activate the expression of try, cpc, etc <dig> and etc <dig> . however, we did not detect the activation of tcl <dig> and etc <dig> by these complexes . moreover, among the single-repeat r <dig> myb genes that can be activate by the gl1-gl3/egl <dig> or wer-gl3/egl <dig> complex, only the transcript of etc <dig> is dramatically reduced in the gl <dig> egl <dig> double mutant . these results implied that:  only the transcription of etc <dig> of the small myb gene family is tightly controlled by the gl1-gl3/egl <dig> and wer-gl3/egl <dig> activator complexes;  in addition to being controlled by the gl1-gl3/egl <dig> and wer-gl3/egl <dig> activator complexes, there are additional mechanisms controlling the transcription of try, cpc and etc3; and  the transcription of tcl <dig> and etc <dig> are controlled by unidentified mechanisms. therefore, our results suggested that there may be multiple, distinct mechanisms controlling the transcription of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes. the differential regulation of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes may contribute to the differences in their developmental functions, which might explain why so many genes with very similar function are maintained in the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
we have established that each of the single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors has a role in regulating trichome and root hair formation, and that these mybs largely function in a redundant manner. we demonstrate that a normal function of these mybs is to suppress trichome formation on leaves and inflorescence stems, and to suppress trichome formation on cotyledons, pedicels and siliques, organs that normally do not bear any trichomes. we confirm that gl <dig> binding may represent a general mechanism of action of single-repeat r <dig> mybs in inhibiting the activity of the ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl <dig> activator complex. we show that the transcription of small myb genes is likely regulated by multiple mechanisms. these results reveal genetic basis of organ-specific control of trichome formation and provide new insight into the lateral inhibition mechanism that mediates epidermal patterning.
