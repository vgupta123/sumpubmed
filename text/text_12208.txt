BACKGROUND
many transcription factors are expressed only transiently during development. after they have disappeared, the patterns of gene expression they have induced must be inherited by daughter cells. in eukaryotes, two groups of proteins, the polycomb-group  and the trithorax-group , fulfil this memory function. their existence was first revealed in drosophila melanogaster where homeotic gene  expression is established in early embryos by the transient gap and pair-rule transcription factors and controlled by pcg and trxg proteins during the rest of development  <cit> . the pcg and trxg proteins combine into several heteromeric complexes that bind chromatin. pcg complexes maintain hox gene silencing whereas trxg complexes counteract the action of pcg complexes . these proteins regulate many other genes such as engrailed  <cit> , ph  <cit> , fork head  <cit>  and the iroquois-complex  <cit> .

in drosophila, at least two pcg complexes called prc <dig> and prc <dig>  and two trxg complexes  have been biochemically purified . the prc <dig> complex contains the pcg proteins polycomb , polyhomeotic , posterior sex combs  and dring <dig>  and additional polypeptides such as the dna binding protein zeste  <cit> . the prc <dig> complex contains the pcg proteins extra sex combs , su <dig> and enhancer of zeste ), a histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig> , and the histone binding protein p <dig>  <cit> . pc is also found in another complex that contains the dna binding protein pipsqueak  <cit> , esc and e are found in a larger complex that contains polycomb-like , the histone deacetylase rpd <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> , and e is found in a complex that contains the deacetylase sir <dig>  <cit> . the trxg complex tac <dig> contains cbp, a member of the cbp/p <dig> histone acetyl tranferase  family, the anti-phosphatase sbf <dig>  and the trxg protein trx, which is homologous to mammalian mll/all and methylates histone h <dig> on lysine  <dig>   <cit> . lastly, the brm complex contains the trxg proteins brm, osa and moira. it is related to the yeast swi/snf atp-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, sharing four polypeptides with it, among which is the atpase brm  <cit> . it also contains bap <dig>  an hmgb protein that binds nonspecifically in the minor groove of the double-helix, thus bending the dna  <cit> .

in drosophila, the pcg and trxg proteins bind overlapping sequences called polycomb/trithorax response elements  . two pre/tres  have been demonstrated to be true maintenance elements , i. e. to control the maintenance of activation or repression of target loci through cell division  <cit> . a major issue is to understand how pcg and trxg complexes are specifically recruited to me. on the one hand, the specific recruitment of these complexes could be achieved by recognition of posttranslationally modified histone tails. for example, pc recognizes k <dig> methylation of h <dig> via its chromodomain. hence, prc <dig> may be recruited to chromatin by the recognition of the h3k27me <dig> mark laid down by prc <dig> through e  <cit> . furthermore, the methyl-transferase activity of e is required for correct repression of hox genes, suggesting that this histone modification is actually related to gene regulation  <cit> . on the other hand, dna binding proteins such as zeste, gaf , pho , the hmg-box protein dsp <dig>  and pipsqueak, which are present at some me, also seem to be involved in the specific recruitment of pcg and trxg  <cit> . indeed, their various combinations and associations with co-factors could make complex binding more specific.

in a large screen to identify modifiers of trxg mutations,  <dig> genes previously identified as pcg genes , e, psc, scm and su2) were isolated as enhancers of trxg phenotypes  <cit> . the authors suggested that the corresponding genes be renamed "enhancers of trithorax and polycomb"  to account for their role both in repression and activation of hox genes. further studies identified other etp proteins, among which is gaf  <cit> , or pho, which directly binds a pc-containing complex as well as the brm complex  <cit> . the chromodomain protein corto  <cit>  and the hmgb protein dsp <dig>  <cit>  also behave as etp. indeed, a loss-of-function allele of corto enhances the macrochaete phenotype of the trxg gene osa as well as the polycomb phenotype of the pcg genes mxc, pc, pcl, ph and the etp genes e and scm  <cit> . on the other hand, a dsp <dig> null allele enhances the haltere to wing transformation of several trxg mutants ash <dig>  brm, osa, trx), whereas male hemizygotes for this allele exhibit transformation of the a <dig> segment into a more posterior one, which is a polycomb phenotype  <cit> . thus, dsp <dig> also behaves like an etp. to date, little information regarding the mode of action of etp has become available. no etp has yet been found in trxg complexes. some of them belong to pcg complexes , psc and scm) but most of them 2) have not been found in pcg complexes to date. however, in embryonic extracts, corto co-immunoprecipitates with esc and pc, while su <dig> and gaf co-immunoprecipitate with pc, suggesting that these etps can transiently interact with pcg complexes  <cit> . how etps promote either the activation or the repression of a defined target gene is an open question.

to understand better the role of etp, we analyzed the interaction between corto and dsp <dig>  we show that both proteins co-localize at  <dig> sites on oregon-r polytene chromosomes. these include 84b, which corresponds to the distal part of the antp-complex. in addition, corto and dsp <dig> co-immunoprecipitate in embryonic extracts and directly interact through the hmg-boxes of dsp <dig>  moreover, we show that the corto and dsp <dig> genes interact and that corto, like dsp <dig>  is directly involved in the regulation of the hox gene scr. chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that corto, like dsp <dig>  localizes on a  <dig> kb-xbai me of the scr cis-regulatory sequences. on the basis of our results, we propose that both proteins interact on chromatin to regulate a subset of common targets including scr.

RESULTS
dsp <dig> and corto co-localize on polytene chromosomes
to address the genomic targets shared by corto and dsp <dig>  we first examined their binding on polytene chromosomes. corto was previously shown to bind polytene chromosomes at many discrete euchromatic sites and to share these binding sites partially with pcg proteins such as pc and ph, or with etps such as e, scm and gaf  <cit> . similarly, dsp <dig> binds polytene chromosomes at multiple loci and partially co-localizes with ph  <cit> . simultaneous detection of corto and dsp <dig> on chromosomes enabled us to reveal many overlapping sites . precise localization of corto and dsp <dig> on the polytene chromosomes of oregon-r flies revealed  <dig> euchromatic sites of antibody staining for corto and  <dig> for dsp <dig>  these sites are listed in figure  <dig> and compared with the pc sites previously determined using the same strain and staining conditions  <cit> . on oregon-r polytene chromosomes,  <dig> sites are shared by corto and dsp <dig>  moreover, pc shares  <dig> sites with corto and  <dig> sites with dsp <dig>  lastly,  <dig> sites are simultaneously occupied by the three proteins, notably 84b, which corresponds to the distal part of the antp-complex.

to examine whether dsp <dig> plays a role in corto recruitment, we looked at the localization of corto in the dsp <dig> homozygote mutant strain, which is devoid of dsp <dig> protein  <cit> . no modification of corto binding sites was observed in this strain, indicating that the dna-binding protein dsp <dig> is dispensable for corto recruitment to chromatin .

dsp <dig> and corto are parts of a common complex in embryos and interact directly
we also investigated whether corto and dsp <dig> belong to a same molecular complex in vivo by performing co-immunoprecipitation assays using extracts from 0– <dig> hour-old embryos. as shown in figure  <dig>  corto co-immunoprecipitated with dsp <dig>  indicating that dsp <dig> and corto are physically associated in embryos.

next, we asked whether dsp <dig> and corto interact directly. first, dsp <dig> was submitted to far-western analysis using full-length radiolabeled corto as a probe. the  <dig> amino acid dsp <dig> protein exhibits two polyglutamine series located in the 1– <dig> region, two hmg-boxes  and an acidic tail. as shown in figure 4a, corto was retained on full-length dsp <dig>  in order to identify the domain of interaction in the dsp <dig> protein, we used several truncated forms of dsp <dig>  neither deletion of the nh2-terminal polyglutamine regions nor that of the cooh-terminal acidic tail impaired corto binding . in contrast, corto did not bind to g <dig>  l <dig> or n <dig>  our results allowed us to conclude that the minimal dsp <dig> sequence needed for corto binding was an intact hmg-box preceded by twelve amino acids .

the reverse experiment, i. e. migration and transfer of the gst-corto fusion proteins incubated with radiolabeled dsp <dig>  gave no conclusive results owing to the difficulty in renaturing corto. we showed previously that the only noticeable domain of the  <dig> amino acid corto protein is a chromodomain located in the nh2-terminal half   <cit> . in order to characterize the corto domains interacting with dsp <dig>  we performed gst pull-down experiments using full-length or truncated forms of corto fused to gst and radiolabeled full-length dsp <dig>  the results are shown in figure 4b. dsp <dig> was retained by the full-length corto protein, corroborating the far-western results with dsp <dig>  moreover, dsp <dig> was retained by a gst fusion protein containing the nh2-terminal half of corto , but was not detectably retained on the cooh-terminal half . interestingly, dsp <dig> was not retained on the corto chromodomain .

taken together, these results indicate that, in vitro, dsp <dig> and corto directly interact through either the hmg-box a or the hmg-box b of dsp <dig> on the one hand, and the amino-terminal half of corto on the other.

corto and dsp <dig> interact genetically and participate in sex comb reduced  regulation
to determine whether corto and dsp <dig> are involved in common functions, we analyzed their genetic interactions. dsp <dig> hemizygous males present several homeotic transformations, notably a partial transformation of t <dig> to t <dig> leg as shown by a reduced sex comb , and a partial transformation of a <dig> to a <dig> as shown by the presence of bristles on the a <dig> sternite   <cit> . these phenotypes are related to a role of dsp <dig> in the regulation of scr and abdb, respectively. we observed that loss of corto strongly suppresses both homeotic phenotypes . together, these data suggest that corto is involved with dsp <dig> in hox gene regulation. notably, they suggest that both corto and dsp <dig> regulate scr in the t <dig> leg imaginal disc.

interestingly, dsp <dig> was previously shown to cause partial suppression of the gain-of-function allele scrs  <cit> . better to understand the relationship between corto and dsp <dig> in the regulation of scr, we analyzed genetic interactions between corto and scr. we first used two loss-of-function alleles of scr, the ems-induced scr <dig> allele and dfscx <dig>  a deficiency of the distal end of the scr cis-regulatory regions. males heterozygous for either allele sxc4/+) exhibit a reduction in the size of the sex comb on the first leg with an average number of  <dig>  teeth per comb. no modification of this kind was observed in scr1/corto- or dfsxc4/corto- males . we next checked the interactions between corto and the gain-of-function allele scr antpscx . in this allele, the insertion of a transposable element near the antp p <dig> promoter disturbs scr silencing in the t <dig> and t <dig> leg imaginal discs  <cit> . indeed, 39% of antpscx/+ males exhibited an ectopic sex comb on the t <dig> leg, i.e. a transformation of t <dig> leg into t <dig> leg. this percentage increased to 83%, 95% or 100%, depending on the corto allele, in antpscx/corto males . these results show that corto, like pcg genes, participates in the maintenance of scr repression in the t <dig> and t <dig> leg imaginal discs and corroborates our previous results showing that corto interacts with some pcg genes for this ectopic sex comb phenotype  <cit> .

corto and dsp <dig> bind the same region within the 10-kb xbai fragment of the scr regulatory sequences
to analyze the roles of corto and dsp <dig> in scr regulation further, we addressed their binding to scr cis-regulatory sequences by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments . in s <dig> cells, xchip followed by southern analysis has previously shown that dsp <dig> binds two 1-kb sequences in the central part of a 10-kb xbai fragment located about 37-kb upstream from the scr transcription start  <cit> . formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin from 0– <dig> hour-old embryos or s <dig> cells was immunoprecipitated with either dsp <dig> antibodies, corto antibodies or rabbit serum as a control. binding of corto or dsp <dig> was analyzed by pcr amplification of  <dig> sequences  covering the central region of the 10-kb xbai fragment and two sequences  located on each side of this fragment. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  no binding of corto or dsp <dig> was observed on the sl and sr fragments. dsp <dig> did not bind fragments s <dig> to s <dig> in embryos but bound them in s <dig> cells, corroborating previous results  <cit> . maximum enrichment was observed for s <dig> and s <dig>  which overlap the two 1-kb sequences where dsp <dig> binding was previously observed  <cit> . corto binding was observed in both embryos and s <dig> cells. in embryos, we observed two main peaks of binding . interestingly, in s <dig> cells, corto covered the entire s <dig> to s <dig> region. therefore, the enlargement of the corto binding domain was correlated with the presence of dsp <dig> on the same fragment.

discussion
we report in the present work that the two etps corto and dsp <dig> interact genetically and that the proteins they encode  directly interact in vitro,  co-immunoprecipitate in embryos and  co-localize on  <dig> sites in salivary gland polytene chromosomes. these results suggest that the proteins are simultaneously involved in the regulation of several target genes. dsp <dig> can bind corto through one of the two hmg-boxes that also mediate dna binding. it has been suggested that during nucleoprotein complex formation, the hmg-box b of hmgb bends dna whereas the hmg-box a mediates interaction with transcription factors, thus promoting their contact with targets  <cit> . dsp <dig> seems to follow that scheme to enhance the binding of transcription factors as dorsal or bicoid to dna  <cit> . what therefore could be the role of the dsp1-corto interaction in the regulation of common targets? first, dsp <dig> could bring corto to the chromatin, where it could further interact with other partners. these partners could be pcg factors or gaf, which have previously been shown to interact with corto  <cit> . nevertheless, this hypothesis is unlikely since we observed no modification of corto binding to polytene chromosomes in the dsp <dig> strain. second, dsp <dig> could inhibit the interaction between corto and pcg factors or gaf, thus preventing the silencing of targets that bind both proteins. third, corto could modify the dna bending ability of dsp <dig> and thus modulate its interaction with other factors, for example trxg complexes. indeed, the dsp <dig> gene was previously shown to interact with the trxg genes trx and brm  <cit>  our results do not allow us to discriminate between these last two, non-exclusive possibilities.

we also report that the hox gene scr is a common target of corto and dsp <dig>  both proteins bind a 10-kb xbai fragment located 37-kb upstream of the scr transcription start. genetic studies have shown that this fragment is required for scr function in the embryo and in the imaginal disc  <cit> . in embryos, it restricts the expression of a scr-lacz fusion gene to the labial and prothoracic segments  <cit> , whereas in larvae it is required for scr expression in the first leg imaginal disc and for scr silencing in the second and third leg imaginal discs  <cit> . interestingly, the function of the 10-kb xbai fragment is sensitive to a subset of pcg and trxg mutations  <cit>  and has been genetically characterized as an upstream maintenance element of scr  <cit> . at the end of embryogenesis, the scr expression domain is restricted to the labial and prothoracic segments. in consequence, the mean state of this me in the whole embryo would be silenced. we can thus assume that the global situation in embryos mimics that of the t <dig> and t <dig> leg imaginal discs. conversely, since scr is expressed in s <dig> cells , we propose that the situation in s <dig> cells rather mimics that of t <dig> leg imaginal disc cells. hence, corto, which is present on the scr me whether active  or silenced , could be present on this me in all three leg imaginal discs. on the other hand, dsp <dig>  which is present on the me in s <dig> cells but not in embryos, could bind the me only in cells where this element is active, hence in t <dig> leg imaginal disc cells. we thus propose that both corto and dsp <dig> proteins localize on this scr me in the first leg imaginal disc.

some trxg mutants as well as the dsp <dig> null mutant exhibit a reduced sex comb and our previous work has shown that dsp <dig> interacts with certain trxg genes and regulates scr expression in t <dig> discs  <cit> . hmgb, the vertebrate homologue of dsp <dig>  has been reported to activate and stabilize the tfiid-tfiia-promoter complex in vitro  <cit>  and some trxg factors have been shown to interact with the rna polymerase ii complex, thus facilitating transcriptional elongation  <cit> . this leads us to propose that in the t <dig> leg imaginal disc, dsp <dig> facilitates the interaction between a trxg complex and the transcription machinery, thus maintaining scr activation. moreover, corto has been shown to interact with pcg complexes  <cit> . the binding of corto to dsp <dig> could then impede the interaction between corto and pcg complexes, thus limiting their recruitment. therefore, the interaction between the two proteins on the me would lead to a level of scr transcription compatible with t <dig> identity. conversely, in the t <dig> and t <dig> leg imaginal discs, since dsp <dig> does not bind the me, corto would be able to interact with pcg complexes, thus enhancing the silencing of scr.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown that the two etps corto and dsp <dig> directly interact and are simultaneously found on a scr me when active, whereas corto alone is found on the same me when inactive. our data suggest that different combinations of etp favor the recruitment of either pcg or trxg complexes, participating in the maintenance of the silenced or active state of me.
