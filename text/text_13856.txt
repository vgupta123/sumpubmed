BACKGROUND
comparison of gene families from different plants provides insights into gene functions that have evolved from common ancestral genes in order to meet unique requirements of each species. the availability of the complete genome sequences of two plants, the small flowering dicot, arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , and the agronomically important monocot, rice ,  <cit>  allows for analysis of gene functions that are shared between these diverse species. an important but little understood function that is common to all higher plants involves the mechanism underlying the signals that control time to flowering. recent studies suggest that some of the genes that regulate the floral transition in arabidopsis have homologous counterparts with a similar function in rice  <cit> . conversely, other genes that control flowering in rice and maize have no apparent functional equivalent in arabidopsis  <cit> . the transition to flowering is mediated by a complex network of pathways that integrate both environmental and developmental signals  <cit>  so it is not surprising that some gene functions are conserved, whereas other genes appear to have evolved distinctive functions to meet the specific floral transition requirements within a particular species.

the maize indeterminate <dig> gene , id <dig>  may exemplify a situation where one member of a gene family has acquired a function that is distinct from other family members. loss-of-function id <dig> mutants remain in a prolonged state of vegetative growth and form aberrant flowers  <cit> . so far, id <dig> is the only gene known to have a major role in controlling the transition to flowering in maize. analysis of genes related to id <dig> could provide insights into how modification of an ancestral function has lead to its current function and could reveal whether functional homologs of id <dig> exist in other plant species.

recent studies in species such as arabidopsis and rice show that transcription factor genes are key components of genetic networks that control the transition to flowering  <cit> . presumably loss of key regulators would affect the expression of batteries of downstream genes that mediate the complex transition process  <cit> . evidence for recent genome duplications throughout eukaryotic evolution  <cit> , might imply that the functions of many genes are redundant and may not be uncovered by single-gene mutation analysis. therefore it is of interest to analyze entire gene families at the genomic level in order to predict possible gene functions and to examine how new functions evolve from those of shared ancestral genes. this may be especially significant in the case of transcription factors, which are modular in nature; i.e., they typically contain a dna-binding domain and a separate activator or repressor domain. the latter domain is important for controlling the expression of genes that contain cis elements that are recognized by the dna-binding domain  <cit> . diverse new functions may be generated from the "mixing and matching" of dna binding domains with other elements of the proteins, resulting in the control of other networks of genes.

the id <dig> protein contains cys2his <dig> type zinc finger motifs that are related to animal regulator proteins such as kr√ºppel in drosophila and xfin in xenopus  <cit> . zinc fingers are one of the most abundant class of regulatory proteins represented in the eukaryotic genomes that have been sequenced to date  <cit>  and, in arabidopsis, zinc fingers apparently comprise the largest group of putative regulatory genes  <cit> . as the complete sequences of more genomes become available, greater effort is being directed at comparative studies of genes and gene families from different organisms  <cit> . genome-based approaches focus on questions about specific genes and gene families with regard to the function of ancestral genes, and how these genes evolved to suit the specific developmental requirements of particular organisms.

here we analyze the zinc finger proteins encoded by the family of idd genes found in two plants with sequenced genomes, rice and arabidopsis, and compare them with the id <dig> gene and all known id1-related genes identified in available maize sequence databases. comparison of the sequences and structures of the idd genes in these three species suggests that maize id <dig> is a unique member of this gene family, although putative functional homologs of id <dig> were discovered in the related grass species rice, as well as sorghum.

RESULTS
maize id <dig> defines the id-domain containing transcription factor gene family
the id <dig> gene was tagged with a ds <dig> transposable element that facilitated isolation of a full-length coding sequence  <cit> . in initial attempts to isolate the id <dig> coding sequence, cdna libraries made from 3-leaf seedling, vegetative apex, and developing inflorescence were screened with a portion of the id <dig> genomic sequence. more than  <dig> hybridizing clones were isolated from these libraries and found to correspond to  <dig> different classes of cdnas that were similar to id <dig>  however none of them corresponded to the maize id <dig> gene. these clones were designated id-domain genes , and given the names zmiddp <dig>  zmiddp <dig>  zmiddveg <dig> and zmiddveg <dig>  comparison of the id <dig> cdna sequence with the four related cdna clones revealed that they shared a highly conserved region of ~ <dig> amino acids . this conserved id-domain , has a putative nuclear localization sequence at the n-terminal border consisting of charged lysine  and arginine  residues  <cit> , followed by four distinct zinc finger motifs. two of the id-domain zinc fingers have the hallmarks of the tfiiia zinc finger class of proteins, whereas the other two zinc fingers have atypical structures and were identified by visual inspection of the deduced amino acid sequence and biochemical analysis of dna binding properties  <cit> .

low-stringency blast searches of available ncbi nucleotide and protein databases with id <dig> and the maize idd genes  as query sequences revealed significant similarity to zinc finger proteins from animals and yeast, as well as plants. the highest level of similarity, however, was found in a particular sub-group of plant zinc finger genes, as described below. that is, the extent of similarity of maize id <dig> and zmidd genes to animal and yeast sequences was limited mostly to the positioning of the zinc-interacting c and h residues and the conserved hydrophobic residues that define this protein class.  <cit> , whereas the plant sequences have extensive similarity throughout the id-domain  as well as some conserved domains in the c-terminal region . id-domain proteins therefore define a sub-group of zinc fingers that is highly conserved in higher plants.

a complete, annotated maize genome sequence is not yet available, but a large number of sequences have been collected in the gss  database, which contains gene-enriched maize dna sequences derived by methylation filtration  <cit> , high-cot enrichment and other methods that reduce repetitive sequences  <cit> . we extracted and reconstructed  <dig> partial and full-length maize idd genes from the gss collection. a large collection of maize est and cdna sequences recently made available by biotechnology companies and distributed by the national corn growers association  were used to complete most maize idd sequences . derivation of idd cdnas from these resources allowed the intron-exon structure and full-length versions of  <dig> idd genes to be deciphered, except for zmidd <dig>  for which a definitive stop codon could not be assigned . only one idd gene, zmidd <dig>  was found in the ncga collection that was not found also in gss or the public est/cdna databases. this suggests that the combined sequences of these two databases have extensive overlap and likely represent a large portion of the maize gene space. a similar level of coverage was reported for  <dig> full-length cdnas that were used to determine the level of coverage of the gss database and public est and cdna collections.

although the arabidopsis and rice genomes each have clearly identifiable idd genes , no phenotype associated with the loss of idd gene function has been reported yet in these species. maize has at least  <dig> idd genes , but so far only mutations in the id <dig> gene have been shown to have an effect on plant growth; i.e., a severe effect on flowering time and floral development  <cit> .

maize idd and id <dig> genes have diverse expression patterns
a previous study found that id <dig> mrna is expressed only in immature leaves and is not detectable in the shoot apical meristem region, leaf primordia or in mature leaves  <cit> . this highly specific expression pattern suggests that id <dig> has a role in mediating the production or the transmission of a leaf-derived floral inductive signal  <cit> . to compare the id <dig> expression pattern with other maize idd genes we used northern hybridization and gene-specific probes to the  <dig> idd genes isolated from maize cdna libraries: zmiddp <dig>  zmiddp <dig>  zmiddveg <dig> and zmiddveg <dig>  as well as  <dig> other zmidd genes, zmidd <dig>  zmidd <dig>  zmidd <dig>  with probes isolated by pcr . we found that each of these  <dig> maize idd genes had distinct expression patterns and that none of them exhibited tissue-specific expression similar to id <dig> . in all cases the range of expression is broader than id <dig>  with mrna of zmidd genes detected in most plant tissues . for example, whereas id <dig> mrna is confined to immature leaves and is clearly absent from other shoot tissues, zmiddp <dig> mrna is detected in all vegetative tissues, and is especially abundant in tissues enriched for shoot and root apical meristems . similar to id <dig>  the zmiddp <dig> gene is detected in immature leaves, albeit at a much lower level, but it is also expressed at low levels in root and is barely detectable in floral tissues . zmiddveg <dig>  which was isolated from a vegetative shoot apex cdna library, is detected in apical meristem-enriched tissues, but is also found in immature leaves, roots and, at a lesser level, in tassels . in contrast, zmiddveg <dig>  which was isolated from the same vegetative meristem cdna library as zmiddveg <dig>  shows a similar expression pattern, except that it is expressed at higher levels in floral tissues and it is detected in apical regions and leaf primordia but to a lesser extent in more developed immature leaves.

transcripts of zmidd <dig> and zmidd <dig> show nearly identical patterns; they are present in all tissues tested but highest amounts are seen in the stem region below the shoot apex . in contrast, zmidd <dig> mrna is abundant in flag leaf, tassel inflorescence and roots, but is barely detectable in stem, the shoot apex region or developing leaves . further, transcripts of all zmidd genes examined, except for id <dig>  are detected in the tassel inflorescence . overall, the  <dig> maize idd genes tested show wide-ranging expression in all shoot tissues tested and, unlike id <dig>  are not confined to immature leaf tissue.

isolation of putative id <dig> orthologs from rice and sorghum
before the first annotated draft of the rice genomic sequence was released, a genomic bac  library from the clemson university genomics institute  with ten times genome coverage of the japonica variety of oryza sativa was screened for idd genes. from this screen  <dig> bacs that hybridized to a full-length maize id <dig> probe were identified. of these, a subset of  <dig> bacs hybridized to a probe derived from id <dig> sequences outside the id domain . a  <dig>  kb fragment common to all  <dig> bacs was isolated and found to contain a coding region with a high level of similarity to maize id1; this gene was designated osid. maize id <dig> and rice osid have a similar exon/intron structure common to most idd genes; i.e., a small intron in the 5' region and a large intron that splits the fourth zinc finger . however, widespread regions of similarity were also found outside the id-domain in both the n-terminal and c-terminal regions of the deduced osid protein . that is, upstream of the putative nuclear localization sequence that delineates the left border of the id domain and downstream of the fourth zinc finger , which marks the right border.

the osid gene was identified in the first draft of the rice genome  <cit>  and no other gene with greater similarity to maize id <dig> than osid was detected. although the current draft of the rice genome may not contain all genes  <cit> , the fact that we only detected osid in the bac library screening suggests that it is the closest homolog to id <dig> in the rice genome. further, analysis of syntenic regions of the rice and maize genomes indicate that osid, which is located on rice chromosome  <dig>  lies in a region syntenic with maize chromosome  <dig>  in the region where id <dig> is located  <cit> .

in addition to rice, we searched recently available sorghum bicolor methylation filtered genomic sequences  <cit>  and identified a closely related idd gene, designated sbid, with significant homology to maize id <dig> and rice osid. as with osid, sbid has extensive regions of identity outside the id domain . overall, the full-length sbid and osid proteins are 84% and 61% identical to id <dig> protein, respectively. thus, the level of identity of sorghum sbid to maize id <dig> is the highest of any gene identified so far. the level of similarity shared by id <dig>  osid and sbid, indicate that these genes are closely related and could share homologous functions.

to investigate whether these related grass genes have similar expression patterns, an anti-id <dig> antibody specific for the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of id <dig> was used to analyse where osid and sbid proteins are localized in developing rice and sorghum. the deduced c-terminal peptide sequences of sbid and osid proteins are nearly identical to the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of id1; i.e., sbid and osid share 19/ <dig> and 18/ <dig> amino acids, respectively . figure  <dig> shows that this antibody cross-reacts with a single protein of the expected size in each species. interestingly, similar to maize id <dig>  osid and sbid proteins are detected exclusively in immature leaves and are absent in mature leaves and the region of the shoot apex . furthermore, all three idd proteins are absent in floral tissues in all species. therefore the identical localization patterns of id <dig> and its putative orthologs sbid and osid show that all three genes have similar expression patterns.

the arabidopsis and rice genomes have similar numbers of idd genes
the conserved id-domain encoding sequence of maize id <dig> was used to search for related genes in the arabidopsis genome. we found  <dig> arabidopsis id-domain encoding genes with comparable levels of similarity to id <dig> and the idd genes from maize . the arabidopsis idd genes, designated as atidd, share levels of amino acid identity with the id-domain of maize id <dig> that range from 63% to 84% , but, as was found with the zmidd genes, there is little homology in sequences outside the 5' and 3' id-domain coding regions, except in a few defined regions of certain genes, as described below . however, within this group of  <dig> genes, atidd <dig>  atidd <dig> and atidd <dig> are more closely related to one another and diverge from the other  <dig> atidd genes, showing only  <dig> to 64% identity to id <dig> . some of this divergence is the result of absence of conserved sequences outside regions encoding the id domain. no other zinc finger families in arabidopsis exhibit this level of similarity.

englbrecht et al  <cit>  defined a subfamily of  <dig> genes in arabidopsis, called a <dig>  that encode proteins with a configuration of four zinc fingers. they designated the  <dig> atidd genes defined here as a subclass of this group of  <dig>  with the  <dig> genes most similar to maize id <dig> termed a1a and  <dig> divergent members, atidd <dig>  atidd <dig> and atidd <dig>  comprising the a1b group. however, as a group the  <dig> atidd genes are much more divergent from the other  <dig> genes of the a <dig> grouping . that is, the zinc finger domains encoded by atidd genes are 63% to 84% identical to the maize id <dig> zinc finger domain , whereas they share less than 40% amino acid identity to the a1c and a1d members. therefore we designate atidd genes as a separate family based on their similarity to maize id <dig>  furthermore, the similarity between atidd genes extends beyond the zinc binding motifs and includes amino acid sequences that extend upstream and downstream of this region . overall, the id-domain is the defining feature shared by idd proteins from arabidopsis and maize.

sequences searches of the current draft of the rice genome have revealed  <dig> id-related genes, including osid, which is comparable to the  <dig> idd genes of arabidopsis. this number of id1-related genes in rice is in the range expected based on the  <dig> idd-hybridizing bacs described above. members of the rice family encoding id-domain zinc finger proteins are designated osidd genes. the deduced proteins of osidd genes have a comparable level of similarity to each other and to idd proteins of both maize and arabidopsis . in addition, osidd gene structures are similar to the structure of zmidd and atidd genes. for example, an intron splits the fourth zinc finger, zf <dig>  in all idd genes from these three species, except for maize zmidd <dig> and zmidd <dig> genes . a common structural feature shared by all idd genes is an intron that separates the 5' end of the gene from the id-domain coding region .

a feature unique to the maize id <dig> sequence is an intron that splits the second zinc finger, zf <dig> . even though osid has extensive regions of identity to maize id <dig> within the id domain coding region as well as outside the domain, it does not have an intron within zf <dig>  the sbid gene, like id <dig>  is the only other idd gene with an intron splitting the coding region of zf <dig> . this shared feature of id <dig> and sbid likely reflects the closer evolutionary distance between these two plants relative to rice; i.e.,  <dig>  million years between sorghum and maize vs.  <dig> million years between rice and maize  <cit> . overall, comparison of the structure of maize and arabidopsis idd genes, including id <dig>  showed that, with a few exceptions, overall intron/exon structure is conserved .

other conserved motifs are found outside the id domain of idd proteins
apart from the iarge id-domain, many idd family members have small domains of similarity in the c-terminal region of the deduced protein . two conserved regions that stand out are the "trdflg" domain, which is found in maize id <dig> and many idd proteins that are most similar to id <dig>  such as osid and sbid, and the msatallqkaa domain. the trdflg motif is largely invariant, except in cases such as atidd <dig> and osidd <dig> where the sequence is tldflg, osidd <dig> and zmidd <dig>  which contain the sequence tqdflg, and the potato pcp <dig> deduced protein, which has the sequence tkdflg .

the msatallqkaa motif is present in most of the arabidopsis idd genes and many maize and rice idd genes, but it does not occur in id <dig>  osid or sbid proteins . the presence of the trdflg sequence does not exclude the presence of mstallqkaa domains, and may reflect the modular nature of idd regulatory proteins.

phylogenetic comparison of idd genes from diverse plant species
phylogenetic trees reconstructed from genomic dna sequences from the conserved zinc finger region of all known idd genes from maize, arabidopsis and rice, along with the single pcp <dig> sequence from potato and sbid from sorghum showed extensive divergence of id1-like sequences in all well-sampled species . no clear outgroup could be identified to root the tree in such a way that would allow conclusions about ancestral sequences, as the sequences are only alignable in the zinc finger domains that define the group and no other related sequences could be found that had a sufficient degree of overlap. however, the unrooted  and midpoint rooted phylograms both suggested independent diversification of the gene family in grasses compared to those in potato and arabidopsis .

in arabidopsis, atidd <dig>  atidd <dig>  and atidd <dig>  were clearly divergent from the rest of the atidd sequences, whose relationships to one another  were not as clearly resolved . similarly, within the grasses, osidd <dig>  osidd <dig>  osidd <dig>  zmidd- <dig>  zmidd- <dig>  and zmidd- <dig> formed a strongly supported and distinctive grouping relative to the other sequences. within the main sequence cluster, there were a number of well-supported groupings that included sequences from both rice and maize , with id <dig>  sbid and osid forming a strongly supported  and distinctive grouping most closely related to the zmidd6/osidd <dig> and then the zmidd2/zmidd <dig> sequence groups. genomic sequences also identified zmidd <dig> and osidd <dig> as the most closely related to arabidopsis idd genes.

phylogenetic analyses based on amino acid sequences gave different trees than those based on nucleotide sequences, but may reflect functional similarities among highly divergent proteins between species . in particular, the amino acid analyses indicated mixed clustering of genes between arabidopsis and grasses whereas this was not seen in the genomic dna analysis. circled sets of sequences with the same letters are those that form highly supported "mixed" groups in the amino acid but not the nucleotide-based analyses. note in particular that the two most divergent groups of sequences within each group clustered together in the amino acid analysis , based on sharing of unique domains not found in the other sequence types . similarly, atidd <dig> and atidd <dig> appeared to be functionally related to zmidd <dig> and osidd <dig>  and zmidd7/osidd <dig> appeared to be most functionally related to arabidopsis sequences atidd <dig>  atidd <dig>  atidd <dig> and atidd <dig> . sequences in rectangles labeled 'd' are quite divergent from one another but formed a weakly supported  grouping between grasses and arabidopsis  sequences. importantly, no functional equivalent was found for the id1/osid/sbid group  in arabidopsis and their relationship to the zmidd6/osidd <dig> and zmidd8/zmidd10/osidd <dig> groups was not well resolved in the amino acid analysis.

discussion
the maize id <dig> flowering time gene encodes a putative transcription factor with four distinct types of zinc finger motifs  <cit> . initial searches for similar genes revealed that id <dig> is the first, genetically defined member of a highly conserved family of proteins that are found in all plant genome databases. the high level of similarity of idd genes from species as diverse as monocots and dicots is a striking feature of this gene family. here we have performed a comparative analysis of all available members of the idd family from three species: maize, rice and arabidopsis, as well as individual sequences from potato and sorghum. the complete genome sequences available for rice and arabidopsis show that these species have  <dig> and  <dig> idd genes, respectively. analysis of gss sequence data and an extensive maize cdna/est collection defined at least  <dig> idd genes in maize, including id <dig>  the finding that maize has significantly more genes than either rice or arabidopsis is likely due to the possible allotetraploid origin of the maize genome  <cit> . given that the maize genome sequence is incomplete, it is possible that more idd genes will be found. however, a recent evaluation of available maize genomic resources suggests that approximately 95% of the maize gene space has been at least partially uncovered  <cit> . a notable finding of our study is that, with the exception of one gene, unambiguous full-length coding regions were acquired for all zmidd genes, and the basic intron/exon structures were ascertained.

the functions of most idd genes are not known
the idd genes most closely related to maize id <dig> are the rice osid gene and the sorghum sbid gene . osid maps to chromosome  <dig> of the rice genome and does not coincide with any genes known to influence heading date, nor for other qtls for flowering time in rice  <cit> . however, qtl analysis can be limited by the populations examined, therefore analysis of rice from different geographical locations may yet uncover qtls that correspond to osid. transgenic experiments where osid is over-expressed or its expression is eliminated or reduced by gene silencing techniques are in progress to reveal whether osid has a role in controlling flowering time in rice, and also if maize id <dig> can control flowering in a heterologous grass species .

apart from the role of id <dig> in controlling the transition to flowering in maize, no other idd gene with a genetically defined biological function has been reported. the idd gene from potato, pcp <dig>  was isolated in a screen for cdnas that could rescue a yeast strain deficient in sucrose transport  <cit> . as a possible explanation for this finding the authors suggest that pcp <dig> may activate a previously unidentified sucrose transport system in yeast. saccharomyces cerevisiae normally is not capable of this function because yeast excretes invertase to metabolize external disaccharides and converts them into hexoses that are transported into the cell. the in planta biological role of pcp <dig> remains unresolved, and no follow-up reports have been forthcoming. however, it is intriguing to speculate that pcp <dig>  and perhaps other idd genes, may have a role in sugar metabolism in higher plants. this is especially interesting in light of evidence that sucrose, perhaps in combination with other metabolites, may play an important role in signaling the transition to flowering  <cit> . if any of the idd genes have a role in linking sucrose metabolism to plant development, it might be propitious to look for such a function amongst the maize, rice and arabidopsis idd genes that are most closely related to pcp <dig> . of course such speculation needs to be supported by functional determination.

the extensive reverse genetic resources available for arabidopsis allow for a functional genomic analysis of atidd genes. for example, we have recently discovered that loss of function of one of the divergent idd genes, atidd <dig>  has an effect on lateral shoot branching in arabidopsis . whether mutations in other atidd genes affect arabidopsis growth and development is a subject of current investigation.

conserved regions exist outside the id-domain
the designated id-domain starts with a putative nuclear localization signal  and ends  <dig> amino acid residues beyond the last c residue of the fourth zinc finger . the high degree of conservation of this region in idd proteins clearly delineates members of the id1-related gene family. however, there are sequence motifs outside the id-domain that allow for further sub-groupings of this gene family. a prominent conserved sequence found in maize id <dig> and most other idd genes is the tr/l/q/dflg sequence located near the c-terminus. in arabidopsis,  <dig> of the  <dig> atidd proteins have either a trdflg or tldflg sequence, and  <dig> of the  <dig> rice osidd sequences have this motif. in both rice and arabidopsis, idd peptides without this sequence fall into a more divergent group, with the exception of osidd <dig> and zmidd <dig>  which both lack this sequence and are closely related to each other . clearly this motif has been conserved across lineages, suggesting a possible function such as in mediating protein-protein interactions. however, at present it is difficult to unambiguously assign activator or repressor function to domains within transcription factors without biochemical characterization  <cit> . blast analyses of short peptide sequences with trdflg, tldflg and tqdflg as a query sequence show no other type of protein consistently harboring this motif except for idd genes from higher plants.

the msatallqkaa sequence is another small motif outside of the id-domain that is shared by some id1-related gene family members. this motif is absent in maize id <dig>  yet is present in other zmidd peptides for which sequences are available. the divergent group of idd proteins from maize, rice and arabidopsis  that do not have the tr/l/q/dflg motif similarly lack the msatallqkaa motif. it is interesting to note that these deduced proteins, which group together based on the similarities in their idd sequences only, also show major differences outside the id domain. this suggests that these sequences diverged early in angiosperm evolution and may have acquired separate and distinct functions.

maize id <dig> has several distinctive features
several lines of evidence suggest that maize id <dig> is functionally distinct from idd genes. first, maize id <dig> mutants have a dramatic late flowering phenotype, whereas mutations in other zmidd genes have not been reported. second, a  <dig> amino acid spacer separates zinc fingers zf <dig> and zf <dig> of the id <dig> protein, whereas the majority of idd proteins examined here have  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids between the first two zinc fingers. the putative id <dig> orthologs from rice  and sorghum  also have longer spacers between the first two zinc fingers than most idd genes, with  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. other exceptions include zmidd <dig> and osidd <dig>  but these genes belong to the divergent class of idd genes found in all three species  and therefore it is unlikely that they share a common function. other exceptions include zmidd <dig> and osidd <dig>  which have an additional  <dig> amino acids between zf <dig> and zf <dig>  it is interesting to note that phylogenetic comparison reveals these two genes to be more closely related to each other than to other idd genes from their own species and that zmidd <dig> and osidd <dig> appear to be the most closely related to the id1/sbid/osid cluster .

finally, id <dig> has a distinctive expression pattern that is not shared by the  <dig> zmidd genes examined here. so far, id <dig> is the only maize idd gene whose mrna is detected exclusively in immature leaves, thus leading to speculation that id <dig> regulates the transmission of leaf-derived floral inductive signals  <cit> . the finding that, similar to id <dig>  proteins encoded by the prospective id <dig> orthologs from rice  and sorghum  are localized to immature leaves exclusively is intriguing because it suggests that these genes may regulate flowering time in related grass species. genetic analysis of osid and sbid is required to confirm this possibility.

one mechanism to target the activity of a regulatory protein is to restrict its expression to a particular tissue. a recent study found that one member of the  <dig> gene cytokinin oxidase family in rice, osckx <dig>  had an expression pattern that differed from all other family members  <cit> . although other members of the family had similar enzymatic activity in reducing cytokinin levels, the higher level of osckx expression in high yielding rice is suggested to explain phenotypic differences correlated with high yield rice. similarly, the restriction of id <dig> expression to developing leaves of maize may be explained by a specific function of this putative regulatory protein in controlling leaf derived floral inductive signals. no maize idd genes examined here had an expression pattern similar to or restrictive as id <dig>  it is possible that one or more of the other zmidd genes that were not examined have expression patterns similar to id <dig>  however the degree of divergence of id <dig> from all other zmidd genes suggest that they might not perform the same function, even if they had similar expression patterns. this can be tested once probes for all zmidd genes are available. whether differences in the activity of each idd gene is the result of its expression or because of subtle differences in regulatory action might be revealed by further genetic analyses of the function of each gene.

origin of the id-domain gene family
eukaryotic transcription factors can be classified into two basic groups based on their origins; those common to all lineages , and those specific to a particular lineage that evolved novel functions to carry out particular developmental needs of the organisms  <cit> . the idd zinc finger proteins appear to be a hybrid of both types of transcription factor  <cit> . zinc finger proteins are found in all eukaryotic lineages, suggesting that they are derived from a common eukaryote ancestor. however, the zinc finger family of transcription factors is diverse and can be divided into many subgroups based on a common structural feature; i.e., cysteine and/or histidine residues in a configuration that facilitates protein folding such that each finger interacts with a particular nucleotide sequence. given the modular nature of zinc finger proteins, it is possible that during the course of evolution a "mixing and matching" of zinc finger units could occur to generate binding domains of a particular type. for example the constans family of transcription factors, some of which have an important role in photoperiod induced floral induction, appear to have a unique combination of zinc fingers  <cit> .

we suggest that the arrangement of zinc finger modules in the id domain has evolved to generate a class of zinc fingers that is unique to plants. that is, idd proteins are derived from common zinc finger domains and act together to form a plant lineage-specific regulatory family. in addition to two canonical zinc fingers, idd proteins also contain two unusual cchc fingers, one of which is related to a zinc finger found in the s. cerevisiae swi <dig> protein  <cit> . this combination of standard and unique zinc finger domains defines the idd family found in all plants.

CONCLUSIONS
maize id <dig> defines the idd gene family that is present in higher plants. analysis of the arabidopsis and rice genomes reveals  <dig> and  <dig> idd genes, respectively. therefore the highly conserved idd gene family is common to both monocots and dicots. from available genomic and est/cdna resources we have discovered  <dig> additional full-length idd genes in maize, indicating that a large portion of the maize gene space may be represented. within maize, expression of the id <dig> gene is limited to a particular tissue, whereas expression patterns of several zmidd genes are broader. phylogenetic comparison of idd genes reveals that id <dig> and putative id <dig> orthologs from rice and sorghum form a subgroup distinct from other idd genes. further, the finding that osid and sbid proteins, like id <dig>  are confined to immature leaf tissue during development supports the possibility that they have a similar function in regulating the floral transition in these species. overall, it seems likely that the zinc finger configuration of idd proteins was established in an ancestral plant species and has been maintained throughout evolution. the reason for the maintenance of the id-domain suggests a general, plant-specific function but, apart from for the role of maize id <dig> in regulating the transition to flowering, the functions of all other idd genes remain to be elucidated.
