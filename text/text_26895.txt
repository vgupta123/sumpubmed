BACKGROUND
in recent years palmitoylation has emerged as an important regulator of protein localization and function, particularly in neurons  <cit> . palmitoylation is the reversible addition of long chain fatty acids, typically palmitate, to proteins at cysteine residues  <cit> . it is mediated by dhhc-domain containing palmitoyl acyltransferases  that palmitoylate proteins at cysteine residues via a thioester bond  <cit> . many pats have been implicated in diseases of the nervous system, including huntington disease , an autosomal dominant fatal neurodegenerative disease; schizophrenia; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; alzheimer disease; and x-linked intellectual disability  <cit> .

palmitoylation is the only reversible lipid modification, and this reversibility is analogous to phosphorylation, where enzyme-mediated addition and removal of palmitate allows for rapid cycling of palmitate on some proteins, providing an additional level of regulation of localization and function  <cit> . indeed, in neurons, palmitoylation has been shown to regulate localization of many synaptic proteins. for example, palmitoylation of post-synaptic density protein  <dig>  is required for its synaptic localization, and its palmitoylation undergoes cycles of de/repalmitoylation that regulate psd <dig> nanoclusters within the synapse  <cit> . palmitoylation also regulates the synaptic insertion/removal of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor  subunits glua <dig> and glua <dig>  and of n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor  subunits glun2a and glun2b  <cit> .

huntingtin interacting protein  <dig>  is the most highly conserved of the  <dig> human pats. it palmitoylates many synaptic proteins, including cysteine string protein , glua <dig>  glua <dig>  psd <dig>  synaptosomal-associated protein  <dig> , synaptotagmin  <dig> , the large conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium bk channel  strex isoform, and the hd disease-causing protein huntingtin   <cit> . it has recently become more apparent that hip <dig> is an important regulator of synaptic function. indeed, hip <dig> knockdown reduces psd <dig> clustering in neurons  <cit>  and in drosophila melanogaster hip <dig> is required for csp targeting to synaptic vesicles and, in turn, pre-synaptic exocytosis  <cit> . interestingly, in an hd mouse model hip <dig> is less active  <cit>  and the constitutive hip14-deficient mouse  has behavioral, neuropathological, and synaptic dysfunction reminiscent of hd  <cit> .

the hip14
gt/gt mouse is a hypomorph expressing ~10% of endogenous hip <dig> protein  <cit>  and the phenotype is developmental, as neurodegeneration occurs during late embryogenesis. thus, we sought to determine the consequences of complete loss of hip <dig> in the adult animal and its effect on synaptic deficits and neuronal degeneration. an inducible hip14-deficient mouse model was generated, and hip <dig> deletion was induced in the young adult mouse.

RESULTS
generation of post-development hip14-deficient mice

hip <dig> “conditional knockout”  mice  were crossed to ubiquitously expressed tamoxifen -inducible cre recombinase -expressing transgenic mice  <cit> . hip <dig> deletion was induced in hip14
f/f;cre + mice at 6 weeks of age by tm treatment  to allow mice a month to recover from tm toxicity prior to any behavior testing performed at 3 months of age  <cit> .fig.  <dig> generation of hip <dig> conditional knockout mice. the targeting vector that was used is shown in . it was generated using pcr cloning of the 5′ and 3′ homology arms  and the deletion region  with the indicated restriction enzyme sites added by pcr and used for cloning into the targeting vector, such that loxp sites are oriented in the same direction up and downstream of the cko region. the deletion region, in gray, includes exon  <dig> and upstream and downstream intronic sequences to a total of  <dig>  kbp. the targeting vector also includes a positive neomycin  selection cassette flanked by flippase recognition target  sites and a negative diphtheria toxin a  selection cassette outside of the homology arms. the wild-type  allele is shown in  with the 5′ and 3′ homology arms and the cko region indicated. the recombined allele  is shown in . the neo cassette was removed during embryonic cell culture after targeting by electroporation with flp recombinase and negative selection with g <dig>  the knockout allele following expression of cre recombinase is shown in  where recombination between the loxp sites occurs by the action of cre leading to deletion of the cko region, including exon  <dig>  this deletion results in a frameshift mutation and multiple premature stop codons. the expression of hip <dig> mrna in the striatum, hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, spleen, liver, kidney, and heart in ihip14

f/f control mice relative to β-actin is shown in  . there was a 90% or greater decrease in hip <dig> mrna in ihip14

Δ/Δ mice. data were analyzed using student’s t test





hip <dig> mrna and protein levels were assessed at 10 days after the last injection and 6 weeks post-induction to assess deletion efficiency compared to hip14
f/f;cre– tm control mice . hip <dig> mrna and protein expression was decreased by >90% 10 days post-tm treatment in all brain regions and peripheral tissues tested . greater than 95% loss of hip <dig> protein was observed in the whole brain at 6 weeks post-tm treatment . these data indicate that deletion of hip <dig> in ihip14
Δ/Δ mice is >90% effective.

low body weight and hyperactivity in ihip14Δ/Δ mice
to assess overall health, ihip14
Δ/Δ mice were weighed at 3 months of age, approximately 7 weeks post-induction. both female and male ihip14
Δ/Δ mice were approximately 10% smaller than wild-type  vehicle -treated and ihip14
f/f control mice . to assess global nervous system and motor function, spontaneous activity was assessed during the dark phase. ihip14
Δ/Δ mice were hyperactive during exploration of a novel environment .fig.  <dig> decreased body weight and hyperactivity in 3-month old ihip14
Δ/Δ mice. a ~10% decrease in body weight of female  and male  ihip14
Δ/Δ mice compared to wt veh and ihip14
f/f mice was observed . spontaneous activity was assessed by infrared beam breaks during a 30-min exploration of a 27 × 27 ×  <dig>  cm box at 3 months of age. total distance traveled  and ambulatory time as assessed by consecutive beam breaks  were assessed. on both measures the ihip14
Δ/Δ mice were hyperactive compared to controls 




motor coordination and sensorimotor gating deficits in ihip14Δ/Δ mice
to determine if loss of hip <dig> in the adult mouse results in neurological dysfunction, motor function was assessed. motor coordination of ihip14
Δ/Δ mice was tested on rotarod and climbing tests  <cit> . ihip14
Δ/Δ mice had motor coordination deficits on the rotarod compared to control wt veh and ihip14
f/f mice . as the rotarod performance is a trained test where mice learn to stay on the rotarod, it is less sensitive to motor dysfunction than the spontaneous test of motor coordination: climbing  <cit> . there was also a dramatic reduction in the number of climbing events in these mice  but no change in the number of rearing events, indicative of motivation to explore the apparatus . taken together, these data indicate motor dysfunction.fig.  <dig> motor coordination and sensorimotor gating deficits in 3-month old ihip14
Δ/Δ mice. over three consecutive days, 3-month-old mice were trained on a fixed-speed rotarod and tested on an accelerating rotarod on the fourth day . the number of falls  and the latency to the first fall  were recorded. ihip14
Δ/Δ mice fell off the rotarod more  and sooner  both during training and during testing. mice were allowed to freely explore and climb a wire mesh container. ihip14
Δ/Δ mice climbed fewer times  but did not rear less  compared to control mice. pre-pulse inhibition  was measured as the percentage of decrease in the magnitude  of startle with a pre-pulse compared to the magnitude of startle without a pre-pulse. ihip14
Δ/Δ mice had a ppi deficit compared to controls 




schizophrenia and other neurological disorders were recently shown to be enriched for palmitoylated proteins  <cit> . pre-pulse inhibition  is a test of sensorimotor gating, partly mediated by the striatum  <cit> . ppi deficits are associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders as well as hd  <cit> . when a quieter tone  is played prior to a loud stimulus , mice with intact sensorimotor gating will startle less than they would to the loud startle stimulus alone  <cit> . ihip14
Δ/Δ mice showed impaired pre-pulse inhibition at all pre-pulse levels that was significant at  <dig>   <dig>  and 9 db above background with a trend at 16 db compared to control mice , indicating impaired sensorimotor gating and potential striatal dysfunction.

increased escape response and anhedonia in ihip14Δ/Δ mice
as it is becoming increasingly evident that palmitoylation is important in neuropsychiatric disorders  <cit> , the impact of loss of hip <dig> on psychiatric phenotypes such as depression and anxiety was assessed  <cit> . ihip14
Δ/Δ mice were tested in the porsolt forced swim test for depression . interestingly, ihip14
Δ/Δ mice spent dramatically less time immobile during forced swimming than controls . during behavior testing ihip14
Δ/Δ mice were observed to be very reactive to the experimenter and testing conditions, having explosive responses to both. thus, rather than truly reflecting an anti-depressive effect, these data in the forced swim test are consistent with the hyperactivity and reactivity to testing observed in these mice.fig.  <dig> three-month-old ihip14
Δ/Δ mice have increased escape response and display anhedonic-like behavior. ihip14
Δ/Δ mice spent significantly less time immobile in the forced swim test . mice were placed in an open field under bright lighting. ihip14
Δ/Δ mice explored the field to the same extent as the control mice  but spent less time in the center . ihip14
Δ/Δ mice spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze , explored the maze less , and dipped their heads off the edge of the open arms more  than controls. mice were placed in an enclosed box with a brightly lit side and a dark side. ihip14
Δ/Δ mice spent the same amount of the time in the light box as control mice . mice were allowed free access to a 2% sucrose solution and water over a 24-h period, and the total fluid consumption  was measured. ihip14
Δ/Δ mice had no change in total fluid intake  but had decreased preference for the sucrose solution 




anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the open field exploration test, a well-established test of anxiety-like behaviors in rodents  <cit> . ihip14
Δ/Δ mice explored the brightly lit open field to the same extent as control mice, as measured by distance traveled , but spent less time in the center of the field , suggesting an increase in anxiety-like behaviors in these mice.

to confirm anxiety in ihip14
Δ/Δ mice, the mice were tested using the elevated plus maze  test for anxiety  <cit> . surprisingly, the ihip14
Δ/Δ mice spent more time in the open arms of the epm than the control wt veh or ihip14
f/f mice , suggesting decreased anxiety, opposite to the findings from the open field testing. the ihip14
Δ/Δ mice did not explore the epm as much as the control mice , likely because they spent more time dipping their head off the edge of the open arms of the maze , again suggesting decreased anxiety. these data suggest an anxiolytic phenotype rather than the anxiogenic phenotype suggested by the open field exploration test. alternatively, the ihip14
Δ/Δ mice may be trying to escape the testing apparatus; i.e., they spend more time exploring the edges of the open field box trying to find a way out, and in the epm they dip their heads off the open arms trying to escape the maze. this interpretation would also be consistent with their reactivity to handling and testing and reduced time spent immobile in the forced swim test.

to separate anxiety-like behavior from increased escape response, a modified light-dark box test was designed that completely removed any possibility of escape, where one side was dark and the other side was brightly lit, and both sides were completely enclosed. the ihip14
Δ/Δ mice spent the same amount of time in the light box as the control mice . these data suggest ihip14
Δ/Δ mice are not anxious per se but have an increased escape response.

to delineate escape response from depressive-like behavior, the ihip14
Δ/Δ mice were tested using the sucrose preference test for anhedonia-like behavior , as anhedonia is a major symptom of depression  <cit> . the sucrose preference test is performed in the home cage with no experimenter present, thus eliminating the confound of increased escape response. the ihip14
Δ/Δ mice consumed the same amount of fluid  but had decreased preference for sucrose compared to the control mice , indicating anhedonia and suggesting a depressive-like phenotype.

increased forebrain weight, increased cortical volume, and decreased corpus callosum volume in ihip14Δ/Δ mice
to determine the effect of loss of hip <dig> in the adult mouse on brain morphology and neurodegeneration, neuropathological assessments were performed. increased brain weight was observed in ihip14
Δ/Δ mice . this increase was restricted to the forebrain , as there was no change in cerebellar weight compared to wt veh control mice . also, unexpectedly, there was no change in striatal volume in the ihip14
Δ/Δ mice compared to controls , but there was an increase in cortical volume  and a decreased corpus callosum volume, indicating loss of white matter  potentially due to axonal degeneration or loss of myelination.fig.  <dig> three-month-old ihip14
Δ/Δ mice have increased brain and forebrain weight, increased cortical volume, and decreased corpus callosum volume. ihip14
Δ/Δ mice have increased brain weight compared to control mice , larger forebrain weight , and unchanged cerebellum weight . brains were then sectioned and stained with neun to stain neurons, and striatal , cortical , and corpus callosum  volume were determined. no change in striatal volume was observed  in ihip14
Δ/Δ mice, but there was a significant increase in cortical volume  and decrease in corpus callosum volume . sections were stained with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein  or ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule  <dig>  to stain astrocytes  and microglia . there was increased staining intensity of gfap  and iba <dig> in ihip14
Δ/Δ cortex 




to understand what factors may account for the observed increase in cortical volume, astrocytes and microglia were assessed by glial fibrillary acidic protein  and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule  <dig>  staining intensity, respectively. there was a dramatic increase in both gfap  and iba <dig>  staining intensity in the cortex of ihip14
Δ/Δ mice compared to controls, indicating significant astrogliosis and microgliosis, respectively.

impaired synaptic transmission in the striatum of ihip14Δ/Δ mice
since palmitoylation has been implicated in localization of synaptic proteins and in synaptic signaling and hip <dig> was previously shown to be important for striatal physiology and striatal processing during motor behaviors  <cit> , the synaptic properties of medium-sized spiny neurons  in the striatum of ihip14
Δ/Δ mice were examined  by making current- and voltage-clamp recordings in the dorsal striatum. we observed no significant effect of loss of hip <dig> on either msn resting membrane potential or rheobase : the amount of current injection required to initiate action potential firing. membrane capacitance, an indirect measure of cell-surface area, was also similar between groups . thus, msn membrane potential, excitability, and cell size appear to be unaltered by loss of hip <dig> in adulthood.fig.  <dig> impaired synaptic transmission in ihip14
Δ/Δ msns.msns in the central dorsal striatum were whole-cell patch clamped in acute coronal slices from 3-month-old mice. a representative trace of current-clamp membrane potential responses to a series of current injections  is shown in . ihip14
Δ/Δ msns had the same resting membrane potential  , fired at the same rheobase current , and had the same membrane capacitance . ihip14
Δ/Δ mice had decreased frequency  but increased amplitude  of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents , representative traces are shown in . ihip14
Δ/Δ mice had increased paired pulse ratios , representative traces are shown in 




to assay excitatory synaptic function, ampar-mediated spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents  were recorded from msns held at –70 mv in the presence of picrotoxin, a γ-aminobutyric acid a  receptor antagonist. there was a significant decrease in the frequency and a significant increase in the amplitude of sepscs recorded from ihip14
Δ/Δ msns  compared to controls. these data demonstrate synaptic dysfunction in ihip14
∆/∆ mice and suggest a reduction in the number of excitatory synapses and/or a reduction in transmitter release probability with additional ampars at the synapses or more glutamate released per synaptic vesicle.

to assess transmitter release probability from cortical afferents onto msns in the striatum, a stimulating electrode was placed 200–250 μm dorsal to the recorded cell, various inter-pulse intervals were applied, and the paired pulse ratio  was calculated. msns from ihip14
Δ/Δ mice had increased pprs compared to msns from control mice . these data are indicative of a lower probability of transmitter release and are consistent with the reduction in sepsc frequency, further suggesting synaptic dysfunction.

reduced survival due to rapidly progressing paralysis in ihip14Δ/Δ mice
as mice were being aged for longitudinal behavior studies, a dramatic decrease in survival of ihip14
Δ/Δ mice, beginning at about 16 weeks of age or 10 weeks post-hip <dig> deletion, was observed . typically, all mice appeared healthy prior to sudden death. six mice were found with hind limb paralysis prior to being euthanized for other purposes. post-mortem examination of  <dig> ihip14
Δ/Δ mice revealed signs of paralysis in  <dig>  including splayed hind limbs and clenched front paws. one ihip14
Δ/Δ mouse found with hind limb paralysis was monitored by video . the paralysis progressed rapidly over 5 h beginning with the hind limbs. initially, the mouse did not appear distressed and was able to move around the cage and eat. paralysis progressed until the mouse could no longer move and it was euthanized. a second ihip14
Δ/Δ mouse was found almost completely paralyzed and was video monitored for a few minutes until it went into respiratory arrest and died . these data indicate that ihip14
Δ/Δ mice have dramatically reduced survival due to rapidly progressing paralysis and sudden death.fig.  <dig> reduced survival in ihip14

two ihip14
Δ/Δ mice survived past 20 weeks of age . one of these mice reached a humane endpoint due to wasting at 43 weeks of age and was euthanized. at the time of euthanasia, it weighed 30% less than its control littermates. the brain was harvested for biochemistry to assess hip <dig> protein levels to ensure complete loss of hip <dig>  indeed, negligible hip <dig> protein was detected, indicating that efficient recombination occurred in this mouse .

discussion
the most striking phenotype of the ihip14
∆/∆ mice is the rapidly progressing hind limb paralysis leading to sudden death. this was highly unexpected, as there is no survival deficit of hip14
gt/gt mice. hip <dig> is the most highly conserved pat, with 99% protein sequence identity between human and mouse and 88% between human and zebrafish as well as 100% conservation of the dhhc active site domain from human to chicken  <cit> . this high sequence conservation suggests an essential function for the protein, which is supported by the phenotype of ihip14
∆/∆ mice. the constitutive hip14-deficient hip14
gt/gt mouse has hd-like neurological deficits  <cit> ; thus, ihip14
∆/∆ mice were expected to develop a similar phenotype. however, the severe phenotype of ihip14
∆/∆ mice shows that hip <dig> is crucial for the life of the adult mouse. hip14
gt/gt mice develop early onset neurological disease, and these mice express 10% of the endogenous levels of hip <dig> in all cells  <cit> , whereas complete loss in >90% of cells in ihip14
∆/∆ adult mice causes a severe phenotype, including sudden death. thus, complete loss of hip <dig> is likely not compatible with survival. it will be interesting to see what happens if hip <dig> is fully deleted from conception. however, there may also be developmental compensation that occurs when hip <dig> is deleted from conception, likely by other pats, which cannot occur when hip <dig> is deleted in the adult animal.

the ihip14
∆/∆ mice have motor coordination deficits similar to those of hip14
gt/gt mice. the motor deficits are dramatic, particularly in the spontaneous climbing test. also, similar to hip14
gt/gt mice  <cit> , ihip14
∆/∆ mice have sensorimotor gating deficits. the ppi test assesses the ability to inhibit an unwanted motor response to a stimulus and is believed to be mediated by the striatum  <cit> . both motor dysfunction and ppi impairment suggest striatal dysfunction in the ihip14
∆/∆ mice.

the psychiatric phenotype of the ihip14
∆/∆ mice also suggests striatal dysfunction. the ihip14
∆/∆ mice are hyperactive and reactive to handling, which is consistent with the increased escape response observed during tests of anxiety and depression. this was confirmed when ihip14
∆/∆ mice performed similarly to control mice in the modified light-dark box test that eliminated any avenues for escape. however, anxiety and escape response are likely associated. thus, it is possible that they become anxious when they are unable to escape a novel environment  <cit> . overall, the increased escape response phenotype of ihip14
∆/∆ mice agrees with rodent striatal lesion models with enhanced escape response behavior, providing further evidence of an essential role for hip <dig> in striatal function  <cit> .

interestingly, ihip14
∆/∆ mice have increased forebrain weight due to microgliosis and astrogliosis in the cortex. this may be a downstream response to neuron or circuit dysfunction or may suggest a novel role for hip <dig> in glial cell function. also, although there is clear striatal dysfunction in ihip14
∆/∆ mice, there was no change in striatal volume, unlike the striatal atrophy observed in hip14
gt/gt mice  <cit> . one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that ihip14
∆/∆ mice die before sufficient striatal neuron death for detection by stereology has occurred. there was, however, a decrease in corpus callosum volume, suggesting decreased white matter and potentially axonal degeneration or demyelination.

further evidence for striatal dysfunction was apparent in the physiology of msns. although there is no change in membrane excitability or surface area in ihip14
Δ/Δ msns, they did display aberrant synaptic transmission. the increase in sepsc amplitude, decrease in sepsc frequency, and increased ppr suggest a lower probability of transmitter release but more ampars at excitatory synapses in the striatum and/or more glutamate released per synaptic vesicle to the same number of ampars. loss of palmitoylation at either palmitoylation site of glua <dig> or glua <dig> ampar subunits would increase their synaptic expression, which could contribute to these phenotypes  <cit> .

hip <dig> has been shown to be a “hub” protein with many interacting partners, and it shares many interactors  with htt, also a “hub” protein with many interactors  <cit> . in addition to being a pat, hip <dig> has also been shown to have other, non-pat-related, functions in map kinase signaling and magnesium/manganese transport . thus, the phenotype of these mice may be due to loss of palmitoylation of one or multiple crucial proteins, may result from loss of one of these other functions of hip <dig>  or may be caused by a combination of all these factors.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study, to our knowledge, to examine the “conditional knockout” of a dhhc pat and conclusively demonstrates that hip <dig> is essential for life and neuronal integrity. the ihip14
∆/∆ mice have a severe phenotype, different than that of the hip14
gt/gt mice, that results in sudden death, striatal dysfunction, and significant astrogliosis and microgliosis. these data highlight the importance of this pat to neurological function and suggest that palmitoylation is an essential protein modification.
