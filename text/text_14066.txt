BACKGROUND
sv <dig> proteins are integral transmembrane proteins expressed on synaptic dense core vesicles
 <cit>  but are also found on small clear vesicles containing neurotransmitters
 <cit> . cloning of the individual family members resulted in the identification of three different isoforms, sv2a
 <cit> , sv2b
 <cit>  and sv2c
 <cit> . the overall homology between the three rat isoforms is approximately 60%, with sv2a and sv2c being more similar to each other than sv2b
 <cit> . sv2a is ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system , neuroendocrine cells
 <cit>  and at the neuromuscular junction
 <cit> . sv2b is widely expressed in the brain
 <cit>  while sv2c has a more restricted distribution in the cns
 <cit> .

all sv <dig> isoforms are characterized by twelve transmembrane domains and three n-glycosilation sites in the intravesicular loop
 <cit> . sv <dig> proteins show similarities to members of the membrane transporter family and belong to the major facilitator superfamily , although the transported substrate has not been identified yet, and the molecular function of sv <dig> proteins remains elusive.

however, interactions with several synaptic proteins and hypothesis about their possible function have been reported. botulinum neurotoxin e was shown to interact with glycosilated forms of sv2a and sv2b
 <cit> . moreover, mahrhold et al. reported that the carboxy-terminal region of sv2c intravesicular domain mediates the botulinum neurotoxin a entry leading to its toxic effects
 <cit> .

several groups suggested a role of sv <dig> proteins in the regulation of presynaptic calcium concentration
 <cit> . in contrast, other authors have reported that sv <dig> protein activities are not related to a change in presynaptic calcium
 <cit> . however, there is evidence linking sv <dig> and calcium given the demonstrated interaction of sv <dig> with synaptotagmin considered to be the primary calcium sensor triggering calcium-dependent exocytosis
 <cit> . more recently, wan et al. used mouse rod bipolar cell preparations for direct biophysical studies measuring exocytosis and presynaptic calcium concentration in the mammalian central nervous system. in these neurons, sv2b is the main sv <dig> isoform expressed
 <cit> . as sv2b knockout  mice are viable
 <cit> , wan et al. were able to show in rod cells from sv2b ko animals, an elevation of ca2+ in nerve terminal both in resting and evoked presynaptic signals. this increase of ca2+ concentration results in changes in synaptic vesicle dynamics, synaptic plasticity, and synaptic strength.

sv2a, the major isoform in the cns has been linked with seizures and an epileptic phenotype. sv2a ko animals are characterized by the onset of epileptic seizures in early postnatal stage  leading to death around p15
 <cit> . moreover, it appears that sv2a expression decreases during epileptogenesis and chronically epileptic animals
 <cit>  as well as in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy
 <cit> . the therapeutic interest of sv <dig> proteins has been demonstrated with the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam. consecutively sv2a was identified as the molecular target of the previously described brain-binding site of levetiracetam
 <cit> . levetiracetam has a unique activity profile in animal models of seizure and epilepsy, favourable side-effect profile and straightforward pharmacokinetics
 <cit> . furthermore, brivaracetam, a novel antiepileptic drug  with higher sv2a affinity than levetiracetam
 <cit> , shows higher potency in several preclinical models of epilepsy
 <cit>  and is currently in clinical development
 <cit> .

in this study, we therefore systematically analyzed the expression of all sv <dig> isoforms during mouse brain development, to contribute to the understanding of their role during development and the onset of epileptic seizures.

RESULTS
immunohistofluorescence 
a systematic analysis of immunoreactivity for sv2a, sv2b and sv2c in several brain regions at various ages was performed. the results obtained for the selected telencephalic regions are summarized in table 
 <dig>  it was previously demonstrated that sv2a ko mice started to experience epileptic seizure at p <dig>  thus, the expression of all sv <dig> isoforms was analyzed at different key developmental steps, focusing on the developmental period around p <dig>  in grey matter of cortices, sv2a labelling was detectable from embryonic day  <dig> and reached maximum expression at post-natal day  <dig> . in olfactory bulb, the signal for sv2a reached a peak at embryonic day  <dig>  and remained stable in both fascicular and glomerular regions up to post-natal day  <dig> . in hippocampus, the labelling was detected earlier, at embryonic day  <dig>  but remained localized in the hilus of dentatus gyrus . the signal in dg seemed to decrease transiently around p <dig> and then increases in this region to reach maximum expression at p <dig>  in the ca <dig> region, low level of sv2a expression was detectable from p <dig> to reach maximum levels in older animals . at p <dig>  the signal remained stable in the olfactory bulbs, indicating that the decrease observed around p <dig> in hippocampus was not due to technical issues related to immunolabelling but truly reflects reduced levels of sv2a in hilus of dg at p <dig>  however, if we consider the growth of these two structures , one can also observe a higher expansion of the hippocampus than the olfactory bulb around p <dig>  in sub-cortical nuclei and in pallidal regions, sv2a signal appeared between embryonic day  <dig> and  <dig>  and rapidly reached high expression intensities. in these regions the signal also seemed to decrease around p <dig> but this decrease was less pronounced than what is observed in hippocampus. the results for the diencephalic, mesencephalic, pontic, bulbar and cerebellar regions are summarized in the additional files
 <dig> and
 <dig> 

the level of immunohistofluorescence has been evaluated based of the signal intensity in four classes : - for no labelling, +, ++ and +++ for respectively low, medium and intense fluorescence and brightness.

quantitative confocal immunofluorescence
an apparent reduction of sv2a immunolabeling was thus observed in hippocampus at p <dig>  which is exactly the period at which sv2a ko mice display epileptic seizures. in order to understand whether reduced sv2a expression in hippocampus – correlating with seizure appearance – was secondary to hippocampal growth which is pronounced at that age, we decided to quantify more precisely the expression of sv2a at post-natal day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in addition, expression of sv2b and sv2c was studied in the same regions . first, we used the fluorescence index quantified using confocal microscopy for ca <dig> region and hilus of dg. as signals for sv2a in olfactory bulbs remained stable from p <dig> to p <dig> , both signals in ca <dig> and hilus of dg were normalized using the signal in olfactory bulb to minimize the variation due to the immunolabeling technique itself . sv2a immunohistofluorescence increased gradually in the hilus of dg between post-natal days  <dig>  and  <dig>  while in ca <dig> region, the signal for sv2a increased only between p <dig> and p <dig>  albeit statistically significant the level of increase in the ca <dig> was substantially lower than the one observed in the hilus of dg. in contrast, the sv2b signal was not altered during this period both in ca <dig> and in the hilus of dg. finally, sv2c was not detected in the hippocampus at these three ages but expression was confirmed in striatum . therefore, the results obtained by quantified confocal microscopy for sv2a in hippocampus did not support the decrease of sv2a which was first suspected using a non-quantified approach.

laser microdissection and quantitative western blot
we further used quantitative western blot to determine levels for sv2a and sv2b at p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  hippocampus and olfactory bulbs were microdissected and proteins were extracted, quantified and analyzed by western blot using actin as reference for normalization between samples . both sv2a and sv2b expression increased between p <dig> and p <dig> in the entire hippocampus and remained stable between p <dig> and p <dig>  in contrast, sv2a and sv2b expression in olfactory bulbs remained constant between p <dig> and p <dig> but significantly increased between p <dig> and p <dig>  sv2c was expressed at very low level in hippocampus  and olfactory bulbs . in the striatum, where this isoform is highly abundant, an increase was observed between p <dig> and p <dig>  these data correlated with the results obtained using qrt-pcr on mrna extracted from hippocampus: sv2a mrna levels expressed in the hippocampus showed a significant increase between p <dig> and p <dig> and p <dig> respectively. similarly a significant increase of sv2b mrna level was detected in the hippocampus at p <dig> and p <dig> relative to mrna quantified at p <dig>  in contrast, the sv2c mrna expression was not altered and remained stable albeit at a substantially lower level relative to sv2a and sv2b at all time points . protein levels measured by western blot and mrna data analyzed by qpcr were consistent for majority of time points and hippocampal sub-regions except for the increase of sv2b mrna levels in the whole hippocampus between p <dig> and p <dig> with only a limited increases for sv2b protein expression in western blot.

to quantitatively assess expression of sv <dig> isoforms at p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> in ca <dig> and hilus of dg of the hippocampus, laser-microdissection was performed. the proteins were extracted and western blotting signals were quantified . using quantitative western blotting, we confirmed that in the hilus of dg, sv2a expression increased between p <dig> and p <dig> and between p <dig> and p <dig>  albeit statistical not significant for the earlier timepoint. in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus, the intensity of sv2a signal increased between p <dig> and p <dig> and remained stable at p <dig>  for sv2b, an increase of expressed protein was detected in the hilus of dg between p <dig> and p <dig> and between p <dig> and p <dig>  in the ca <dig> region, sv2b protein level increased between p <dig> and p <dig> but no significant difference between p <dig> and p <dig> as well as p <dig> and p <dig> was detected.

discussion
our study focuses on the expression of the three sv <dig> protein isoforms in the mouse developing brain from embryonic day  <dig>  to post-natal day  <dig> . we analyzed several regions in the central nervous system, focusing the analysis of the sv <dig> protein expression in telencephalic regions given the relationships of sv2a with epilepsy. interestingly, non quantitative immunofluorescence suggests a decrease of the sv2a signal in the hippocampus around p <dig> which is precisely the age at which epileptic seizures are observed in sv2a ko mice. a decrease of the sv2a signal was also observed using this semi-quantitative approach at p <dig> in various telencephalic regions , including the thalamus, as well the hypothalamus, the mesencephalon in the pontic and the bulbar regions suggesting potentially a technical reason for this reduction. however, this technical problem is unlikely as the decreased sv2a signal at p <dig> was not observed in other brain regions such as olfactory bulbs or in the cortical grey matter. interestingly, the growth of all these telencephalic structures are characterized by a rapid expansion at p <dig> given the myelinogenesis which takes place at that age
 <cit> . for this reason, we performed a precise quantification of the sv2a protein and mrna expression levels in various hippocampal regions around p <dig>  this precise quantification did not confirm the apparent reduction of sv2a at p <dig> observed by immunohistology. similarly, a systematic analysis of sv2b expression in various brain regions by the same methodological approach gave similar results: an apparent decreased expression of sv2b in hippocampus around p <dig>  which was not confirmed by the quantitative sv2b expression measurements. thus, we believe that this decrease in sv2a and in sv2b expression which is apparent for hippocampus, is a consequence of a phenomenon which is not related to the sv2a or sv2b expression per se but rather to the enlargement and growth of tissue as myelin appears at that age in these various mouse brain regions
 <cit> , potentially affecting the semi-quantitative immunohistological read out suggesting a decrease in sv2a or sv2b expression.

a more precise quantification of sv2a, sv2b and sv2c in whole hippocampus showed an increase in the expression of sv2a and sv2b between p <dig> and p <dig>  and a stabilization between p <dig> and p <dig>  while sv2c showed low expression at p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  majority of the protein quantification data were confirmed by mrna measurements using qpcr indicating elevated levels for sv2a and sv2b at later stages except for sv2b mrna which was increased between p <dig> and p <dig>  the increase of sv2a expression in the hippocampus observed by confocal microscopy measurements, between p <dig> and p <dig> seems to be restricted exclusively to the ca <dig> region. indeed, we confirmed a higher sv2a expression by western blot in the ca <dig> after laser micro-dissection. the sv2a expression in hippocampus is thus different than the sv2b expression which progressively increases in ca <dig>  an observation that could possibly explain that the absence of sv2a in ko mice at that age is followed by onset of epileptic seizures onset, while the absence of sv2b has no effect on seizure susceptibility
 <cit> . in this context, as presynaptic calcium regulation by sv <dig> proteins have been hypothesized by studying sv2b ko mice, the question of the exact role of sv2a, the target of the anti epileptic drug levetiracetam, however remains despite intense research elusive.

we thus observed a sharp increase of sv2a expression in ca <dig> region at p <dig>  the age of onset of epileptic seizures in sv2a ko animals
 <cit> . sv2a is expressed as early as neurons differentiated, the question of the appearance of seizures only at a late developmental stage has to be addressed. on the other hand, the role of sv2a in seizure susceptibility could be linked to its presence in inhibitory neurons. when the seizures appear, gaba is changing from being an excitatory to an inhibitory transmitter
 <cit> . it was previously described, that p <dig> is the earliest developmental stage where a long-term potentiation in ca <dig> region in rats can be demonstrated suggesting an increase of synaptic plasticity at that age
 <cit> . more recently, it has been demonstrated that levetiracetam controls more efficiently epileptic seizures when sv2a is highly expressed in tissue surrounding resected glioma
 <cit> . this observation together with our study suggests that a high level of sv2a expression is required to protect animals from epileptic seizures and for the efficacy of levetiracetam. this conclusion is consistent with the observation that sv2a  heterozygous mice are more prone to seizures in a range of various acute models as well as accelerated epileptogenesis
 <cit> . starting at p <dig>  an age characterized by myelinogenesis in several telencephalic regions and by synaptic plasticity in ca <dig> region, a minimum sv2a level is required to protect animals from seizures. this potential “protective” effect of sv2a increased expression in ca <dig> at p <dig> is not compensate by sv2b either because sv2a exhibit specific function different to sv2b or because sv2b expression does not increase in hippocampus at the same age. in this context, it can be speculated that levetiracetam could potentially increase the sv2a activity, whatever this activity is and consequently, thereby decreasing epileptic seizures. this putative role of levetiracetam is also sustained by the observation that brivaracetam, a compound which binds sv2a with a higher affinity than levetiracetam, exhibits more potent anticonvulsant properties in various acute epilepsy models
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we study the pattern of sv <dig> isoforms expression during mouse brain development. by non-quantitative and quantitative approaches, we show an increased expression of sv2a restricted to the ca <dig> region at p <dig>  these findings provide new elements to better understand the role of sv2a in the epileptic seizures.
