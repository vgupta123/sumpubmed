BACKGROUND
minimising brain injury following stroke is a critical clinical goal both to improve patient quality of life and to lessen the social and economic impacts of this devastating disorder. currently, the most effective stroke therapy is to restore cerebral blood flow to a blocked artery using tpa and thrombectomy . however, the current therapeutic window for coupled tpa ± thrombectomy therapy is so narrow  that the majority of stroke patients are unable to receive the treatment. moreover, for those that do, up to 7 % develop intracranial haemorrhage as a complication. in addition, tpa ± thrombectomy is only available to patients having ready access to a hospital that has the facilities required for performing the procedures. other treatments are only suitable for a small proportion of patients  or provide only modest benefit   <cit> . as a consequence, while recent improvements in stroke therapy have been made, these have been limited and it is clear that there is urgent need for new, more widely applicable neuroprotective therapies that can be applied to stroke patients early by ambulance paramedics, in hospital emergency departments, and in remote locations away from tertiary hospitals. additionally, any treatment that might improve the safety, therapeutic window and neuroprotective outcomes for tpa ± thrombectomy would be of great clinical significance.

against the backdrop of the limited nature of current therapies, we have recently demonstrated that poly-arginine  peptides have potent neuroprotective properties in in vitro injury models that mimic the effects of stroke . we have also established that poly-arginine peptides, as well as other arginine-rich peptides, including tat and penetratin belonging to a class of peptide with cell penetrating properties also possess intrinsic neuroprotective properties . moreover, our in vitro data show that neuroprotective potency is enhanced with increasing arginine content   <cit> . as evidence of their clinical applicability, we have demonstrated that the poly-arginine r9d significantly reduces infarct volume in vivo following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion  in the rat  <cit> . a recent report  <cit>  has also demonstrated that poly-arginine  <dig>  containing peptides are neuroprotective in an in vivo retinal ganglion nmda excitotoxicity model.

the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides in vitro and in vivo suggest that they may have potential as a neuroprotective therapy for stroke patients. to further investigate the efficacy of poly-arginine peptides in vivo and given the positive results obtained with the r9d peptide, in this study we assess the neuroprotective efficacy of the longer l-isoform poly-arginine peptides r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> when administered 30 min after permanent mcao. in addition, unlike in our earlier r9d trial, this study assesses functional outcomes using three behavioural tests as well as infarct volume to gain an understanding of the functional consequences of neuroprotection.

RESULTS
physiological and infarct volume measurements
physiological measurements before or during surgery confirmed the absence of any significant differences between animal treatment groups . data on the mean total infarct volumes and representative ttc stained coronal brain slices for each treatment group are presented in fig.  <dig>  these results show that the r <dig> peptide significantly reduced infarct volume . the r <dig> peptide also reduced infarct volume , but not to a statistical significant extent . by contrast, the r <dig> peptide had no effect on infarct volume. rostral to caudal topographic analysis of infarcts in brain slices revealed that the r <dig> peptide significantly reduced brain injury in coronal slices  <dig>  and  <dig>  . in addition, the r <dig> peptide significantly reduced brain injury in coronal slice  <dig> .table  <dig> physiological parameters for experimental animals used in study

there were three post-treatment animal deaths that occurred the day following surgery, one in the vehicle and two in the r12-treated animals. while the animal deaths could be directly related to stroke severity and/or treatment, the exact cause of the deaths could not be precisely determined on autopsy.

functional outcome assessment
neurological scores using the modified bederson’ scale for each treatment group are presented in fig.  <dig>  while neurological scores did not differ statistically between groups, the vehicle control group score was higher  than any of the scores for the peptide treatment groups , indicative of a possible positive treatment effect. results for the rota-rod assessment for each treatment group are presented in fig.  <dig>  results were highly variable within groups and no significant differences were detected.fig.  <dig> neurological grading scores 24 h after permanent mcao  for saline  and peptide  treatment groups. assessment was performed immediately before euthanasia. lines on graph indicate range and median for neurological scores

at experiment end, all treatment groups recorded a loss in weight, with the greatest weight loss occurring in the r <dig> peptide treatment group .fig.  <dig> weight loss at 24 h after permanent mcao for saline  and peptide  treatment groups. values are mean ± sd; *p <  <dig>  when compared to the vehicle control group



discussion
in a previous study, we demonstrated that the poly-arginine peptide r9d could reduce infarct volume by 20 % when administered intravenously 30 min post-mcao  <cit> , however no functional assessment was performed. the present study extends this previous study to include the poly-arginine peptides r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> and explores their capacity to reduce infarct volume and improve functional outcomes when administered intravenously 30 min post-mcao. whereas r <dig> had no effect on infarct volume, r <dig> significantly reduced infarct volume  and there was a trend towards reduced infarct volume with r <dig> . importantly, all peptide treatments displayed a trend towards improvement in one or more of the neurological functional tests. whilst the level of infarct volume reduction was modest , this most likely reflects the severity of the stroke model used in this particular study where up to 90 % of the affected brain hemisphere is infarcted by the stroke. it is also likely that the modest reductions in infarct volume, stroke severity and 24-h endpoint coupled with the small animal numbers used explain why the trend towards improvements in functional outcomes was not statistically significant. despite the modest effects of the poly-arginine peptides following permanent mcao, it is still possible that these peptides have potential clinical application, especially in less severe forms of stroke, stroke associated with cerebral reperfusion treatments  and haemorrhagic stroke.

with respect to neuroprotective efficacy, further research is required to determine the optimal dose of the peptides to reduce infarct volume. it was particularly surprising that the r <dig> peptide did not have any affect on infarct volume reduction, despite showing comparable neuroprotective efficacy to r <dig> when assessed in an in vitro neuronal glutamate excitotoxicity model  <cit> . the reason why no observable neuroprotection was obtained for r <dig> is at present unknown, but it is possible that a higher or lower dose may be more effective than the dose used in the current study. studies are currently underway in our laboratory to more definitively address questions surrounding effective dosage for a range of poly-arginine peptides in the in vivo stroke model.

the present study did not investigate the mechanism of action of peptides, but in previous studies we have shown that poly-arginine peptides have the capacity to reduce excitotoxic glutamic acid-induced calcium influx in cultured cortical neurons  <cit> . based on this finding, as well as the findings of other studies, we have hypothesised that these peptides have the capacity to inhibit calcium influx by causing the internalisation of cell surface structures such as ion channels and thereby reduce the toxic neuronal calcium entry that occurs after excitotoxicity and cerebral ischemia. we have speculated that due to the cell penetrating properties of arginine-rich peptides, including putative “neuroprotective peptides” fused to the arginine-rich carrier peptide tat, ion channel receptor internalisation occurs during neuronal endocytic uptake of the peptides  <cit> . evidence that supports our hypothesis includes studies demonstrating that arginine-rich peptides:  interfere with the function of nmda  and vanilloid receptors  <cit> , voltage gated calcium channels  and the sodium calcium exchanger  <cit> ;  cause internalisation or reduced surface expression of neuronal ion channels  <cit> ; and  can induce the endocytic internalisation of epidermal growth factor receptor and tumour necrosis factor receptors in hela cells  <cit> .

in support of the poly-arginine neuroprotective findings in the present study, a recent report  <cit>  has confirmed the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine  <dig>  containing peptides and other arginine-rich peptides  in an in vivo retinal ganglion nmda excitotoxicity model. moreover, the study also provides evidence for an additional neuroprotective mechanism associated with maintenance of mitochondrial function and integrity.

studies in our laboratory to confirm peptide-induced internalisation of cell surface receptors and other neuroprotective mechanisms are in progress. while we have demonstrated that arginine-rich peptides have the capacity to reduce excitotoxic calcium influx, it will be important to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of peptide neuroprotective mechanism of action. nevertheless our findings indicate poly-arginine peptides have both in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective properties and warrant further evaluation in different stroke models and other acute brain injury disorders.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings of this study further validates the neuroprotective properties of poly-arginine peptides , highlights their status a new class of neuroprotective agent and provides justification for their evaluation in different stroke models and other acute brain injury disorders. the findings also further question the mechanism of action of the many reported “neuroprotective peptides” fused to arginine-rich carrier peptides, which are thought to act through interaction with specific intracellular proteins, but which our data suggest may act through a common mechanism of action relating to peptide arginine content and positive charge.
