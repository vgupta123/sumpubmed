BACKGROUND
investigating the evolution of metabolic pathways requires tracing back how the enzymes that catalyze successive steps have evolved to perform specific chemical reactions  <cit> . enzyme families are grouping all homologous gene products descending from a common ancestor by speciation and/or gene duplication. an increasingly prevailing model  <cit>  postulates that present-day enzyme families and superfamilies are the result of the progressive divergence of ancestral proteins endowed with a promiscuous function. contrary to the classical model proposed by ohno  <cit> , it is anticipated that innovation  preceded gene duplication and functional divergence of the paralogous copies by descent with modification  <cit> . to explain the appearance of many closely related families which group into mechanistically diverse superfamilies, glasner et al.  <cit>  have proposed to distinguish two degrees of promiscuity: shared chemistry  and substrate binding . more and more data suggest that substrate ambiguity, first defined in the classical patchwork model of jensen  <cit> , rather than catalytic promiscuity  <cit> , is the main road which facilitates divergence of most enzyme families  <cit> .

in a recent paper  <cit> , we studied the evolutionary history of dihydroorotase , which catalyzes the third step of pyrimidine biosynthesis, as well as that of its homologues, all members of the cyclic amidohydrolase superfamily  <cit> . we found that hydantoinase/dihydropyrimidinase, involved in degradation of pyrimidines  <cit> , and allantoinase, a major enzyme of purine catabolism  <cit> , are evolutionarily closer to the ancestral type of dhoase  than to the largely derived dhoases belonging to type ii and type iii. thus, although all these homologues perform the same hydrolytic cleavage of a c-n bond in related molecules  <cit> , there is no direct correlation between their respective molecular and cellular functions  <cit> . however, we observed that the catalyses carried out by these different homologues, defining related families which group into mechanistically diverse superfamilies, are performed on molecules displaying close chemical similarities .

to examine further the observed coupling of enzyme homology and chemical similarity, we investigated the neighbouring steps in the respective pathways in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. in this paper, we identify that successive reactions display similar chemistry. these mechanistically-related reactions are often catalyzed by homologous enzymes. these homologues diverge in their molecular and cellular functions while maintaining a similar chemical mechanism in their catalytic process. this detection of series of similar catalysis made by succeeding enzyme families suggested some modularity  <cit>  in the architecture of central metabolism.

this led us to propose the term reaction module to describe such related suites of catalyses found in parallel pathways that are alignable at the level of their chemically similar steps.

we demonstrate further the importance of this concept in the characterization of a new route in purine catabolism. after a bioinformatic discovery of a putative ureidoglycine carbamoyltransferase  activity, we present experimental data supporting the idea that ugtcase is likely involved in such an alternative metabolic route.

RESULTS
comparing dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and finding new putative dehydrogenase families
figure  <dig>  box  <dig> illustrates that dhoase, involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis , is homologous both to hydantoinase/dihydropyrimidinase  involved in degradation of pyrimidines , and to allantoinase  a major enzyme of purine catabolism . figure  <dig>  box  <dig> underlines the similar chemical reactions performed by these different homologues on similar substrates  <cit> . for instance, carbamoyl-aspartate  has a similar structure to n-carbamoyl-beta-aminoisobutyrate  and n-carbamoyl-beta -alanine . interestingly, figure  <dig>  box  <dig> shows further similarities in the chemical reactions carried out by the enzymes that are active in the subsequent step of pyrimidine metabolism in both anabolic  and catabolic  directions. indeed, the dihydroorotate is transformed anabolically into orotate by the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase , in a process similar to the catabolic transformation  of uracil or thymine to dihydrouracil or dihydrothymine by their respective dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenases . to improve our knowledge of the evolutionary mechanisms leading to the establishment of such related adjacent reactions , we looked further at the evolutionary relationships between dhodases and dhpdases.

the methodological approach described previously by barba et al.  <cit>  was used to build an accurate msa that faithfully reflects the evolutionary relationships between so many homologues displaying a large structural diversity. moreover, the deluge of more and more varied proportions of close and distantly related amino acid sequences released by the advances in genomics makes it increasingly difficult to reconstruct an up to date phylogenetic tree. to meet these challenges, we set up a two-stage procedure summarized in methods. first, we define a seed alignment of the amino acid sequences of pyrd , prea  and pyda  that have been structurally characterized. this limited set of representative sequences was build in order to be sufficiently consistent and biologically meaningful to reflect accurately the structural and functional diversity of the different families of dhodases and dhpdases. then, as described in methods, we added progressively to the seed alignment their homologues found in uniprotkb  <cit> , to obtain an optimal multiple sequence alignment  of the whole superfamily . figure  <dig> shows a simplified view  of the topology of the phylogenetic tree obtained from this msa, confirming that pyrd homologues are clustered in two main subtrees . these subtrees correspond to the multimeric cytoplasmic dhodases type  <dig> and the monomeric membrane-bound dhodases type  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the sequences of dhodases  <dig> can be further separated into two monophyletic subclasses: the minority of pyrd subunits that form homodimers, defining a subtree containing all dhodases 1a, the majority of pyrd proteins that form heterotetramers with pyrk, defining the subtree dhodases 1b. members of 1b subfamily share a common ancestor with four other clades:  the variant 1s where pyrd molecules form heterotetramers with a subunit analogous to pyrk , first described in the archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus <cit>  and found later in other archaea;  its sister subtree contains three clades, including a monophyletic group corresponding to pyda and to prea, forming heterotetramers with pydx and pret, respectively;  diverging before these dhpdases, we found two clades of unknown dehydrogenases corresponding to newly discovered families which we provisionally call x <dig> and x <dig> 

a gene coding for x <dig> was found in  <dig> bacterial species  as a close neighbour of a gene annotated as encoding a pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase. moreover, in  <dig> out of these  <dig> species, the immediate neighbour to this pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase is a gene homologous to pret, encoding the ferredoxin part of the complex prea-pret of the escherichia coli dhpdase  <cit> . in the remaining species defining the x <dig> subtree, this pret-like gene is present but is not in the same transcriptional unit as the gene for dehydrogenase x <dig>  since e. coli is found to contain four pret paralogues but only one copy of prea, one may guess by analogy that x <dig> could be the partner of one of these pret paralogues. this should form a complex with the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase in order to dehydrogenate an uncharacterized component that may be similar to dihydropyrimidines or hydantoin.

figure 3a summarizes the phylogenetic profile of the dehydrogenase x <dig> homologues and neighbouring genes in various organisms. e. coli is used as reference although there is – paradoxically – no dhase x <dig> homologue in this model organism. we found that the x <dig> homologue is often found together with homologues of hyua  encoding a d-phenylhydantoinase ; ygew encoding a hypothetical carbamoyltransferase ; ygey encoding a uncharacterized peptidase belonging to family m20; ygfl encoding an uncharacterized metal dependent aminohydrolase ssna; xdha, xdhb, and xdhc encoding the three subunits of xanthine deshydrogenase xdhase; ygfu encoding a xanthine/uracil permease, and, finally; yqea encoding a carbamate kinase-like protein. figure 3b further underlines, in the case of e. coli, that several of these gene products are known to be associated by protein-protein interactions as published in string database  <dig>   <cit>  while being involved in purine salvage  <cit> . the gene cluster ygew to yqea  linked to ygfl/ssna  delineate a conserved network of syntenic genes where some of the nodes  are linked to genes encoding carbamoyltransferases  and the carbamate kinase . thus, figure  <dig> suggests that dehydrogenase x <dig> homologues are associated with conserved genes potentially involved in pyrimidine but also purine catabolism. to explore such an unexpected link between pyrimidine and purine metabolism, we inspected further the reactions described in figure  <dig>  box  <dig>  these three parallel reactions appear to be chemically similar in terms of substrate and product structures. moreover, the allantoate amidohydrolase aahase  and n-carbamoyl-beta-aminoacid hydrolase  involved in pyrimidine and purine catabolism, respectively, appear to be homologous. this is not the case, however, for the aspartate carbamoyltransferase , which is involved in pyrimidine anabolism . we thus looked for a possible undetected reaction module in the purine pathway  by searching for a putative biochemical reaction that could be similar to that of the atcase . accordingly, we re-examined the phylogeny of the whole superfamily of carbamoyltransferases to look for uncharacterized homologues that could be involved in such an undetected reaction module.

updating the carbamoyltransferase phylogenetic tree
the methodological approach previously described  <cit>  and summarized above and in methods, was used to reconstruct an accurate evolutionary tree of the carbamoyltransferase superfamily. figure  <dig> shows a simplified view  of this updated tree. as in the trees we reconstructed previously, with far less sequences  <cit> , there is a clear separation between the ornithine carbamoyltransferases  and the atcases . however, the huge increase in the number of sequences brings with it three notable features.  the previously described otcase alpha and beta subfamilies appear now to be partially intermingled.  the putrescine carbamoyltransferases  form a monophyletic group that currently branches inside this otcase subtree. this evolutionary location appears to be biologically significant since it has been recently demonstrated that the ptcase synthesized by listeria monocytogenes is actually a bifunctional enzyme, catalyzing the decarbamoylation of either citrulline or carbamoylputrescine  <cit> . this depends on growth conditions at low ph and when expressed as a virulence factor  <cit> . in addition, the recent determination of the 3d structure of ptcases confirms the evolutionary inclusion of ptcases among otcases  <cit> .  the two families of atcases  we described previously  <cit>  still form two monophyletic subtrees corresponding to different quaternary structures  <cit> .

however, we now find, at the root of the atc ii subtree, a small polyphyletic subgroup which is composed of uncharacterized proteins. we call them pseudo-atcases since these paralogues - annotated as atcases in public databases - can be simply discriminated from the authentic atcases found in the same organism as detailed below . for example, in the case of rhodopirellula baltica, it is easy to distinguish the gene rb <dig>  encoding a genuine atcase , and found next to the gene rb <dig>  encoding a dhoase , from its paralogue rb <dig>  encoding the pseudo-atcase , and located in a completely different context .

the structural motifs specific for each subgroup of pseudo-atcases are in bold.

characterizing the pseudo-atcases
figure  <dig> shows that pseudo-atcases can be differentiated into three evolutionarily-defined subgroups using their closest homologue, the pyrococcus abyssi authentic atcase, as the outgroup. table  <dig> shows that this phylogenetic differentiation is also well supported by major differences, defined using the e. coli atcase sequence as a reference, in the two structural motifs located in the c-terminal part . the first motif, corresponding to h265-p <dig>  distinguishes each group of pseudo-atcases from all the other carbamoyltransferases, while the second motif r230-q <dig>  distinguishes each group of pseudo-atcases from the genuine atcases. moreover, pseudo-atcases contain, at their n-terminal region, two structural motifs , and h135-q <dig>  in the e. coli atcase sequence) that are highly conserved in the whole superfamily as a carbamoyltransferase signature.

additionally, the phylogenetic differentiation of each of the three subgroups of pseudo-atcases is confirmed by a distinctive gene context . in subgroup  <dig> , the gene encoding the pseudo-atcase is adjacent to a homologue of the e. coli ygew gene. ygew  <cit>  is a carbamoyltransferase which belongs to a group sharing a common ancestor with the aotcases  <cit>  and sotcases  <cit>  , but its true physiological role remains elusive  <cit> . in nocardioides, the adjacent downstream genes are xdha, xdhb and xdhc, together encoding a putative heterotrimeric xanthine dehydrogenase , and then a gene encoding a putative phenylhydantoinase hyua  <cit> . such gene association is reminiscent of the specific context of x <dig> family  even if there is no detectable x <dig> homologue in nocardioides sp. js <dig> 

members of the subgroup  <dig> pseudo-atcases are found in marine bacterial species. the encoding gene is part of a conserved syntenic block containing on one side a gene encoding a na+ symporter  and on the other side a gene encoding a putative asparaginase. in nearly all cases, this cluster is adjacent to a gene annotated as encoding a putative deiminase, which is most probably an n-carbamoyl-l-amino acid amidohydrolase  involved in hydantoin metabolism  <cit> .

the three species defining subgroup  <dig> exhibit a block of genes directly involved in purine metabolism, namely a carbamate kinase and an allantoinase, next to the pseudo-atcase . moreover, the gene context of rubrobacter xylanophilus pseudo-atcase rxyl_ <dig>  is particularly intriguing since it includes a gene cluster composed of several operons involved in purine degradation. the operon encompassing genes rxyl_ <dig> to rxyl_ <dig>  is implicated in successive steps of degradation to allantoate. xanthine dehydrogenase genes  are found upstream of this operon, while genes involved in the degradation of glyoxylate to d-glycerate  are located downstream in a third transcription unit .

deducing a novel carbamoyltransferase activity in a reaction module involved in purine degradation
the degradation process of allantoin to glyoxylate may involve one of several possible enzymes, namely, allantoicase, allantoate amidohydrolase, ureidoglycine amidohydrolase, ureidoglycolatase, and ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase  <cit> . importantly, however, we could not detect in the r. xylanophilus genome  any gene encoding the catalytic step corresponding to any of these enzymes. this suggested the possibility that rxyl_ <dig> and its neighbours  could play a role in this pathway. accordingly, we searched for possible reaction modules composed of chemically similar substrates/products through the comparison of purine catabolism , pyrimidine catabolism , and pyrimidine biosynthesis .

figure  <dig>  box  <dig> shows the functional similarities of atcase with the pyrimidine catabolic n-carbamoyl-l-amino acid amidohydrolase  and the purine catabolic allantoate amidohydrolase   <cit> . this suggests that the product of the rxyl_ <dig> gene may play a role as a carbamoyltransferase to functionally replace the aahase. in addition, rxyl_ <dig> is followed by rxyl_ <dig>  a gene annotated as encoding a carbamate kinase . consequently, we propose to reclassify the pseudo-atcase rxyl_ <dig> as an ureidoglycine carbamoyltransferase , which would catalyze the reaction: allantoate + pi < = > ureidoglycine + carbamoyl-phosphate in r. xylanophilus .

indirect evidence that rxyl_ <dig> has a ureidoglycine carbamoyltransferase activity
although a reaction module transforming allantoate to ureidoglycine appeared to be the most logical reaction that we are looking for, we could not exclude the alternative possibility of a promiscuous carbamoyltransferase activity normally involved in purine degradation, being responsible for transformation of allantoate to glyoxylate. to address this point, we quantified the chemical similarity of all the potential substrates and products of rxyl_ <dig> with that of atcase, i.e., aspartate and carbamoyl-aspartate , using chemmine  <cit> . figure 7a shows the dendrogram obtained using the tanimoto coefficient  to compare all potential carbamoylated substrates from purine catabolism , as well as those from pyrimidine catabolism , with pyrimidine anabolism . likewise, a second dendrogram  was obtained by comparing the same decarbamoylated counterparts as potential products , dihydrouracil , dihydroorotate , oxamate, aspartate, and ureidoglycine). both dendrograms and their corresponding deduced heatmaps show that among all possible compounds usable as respective substrate/product couples of the predicted ugtcase, allantoate  and ureidoglycine  are the most similar to aspartate and carbamoyl-aspartate . these similarities are underlined by a double arrow in the heatmaps and framed in the dendrograms . therefore, it becomes chemically legitimate, in the case of r. xylanophilus, to substitute the aahase molecular function  by that of the predicted ugtcase  in order to perform the cellular function transforming allantoate into ureidoglycine. noticeably, such a chemical closeness of rxyl_ <dig> with atcase supports the phylogenetic proximity and sequence similarity of the suggested ugtcase with genuine atcases in the frame of our reaction module concept.

experimental validation that rxyl_ <dig> has a ureidoglycine carbamoyltransferase activity
to ascertain the bioinformatic deduction that rxyl_ <dig> is really an ugtcase, the rxyl_ <dig> gene was cloned into a pbad expression vector . unexpectedly, the sequencing of plasmid pcec <dig> revealed several mismatches between the cloned orf sequence and the published genomic sequence of r. xylanophilus dsm <dig> . an extended dna fragment encompassing the orf rxyl_ <dig> was generated by two independent pcr reactions, sequenced, and this confirmed the sequence of the cloned rxyl_ <dig> .

recombinant his-tagged enzyme was purified to near-homogeneity by a three-step procedure including heat-treatment, metal affinity chromatography and molecular sieving . sds-page showed a subunit molecular mass of 37 kda but also a major band at 80 kda . the western blot analysis of purified enzyme  pointed out that it corresponds to a dimeric state of rxyl_ <dig>  such phenomenon was already reported for other thermophilic enzymes  <cit> . the activity of the purified enzyme was examined in the physiological, catabolic direction, i.e. the phosphorolysis of allantoate. since the equilibrium of the reaction catalyzed by carbamoyltransferases strongly favours the carbamoylation direction, in vitro studies of the catabolic reaction require the removal of one of the products formed. this can be achieved by using arsenate instead of phosphate  <cit>  or by coupling the reaction in vivo to that of a carbamate kinase, or an anabolic carbamoyltransferase. in this work, the e. coli otcase, purified as described previously  <cit>  was used in the presence of ornithine to convert the carbamoyl phosphate produced by the phosphorolysis of allantoate to citrulline .

to assay if the purified recombinant protein had a carbamoyltransferase activity, we first examined its ability to catalyze the arsenolytic cleavage of allantoate . importantly, since ureidoglycine, the putative product of the reaction, is thermally unstable, assays were performed with an incubation time not exceeding 5 min. . the amino content in the reaction mixture was immediately analyzed by reverse phase hplc after pre-column derivatization with o-phtaldialdehyde . one prominent peak, corresponding to ureidoglycine , was obtained after the enzyme was incubated at 37°c with allantoate and arsenate. after incubation at 60°c , only a small amount of ureidoglycine was observed, probably due to the lability of this product. ureidoglycine formation was observed when ugtcase was incubated with allantoate and arsenate, but not in the absence of arsenate, excluding the possibility of enzymatic hydrolysis of allantoate .

the physiological reaction catalyzed by ugtcase, namely the phosphorolysis of allantoate, was then analyzed by coupling with purified e. coli otcase to prove that carbamoyl phosphate was effectively formed in the reaction. the citrulline produced in the coupled assay was quantified by reverse phase hplc after pre-column derivatization with o-phtaldialdehyde. table  <dig> demonstrates that carbamoyl phosphate was indeed produced. comparison of the activities at both 37° and at 60°c showed that ugtcase was much more active at 60°c, as expected for a thermophilic enzyme .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have substantiated the potency of the concept of the reaction module to unravel undisclosed functional relationships in central metabolism and to discover the actual function of misannotated proteins  <cit> , especially when coupled with an informative gene context. the so-called pseudo-atcases  were found to be such an example of uncharacterized paralogues when we demonstrated they are unrelated to authentic atcases . using our conceptual approach, we have deduced and experimentally proved that the rxyl_ <dig> protein, the pseudo-atcase detected in the extremophile r. xylanophilus <cit> , is an ugtcase involved in the degradation of allantoin to ureidoglycine .

by analogy with steps observed in other species  <cit> , we further suggest that this reaction is part of a new route of purine catabolism, where ureidoglycine is then degraded by the carbamate kinase rxyl_ <dig> to produce carbamoyl-phosphate . moreover, spontaneous degradation of ureidoglycine at 60°c  would provide eventually glyoxylate . we propose that rxyl_ <dig>  adjacent to rxyl_ <dig> and rxyl_ <dig>  also plays a crucial role in this newly described pathway . in fact, rxyl_ <dig> has been annotated as an asparaginase-like enzyme in the r. xylanophilus genome . in contrast, gravenmade et al.  <cit>  claimed that allantoate amidohydrolase isolated from streptococcus allantoicus could hydrolyze allantoate to ureidoglycolate with the release of co <dig> and nh3+. in this case, aahase is expected to produce ureidoglycine, which is later transformed into ureidoglycolate by an ureidoglycine aminohydrolase. thus, in r. xylanophilus, rxyl_ <dig> may also catalyze this deamination of ureidoglycine to ureidoglycolate, as the logical step following the action of the ugtcase rxyl_ <dig> . although this prediction remains to be experimentally validated, it would introduce another category of reaction module. in that case, while substrates and products are chemically similar, the enzymes catalyzing analogous reactions could be evolutionarily unrelated. consequently, automated detection of such modules with the currently available bioinformatic tools would be less simple than in the case of enzyme homology. however, it remains possible when using tools like chemmine  <cit>  to compare various substrates and products to detect similar chemical functions in alignable pathways.

use of the reaction module concept should be of great value when studying mechanistically diversified superfamilies  <cit> . reaction modules could be viewed as the elementary bricks used to assemble functional modules  <cit> . more generally, defining progressively these different elements will help to trace how the present pathways progressively diverged from ancestral pathways where the successive primordial enzymes  <cit>  were promiscuous and gave birth to the present-day superfamilies.
