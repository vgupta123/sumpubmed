BACKGROUND
bottlenose dolphin  and the other cetaceans represent the most successful mammalian colonization of the aquatic environment and have undergone a radical transformation from the original mammalian bodyplan. the discovery of two archaic whales with morphological homology between cetacea and artiodactyla brought conclusive anatomical support to clade cetartiodactyla  <cit> . whales and hippos shared a common semiaquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls around  <dig> million years ago . one of the two branches would evolve into cetaceans, possibly beginning about  <dig> million years ago, with the protowhale pakicetus, which underwent aquatic adaptation into the completely aquatic cetaceans  <cit> . so far nothing is known about the genomic organization of dolphin immunoglobulins  and t cell receptor  loci. the only studies of antigen receptors immunity revealed that igg are present in whales  <cit>  and ighg and igha genes have been described in the atlantic bottlenose dolphin  <cit> . within artiodactyls, the locus organization and expression of trg and tra/trd genes have been characterized in ruminants; these species have been shown to possess a large trg  and tra/trd  germline repertoire.

here we present a evolutionary and expression analysis of tursiops truncatus trg and tra/trd genes. the surprising feature concerning trg genes was, on the one hand, that the overall organization of the dolphin trg locus resembles more the structure of a typical cassette of artiodactyls  trg1) than the structure typical of the human locus  trg). on the other hand, equally surprising was the finding of an unusual mechanism of biases in the v-j gene rearrangement usage, which is reminiscent of the most frequently used in the human peripheral γδ t cells repertoire of productively rearranged trgv genes  <cit> . despite the fragmented and incomplete nature of the assembly, we have obtained important information on the genomics and the evolution of the tra/trd dolphin potential repertoire and its relationship with the expressed chains. furthermore, the structural 3d visualization, computed by adopting a comparative procedure, using cdna trgv-j and trdv-d-j rearranged amino acid sequences from a single individual, is consistent with the finding that the predicted γδ pairing, present both in the blood and in the skin, is shared among the organisms living in a controlled environment  as well as in those living in marine environment. this finding highlights in dolphin the existence of a basic “public” γδ repertoire of a given tr in a range of public t cell responses.

RESULTS
genomic arrangement and evolution of the dolphin trg locus
the recent availabily of a high quality draft sequence of the bottlenose dolphin  genome  <cit>   allowed us to identify the dolphin trg locus in two overlapping scaffolds  that provided a genomic sequence assembly of  <dig>  kb . in the dolphin, as in all mammalian species so far studied , the amphiphysin  gene flanks the trg locus at its 5′ end and the related to steroido-genic acute regulatory protein d3-n-terminal like  gene flanks the trg locus at its 3′ end. we annotated all the identified dolphin trg genes using the human  and ovine  trg genomic sequences as a reference; the beginning and end of each coding exon were accurately identified by locating the splice sites and the flanking recombination signal  sequences of the v and j genes . according to our results, the dolphin locus is the simplest of the mammalian trg loci identified to date  . it spans only 48 kb and its genes are arranged in a pattern comprising  <dig> trgv,  <dig> trgj genes and a single trgc  gene. a closer inspection of the dolphin, human and sheep constant genes , reveals, that the dolphin trgc  gene possesses a single small exon  <dig>  which is more similar to the sheep trgc <dig> ex <dig> than to the human trgc <dig> ex <dig>  . the dotplot matrix of dolphin trg and sheep trg <dig> loci genomic comparison displays a remarkable consistency of the identity diagonals, from the sheep trgv11- <dig> gene to the trgc <dig> gene  with a remarkable compactness of the three j genes. therefore the overall organization of the dolphin trg locus resembles more the structure of a typical single cassette of artiodactyls  trg1), than the structure typical of the human locus  trg) . high bootstrap values  in the phylogenetic tree from artiodactyls , human and dolphin, grouped dolphin trgv <dig> gene with human trgv <dig> gene and sheep trgv11- <dig> , and dolphin trgv <dig> gene with human trgv <dig>  and sheep trgv <dig> gene . it is noteworthy that, in sheep the trgv11- <dig> and the trgv <dig> genes lie within the trgc <dig> cassette , previously shown to be the most ancient one in cattle and sheep  <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the genomic organization of the dolphin trg locus as deduced from the genome assembly ttru_ <dig> . a the diagram shows the position of all v, j and c genes according to the imgt® nomenclature. the amph  and the stard3nl  genes at the 5′ end and at the 3′ end, respectively of the trg locus are shown. boxes representing genes are not to scale. exons are not shown. b description of the trgv, trgj, and trgc genes in the dolphin genome. the position of all genes in the jh <dig>  scaffold and their classification are reported. the bottlenose dolphin  trg genes and alleles have been approved by the who/iuis/imgt nomenclature subcommittee for ig, tr and mh  <cit> . a from l-part <dig> to 3′ end of v-region. c imgt protein display of the dolphin, human and sheep trgc genes. the description of the strands and loops is according to the imgt unique numbering for c-domain  <cit> . the extracellular region is shown with black letters, the connecting region is in orange, the transmembrane-region is in purple, and the cytoplasmic region is in pink. 1st-cys c <dig>  conserved-trp w <dig> and hydrophobic aa l <dig> and 2nd-cys c <dig> are colored  and in bold



genomic arrangement and evolution of the dolphin tra/trd genes
analysis of the ttru_ <dig>  dolphin genome assembly confirmed that the trd genes are clustered within the tra locus, as in eutherians and birds. the organization and structure of the dolphin tra/trd locus is similar to the organization of the locus in humans  tra/trd)  <cit> , i.e. the trav genes are located at its 5′ end with trdv interspersed, followed by the trdd genes , the trdj genes , and by a single trdc gene . a single trdv gene located, as in all mammals, in an inverted transcriptional orientation downstream of the trdc gene, has been named trdv <dig> by homology with the other artiodactyl tra/trd loci although no trdv <dig> gene has yet been isolated in dolphin . this gene in dolphin, in contrast to all the so far analyzed species, is a pseudogene, since we have found both by in silico analysis and by pcr on genomic dna, the presence of a stop codon . figure 2b shows the amino acid sequences of the dolphin tra/trd variable genes aligned according to the imgt unique numbering for v domain  <cit> . evolutionary analysis of dolphin, sheep, and human trav is shown in additional file 7a. the tree shows that  <dig> dolphin subgroups form a monophyletic group with a corresponding human and sheep gene subgroup, consistent with the occurrence of distinct subgroups prior to the divergence of the three mammalian species. three human trav subgroup  were found in dolphin, and not in sheep. in the tra/trd locus, the trdj, trdd, and trdc genes are followed finally by the traj genes ,  <dig> in humans and  <dig> in dolphin, and by a single trac. also in this case, the presence of several variable genes  belonging to the trdv <dig> subgroup, scattered in three different contigs, makes this portion of the dolphin locus more similar to the tra/trd locus of artiodactyls than to the human locus, as humans have only a single trdv <dig> gene  <cit> , while in cattle  <cit> , sheep  <cit>  and other artiodactyls the trdv <dig> subgroup is a large, multigene subgroup. in the phylogenetic tree, the membership of the trdv <dig> genes is supported by the monophyletic groupings, which are marked by  <dig> sheep,  <dig> dromedary and  <dig> dolphin members in contrast with the single human one .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the genomic organization of the bottlenose dolphin  tra/trd locus as deduced from the genome assembly ttru_ <dig> . a the diagram shows the position of the trdv, trdd, trdj and trdc genes and of the trav, traj and trac genes according to the imgt® nomenclature. the retrieval of the relevant contigs from the genbank  and ensembl databases , has allowed the identification, starting from the 5′ end of the locus, of  <dig> trav ,  <dig> trdv ,  <dig> trdd,  <dig> trdj ,  <dig> trdc,  <dig> traj and  <dig> trac genes, located in a genomic region spanning approximatively  <dig> kb . boxes representing genes are not to scale. exons are not shown. arrow head indicates the transcriptional orientation of the trdv <dig> gene. the arrows above the line of the traj genes indicate the 70 kb region that has been magnified in the lower part of the figure. b imgt protein display for the dolphin trav and trdv functional genes. the description of the strands and loops is according to the imgt unique numbering for v-region  <cit> . 1st-cys c <dig>  conserved-trp w <dig>  hydrophobic l <dig> and 2nd-cys c <dig> are colored  and in bold



5′ race pcr and rt-pcr on blood and skin rna identified the dolphin trg, tra and trd chains repertoire
four types of 5′ race and three types of rt-pcr  on total rna isolated from the peripheral blood of three unrelated adult animals  and from the skin of animal identified by letter c  were carried out to investigate the dolphin trg, tra and trd chains repertoire. we obtained a total of  <dig> unique  clonotypes of different length, each containing rearranged vj-c  and v-d-j-c  transcripts. a clonotype   is identified by a given rearranged v gene and allele, a given j gene and allele and a unique amino acid junction  <cit> . the v domains were checked for their typical features, i.e., the leader region and the five conserved amino acids , 2nd-cys  <dig> and anchor  <dig>  characteristic of a v-domain  <cit> . the functionality of each clonotype was determined based on the imgt® criteria: transcripts were considered as productive if they had in-frame junctions and no stop codons, whereas transcripts were considered as unproductive if they had frameshifts and/or stop codons. the junctions comprise the cdr3-imgt and the two anchors c <dig>  and f <dig>  or w <dig>  . fifty-nine trg clonotypes were obtained from m, l, k and c, respectively. twenty of the  <dig> trg clonotypes contained out-of-frame cdnas . all the remaining  <dig> trg clonotypes were productive, containing in-frame cdna sequences and were submitted to and accepted by the ena database in which they are identified by the hg <dig> to hg <dig> accession numbers . as all possible rearrangements between the two trgv and the three trgj genes were found both in blood and in skin, it can be concluded that all dolphin trg genes contribute to the formation of productive transcripts in all six trgv-trgj combinations .table  <dig> list of primers used in 5′ race, rt and genomic pcr

to investigate the dolphin tra chain repertoire, total rna from the peripheral blood of a female dolphin  was used as template in the single 5′ race experiment . a total of  <dig> different tra clonotypes were obtained and sequenced . all sequences were productive , and the leader region was of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids depending on the v subgroup. the cdr1- and cdr2-imgt lengths of the transcripts , ,  corresponded to nine different trav subgroups and  <dig> different genes and were associated with diverse cdr3-imgt of various length from  <dig> to  <dig> aa. in our cdna collection,  <dig> trav genes  were assigned unambiguously to genes annotated in the genomic sequence , while  <dig> could be assigned to new genes, belonging to five different subgroups. one gene belongs to a new subgroup, trav <dig> , not yet identified in the dolphin genomic sequence. one gene belongs to subgroup trdv <dig> , as shown by its cdr1- and cdr2-imgt lengths , and demonstrates that dolphin trdv genes can, as in other species, participate to the synthesis of tra chains by rearranging to a traj gene   <cit> . among the other new genes, six belong to subgroup trav <dig> , three belong to subgroup trav <dig>  and one to subgroup  <dig> . as these last subgroups have several members, an imgt approved provisional nomenclature was assigned , allowing these genes to be entered in imgt/gene-db and imgt® tools   <cit>  while waiting for the identification and location of these genes in the reference genomic sequence. three 5′ race experiments on total rna isolated from the peripheral blood of two unrelated adult animals   were carried out to investigate the dolphin trd chain repertoire; only one of these three pcr amplifications produced  <dig> in-frame,  <dig> out-of-frame and  <dig> sterile germline, clonotypes from the animal identified as m .

potential trgv domain repertoire of productive and unproductive trancripts
analyzing the trg in-frame transcripts it is noteworthy that  <dig> trg clonotypes were found identical in two or even three different individuals l and c , m, c and k , k and m , and m and c  . this observation was rather intriguing as they represented together 14/ <dig> in-frame sequences whereas in contrast each out-of-frame clonotype was found in a single individual. these shared clonotypes result from v1-j <dig> rearrangements in l and c  and in m, c and k , from v1-j <dig> rearrangements in k and m  and from v2-j <dig> rearrangements in m and c . this description of shared t cell clonoypes correspond to what is known in the literature as “public t cell response” in which t cells bearing identical tr may respond to the same antigenic epitope in different individuals  <cit> . although the number of the germline trg genes is low, which implies a reduced potential in the v-j recombination, a sufficient diversity and variability of the tr gamma transcripts seems to be guaranteed in the dolphin by the classical process of cdr <dig> diversity formation during somatic rearrangement  <cit> . indeed, the creation of the cdr <dig> diversity results from the trimming of the 3′v-region  for the in-frame junctions, up to  <dig> for the out-of-frame junctions), from the trimming of the 5′j-region , and from the addition at random of the n nucleotides creating the n-region  . this junction diversity is due to the activity of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase  encoded by dntt. the gene  has been identified in the bottle nosed dolphin genome and its amino acid sequence is 84 % identical to the human dntt. the graphical representation of the number of in-frame versus out-of-frame sequences obtained for the  <dig> possible trg rearrangements v1-j <dig>  v1-j <dig>  v1-j <dig>  v2-j <dig>  v2-j <dig> and v2-j <dig> display striking differences . both tests  reject the null hypothesis for v1-j <dig> and v2-j <dig> . this result confirms what was noticed at first sight and it follows that v1-j <dig> gene rearrangements were dominant among the in-frame transcripts and were rare among the out-of-frame transcripts.

to investigate the high frequency of the out-of-frame rearranged v2-j <dig> cdna, genomic pcr was carried out on dna from blood of the animal identified by l. this choice was motivated both by the ratio of  <dig> in-frame  on  <dig> out-of-frame  clonotypes with the rearranged v2-j <dig> and by the highest number clones  with the rearranged v1-j <dig> . the frequency of the out-of-frame v2-j <dig> genomic rearrangements  is in agreement with that of all the respective rearranged cdna clonotypes ; stop codons in the cdr <dig> seem to be generated in the unproductive v2-j <dig> rearrangements during the somatic recombination. furthermore, genomic v1-j <dig> clonotypes, obtained by pcr performed on the same animal, demonstrate that they are all productive with two cases of sharing of the cdr <dig>  i.e. v1j2l3/6/10/ <dig> and v1j2l9/ <dig> with 5rv1l2/c2/c <dig> and rtv1k1/k4/k <dig> cdna clonotypes, respectively .fig.  <dig> cdr <dig> nucleotide sequences retrieved from genomic rearranged clones. nucleotide sequences are shown from codon  <dig>  to codon  <dig>   and from codon  <dig>  to codon  <dig> . they are grouped on the basis of their rearrangement  and  trgv2-trgj <dig> or  trgv1-trgj <dig>  n-nucleotides added by tdt are indicated in lower cases. numbers in the left and right columns indicate the number of nucleotides that are trimmed from the 3'v-region and 5'j-region, respectively. the germline region of the trgv and trgj genes coincides with  <dig> in the nt v and nt j columns, respectively. clones with the same cdr3-imgt nucleotide sequence deriving from two or more animals  are underlined . in , unproductive rearrangements for the presence of a stop codon  and for frameshifts in the cdr <dig>  are indicated



computational analyses predict the pairing of the trgv1-j <dig> and of the trdv1-d1-j <dig> variable domains
to calculate the most likely computationally inferred interactions between the putative γδ pairing, we analysed the amino acid sequences of the three types of rearranged trd cdnas , v1-1–d7s1–j <dig>  and v2–j <dig>  rearrangements, respectively) found in the peripheral blood of the single animal identified in our study with the letter m , and of three relevant trg cdnas  among the six found in the peripheral blood of the same animal . the comparative inferred interactions of the trgv1/trdv <dig> and trgv1/trdv <dig> v domains, obtained using the aa sequences of the cdna rtv1m <dig>  and 5r1d <dig>  clonotypes and the sequences of the 5rv1m <dig>  and 5r1d <dig>  clonotypes , respectively, were computed using as templates the human γδ t cell receptor chains   <cit> . we point out that, according to visualization of the rtv1m1/5r1d <dig> complex shown in additional file 14a, the aspartic acid in the cdr <dig> position  <dig>  of the v − gamma domain, deriving from the addition of gagacac nucleotides during the trg v1-j <dig> recombination process, is predicted to be significantly involved in the formation of three possible salt bridge and of two of the seven calculated hydrogen bonds with the arginine in position  <dig> of the 5r1d <dig> clonotype  . the arginine in position  <dig> derives from the trdv1-1 n germline sequence in the cdr <dig> of the trd v1-j <dig> rearrangement   <cit> . the computationally inferred interaction between the glutamic acid in position  <dig> in the fr <dig> of the trg v1-j <dig> rearranged cdna 5rv1m <dig> clonotype  and the arginine in position  <dig> in the fr <dig> of the trd v2-j <dig> rearranged cdna 5r1d <dig> clonotype  is noteworthy because they are both involved in a possible salt bridge . the gln q <dig> of the 5r1d <dig> clonotype is just as important because it is involved in three possible hydrogen bonds with tyr y <dig>  trp w <dig> and lys k <dig> of the 5rv1m <dig> clone, respectively. in conclusion, we suggest that the rtv1m1/5r1d <dig> pairing is the most likely to form and it is the most stable  . this consideration, seems to be in compliance with the fact that the trg v1-j <dig> rearrangement, found both in the peripheral blood and in the skin, is not only the most frequent among the six possible rearrangements, but it is shared among the organisms living in the same controlled environment  as well as in those living in marine environment  .fig.  <dig> computationally inferred interaction between rtv1m <dig> v-gamma domain  and 5r1d <dig> v-delta domain   and between 5rv1m <dig> v-gamma domain  and 5r1d <dig> v-delta domain   cdna clonotypes. in rtv1m <dig> and 5rv1m <dig> v-gamma domain cdr-imgt are blue-green-green; in 5r1d <dig> and 5r1d <dig> v-delta domain cdr-imgt are red-orange-purple. imgt collier de perles of rtv1m1/5r1d <dig> and 5rv1m1/5r1d <dig> clones are shown  <cit> . the protein complex interface were computed by the online tool pdbepisa at the ebi server.  and visualized by ucsf chimera tool  



discussion
in this study we report an extensive analysis of the genomic organization and expression of the trg and tra/trd genes in dolphin. according to comparative analyses, dolphin trg locus is the simplest and the smallest among the mammalian trg loci identified to date  <cit>  and its organization is reminiscent of the structure of a typical single cassette of artiodactyls  <cit>  with a small number of genes, i.e. two trgv, three trgj and one trgc .

the analysis of dolphin tra/trd locus confirmed that trd genes are clustered within the tra locus and that genes belonging to the trdv <dig> subgroup are distributed among the trav genes as it is commonly expected in artiodactyls tra/trd locus  <cit> . a total of  <dig> trav and  <dig> trdv genes have been identified . by the criterion that gene sequences having 75 % or greater nucleotide identity belong to the same subgroup, the trav and the trdv genes belong to  <dig> and to three subgroups, respectively . the sheep trdv <dig> subgroup has been estimated to contain at least  <dig> genes  <cit> , while only  <dig> trdv <dig> genes have been identified in the genomic assembly  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis assigns the membership of the dolphin trdv <dig> genes due to the monophyletic groupings marked by  <dig> sheep,  <dig> dromedary and  <dig> dolphin members in contrast with the single human one .

dolphin tr alpha chain expression analysis allowed us to identify new trav genes, with respect to the available genomic sequence. furthermore a bias towards rearrangements containing tra genes belonging to the trav <dig>  and trav <dig>  gene subgroups, was observed . on the contrary, the usage of the  <dig> traj genes is generally random with a slight increase in usage of traj  between  <dig> and  <dig>  ; this finding being consistent with the widely accepted view that trav-traj recombination proceeds in a coordinated, sequential manner from proximal to progressively more distal trav and traj genes  <cit> .

dolphin tr gamma chain expression analysis demonstrated that the two trgv and three trgj were used in every possible combination, although a bias towards some transcripts  was noted. furthermore, about half the transcripts using trgv <dig> were unproductive due to the presence of stop codons in cdr <dig>  the percentage values of the productive/unproductive rearrangements are similar for both cdna  and genomic clones , in contrast with what is usually obseved .

in a previous work  <cit> , it was reported that biased v-j gene rearrangement contributes to the regulation of the mature trg repertoire. the biases in a given tr repertoire can stem from properties of the gene rearrangement process, as well as from thymic selection and the expansion of t cell clones. in the present work, we can make the following considerations: i) it seems to be a double preferentiality and that of the gene trgv <dig> with respect to the gene trgv <dig> as well as of the trg v1-j <dig> rearrangement with respect to the five others , the latter being supported given the comparison between the frequency of the in-frame and out-of-frame rearrangements both in cdna and in genomic dna ; ii) the fact that unrelated subjects show not only a biased usage of v-j genes, but also a biased number of nucleotides inserted/deleted at junction regions , could be explained by the presence of common antigens which can stimulate and expand t cells with a particular type of gamma chain, suggesting the existence of a basic “public” repertoire of a given tr in a range of public t cell responses; iii) finally we propose that the occurrence of clonotypes shared by different individuals who live both in marine and in artificial marine “habitat”, described as “convergent recombination”  <cit> , could be strictly related to the biased v-j recombinational event.

the mechanisms that determine biases in genes use remain unclear. in a recent paper  <cit>  a physical model of chromatin conformation at the trb d-j genomic locus explains more than 80 % of the biases in trbj use that was measured in murine t cells. as a consequence of these structural and other biases, tr sequences are produced with different a priori frequencies, thus affecting their probability of becoming public tr that are shared among individuals. in dolphin, we could explain the abundance of trgv1-j <dig> repertoire among individuals hypothizing that this combination could be produced by the rearrangement process with different a priori probabilities because an expanded role of chromatin conformation in trgv-j rearrangement, which controls both the gene accessibility and the precise determination of gene use.

an evolutionary correlation between the dolphin trgv <dig> and the human trgv <dig>  genes and the dolphin trgj <dig> and the human trgjp  genes seems to exist, as in these two species the same mechanism pushes to an accurate determination of the j gene usage. in fact, dolphin trgj <dig> this work) and human trgjp, are the most frequently used j genes in the peripheral γδ t cells  <cit>  and occupy an intermediate position with respect to the other two j genes. at present we have knowledge of the position of the genes on the physical map for human , dromedary  <cit> , dolphin  and sheep  <cit>   and cattle  <cit>  trg loci.

it is admitted that the expressed γ/δ t cell repertoire partly depends upon preferentially rearranged trgv-j gene combinations, indeed in human the gamma delta tcr repertoire is accompanied by selection for public gamma chain sequences such that many unrelated individuals overlap extensive in their circulating repertoire  <cit> . as a conseguence, the high frequency of trgv1-j2/trdv1-d1-j <dig> productive rearrangements in dolphins may represent a situation of oligoclonality comparable to that found in human with trgv9-jp/trdv2-d-j t cells, and in primates.

the similarity in dolphin and human of a basic public γδ repertoire, seems to be correlated with other recent findings. mcgowen discovered several genes, potentially under positive selection in the dolphin lineage, associated with the nervous system, including those related to human intellectual disabilities, synaptic plasticity and sleep  <cit> . moreover bottlenose dolphins are the only animals with man and apes, to be able to recognize themselves when confronted with a mirror  <cit> , and have demonstrated the numerical skills  <cit> . while here, in the present work, the functional convergence of γδ domains is suggested among mammals, recently it was proposed similarity of dual-function tra and trd genes in jawed vertebrates and in the vlra and vlrc genes in jawless vertebrates and their differential expression in two major t cell lineages . therefore comparative immunobiology of different vertebrate lineages may reveal heretofore unrealized features.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study identifies the genomic organization and the gene content of the trg and the tra/trd loci in the high quality draft sequence of the bottlenose dolphin  genome. the genomic structure of the smallest trg locus thus described in mammals, includes two trgv, three trgv and only one trgc genes. through phylogenetic and expression analyses,  <dig> trav were assigned unambiguously to genes annotated in the tra/trd locus genomic sequence, while  <dig> trav could be assigned to new genes, belonging to five different subgroups. the presence of several variable genes belonging to the trdv <dig> subgroup, makes the tra/trd dolphin locus more similar to the tra/trd locus of artiodactyls than to the human locus.

by comparing multiple different individuals, we provide evidence of an unusual ratio of productive/unproductive trg transcripts and of a bias towards trgv1-trgj <dig> rearrangements, which were dominant among the in-frame transcripts and were rare among the out-of-frame transcripts. moreover, the cdna analysis revealed sharing of in-frame trg sequences within the same and in different individuals living in a controlled environment as well as in marine environment, suggesting expansion of “public” tcr by a common antigen. the selection for public gamma chain and the high frequency of trgv1-j2/trdv1-d1-j <dig> productive rearrangements in dolphins may represent a situation comparable to that found in human with trgv9-jp/trdv2-d-j t cells.
