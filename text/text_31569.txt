BACKGROUND
the widespread success of the vertebrate lineage owes partly to the acquisition of the neural crest -derived jaw apparatus of the craniofacial skeleton  <cit> . the adult craniofacial skeleton forms through replacing and elaborating the underlying nc-derived embryonic cartilaginous skeleton. the pathways and mechanisms that form the embryonic cartilaginous jaw are still poorly understood and many genes involved in this process remain to be identified. the rapid development of the jaw cartilages in the zebrafish and its amenability to forward genetics makes it an excellent model organism for studying the genetic basis of craniofacial development  <cit> ; additionally, the use of retroviral insertional mutagenesis can facilitate the cloning of a large number of mutated genes  <cit> .

morphological development of the zebrafish pharyngeal cartilages has been described in detail  <cit> . briefly, the chondrocytes that form these embryonic cartilages are derived from cranial nc cells that migrate from the neural tube to occupy transient embryonic structures called the pharyngeal arches. the nc cells in the 1st arch give rise to the upper and lower jaw cartilages in all vertebrates examined. in zebrafish, the meckel's cartilage  serves as the embryonic lower jaw and the palatoquadrate  serves as the embryonic upper jaw. the nc cells in the zebrafish 2nd arch give rise to cartilages that support the jaw apparatus and anchor it to the neurocranium.

extensive work in mice  <cit> , chick  <cit> , and zebrafish  <cit>  has shed substantial light on the pathways that pattern the nc cells within an arch. the endothelin- <dig>  pathway is essential for patterning the nc cells that give rise to the lower jaw. edn <dig> is a small peptide ligand secreted by the pharyngeal pouch ectoderm and endoderm cells as well as by the arch core mesoderm. as shown in other vertebrates, edn <dig> signals through binding to a seven-transmembrane g protein-coupled receptor  expressed on the nc cells to regulate a downstream network of transcription factors  <cit> . in zebrafish, the downstream network includes members of the distal-less  gene family, hand <dig> and bapx <dig>  <cit> . although recent evidence has shed light on how some of these downstream factors function in patterning the craniofacial skeleton, the upstream patterning events and pathways that lead to induction of edn <dig> are less clear. notably, it has been reported that the transcription factor tbx <dig> functions upstream of edn <dig> signaling in the ab* zebrafish background  <cit> . also, it has recently been reported that tbx <dig> is essential for meckel's cartilage formation in xenopus  <cit> . however, tbx1-/- mice do not present meckel's cartilage defects  <cit> . importantly, tbx1-/- mice do show reduction of the 1st arch-derived incus, a middle ear ossicle, indicating a role for tbx <dig> in 1st arch development  <cit> . yet, edn1-/- mice do not lack the incus  <cit> . thus, the genes and mechanisms upstream of the edn <dig> pathway in meckel's cartilage development remain unclear. although it is possible that regulation of edn <dig> is different between mammals and either frog or fish, an alternative possibility is that a more universal and highly conserved pathway may await discovery.

to shed light on the pathways required for craniofacial patterning, we screened a collection of embryonic lethal insertional mutant zebrafish lines  using the cartilage stain alcian blue and inspected the mutants for defects in the craniofacial skeleton at  <dig> days post fertilization . we screened  <dig> genetic loci and identified  <dig> loci required for craniofacial development. we identified the mutated genes for  <dig> of these  <dig> loci. two of the identified genes are known to be mutated in the human diseases campomelic dysplasia and ehlers-danlos syndrome and thus those two mutants might serve as zebrafish models for these diseases. also among these mutants, we identified the dirty south  mutant that harbors an insertion in the wdr <dig> gene. wdr <dig> is a wd <dig> repeat domain protein of unknown function homologous to the petunia gene an <dig> that regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis and it is also highly homologous to the arabidopsis gene ttg <dig> that regulates root, shoot and leaf patterning events  <cit> . wdr <dig> has been isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle in protein complexes containing two members of the dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase gene family, dyrk1a and dyrk1b  <cit> . dyrk1a-/- mice show general growth defects  <cit> . notably, dyrk1a maps to a critical region for down syndrome  in humans and over-expression of dyrk1a in mice has been reported to cause ds-like neurological defects  <cit> . rnai-mediated knockdown of dyrk1b in the mouse myoblast cell line c2c <dig> causes a loss of myogenin expression and blocks in vitro differentiation of the cells into myotubes  <cit> . thus, roles are emerging for dyrk <dig> gene family members in various developmental processes  <cit> .

here, we show that wdr <dig> is required for lower jaw cartilage formation upstream of the edn1-signaling pathway. we also present evidence that wdr <dig> is required to form the upper jaw cartilage indicating that wdr <dig> activity is essential for all 1st arch nc cell patterning. we demonstrate intracellular co-localization with nuclear dyrk1a and present evidence suggesting that nuclear localization may be important for craniofacial patterning. using an rna rescue assay, we found that the fly wdr <dig> homolog cg <dig> can rescue the dys mutant phenotype indicating conservation of wdr <dig> activity in animals lacking the nc cell lineage.

RESULTS
screening identified diverse genes involved in craniofacial development
a list of all the genes identified in the hopkins lab by insertional mutagenesis screening has been published  <cit> . the insertional mutant collection can also be viewed online  <cit> . to identify genes required for craniofacial development we screened the insertional mutant collection at  <dig> days post fertilization using the cartilage stain alcian blue. we inspected  <dig> recessive-lethal insertional mutant loci for defects in the craniofacial cartilages . briefly, the 1st arch nc cells give rise to the zebrafish jaw that consists of a proximal palatoquadrate  that articulates with the distal meckel's  cartilage. the 2nd arch nc cells give rise to the hyosymplectic and ceratohyal . the hyosymplectic is composed of a proximal hyomandibular  region and a distal symplectic  region. the hyosymplectic articulates with the distal ch and together these 2nd arch-derived structures support the more anterior jaw by anchoring it to the neurocranium  <cit> . through inspecting these cartilages, we identified  <dig> specific cartilage phenotype classes . to identify specific craniofacial development mutants, we excluded mutants that, in addition to anterior arch defects, also showed progressive loss of the posterior arches.

the anterior arch patterning class contains  <dig> mutant loci with specific patterning defects in the arch  <dig> derivatives, the arch  <dig> derivatives or both . studies on lazarus/pbx <dig> mutants revealed essential roles in neural tube development and maintaining separate neural crest streams  <cit> . previous characterization of the nos/foxi <dig> mutant revealed the importance of cell survival signals in hm formation and additional screening identified two additional loci required for hm development, word of mouth  and sec61a   <cit> . we identified  <dig> alleles of sec61a and although the sec61ahi <dig> allele shows general defects that complicate analysis, the sec61ahi2839b allele lacks the anterior portion of the hm  region but clearly retains the posterior hm  region . notably, the wom mutant also appears to lack the ahm region and retain the phm region. in contrast, the nos/foxi <dig> mutant lacks both the ahm and phm regions

the chondrocyte differentiation class contains  <dig> mutant loci with generally impaired overall chondrogenesis . among these mutants is the previously characterized jellyfish/sox9a  mutant that is a zebrafish disease model for campomelic dysplasia  <cit> . we also identified a mutation in the glycosaminoglycan biosynthetic enzyme b4galt <dig> that represents a new zebrafish disease model for the progeroid form of ehlers-danlos syndrome .

the cell morphology class contains  <dig> mutant loci that are required for proper chondrocyte morphology . the gonzo and knypek mutants have been previously described  <cit> . we have not yet identified the gene disrupted in the old skool  mutant .

we performed blast searches against the current human protein database using the predicted protein sequences for the  <dig> identified zebrafish genes. in 15/ <dig> cases, a human homolog to the zebrafish protein was readily identified. the average amino acid sequence identity between the fish and human homologs was 77% and ranged from 47% to 99% identity . database analysis also revealed diverse cellular functions and protein domain architectures for the identified genes. notably,  <dig> of the  <dig> chondrocyte differentiation mutants function in the glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis pathway highlighting the importance of this pathway in chondrogenesis and related disease states. also,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes function in the er protein secretory pathway,  <dig> genes function in wnt signaling,  <dig> encode transcription factors and  <dig> encode wd40-repeat domain proteins. thus, the genes we identified as essential for craniofacial development in the zebrafish appear to function in diverse cellular processes and are highly conserved in humans suggesting they may also be essential for human craniofacial development.

phenotype of the dirty south  mutant and identification of wdr <dig> as the mutated gene
the dirty south  mutants display variably reduced m and pq cartilages with variable reductions in the ch as well . the mutant was named in reference to the variable lower jaw cartilage defects. through inspecting large numbers of alcian blue stained dys mutant animals we found that most dys mutants displayed the 'strong' phenotype of severe reductions in both the m and pq with small clusters of cartilage cells possibly derived from either the m or pq or both often present . although in most dys mutant animals the ch was present, we occasionally observed dys mutant animals that lacked one of the two bilaterally symmetric ch cartilages . in fact, we often observed asymmetric defects where cartilages on one side would appear more severely reduced than on the contra-lateral side . also, less than 5% of observed dys mutants showed mild defects instead of the more severe losses described above. these 'mild' defect animals tended to show only simple joint fusions between otherwise relatively normal m and pq as well as ch and hm cartilages . the pq is composed of two distinct regions. the ptergoid process  is a thin rod of chondrocytes that extends anteriorly from the planar body of the pq. a small percentage of dys mutants showed restrictions of the planar mid-region of the pq with what appears to be an identifiable anterior ptp region and posterior planar pq body region . the distal m cartilage was always observed in these animals, albeit fused to the anterior region of what might be the ptp. occasionally, we observed what appears to be complete splitting of the pq planar body .

the dys locus encodes the  <dig> amino acid protein wdr <dig>  <cit> . genome database searches revealed only one wdr <dig> gene in the human, mouse, and fish although we cannot rule out the possibility that the genome databases are incomplete. the insertion is in the first exon of the wdr <dig> gene,  <dig> nucleotides downstream from the predicted translation initation site . rt-pcr analysis revealed that dyshi <dig> is a null mutant . notably, wdr <dig> transcripts are readily detected by rt-pcr in wild type animals at all developmental stages including unfertilized oocytes . as a negative control, edn <dig> transcripts, which are not detectable by ish until late somitogenesis stages, could not be detected by rt-pcr in unfertilized oocytes or in samples earlier than  <dig> hpf . although the observed cartilage phenotype variation outlined in figures  <dig> l–o might be due to residual maternal wdr <dig> activity in the dys mutants, we cannot rule out the possibility that this observed phenotypic variation may result from the independent segregation of an unknown number of modifier loci.

the wdr <dig> gene is expressed ubiquitously during early development
consistent with the rt-pcr data indicating the presence of wdr <dig> transcripts at all early stages of development, we found by whole-mount in situ hybridization  ubiquitous expression of wdr <dig> at sphere, tailbud,  <dig> somites and  <dig> somites stages . by the  <dig> somites stage, some enrichment of transcripts in the forebrain and hindbrain regions could be detected and patterned expression in the developing somites was also apparent . also, transcripts could be observed lateral to the neural tube in a region that would correspond to the post-migratory nc cells at this stage . by  <dig> hpf, wdr <dig> transcripts were significantly enriched in the head region relative to the tail region . by  <dig> hpf, restricted expression of wdr <dig> was evident in the developing somites . by  <dig> hpf, wdr <dig> transcripts were expressed strongly in almost all head structures and only expressed at very low levels in the tail region . ish analysis on dys mutant animals was not able to detect any wdr <dig> expression consistent with the rt-pcr results indicating that the dyshi <dig> allele encodes a null mutation of the wdr <dig> gene . notably, wdr <dig> transcripts were detected from sphere stage through to  <dig> hpf in all regions of the embryo currently known to play roles in craniofacial development including the pharyngeal pouches.

to further confirm that the dys mutant phenotype is caused by the proviral insertion disrupting the wdr <dig> locus, we designed two translation blocking antisense morpholino oligonucleotides  to the wdr <dig> transcript. we found that both gave similar results and that both gave the similar range of variable m, pq, sy and ch defects as were observed for the dys mutant . the images in figure  <dig> depict the craniofacial apparatus in whole-mount embryos in contrast to the dissected flat-mounted cartilages shown in figure  <dig> 

wdr <dig> activity is required for all 1st arch cartilage formation
in performing titrations of the wdr68mo we noted that low concentrations tended to cause only mild cartilage joint fusion defects while higher concentrations were more similar to the defects observed in dyshi3812/dyshi <dig> homozygotes and occasionally yielded more severe reductions in the pq and ch regions. since rt-pcr analysis indicated that wdr <dig> transcripts are maternally supplied we reasoned that zygotic dys mutants probably harbor some residual amount of maternally supplied wdr <dig> activity. likewise, antisense morpholino knockdowns are not 100% efficient at blocking translation and therefore residual wdr <dig> activity would likely also be present in the knockdown animals. thus, we injected clutches of embryos from dyshi3812/+ parental crosses with the wdr68mo  and stained the cartilages with alcian blue in an attempt to reveal more clearly what might be the phenotype for a more complete loss of wdr <dig> activity. we found that approximately 3/ <dig> of the embryos were similar to wild type animals injected with the wdr68mo and showed the range of phenotypes typically observed for dys/dys homozygotes leading us to suspect they represent the expected mendelian 3/ <dig> of +/+ and dys/+ animals . in contrast, we found that approximately 1/ <dig> of the injected animals nearly completely lacked the m, pq, sy and ch cartilages . a negative control morpholino had no effect in wild type embryos and did not significantly exacerbate the cartilage defects in clutches of embryos from dyshi3812/+ parental crosses . we found similar results using wdr68mo <dig> .

we compared the dys+wdr68mo animals to animals injected with a previously characterized edn <dig> translation blocking morpholino  that is reported to nearly fully phenocopy the defects present in edn <dig> mutant zebrafish  <cit> . similar to previous reports we found that edn <dig> is required for the formation of the m, sy and ch cartilages but not for the pq or hm regions . in contrast, we found that dys mutants also present defects in the pq that seem to affect the anterior ptp region more strongly than the posterior planar pq region . attempts to reduce wdr <dig> activity from maternally supplied transcripts through generating dys+wdr68mo animals showed almost complete loss for the m, pq, sy and ch . thus, wdr <dig> activity appears to be required for all edn1-dependent cartilages plus the ptp and pq regions.

wdr <dig> activity is not required for normal nc cell migration
since defects in nc cell migration might lead to the loss or malformation of craniofacial elements, we used a dlx <dig> probe in whole-mount ish to determine whether cranial nc cell migration occurs normally in dys mutant animals. we could not detect any alterations in the migration of the  <dig> cranial nc cell streams that fill the 1st, 2nd and posterior arches at the  <dig> somites stage suggesting that neither cranial nc cell induction or migration is severely altered in dys mutants .

wdr <dig> activity is required for endothelin- <dig> expression
because loss of wdr <dig> activity caused defects in all edn1-dependent cartilage elements plus the pq, we examined whether wdr <dig> might act upstream of the edn <dig> pathway  <cit> . using an edn <dig> probe in whole-mount ish, we found that while edn <dig> was readily detected in wild type siblings at the  <dig> somites stage, dyshi3812/dyshi <dig> animals had severely reduced edn <dig> transcript levels . to rule out the possibility that there might be a mild delay in edn <dig> expression, we also examined expression at  <dig> hpf and found expression to also be severely reduced at this later stage . we left the  <dig> hpf animals unbleached to indicate the relatively normal development of the neural crest that give rise to melanocytes to further indicate the absence of a general developmental delay in dys mutant animals . notably, low and slightly variable levels of edn <dig> transcripts were detected in the dys mutants at both the  <dig> somites stage and later at the  <dig> hpf stage. variation in the residual levels of edn <dig> transcripts may account for some of the observed phenotypic variation . for additional evidence that wdr <dig> is required for edn <dig> pathway activity we also examined several downstream components of the edn <dig> pathway. bapx <dig> is a transcription factor required for induction of the jaw joint that is edn1-dependent  <cit> . in situ hybridization with bapx <dig> probe showed that while readily detected in wild type siblings, dyshi3812/dyshi <dig> animals had severely reduced bapx <dig> transcript levels . the transcription factors hand <dig> and dlx3b are also edn1-dependent and in situ hybridization likewise showed that dyshi3812/dyshi <dig> animals had reduced transcript levels . notably, only the arch-specific expression domains for both hand <dig> and dlx3b were affected indicating that a general delay in embryonic development cannot explain the absence of expression in the arches . also, the 1st arch domains for both markers was more reduced than the 2nd arch domains perhaps explaining the relatively milder 2nd arch derived ch cartilage reductions. . examining edn <dig> expression at this relatively late developmental stage,  <dig> hpf, revealed a similar difference with 1st arch edn <dig> expression more reduced than 2nd arch edn <dig> expression .

analyzing the cartilages of dys+wdr68mo animals suggested that wdr <dig> activity is required for all edn1-dependent cartilage development. to more precisely explore this possibility, we generated dys+wdr68mo animals and processed them for ish analysis to determine whether the residual expression of hand <dig> and dlx3b we observed in the 2nd arch is wdr68-dependent. we found that 2nd arch expression of hand <dig> and dlx3b was consistently more reduced in approximately 1/ <dig> of the dys+wdr68mo animals. the further reduction of 2nd arch expression is not due to a non-specific general developmental delay because expression of hand <dig> in the developing heart was not affected and development of the nc cell-derived melanocytes was not affected in the animals analyzed for hand <dig> expression . likewise, expression of dlx3b in the developing olfactory and otic domains was not substantially affected in the dys+wdr68mo animals . we also compared the expression of hand <dig> and dlx3b to edn1mo animals and found that dys+wdr68mo animals more closely resemble edn1mo animals than do the dys mutants but that directly blocking edn <dig> expression does yield more complete reductions suggesting that dys+wdr68mo animals still harbor some residual edn <dig> signaling . we also found that wdr <dig> activity is similarly required for the arch-specific expression domains of dlx4a, dlx4b, dlx5a and dlx6a . expression of the dlx genes was also edn1-dependent . collectively, these data indicate that wdr <dig> activity is required for edn <dig> expression and its downstream targets.

in zebrafish, as in mammals, chondrocyte differentiation requires the activity of a sox <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . to determine whether wdr <dig> activity is also required for chondrocyte differentiation, we examined expression of the zebrafish sox9a gene. like the other arch markers, we found that 1st arch expression was more reduced than 2nd arch expression in dys mutants . consistent with edn1mo animals having a relatively normal pq, we detected some residual sox9a expression in the 1st arch of those animals . in all cases, residual sox9a expression in the 2nd arch region likely reflects the relatively normal formation of the hm region .

the tbx <dig> gene has been shown to regulate edn <dig> expression in the ab* zebrafish line  <cit> . however, loss of tbx <dig> causes less severe defects in the tubingen zebrafish line, perhaps due to differences in modifier loci between the ab* and tubingen lines  <cit> . since the insertional mutant lines were generated and are maintained on tab <dig> and tab <dig>  two lines derived from a cross between tubingen and ab*  <cit> , we cannot readily predict the role for tbx <dig> in the lines used in this study. regardless, we examined the expression of tbx <dig> in dys animals and found normal expression at  <dig> hpf and at most only modest reduction of tbx <dig> expression in the pharyngeal region at  <dig> hpf . therefore, wdr <dig> does not appear to be essential for tbx <dig> expression and tbx <dig> expression alone is not sufficient for edn <dig> expression in our lines.

arch identity underlies the differential sensitivity to wdr <dig> activity
the observation that the 1st arch derived m and pq cartilages were consistently more severely reduced than the 2nd arch derived ch and hm cartilages in dyshi3812/dyshi <dig> animals suggested that perhaps 1st arch patterning requires more wdr <dig> activity than 2nd arch patterning. ish analysis of hand <dig> and dlx3b expression also suggests that 1st arch patterning requires more wdr <dig> activity than 2nd arch patterning. consistently, injecting animals with antisense translation blocking morpholinos increased the severity of 2nd arch cartilage and gene expression phenotypes. to test whether wdr <dig> activity is differentially required between the 1st and 2nd arches, we hypothesized that if the 1st arch structures require higher levels of wdr <dig> activity than the 2nd arch structures, then transformation of the 2nd arch into a duplication of the 1st arch would result in near complete absence of all jaw cartilages. the nc cells within the 1st arch do not express the hox transcription factor genes that are expressed by nc cells within the 2nd arch. loss of hox transcription factor activity in the 2nd arch causes transformation into 1st arch identity. likewise, it has been shown that loss of the hox transcription factor co-activator moz/myst <dig> causes transformation of the 2nd arch into a duplication of the 1st arch  <cit> . therefore, we injected clutches of embryos from dyshi3812/+ parental crosses with an antisense morpholino against moz/myst <dig>  and stained for cartilages. in approximately 3/ <dig> of the animals, we observed transformation of the 2nd arch derivatives into a duplication of the 1st arch cartilages . these animals were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild type tab <dig> and tab <dig> animals injected with mozmo <dig> consistent with the notion that these animals represent the +/+ and dyshi3812/+ siblings as expected based on mendelian genetics. the slightly less complete nature of these transformations relative to results previously reported might be due to differences between the zebrafish lines used in this study versus the previously reported study  <cit> . in contrast, approximately 1/ <dig> of the animals lacked virtually any jaw cartilages . we reason, based on mendelian ratios, that these animals are likely to be the dyshi3812/dyshi <dig> animals. the strong reduction of the transformed 2nd arch derivatives is consistent with a differential requirement for wdr <dig> activity along the a/p axis. these results together with the ish data on edn <dig>  hand <dig> and dlx3b support a model in which the level of wdr <dig> activity required for 1st arch-associated edn <dig> expression is higher than that required for 2nd arch-associated edn <dig> expression explaining why dys/dys animals display relatively milder 2nd arch defects than would be predicted for a gene required upstream of edn <dig> 

wdr <dig> protein localizes to the cell nucleus
the only proteins known to physically interact with wdr <dig> are dyrk1a and dyrk1b  <cit> . dyrk1a has been observed to localize within the nucleus  <cit> . to determine whether wdr <dig> also localizes to the cell nucleus we constructed mrfp1-dyrk1a and gfp-wdr <dig> fusion protein vectors and transiently transfected hek-293ft cells with various combinations of the vectors  <cit> . as controls, empty gfp and mrfp <dig> vectors were both detected throughout the cell . consistent with previous reports on dyrk1a localization, the mrfp1-dyrk1a fusion protein localized to the nucleus when co-expressed with an empty gfp vector . the gfp-wdr <dig> fusion protein also localized to the nucleus when co-expressed with an empty mrfp <dig> vector . when expressed together, gfp-wdr <dig> and mrfp1-dyrk1a co-localized to the nucleus . in all cases, the locations of nuclei were determined using dapi.

in arabidopsis, there are at least  <dig> wdr <dig> homologs with clustal w sequence similarity ranging from 54% to 45%. among these are the protein ttg <dig>  which is essential for root and shoot patterning events including axis patterning of the leaf. among several strong arabidopsis ttg <dig> mutant alleles, ttg1- <dig> encodes a point mutation that changes a single serine to a phenylalanine, s282f  <cit> . this position is within a region of the protein that is highly conserved across all organisms examined and all multicellular animals code for the chemically similar threonine at this position . thus we engineered the corresponding putative null t284f mutation into the zebrafish wdr <dig> gene. to determine whether the engineered putative null t284f can still localize with nuclear dyrk1a, we constructed a gfp-t284f fusion. the t284f fusion protein failed to co-localize with mrfp1-dyrk1a .

wdr <dig> activity is conserved in animals lacking nc cells
blast analysis with wdr <dig> revealed the presence of wdr <dig> homologs in all eukaryotic organisms for which complete genome sequence is available including non-vertebrate animals like drosophila  <cit> . using clustal w to determine sequence similarities  <cit> , the drosophila homolog, cg <dig>  is 84% similar to the zebrafish gene. to determine whether cg <dig> is a functional homolog to the vertebrate protein, we developed an rna rescue assay for the dys mutant cartilage phenotype. we injected dys mutant clutches with flag-tagged zebrafish wdr <dig> transcripts and compared them to either uninjected animals or animals injected with ef1α transcripts as a negative control . while ef1α transcripts were unable to rescue the mutant phenotype, zebrafish wdr <dig> rescued the strong cartilage patterning defects causing a concomitant increase in the number of observed mild joint fusion animals . we also tested the engineered t284f mutant in the rna rescue assay. the t284f transcript was unable to rescue the cartilage defects consistent with the prediction that this encodes a null allele similar to the plant homolog . we then tested cg <dig> for the ability to rescue the cartilage defects present in the dys mutant zebrafish. remarkably, cg <dig> rescued the strong cartilage defects as efficiently as the zebrafish wdr <dig> transcripts . thus, wdr <dig> activity is functionally conserved from animals that lack nc cells.

discussion
insights from screening for craniofacial mutants
as the zebrafish insertional mutant collection represents approximately 25% of the genes essential during the first  <dig> days and this screen identified  <dig> loci, we can extrapolate that at least  <dig> genes essential during the first  <dig> days of development are also required for craniofacial development in the zebrafish  <cit> . genes essential for very early developmental events such as gastrulation may have been missed in this screen. similarly, not all defects in craniofacial patterning will necessarily result in lethality by day  <dig> in the zebrafish. thus, the range of approximately  <dig> genes establishes a lower limit on the total number of genes required for craniofacial development.

previous large-scale enu screens identified a group of anterior arch mutants with defects in the distal cartilages and most appear to function within the edn <dig> pathway  <cit> . notably, the edn <dig> pathway controls distal cartilage fate in both the 1st and 2nd arches  <cit> . neither previous screens nor our screening identified a complementary pathway controlling all proximal cartilage fate. however,  <dig> of the  <dig> identified patterning mutants have specific reductions in the proximal 2nd arch derived hm region without affecting the proximal 1st arch pq implying that distinct pathways control the patterning of the hm region.

previous studies on the nos/foxi <dig> mutant indicated that hm formation requires cell survival signals  <cit> . analysis of a zebrafish integrin-alpha- <dig> mutant that displays a reduced ahm region also revealed an essential role for nc cell survival signals  <cit> . interestingly, the wom and sec61a genes might be required for ahm formation due to roles in mediating cell survival through processes typically viewed as general 'housekeeping' activities. at 29% sequence similarity, the closest yeast homolog to wom is swd2p, an essential subunit of the set <dig> histone methyltransferase  complex required for transcription of many genes. interestingly, differential hmt substrate specificity by different regulatory complexes containing different set domains is one feature of the proposed 'histone code' for epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation  <cit> . also, swd2p is a required subunit in the cleavage and polyadenylation factor complex  <cit> . the sec <dig> complex is essential for protein translocation into the er. thus, hm formation may require cell survival signals together with high expression levels of a relatively limited number of apparent housekeeping genes that perhaps mediate rate-limiting steps in survival pathways. alternatively, paralogs with partial functional redundancy for these presumably cell-essential genes may compensate in other tissues.

wdr <dig> activity is essential for edn1-dependent distal cartilage formation
we showed that wdr <dig> activity is required for edn <dig> expression. we also provided evidence that higher levels of wdr <dig> activity are required for 1st arch edn <dig> expression and expression of downstream edn1-dependent genes such as hand <dig> and dlx3b than are required for 2nd arch edn <dig> expression, providing an explanation as to why defects in the 2nd arch appear less severe in dys mutants than in edn1mo animals. the 2nd arch likely requires lower levels of wdr <dig> activity for induction of the edn <dig> pathway. we also found that tbx <dig> expression was not substantially reduced in dys mutants or wdr68mo animals suggesting that wdr <dig> either acts downstream of tbx <dig> or in a parallel pathway also required for edn <dig> expression.

wdr <dig> activity is essential for proximal pq and ptp formation
unlike edn <dig> mutants, which retain an identifiable and intact pq, dys mutants display severe disruptions of the ptp and pq. thus, wdr <dig> activity is required for all edn1-dependent cartilages plus the 1st arch proximal edn1-independent pq region indicating that wdr <dig> activity is required upstream of a putative pq formation pathway. future studies will be needed to identify the putative wdr68-dependent pq formation pathway genes. also, the ptp of the pq appears to serve as the maxilla region at this early developmental stage. therefore, it would be very informative to generate and analyze a wdr68-/- mouse for defects in the pharyngeal arch derivatives. such an analysis would also shed substantial light on the evolution of craniofacial structures.

the wdr <dig> and dyrk1a proteins both localize to the nucleus
the nuclear localization of mammalian dyrk1a has been previously reported and the biochemical purification of a large protein complex from rabbit skeletal muscle that contains both wdr <dig> and dyrk1a suggests that wdr <dig> might also localize to the cell nucleus  <cit> . our observation that a zebrafish gfp-wdr <dig> fusion indeed localizes to the nucleus is consistent with the formation of an intra-nuclear wdr68-dyrk <dig> protein complex . since the wdr <dig> t284f mutant was not able to complement the craniofacial defects of dys mutant animals in the rna rescue assay, the failure of the wdr <dig> t284f mutant to localize to the nucleus may suggest that nuclear localization of wdr <dig> is required for craniofacial development. the change from a nuclear to a punctate cytoplasmic localization may also indicate that nuclear localization of wdr <dig> requires some additional feature associated with having a hydroxyl group at position  <dig> such as the ability to accept phosphorylation. however, punctate cytoplasmic expression patterns can also indicate misfolding or destabilization and degradation of a fusion protein. thus, a more detailed biochemical analysis of the wdr68-dyrk <dig> interaction will be required to determine the true significance of these observed changes.

the wdr68-dyrk <dig> protein complex is conserved in all eukaryotes
the fly homolog cg <dig> rescued the strong cartilage defects as efficiently as the zebrafish wdr <dig> transcripts, indicating that the molecular functions of wdr <dig> required by arthopods is the same as that required by vertebrates. notably, the wdr <dig> interaction partners dyrk1a and dyrk1b are homologs to the drosophila minibrain  gene, suggesting conservation of a protein complex  <cit> . although the expression pattern for dyrk1b has not been reported, in mice, ish analysis revealed expression of dyrk1a in the pharyngeal arches and the dyrk1a-/- animals showed severe growth delay and were lethal by e <dig>   <cit> . although the dys mutants showed only a modest reduction in overall body size, we found that wdr <dig> co-localized in the nucleus with dyrk1a . thus, it will be worthwhile to investigate whether the zebrafish dyrk <dig> genes might have roles in craniofacial development. the observation that dyrk1a intracellular localization undergoes dynamic changes during brain development in the chick suggests that the wdr68-dyrk <dig> complexes may function as signaling intermediates  <cit> . likewise, the finding that dyrk1b is required for the differentiation switch in myotubes suggests that the wdr68-dyrk <dig> protein complexes might function in diverse organisms and tissues to regulate various developmental events  <cit> .

high throughput mass spectrometric identification of protein complexes in yeast identified the wdr <dig> homolog ypl247c in  <dig> complexes, containing  <dig> and  <dig> proteins each, and both complexes contain the dyrk <dig> homolog yak <dig>  <cit> . thus, wdr68-dyrk <dig> protein complexes are conserved from yeast to mammals.

detailed studies of yak <dig> indicate that it is required for pseudohyphal differentiation and functions in growth control  <cit> . yak <dig> may act within the target of rapamycin  pathway as rapamycin induces nuclear localization of yak <dig> and yak <dig> deletion confers rapamycin resistance in certain strains  <cit> . thus, the presence of wdr <dig> homologs in unicellular eukaryotes such as s. cerevisiae further suggests that wdr68-dyrk <dig> protein complexes participate in switches from growth to differentiation. further studies will be required to determine how the wdr68-dyrk <dig> protein complexes function and what role they might play in craniofacial development.

CONCLUSIONS
our data reveal the identity of approximately 25% of the essential genes required for craniofacial development in the zebrafish and demonstrate functional conservation between the fly and fish wdr <dig> homologs. we further show that the wdr <dig> gene is required upstream of the edn <dig> signaling pathway and that it localizes to the cell nucleus. one intriguing possibility is that a nuclear wdr68-dyrk <dig> protein complex may act as a transcriptional co-regulatory complex. exploring this possibility will require further characterization of the complex as well as downstream putative target genes.
