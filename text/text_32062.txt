BACKGROUND
the asian shrew-like moles  are the only living genus in uropsilinae and encompass the most primitive subfamily of talpidae  <cit> . in contrast to semi-fossorial shrew moles, fossorial moles, and aquatic desmans, the members of uropsilus possess a shrew-like body shape, conspicuous external ears, a slender tail as long as the head-body length, and compressed claws without specialized characters for burrowing. all of these characters indicate an ambulatory lifestyle  <cit> . although the ancestor species of uropsilinae were widely distributed throughout eurasia, the distribution of the relict genus uropsilus is limited to southwest china and north myanmar, in middle to high montane forests. the basal position of uropsilinae in the family is supported by morphological characters  <cit>  and dna sequences  <cit> , although the evolutionary relationships within this genus remain poorly understood. despite a recent description of a new species  using morphometric and molecular approaches  <cit> , the classifications of living uropsilines has been based exclusively on morphological and morphometric comparisons, and the taxonomy has changed several times : three genera , five species  and two subspecies  have been named . five taxa are currently recognized as full species of the genus uropsilus , whereas the other two  are recognized as synonyms of u. gracilis <cit> . however, only a few cyt b sequences are available for four of the recognized species, and most of the taxon sampling was limited to western sichuan  <cit> ; furthermore, there are no available sequences for u. investigator. thus, it would be interesting to examine whether the current taxonomy can be recovered by molecular approaches and whether morphological cryptic species exist within the widely distributed species  <cit> .

the mountains of southwest china and adjacent areas harbor an extremely high biodiversity  <cit> . two nonexclusive hypotheses, including a pre-pleistocene diversification model and a pleistocene refugia model have been proposed to explain the expansion of endemic species  <cit> . under the pre-pleistocene diversification model, the uplifting of the qinghai-tibetan plateau  in association with climate changes boosted allopatric speciation . conversely, quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles caused repeated shifts in distribution ranges  <cit> , which may also have motivated diversification and speciation in isolated mountain chains  <cit> . given that uropsilinae might have evolved for approx.  <dig> million years  <cit> , this genus could be a promising model to test these two hypotheses.

in this study, we sampled asian shrew-like moles throughout their distribution range, sequenced both mitochondrial and nuclear loci, and adopted molecular phylogenetic and species delimitation approaches to represent a systematic framework of the genus uropsilus. our goals are the following:  to examine the proposed taxonomy based on morphology/morphometrics;  to assess the evolutionary relationships among living taxa; and  to test alternative scenarios of species/diversification patterns within the genus.

RESULTS
sequence characteristics
we obtained  <dig>  bp sequences for each voucher specimen, including  <dig>  bp mitochondrial  and  <dig>  bp nuclear  sequences. a total of  <dig> sequences were deposited in genbank with accession nos. from kf <dig> to kf <dig> . no premature stop codon was observed in the coding regions of the protein coding genes examined. the mitochondrial genes showed relatively higher genetic polymorphisms than the nuclear genes . note that the bmi <dig> gene had no variable site and was thus not used in the species delimitation or network tree reconstruction.

gene trees and divergence times
the bayesian and maximum likelihood  phylogenetic reconstructions recovered very similar topologies; only the ml gene trees are shown . in addition to u. aequodonenia and u. andersoni,  <dig> distinct lineages were recovered in the mitochondrial gene tree , and the monophyly of all these lineages was strongly supported . two of these clades represented u. investigator , two represented u. soricipes , and the others represented u. gracilis . the relationships among the clades were overall strongly supported, except at two nodes. u. aequodonenia and u. andersoni were supported as sister species  and are sister to clade c . u. gracilis was supported as polyphyletic. the nuclear gene tree differed from the mitochondrial gene tree in not recovering the monophyly of clades e, f, and g, even though e + f + g + h was still supported as monophyletic . moreover, clade j was not supported as the sister group of clade i, but is sister to clade e + f + g + h + i . the mitochondrial-nuclear combined gene tree was very similar to the mitochondrial gene tree  but supported clade c as the sister taxon of the other clades, except clade a + b . the partitioned branch support scores showed that both the mitochondrial and nuclear datasets support all but two relationships each .

the ultrametric tree derived from the divergence time estimation is shown in figure  <dig>  it is noteworthy that all relationships were strongly supported. the most recent common ancestor of uropsilus occurred in the latest miocene , and the following divergences occurred from  <dig>  ma to  <dig>  ma .

species delimitation and species trees
the split recognized clades diverged older than  <dig>  ma as putative species; therefore, all  <dig> monophyletic clades in the ml tree were recognized as putative species . the k2p distance between clades e and f was calculated to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  between i and j. all of the other pairwise distances between the clades are ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the *beast analysis recovered the same topology as the mitochondrial-nuclear concatenated gene tree , which was used as the guide species tree for the bpp analyses. in each bayesian delimitation analysis, the posteriors of all parameters had a high ess ; the results are provided in additional file 5: table s <dig>  when using both mitochondrial and nuclear genes, bpp recognized all  <dig> clades as putative species . however, when using nuclear genes alone, the posterior supports for clades a and b and, i and j as distinct species were much lower . following a conservative approach, we recognized a + b and g + h as single species each. we again reconstructed a species tree using the 8-species scenario, and the topology did not change . in addition, the  <dig> nuclear gene network trees showed that u. investigator did not share any haplotypes with other species/putative species when the other  <dig> species/putative species shared haplotypes in  <dig> to  <dig> genes .

discussion
mitochondrial vs. nuclear genes
although incongruences between mitochondrial and nuclear or between different nuclear genes have been observed in many studies , the mitochondrial gene trees and pbs analyses suggested that in our case mitochondrial genes still represent good genetic markers. when both mitochondrial and nuclear genes alone failed to fully resolve the relationships, combined mitochondrial and nuclear genes using both concatenated and coalescent approaches recovered identical topologies and were robustly supported. it follows that a combination of both rapidly evolving mitochondrial and conservative nuclear genes appears to be the best approach to resolve ancient but closely spaced divergences.

species delimitation and taxonomic reappraisal
the accuracy of molecular species delimitation has been discussed several times  <cit> . bpp has been recognized as the most accurate approach when compared to other coalescent-based methods like abc and spedestem  <cit> . recently, miralles and vences found that the number of putative species strikingly ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  depending on the method implemented  <cit> . although bpp was not recognized as the best approach in their study, the results could be affected by small sample size of each putative species and the small number of loci . despite the uncertainty of the number of putative species recognized, molecular data represent only a crude estimate rather than a final conclusion and should be diagnosed using comprehensive morphological characters.

splits and bpp recognized  <dig> and  <dig> putative species, respectively. it is of note that clades a + b and g + h were recognized as one species each in the bpp analyses, even the pairwise k2p distances of cyt b were higher than  <dig> . this value is higher than the distance between sister species u. aequodonenia and u. andersoni  and the average genetic distance between sister species of mammals . this result may be due to the small sample size of clade a  and potential gene flow  because a and b are sympatrically distributed and g and h were not supported as monophyletic by nuclear genes . on the other hand, u. sp.  <dig>  u. sp.  <dig> were recognized as putative species even though the k2p distance between them and their sister taxa were very low , which might due to mitochondrial introgression or different lineage sorting scenarios. we treated u. spp.  <dig> and  <dig> as putative species here, as the bpp analyses suggested there was no recent gene flow. regardless of the ambiguity of species delimitation, the high pairwise genetic distances and the polyphyly of previously known u. gracilis strongly suggested that number of species of uropsilus has been underestimated.

with respect to the previous taxonomy of uropsilus, dental formulas have been used as a key for species diagnosis. four dental formulas have been observed, and u. gracilis and u. investigator share the same dentition . our results revealed that six polyphyletic taxa  share the same dental formula . within the six species/putative species, clade e was sampled from the type locality of u. gracilis, and can be safely assigned to this species . the type locality of u. investigator is distributed to the west of the mekong river, geographically close to the clades a and b, thus we assigned clade a + b to u. investigator. clades g + h and c consist of populations from the type localities of atronates and nivatus, respectively, and these two taxa should most likely be recognized as valid species. there is no available name for spp. 1– <dig>  and their taxonomic status should be evaluated based on extensive sampling and comprehensive morphological/morphometric comparisons.

divergence pattern of uropsilus
the results of our divergence time estimation suggested that neither the pre-pleistocene speciation nor the pleistocene “speciation pump” hypothesis could exclusively explain the speciation/diversification pattern. indeed, the diversification of uropsilus may have been affected by periodical orogenic processes and climate change. prevailing trends toward cooling and desiccation in the late miocene  and the pliocene/pleistocene boundary  <cit>  have been well documented, and leading to the diversification of humid-dwelling taxa . therefore, global cooling may be responsible for the splits of the asian shrew-like moles at  <dig>  ma and  <dig>  ma. similarly, geological studies have supported rapid uplifts of qtp at  <dig>  ma,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ma  <cit> , which may also have resulted in the diversifications of the genus.

the distribution of different species/putative species showed a strong geographic pattern, which could be partly due to the extremely complex topography, understory habitats, and low dispersal ability of the animals  <cit> . nonetheless, at least four species/putative species, including u. aequodonenia, u. andersoni, u. soricipes, and u. sp. <dig>  are distributed in the western sichuan mountains, indicating a very complex geographic history. extensive sampling is required to uncover the vicariant, migration, and speciation history patterns.

cryptic diversity and conservation implications
identifying cryptic diversity is essential for the accurate assessment of genetic diversity and conservation planning  <cit> . cryptic divergence and strong geographic structures have been observed in other endemic taxa  <cit> , indicating that topography has strong effect on diversification, particularly with regard to small and sedentary animals. the current conservation statuses of uropsilus spp. are all considered as “least concern” or “data deficient” , due to their presumed wide distribution and/or large population size  <cit> . however, our results indicated that unrecognized species exist within uropsilus, and most of the species/putative species have very limited distribution. indeed, because of global warming and continuous habitat loss, the species diversity of the genus may be actually threatened. therefore, re-evaluation of the endangered categories relying on a new systematic background is warranted; at present, these putative species should be considered as evolutionary significant units and taken into consideration for conservation planning.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we obtained sequences of uropsilus throughout their distribution in the mountains of southwest china. we reconstructed a robust phylogeny for this most primitive talpid genus and found cryptic diversity. five putative species were determined in addition to the five recognized species. we suggested that atronates and nivatus should be recognized as full species, and a comprehensive morphological diagnosis is warranted for three unidentified species. moreover, the conservation statues should re-evaluated, as most of the species/putative have limited distribution. finally, the divergence of the genus may be affected by climatic changes and tectonic activities, providing clues for the expansion of endemic fauna.
