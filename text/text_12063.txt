BACKGROUND
since the 1990s, body conformation traits have been used in dairy cattle breeding programs in many countries. although these traits themselves are not of economic interest to breeders, they are closely related to many economic traits, such as the health, productivity, and lifetime of cattle. vollema et al.
 <cit>  reported that some conformation traits such as body depth, rump angle, rump width, and udder depth were useful predictors of lifetime and longevity in dutch dairy bull populations because of the genetic correlation between them. lund et al.
 <cit>  showed that genetic correlations between health and type traits were generally moderate  and that selection for improved udder conformation reduced the somatic cell count and the occurrence of clinical mastitis. short and lawlor
 <cit>  found that genetic correlations between linear type traits and first lactation yield ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . pozveh et al. reported that body depth had genetic correlations with many other economic traits, such as the days from calving to first-insemination , calving interval , and gestation length . stature was also genetically correlated with gestation length 
 <cit> . therefore, quantitative trait loci  associated with body conformation traits are economically as important as other economic traits.

with the availability of a high-density chip with single nucleotide polymorphisms  for bovine, genome-wide association study  has become a useful tool for fine-scale qtl mapping. this approach has been widely applied to causative mutation detection in human
 <cit> , mouse
 <cit>  and cattle
 <cit> . by using very large numbers of snps researcher can easily detect statistical associations between snps and phenotypes, and thus biologically meaningful candidate genes close to the significant snps are identified for further study. this procedure greatly narrows down the regions of the genome that contain the causative mutations. the associations can provide direct and necessary evidence for the function of a gene.

recently, many gwass have been focused on the economic traits in dairy cattle, including production traits
 <cit> , fertility traits
 <cit> , disease resistance
 <cit> , and somatic cell score
 <cit> , and many statistically significant snps and biologically meaningful genes have been reported. however, comparatively few studies about body conformation traits have been published
 <cit> . linkage analysis has been used by some researchers to detect qtls associated with conformation traits
 <cit> . schrooten et al.
 <cit>  used microsatellite markers in a whole genome scan for qtls affecting  <dig> conformation traits. ashwell et al.
 <cit>  detected qtls affecting  <dig> conformation traits, including body, udder, feet, legs, and dairy conformation, and found  <dig> chromosome-wise significant qtls. cole et al.
 <cit>  used a single-locus model to analyze  <dig> body conformation traits , which included six trait groups, body size, body shape, udder, teats, teats, feet and legs, and final score and reported the top  <dig> effects for each trait. their results showed that traits within a phenotype group had a tendency of sharing common snp effects.

in this research, we performed a genome wide association study for  <dig> conformation traits in a chinese holstein population, which included  <dig> chinese holstein cattle and  <dig>  snps. a lasso-like multiple-snp method was applied to identify multiple snps simultaneously. the genes closest to the significant snps  were annotated.

methods
blood samples were collected from chinese holstein cattle when the regular quarantine inspection of the farms was conducted. the procedure for collecting the blood samples was carried out in strict accordance with the protocol approved by the animal welfare committee of china agricultural university .

phenotype and genotype data
the chinese holstein population in this study comprised  <dig> chinese holstein cows, the daughters of  <dig> sires. all the cows were from  <dig> dairy cattle farms in the beijing dairy cattle center and the beijing sanyuan lvhe dairy farming center where regular and standard performance tests, including measurement of conformation traits, have been carried out since  <dig> as part of the dairy herd improvement  system. according to the linear classification system defined by dairy data center of china, dairy association of china 
 <cit> ,  <dig> linear type traits were scored from  <dig> to  <dig>  and eight composite traits were measured using an index with values and scored from  <dig> to  <dig>  the  <dig> traits were animal size, stature, height at front end, chest width, body depth, loin strength, rump width, rump angle, bone quality, foot angle, rear legs side view, udder depth, udder texture, median suspensory, fore udder attachment, front teat placement, teat length, rear attachment height, rear attachment width, rear teat placement, and angularity. the eight function score traits were conformation , dairy character, capacity, rump, feet and legs, fore udder, rear udder, and mammary system. calculation of the scores for the eight composite traits was based on linear score, weights, and defective traits. the phenotypic values of the  <dig> conformation traits in the first lactation of the cows were measured by the beijing dairy cattle center
 <cit>  and then the genetic parameters of all  <dig> traits were estimated
 <cit> . the estimated breeding values  were calculated with a multiple-trait random regression test-day model using the runge software purchased from canadian dairy network
 <cit>  by the dairy data center of china. the descriptive statistics of the ebvs for the  <dig> traits in the  <dig> individuals are listed in table 
 <dig>  the genetic correlations between each pair of traits were also calculated . to conveniently generalize the results, the correlation coefficients  were classified into five levels, - <dig> to - <dig> , - <dig>  to - <dig> , - <dig>  to  <dig> ,  <dig>  to  <dig> , and  <dig>  to  <dig>  and were defined as high-level negative correlation, medium-level negative correlation, weak-level correlation, medium-level positive correlation, high-level positive correlation, respectively . the results show that  <dig> of  <dig> pairs of traits  have high-level positive correlations, while most of the pairs have weak correlations .

note: n, sd, min and max means observations, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, respectively.

the animals were genotyped using the illumina bovinesnp <dig> beadchip . some individuals were genotyped using the illumina 54 k chip version <dig> containing  <dig>  snps, while others were genotyped using the 54 k chip version  <dig> containing  <dig>  snps. genotype imputation was conducted for all the genotyped individuals using the beagle software, version  <dig> .0
 <cit> . after imputation, there were  <dig>  snps in the marker data. snps were excluded from the analysis if the minor allele frequency  was less than 1%, the call rate was less than 90%, or the genotype frequency deviated from hardy-weinberg equilibrium  with a p-value lower than 10- <dig>  after quality control,  <dig> individuals with  <dig>  snps remained for the gwas. after editing, the average distance between adjacent snps on the genome was  <dig>  kb, and the median distance was  <dig>  kb. finally, the association analysis was conducted between each trait and  <dig>  snps on  <dig> autosomes and x chromosome in the bovine genome.

statistical analyses
statistical tests of snp effects were conducted using the expectation maximization algorithm based on an improved least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
 <cit>  method. this method simultaneously estimates multiple snp effects and shrinks the effects of zero-effect snps towards zero, and thus avoids complex model selection .

the gwas was carried out in two steps. first, single trait mixed model analysis  was applied to estimate the effect of each snp. then, the first  <dig> markers  with the lowest p-values were selected for the multiple-snp analysis.

the linear model that was used to estimate the effect of the jth snp can be expressed as:

  y=1μ+xjβj+zg+e 

where y is the vector of ebvs,  <dig> is the vector with its elements of  <dig>  μ is the population mean; x
j
 is the vector of the genotype of the jth snp marker, which is assigned to - <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for genotypes aa, ab and bb, respectively, and β
j
is the snp effect; g is the vector of polygenic effects, and z is the design matrix related to the polygenic effect; e is the vector of random residuals. it is assumed that
g~n <dig> aσg <dig> and
e~n <dig> iσe <dig>  where a is the additive genetic relationship matrix based on pedigree,
σg <dig> is the variance of polygenic effect, i is an identity matrix, and
σe <dig> is the residual variance. when a single-snp mixed model was applied, the computational time was extremely large because of the iterative calculation of variance components . therefore, we first approximately calculated the variance components without considering a qtl effect and then imposed the estimates of variance components on the mixed model equation, which does not need an iterative calculation and thus reduces computational time.

for the smma analysis, the significance of the snp effect was tested using a t-test with null hypothesis of β=  <dig>  and the bonferroni correction was applied to control the false positives. so, the threshold for significant associations was –log <dig> , where n is the number of snp loci tested in the analysis.

the model to estimated effects of the snps selected from the first step can be expressed as:

  y=1μ+xβ+zg+e 

where x is the matrix of genotype covariables of the  <dig> snps, and β is the vector of snp effects. an expectation-maximization algorithm was adopted to estimate the model parameters. the method assigned an improved lasso prior
πβj=λj2e-λjβj to snp effect β
j
 <cit> , where the hyper-parameter
λj2/ <dig> is assigned a conjugate gamma prior with gamma , where a and b are very small values, and both a and b are taken as 10- <dig>  the prior of the residual polygenic effect follows the normal distribution
gσg2~n <dig> aσg <dig>  where
σg <dig> is the residual polygenic variance and a is the additive genetic relationship matrix. the expectation-maximization algorithm was applied to estimate snp effects β
j
 by finding the maximum posterior mode, which treats the polygenic effect  as a missing variable .

the threshold value for declaring the significance of the snp was determined from the empirical distribution of the heritability of snp j ,
hj2=σj2/∑j=1pσj2+σg2+σe <dig>  derived from  <dig>  permutations, where
σj2=2pj1-pjβj <dig> is the variance of the jth snp, and p
j
 is the allele frequency of the snp. here, heritability was used to measure the strength of each snp, which is fairer than using the snp effect, because the allele frequency of each snp is different.

identification of snp locations and gene annotation
the locations of significant snps were reported based on the umd <dig>  assembly of bovine genome sequence  at university of maryland). the genes that were closest to the significant snps  were determined by the national animal genome research program
 <cit>  and the national center for biotechnology information
 <cit> ).

RESULTS

discussion
in this study, we performed a gwas for  <dig> conformation traits in a population of chinese holstein cows. a two-step strategy was applied to estimate snp effect, and first we selected  <dig> snps using smma. we originally planned to select snps with p-values <  <dig>   > 2), and we found that about  <dig> snps met this condition for the  <dig> traits  values at the 500th marker were sorted into descending order for the  <dig> traits and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> ). therefore, we decided to use the top  <dig> snps for the multiple qtl analysis. in other words, the selected  <dig> snps include nearly all the snps with p-values <  <dig> .

we found five snps located within previously reported qtl regions that were associated with conformation-related traits. the snp on bta <dig> associated with angularity is 261 kb away from htr2a and is located within a qtl region that has been reported by schrooten et al.
 <cit>  to be associated with angularity. the snp on bta <dig> associated with stature is 81 kb away from loc <dig> and is within a large qtl region that has been found to significantly affect angus body height at maturity
 <cit> . the snp on bta <dig> associated with rear leg side view is near znf <dig> and is within a qtl region that has been reported to have a significant effect on dairy cattle rear leg set
 <cit> . the snp on bta <dig> associated with teat length is near pdia <dig> and is located within a qtl region that has been shown to have a significant effect on teat length
 <cit> . and, the snp on bta <dig> associated with animal size is near tmem <dig> and is within a qtl region that has been reported to affecting calf size in danish holstein cattle
 <cit> . besides, most of significant snps that we detected in this study are located within qtl regions that have been reported previously to affect production, longevity, and reproduction traits in dairy cattle
 <cit> .

we also found several snps located within genes that are known to have functions related to the development and metabolism of animal tissues. the snp  on bta <dig> which was associated with both capacity and body depth is 7 kb away from the gene, duffy blood group, chemokine receptor . hai et al.
 <cit>  performed a bivariate gwas in human to identify the snps associated with lean body mass and age at menarche and reported that darc may play an important role in regulating the metabolisms of both these traits. the snp  on bta <dig> associated with chest width is 121 kb away from the growth arrest specific  <dig>  gene. gas <dig> is highly expressed in quiescent mammalian cells and its over-expression in normal and some cancer cell lines was reported to inhibit g0/g <dig> transition
 <cit> . it was found that gas <dig> was expressed by chondrocytes after the cartilage started to differentiate
 <cit> . the snp on bta <dig> associated with foot angle is 37 kb away from the myotrophin  gene, which plays an important role in cell and skeletal muscle growth
 <cit> . these genes are suggested as functional candidate genes for body conformation traits.

generally, different snps are associated with different traits, but some snps have been found to affect more than one trait. in our study, snp hapmap40339-bta- <dig>  was associated with both capacity and body depth, snp ars-bfgl-ngs- <dig>  was associated with both capacity and animal size, snp ars-bfgl-ngs- <dig>  was associated with both dairy character and angularity, and snp btb- <dig>  was associated with both dairy character and height at front end. the genetic correlation between each of these pairs of genes was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , which suggested that these four snps likely contribute to genetic correlation and perhaps have a pleiotropic effect on each pair of traits.

CONCLUSIONS
the present genome-wide association study identified  <dig> significant snps associated with  <dig> conformation traits in a chinese holstein cattle population. some of these snps were located within or near previously reported genes and qtl regions, while some of the snps were new discoveries. we found that darc, gas <dig>  mtpn, htr2a, znf <dig>  pdia <dig>  and tmem <dig> were the most promising candidate genes for capacity and body depth, chest width, foot angle, angularity, rear leg side view, teat length, and animal size traits, respectively.
