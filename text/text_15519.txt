BACKGROUND
blackcurrant  is grown widely throughout temperate areas of europe and new zealand, with an annual production of  <dig>  tonnes in europe and  <dig>  tonnes globally  <cit> . the centres of genetic diversity for blackcurrant are situated in northern scandinavia and russia, although species are also found in north and south america, asia and northwest africa  <cit> . the fruit has very high nutritional value, in terms of the content of ascorbic acid and other antioxidants  <cit> , and its primary commercial use is processing for juice. in the uk, varieties are chosen to give a spread of cropping seasons. timing of leaf budbreak is an important physiological factor in the developmental processes leading to cropping of blackcurrant, as uniformity of development is essential for both successful harvesting and for optimum fruit quality and yield.

the control of budbreak in many woody perennial plants, including berry fruits such as ribes and rubus, is dependent on exposure to chilling temperatures during the winter for a sufficient duration to release dormancy, followed by appropriate warmer temperatures in the spring to induce growth  <cit> . an insufficient amount of chilling during the dormant period can seriously impact key phenological traits, notably time of budbreak, time and duration of flowering and fruit quality at harvest  <cit> . the chilling requirement, in terms of both duration and range of suitable temperatures, varies between species, between cultivars within species  <cit> , and even between different buds of the same plant  <cit> . blackcurrant has a relatively high chilling requirement for dormancy break, from ca.  <dig>  h in the case of new zealand-selected germplasm  <cit>  to over  <dig>  h for some late-flowering types such as 'ben lomond' from scotland and most nordic cultivars  <cit> . as warmer winters are likely to become increasingly prevalent  <cit> , there is a risk of insufficient chilling becoming more widespread in cultivars requiring high levels of winter chilling, so breeding strategies to address this using low-chill parental material are now required  <cit> .

however, these must be balanced against the risk of spring frost damage at flowering in cultivars that break bud too early after minimal chilling and whilst the incidence of spring frosts is declining across europe  <cit> , there can still be occasional damage in some areas. also, the risk of spring frost damage at flowering may depend on temperature variance as well as on specific mean temperatures, and climate projections are predicting a future rise in such variance  <cit> .

dormancy in woody perennials is an adaptive mechanism for the survival of winter conditions  <cit>  and was classified by lang  <cit>  into three major types:  ecodormancy, where growth inactivity is caused by unfavourable environmental conditions, with a resumption of growth when conditions improve;  endodormancy, caused by endogenous factors within the dormant buds that cannot be overcome even by favourable environmental conditions; and  paradormancy, or correlative inhibition  <cit> , where the dormancy status of buds is influenced by physiological factors in other parts of the plant . the effects of winter chilling on dormancy break at bud-burst are in endodormant tissues, and further investigation of winter chilling in blackcurrant is structured around improved phenotyping of diverse germplasm  <cit>  coupled with genetic analysis of quantitative trait loci  and genes associated with dormancy-related processes. putative qtl linked to key developmental traits, including time of budbreak, have recently been identified by brennan et al.  <cit> .

dormancy break and subsequent physiological events are controlled through the coordinated action of large numbers of genes in woody plants  <cit>  and whilst there have been many studies of the molecular genetics of dormancy and budbreak, many aspects remain unclear. microarray studies to examine global gene expression during dormancy and budbreak have been used in a range of woody genera, including vitis,  <cit> , quercus  <cit>  and rubus  <cit> . most of these studies attempted functional classification of the differentially expressed genes from the transcriptome related to budbreak or, in the case of mathiason et al.  <cit> , to the fulfilment of chilling requirement. some studies, eg. mazzitelli et al.  <cit>  and derory et al.  <cit> , have identified candidate genes for dormancy-related metabolism, and several of these genes were previously implicated in these processes in other species.

the aim of this study was to examine patterns of gene expression in leaf buds of blackcurrant and to identify the key differential changes in these profiles around the time of budbreak. a custom cdna microarray was utilised which incorporated blackcurrant expressed sequence tags  derived from buds at various stages of dormancy. expression profiling identified candidate genes associated with budbreak which were mapped onto a blackcurrant genetic linkage map. initial steps have been taken to develop associated markers that can be deployed in the characterisation of diverse germplasm for inclusion in downstream breeding programmes.

RESULTS
blackcurrant expressed sequence tags
rna was isolated from blackcurrant leaf bud tissue sampled at five time-points prior to budbreak and, following pooling, was used to construct a targeted cdna library to maximise collation of relevant ests. single-pass sequencing of approximately  <dig>  clones generated  <dig>  high-quality ests. following identification of a low-redundancy set of blackcurrant clones, single ests  representing each contiguous sequence were selected and whole cdna inserts used to fabricate microarrays as described.

gene expression profiling during dormancy transition
leaf buds were sampled from blackcurrant plants throughout the different dormancy phases, from mid-winter following onset of dormancy through to spring when bud-burst was prevalent. rna was isolated from bud samples from winter  <dig> to spring 2006: week  <dig> , week  <dig>  week  <dig>  week  <dig>  week  <dig>  week  <dig> and week  <dig> . for the microarray experimental design, rnas from consecutive time-points were hybridised on the same arrays in a two-channel loop-design . data were extracted from each array and quality filtering was applied to leave  <dig>  reliable replicated expressed probes.

in order to identify and characterise variation within the entire reliable dataset principal component analysis  was used . principal component  <dig> accounted for 66% of the variance, whereas principal component  <dig> comprised 12% of the variance, based upon the filtered genelist of  <dig>  probes. principal component  <dig> separates the samples of the earlier weeks  from those of the later weeks . principal component  <dig> in particular separates the week  <dig> data from the other time points. to analyse this further, an overview of gene activity in blackcurrant leaf bud tissue was obtained using volcano plots to identify numbers of differentially expressed genes between consecutive sample time points . early winter  shows the lowest levels of differential gene expression, and in the first two weeks of sampling the majority of genes are down-regulated. differential gene expression reaches a peak between week  <dig> and week  <dig>  with similar numbers of up-and down-regulated genes detected. subsequently, the majority of genes from week  <dig> to week  <dig> are reduced in expression levels. 

significant differentially expressed genes were identified over the entire period of sampling using analysis of variance . false discovery rate  was applied at high stringency multiple testing correction; identifying  <dig>  significantly changing probes , of which  <dig> unigenes have significant homology to known arabidopsis gene loci. the high proportion of significantly changing genes reflects our generation and use of a microarray targeted to dormancy processes in ribes. unigenes considered to have significantly changing gene expression profiles following anova analysis were subjected to k-means clustering to group similarly regulated genes together . for simplicity, average gene expression profiles are shown for each group to indicate general trends. the four groups obtained  consist of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes respectively. 

to obtain a general overview of putative gene function within significant gene clusters, individual gene sets were analysed for enrichment of gene ontology  terms using the term enrichment tool at amigo  <cit> . frequencies of go categories within the blackcurrant homologue lists were compared to those found in the whole microarray set and these are represented in additional file  <dig>  all four groups showed significant enrichment of go terms, thereby linking putative function with temporal gene expression patterns: set  <dig> shows a gradual and consistent increase from week  <dig> to week  <dig>  followed by more rapid induction to week  <dig>  and the majority of overrepresented terms in this group appear to be associated with protein biosynthesis and metabolism. set  <dig> does not show induction until week  <dig>  increasing rapidly through the remaining sample points, and this group also shows enrichment for general cellular metabolism and biosynthesis, but also contains terms related to photosynthesis. set  <dig> shows initial reduction in expression from week  <dig> to week  <dig> and is subsequently induced dramatically from week  <dig>  and the majority of terms overrepresented in this group are associated with secondary metabolism. set  <dig> shows gradual down-regulation from week  <dig> to week  <dig>  followed by rapid decline through to week  <dig>  and this set is enriched for transcription factor  terms. individual genes and their homologies will be discussed in the context of specific metabolic processes and putative biological function later in this manuscript.

validation of microarray gene expression profiling
in order to validate gene expression profiles obtained from the microarray data, a subset of eighteen genes were identified from the significant anova gene-list with contrasting patterns and magnitude of regulation. sequences from the associated ests were used to design real-time rt-pcr assays . comparison of gene expression profiles between microarray data and real-time rt-pcr data is presented in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  indicating clear correspondence between the two independent expression technologies in the context of this study.

genetic mapping and association of candidate genes with dormancy traits
in order to map candidate genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms  or simple sequence repeats  were identified from the candidate genes using genomic dna from parents and progeny of a well characterised mapping population  which segregates for several qtl, some of which are directly related to budbreak and dormancy characters  <cit> . a subset of ests was selected from the significant gene-lists for full-insert sequencing . selection was based upon levels of significance with respect to differential gene expression and ability to define putative annotation from gene homologues. primers were designed to original est sequences for  <dig>  genes. single pcr products were successfully amplified from  <dig> of these, of which  <dig> sequences were polymorphic, with at least one snp per sequence. pyrosequencing assays were designed to  <dig> of these snps for subsequent mapping in the complete blackcurrant population. from these,  <dig> snp-markers segregated in the expected ratios  if just one parent was heterozygous, or 1:2: <dig>  if both parents were heterozygous) among the progeny and were mapped to the linkage map . as well as snps, we also identified ssrs for which primers could be designed to  <dig> of the  <dig> genes. these were tested on the mapping population and, of the three which generated polymorphic loci, two were mapped to genetic locations on the linkage map .

quantitative trait loci interval mapping previously identified a qtl for budbreak in  <dig> on linkage group  <dig>  <cit> , a region which also contains serb09l <dig>  and serb03c <dig> . the recombination frequency between these snp-markers was zero. the maximum lod  of odds) score in this region was  <dig> . in  <dig>  the lod score for budbreak in this region was less than the usual threshold of  <dig> , but the qtl effect was the same sign  <cit> . a more powerful qtl by environment  analysis of the combined  <dig> and  <dig> data  <cit>  showed that serb09l <dig>  and serb03c <dig>  were significantly associated with budbreak  and that there was no significant qtl by year interaction. the mean budbreak for the heterozygous genotype at these snps was  <dig>  days  earlier than the homozygote in  <dig> and  <dig>   earlier in  <dig>  these two ests encode proteins with homology to an acetyl-coa carboxylase  and a calmodulin-binding protein , respectively. another est, serb02k <dig>  on linkage group  <dig>  was found using the qtl by environment analysis to be associated with budbreak . the mean budbreak for the heterozygous genotype at this snp was  <dig>  days  later than the homozygote in  <dig> and  <dig>   later in  <dig>  this has derived amino acid homology to a beta-tubulin . specific gene expression profiles, including quantitative rt-pcr validation, is presented in figure  <dig> and indicates that the genes encoding acetyl-coa carboxylase and beta-tubulin have similar patterns, with relatively constant expression to week  <dig>  followed by rapid accumulation of transcripts later in the time course. the gene encoding the calmodulin-binding protein however, initially dips in activity at week  <dig>  recovers and gradually declines through the remainder of the sampling period.

discussion
the need for blackcurrant varieties requiring lower levels of chilling during the dormant period is likely to increase in the future  <cit> , although current unpredictability of weather events in many of the growing regions means that utilising a range of varieties with varying chilling requirements is probably advisable for most growers. for example, varieties that break bud too early may be vulnerable to damage by spring frosts during the flowering period in some northern areas, notably scandinavia  <cit> . however, the selection of varieties based on budbreak characteristics currently depends largely on phenotypic assessments in the field using prevailing weather conditions. to move beyond this into a more focused selection procedure requires detailed knowledge about the genetic control of budbreak and subsequent developmental events in blackcurrant, which will enable development of molecular markers directly linked to traits of interest.

general observations of gene activity in blackcurrant bud tissue
this study provides insight into the genetic components associated with dormancy transition in blackcurrant. a targeted blackcurrant cdna microarray was constructed and utilised to identify sets of genes with significant differential expression profiles during dormancy release and budbreak. utilising pca and identifying differentially expressed probes between sampling stages clearly indicated maximum gene activity between week  <dig> and week  <dig> , during the month of february. this was also demonstrated in all four of the primary gene expression profiles determined by k-means clustering , with rapid induction or repression after week  <dig>  up to this point, the cumulative chilling  was  <dig>  h , similar levels to which have been demonstrated under controlled environments in rubus to develop 50-100% budburst in whole canes or isolated nodes respectively  <cit> . this was slightly lower than that estimated by fraser  <cit>  using cuttings, rather than whole plants, which indicated the chilling requirements of commercial uk cultivars of blackcurrant, including 'ben gairn' and 'ben hope', to be >  <dig> h. in vitis riparia, almost 100% budburst was achieved in canes after  <dig>  h of chilling  <cit> . accumulated hours of chilling in our study would indicate that our material received sufficient chilling for budbreak between week  <dig> and week  <dig> and, combined with the general observations in gene expression profiles, suggest that the blackcurrant samples include bud material in transition from the endodormant to ecodormant phases  <cit> .

putative roles of the significantly changing genes during dormancy release from this study remain speculative and care must be taken in interpreting the data, however a number of gene homologues identified have been previously described in several related studies. some of these common genes of interest are briefly discussed in the context of dormancy transition and budbreak.

association of dormancy transition with signalling, transcription factors and secondary metabolism
almost half of the significant differentially expressed blackcurrant genes clustered into expression profile set  <dig> , whereby gene activity in general was highest in early winter, subsequently declining throughout the remaining sampling period into spring-time. this set was overrepresented by go terms associated with transcription factors . of note within this group are genes encoding tfs , of which there are several zinc finger family members  which are known to play important roles in signal transduction pathways of plants  <cit> . a zinc finger protein from quercus  <cit>  has been implicated in budburst, which is related to a tf involved in seed germination from arabidopsis  <cit> . another class of tf which shows gradual down-regulation through the time course in ribes encodes a short vegetative phase  type mads box transcription factor . homologues of svp have been identified in japanese apricot  <cit>  and raspberry  <cit> , where the gene has similar expression patterns to that observed in blackcurrant under controlled conditions leading to dormancy release. svp has been shown in arabidopsis to act as a direct repressor of flowering  <cit>  and appears to have elevated expression under short-day environments  <cit> . a tf family highly related to svp, termed dormancy associated mads-box , has been described in several other perennial species, including poplar  <cit> , leafy spurge  <cit>  and peach  <cit> . expression of two leafy spurge genes encoding dam proteins reflect the dormancy status within the leaf meristem, with both genes induced by cold temperatures and differentially expressed according to day length. mads-box tfs are clearly important components in signalling and dormancy transition in several species.

oxidative stress has been reported to be an important factor in controlling budbreak, and induction of dormancy release by artificial stimuli, such as heat stress and hydrogen cyanamide, leads to the differential expression of several genes associated with this process in grape  <cit> . from the blackcurrant array data, there is evidence of transient expression of several genes whose products are coupled with this mechanism , including ascorbate peroxidase , calcium-dependent protein kinases , glutathione s-transferases , catalase  and sucrose synthase . similar mechanisms appear to also be involved in dormancy release of raspberry leaf buds, with transient induction of genes encoding ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and gst  <cit> . other signalling systems, demonstrated by artificial dormancy control in grape, involve ethylene and abscisic acid , leading to the hypothesis that there is complex interaction between these mechanisms to control dormancy release  <cit> . within the blackcurrant data, there is evidence of ethylene signalling during transition with transient expression of several ethylene response factors , which have also been observed in leafy spurge  <cit> . many of the blackcurrant genes strongly induced later in the time-course  are associated with secondary metabolism, specifically those leading to flavonoid biosynthesis. these include genes encoding chalcone isomerase, chalcone synthase, dihydroflavonol reductase and flavonol synthase , some of which have also been reported to be significantly regulated during dormancy release in raspberry  <cit>  and leafy spurge  <cit> . flavonoids provide protection of tissues against uv damage  and are known to control auxin transport in plants, subsequently altering growth of tissues such as axillary buds  <cit> .

candidate genes associated with dormancy traits
genetic mapping of significantly expressed ests enabled identification of three genes which co-localise with previously characterised blackcurrant budbreak qtl  <cit> , two of which map with high significance to a single locus on linkage group  <dig> and another which maps to linkage group  <dig> . these associations provide independent evidence that these genes may be implicated in dormancy processes, however it should be noted that they may also be simply co-located with the causal genes. each of these ests is discussed on the basis of their homologies to known genes and gene products, and in the context of previous work on dormancy in other species. 

acetyl coa carboxylase  functions to provide malonyl-coa as a substrate for biosynthesis of fatty acids  <cit>  and secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids and anthocyanins  <cit>  which are essential for plant development and protection. it is known that the homomeric form is induced by uv-b radiation for flavonoid production  <cit> . the gene expression profile derived from this est  is a member of set  <dig> of the clustered groups , which has overrepresentation of terms associated with secondary metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. accase is associated with rapidly dividing tissues and early stages of cell growth and development and this gene is clearly induced in expression during early spring. in addition, an accase has been shown to be induced in floral buds of common bean  <cit> .

clone gt <dig> encodes a gene product with homology to calmodulin-binding protein. calmodulin itself binds to calcium, which is common regulator of many different protein targets and a transducer of secondary messenger signals  <cit> . as previously mentioned, oxidative stress is also known to induce calcium signalling in plant cells  <cit> . calmodulin-binding proteins exist in many different forms with a range of associated functions and have been demonstrated to control calcium signalling in woody perennial species such as grape  <cit>  and blueberry  <cit> . the expression profile of the gene in blackcurrant  indicates repression from week  <dig> and is present within cluster set  <dig> , which contains other genes with go terms associated with transcription factors. the polypeptide encoded by this gene also shows similarity to a putative pheromone receptor protein ar <dig> in arabidopsis, whose est profiles show high levels of expression in bud and seed tissue .

a third blackcurrant gene , which maps to a budbreak qtl on linkage group  <dig>  encodes a protein with high homology to beta-tubulin, which is an essential component of microtubules within the cytoskeleton. high levels of beta-tubulin expression is a clear indicator of rapidly dividing and expanding cells and the gene expression profile shows rapid induction after week  <dig> . this profile is a member of set  <dig>  which contains many terms representative of increased protein metabolism and biosynthesis. from previous studies, beta-tubulin is consistently induced on dormancy release in buds of a range of woody perennial species, including malus and rosa  <cit> , and is proposed as a genetic marker for dormancy status in such species. it has also been demonstrated that a beta-tubulin gene is induced in expression during bud-burst in poplar  <cit> .

extending this study to look for association of these genes with dormancy-related traits in a wide blackcurrant germplasm collection is planned and will further substantiate their roles in physiological processes related to budbreak. however, it is clear that they have excellent potential as genetic markers to assist future breeding strategies. further work to confirm the genetic map locations for both phenological and fruit quality traits is currently in progress with an extended blackcurrant mapping population and appropriate phenotyping.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides insight into the genetic control of dormancy transition in blackcurrant, and the use of microarrays over a time course leading up to budbreak shows key changes in gene expression at budbreak. further mapping of ests with significant differential changes in expression around budbreak enabled the identification of three genes which co-localise with previously-characterised blackcurrant qtl, and it is concluded that these genes have probable roles in the dormancy and budbreak processes, and can therefore provide a basis for the development of genetic markers for future breeding deployment.
