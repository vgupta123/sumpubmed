BACKGROUND
because plants lack an adaptive immune system, appropriate perceptions and responses of individual cells to various environmental stimuli, such as the biotic stress caused by phytopathogenic microorganisms, are critically important. the plant defense response against biotic stress is triggered by the recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns  or of pathogen strain-specific factors known as elicitors or effectors  <cit> . the response triggered by pamps is known as the basal defense response, whereas that triggered by specific elicitors is known as the hypersensitive response . in the latter, an effector is recognized by a corresponding plant resistance  protein. the hr is frequently accompanied by programmed cell death , which plays a particularly important role in the defense against biotrophic pathogens but is also an essential function in normal plant development and differentiation  <cit> . although many plant components required for the pcd-associated hr have been identified, the entire signaling pathway leading to pcd has not been elucidated.

the mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascade is a highly evolutionarily conserved signal transduction mechanism found in eukaryotic cells. subsequent to activation of the cascade by various extracellular stimuli, the signal is transduced intracellularly by sequential phosphorylation. in plants, mapk cascades are associated with developmental and hormonal responses and with stress responses to abiotic and biotic factors  <cit> . a mapk cascade consists of three functionally linked protein kinases: a mapk is phosphorylated and activated by a mapk kinase , which is in turn activated by an upstream mapk kinase kinase . typical mapk substrates are cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins, such as transcription factors  <cit> . mapkkks are the most divergent of these three types of kinases in plants; the arabidopsis thaliana genome contains approximately  <dig> mapkkks,  <dig> mapkks, and  <dig> mapks  <cit> .

based on phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of their catalytic kinase domains, plant mapkkks have been classified into three groups: a, b, and c  <cit> . group a contains many mapkkks involved in pcd and stress and defense responses; e.g., a. thaliana atmekk <dig> is involved in the signaling pathway of basal defense induced by pamps  <cit> , and medicago sativa msomtk <dig>  <cit>  is involved in that of oxidative stress-induced cell death. group a also includes mapkkks that have important functions in hr induction. silencing of the genes encoding nicotiana tabacum npk <dig>  and nicotiana benthamiana mapkkkα  suppresses the n gene-mediated hr induced by the helicase domain of tobacco mosaic virus  replicase and pto-mediated hr induced by pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  effector avrpto, respectively  <cit> . recently, n. benthamiana nbmapkkkε and its tomato  ortholog slmapkkkε have been implicated in pcd induction in the hr against gram-negative bacterial pathogens  <cit> . in addition, silencing of the genes encoding the mapkk mek <dig> and the mapk sipk, both of which act downstream of nbmapkkkα, also attenuates the n gene-mediated hr against tmv  <cit> . conversely, silencing of the tomato orthologs of mapkk mek <dig> and mapk ntf <dig>  both of whose tobacco orthologs act downstream of ntnpk1in tobacco, leads to loss of the pto-mediated hr in tomato  <cit> . therefore, the ntnpk1- and nbmapkkkα-initiated mapk cascades are essential for both the n gene-mediated and the pto-mediated hr, suggesting that at least two distinct mapk cascades are involved in the regulation of a single hr event  <cit> . furthermore, it is now becoming apparent that two distinct mapk cascades are involved in non-hr environmental responses  <cit> .

plants generally appear to use the same mapkk/mapk sets in different responses to environmental stimuli. the a. thaliana mapkks atmkk <dig> and atmkk <dig> and/or their downstream component mpk <dig> are involved not only in the signaling pathway for basal defense downstream of atmekk <dig> but also in ethylene production and stomata formation  <cit> . given the relatively limited number of mapkks and mapks in plants, the diversity of these responses  is assumed to be possible due to the great diversity of mapkkks  <cit> . therefore, comparative functional analysis among mapkkks is needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying a variety of responses to environmental stresses.

we previously showed that systemic necrosis, the disease symptom caused by plantago asiatica mosaic virus li <dig> , was accompanied by resistance traits similar to hr. using tobacco rattle virus -based virus-induced gene silencing   <cit> , we demonstrated that nbsgt <dig> and nbrar <dig>  which are important in the hr, and the mapk cascade including nbmapkkkα/nbmek <dig>  are essential for the induction of pcd-associated systemic necrosis induced by plamv-li <dig>  <cit> . this result and those described above led us to hypothesize that other mapkkk genes in addition to nbmapkkkα are involved in the systemic necrosis induced by plamv-li <dig> 

in the present study, we isolated three novel group a mapkkk genes from n. benthamiana, a model plant of the family solanaceae, using an expressed sequence-tag  database. the three cloned genes were designated nbmapkkkβ, nbmapkkkγ, and nbmapkkkε <dig>  further study revealed that nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ are positive regulators of pcd. in addition, the results of epistasis analysis performed using vigs and agroinfiltration suggest that two of these mapkkks , together with nbmapkkkα, comprise a linear signaling pathway important in the induction of pcd.

RESULTS
cloning of three novel group a mapkkk genes from nicotiana benthamiana
to conduct a comparative analysis of the roles of mapkkk genes in defense responses, we first sought to clone n. benthamiana mapkkk genes belonging to group a. group a includes four subgroups, a1–a <dig>  and contains many genes involved in plant defense responses. to obtain one n. benthamiana mapkkk gene homolog from each group a subgroup, we selected the following: the arabidopsis mapkkk genes atmekk <dig> <cit> , atmapkkkγ, and atmapkkkε <dig> <cit>  as representatives of the a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> subgroups, respectively. for the a <dig> subgroup, which includes ntnpk <dig>  <cit>  and atanp <dig>  we were able to amplify n. benthamiana cdna fragments using ntnpk1-specific primers; the amplified gene turned out to be  <dig> % identical in nucleotide sequence to that encoding the ntnpk <dig> kinase domain, which has been well characterized for its role in defense responses  <cit> . therefore, the a <dig> subgroup was excluded from further study.

using the nucleotide sequences encoding the highly conserved kinase domains of atmekk <dig>  <cit> , atmapkkkγ, and atmapkkkε <dig> as queries for blast searches against the n. benthamiana, n. tabacum, and solanum lycopersicum est databases, we obtained three est sequences: n. benthamiana tc <dig>  n. tabacum bp <dig>  and s. lycopersicum bi <dig>  respectively. based on these sequences, we designed specific primers to isolate full-length n. benthamiana mapkkk cdna clones, as described in the materials and methods. the cloned n. benthamiana mapkkk genes are predicted to encode proteins with highly conserved kinase domains and more divergence in other regions, a general feature of plant mapkkk genes  <cit> .

next, we used the amino acid sequences of the kinase domains of our newly cloned mapkkks and those of other previously identified mapkkks to construct a phylogenetic tree . our newly cloned mapkkk genes were tentatively designated after the name of the most closely related genes in the phylogenetic tree. thus, our a <dig> mapkkk homolog was designated nbmapkkkγ after a. thaliana atmapkkkγ. at a late phase of this study, an a <dig> mapkkk homolog, n. benthamiana nbmapkkkε, was reported  <cit> . although our a <dig> homolog shares high sequence similarity with nbmapkkkε, the genes were not identical  and differed in length. because these results indicated that a <dig> mapkkk homologs in n. benthamiana consisted of at least two genes, our a <dig> homolog was designated nbmapkkkε <dig> after nbmapkkkε. in fact, from the recently released n. benthamiana draft genome sequence , only two contigs that show high sequence homology  with nbmapkkkε <dig> were retrieved and each of these sequences corresponded to nbmapkkkε <dig> and nbmapkkkε, respectively. although our a <dig> mapkkk homolog was most closely related to msomtk <dig>  which was designated after the functional features of its gene products, designating this gene “nbomtk1” was apparently incorrect, as we do not know if our a <dig> homologous gene product and msomtk <dig> have a similar function. the next most closely related genes were atmekk <dig> and brassica napus bnmapkkkβ <dig>  therefore, our a <dig> homolog was designated nbmapkkkβ after bnmapkkkβ <dig>  a gene of the a <dig> subgroup, in accordance with other newly cloned genes nbmapkkkγ and nbmapkkkε <dig>  the nbmapkkkβ, nbmapkkkγ, and nbmapkkkε <dig> cdna sequences determined in this study were deposited in the dna data bank of japan  under the accession numbers ab <dig>  ab <dig>  and ab <dig>  respectively.

the domain structures of the three novel mapkkk genes are shown in figure 1b. the nbmapkkkβ, nbmapkkkγ, and nbmapkkkε <dig> cdna are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp in length, respectively, and are respectively predicted to encode proteins of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids. kinase domains are found in the c-terminal regions of nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ and the n-terminal region of nbmapkkkε <dig>  the c-terminal region of nbmapkkkε <dig> contains two arm  domains. the domain structures of these proteins are similar to those of their respective a. thaliana homologs.

overexpression of the nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ kinase domains, but not the nbmapkkkε <dig> kinase domain, causes cell death
overexpression of the kinase domain of the tomato homolog of nbmapkkkα, slmapkkkα, in n. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration has been reported to induce pathogen-independent cell death  <cit> . to investigate whether our three newly identified mapkkks also possessed cell death-inducing activity, we performed transient overexpression analysis of each kinase domain using agroinfiltration. the transient overexpression of the kinase domains of nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ induced pathogen-independent cell death in the infiltrated area . in the infiltrated areas, cell death was associated with significant hydrogen peroxide production, which is detected by a characteristic brown color that emerges upon  <dig> '-diaminobenzidine  staining. these results were confirmed by measuring the extent of cell death using an ion leakage assay , which showed significantly increased ion leakage in the nbmapkkkβ- and nbmapkkkγ-overexpressing areas. no significant difference in the level of ion leakage was observed for nbmapkkkβ vs. nbmapkkkγ. in contrast, overexpression of the kinase domain of nbmapkkkε <dig> failed to induce cell death or hydrogen peroxide production and failed to increase the level of ion leakage. western blot analysis using anti-myc monoclonal antibody  was performed to assess the expression levels of these kinase domains . specific signals of nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkε <dig> kinase domains were detected, but no accumulation of nbmapkkkγ kinase domain was found. however, we suppose that the nbmapkkkγ kinase domain was accurately expressed, even at very low levels, because its overexpression rapidly induced cell death. western blot analysis also showed that the accumulated expression level of nbmapkkkε <dig> kinase domain, whose overexpression did not induce cell death, was much greater than the expression levels of the nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ kinase domains. because these results indicated that nbmapkkkε <dig> is not involved in the induction of pathogen-independent cell death, we excluded nbmapkkkε <dig> from further analysis.

overexpression of full-length, catalytically active nbmapkkkβ or nbmapkkkγ causes cell death
to further investigate the involvement of nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ in pathogen-independent cell death, we conducted transient overexpression experiments using their full-length open reading frames . as shown in figure 2d, overexpression of nbmapkkkβ or nbmapkkkγ induced cell death. the observed level of ion leakage was similar for overexpression of nbmapkkkβ, nbmapkkkγ, and nbmapkkkα, which was used as a positive control .

several previous studies have demonstrated that kinase activity is required for the triggering of pathogen-independent cell death by transient overexpression of a component of a mapk cascade  <cit> . to examine whether nbmapkkkβ- and nbmapkkkγ-induced cell death also required kinase activity, we constructed full-length and kinase domain mapkkk mutants deficient in atp binding. in these mutants, the essential conserved lysine residue  in the atp-binding site of the kinase domain was replaced with a methionine   <cit> . as shown in figure 2a and 2d, none of these k → m mutants induced cell death when overexpressed. this result was confirmed by dab staining  and ion leakage assays . also, the expression of these kinase domain k → m mutants was confirmed by western blot analysis with anti-myc monoclonal antibody . these results indicate that cell death induced by the transient overexpression of n. benthamiana nbmapkkkβ or nbmapkkkγ is dependent on their kinase activities.

silencing of nbmapkkkβ or nbmapkkkγ suppresses plamv-li1-induced pcd
in light of the above finding that overexpression of full-length nbmapkkkβ or nbmapkkkγ or their kinase domains can induce cell death, we expected that silencing of the genes encoding these mapkkks would suppress virally induced pcd. therefore, we used a trv-based vigs system  <cit>  to silence nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ. successful silencing of each gene was confirmed by analyzing the expression of nbmapkkkβ, nbmapkkkγ, and nbmapkkkα  using real-time reverse transcription -pcr analysis . also, southern blot analyses using a kinase domain-specific probe of each gene revealed that nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ exist as single-copy and multiple-copy genes, respectively, in the n. benthamiana genome . in the n. benthamiana draft genome, two contigs showing high sequence homology  with nbmapkkkγ were obtained, suggesting that there are at least two copies of nbmapkkkγ homologs. thus, we assume that a single gene is specifically targeted in nbmapkkkβ-silenced plants, but one or more highly similar genes might be targeted in nbmapkkkγ-silenced plants. hereafter, we use the term “nbmapkkkγ” to indicate nbmapkkkγ and/or its homologous gene except for transient overexpression experiments. the gene-silenced plants did not display any obvious phenotypic differences compared with non-silenced  control plants , suggesting that neither nbmapkkkβ nor nbmapkkkγ is involved in normal plant growth and development. in contrast, silencing of ntnpk <dig>  a mapkkk involved in cell plate formation in plant cytokinesis and in n gene-mediated hr cell death, causes severe stunting of plants  <cit> .

nbmapkkkβ- and nbmapkkkγ-silenced plants and control non-silenced plants were subsequently inoculated with plamv-li <dig>  which induces pcd-associated necrosis in n. benthamiana. in the plamv-li1-infiltrated areas of non-silenced plants, we observed characteristic necrotic symptoms and brown color staining, indicating the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. however, in the li1-infiltrated nbmapkkkβ-silenced plants, cell death and hydrogen peroxide production were completely compromised. also, in nbmapkkkγ-silenced plants, cell death and hydrogen peroxide production were suppressed completely and partially, respectively, despite only about 20% decrease in the abundance of nbmapkkkγ transcripts . suppression of cell death in the nbmapkkkβ- and nbmapkkkγ-silenced plants was confirmed using ion leakage assays . the suppression of cell death in nbmapkkkγ-silenced plants despite the slight decrease in its mrna can be explained by a strict requirement of a high level of nbmapkkkγ protein in cell death. although it is possible that residual nbmapkkkγ protein contributes to the decreased level of hydrogen peroxide production, its level might be too low to induce cell death. these results indicate that nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ are involved in hydrogen peroxide production and pcd induced by plamv-li <dig> 

nbmapkkkα, nbmapkkkβ, and nbmapkkkβ form a linear signaling pathway that induces cell death
together with the findings of our previous study showing that nbmapkkkα is involved in plamv-li1-induced pcd  <cit> , the above findings demonstrate that nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ are also essential for this virally induced pcd. to determine the relationships among these three genes in the pcd signaling pathway, we designed epistasis experiments combining transient overexpression and silencing of combinations of these genes. in these experiments, plants with a specific vigs-silenced mapkkk gene were agroinfiltrated with an agrobacterium culture expressing a different mapkkk gene, and the level of ion leakage was measured. prior to the epistasis experiments, a preliminary experiment was performed to determine the minimum turbidity of agrobacterium inoculum for each gene sufficient to induce complete cell death. complete cell death was observed at the following cell densities at od600:  <dig> , nbmapkkkα;  <dig> , nbmapkkkβ; and  <dig> , nbmapkkkγ. although each mapkkk was overexpressed at different concentrations of agrobacterium inocula, no significant difference in the basal ion leakage level was observed among the different turbidities  of agrobacterium inocula that expressed the gus gene in wild-type plants . for nbmapkkkβ, cell death induced by both the full-length orf and kinase domain was slow and weak, but cell death induced by the kinase domain was more often observed than that induced by the full-length orf. in the ion leakage assay shown in figure 2b, this tendency was detected, although the difference in cell death induced by the full-length orf and kinase domain of nbmapkkkβ was not statistically significant. previous reports have shown that the substrate specificity of mapkkk is not affected when only the kinase domain is transiently activated  <cit> . hence, the kinase domain of nbmapkkkβ was used for further analysis, instead of the full-length orf.

as shown in figure 4a, ion leakage levels induced by transient expression of the nbmapkkkβ kinase domain or full-length nbmapkkkγ were lower in nbmapkkkα-silenced plants than in vigs vector-only control plants. cell death induced by both nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ was consistently significantly suppressed in nbmapkkkα-silenced plants compared to control plants . this result suggests that nbmapkkkα either acts downstream of both nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ in cell death induction or plays an essential role in codependent activation of both nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ. in contrast, the ion leakage levels induced by transient expression of full-length nbmapkkkα or nbmapkkkγ were similar in nbmapkkkβ-silenced plants and control plants , suggesting that nbmapkkkα and nbmapkkkβ are not codependent in their activation; rather, nbmapkkkβ functions upstream of nbmapkkkα in the cell death signaling pathway. this result led us to postulate that nbmapkkkβ functions upstream of nbmapkkkγ. as expected, in nbmapkkkγ-silenced plants, cell death and the ion leakage level induced by the transient overexpression of the nbmapkkkβ kinase domain were significantly compromised compared to control plants . cell death and the ion leakage induced by transient overexpression of nbmapkkkα, however, were similar in nbmapkkkγ-silenced and control plants , confirming that nbmapkkkβ functions upstream of nbmapkkkγ and that nbmapkkkγ functions upstream of nbmapkkkα. in this epistasis analysis, ion leakage levels were closely associated with the intensity of cell death at all combinations of these genes. thus, these three mapkkk genes form a linear signaling pathway leading to pcd in which nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkα function as the furthest upstream and downstream components, respectively, of the three mapkkk components.

discussion
in our previous study  <cit> , we showed that a mapk cascade including nbmapkkkα and nbmek <dig> is required for both the pcd-associated systemic necrosis induced by plamv-li <dig> and the rx-mediated hr against potato virus x. several studies have demonstrated that at least two mapk cascades are involved in plant responses to various environmental stimuli  <cit> . the great diversity of plant mapkkk genes is assumed to underlie the ability of plants to mount specific signaling responses to various environmental stimuli  <cit> . therefore, to better understand the functions of mapkkks in the induction of pcd, we performed a comparative functional analysis of n. benthamiana mapkkk genes. in the previous and present study, we demonstrated that three of these genes, nbmapkkkα <cit> , nbmapkkkβ, and nbmapkkkγ , function as positive regulators of plamv-li1-induced pcd and are not functionally redundant in the cell death signaling pathway. in the vigs experiments, not only nbmapkkkγ but also its homologous gene were presumably knocked down in trv-nbmapkkkγ-infected plants. however, only one gene in the a <dig> subgroup was obtained from the cloning experiments, suggesting that nbmapkkkγ homologous gene, which carries almost the same sequence as nbmapkkkγ itself, must be effectively knocked down in trv-nbmapkkkγ-infected plants. in addition, overexpression of the nbmapkkkγ full-length orf and kinase domain could induce rapid cell death. therefore, nbmapkkkγ itself could play an important role in the cell death signaling pathway.

we also explored the functional relationship among these three mapkkk genes by performing an epistasis experiment based on the assumption that if signaling protein a functions upstream of signaling protein b, signaling by activated a will be suppressed by silencing of b expression, whereas signaling by activated b will not be suppressed by silencing of a expression. our results  demonstrate that nbmapkkkα, nbmapkkkβ, and nbmapkkkγ, which represents nbmapkkkγ and/or its homologous gene, form a linear signaling pathway leading to cell death induction in which nbmapkkkβ acts upstream of nbmapkkkγ and nbmapkkkγ acts upstream of nbmapkkkα. results of a similar epistasis analysis have suggested that an npk1/mek1/ntf <dig> mapk cascade functions downstream of a mapkkkα/mek2/sipk mapk cascade in the induction of pcd in plants  <cit> . these results support the possibility that nbmapkkkα, nbmapkkkβ, nbmapkkkγ, and npk <dig> initiate four distinct mapk cascades that are coordinately involved in plant cell death. alternatively, different sets of mapk cascades might be involved in cell death signaling pathways induced by different plant–microbe interactions. to investigate this issue, further research is needed to determine whether nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ participate in the n gene-mediated hr against tmv or in the pto-mediated hr against pst.

in our experiments, the transient overexpression of the nbmapkkkε <dig> kinase domain by agroinfiltration did not induce cell death . however, melech-bonfil and associates have shown that the tomato homolog of nbmapkkkε <dig>  slmapkkkε, is required for pcd induction in the hr against gram-negative bacterial pathogens  <cit> . furthermore, they showed that the transient overexpression of the tomato slmapkkkε kinase domain in n. benthamiana induces pathogen-independent cell death. a comparison between the amino acid sequences of the kinase domains of nbmapkkkε <dig> and slmapkkkε indicated only three amino acid differences. these three residues are not highly conserved and are not predicted to be essential for plant kinase catalytic activity, so explaining this functional difference solely by the amino acid sequence level is difficult. although at first glance, our results seem to contradict theirs, the results cannot be directly compared because three factors in our transient overexpression experiments differed from theirs: promoters, agrobacterium strains, and species origin of the homologous genes. these three factors, which could influence the expression levels of overexpressed proteins, are critical for the execution of cell death elicited by proteins possessing cell death-inducing activity  <cit> . moreover, the amount of overexpressed nbmapkkkε <dig> kinase domain in our experiment was much more than the amounts of nbmapkkkβ kinase domain and its k → m mutant or nbmapkkkγ kinase domain that can induce cell death and was comparable to the amount of the nbmapkkkγ kinase domain k → m mutant. therefore, nbmapkkkε <dig> might be a less potent inducer of cell death than other mapkkks.

our suggestion that several mapk cascades function in a linear signaling pathway in the induction of cell death raises a concern about their roles in plant defense responses. to prevent pathogen invasion, plants commonly employ two types of receptors   <cit>  to sense multiple pamps or effectors derived from biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. when plants perceive pathogens, the transcription of a common set of genes that act against various types of pathogens is activated  <cit> , subsequently producing many defense responses, including cell death and the production of low-molecular-weight signaling compounds such as ethylene and reactive oxygen species . activation of the mapkkkα/mek2/sipk cascade can induce production of ethylene and ros  <cit> . npk <dig>  which initiates another mapk cascade, is activated by the ros produced by the mapk cascade initiated by mapkkkα  <cit> . similarly, the alfalfa mapkkk msomtk <dig> is activated by hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . these results suggest that compounds induced by an upstream-acting mapk cascade function as signaling molecules that activate a downstream-acting mapk cascade. in addition, they suggest that the involvement of several mapk cascades in defense responses enables plants to activate various responses simultaneously or coordinately to combat various types of pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrated that three mapkkks in n. benthamiana form a linear signaling pathway leading to pcd, implying that the involvement of multiple mapk cascades in plant defense responses enables plants to exhibit various reactions simultaneously. further analysis to identify downstream mapkk and mapk genes directly phosphorylated by nbmapkkkβ and nbmapkkkγ should help clarify the regulatory mechanisms of cell death involving these mapkkk genes. furthermore, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the sequential activation of each mapk cascade during plant defense responses, the upstream components or chemical compounds that directly activate these mapkkks must be identified.
