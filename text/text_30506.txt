BACKGROUND
dysfunction of dopamine neurotransmission is considered a central feature of schizophrenia, with antipsychotic drugs  targeting dopamine d <dig>  receptors to alleviate positive psychotic symptoms in about one half of patients. however the therapeutic window of d <dig> receptor blockade  within which most apds achieve optimal clinical utility does not extend to the atypical apd clozapine, despite its superior efficacy in treatment resistant schizophrenia. sub-threshold levels of d <dig> receptor blockade exerted by clozapine argues for a mechanism of action not solely reliant on d <dig> receptor antagonism. in accord with this, we have reported that clozapine signals to the mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal regulated kinase  cascade via g-protein coupled receptor  transactivation of the epidermal growth factor  receptor   <cit> . this was typified by clozapine induced early inhibition and delayed activation of the erk response in prefrontal cortex  and striatum dependent on egfr signaling in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo <cit>  unlike olanzapine or haloperidol. the convergence of the erk cascade with gpcr and growth factor signaling systems upon activation by apds is noteworthy since signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus can regulate cortical neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neurotransmitter release, processes affected in schizophrenia  <cit> . whether these cell signaling effects observed with clozapine extend to the second generation atypical apds aripiprazole and quetiapine has not been tested. this is relevant given that aripiprazole and quetiapine display agonist and antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity and hyperactivity, respectively, share clozapine’s low d <dig> receptor binding profile  and are predicted to stabilize dopaminergic transmission.

aripiprazole differs from other atypical apds in that it acts by partial agonism at d <dig> and serotonin  1a receptors  <cit> . the drug modulates dopaminergic activity in areas where dopamine may be increased  or diminished  in the brains of people with schizophrenia. like other atypical apds, aripiprazole antagonizes 5ht2a receptors and has moderate affinity for histamine and α-adrenergic receptors. quetiapine is a multiple receptor antagonist with low affinity for d <dig> and higher affinity for 5ht2a, 5ht1a, α- <dig> and α- <dig> adrenergic and histamine h <dig> receptors  <cit> . positron emission topography studies indicate that quetiapine rapidly disassociates from the d <dig> receptor producing normal physiological surges of dopamine in the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular tracts of the brain, thus minimizing the risk of extrapyramidal side effects  and elevations in prolactin. for both aripiprazole and quetiapine, however, effects on downstream erk signaling that can regulate transcription factors such as elk <dig> or creb to shape gene expression, protein synthesis and receptor function is less well characterized. in this regard, acute aripiprazole treatment in mice reduced pfc erk phosphorylation levels in one recorded study to date  <cit> . by contrast, single time point experiments in chinese hamster ovary  cells stably transfected with d <dig> short and 5ht1a  <cit>  and d <dig> receptors  <cit>  indicated that aripiprazole stimulated erk phosphorylation via agonist activities at these receptors. moreover, urban et al.  <cit>  reported that aripiprazole exerted only partial activation of the erk pathway in cho cells expressing d <dig> long receptors, whereas in pc <dig> cells aripiprazole promoted neurite outgrowth through activation at 5ht1a rather than d <dig> receptors and by ca2+, inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate receptor and erk signaling  <cit> . given the cell-dependent differences in the intrinsic activity of aripiprazole, a primary mechanism of action attributable to its functional selectivity at the d <dig> receptor and/or combined action at non-dopamine receptor systems rather than simple partial agonism has also been argued  <cit> . quetiapine too induces erk mediated neurite sprouting via gi/o coupled receptors in pc <dig> cells  <cit> , and activated erk <dig> after acute treatment in c <dig> glioma cells thought to be related to the putative antidepressant efficacy of the drug  <cit> . in vivo, quetiapine facilitated oligodendrocyte development and prevented cuprizone induced cognitive impairments via erk in mouse cortex  <cit>  and upregulated erk gene expression in rat cortex and striatum when administered acutely in conjunction with the mood stabilizer valproate  <cit> . whilst cortical and/or striatal erk phosphorylation by aripiprazole and quetiapine integrate multiple signaling pathways to regulate neuronal processes relevant to the symptom domains of schizophrenia, there remains a paucity of data on the effects of these apds on the expression of downstream proteins such as 90 kda ribosomal s <dig> protein kinase  or c-fos, which potentially define their distinct clinical profiles.

p90rsk comprising the isoforms rsk <dig>  rsk <dig> and rsk <dig> are a family of broadly expressed serine/threonine kinases activated by erk. as a regulator of transcription, p90rsk phosphorylates the transcription factor cyclic amp response element binding , which leads to the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators creb binding protein and the induction of immediate-early genes such as c-fos  <cit> . erk <dig> knock-out mice exhibit reduced phosphorylation of rsk <dig> in pfc and striatum, but not in hippocampus or cerebellum indicating erk signaling deficits that are isoform and region-specific  <cit> . however there is limited data on the effects of apds on p90rsk levels, with aripiprazole or quetiapine treatment effects not documented. similarly there is limited data for aripiprazole and quetiapine in relation to c-fos which signals a genomic response to a variety of stimuli including growth factors and neurotransmitters, with regulation via the phosphorylation of transcription factors elk- <dig> and creb by erk and rsk respectively  <cit> . when compared with other d <dig> receptor partial agonists, aripiprazole caused less rotation in nigrostriatal lesioned rats  but clear fos induction in the nucleus accumbens shell, indicative of low intrinsic activity despite functional antagonism, a purported marker of its antipsychotic efficacy  <cit> . for quetiapine, elevated c-fos expression in limbic but not motor related brain regions  <cit>  with a greater increase in fos immunoreactivity in rat nucleus accumbens shell than dorsolateral striatum is in keeping with its atypical index and reduced eps propensity  <cit> . apart from these data, the effects of aripiprazole and quetiapine on p90rsk and c-fos signaling via the erk pathway and the interrelated egfr system and how these may differ from clozapine are yet to be profiled.

from this standpoint and to examine whether erk pathway signaling and transactivation of the egfr is a mechanism that applies to atypical apds other than clozapine, the studies undertaken here expand our earlier in vitro neuronal culture and in vivo animal experiments  <cit>  to  determine whether acute aripiprazole or quetiapine treatment differentially regulates erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation over a  <dig> hr period in mouse pfc or striatum  assess whether changes in erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation parallel changes in expression of the transcriptional regulators p90rsk and c-fos across 24 hrs in pfc or striatum and  establish if variations in erk1/ <dig>  p90rsk or c-fos levels following aripiprazole or quetiapine treatment in cortex or striatum are dependent on egfr signaling. the pfc and striatum are examined given their relevance to apd signaling and innervation by the major dopamine tracts of the brain, the mesocortical and nigrostriatal pathways, respectively, and also by glutamatergic and gamma-amino-butyric acid -ergic neurons  <cit> . both regions are important in the pathology of schizophrenia, since the pfc is linked with cognitive, negative and deficit syndrome symptoms and the striatum with motor control, reward and decision making and the eps triggered by some apds.

effect of aripiprazole and quetiapine over 24 hours on erk phosphorylation in mouse prefrontal cortex and striatum
exposure to aripiprazole resulted in region-specific perk1/ <dig> findings with phosphorylation altered in the pfc  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; perk2: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> )  but not in the striatum  table  <dig>  triphasic cortical erk phosphorylation was noted, with perk1/ <dig> levels decreased at 20 min , increased by 60 min , decreased by 240 min  and normalised thereafter. the significant effects detected for perk <dig> were more apparent than those observed for perk <dig> . by contrast, quetiapine treatment over a  <dig> hr period, did not significantly affect erk <dig> and erk <dig> phosphorylation in mouse pfc  . in striatum, a marked increase in perk <dig> activation was observed only at 240 min  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; vehicle  <dig> ± 4% vs quetiapine  <dig> ± 6%, <dig> p <  <dig> ) with levels normalizing by 24 hr  while perk <dig> levels did not vary significantly between untreated and quetiapine treated mice at any time point .

effect of aripiprazole and quetiapine in the absence and presence of ag <dig> on erk phosphorylation in mouse prefrontal cortex and striatum
for aripiprazole, erk activation of both isoforms was observed in the pfc after 60 min of drug treatment and hence the effect of ag <dig> was examined at this time point. as previously, aripiprazole produced a significant increase in erk <dig> and erk <dig> phosphorylation in mouse pfc at 60 min . however, these effects were not attenuated by ag <dig> . contrary to this, quetiapine modulation of striatal erk <dig> phosphorylation was significantly reduced by pre-treatment with ag <dig> , whereas ag <dig> itself did not significantly change perk <dig> levels relative to vehicle control .

effect of aripiprazole and quetiapine over 24 hours on p90rsk phosphorylation in mouse prefrontal cortex and striatum
aripiprazole significantly altered p90rsk phosphorylation in the pfc overall compared to vehicle treated animals  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) but elevations in p90rsk phosphorylation at 480 min and 24 hr were not significant after post hoc corrections . similarly, aripiprazole administration in mouse striatum produced non-significant changes in p90rsk phosphorylation with decreases at  <dig> and 240 min failing to reach significance . alternatively over a  <dig> hr period, quetiapine treatment significantly affected p90rsk phosphorylation in mouse pfc  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and striatum  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) . this was attributable to a significant decrease in p90rsk phosphorylation at 20 min in the pfc   whilst in the striatum, significant reductions at  <dig> and 60 min  were observed, with levels normalizing thereafter .

given that aripiprazole and quetiapine triggered variable patterns of p90rsk phosphorylation in pfc and striatum but produced no significant increases in either region, the effect of ag <dig> exposure to these apds on p90rsk phosphorylation was not examined.

effect of aripiprazole and quetiapine over 24 hours on c-fos expression in mouse prefrontal cortex and striatum
characterization of c-fos expression in response to aripiprazole in the cortex indicated a significant effect of treatment over the 24 hr period  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) attributed to an increase at 60 min  . fluctuations in c-fos levels in the striatum after aripiprazole treatment also reached significance  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) with elevations seen at 20 min  and 60 min  . following quetiapine administration, a marked increase in c-fos protein was observed at 240 min in pfc  and striatum  with levels comparable to vehicle treatment at other times across 24 hr .

effect of aripiprazole and quetiapine in the absence and presence of ag <dig> on c-fos expression in mouse prefrontal cortex and striatum
the increased c-fos levels caused by aripiprazole at 60 min in pfc and striatum were not significantly affected by prior administration of ag <dig> in either region . similarly for quetiapine, elevations in c-fos expression observed at 240 min in cortex and striatum were not significantly reduced by ag <dig> .

discussion
aripiprazole and quetiapine differentially regulate erk phosphorylation
the mechanisms underlying the action of aripiprazole and quetiapine on the erk transduction pathway in pfc and striatum in vivo are largely unknown. we therefore determined that aripiprazole triggered triphasic erk phosphorylation with perk <dig> and perk <dig> levels first decreased in mouse pfc at 20 min, increased by 60 min, decreased by 4 hrs and normalised thereafter. no striatal perk changes were noted with aripiprazole treatment. by contrast quetiapine caused no significant changes in erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in cortex, while in striatum perk <dig> activation was only observed at 240 min. moreover, cortical erk induction by aripiprazole was independent of egfr activity whereas striatal erk induction by quetiapine was egfr dependent. the observed differences in perk1/ <dig> levels were not due to corresponding variation in total erk1/ <dig> pools since these remained relatively stable across experiments. rather, significant variability between perk isoform levels within brain regions at the times tested may suggest that perk1/ <dig> pools are functionally discrete. therefore erk signaling was affected differently by aripiprazole and quetiapine in a time-dependent and region-specific manner and was reliant on egfr transactivation in the case of quetiapine.

the erk profile induced by aripiprazole may be a consequence of the drug’s novel receptor binding properties that primarily modulate and stabilize the dopamine system  <cit> . the efficacy of aripiprazole is proposed to be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at d <dig> and 5ht1a receptors and antagonist activity at 5ht2a receptors  <cit> . although the functional significance of the cortical perk1/ <dig> fluctuations observed following aripiprazole administration is not known, they are noteworthy in light of aripiprazole’s clinical effects. for example, the relatively low risk of eps associated with aripiprazole use  <cit>  is presumed to be due to the drug’s lack of effect on the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain. the latter is in line with our own in vivo data indicating an absence of significant changes in striatal perk1/ <dig> levels after aripiprazole treatment over the time course studied. our cortical finding of early reduction in erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation at 20 min also concurs with a single in vivo study that recorded a decrease in perk1/ <dig> levels 15 min after acute aripiprazole administration, although subsequent time points were not examined  <cit> . drawing valid comparisons between in vitro experiments utilizing d <dig>  d <dig> and 5ht1a receptor-transfected cho and pc <dig> cells exposed to aripiprazole for  <dig> and 10 min  <cit>  and our own in vivo work is however difficult given the inherent differences in the biological systems and time frames investigated.

the lack of effect of in vivo treatment with quetiapine in cortex contrasts with the erk phosphorylation profile induced by clozapine  <cit> , even though both atypical apds are d <dig>  5ht2a and α- <dig> adrenergic receptor antagonists. differences in factors such as proportional drug receptor occupancy and affinity state may account for the distinctive erk signaling response of each apd  <cit> . for quetiapine, a dose of 5 mg/kg was chosen to limit the sedative properties of the drug that are presumed to occur via histamine h <dig> receptor antagonist activity  <cit> . therefore sedation is unlikely to be the reason for the absence of cortical perk1/ <dig> effects observed. in striatum, quetiapine increased perk <dig> activation only at 240 min, unlike the sustained erk <dig> phosphorylation previously seen with haloperidol  <cit> . this is interesting given that quetiapine use is associated with risk of tardive dyskinesia  <cit>  but to a less extent than typical apds  <cit> . this reduced risk of motor side-effects is thought to be due to quetiapine’s rapid dissociation from d <dig> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain  <cit> . however inferences on the clinical effects of quetiapine attributable to erk activation are limited since they can only be drawn from a few in vitro cell studies  <cit> , a chronic in vivo mouse study  <cit>  and an acute rat gene expression study  <cit> . in this regard, quetiapine promoted erk mediated neurite sprouting in pc <dig> cells  <cit>  with improvements in affect and mood also ascribed to erk signaling  <cit> , and in mouse cortex prevented cuprizone induced myelin breakdown and cognitive impairments via erk dependent on egf  <cit> . our data support the latter study insofar as we show an interaction between quetiapine and the egfr in mediating erk activation in the striatum.

aripiprazole and quetiapine effects on the downstream erk targets p90rsk and c-fos
aripiprazole and quetiapine induced p90rsk phosphorylation did not parallel that of erk unlike for clozapine  <cit> . overall we found that quetiapine decreased p90rsk levels within 1 hr of administration regardless of its concomitant effect on erk, while aripiprazole did not appreciably affect p90rsk phosphorylation. these data therefore suggest that in pfc and striatum p90rsk is unlikely a major downstream target of erk signaling in response to aripiprazole or quetiapine and that these drugs differ from clozapine in the way in which they influence distal transcriptional measures  <cit> . in terms of c-fos expression however, significant induction at 60 min by aripiprazole and at 240 min by quetiapine corresponded with increased erk phosphorylation at the same time points in pfc and striatum, respectively. the absence of a time delay between erk activation and stimulation of c-fos by aripiprazole and quetiapine again contrasts with our clozapine findings in which c-fos was expressed subsequent to increases in erk phosphorylation  <cit> . for both drugs, elevations in c-fos were not affected by egfr inhibition. thus given that quetiapine induced c-fos activation in striatum was not affected by ag <dig> but erk phosphorylation was significantly reduced suggests that using a pharmacological agent to block the egf receptor, an upstream component of the pathway, may inadequately affect a downstream nuclear response. alternatively, c-fos activation may have occurred independently of egfr-erk pathway induction via other signaling mechanisms or extracellular mitogenic stimuli upon in vivo exposure to quetiapine.

for aripiprazole, while c-fos protein induction in the pfc has not been previously documented, early 20 min striatal  up-regulation observed concurs with high fos expression in the nucleus accumbens shell  versus lower levels in the dorsolateral striatum seen 2 hr after acute administration in rat and recognized as markers of antipsychotic efficacy and motor side effects, respectively  <cit> . similarly for quetiapine, increased c-fos expression in pfc and striatum at 240 min is in general accordance with acute  <cit>  and chronic  <cit>  data in rat, where fos-like immunoreactivity was elevated in pfc and ventral striatum although the temporal link to erk signaling in striatum has not been reported before. while it is understood that apds do not reach complete effectiveness after a single dose, the present findings are of mechanistic value and allow future studies to be designed to examine whether there is any difference in signaling induced by sustained treatment with these agents. moreover, the current studies utilizing mouse neuronal tissue to examine the signaling and hence phosphorylation status of proteins relevant to apd action cannot be undertaken in human subjects . therefore the animal experiments described permit some delineation of the specific intracellular pathways targeted by apds. in doing so, these studies may point to potential candidate proteins and mechanisms affected by apds and may shed light on psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.

antipsychotic drugs and the egf receptor system
we had earlier proposed that clozapine may be unique in recruiting the egfr system to target erk and that this may have some bearing on clozapine’s unequaled ability to treat drug resistant schizophrenia  <cit> . here in keeping with our hypothesis erk induction by aripiprazole was egfr independent but contrary to our supposition, quetiapine induced erk activation was egfr dependent. there are however important differences between quetiapine and clozapine signaling including: i) regional differences in erk expression. quetiapine activated erk in striatum only and had no effect in the pfc whereas clozapine was able to induce erk in mouse pfc and striatum. ii) temporal differences in erk expression. quetiapine affected striatal erk phosphorylation at 240 min but not at other time points across the treatment schedule. by contrast, clozapine inhibited erk phosphorylation within 1 hr of administration, and then activated erk at 480 min in both brain regions. therefore, while quetiapine and clozapine share the ability to recruit the egfr to signal to erk, they nevertheless control erk phosphorylation differently. notably, quetiapine is not effective in treatment resistant schizophrenia unlike clozapine. whether differences in erk expression provide additional benefits for clozapine-treated patients that may account for the drug’s greater efficacy over other apd remains to be addressed.

the regulation of the egfr by quetiapine and clozapine is a novel mechanism of apd action with potential implications for the treatment of schizophrenia. besides playing a central role in the development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, impaired egf system functioning has been linked to the pathogenesis of the disorder. for example, genetic association studies have identified the egf and nrg <dig> genes as candidates that confer risk for schizophrenia  <cit>  with an a61g single nucleotide polymorphism in the egf gene associated with early disease onset in male patients  <cit> . as well in human post-mortem brain in schizophrenia, increased egfr density was considered to offset the low egf levels noted  <cit> . furthermore while perturbation to neonatal egf signaling resulted in behavioural brain abnormalities in adulthood consistent with those present in animal models of schizophrenia  <cit> , the egf family of ligands and receptors also affect neuronal growth, differentiation and survival later in development  <cit> . thus given that several studies argue for egf system disturbance in schizophrenia, the current findings indicate a possible corrective role for apds such as quetiapine.

just which gpcr is employed by quetiapine or clozapine to undertake egfr transactivation is unclear. both apds share the property of being d2/5ht2a antagonists. while we have demonstrated in primary mouse cortical neurons that clozapine induced transactivation of the egfr occurred independently of the d <dig> or 5ht2a receptor  <cit> , whether this holds true for quetiapine is unclear. the transactivation pathway that signals to the egfr also needs to be elucidated for quetiapine and clozapine, bearing in mind that there may be regional differences.

CONCLUSIONS
these in vivo studies highlight that the atypical apds aripiprazole and quetiapine exert unique temporal and regional regulation of the convergent egfr-erk pathway and its downstream transcriptional targets, p90rsk and c-fos in pfc and striatum that may account for their distinctive clinical profiles. in this regard, cortical perk <dig> stimulation by aripiprazole was egfr independent whereas striatal perk <dig> activation by quetiapine was egfr dependent. while aripiprazole induction of erk had no significant specific effect on p90rsk signaling, quetiapine reduced rsk phosphorylation early after exposure. by contrast, c-fos expression induced by aripiprazole in cortex and quetiapine in striatum temporally aligned with erk phosphorylation and was indicative of transcriptional regulation as a direct corollary of apd induced erk signaling. collectively, these data provide further evidence that apd action via erk may be linked to the egf signaling system, perturbations of which have been documented in schizophrenia and suggest a remedial role for apds such as quetiapine.
