BACKGROUND
the cyclic amp -dependent protein kinase  regulatory network  is found in protozoa, animals, algae, and fungi. it plays a central role in the control of different inter- and intra- cellular processes such as metabolism, cell proliferation, stress response, and development  <cit> . in yeast, the pka-rn is also involved in the control of growth in response to nutrient conditions, which in turn are known to influence the stress response  <cit> .

in s. cerevisiae, the pka holoenzyme forms an inactive tetramer composed of two regulatory subunits   <cit>  and two out of three cs   <cit> . when intracellular concentrations of camp increase, bcy <dig> binds camp, promoting the activation by release of the cs. two proteins, gpa <dig> and ras <dig>  regulate adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of camp  <cit> . formation of a ras2⋅gtp complex  <cit> , the active state of ras <dig>  requires the gdp-gtp exchange activity of cdc <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the intracellular concentrations of camp are also controlled by the phosphodiesterases pde <dig> and pde <dig>  <cit> . the low affinity phosphodiesterase pde <dig> reduces camp levels in nutrient depleted cells soon after glucose addition  <cit> , whereas the high affinity phosphodiesterase pde <dig> lowers camp levels during the exponential and stationary phases of growth  <cit> . it is thought that the activity of the pathway increases at high levels of glucose  and declines when the cells deplete the sugars, or when entering stationary phase  <cit> . therefore, the pka activity is influenced by the amount of fermentable sugars and by the growth phase of the culture.

the growth phase of yeast liquid cultures impacts their level of thermotolerance. for instance, during the exponential phase cells are stress sensitive, whereas during the stationary phase they develop stress resistance  <cit> . this behavior has been studied using genetic analysis. stress resistance is explained through a reduced activity of the ras-camp branch of the pathway . these mutants grow slowly and show elevated basal thermotolerance during exponential phase  <cit> . in contrast, mutants with high pka activity, such as ira <dig>  pde <dig>  bcy <dig> or ras2val <dig>  are very sensitive to temperature stress  <cit> . in exponential phase, basal thermotolerance is negatively regulated by the rim <dig> protein kinase  <cit> . however, acclimation to high temperatures during the exponential phase requires the concerted action of hsf <dig> and msn2/msn <dig> transcription factors, and chromatin remodeling complexes such as swi/snf  <cit> . these factors allow the rapid transcription of genes encoding stress proteins involved in prevention and repair of damages caused by stress  <cit> .

hsf <dig> transcription factor is encoded by a single gene  <cit>  and shows high affinity for the heat shock elements , found in the promoters of the heat shock genes  <cit> . the essentiality of hsf <dig> indicates that — besides being important for the response to carbon starvation as well as heat, osmotic, and oxidative stress — it also plays important functions in normal growth  <cit> . the widespread functions regulated by hsf <dig> explain its binding to a large number of promoters . among the functions of its targets are: protein folding, degradation, trafficking, cell integrity maintenance, transport, signaling, and transcription  <cit> . hsf <dig> contains dna binding and trimerization domains and is hyper-phosphorylated in serine and threonine residues in response to heat and oxidative stress  <cit> , modifications that activate its transcriptional activity  <cit> . the pka constitutively represses the activity of hsf <dig>  thereby inhibiting the expression of small heat shock protein genes  <cit> . it is documented that, in this regulation, the cs of pka do not interact directly with hsf <dig>  <cit> . moreover, when the activity of the pka is low, such as during glucose starvation, hsf <dig> is phosphorylated and activated by yak <dig> and rim <dig> kinases  <cit> . however, the factors that mediate the regulation of hsf <dig> by the pka in glucose-rich media, and in response to heat shock, are still unknown. in addition to hsf <dig>  skn <dig> also recognizes hse elements  <cit>  and is part of a two-component system required for the signaling of the hypo-osmotic stress and the oxidative stress pathways  <cit> . previous reports have shown that the activity of skn <dig> during the oxidative stress response is negatively-regulated by the pka-rn  <cit> .

recently, it has become evident that results based only in experimental approaches, and the static models derived from them, are not sufficient to fully understand the complex dynamics of a cellular system. rather, the integration of experimental data with dynamical modeling has expanded our current knowledge of the cell by enabling the prediction of hidden cellular behaviors. thus, computational modeling is becoming an indispensable tool to comprehend the organization of biological systems  <cit>  and the analysis of the dynamics of the pka-rn is no exception. some studies of the pka-rn considered only its core components and focused on the feed-back regulation of camp levels that nutrient-depleted cells display during the short-term response  to a pulse of glucose  <cit> . more recently, pka-rn models simulate long-term growth  in glucose  <cit>  and evaluate targets downstream of the pka  <cit> . however, in all these models the activity of the three cs  is considered as a single entity, assumption that might be correct in certain scenarios. nonetheless, in most situations, this assumption could be misleading, as it is known that each cs has unique target specificities  <cit> . furthermore, the cs regulate certain physiological processes in an antagonistic fashion  <cit> , complicating even more the prediction of the dynamics of the pka-rn.

in this work, we performed a genetic analysis of the cdc25-ras <dig> branch and some downstream components of the pka-rn . we then incorporated these results into a dynamic computational model, to further understand the mechanistic nature of the network. hse-dependent gene expression was chosen as the end product of the pka-rn and the performance of cells growing exponentially in glucose-rich media, both at optimal temperature and in response to heat shock, was evaluated. we tested how the different pka subunits  interacted with each other. novel interactions, in addition to those already known, are described. computational modeling of the pka-rn was performed by extending the well-established “discrete dynamics modeling framework”  <cit>  in order to take into account the fact that gene expression measurements of batch cultures average out individual expression patterns. we named this extension, the windowed discrete model  because it averages over a given time window the discrete values of the network elements in a given attractor, and weighs this average by the size of the corresponding basin of attraction. this process incorporates the whole set of steady states of the network and captures the inherent averages in population measurements. although discrete dynamic models are intended to describe expression patterns at the single-cell level, our approach allowed us to make quantitative predictions of gene expression patterns taken at the population level for both wt and mutant strains. furthermore, we showed that when the population average inherent to batch cultures was implemented in the wdm, the results were similar regardless of the use of synchronous or asynchronous updating of the network elements.fig.  <dig> scheme for the development of a dynamic computational model for the simulation of the regulation of hse-dependent gene expression by the pka-rn. a pka-rn composed of  <dig> elements was simulated in a dynamic computational model . in this scheme cdc <dig>  ras <dig>  cyr <dig>  tpk <dig>  tpk <dig>  hsf <dig>  and skn <dig> act as positive regulators. bcy <dig>  an unidentified repressor of hsf1/skn <dig> , camp, and heat shock act as repressors. interestingly, in this scheme ssa <dig>  ssa <dig>  and tpk <dig> interactions are complex acting both as activators and as repressors. the experimental evidence that accounts for the activities and interactions of the components is described in the background and results and discussion sections



our genetic analysis showed that the pka-rn controls hse-dependent gene expression via hsf1/skn <dig> transcription factors. modeling the control of hsf1-skn <dig> by the pka-rn predicted the existence of a repressor connecting the cs with hsf1-skn <dig> and encouraged new genetic analyses that proved that ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> chaperones repress hsf1/skn <dig> when activated by the cs of pka. additionally, novel functions of skn <dig> and of the c-terminal domain of hsf <dig>  such as growth control, thermotolerance, and resistance to h2o <dig>  were revealed whenever the activity of pka was low. our model also predicted the existence of a still unidentified third repressor of hsf1/skn <dig>  active only in the absence of tpk <dig>  the wdm explained and predicted hse-dependent gene expression in wt and mutant strains with and without high temperature stress. we believe that our wdm of the pka-rn can be useful to simulate other biological processes where the cs of pka show similar antagonistic interactions, such as in the control of pseudohyphal growth or iron uptake  <cit> .

without further adaptations, the wdm is, to our knowledge, the first suitable tool based on discrete dynamics that can be used to simulate data obtained from population level measurements , despite of their known heterogeneity at the physiological and gene expression levels  <cit> .

RESULTS
analysis of gene expression and dynamical modeling of the pka-rn was performed during exponential growth. measurements were taken under optimal temperature and after a heat shock at 39 °c . the regulation of stress gene expression depends on complex transcriptional mechanisms. for example, in s. cerevisiae msn <dig>  msn <dig>  hsf <dig>  yap <dig>  and eight additional transcription factors contribute to the transcription of heat shock genes  <cit> . the pka-rn also controls stress gene expression by inhibiting the activity of msn <dig>  msn <dig>  hsf <dig>  yap <dig>  and skn <dig>  <cit> . because of this complexity, we decided to focus on the transcription factors hsf <dig> and skn <dig> in wt and pka-rn deletion mutants by measuring the activity of an hse-cyc1-lacz reporter gene construct to test their in vivo activity , as reported before  <cit> . in our hands, this reporter showed no activity in the absence of the hse and its activity did not correlate with the plasmid copy number in the different strains analyzed . because the effect on hse-dependent expression by deletions in pka-rn genes is dependent on the genetic background , all mutants used in this work were derivatives of the same laboratory strain . previous studies have shown that in w <dig>  the expression of several stress genes such as hsp <dig>  tps <dig>  ctt <dig>  gpd <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> are inhibited by pka  <cit>  and, in the case of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  their inhibition by pka is mediated through hsf <dig>  <cit> .

cdc <dig> positively regulates hse-dependent gene expression
cdc <dig> deletion caused strong alterations in two well-known pka-regulated processes: growth rate  and basal thermotolerance  . hse-driven β-galactosidase activity at 25 °c was  <dig> -fold higher in cdc25Δ cells than in the wt strain . after heat shock, the wt strain increased the reporter activity  <dig> -fold relative to the 25 °c condition. in cdc25Δ cells, β-galactosidase activity remained unchanged at both temperatures; noteworthy these levels were significantly higher than in the wt at 39 °c. these results indicate that cdc <dig> down-regulates hse-dependent gene expression in wt cells and they are consistent with previous findings showing that pka inhibits hsf <dig> activity  <cit> .fig.  <dig> de-repression of hse-dependent gene expression in cdc25Δ cells is dependent on both hsf <dig> and skn <dig> activities. strains transformed with reporter plasmid pry <dig>  were grown in sd medium at 25 °c until mid-exponential phase and treated at different temperatures as described in methods section. values are reported as β-galactosidase specific activity  and are the average and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. bars that do not share at least a common letter differ significantly . strains assayed were: a wt , hsf1-Δcta , cdc25Δ , and hsf1-Δcta cdc25Δ . b wt , skn7Δ , cdc25Δ , and cdc25Δ skn7Δ 



hsf <dig> and skn <dig> mediate the high basal thermotolerance and constitutive hse-dependent gene expression in cdc25Δ cells
both hsf <dig> and skn <dig> transcription factors recognize hses  <cit> . therefore, we separately evaluated their contributions to the constitutively-elevated hse-dependent expression in cdc25Δ cells. an hsf <dig> lacking  <dig> residues at the c-terminal domain  was used instead of a full deletion of the orf, because the function of hsf <dig> is essential  <cit> . at 25 °c the β-galactosidase activity in the hsf1-Δcta strain equated that of the wt but, unlike the wt, after a heat shock at 39 °c its β-galactosidase activity did not increase . this confirms that the c-terminal activation domain is required to elevate hsf <dig> transcriptional activity in response to heat shock  <cit> . furthermore, β-galactosidase levels in the double mutant hsf1-Δcta cdc25Δ decreased significantly compared to the single cdc25Δ mutant, both at 25 °c and after heat shock, supporting the idea that cdc <dig> regulates hsf <dig> . accordingly, the basal thermotolerance  of hsf1-Δcta cdc25Δ cells decreased relative to the cdc25Δ single mutant  . although basal thermotolerance of hsf1-Δcta mutant was similar to the wt strain, its duplication time at 25 °c increased slightly . we also found that deletion of the c-terminal domain of hsf <dig> suppressed the lack of growth of cdc25Δ cells in acetate or galactose at 25 °c. we suggest that the c-terminal domain of hsf <dig> plays a negative role in the control of growth in non-fermentable media under conditions of low pka activity. in yeast, humans and in arabidopsis, hsp <dig> interacts with the c-terminal activation domain of hsf <dig> inhibiting its transcriptional activity  <cit> . we predict that the transcriptional activity and the growth-promoting potential of the full-length hsf <dig>  when the cell is under under low pka conditions, could be re-established by deletion of genes encoding hsp <dig> 

in wt cells, hse-dependent expression increased at the beginning of the post-diauxic phase . this observation agrees with the decline of pka activity at this stage  <cit> . a similar pattern was observed in cdc25Δ cells, although their initial activity was already very high. interestingly, the β-galactosidase activity in the double mutant hsf1-Δcta cdc25Δ was smaller than the activity in cdc25Δ cells, remaining constant during the exponential and postdiauxic phases. this indicates that the cta domain of hsf <dig> is required for maximal activity in low pka cells. unexpectedly, β-galactosidase levels in the hsf1-Δcta strain declined steadily as the culture advanced from exponential to the post-diauxic phase . these observations reinforce the idea that hsf <dig> activity is essential to enter the post-diauxic phase at optimal temperatures. thus, the c-terminal domain of hsf <dig> plays four novel functional roles at 25 °c when pka activity is low: i) increases basal thermotolerance , ii) increases hse-dependent gene expression , iii) causes growth arrest in acetate, iv) causes growth arrest in galactose. these functions of the c-terminal domain of hsf <dig> were not previously described  <cit> .fig.  <dig> increase of hse-dependent gene expression, during the post-diauxic phase of liquid cultures at 25 °c, requires hsf <dig> activity. strains containing plasmid pry <dig> were grown in sd medium at 25 °c and aliquots were taken at the indicated culture densities . data shown represent the average and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. β-galactosidase specific activities are reported as in fig.  <dig>  bars that do not share at least a common letter differ significantly . strains assayed were: wt , hsf1-Δcta , hsf1-Δcta cdc25Δ , and cdc25Δ 



to analyze the contribution of skn <dig>  the double mutant skn7Δ cdc25Δ was also transformed with reporter plasmid pry <dig>  the β-galactosidase activity in skn7Δ cdc25Δ cells at 25 °c or after heat shock was lower than that of cdc25Δ cells . in contrast to cdc25Δ hsf1-Δcta cells, β-galactosidase activity increased upon heat shock at 39 °c. however, this increase was not statistically significant . this indicates that, in the cdc25Δ strain, hse-dependent expression is reliant on skn <dig> for optimal temperature growth to a greater extent than after a heat shock. furthermore, the basal thermotolerance and the duplication time of cdc25Δ skn7Δ cells decreased relative to cdc25Δ cells , while the inhibition of growth at 36 °c and in acetate or galactose as sole carbon sources at 25 °c were suppressed by skn <dig> deletion. in agreement with the involvement of skn <dig> in the oxidative stress response  <cit> , we observed that resistance of cdc25Δ cells to h2o <dig> decreased by deletion of skn <dig> . the activity of the reporter gene in the single skn7Δ mutant was similar to the wt at 25 °c and after a heat shock at 39 °c . together, these results indicate that, in cells growing at optimal temperature or when their pka activity is low, skn <dig> is required to achieve maximal basal thermotolerance and hse-dependent gene expression. the contribution of skn <dig> to the elevated hse-dependent gene expression in response to heat shock was only marginal . thus, heat induction of hse-dependent gene expression in cells with low or high pka activity depends mostly on hsf <dig>  however, we found that skn <dig> plays new roles in other cellular processes at low pka activity: i) inhibits growth at 25 °c, ii) it is required for h2o <dig> resistance, iii) causes growth arrest in glucose at 36 °c, iv) causes growth arrest in acetate at 25 °c, v) causes growth arrest in galactose at 25 °c.

ras <dig> also regulates hse-dependent gene expression
ras <dig> is a positive regulator of the pka-rn acting downstream of cdc <dig>  in a ras <dig> deletion mutant, basal thermotolerance was 120-fold higher than in the wt strain  . this difference was consistent with a constitutively elevated hse-dependent gene expression at 25 °c . growth rate of the ras <dig> mutant was similar to the wt strain . the increased thermotolerance of cdc <dig> and ras <dig> single mutants  confirmed that their pka activity decreased. however, the growth rate diminished only in the cdc <dig>  but not in the ras <dig> mutant. this finding indicates that the control of basal thermotolerance is more sensitive to a low pka cellular activity than duplication time is.fig.  <dig> effect of ras <dig>  and bcy <dig> deletions on hse-dependent gene expression. strains were transformed with plasmid pry <dig>  containing an hse-cyc1-lacz reporter gene. growth and temperature treatments were performed as described in methods section. data shown represent the average and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. β-galactosidase specific activities are reported as in fig.  <dig>  bars that do not share at least a common letter differ significantly . strains assayed were: wt , ras2Δ  and bcy1Δ 



deletion of bcy <dig> represses the hse-dependent gene expression
to evaluate whether cells with high pka activity altered hse-dependent gene expression in the opposite way to mutants with low pka activity, such as cdc25Δ and ras2Δ, a deletion mutant of bcy <dig> was studied. indeed, hse-dependent expression was repressed in bcy1Δ cells relative to the wt strain at 25 °c and after heat shock at 39 °c . consistent with these results, duplication time decreased in the bcy1Δ mutant, while basal thermotolerance remained the same as in the wt strain . induced thermotolerance decreased dramatically in bcy1Δ cells . moreover, cell viability in bcy1Δ cells was very poor, in agreement with previous results  <cit> .

tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> inhibit hse-dependent gene expression in the absence of tpk2
to explore the possible differences between the cs of pka, we first analyzed hse-dependent expression in single tpk gene deletion mutants. in tpk1Δ cells hse-dependent expression was slightly reduced at 39 °c but not at 25 °c when compared to the wt . in tpk3Δ cells hse-dependent expression was not affected. interestingly, hse-dependent expression in the tpk2Δ mutant was highly repressed both at 25 °c and 39 °c. the basal thermotolerance of the three single mutants was similar to the wt strain . duplication times of tpk2Δ or tpk3Δ mutants were similar to the wt strain. however, the tpk1Δ mutant showed a slower growth rate . induced thermotolerance was reduced relative to wt in tpk1Δ and tpk2Δ mutants, but not in tpk3Δ. these results suggested that each cs plays a different role in the control of hse-dependent gene expression, growth, and in basal- and induced-thermotolerance. in order to analyze the role of individual tpk’s, double tpk deletion mutants were studied. the β-galactosidase activities of tpk1Δ tpk3Δ cells growing at 25 °c or after heat shock at 39 °c were similar to their isogenic wt strain . however, its basal thermotolerance and duplication time increased relative to the wt strain . in contrast, the β-galactosidase activities at  <dig> and 39 °c in cells containing only tpk <dig>  or tpk <dig>  were very low , whereas their basal thermotolerance and duplication time were similar to the wt. however, the level of induced thermotolerance of tpk1Δ tpk2Δ was lower  than in wt cells . in tpk2Δ tpk3Δ and tpk1Δ tpk3Δ cells, the induced thermotolerance levels were similar to the wt cells, supporting the idea that tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> hyper-repress the hse-dependent gene expression when acting as the sole pka cs, and that tpk <dig> represses the induced thermotolerance if acting as sole pka cs. these results confirm the hypothesis that the activities of the cs are not redundant for the control of hse-dependent gene expression, growth, basal or induced thermotolerance. also, these findings imply that tpk <dig> activity antagonizes tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> action, as has been suggested by other studies on the control of iron uptake and pseudohyphal growth  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effect of tpk gene deletions on hse-dependent gene expression. strains were transformed with plasmid pry <dig>  containing an hse-cyc1-lacz reporter gene. growth and temperature treatments were performed as described in methods section. values are reported as β-galactosidase specific activity  and are the average and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. bars that do not share at least a common letter differ significantly . strains assayed were: wt , tpk1Δ , tpk2Δ , tpk3Δ , tpk2Δ tpk3Δ , tpk1Δ tpk3Δ , tpk1Δ tpk2Δ , tpk2Δ:: tpk <dig> tpk3Δ 



heat shock gene transcript levels are reduced when tpk <dig> is the only cs
to learn more about the strong repressing activity of tpk <dig> upon hsf <dig>  when tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> are absent, we studied the levels of several stress genes within the context of their natural promoters. as shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  expression of the heat shock genes hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  ssa <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> at 25 °c was reduced in the tpk1Δ tpk2Δ mutant relative to the wt strain. this result is consistent with the low level of induced thermotolerance displayed by the tpk1Δ tpk2Δ mutant . transformation of tpk1Δ tpk2Δ cells with tpk <dig> in a cen plasmid did not complement fully the hse-dependent gene expression at wt levels , most likely because tpk <dig> gene copy number per cell was not  <dig>  but  <dig>  copies/cell. transformation of the tpk1Δ tpk2Δ cells with tpk <dig> in a 2 μ plasmid was toxic to the cell, explaining the surprisingly low copy number in the surviving cells .

tpk <dig> antagonizes the activity of tpk1
to further test the hypothesis that the loss of tpk <dig> in the tpk2Δ tpk3Δ double mutant causes repression of hse-dependent gene expression, the tpk <dig> gene was returned to the tpk2Δ tpk3Δ double mutant using the delitto perfetto technique   <cit> , restoring the native copy number of the gene. this modification  returned hse-dependent expression to wt levels , supporting the idea that tpk <dig> antagonizes the activity of tpk <dig> on hse-dependent expression.

catalytic activity of pka in extracts from tpk mutants
we hypothesized that antagonism between tpk <dig> and the other cs  was due to drastic changes in the total pka activity of the cell. accordingly, we could expect that the total pka activity in tpk <dig> mutants  would be high, whereas in the wt, tpk1Δ, tpk3Δ, and tpk1Δ tpk3Δ mutants the pka activity would be low. after addition of camp, pka activity in extracts from mutants tpk1Δ, tpk3Δ, and tpk1Δ tpk3Δ was similar to the wt . on the contrary, camp-dependent pka activity decreased in tpk2Δ, tpk1Δ tpk2Δ, and tpk3Δ mutants. these results indicate that hse-dependent expression is not a simple reflection of the overall pka activity within the cell. alternatively, one could also propose that deletion of a given tpk gene reduced the pka activity in the cell in a proportional manner to its abundance in the wt. it is established that during exponential growth in liquid cultures yeasts contain a large proportion of tpk <dig>  followed by tpk <dig>  and tpk <dig> being the one with the lowest abundance  <cit> . thus, elimination of tpk <dig> and/or tpk <dig> should diminish dramatically the pka activity in the cell. this was the case for tpk <dig> deletions but not for tpk <dig> deletions , indicating again that deletion of a given tpk gene does not influence arithmetically the overall pka activity in the cell. therefore, dynamic mechanisms seem to define the final pka activity in the wt and in a given tpk mutant .

ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> mediate the inhibition of hse-dependent gene expression
our initial computational model assumed that the regulation of hsf1/skn <dig> by the cs was direct. however, under this design, predicted and experimental hse-activities for several pka-rn mutants gave contrasting results. complete agreement between experimental and computational data was not achieved until a negative regulator was placed as an intermediary between the cs and hsf1/skn <dig> . this idea was in accordance with previous findings demonstrating that the cs's do not interact directly with hsf <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we considered hsp <dig> chaperones as putative intermediate inhibitors, because they are well-known negative regulators of hsf <dig>  yeast mutants with decreased hsp <dig> levels increase the expression of hsps, enhance thermotolerance, and grow slowly. additionally, these phenotypes are suppressed by a mutation in hsf <dig> that decreases its dna binding affinity  <cit> . these observations and others from both mammals and yeast reinforce a model that includes an auto-regulatory loop in which hsp <dig> represses hsf <dig> activity  <cit> . moreover, ssa <dig> positively controls the pka-rn by stabilizing cdc <dig> at optimal temperatures  <cit>  and, under stress, the cdc25-hsp <dig> complex dissociates leading to a loss of cdc <dig> levels and a decrease in the activity of the pka pathway  <cit> . our experiments revealed that deletion of ssa <dig> increased hse-dependent gene expression . deletion of ssa <dig> did not affect hse-dependent gene expression significantly, indicating that ssa <dig> suffices for maintaining wt activity. deletion of both ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> largely increased the reporter activity, uncovering the contribution of both hsp <dig> genes as repressors of hse-dependent gene expression in wt cells. interestingly, deletion of ssa <dig> or ssa <dig> in a tpk2Δ background did not suppress the strong repression of hse-dependent gene expression characteristic of the tpk2Δ single mutant . however, the phenotype of the tpk2Δ mutant was suppressed in the triple mutant ssa1Δ ssa2Δ tpk2Δ, as its hse-dependent expression was higher than in tpk2Δ cells , similar to that of the ssa1Δ and the wt at 25 °c, and lower compared to ssa1Δ and the wt at 39 °c. these results implicated ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> not only as mediators of the strong repression of hse-dependent gene expression, but also suggest the existence of an additional repressor of hsf1/skn <dig>  active in the absence of tpk <dig> fig.  <dig> a role for ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> in the repression of hse-dependent gene expression. strains transformed with reporter plasmid pry <dig> were grown in sd medium at 25 °c until mid-exponential phase and treated at different temperatures as described in methods section. data shown represent the average and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. β-galactosidase specific activities are reported as in fig.  <dig>  bars that do not share at least a common letter differ significantly . strains assayed were: wt , tpk2Δ , ssa1Δ , ssa1Δ tpk2Δ , ssa2Δ , ssa2Δ tpk2Δ , ssa1Δ ssa2Δ , ssa1Δ ssa2Δ tpk2Δ 



the dynamical model of the pka-rn revealed an additional negative regulator of hsf1
to thoroughly understand the implications of our observations we constructed a discrete dynamical model of the pka-rn based both on our results and in the literature  <cit> . as described in the methods section, we have used an extension of a synchronous discrete modeling framework, as this type of modeling is known to accurately predict the behavior of several biological networks. one of the advantages of the discrete framework is that it only requires knowledge about the regulatory nature of the interactions involved, contrary to reaction-kinetic differential equations that require the precise values for all the kinetic parameters and cooperativity exponents of the network elements. for a detailed review of the advantages and disadvantages of discrete and boolean models compared to other frameworks consult  <cit> .

briefly, our model consists on n elements {σ <dig>  σ <dig> …, σn} whose dynamical states take integer values ranging from  <dig> to mi, where mi is the maximum level of activity  for element σi. usually only two levels of activity are implemented: either the node is active  or it is inactive . however, often the functionality of a given node depends on whether it has a low, mild or high level of activity  <cit>  and the binary description is not enough. this is the case here, as our experiments indicate that some nodes of the tpk-rn require distinction of up to six levels of activity . additionally, as currently there is no information about the time scales implicated in the dynamics of the pka-rn elements, for graphing we used a synchronous updating scheme .

for each network  we sampled about 10 % of the complete set of initial conditions  looking for steady states of expression  . as several initial conditions may fall into the same attractor, we define the size of the basin of attraction bk as the number of initial conditions that fall into attractor k. our extension of this traditional modeling framework consists in two simple modifications. first we averaged the level of expression for each element over a time window whose length equaled the attractor period. this gave us a single continuous value aik for each element σi in the kth attractor. then, to better represent the experimental measurements from liquid batch cultures where a single average expression level is obtained, we averaged the quantities aik over all the attractors of the network, weighted by the size of the corresponding basin of attraction . thus, contrary to other studies  <cit> , we avoided discarding any attractor reached by the network deeming it as “non-biologically relevant”.

from now on, we will refer to this extension as the windowed discrete model . this statistical treatment of data is supported by experimental studies showing that individual yeast cells in batch cultures exhibit different cell cycle phases, physiological states, and gene expression patterns that result in a heterogeneous population  <cit> . with this procedure, we were able to make a direct and semi-quantitative comparison between the model predictions and the experimental measurements. the wt interaction network considered is shown in fig.  <dig> and the logic rules governing the dynamics of the system are presented on the supplementary information .

the modeled pka-rn starts with the cdc25-ras branch. cdc <dig> abundance and function are dependant on the activity of the hsp <dig> chaperones   <cit> . under optimal temperature and nutrients conditions, cdc <dig> acts as the positive regulator of ras <dig> activity  <cit> , which in turn activates cyr <dig>   <cit> . the product of cyr <dig>  camp, negatively regulates the inhibition imposed by bcy <dig> upon the cs tpk <dig>  tpk <dig>  and tpk <dig>  <cit> . the cs were modeled as a module showing antagonism, as our results  and those from others have suggested  <cit> . we propose that tpk <dig> activity inhibits the activation of ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> by the tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> subunits. the implication for this interaction is that, in a wt background where the three cs are active, only the activity of tpk <dig> is effective in activating ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> chaperones. the mechanistic basis for this antagonism remains to be studied. a systematic study of yeast kinases, made in vitro, showed that some cs have as substrates other cs. in particular, tpk <dig> phosphorylates tpk <dig> and tpk3; tpk <dig> phosphorylates tpk2; and tpk <dig> phosphorylates tpk <dig>  <cit> . it remains to be seen whether the antagonism between the cs is caused by their mutual phosphorylation or whether it occurs via other indirect mechanisms.

as mentioned above , the inhibition of the hse-dependent expression by the pka-rn requires the activation, by the tpks, of an inhibitor of hsf <dig> and skn <dig>  ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  were introduced into the model as repressors of the hse-dependent expression  <cit>  . moreover, based on the expression levels of the triple mutant ssa1Δ ssa2Δ tpk2Δ , we included a third repressor of hsf1/skn <dig> that gets activated exclusively when tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> become the only cs . we believe that a very plausible candidate for such a repressor could be hsp <dig>  given that hsp <dig> binds to hsf <dig>  <cit>  and its deletion increases hse-dependent expression  <cit> . moreover, tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> phosphorylate hsp <dig>  in vitro  <cit> ; although the functional significance of this phosphorylation is unknown. it is plausible that the binding of hsp <dig> to hsf <dig> could be enhanced upon phosphorylation by tpk <dig> or tpk <dig>  but this needs to be addressed experimentally. similarly, tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> could enhance the repression of hsf <dig> by other members of the hsp <dig> family, such as ssb <dig> or ssb <dig>  as it is known that ssb <dig> and ssb <dig> form complexes with hsf <dig> and deletion of their genes also increases hse-dependent expression  <cit> . however, more work is needed to identify the third repressor that is unleashed in the absence of tpk <dig>  in any case, it is important to stress that only by including the three repressors , the experimental measurements could be reproduced by the model.

quantitative comparison between theoretical and experimental results corroborates the proposed regulatory interactions
to validate the simulations of our model, we compared the hse-dependent expression results obtained computationally and those obtained experimentally in a number of mutant strains. population measurements were reported as the ratio / and are presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that the results obtained with the wdm closely resembled the experimental results obtained for all strains. the great concordance between theory and experiment suggests that the novel interactions proposed here for the pka-rn are very likely true. additionally, we also implemented several asynchronous updating schemes and the results that we obtained for the population expression level were almost identical regardless of the synchronicity or asynchronicity of the updating scheme . this feature is quite relevant because, for a particular network  the use of asynchronous updating can significantly change the dynamical attractors of the network  <cit>  to the point that random asynchronous updating has been called inadequate in some scenarios  <cit> . we present the structure of the attractor landscape for the 25 °c wt network using synchronous updating . as this example shows, different basins of attraction varying in size can be visualized. the wdm takes this fact into account to simulate subgroups of cells that might correspond to the different basins of attraction.fig.  <dig> comparison between experimental data and predictions by the wdm. comparison between experimental and theoretical measurements for hse-lacz activity. values are given as average ratios between strain expression and wt expression at 25 °c, making the average expression ratio of the wt strain at 25 °c equal to one. theoretical and experimental values show similar quantitative behavior across strains. moreover, since the theoretical values are no longer discrete, subtle differences occurring experimentally are reproduced also by the model. a ratios at 25 °c, b ratios after a heat shock at 39 °c



in addition to the population measurements, we present simulations for the temporal dynamics of bcy <dig>  camp, hse-lacz, and tpk <dig> that, presumably, could be valid for single-cell measurements . each curve represents a simulation corresponding to a different strain  starting from a random initial condition. at time t <dig>  an increase in the temperature was simulated by turning on the heat shock node. in the absence of ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> , the levels of hse-lacz activity and bcy <dig> increased dramatically, while the levels of camp and tpk <dig> were very low. in the absence of ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  the dynamics of tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> were identical to tpk <dig> . the particular temporal dynamics observed in these simulations  remain to be experimentally confirmed through the use of single-cell measurements. nonetheless the predictions reported in fig.  <dig> fit well the experimental data showing that ssa1Δ ssa2Δ mutants are constitutively resistant to high temperature and display elevated production of hsp’s and slow growth rates  <cit> . deletion of tpk <dig> also decreased the expression of hse-lacz with respect to the wt, but more conspicuously at 39 °c than at 25 °c, consistent with the lower induced thermotolerance level in this mutant .fig.  <dig> single-cell predictions of the temporal dynamics for bcy <dig>  camp, hse-lacz, and tpk <dig> in wt and three mutants. temporal dynamics for four selected nodes: bcy <dig> , camp , hse-lacz , and tpk <dig> . line colors correspond to different strains. simulations were made starting from a random initial condition for each strain. expression and time are given in arbitrary units. background color represents the temperature of the culture: 25 °c  and 39 °c 



CONCLUSIONS
our results clarified the control of hsf <dig> and skn <dig> by the pka-rn, demonstrating that in the w <dig> strain, pka represses hsf <dig> and also skn <dig> via ssa <dig>  ssa <dig> and a third unidentified repressor. no single component of the pka-rn could be used to predict accurately the experimental levels of downstream targets  in all the situations studied. instead, modeling of the pka-rn showed that the observed experimental dynamics arose from the complex interactions of the network making it necessary to analyze the system as a whole. it remains to be unveiled the exact molecular mechanisms by which the pka cs inhibit hsf <dig> and skn <dig> activities. our results indicate that such mechanism must exist and it depends on ssa <dig>  ssa <dig>  and at least a third unidentified repressor. during pka-rn controlled processes, such as pseudohyphal growth and iron uptake, the pka cs display similar antagonistic relationships to those observed during the control of hse-dependent gene expression. tpk <dig>  but not tpk <dig> or tpk <dig>  is required for the induction of pseudohyphal growth and for the inhibition of genes involved in iron uptake  <cit> . additionally, the fact that various updating and averaging schemes produced essentially the same results is quite interesting , as this means that the wdm really captured the population average in batch cultures regardless of the specific updating scheme. to our knowledge, this is the first model with this property. thus, with simple modifications, it can pave the way for the analysis of many other cellular responses at the population level apart from the pka-rn.
