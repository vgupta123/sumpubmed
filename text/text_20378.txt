BACKGROUND
neurotrauma encompasses spinal cord injury  and traumatic brain injury  and can involve damage to both grey and white matter of the cns  <cit> . secondary degeneration is a hallmark of neurotrauma, with spreading damage contributing to deteriorating structure and function  <cit> . oxidative stress contributes to secondary degeneration  <cit>  and occurs when excess reactive oxygen species  and/or reactive nitrogen species  overwhelm the endogenous antioxidant ability of the biological system  <cit> . while reactive species are essential for a range of normal cellular processes, excess leads to oxidative and nitrosative disruptions including protein nitration, dna oxidation and lipid peroxidation , resulting in compromised oxidative metabolism, atp depletion, necrosis, and dysregulated apoptosis  <cit> . if the excess production of reactive species can be limited, oxidative damage to dna, lipids and proteins may be reduced and functional outcomes improved  <cit> .

red/near-infrared light therapy , also known as photobiomodulation or phototherapy, is the therapeutic use of electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths characterized by relatively low energy densities in the red/near-infrared spectrum   <cit> . r/nr-lt has been shown to have therapeutic effects in a range of cns-specific injuries, resulting in improved functional recovery in cases of cns injury  <cit> , retinal degeneration  <cit> , stroke  <cit>  and sci  <cit>  in rat models.

a proposed mechanism underlying r/nir-lt therapy at the cellular level involves the activation of cytochrome c oxidase   <cit> . cox is complex iv of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and is considered to be one of the primary photoacceptors of visible and nir light . when cox absorbs photons at specific wavelengths , it undergoes a conformational change, altering its redox state, increasing its activity resulting in increased levels of atp  <cit> , and improved mitochondrial function  <cit> . irradiation with 670 nm light has been demonstrated to increase cox activity and reduce oxidative stress in an in vivo model of secondary degeneration  <cit> ; these effects consistent with improvements in oxidative metabolism. additional proposed mechanisms of action for r/nir-lt include reduced inflammation and release of nitric oxide from cox  <cit> .

evidence to date indicates that r/nir-lt is an effective and safe antioxidant therapy in a range of preclinical models as well as in clinical settings  <cit> . however, the nest- <dig> clinical trial for stroke, delivering 630/830 nm light using transcranial laser therapy, failed an interim futility analysis  <cit> , perhaps owing to the failure to implement an effective, optimized treatment protocol. it is difficult to identify effective treatment parameters for clinical trials of r/nir-lt given the large range of wavelengths, intensities, pulse structure treatment durations, treatment intervals and delivery methods that have been employed to date in pre-clinical studies and which alter actual dose delivered  <cit> . in particular, varying degrees of penetrance of light, dependent on wavelength can confound attempts to optimise treatment parameters and dissect out potential mechanisms of positive effects. pre-clinical in vivo data to date indicate that  <dig> and 810–830 nm light are effective wavelengths  <cit> . however, it is not yet clear whether efficacy is related to increased penetrance and thereby increased delivery of photons regardless of their delivery wavelength, or to specific effects of light at particular wavelengths. as such, light at short wavelengths may be even more effective than r/nir wavelengths, if problems of penetration can be overcome.

furthermore, effective parameters in one model do not necessarily apply to other models: a comparative study of r/nir-lt efficacy in four cns injury models in rat  indicated that it is necessary to optimize parameters individually for each type of cns injury  <cit> , perhaps due to differing penetrance of the light therapy. therefore, to optimise treatment parameters of r/nir-lt, a single, clinically relevant injury model where light can readily penetrate may assist.

here, we adapt a well-established mouse organotypic spinal cord slice culture model which features the development of myelinated axons by 7 days in vitro   <cit>  to rat, characterise the features of the culture system following partial transection injury and use it to determine the wavelengths and intensities of light therapy that can reduce an indicator of oxidative stress. a rat model was used in order to allow direct comparison to in vivo outcomes  <cit>  in the same species. a model featuring three dimensional tissue architecture was desired as early attempts to optimise r/nir-lt following excitotoxic insult to dissociated rat cns cultures were unsuccessful  <cit> . higher wavelengths of light are known to penetrate tissue more effectively due to the balance of increased absorption and reduced scattering  <cit> . however, if it is merely delivery of photons that provides beneficial effects, shorter wavelengths may be effective in the cell culture context where penetrance through overlying tissue is not required. we therefore assess a range of wavelengths from  <dig> to 860 nm at low, medium and high intensities, where the medium intensity for each wavelength delivers an equivalent number of photons as that delivered by the popular vet <dig> led array .

RESULTS
characterisation of injured spinal cord slice cultures from neonatal rat
spinal cord slices were prepared from postnatal day  0–1 day old piebald virol glaxo  rat pups. in p0– <dig> pups the uninjured spinal cord slice cultures contained cells that were myelin basic protein  immunopositive but had no myelinated axons at  <dig> div ; some axons were myelinated by  <dig> div . immunostained spinal cord sections collected from pvg rat pups similarly showed no myelinated axons in the uninjured spinal cord  or brain stem  at p0–1; or of p <dig> pups . myelinated axons were, however, apparent in spinal cord sections at p <dig> , indicating that the development of myelination in neonatal rat in vitro parallels events in vivo. it is important to note that the myelination of axons in the uninjured rat spinal cord slice cultures was variable and that myelination was not always apparent. electron microscopy revealed that myelin was spirally wrapped around some axons, but compaction of myelin was not always complete . myelination was most consistent in cultures derived from p0– <dig> rat pups and this age of pup was chosen for further analyses.fig.  <dig> characterisation of spinal cord slice cultures from neonatal pvg rat. myelinated axons, indicated by β-iii tubulin  and mbp  colocalisation, were not apparent in spinal cord slice cultures from p0– <dig> rat pups at  <dig> div  but were present at  <dig> div , scale = 50 µm for a, b. immunohistochemical assessment of perfusion fixed spinal cord  and brain stem  from p0– <dig> rat pups showed no evidence of myelinated axons; myelinated axons were observed in spinal cord from p <dig> pups , scale = 50 µm for c–e. electron microscopy of  <dig> div slice cultures revealed the presence of both relatively compact  and some decompacted myelin sheaths  in uncut slice cultures; cut injury 24 h previously resulted in increasingly decompacted myelin  and aggregates of myelin debris , scale = 1 µm. immunoreactivity of 8ohdg  increased following cut injury , as did immunoreactivity of hne , 3-nt  and mnsod . immunoreactivity of all oxidative stress indicators is shown in red, together with mbp immunoreactivity  and hoechst nuclear stain ; representative images adjacent to the cut injury are shown. note that multiple colour immunofluorescence was employed and as such, 8ohdg and hne images show the same field of view, as do 3nt and mnsod images, scale = 50 µm



spinal cord slice cultures from p0– <dig> rat pups were subjected to a cut injury after  <dig> div. approximately half of the width of the slice was transected with a scalpel, resulting in transection of axons within the slice, as ascertained by subsequent immunohistochemical analyses. at 1 day following injury, myelinated axons were observed less frequently than in uninjured control slices; myelin was often decompacted  and aggregates of myelin debris were present . cut injury resulted in increased immunoreactivity of a range of indicators of oxidative stress in the slice cultures 24 h following insult, both adjacent to the cut area and more distally . 8-hydroxyguanosine  immunoreactivity, indicative of oxidative damage to dna was increased in cell bodies, and as expected, was not co-localised with mbp ; the area immediately adjacent to the cut injury is shown . note that immunoreactivity of mbp was not clearly aligned along axons and in places was reminiscent of myelin debris . as noted above, myelin debris was also observed by electron microscopy in cut injured cultures . 4-hydroxynonenal  immunoreactivity, indicative of lipid peroxidation, was increased and co-localised with mbp immunoreactivity , as expected given the high lipid content of myelin. increased immunoreactivity of 3-nitrotyrosine , indicative of protein nitration by oxidative species, serves as a marker for oxidative/nitrosative stress in a range of cell types including myelinating oligodendrocytes  <cit> . immunoreactivity of 3-nt was widespread in the tissue section and immunointensity was slightly increased following cut injury; staining was not apparent in mbp positive areas after injury . similarly, immunoreactivity of manganese superoxide dismutase , an antioxidant enzyme which converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, was slightly increased following injury and seldom co-localised with mbp immunoreactivity, particularly following cut injury .

additional immunohistochemical analyses were conducted to ascertain whether 3nt colocalised with other cell types within the organotypic spinal cord slice cultures. 3nt immunoreactivity was broadly expressed throughout the spinal cord slice cultures , with some colocalisation with ng2+/olig2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells . 3nt occasionally colocalised with iba1+ microglia and ed1+ microglia/macrophages ; a control image where the primary antibody was omitted is provided . 3nt immunoreactivity was not different when comparing areas immediately adjacent to the cut injury, to areas more distal . the data indicate that the spread of oxidative/nitrosative stress occurred relatively rapidly, such that damage was uniformly distributed by 24 h after the injury. given that the spinal cord slice cultures are approximately 4 mm in length, 3nt immunoreactivity spread more than  <dig>  mm in 24 h of culture . while the size of spinal cord lesions in vivo is highly dependent upon the nature and severity of the injury, our data indicate the potential for significant spread of oxidative/nitrosative damage.fig.  <dig> representative images of 3nt immunoreactivity , colocalised with some ng2/olig2 + ve cells  with overlay , and some ed1/iba1− +ve cells  with overlay . higher magnification images of ng2/olig2+  and iba+  cells are provided, together with a control image omitting the 3nt primary antibody . 3nt immunoreactivity was approximately equivalent both adjacent to the cut injury  and more distally ; 3nt , β-iii tubulin , hoechst nuclear stain . scale = 50 µm for images a–f, j, k; scale = 10 µm for g–i. a representative image of a spinal cord slice with cut injury, stained with hoechst nuclear stain ; boxed areas indicate analysis sites close and distal from the injury , scale = 200 µm



as a comparison, spinal cord slice cultures were prepared from p0– <dig> mouse pups, cultured for  <dig> div and then subjected to cut injury. myelinated axons were clearly apparent in uninjured cultures . while lengths of mbp positive myelin were present 1 day after cut injury, myelin debris was apparent . by 7 days after the cut injury, some mbp immunoreactivity colocalised with neurofilament positive axons in the uncut section, but cut axons present in the lower half of the image were unmyelinated . mnsod immunoreactivity was increased, particularly adjacent to the cut site , indicating oxidative stress that may be contributing to demyelination in the area with transected axons and reduced myelination. despite some demyelination in the cut injured mouse slice cultures, it is apparent that myelination was more robust in the mouse slice cultures than in those from rat.fig.  <dig> the effects of cut injury on spinal cord slice cultures from neonatal mouse. spinal cord slice cultures were cultured for  <dig> div, and either not cut , or subjected to cut injury . immunohistochemical analysis of nfh , mbp  and mnsod  with overlay in uncut and cut cultures are shown at  <dig> div , scale = 10 µm. immunohistochemical analysis of nfh , mbp  with overlay  and overlay with hoechst  in cut cultures are shown at  <dig> div , scale = 20 µm



light treatment reduced an indicator of oxidative stress
we used the partially transected rat in vitro spinal cord slice culture model system to compare effects of treatment with a range of wavelengths and intensities of light on oxidative stress, in tissue vulnerable to secondary degeneration. the slice cultures were injured at  <dig> div and tissue was assessed 24 h after cut injury , immediately following two, 30 min light or control treatments 24 h apart. indicators of oxidative stress examined were 3nt, hne and 8ohdg. in 450 nm treated spinal cord slices we detected a significant decrease in the area of 3nt immunoreactivity above a set threshold at the intermediate and high intensities relative to control  , suggesting dose dependence at this wavelength. immunoreactivity of 510 nm treated slices was significantly reduced at both low and high intensities of light compared to control  . in contrast, 660 nm light significantly reduced 3nt immunoreactivity consistently at all three tested intensities  . similarly, 860 nm light significantly reduced 3-nt immunoreactivity at all three intensities compared to control  , albeit to a lesser extent than 660 nm light and with a trend to a biphasic effect. note that there were no statistically significant differences between the varying treatment intensities for 860 nm, or 660 nm light . specificity of the 3-nt antibody was demonstrated using established procedures  <cit> , with increased 3-nt immunoreactivity in the cell culture supernatant of rat pheochromocytoma  neural like cells following treatment with sin- <dig> , a peroxynitrate generator  <cit> , relative to untreated control . the effects of the full range of wavelengths and intensities on immunoreactivity of 8ohdg and hne were assessed following cut injury in the slice cultures. there were no significant effects of any of the wavelengths and intensities of light on 8ohdg immunoreactivity, when considering both the area above a set threshold of intensity or the mean fluorescence intensity of the image . similar results were observed for hne . taken together our data indicate differential effects of r/nir-lt on oxidative damage, with beneficial effects on oxidative/nitrosative damage to protein, but not damage to dna or lipid. a summary table of immunohistochemical outcomes of the study is provided in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> 3-nt immunoreactivity of spinal cord slice cultures following treatment with light of varying wavelengths and intensities. a–d quantification of the area of 3-nt immunoreactivity above a set threshold in spinal cord slice cultures treated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 860 nm light. low , intermediate , or high   intensities were delivered. significant differences from control for each intensity of light delivered are indicated by *. e–q representative images are provided for each treatment intensity and wavelength, imaged immediately adjacent to the cut: 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity  is red, together with β-iii tubulin immunoreactivity to identify axons  and hoechst nuclear stain  for control , 450 nm treated , 510 nm treated , 660 nm treated  or 860 nm treated  cultures. scale = 50 µm for all images. each experiment was conducted three times and data from a single experiment with  <dig> replicates per group are shown

discussion
r/nir-lt is a prospective antioxidant therapy for preserving function following cns injury. the treatment is comparably cheap, non-invasive and easy to administer when using led arrays, and has shown promise in numerous pre-clinical models of cns injury and for some indications in clinical trials for stroke  <cit> . however, lack of optimization using comparative studies has probably contributed to the failure of widespread clinical use of r/nir-lt  <cit> , and there is a need for a standardized, consensus treatment protocol. in this study, we have firstly developed and characterised an in vitro rat model of cns injury suitable for optimizing treatment strategies for neurotrauma. secondly we have used the model to compare a range of wavelengths and intensities for efficacy at reducing oxidative stress, in an effort to provide data useful for optimisation of light therapy, with the added advantage of a reduction in animal numbers required. the intensities of light delivered were designed to encompass those shown to be effective in vivo once penetrance of light has been accounted for  <cit>  and were standardised for the number of photons that reached the surface of the cultures for each wavelength utilised. as such, outcomes between wavelengths are directly comparable. our data suggest 660 nm light to be the most promising wavelength of those tested for reducing oxidative stress, performing consistently and effectively across all three intensity settings.

when light interacts with biological tissue, photons are either absorbed by cellular constituents or scattered  <cit> , with optimal penetration occurring within an “optical window”  <cit> . penetration is dependent on absorption and scattering  <cit> , both of which are greater at shorter, blue/green wavelengths  <cit> . however, in the current in vitro study, penetrance of the different wavelengths is likely to be relatively uniform and the effects of equivalent numbers of photons of different wavelengths were directly assessed. different wavelengths of light have been shown to have different effects upon photoacceptors. for example, wavelength bands of  <dig>  404– <dig>   <dig> and 825 nm  <cit>  have been shown to result in oxidation of cox, and distinct wavelength bands of  <dig>   <dig> and 760 nm reduce cox  <cit> . our observation of increased cox activity in vivo following 670 nm treatment  <cit> , indicate that oxidation of cox by red light increases the activity of the enzyme, at least associated with, and perhaps mediating the therapeutic effect. the results of the current study demonstrating that 660 nm was the most effective of the tested wavelengths at reducing oxidative stress support these findings and indicate that oxidation of cox may mediate beneficial therapeutic effects.

the other tested wavelengths were outside the optimal wavelengths for cox oxidation, and in the case of 450 nm were likely to lead to reduction of the enzyme, perhaps accounting for the limited anti-oxidant efficacy. nevertheless, the highest intensity of light tested in the current study still reduced 3nt immunoreactivity at all four tested wavelengths. absorption of sufficient energy by cox to enable conformational change may have resulted in release of nitric oxide from cox,  <cit>  thereby leading to beneficial effects of wavelengths of light that reduce cox. an alternative mechanism may involve the flavoprotein nadh dehydrogenase , which has been suggested as a photoacceptor involved in blue light therapy  <cit> . its action spectra peak at 448 nm  <cit>  corresponds to the blue wavelength setting used in this study . although activation of nadh-d  <cit>  may promote electron drive through the electron transport chain, this therapeutic effect may be overwhelmed by the detrimental accumulation of superoxide production, perhaps explaining why blue light has produced results reflective of lower efficacy in the current study. it is interesting to note that of the oxidative stress measures assessed, light therapy only resulted in decreases in 3nt immunoreactivity, indicating that oxidative/nitrosative damage to proteins may be limited by the mechanisms described above, whereas damage to dna and lipid oxidation are not. assessment of anti-inflammatory effects of the various wavelengths in the current model would also be interesting to address.

measures of oxidative damage in the current study rely upon the specificity of the commercial antibodies employed. it is challenging to confirm specific immunostaining of oxidative or nitrosative damage: for example, increased nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in tissue reflects nitration of tyrosines in a large range of proteins in response to oxidative and nitrosative stress. as such, western analysis of binding of the antibody will result in a large number of bands and commercial descriptions of these antibodies do not show western blots. nevertheless, our observation of increased 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in the supernatant of cells treated with the peroxynitrate generator sin- <dig>  <cit>  indicates that changes in immunoreactivity occur in response to reactive nitrogen species.

complete transection of the spinal cord, although reflective of complete sci in patients  <cit> , is rarely seen in the clinic  <cit>  and partial transection models are more reflective of clinical sci. furthermore, partial transection models are valuable for assessing axonal regeneration as an additional measure in sci  <cit> , and are increasingly used to assess the effects of combinatorial therapies on axonal regeneration post-injury  <cit> . our data suggest 660 nm as an effective wavelength setting for light therapy. however in order to ensure delivery of sufficient intensity of light at this wavelength to injured tissue in vivo, it is necessary to assess transmission of the light through the overlying tissue. calculated and measured assessments of penetrance of irradiation to the spinal cord range from  <dig> to  <dig>  % depending upon wavelength  <cit> . together with data from the current study, these values can be used to calculate likely effective dosages of r/nir-lt to sci. the lowest effective intensity of 660 nm light tested here was  <dig>  ×  <dig> photons/cm2/s. we have measured that the vet <dig> led array delivers  <dig>  ×  <dig> photons/cm2/s to the surface of the skin when held at 3 cm above the skin  <cit> . given  <dig>  % penetrance, we calculate that only approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> photons/cm2/s penetrate to the sci, perhaps explaining our observed lack of effect of r/nir-lt following sci in vivo  <cit> . the nature of individual cns injuries may impact upon efficacy of r/nir-lt, with differing disease pathologies likely differentially modulated by altered photoacceptor activity. for example, increased glial scarring and immune cell infiltration in sci may overwhelm positive effects of r/nir-lt on oxidative stress. nevertheless, it is apparent that transmission of r/nir-lt must be carefully considered when designing effective r/nir-lt treatment protocols for cns injuries.

CONCLUSIONS
our comparative assessment has resulted in the identification of effective protocols of r/nir-lt that can be adapted to individual cns injuries, bearing in mind the transmission properties of the injured and overlying tissue. we have demonstrated that 660 nm red light is the most effective of the tested wavelengths at reducing oxidative stress, likely due to oxidation of cox. r/nir-lt at 860 nm also significantly reduced oxidative stress at all tested intensities. we conclude that although r/nir-lt appears to be a relatively simple therapy, the choice of dose regime and wavelength utilised needs as much care and attention as designing drug dosing protocols.
