BACKGROUND
human schistosomiasis caused by blood fluke parasites of schistosoma genus, remains an important parasitic disease and a major health economic problem in many tropical and subtropical countries. schistosomes have a complex life cycle that includes six different stages  in different environments: water, definitive host  and intermediate host . during parasite development, signals from the environment are sensed and stimulate physiological, morphological and, biochemical adaptations. oils are shown to stimulate cercarial penetration; hormones and exposure to the snail haemolymph trigger specific physiological adaptations  <cit> . the free living parasite forms display light and geotropism and female development is dependent on signals from the male adult worm through mechanisms not completely understood  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that worm pairing induces changes in gene expression in the female vitelline gland  <cit>  and the accumulation of glutathione and lipids in the male  <cit> . furthermore, microarray analysis revealed distinct differential gene expression profiles between males and females  <cit> . therefore, the success of the parasite infection depends on the assessment at the cellular and molecular levels of the environment and the transmission of signals to physiological regulatory networks that will collectively stimulate adaptations.

the maintenance of homeostasis and complex cellular adaptations in schistosoma mansoni require specific extracellular signals that must be integrated to generate an appropriate response from the sensory receptor via intracellular proteins  <cit> . signal transduction involves non-linearly integrated networks that interact mostly by switching activity status via phosphorylation  and dephosphorylation  of amino acid residues, or the incorporation of gtp. other cellular non-protein messengers include cyclic amp, ca 2+ and diacylglycerol.

protein kinases  play a central role in mediating intracellular signals by adding a phosphate group from atp or gtp to an amino acid residue leading to a conformational change in the target protein that will switch its activation status  <cit> . most pks have a catalytic domain, which binds and phosphorylates target proteins, and a regulatory region. many pks are autophosphorylated or may be phosphorylated by other pks, an interaction regulated by the accessory protein domains  <cit> .

pks are classified into two superfamilies containing the eukaryotic or conventional protein kinases  that share a conserved catalytic domain, and the atypical protein kinases  . the catalytic domain of epks is composed of 250- <dig> amino acids and is divided into  <dig> subdomains with highly conserved individual amino acids and motifs  <cit> . apks are reported to have biochemical kinase activity, but lack sequence similarity to the epk catalytic domain  <cit> . according to their substrate recognition sites, epks are divided broadly into two major classes, serine/threonine kinases  and tyrosine kinases . dual specificity kinases , which phosphorylate serine, threonine, and tyrosine, are also found. epks have been further classified into eight groups based on sequence similarity of their catalytic domains, the presence of accessory domains, and their modes of regulation  <cit> . according to kinbase  <cit> , a database that holds information of pks encoded in the human genome and their homologs in other eukaryotes, the eight epk groups are: agc , camk , ck <dig> , cmgc , rgc , ste , tk  and tkl . a ninth group, called ''other'', consists of a mixed collection of kinases that cannot be classified easily into the previous families  <cit>  .

protein kinases are broadly classified into two major superfamilies . the epks groups, families, and subfamilies adopted in the present work followed the proposed hierarchy described elsewhere  <cit> .

pks are considered druggable targets from the medical and chemical viewpoints as a growing number of pks inhibitors have been developed and approved for treatment of different human disease  <cit> . an example of a successful pk inhibitor is gleevacÂ®, that induces a conformational change in ptk and mimics substrate binding and therefore prevents activation by upstream kinases  <cit> . beyond this, pks have gained interest as targets treatment strategies to fight many parasites, including s. mansoni  <cit> .

the current schistosomiasis treatment frequently does not cure 100% of those treated in high-risk communities and the emergence of schistosoma resistant strains is a real possibility  <cit> . thus, the identification of potential drug targets should be further emphasized. the recent sequencing of s. mansoni genome and large-scale transcriptome projects have yielded crucial information to the identification of new candidate drugs  <cit> . understanding protein structure and function in many model organisms can help elucidate the function of their parasite homologs and further enable the application of such information in drug design and development. the study of the kinase complement  is therefore of major importance for the understanding of the physiology of the organism and also provides insights into how to disrupt the fine adaptative mechanisms. the present work aimed at analyzing the s. mansoni predicted proteome data in order to identify all epks encoded in the genome of this parasite. for this purpose, we combined computational approaches such as sequence similarity searches using hidden markov models  and distance-based phylogenetic analyses. the functional annotation was performed mainly to yield insights into the signaling process related to the complex lifestyle of s. mansoni.

RESULTS
the schistosoma mansoni epkinome
the epk complement of s. mansoni, defined as the epkinome, was identified by searching the parasite predict proteome with a hmm profile of the epk catalytic domain of five selected organisms. this analysis revealed  <dig> epks in the s. mansoni predicted proteome, representing  <dig> % of the total proteins encoded in the parasite genome. although the total number of protein kinases found across the analyzed species varies greatly , the percentage values in respect to the genomes of protozoan and helminth parasites as well as other eukaryotes from kinbase range only between  <dig>  to 2% .

amino acid sequences corresponding to the conserved catalytic domain of epks were aligned by mafft  <cit>  and further used in phylogenetic analysis based on a distance method as implemented in phylip  <cit> . the dataset for each epk group also included the epk homologs from six other eukaryotes: homo sapiens, mus musculus, drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and brugia malayi. this approach allowed us to classify the s. mansoni epkinome at the group, family, and/or subfamily levels based on the hierarchy proposed elsewhere  <cit> , and sometimes provided insights into kinase function and evolution. detailed information is available in the additional file  <dig> that contains, among other things, all s. mansoni epks with the corresponding identifier from the genome project linked to schistodb database  <cit> . schistodb http://www.schistodb.net allows the community to access to all sequences, annotations and other data types integrated into the genomic information. it also provides several tools to analyze retrieve and display the data. in the schistodb it is possible to encounter, for each epk, the development expression stages by est evidence, information about orthologs, gene onthology  function, metabolic pathways, structural information, pdb structures, and links to external databases such as the tdr database  <cit> . the tdr database contains additional information for s. mansoni genes like antigenicity, essentiality, phenotypes and associated compounds .

as shown in figure  <dig>  s. mansoni proteins have representatives in the main epk groups. epks that do not fall into these groups are categorized as "other" in which multiple families have been defined. the s. mansoni largest epk group is cmgc, a feature unique to this parasite, and the smallest group is rgc, a common feature shared with many of the analyzed organisms .

of the  <dig> epks identified in s. mansoni proteome, only  <dig> were experimentally studied as highlighted in the supplementary material  and the others  <dig> epks were previously annotated only by automatic methods based on sequence similarity searches  <cit> .

s. mansoni epks were examined for the presence of the  <dig> smaller subdomains present in the catalytic domain and also for the presence of a lysine in subdomain ii and aspartic acids residues in subdomain vib and vii, which are known to play essential roles in the kinase function  <cit> . according to our analysis,  <dig> proteins are predicted to be catalytically inactive epks, as they lack one or more of the three essential amino acid residues in the catalytic domain , including all members of s. mansoni rgc group .

approximately 2% of the s. mansoni epk remain unclassified once they do not have similarity to any known pk family. all these proteins have a truncated catalytic domain probably because of an incorrect protein prediction. the unclassified epks from c. elegans, d. melanogaster, h. sapiens and s. cerevisiae range from 19% to about 38% their kinomes.

serine/threonine kinases
agc group
around  <dig> families have been classified as part of the agc group in eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . in s. mansoni, most agc proteins belong to pka  , dmpk  , pkc   and pkg  families. other s. mansoni proteins have only one representative in the remaining agc families . according to our phylogenetic analysis, s. mansoni has no homolog of the yank  family .

the most significant difference between pka and pkg family members is that in pka, the regulatory and catalytic activities are performed by separate gene products known as pka-r and pka-c, respectively, whereas in pkg the cnmp-binding  and catalytic domains are usually present in the same polypeptide  <cit> . the inactive conformation of pka is a heterotetramer of two pka-r and two pka-c subunits, while pkg exists as a homodimer  <cit> . s. mansoni processes five homologs of the pka-c subunit , and six predicted of pkc-r subunit  allowing for a variety of different holoenzymes to be formed in this parasite. some studies demonstrated that pkg proteins of toxoplasma  <cit>  and eimeria  <cit>  and pkg and pka proteins of plasmodium  <cit>  are essential as the inhibitors causes an anti-parasite effect in these organisms. recently it was shown that inhibition of the smpka-c subunit , expressed in adult worms of s. mansoni, resulted in the death of the parasites  <cit> . this result and the range of holoenzymes that can be formed, indicate that genes in this family are critical for the development of s. mansoni and may represent good targets for drug development.

pkc belongs to a large protein family that is classified into four important subfamilies: pkc alpha subfamily, that contain the conventional pkcs  and are sensitive to diacylglycerol  and ca2+; pkc eta and delta subfamilies containing the novel pkcs  which are regulated by dag alone; and pkc iota subfamily, that contain the atypical pkcs , and are insensitive to both compounds  <cit> . pkc is considered to be a mechanistic regulator of development in vertebrates, playing a key role in cell growth and differentiation  <cit> . s. mansoni has representatives in the three main pkc subfamilies mentioned above  but lacks homologs in the delta subfamily, present in c. elegans, d. melanogaster, m. musculus, and h. sapiens. the two pkc alpha proteins found in s. mansoni , belong to the pkcÎ²i isoform and were recently characterized  <cit> . both are associated with the neural mass, excretory vesicle, ridge cyton, tegument and germinal cells in schistosomula and miracidium, suggesting a possible role in larval transformation  <cit> .

one protein in agc group, smp_ <dig>  remains unclassified. in the phylogenetic tree, this protein appears more closely related to the grk  family , despite the good conservation of the catalytic domain, this protein lacks the accessory domain that is characteristic of the grk proteins . furthermore, smp_ <dig> does not form a clade with the grk family members according to our phylogenetic tree, which corroborates its divergence in relation to grk homologs in other eukaryotes .

interestingly, according to schistodb  <cit>  est evidences, the two most highly transcribed epks  in s. mansoni, belong to the dmpk family of the agc group, mainly in cercariae, schistosomula, eggs and adult worms. this finding is interesting as these are the four life cycle stages of the parasite which are in contact with the definitive host. in c. elegans proteins of dmpk family are expressed in hypodermal cells and are involved in embryonic elongation  <cit> .

camk group
the divalent cation calcium  is one of the ions most widely used as a second messenger in cellular signaling. a significant portion of calcium-mediated signaling is controlled by calmodulin-binding kinases. some members of the camk group are dependent on the binding of ca2+/cam  <cit> . in the s. mansoni epkinome,  <dig> proteins were classified as camk with the vast majority  belonging to the camkl  - like family. a similar number was found in other organisms analyzed here . s. mansoni also contain members of dapk , mapkapk , mlck , and phk  families in the camk group .

mlck is a ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase whose only known substrate is myosin ii regulatory light chain  <cit> . the primary function of mlck is to stimulate muscle contraction through the phosphorylation of the myosin ii regulatory light chain , a eukaryotic motor protein that interacts with filamentous actin. although mlck has only one known substrate , this protein is linked to a variety of cellular processes due to the diverse biological function of myosin ii  <cit> . two distinct smooth muscle mlck genes were identified in s. mansoni , although no homologs were identified for the non-smooth muscle vertebrate mlck through our phylogenetic analysis. this likely reflects the absence of a striated muscle in this parasite.

dcamkl  is a protein that regulates the microtubule cytoskeleton and in the chick is specifically expressed in the developing brain  <cit> . cask is a protein that participates in cell adhesion  <cit> . according to our phylogenetic analysis, a single homolog of the dcamkl  and cask  families were found in s. mansoni .

while the camk <dig>  family is encoded by four genes in humans, only a single camk <dig> gene, with two predicted alternative spliced transcripts, was identified in the s. mansoni genome . s. mansoni camk <dig> was recently identified as putative target for drug development after comparative chemogenomics approach using the s. mansoni proteome and the proteome of two model organisms, c. elegans and d. melanogaster.  <cit> . the function of this protein in s. mansoni is still unknown. in sea urchin, camk <dig> is required for nuclear envelope breakdown following fertilization  <cit> .

cmgc group
cmgc kinases are relatively abundant in s. mansoni, a feature that can be explained by the requirement to control cell proliferation and to ensure correct replication and segregation of organelles, which together are essential mechanisms for parasites with a complex life cycle. in the cmgc group, all of the main families are conserved between s. cerevisiae, c. elegans, m. musculus, h. sapiens, and s. mansoni, including cdk , mapk , gsk , clk , srpk , ck <dig> , and dyrk   and rck.

s. mansoni has  <dig> cdks, the same number was found in c. elegans , including homologs of all subfamilies  . on the other hand, only one rck family protein  was identified in the parasite. the rck proteins are similar to mammalian mak , which have been implicated in spermatogenic meiosis and in signal transduction pathways for sight and smell  <cit> .

gsk family is represented by  <dig> proteins in s. mansoni. one of those  was selected as putative target for drug development after comparative chemogenomics approach  <cit> . gsk proteins are involved in development and cell proliferation, are overexpressed in colon carcinomas and positively regulates the wnt signaling pathway during embryonic development and oocyte-to-embryo transition in c. elegans  <cit> .

the mapk signaling pathways are some of the best characterized signaling systems. s. mansoni contains nine mapks, compared to seven in d. melanogaster and  <dig> in c. elegans. as shown in figure  <dig>  mammals have, at least five mapk cascades described; these include the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  cascade, which regulates cell growth and differentiation, the c-jun n-terminal kinase /stress-activated protein kinase , and the p <dig> mapk cascades, which function mainly in stress responses such as inflammation and apoptosis  <cit> . in d. melanogaster and c. elegans, the mapk pathways are involved in critical cellular and developmental processes  <cit> . s. cerevisiae has four distinct mapk signaling pathways that are likely mediators of responses to pheromone, nutritional starvation, and cellular or osmotic stress  <cit> . the mapk signaling pathways are well conserved in s. mansoni , including representatives of the subfamilies erk, p <dig>  jnk, and, nlk but lacks members of erk <dig> that are part of a signaling pathways found mainly in mammals . each subfamily is activated by different stimuli that generate different biological responses  <cit> . in s. mansoni only one protein was identified in jnk  subfamily. jnk proteins play key roles in human cell function  <cit>  and in the development of c. elegans worms  <cit> . jnk may have an important role in schistosome survival and represent a good target for experimental approaches.

ste group
in s. mansoni, the ste group includes seven ste <dig> , two ste <dig> , and  <dig> ste <dig>  kinases . the large number of ste family members in s. mansoni could translate into an enormous potential for downstream signal specificity and diversity. smslk  is a ste <dig> family protein, recently characterized in s. mansoni, which is able to activate protein mapk/jnk in human embryonic kidney  cells as well as in xenopus oocytes. in addition, imunofluorescence showed that smslk was abundant in the tegument of adult schistosomes  <cit> . these findings indicate that signals sensed in the environment by many different proteins may activate the mapk cascade that will generate an adaptive physiological response. futhermore, molecules that activate the mapk pathways, as some hormone and cytokine signals, are not found in the s. mansoni predicted proteome . it has been demonstrated that the parasite takes advantage of host proteins for its growth and development  <cit> . other epks such as members of the pka, pkc, raf and receptor protein tyrosine kinases  families, also participate in mapk signaling pathway. rtks are anchored to the membrane and have an important role in transmitting the signal from the extracellular to cytoplasm   <cit> .

in c. elegans genome studies such as classical forward genetic and rna interference screens and systematic targeted gene knockout revealed genes that are essential to the organism  <cit> . although the off-target and non-specific effect of rnai  <cit> , in s. mansoni this is one of the best approaches to explore the functional property of the genes since the knockout experiments are not yet available for schistosomes  <cit> . by analyzing the phylogenetic trees of the present work, it was possible to identify the proteins of s. mansoni that have homologs in c. elegans and display lethality and sterile phenotypes by rnai . interestingly, most essential proteins in table  <dig> belong to the cmgc and ste groups, suggesting the involvement of these proteins in signaling pathways that culminate in essential cellular processes.

orthology relationships were inferred based on phylogenetic trees. rnai phenotype for c. elegans were visualized by recent work  <cit>  that relied on identification and analysis of essential genes.

ck <dig> group
the two smallest groups found in the s. mansoni epkinome were ck <dig> and rgc . in contrast, in c. elegans ck <dig> is the largest group and rgc is dramatically expanded. however, these expansions are a unique feature of c. elegans, as compared to other eukaryotes selected for this analysis . the ck <dig> group consists of three main epk families: ck <dig>  vrk , and ttbk  that formed three individual clusters in the phylogenic tree . s. mansoni has representatives in each of these families also found in c. elegans, d. melanogaster, m. musculus, h. sapiens, s. cerevisiae and b. malayi kinomes. the nematodes, c. elegans and b. malayi, still have two other families that seem to be specific to this taxonomic group, ttbkl and worm <dig>  the worm <dig> family was identified only in caenorhabditis so far. the diversification of the ck <dig> group in c. elegans may be an adaptation allowing for enhanced dna repair in response to excessive exposure to environmental mutagens  <cit> . one ck <dig> encoding gene  functions in spermatogenesis, and at least half of the proteins in this group are selectively expressed in c. elegans sperm as shown by microarray analysis  <cit> . the role of these proteins in the parasite s. mansoni is unclear.

tyrosine kinases
tk group
ptks can be classified, based on the presence or absence of transmembrane domains, into receptor tyrosine kinase  that relay intracellular signals  <cit> , and cytoplasmatic tyrosine kinase . s. mansoni kinome contains  <dig> rtks and  <dig> ctks. the  <dig> rtk include two insrs , four egfrs , two vkrs , a representative for ephs , ror, cck <dig> , and musk  families, besides three unknown receptors.

two insrs in s. mansoni, smir- <dig>  and smir- <dig>  present distinct functions during parasite development. these two receptors are well clustered within the insr families but showed to be more divergent than the mammalian and d. melanogaster proteins . smir- <dig> was localized in the muscles, intestinal epithelium, and basal membrane of adult male and female worms and at the periphery of schistosomula, mainly in the tegument  <cit> . smir- <dig> co-localized in schistosome tegument with glucose transporters suggesting a role in the regulation of glucose uptake which is an essential nutrient for the intra-mammalian stages of s. mansoni. smir- <dig>  in contrast, was distributed in the parenchyma of adult males and females indicating a possible involvement of the receptor in parasite growth. s. mansoni is the first invertebrate with two insulin receptors characterized that seem to have distinct functions, as in vertebrates  <cit> . mammals have two insr members; insulin-like growth factor receptor , which has a role in controlling growth, and  which has specialized in metabolic regulation  <cit> .

in c. elegans egfr signaling induces behavioral quiescence  <cit> . one s. mansoni egfr homolog  was localized in the parasite muscle and perhaps related to muscle development or function  <cit> . vertebrate egf activates s. mansoni egfr and the downstream classical erk pathway , indicating the conservation of egfr function in s. mansoni  <cit> . moreover, human egf was shown to increase protein and dna synthesis as well as protein phosphorylation in parasites, supporting the hypothesis that host egf could regulate schistosome development  <cit> . the similarity of schistosome proteins to sex hormone receptors of mammalian hosts provides a good example of host parasite relationship, where the adult worm depends on the host hormone synthesis for their maturation and reproduction  <cit> .

five s. mansoni proteins are not clustered with the main rtk families as shown in our phylogenetic analyses . three of them have a truncated catalytic domain  and two are specific rtk with a venus flytrap domain . vkr is a family of receptors found in invertebrates, especially in insects. one s. mansoni vkr protein, smp_ <dig> , was recently studied  <cit> . we identified another protein  clustering with smvkr  with a high similarity. despite the similarity of the catalytic domain of vkr protein with the irs, these two proteins are not clustered with insr family. in this respect, the most interesting finding is that vkr family members are not found in mammals and could represent good targets for drug development as a specific inhibitor for this family will probably not affect any protein of the host  <cit> .

the ctks in s. mansoni are represented by  <dig> different families . smtk <dig>  and smtk <dig>  - src family members, and smtk <dig>  - syk family, are present in reproductive organs and possibly involved in the development of gonads and multiplication of germinal and vitelline cells  <cit> . abl proteins of s. mansoni  were recently studied using a abl specific inhibitor . the results showed an important morphological alteration in adult worms of s. mansoni that led to the death of the parasites  <cit> . c. elegans contains  <dig> members of the fer family, while only a single member, smfes, was found in s. mansoni. the fer gene of s. mansoni  exhibits the characteristic features of fes/fps/fer  ptks. by immunolocalization assays it was shown that smfes is particularly expressed at the terebratorium of miracidia and tegument of cercaria and schistosomula skin-stage. these findings suggest that smfes may play a role in signal transduction pathways involved in larval transformation after penetration into intermediate and definitive hosts  <cit> .

rgc group
proteins in this group share sequence similarity to the catalytic domain  found in proteins of the tk group  <cit> . the rgc group is underrepresented in most species, except in c. elegans that has a large expansion of these proteins and s. cerevisiae that has no protein with similarity to the tk catalytic domain . only three rgc members were identified in the s. mansoni epkinome. all of them are more closely related to the mammalian and insect families than the worm family. c. elegans and b. malayi rgc proteins form at least two different families noticeably more divergent from s. mansoni, d. melanogaster, m. musculus, and h. sapiens families as suggested by our phylogenetic analysis . most rgc proteins remain functionally uncharacterized. in c. elegans, several rgc proteins are highly expressed in restricted sets of neurons and are implicated in chemosensation. one rgc is involved in dauer stage formation  <cit> . other parasites such as l. major, t. brucei, t. cruzi and p. falciparum also lack homologs in the rgc group  <cit> . the three s. mansoni rgc proteins have an amino acid substitution in the aspartic acid in subdomain vib of the catalytic domain, rendering them catalytically inactive. although the catalytic center of an enzyme is usually highly conserved, there have been reports of proteins, like those of the rgc group of epks, with substitutions at essential catalytic positions, which convert the enzyme into a catalytically inactive form. a recent study showed that inactive enzymes are found in a large variety of families conserved among metazoan species and they have lost their catalytic activity, have adopted new functions, and are involved in regulatory processes  <cit> .

hybrid protein kinase
tkl group
tkl consists of a divergent group that is phylogenetically close to the tyrosine kinases . however, tkl proteins have an unusual catalytic domain that is a hybrid between the serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases  <cit> . the catalytic domain may display greater similarity to the tyrosine catalytic domain  or to the serine/threonine catalytic domains   <cit> . in s. mansoni, the tkl group includes mlk , lisk , raf, ripk , stkr , and lrrk   families. of the  <dig> tkl proteins found in s. mansoni,  <dig> display greater similarity to the serine/threonine catalytic domain and four  to the tyrosine catalytic domain. s. mansoni has no homologous proteins of the irak  receptor-associated kinase) family that is present in c. elegans, b. malayi, d. melanogaster, homo sapiens, and m. musculus . although s. cerevisiae does not have any tkl protein homologue, other fungal species do contain such proteins  <cit> . raf  is a tkl family that plays an important role in the activation of ste proteins in the signaling cascade that culminates in the activation of erk1/ <dig>   <cit> . a recent study showed that blocking the expression of the homolog of the s. mansoni raf protein  in c. elegans by rnai, generate a sterile phenotype, which supports the hypothesis of the involvement of raf protein in the germline development, somatic gonad development, oogenesis, spermatogenesis, ovulation or fertilization . raf protein may represents a good target for drug development in s. mansoni.

a stkr member that binds to tgfÎ²  is a membrane receptor that can be divided into two subclasses . the type ii receptor binds tgfÎ² and then recruits the type i receptor. the tgfÎ² type i receptor was cloned in s. mansoni  and it was found to be localized in the parasite surface  <cit> . other type i strk  was identified in the s. mansoni predicted proteome and was not experimentally characterized so far . three type ii stkrs  are proteins identified in the same contig which were predicted to be a product of alternative splicing. a recent study revealed the presence of two transcripts that are translated into two different isoforms of type ii receptor  <cit> . these transcripts are produced from the same gene by alternative splicing of the last two exons. the authors indicated that these different type ii receptors might signal in different cells or development stages. furthermore, that study showed that in the presence of human tgfÎ², smtÎ²rii  activated smtÎ²ri. the results also provide evidence for the role for the tgf-Î² signaling pathway in male-induced female reproductive development  <cit> .

other group
the other group consists of a mixed collection of kinases with representatives in higher eukaryotes, including scy <dig>  nek , pek, haspin, wee, nak , ulk , ire , plk , aur , and cdc <dig>  families . our analysis showed that 15% of the s. mansoni epkinome do not fall into any of the eight major groups, but include  <dig> smaller and conserved families.

accessory domains
the structure of the catalytic domain of many epks is highly conserved across distinct organisms because of the fact that all epks recognize and bind atp at common sites. however, only the catalytic domain  is sufficiently divergent to enable the discrimination of groups, families, and subfamilies .

most epks also have a second domain that is involved in protein-protein interaction and allosteric regulation of the catalytic domain  <cit> . in this work, only the catalytic domain sequence was used in the phylogenetic analyses. interestingly, when the information on the epk accessory domains was integrated into the phylogenies, we observed a correlation between diversity of protein architecture and the phylogenetic patterning. we also believe that the diversification of the epks happened a long time ago.

the analysis of the sequence domain data from pfam  <cit>  showed that approximately 30% of s. mansoni epks are multi-domain proteins containing various regulatory and signaling domains tethered to catalytic kinase domains . it is known that the distinct protein architectures reflect functional differences among proteins  <cit> . hence, understanding the mechanisms that generate such diverse repertoire of protein architectures is essential to the comprehension of the biological function of the epks. furthermore, we observed in epks of s. mansoni some unusual architecture that probably occurs by domain fusion and recruitment , generating specificity towards cognate substrates and regulators in this parasite.

the most common pfam accessory domains found in s. mansoni kinases are pkinase_c  all found in the agc group; c1_ <dig>  found in the agc and tkl groups; sh <dig>  all found in the tk group; and sh <dig>  found in tk and tkl groups. these domains are commonly found in protein kinase families as we observed in other species from kinbase  <cit> .

more than 40% of s. mansoni agc group have the pkinase_c domain associated with the catalytic domain. the c1_ <dig> domain is conserved in n-terminal regions of all pkc proteins of s. mansoni  and has been shown to bind pe  and dag . dag is an important second messenger and phorbol esters are analogues of dag  <cit> . the c1_ <dig> domain is present in one or two copies depending on the isozyme of pkc . cnmp_binding is a n-terminal domain of pkg proteins that bind cyclic nucleotides  to relieve the inhibition of the catalytic domain  <cit> . the akt protein of s. mansoni  has an unusual domain combination  as the two c-terminal domains  are not found in d. melanogaster, c. elegans, m. musculus and h. sapiens.

cask is a member of the camk group and plays a key role in establishing inter-cellular contacts and plasticity at cellular junctions  <cit> . the accessory domains found in s. mansoni cask protein  are conserved in higher eukaryotes. however, the upf <dig>  is uncharacterized  <cit>  and possesses an unusual domain found in the c-terminal region of s. mansoni cask protein . the long protein kinase mlck  possesses a large number of ig repeats  that, in other species, are involved in a variety of functions, including cell-cell recognition, cell-surface receptors, muscle structure and the immune system  <cit> , and fn <dig> repeats, that is an approximately  <dig> amino acid domain commonly found in a variety of organisms.

the cmgc and ck <dig> groups have none or a few accessory domains in s. mansoni. however, it is known that small regions in these proteins play an important role in recognizing and binding to the substrate  <cit> . for example, the cd domain  is a c-terminal region of mapk proteins composed of a set of negatively charged amino acids that is used to anchor protein activators , substrates  and inactivating proteins   <cit> . thus, this region governs a series of signal transduction in the cascade of reactions of mapks. other regions, including the ed  site, working with the cd domain and ensuring specificity and interaction strength  <cit> .

pbd  and c-terminal cnh domain are usually found in the ste <dig> families . pbd binds to cdc42-gtpases activating the signaling cascade which act upstream in the mapk cascade. the cnh domain interacts with the small gtpase and regulating the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> .

the sh <dig> and sh <dig>  domains are common found in ctk proteins. sh <dig> function as regulatory modules of intracellular signaling cascades and it was found in eight out of  <dig> s. mansoni ctks. fer ptk is usually composed of three domains, fhc domain, sh <dig>  and c-terminal kinase domain as it occurs in fer proteins of h. sapiens, m. musculus, and d. melanogaster. however, the s. mansoni fer protein   <cit>  and the  <dig> fer proteins of c. elegans seems to have lost the n-terminal fhc domain . rtks are characterized by an extracellular domains, a membrane spanning segment and an intracellular kinase domain  <cit> . the extracellular ligand binding domain of egfr and insr proteins are composed of two receptor_l sandwiching a furin_like domain . smvkr is composed of an unusual extracellular venus flytrap module  linked through a single transmembrane domain to an intracellular tyrosine catalytic domain similar to that of the insulin receptor and a putative function in reproduction and development was observed  <cit> . other extracellular domains found in s. mansoni are ephrin_ibd  in the ephrin recptors  and ig domains  in cck <dig> proteins .

in conclusion, the protein architecture, including the accessory domains, may indicate potential protein partners. signaling roles of schistosome specificities or unusual architectures are of special biological interest.

CONCLUSIONS
this study allowed us to identify and classify  <dig> epks encoded in the predicted proteome of s. mansoni. together, these proteins represent  <dig> % of the proteome and indicate that protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism for regulating the complex life cycle of the parasite. we improve the functional annotation of 40% of s. mansoni epks  by applying a phylogenetic framework. moreover, it was possible to gain insights into kinase function once 94% of the s. mansoni epkinome had previously an unknown function. s. mansoni has proteins in each epks group. most of them are clearly clustered with known kinases from other eukaryotes with no family being exclusively found or expanded in s. mansoni. some proteins are not clustered with the main epk family as the catalytic domain is truncate, indicating that the current gene/protein predictions require further refinement. proteins were mentioned as potential targets for drug design and development as they may play an essential function in the parasite. furthermore new and effective drugs bind pks close but not in the atp site and occlude atp access to the kinase to retard enzyme activity  <cit> . so, proteins of s. mansoni with a sequence highly similar to host proteins can be used as protein targets since the inhibitor binds in non-conserved residues outside the atp site. also, the unusual domains found in s. mansoni can be used for constructing more specific s. mansoni inhibitors. moreover, as we continue this work, we will highlight the biochemical and physiological adaptations of s. mansoni in response to diverse environments during parasite development, vector interaction, and host infection.

through phylogenetic analysis, we have improved the functional annotation of 40% of s. mansoni epks by changing protein classification at the group and family levels, assigning subfamilies, and classifying proteins without any previous classification.
