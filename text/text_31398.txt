BACKGROUND
the thymus is the primary immune organ providing naïve t cells for peripheral immune tissues  <cit> . theoretically, thymic injury can cause serious consequences, which are related to local tissue homeostasis and immune development, especially in young individuals with an immature immune system. due to the existence of the blood-thymus barrier, the thymus was once deemed to be immune privileged  <cit> . however, in mammals, multiple pathogens can target the thymus and cause thymic injury, including extensive cell death, tissue structure abnormality, organ atrophy and functional disorder, including recent thymic emigrant abnormality and t cell tolerance to pathogens  <cit> . in birds, pathogens including viruses , bacteria  and parasites  can also induce thymic atrophy . therefore, thymus injury also may be a common occurrence during infection in birds.

salmonella typhimurium  is one of the most deleterious food-borne pathogens that can induce typhoid fever and enteritis through infected chicken eggs and meat  <cit> . stm infection could also cause the death of newly hatched chicks  <cit> . stm infection has been reported to induce thymic atrophy, thymocyte death and a modest decrease of recent t cell export in mice  <cit> . moreover, one study indicated that the thymic injury induced by stm in mice was mediated by intracellular jnk signaling and its downstream effectors, including reactive oxygen species  and inflammatory cytokines   <cit> . in chickens, several studies have indicated that stm infection can induce expression of chemokines and cytokines  in the spleen, liver and intestinal tissues, which may contribute to the host defense against stm  <cit> . however, unlike in mammals, few studies have reported the impact of stm infection on the thymus in birds, and the molecular mechanism of chicken thymus response to stm infection is largely unknown.

in the present study, we evaluated the thymic injury and potential mechanisms induced by both stm and salmonella lps in newly hatched chicks. we found that both stm and lps stimulation could induce acute thymus injury in chicks. the effects of lps are faster than that of stm. moreover, we found that the tlr4-fos/jun signaling pathway may play a key role in this process. our results offer novel evidence for the molecular mechanism of the thymus injury induced by salmonella lps.

RESULTS
thymic atrophy after lps treatment
newly hatched chicks were injected i.p. with 5 × 104 cfu/ml stm or 75 % saline  for the challenge of stm, and with 50 mg/kg salmonella lps or 75 % saline  for the challenge of lps. the thymic weight was assessed at 0 ~ 120 h post treatment . compared with saline treatment, treatment with lps derived from stm resulted in the maximum 35 % loss of thymus weight  and 20 % decrease of thymus index  at  <dig> hpt; meanwhile, it caused 17 % loss of thymus weight  and 17 % loss of thymus index  at  <dig> hpt . the thymus weight was restored to the normal level at  <dig> hpt . moreover, there is a dosage effect of lps on thymic weight  and index  . compared with saline treatment, stm infection resulted in the maximum 43 % loss of thymus weight  and 26 % decrease of thymus index  at  <dig> hpt compared with controls, and these effects were attenuated at  <dig> hpt . furthermore, the thymus maintained structural integrity with distinct boundaries of the medulla and cortex at different stages of lps treatment . therefore, both stm and salmonella lps treatment induced acute thymic atrophy, but the maximum lps-induced thymic atrophy occurred 36 h earlier than that caused by stm infection.fig.  <dig>

thymocyte death after lps treatment
we assessed thymocyte death using two classic methods, the formamide-mab assay, which recognizes damaged single-strand dna in early apoptotic cells , and the tunel assay, which detects low-molecular-weight damaged dna fragments in late apoptotic cells or necrotic cells  <cit> . these damaged dna fragments are abundant in apoptotic cells . the formamide-mab assay revealed that the maximum lps-induced thymocyte death occurred at  <dig> hpt, which was 3-fold higher than that of the control . additionally, the positive cells were about 2-fold higher at  <dig> and  <dig> hpt. these effects have also been detected by the tunel assay. the results of tunel assay were almost identical to that of the formamide-mab assay, and the tunel positive cells were about 5-fold higher than that of the control at  <dig> hpt . during stm infection, the maximum rate of thymocyte death occurred at 36 h, and the positive cells were 4-fold higher than that of control . they were attenuated by 2-fold  at  <dig> hpt as detected by the formamide-mab assay . therefore, both stm and salmonella lps treatment induced thymocyte death, and the maximum death of thymocytes occurred 24 ~ 36 h ahead of the peak organic atrophy. moreover, lps-induced thymocyte death occurred 24 h earlier than that stimulated by stm infection , which coincided with the phenomenon of lps-mediated thymus atrophy ahead of that induced by stm infection . in all cases, thymocyte death was mainly located in the thymic cortex.fig.  <dig>

maintenance of cht1+ and cd4+/cd8+ cell ratios at 36 h after lps treatment
in order to analyze changes in cell sub-populations during lps stimulation, we detected cht1+, cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in the spleen and cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in the thymus at 36 h after lps treatment using flow cytometry. the development of t cells in thymus undergoes stages of cd4-cd8- double negative  cells, cd4 + cd8+ double positive  cells and cd4 + cd8- or cd4-cd8+ single positive  cells  <cit> . t cells migrated from thymus to the periphery express cht <dig> for a short time and cht1+ is typically used to assess recent thymic export . under lps stimulation, the proportion of cht1+ cells in spleen tissue was not significantly different from that of the saline control group in this study. proportions of dp and sp t cells also showed no significant difference in the spleen and thymus . therefore, both cht <dig> cell ratios in spleen and cd4+/cd8+ t cell ratios in thymus or spleen were not significantly changed at 36 h after lps treatment.fig.  <dig> impact of salmonella lps on t cell population in chick thymus and spleen. newly hatched chicks were injected i.p. with saline or 50 mg/kg salmonella lps and then sacrificed at  <dig> hpt  to analyze the impact of salmonella lps on chick t cell populations. a cht1+ cell ratios in spleen decreased but not significantly. b, c no significant change of cd4+/cd8+ t cells in chick thymus  or spleen  was observed. all data are presented as means ± sd. statistically significant differences between lps and saline groups at each time point were determined using student’s t-test



identification of dets in thymus after lps challenge
to determine the molecular mechanism of the effects induced by lps treatment, we detected gene expression profiles in the thymus at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpt using the rna-seq method. in total,  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were mapped to  <dig>  transcripts. in order to identify the differential expressed transcripts , transcript expression levels at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpt were compared with those at  <dig> hpt. as a result,  <dig> dets  were identified at  <dig> hpt,  <dig> dets  at  <dig> hpt and  <dig> dets  at  <dig> hpt  . we found the maximum number of dets at  <dig> hpt and the minimum number of dets at  <dig> hpt. many of the top  <dig> up- and down-expressed transcripts were related to immune responses, including avd, il8l <dig>  il4i <dig> and il <dig> .fig.  <dig> analysis of dets in chick thymus after salmonella lps treatment. newly hatched chicks were injected i.p. with saline or 50 mg/kg salmonella lps and then sacrificed at defined time points  to perform transcriptome analysis of the thymus. dets were determined using the mars model in degseq package between different time points  with the same cut-off . a numbers of dets at different time point. b top ten up- and down-expressed genes at different time point. the positive values indicate up-expression and negative values indicate down-expression



the expression patterns of ten genes in chick thymus were detected by qpcr
to validate the results of rna-seq, ten up-expressed genes, including tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  avd, il8l <dig>  bpi, socs <dig>  il6st, il1r <dig>  hspb <dig> and nov, were chosen for qpcr detection. in order to accurately describe the expression patterns of genes, thymic tissue rna at eight time points, including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 120 h after lps challenge, were collected for qpcr detection. the results showed that the gene expression patterns detected by qpcr were similar to those of obtained by the rna-seq method . there was a significant correlation between the changes of genes detected by rna-seq and qpcr methods . this finding confirmed the reliability of the rna-seq data. based on the qpcr results, all ten genes were up-expressed at 12 ~ 24 h after lps treatment. moreover, the tlr <dig>  avd, il8l <dig>  bpi, socs <dig> and il1r <dig> genes were up-expressed as early as 2 h after lps treatment, and most of them were restored to the normal level after 36 h of lps treatment . similarly, all of these ten genes were up-expressed with stm infection. however, the peak of the gene expression under stm infection occurred later than that in the lps-treated group . this result indicated that the change in expression of genes during stm infection occurred later relative to that with lps treatment. the difference in gene expression between lps treatment and stm infection was consistent with the observed differences in thymocyte death and thymic atrophy between those two conditions. all of the results indicated that these biological events occurred later with stm infection than with lps stimulation.fig.  <dig> confirmation of thymic dets by qpcr. the qpcr analysis was conducted on ten genes  at  <dig> time points including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 120 h after lps challenge. statistically significant differences for multiple comparisons  were performed with bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test after one-way anova test. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> . rna-seq was performed for the thymuses collected at  <dig> time points including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h after lps challenge. the p values for transcript expression differences between different time points from rna-seq were determined using mars method. #

tlr4-fos/jun signaling pathway may mediate lps-induced thymic atrophy
ipa was performed on dets to identify the key signaling pathways triggered by lps. we found that immune-related signaling pathways, including the complement system, granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis pathway, il- <dig> signaling pathway and the acute phase response signaling pathway, were activated at  <dig> and 36 h post lps treatment. moreover, we found that cell cycle-related signaling pathways were down-regulated at 12 h post lps treatment . we further analyzed the genes involved in the acute phase response signaling and cell cycle related pathways at  <dig> and 36 h. genes, including tlr <dig>  fos, jun, il <dig>  il8l <dig>  socs <dig>  pparg, were up-expressed in the tlr4-fos/jun signaling pathway. genes, including stt3a, cdc25a, cdk1/ <dig>  ccna, ccnb, ccnd and ccne, involved in the cell cycle pathway were down-expressed. furthermore, the oxidative and calcium stress related genes of sod and calpain were up-expressed . these changes were attenuated at 72 h after lps treatment .fig.  <dig> ipa pathway enrichment analysis of dets in chick thymus after salmonella lps treatment. a up-expressed or down-expressed dets at each time point  were subjected to ipa pathway enrichment analysis separately. the top five significant pathways enriched from up-expressed or down-expressed dets at each time point are displayed separately. b merged ipa pathways in the chick thymus at  <dig> hpt are illustrated based on enrichment analysis of ipa pathways. red genes represent up-expressed genes, blue depict down-expressed genes and white symbols depict neighboring genes. the color intensity represents the average fold change



discussion
the thymus is a common target for infectious diseases without exception in mammals and birds  <cit> . in the present study, we found that stm induced acute thymic injury in newly hatched chicks, which was represented by thymocyte death and organic atrophy. previous studies also found multiple pathogens, including parasites , virus  and bacteria , could induce thymic atrophy in chickens  <cit> . therefore, thymic atrophy is a common consequence of pathogenic infection in chickens.

we found both stm and salmonella lps could induce thymocyte death and thymic atrophy. they also induced almost the same patterns of gene expression, cell death and organic atrophy, although lps acted more rapidly than stm. the maximum thymocyte death and thymic atrophy occurred at  <dig> and 36 h, respectively, with lps challenge, while they occurred at  <dig> and 72 h, respectively, following stm infection. lps has been confirmed to induce inflammation through the tlr <dig> signaling pathway . therefore, we deduced that lps may be the major contributor to the thymus injury induced by stm infection, which acts by triggering intrathymic inflammation. given the size of lps versus bacteria, the delayed thymic reaction following stm infection may be resulted from the longer time for bacteria enter the tissue and interact with tlr <dig> than single lps molecular. besides, lps treatment did not disrupt splenic cht1+ cells and cd4+/cd8+ t cell ratios in thymus and spleen tissues in chicks. the cht <dig> is an index to evaluate recent thymic export  <cit> . the maintenance of splenic cht1+ cells suggested that recent thymic export may not be disturbed at 36 h when maximum thymic atrophy occurred after lps treatment. cd4 + cd8+ dp t cells are the main subpopulations in thymus  <cit> . the maintenance of dp and sp t cell ratios indicated that the composition of cd4+/cd8+ t cell subpopulations may not be changed at 36 h after lps treatment. our results were consistent with those of a previous study in mice infected with stm  <cit> . thus, thymic dysfunction may not be inevitable with thymic injury due to pathogenic treatment.

to gain further insight into the acute chick thymic injury induced by salmonella lps, we performed transcriptome analysis of the thymus. we found that inflammatory cytokines, dna damage genes and cell cycle genes were changed after lps challenge. ipa results indicated that the acute inflammation mediated through the tlr4-fos/jun signaling pathway may play an important role in thymic atrophy. based on the present studies and those findings published by other groups , we concluded that the transcriptional factors fos/jun were activated upon lps binding to tlr <dig> protein, consequently inducing the release of inflammatory factors il8l <dig> and ccl <dig>  these inflammatory factors, including il- <dig>  il8l <dig> and ccl <dig>  could induce the inflammation and promote the oxidative and calcium stress. these reactions resulted in dna damage and cell cycle arrest, which contributed to the thymic atrophy in chicks. tlr <dig> is a specific pattern recognition receptor for lps in birds and mammals  <cit> . in mice, deficiency of tlr <dig> was shown to prevent thymocyte death and thymic atrophy when challenged by e. coli lps  <cit> . transcriptional factors fos/jun can form the ap- <dig> dimeric complex to regulate cell proliferation and death  <cit> . ap- <dig> can be activated by lps-tlr <dig> signaling and then induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including il <dig> and ccl <dig>  which contribute to inflammation by recruiting and activating leukocytes  <cit> . lps stimulation also has been shown to induce the expression of another inflammatory factor il <dig> in vivo, and overexpression of il <dig> alone could induce thymic atrophy in mice  <cit> . furthermore, inflammatory reactions can promote the production of ros  <cit> . ros alone can damage the host dna, and it also can interact with calcium signaling to induce cell death and cell cycle arrest . thus, thymic atrophy induced by stm or salmonella lps in this study was considered to be mainly or at least partially mediated through the tlr4-fos/jun signaling pathway in chicks.

we also found that some anti-inflammatory factors, including bpi, pparγ and socs <dig>  were activated after lps stimulation. bpi can inhibit formation of the lps-tlr <dig> complex through competing with lps  <cit> . pparγ can inhibit fos/jun and nf-κb by preventing their binding to target sequences  <cit> . socs <dig> can inhibit stat phosphorylation through binding of jak kinase  <cit> . thus, negative inflammation response regulators naturally can also be activated when the host is infected by pathogens in order to maintain the immune homeostasis and avoid excessive tissue injury  <cit> . in addition, we observed apoptosis mediated through the mitochondrial pathway at 72 h of lps treatment. moreover, the thymus weight was restored to the normal level at 120 h. these finding indicated that compensatory growth occurred after the acute inflammatory injury. the phenomenon of compensatory growth of the thymus after injury also has been observed in mice  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we confirmed that stm and salmonella lps could induce thymocyte death and thymic atrophy in chicks. lps could be the main factor in the thymic atrophy during a stm infection. inflammatory reactions were the factor contributing to the thymic atrophy after lps treatment in chicks. moreover, this work associated with findings published by other groups  demonstrates that this inflammatory process may be mediated through the tlr4-fos/jun signaling pathway. our results provide novel evidence for the molecular mechanism of the thymus injury induced by lps derived from stm.
