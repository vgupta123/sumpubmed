BACKGROUND
there are known susceptibility factors, environmental and genetic, associated with alcohol abuse and alcoholism. the ability to drink copious amounts of alcohol with little consequence to the individual is a primary onset symptom in many alcoholics, indicating that a low level of response to alcohol is a major vulnerability factor in the development of alcoholism  <cit> . defining neurobiological factors contributing to alcohol moderation will aid our understanding of alcohol use and abuse, and is an effective strategy for the development of improved treatments for individuals diagnosed with alcohol use disorders. use of rodent models to imitate human disease has been a powerful tool in the advancement of understanding this disease and improving treatments. there are several rodent models in place to study aspects of alcohol abuse and alcoholism, however none model alcoholism completely. the extent to which a mouse will orally self-administer ethanol solutions under similar environmental conditions depends heavily on its genetic background  <cit> . recently, we found that c57bl/6jxfvb/nj  and fvb/njxc57bl/6j  f <dig> hybrid mice self-administer unusually high levels of alcohol during two-bottle preference tests   <cit> . this new genetic model has a significant advantage when compared to existing inbred strains, including evidence of an overdominant phenotype and drinking to high blood alcohol levels  <cit> . additionally, the high ethanol consumption exhibited by bxf mice is seen in two additional ethanol drinking paradigms   <cit> . we then observed distinct alcohol self-administration behaviors when comparing two f <dig> hybrid strains of mice: c57bl/6j x nzb/b1nj  show reduced alcohol preference after experience with high concentrations of alcohol and periods of abstinence and bxf show sustained alcohol preference  <cit> . using a battery of behavioral tests, we have shown that bxn are more sensitive than bxf mice to the aversive and sedative, but not rewarding, effects of ethanol  <cit> . basic research on novel behavioral and genetic models of high alcohol consumption and experience-induced changes in drinking will further our knowledge on alcohol abuse and alcoholism. the reduced alcohol preference phenotype is interesting because bxn mice initially show a high preference for ethanol solutions. though the motivational aspect of reducing alcohol intake after experience with high ethanol concentrations and abstinence is unknown, bxn mice might be likened to moderate alcohol drinkers in that they still consume ethanol solutions but at a reduced level, presumably due to an aversive experience. the sustained alcohol preference model is also interesting, as bxf mice stably consume extremely high levels of ethanol regardless of previous experience. sustained and reduced alcohol preference can be related to an alcohol deprivation effect, a phenomenon where animals exhibit significantly increased alcohol consumption after a period of forced abstinence  <cit> . the alcohol deprivation effect is a useful phenomenon for studying increased alcohol drinking behavior. although the experimental schedule known to induce the alcohol deprivation effect is quite different than the schedule used here, comparing sustained and reduced alcohol preference to an alcohol deprivation effect relates the different behavioral phenotypes discussed here to an important phenomenon in rodent models of alcohol research. reduced alcohol preference would be the opposite of an alcohol deprivation effect and sustained alcohol preference could be described as the absence of an alcohol deprivation effect. the use of diverse genetic animal models, such as bxf and bxn, contributes greatly to the advancement of the field since alcohol use disorders are thought to arise from complex interactions between genetics and environment. identification of differential immediate early gene expression for these hybrids offers insight into the brain circuitry important for the rewarding and aversive properties of ethanol.

ethanol and other drug-engaged neurocircuits have been studied in specific rodent models using molecular markers of neuronal plasticity and/or activity  <cit> . self-administered and experimenter-administered ethanol does not result in equivalent brain metabolic maps, suggesting specific circuitry underlies the reinforcing effects of ethanol  <cit> . one key component, yet to be extensively explored in alcohol research, is examination of sustained and reduced alcohol preference behaviors and identification of neuronal circuits engaged during these behaviors. the goal of this experiment was to identify brain regions engaged by sustained and reduced alcohol preference. because chronic alcohol administration  has been shown to cause brain regional differences in Δfosb levels, we tested the hypothesis that these behavioral phenotypes are represented by differential production of the inducible transcription factor, Δfosb, in brain regions known to be involved in reward, aversion, and stress  <cit> .

chronic stimuli that cause regional differences in Δfosb levels include drugs of abuse , chronic stress , and compulsive wheel running  <cit> . as a potential mediator of long-term adaptations in the brain, identifying the dominant variant of fosb  in response to chronic ethanol treatment is an important distinction. there are several studies that measured fosb and Δfosb after chronic stimuli for which it has not been verified that Δfosb was the dominant isoform . however, there is strong evidence that Δfosb, not fosb, is the dominant isoform after chronic stimuli  <cit> . a study by ryabinin and wang  found that in low alcohol preferring dba/2j mice, four days of repeated ethanol injections resulted in robust increases in fosb expression in the following brain regions: anterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus, lateral septum ventrale, central amygdala, lateral amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens shell, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus  <cit> . their results identify an ethanol-responsive neurocircuit. fosb expression has also been measured in the high alcohol preferring c57bl/6j mouse during acquisition and maintenance of ethanol self-administration under limited access conditions. there were no changes in fosb levels during acquisition of self-administration  <cit> . however, after two weeks of limited access ethanol self-administration, fosb levels were increased in the central medial nucleus of the amygdala and edinger-westphal nucleus  <cit> . overall, reports identify novel regions engaged in ethanol self-administration, as well as implicate a role for the mesocorticolimbic pathway and extended amygdala  <cit> . however, it is important to note that changes in Δfosb levels depend on route of ethanol administration, dose, and length of time exposed to a treatment or schedule  <cit> .

the mouse strains used in this study provide interesting models for comparison of sustained and reduced alcohol preference and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these distinct alcohol responses. this study demonstrates that mice exhibiting reduced alcohol preference also show significant plasticity in reward- and stress-related circuits .

RESULTS
the effect of alcohol concentrations and abstinence periods on self-administration in bxf and bxn mice
to demonstrate that varying ethanol concentrations and/or abstinence periods changed subsequent ethanol consumption, we designed four schedules  to measure ethanol consumption . there were four experimental groups for each hybrid: high concentrations, high concentrations with abstinence periods, low concentrations, and low concentrations with abstinence periods. complete data for ethanol preference  and consumption  data  are presented for reference. to establish and illustrate the behavioral phenotypes of sustained and reduced alcohol preference, 9% ethanol preference and consumption data is presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  these behavioral phenotypes are based on comparison of 9% ethanol preference and consumption from the first, second, third, and fourth presentation in the high concentrations groups and corresponding experimental days for the low concentrations groups. a two way anova  of 9% ethanol preference and consumption was performed. for the high concentrations group, ethanol preference  and consumption  were greater for bxf than bxn, and bxf exhibited sustained alcohol preference and consumption while bxn exhibited reduced alcohol preference and consumption = <dig> , p <  <dig>   <dig>  genotype f= <dig> , p <  <dig> , time f= <dig> , p <  <dig> ; ethanol consumption - interaction n/s, genotype f= <dig> , p <  <dig> , time f= <dig> , p <  <dig> ). for the high concentrations group with abstinence, ethanol preference  and consumption  were greater for bxf than bxn, and bxf exhibited sustained alcohol preference and consumption while bxn exhibited reduced alcohol preference and consumption = <dig> , p <  <dig> , genotype f= <dig> , p <  <dig> , time f= <dig> , p <  <dig> ; ethanol consumption - interaction f= <dig> , p <  <dig> , genotype f= <dig> , p <  <dig> , time f= <dig> , p <  <dig> ). for the low concentrations group, ethanol preference  and consumption  were greater for bxf than bxn, and both hybrids exhibited sustained alcohol preference and consumption = <dig> , p <  <dig> , time n/s; ethanol consumption - interaction n/s, genotype f= <dig> , p <  <dig> , time n/s). for the low concentrations group with abstinence, ethanol preference  and consumption  were greater for bxf than bxn, and both hybrids exhibited moderate reductions in alcohol preference and consumption = <dig> , p <  <dig> , time n/s; ethanol consumption - interaction f= <dig> , p <  <dig> , genotype f= <dig> , p <  <dig> , time f= <dig> , p <  <dig> ). in summary, in high concentrations groups , bxf exhibited sustained alcohol preference while bxn exhibited reduced alcohol preference and in the low concentrations groups , both bxf and b6xn exhibited sustained alcohol preference. since the phenotypes of interest are best captured in groups without abstinence, they are the focus of the remainder of the study.

Δfosb levels
Δfosb quantification and analysis was used to identify neurocircuitry chronically activated during sustained and reduced alcohol preference. there were three experimental groups for each hybrid: high concentrations, low concentrations, and water . Δfosb data is presented as percent Δfosb positive neurons  . previous work has shown that ethanol experience can induce neurodegeneration  <cit> . therefore, we investigated neuronal numbers in this study and report no significant difference based on genotype or group for the brain regions quantified in this study. the following three analyses of Δfosb data were performed: 1) three-way anova , 2) two way anova  for each genotype, and 3) correlation matrices were developed to map correlation networks.

percent Δfosb positive neurons = /.

repeated measures three-way anova  revealed a genotype x brain region interaction , a group x brain region interaction , and a main effect of brain region . repeated measures two-way anova  for each genotype showed that there was a main effect of group and brain region for both bxf and bxn . post-hoc analysis revealed six significant group differences for bxn . percent Δfosb levels were higher in low concentrations group than in the water group in la, cec/cel, ew, and vta. percent Δfosb was higher in the high concentrations group than in the water group in cempv. percent Δfosb was higher in the low concentrations group than in the high concentrations group in ew. Δfosb data for all other brain regions quantified are presented in table  <dig>  pearson’s r correlational analysis was used to determine if % of Δfosb positive neurons in a given brain region correlated with ethanol consumption or preference. ethanol consumption and preference displayed a significant positive correlation with %Δfosb in the ew and vta of bxn mice .

the complex relationship among Δfosb expression, genotype, brain region, and ethanol consumption was further explored using principle component analysis and hierarchical clustering. principal components analysis revealed that the majority of variability  in the data was represented by  <dig> components. unsupervised hierarchical clustering  was then performed and ordered using the first principal component . the individual clustering revealed strong, but not perfect, patterns of grouping based on ethanol consumption, regardless of genotype. many of the ethanol-naïve mice clustered together and exhibited less overall Δfosb than the mean and many of the mice that displayed sustained alcohol preference clustered together and exhibited more overall Δfosb than the mean. these two clusters were the most divergent. the three clusters in between represented a greater than, less than, and mean mix of Δfosb values and ethanol drinking phenotypes.

discussion
distinct alcohol self-administration behaviors were observed when comparing two f <dig> hybrid strains of mice: bxn show reduced alcohol preference after experience with high concentrations of alcohol and periods of abstinence while bxf show sustained alcohol preference. bxf models stable, high consumption  and bxn models moderate drinking . neuronal plasticity  was different depending on ethanol experience, further supporting an underlying role of specific neuronal circuitry in sustained and reduced alcohol preference.

for the high alcohol consuming strain, c57bl/ <dig>  ethanol preference and consumption are highly dependent on initial ethanol concentration, length of abstinence, and sub-strain   <cit> . we found that the ethanol preference and consumption seen in bxf mice were consistently higher  in the four different schedules tested. the moderately high ethanol preference and consumption in bxn were only sustained with one schedule of chronic drinking , while reductions in preference and consumption were observed with all other chronic drinking schedules tested. bxn reduced alcohol preference offers a novel animal model in which experience  dramatically reduces their response to a previously highly preferred ethanol concentration.

self-administered and experimenter-administered ethanol produce different brain metabolic maps, suggesting specific circuitry underlies the reinforcing effects of ethanol  <cit> . we tested the hypothesis that the sustained and reduced alcohol preference behavioral phenotypes are represented by differential production of the inducible transcription factor, Δfosb, in brain regions known to be involved in reward, aversion, and stress. Δfosb is a transcription factor with a unique long-term stability and does not desensitize to stimuli as c-fos does, rather it accumulates during chronic treatments. increases in Δfosb are due to increased neuronal activity and are thought to reflect long-lasting neuronal plasticity. we found that the percent of Δfosb positive neurons in brain regions depends on genotype  and group .

for bxn, post-hoc analysis revealed that voluntary ethanol consumption resulted in increased Δfosb in the ew nucleus, vta, and amygdala: indicating increased neuronal plasticity in brain regions known to be involved in ethanol, reward, and stress responses. bxn mice in the high concentrations group  have reduced neuronal plasticity in the ew, suggesting that these neurons respond to alcohol intake with an experience-dependent plasticity. in the low concentrations group , neuronal plasticity in the ew is greater than in the high concentrations and water control groups. although conducted using different ethanol drinking paradigms and genetic mouse models, our findings in the ew of bxn mice agree with previous ethanol consumption studies  <cit> . the non-preganglionic ew has recently been characterized as containing perioculomotor urocortin -containing neurons  <cit> . ucn <dig> is a corticotropin releasing factor -like peptide that binds crf <dig> and crf <dig> receptors. previous studies using genetic, pharmacological, and lesion approaches have shown that ucn <dig> is involved in regulating alcohol consumption  <cit> . there is a known genetic predisposition for high alcohol intake in rodents that is correlated with higher basal levels of ucn <dig> in ew and lsi  <cit> . thus, the lack of post-hoc significance that we observed in ew for high alcohol preferring and consuming bxf mice was unexpected. perhaps this is due to the slightly elevated percent Δfosb levels in the bxf water group as compared with bxn water group. indeed, the percent Δfosb levels for all mice exhibiting sustained alcohol preference  were quite similar.

for bxn, ethanol consumption in the low concentrations group increased neuronal plasticity in the vta . ethanol preference and consumption were also greater for the low concentrations group. the lack of post-hoc significance that we observed in vta for high alcohol preferring and consuming bxf mice was unexpected and may be due to slightly higher basal levels of Δfosb in the water control group. percent Δfosb levels were slightly elevated in the bxf water group as compared with bxn water group, whereas the percent Δfosb levels were quite similar for all mice exhibiting sustained alcohol preference . the vta dopamine system plays a major role in mediating the reinforcing effects of ethanol and participates in many reciprocal connections important for ethanol and reward-related behaviors  <cit> . additionally, the vta projects to the amygdala and ew nucleus. rats have been shown to self-administer ethanol directly into the vta  <cit> . also, ethanol exposure increases the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons in vta  <cit> . increased firing rate could be linked to the Δfosb induction in the vta that we observed following chronic voluntary ethanol administration in bxn.

alcohol dependence induces long-term neuroadaptations, resulting in negative emotional states; an important mechanism in negative reinforcement is corticotropin-releasing factor  signaling within the amygdala  <cit> . pharmacological manipulations of neurons in the cea have targeted gaba, crf, opioid, serotonin, dynorphin, and norepinephrine receptors  <cit> . gaba antagonists, as well as crf antagonists, decrease ethanol consumption  <cit> . lesions of the cea decrease continuous access voluntary ethanol consumption  <cit> . our findings further support a role for cea in the regulation alcohol drinking behavior. gabaergic neurons in the central amygdala form a heterogeneous population whose connections appear related to their peptide content. these gabaergic neurons integrate output activity of the cea. as reviewed in [wee and koob , several studies have identified a role for dynorphin and kappa opioid receptors in the maintenance and escalation of ethanol intake  <cit> . more recently, walker et al has demonstrated that the κ-opioid receptor antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine, within the extended amygdala selectively reduces ethanol self-administration in dependent animals  <cit> . kappa opioid receptor signaling remains a key interest of research at the intersection of stress, reward, and aversion. it has also been demonstrated that stress-induced ethanol self-administration is mediated by kappa opioid receptor signaling  <cit> . the central cea can be subdivided into the latero-capsular  and medial posterior ventral. gabaergic neurons of the cel/cec receive dopaminergic innervations from the vta; as previously noted, these neurons are activated after acute ethanol administration and show increased Δfosb mice showing sustained alcohol preference. also, see mc[bride  for an excellent review on cea and the effects of alcohol  <cit> . in our study, bxn mice with sustained alcohol preference  exhibited increased neuronal plasticity in the cec/cel and la and bxn mice with reduced alcohol preference  exhibit increased neuronal plasticity in the cempv. these results suggest that specific ethanol experience involves plasticity in gabaergic neurons in the amygdala. with this data, along with corresponding changes in neuronal plasticity in the vta and ew, we propose this circuit undergoes significant plasticity under sustained alcohol preference conditions.

previous research has shown that c57bl/6j mice can achieve high blood alcohol levels by two bottle choice drinking, however these blood alcohol levels are not sustained and often the drinking does not meet criteria for pharmacological motivation set forth by dole and gentry   <cit> . bxn mice exhibiting reduced alcohol preference consumed less than would be expected from a typical c57bl/6j mouse  <cit> . therefore, although we did not take blood alcohol samples, it is not likely that bxn mice showing reduced alcohol preference achieved sustained pharmacologically relevant blood alcohol levels, suggesting high blood alcohol concentrations of are not necessary to induce plasticity on these brain regions. it is important to note that a highly significant effect of group also exists in bxf, even though post-hoc results  for bxf brain regions did not indicate significant changes in percent Δfosb positive neurons for any region following chronic ethanol consumption with these different schedules.

in order to visualize potential relationships among variables hierarchical clustering was performed. the heatmap of the resulting analysis shows a general trend between Δfosb levels and ethanol consumption regardless of genotype. higher Δfosb levels were associated with high drinking and lower Δfosb levels were associated with control animals; however, the strength of the relationship was not sufficient to accurately predict drinking phenotypes based solely on Δfosb levels.

CONCLUSIONS
distinct alcohol self-administration behaviors were observed with two f <dig> hybrid strains of mice: bxn show reduced alcohol preference after experience with high concentrations of alcohol while bxf show sustained alcohol preference. bxf models stable, high consumption  and bxn models moderate drinking . changes in neuronal plasticity  were experience-dependent, as well as brain region- and genotype-specific, further defining the neuronal circuitry underlies motivational aspects of ethanol consumption. these results show that the change of one parental line in hybrid mice results in changes in patterns of alcohol consumption and marked changes in patterns of Δfosb expression, suggesting that distinct brain networks are engaged in these different hybrid mice.
