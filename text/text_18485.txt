BACKGROUND
corn borers are the primary maize pest in many environments  <cit> . corn borers feeding on the pith of the stem results in yield losses because stem damage interferes with assimilate movement to developing kernels. they can also attack the ears, promoting secondary fungal infection, leading to contamination of grain with mycotoxins that may affect human and animal health  <cit> .

there are different species of borers that attack maize in different parts of the world. the most economically important species are classified into two families: crambidae and noctuidae. within the crambidae family, the species with economic importance are: ostrinia nubilalis hubner in north america, europe and north africa; ostrinia furnacalis guenée in asia; diatraea saccharalis fabricius from usa to argentina; chilo partellus swinhoe in southern usa, central america and the caribbean; diatraea lineolata walker in central america, the caribbean region and south america; and diatraea grandiosella dyar in north and central america. within the noctuidae family, the main maize borers are: sesamia nonagrioides lefebvre in the mediterranean region, busseola fusca fuller in sub-saharan africa, and sesamia calamistis hampson in west africa. this study focuses on the noctuid mediterranean corn borer  sesamia nonagroides lefebvre, the most important insect pest of maize in the mediterranean region that includes southern europe  <cit> .

the use of transgenic corn which produces bacillus thutingiensis  toxins is a good method for controlling these pests, but transgenic crops are not authorized in several european countries under any agricultural system  <cit>  and are not allowed for organic production  <cit> . in addition, recent studies have reported a reduction of efficacy of bt transgenes caused by evolved resistance of some important pests  <cit> . the stacking of several resistant genes has been proposed as one means to delay insect adaptation  <cit> . natural sources of resistance to stem borers in maize could reveal promising genes for use in either breeding or transgenic approaches to resistance.

in spain, there are three mcb generations per year and the second and subsequent generations are able of making significant damage on the stem and, secondarily, on the ear. following artificial infestation, the level of maize host resistance to stem borer is measured by the tunnel length made by the larvae in the stem as well as by a visual scale for kernel damage. these traits have a complex genetic architecture because resistance depends on the plant-insect relationship, which is influenced by environmental conditions and the developmental stage of the host plant  <cit> . the line mean heritability estimates for tunnel length under corn borer infestation ranged among studies from moderate to relatively high   <cit> , depending on the genetic background.

at present, commercial materials with high levels of native resistance to these insects are not available even though breeding for increasing maize resistance to corn borers has been conducted during the last three decades in different regions around the world. klenke et al.  <cit>  reduced tunnel length by  <dig> and 6 cm after four cycles of recurrent selection for resistance to the first and second generations of ecb, respectively. bosque-pérez et al.  <cit>  described successful results in the development of materials with resistance to s. calamistis and african sugarcane borer . sandoya et al.  <cit>  achieved a reduction of  <dig>  cm per cycle of recurrent selection for tunnel length by mcb. in addition, a negative relationship between resistance to stem borers and yield has been found  <cit>  when selection for improved yield under infestation was practiced  <cit> . in summary, classical breeding experiments have demonstrated some successful improvement in corn borer resistance, but natural levels of resistance in elite cultivars remain insufficient to manage the pest. detection of stem borer resistance qtl could enhance breeding for this trait via marker-assisted breeding or genomic selection.

genetic effects for resistance against borer attack fit an additive – dominant model, although additive effects appear to be the most important in determining resistance to tunnel length and kernel damage  <cit> . therefore, the study of genetic factors involved in maize resistance to borers can be performed using highly inbred lines.

several studies performed with segregating biparental populations have reported genomic regions containing minor and major quantitative traits loci  for resistance to stem and leaf attack by european corn borer   <cit>  or some tropical borers  <cit> . in maize, qtls for resistance to tunneling by corn borers have been detected on all chromosomes, with the most commonly detected regions occurring on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . identification of causal genes underlying the qtl for resistance in these genomic regions could help breeders to transfer the allelic variants that confer resistance from the lines that carry them to elite breeding lines that lack these resistance alleles. the identification of the causal genetic variants or markers in high ld with causal variants in diverse materials would minimize the risk of dragging other genes with negative effect on the agronomic value during the transfer process.

although conventional qtl mapping based on linkage maps of biparental populations has been an efficient approach to detect regions related to the resistance to corn borers, higher resolution is needed to detect the genes involved in the defense mechanism of the plant. genome wide association study  based on linked disequilibrium  in diverse genetic samples is a relatively new approach which offers higher resolution mapping that under optimal conditions can pinpoint causal genes underlying quantitative trait variation. exploiting advances in genotyping and sequencing technology, this approach has been successful in detecting genes associated with diseases in humans  <cit> , animals  <cit>  and different quantitative traits in plants  <cit> . in contrast to the conventional qtl mapping approach based on linkage in a biparental population, gwas is based on ld among extant lines from different populations, such that a large number of markers covering the whole genome are required  <cit> . in diverse maize samples, ld is low, therefore, many more markers are needed than in autogamous species  to adequately explore the genetic architecture of complex traits  <cit> . the low ld offers the benefit of better resolution to delineate potential causal genes within small ld blocks.

many single-nucleotide polymorphism  markers have been identified and scored on a maize diversity panel  that represents the diversity available in public breeding sector around the world  <cit> . the population has been successfully used by the maize community to perform gwas in economically important quantitative traits such as kernel composition  <cit> , hypersensitive response  <cit>  and fusarium ear rot resistance  <cit> .

to date, no gwas for insect resistance in maize has been reported, although a few gwa studies that deal with plant defense mechanisms against insect attack have been reported in other plant species  <cit> . in this study, we performed gwas to identify snps associated with resistance to mcb. gwas was done in a subset  of the maize diversity panel using the maize 50 k snp genotyping array  <cit>  plus a more recently developed set of 425 k snps found through genotyping by sequencing  <cit> .

discussion
means, heritabilities, and correlations
substantial differences among yearly means for tl made by mcb were observed across environments, with the highest values of tl observed in  <dig>  artificial infestation is used to ensure the contact of the insect with the plant, but the severity of the attack is conditioned by environmental factors that in turn influence natural infestation. the prevalence of the pest can vary greatly between and within locations  <cit> . data on the monthly samplings at different locations in pontevedra  indicate a higher rate of natural infestation in  <dig> compared with  <dig> and  <dig> in a plot adjacent to the gwas trial. in addition, the experiment was harvested earlier in  <dig> compared with  <dig> and  <dig>  limiting the time that larvae could damage the plants. therefore, differences on infestation levels and harvest time could be major causes of the observed differences in tl among years.

significant genotype × environment interaction was observed for all traits, although no g × e interaction for tl was found in previous studies under infestation with mcb  <cit> . however, g × e interaction for resistance traits was not significant, except for kr, when we made the analysis discarding data from  <dig>  therefore, the high values for tl in  <dig> could be obscuring the genotype effect. in previous studies, typically no g × e interaction for kr was found  <cit> , with some exceptions  <cit> .

the heritabilities for resistance traits ranged from low to moderate while ph and flowering time were higher as expected. the heritability for tl estimated herein is within the range  of those obtained in other works with biparental crosses under infestation with mcb or ecb  <cit> .

a significant genetic relationship was observed between tl and ph  in a panel of diverse origin. nevertheless, we did not find a single snp or linked snps associated with both traits, suggesting that it is primarily due to the polygenic background. this relationship has also been important in some previous experiments with mcb and ecb  <cit> , but negligible in others  <cit> .

a high genetic correlation coefficients between kr and flowering time  and between kr and ph were found, which suggest that late and taller genotypes will be the healthiest; but these results have to be taken with caution because infestation was made simultaneously for all genotypes placing the mcb eggs close to the ground and the higher distance between the eggs and the ear of the taller and later plants could have impeded the larval arrival to the ear. in addition, when stem tissue is more lignified at time of infestation , the preference of mcb larvae for the stem tissue compared to ear tissue could be less evident.

association analysis
there was a minimal variation in model fit of the compressed mlm among different traits because similar compression level values were observed for all traits , except for tl, which had the highest value for compression level . however, zhang et al.  <cit>  shown that this method controls the false positive rate well when the compression levels ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> 

snps located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> for tl co-localized with previously reported qtls for tl by corn borers in genome bins  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . the proportion of the phenotypic variance explained  by each snp was comparable to that explained by qtls for tl made by ecb and mcb  in biparental crosses  <cit> . no qtls for sd and kr have been previously reported in biparental crosses in the same regions where we located the significant snps, except one qtl for kr made by mcb at the bin  <dig>   <cit> . therefore, association mapping uncovers additional genomic regions involved in maize resistance to corn borers that were not detected using biparental populations.

candidate genes
we used the maize b <dig> genome v <dig>  available from the maize gdb  <cit>   to identify genes that either include or are close to the significantly associated snps. a region of approximately  <dig>  mb around the snp was checked for annotated genes putatively involved in plant response to wounding and/or damage by microbes  based on bibliographic records.

genes associated with tl made by mcb
the candidate gene adjacent to the significant snp associated to tl on chromosome  <dig> encodes a tetratricopeptide repeat  protein containing. the tpr is one of many repeat motifs that form structural domain mediating protein-protein interactions in several cellular process including translocation and degradations of proteins  <cit> . a recent study has proposed that the presence of those protein-protein interaction motifs could be acting as a modulator of the gene function and protein expression during the stress response caused by invading pathogens  <cit> . the hex <dig> gene containing the significant snp on chromosome  <dig> encodes hexokinase, a sugar sensor with numerous physiological functions within the cell including response to oxidative-stress and pathogen resistance  <cit> . a gene located on chromosome  <dig> that encodes a double clp-n motif-containing p-loop nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase superfamily protein contains a significant snp. this gene shows a weak similarity to the athsp <dig> gen in arabidopsis, that codifies for a heat shock protein required for acclimation to high temperatures, and probably could be involved in response to other stresses  <cit> . furthermore the ofp <dig>  gene is relatively close to this snp. it is known that some transcription factors from the ovate family protein interact with other transcription factor families such as nac domain protein <dig>  myb transcription factors, and knox homeodomain protein to regulate the synthesis of the three major components of secondary cell wall  in a. thaliana  <cit>  and plants with a fortified cell wall are more resistance to corn borer attack  <cit> .

the candidate gene for the other significant snp on chromosome  <dig> encodes a phospholipase a <dig>  which plays a very important role in signal transduction in plants since it is the precursor of oxylipins and jasmonated acid, two hormones which regulates defense genes against herbivores  <cit> .

a  <dig> mbp region on chromosome  <dig> contains three snps that were significantly associated with tl and were in significant ld with at least one of the other associated snps in the region . the snps at  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> ,622 bp are both located within a gene that putatively encodes for a histidine kinase, hybrid-type, ethylene sensor; five other genes encoding serine/threonine kinase receptor and receptor-like ser/thre kinases family proteins  were also physically nearby. it is well known that both kinases and rlk proteins play a central role in signaling during pathogen recognition and the subsequent activation of plant defense mechanisms  <cit> . they are also involved in wound-mediated defense response  <cit> , and maintenance of plant cell wall integrity  <cit> . polymorphisms at the proposed kinase genes could also be responsible for the qtls at bin  <dig>  detected for tl in a biparental population  <cit> . the candidate gene encoding the maize calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase  close to the three significant snps on chromosome  <dig>  could be playing an important role in the activation of defense against the attack of mcb since it has been known that the cdpk is induced by mechanical wounding by herbivore attack inducing accumulation of jasmonic acid in maize and other species  <cit> .

genes associated with sd made by mcb
a gene encoding an actin polymerizing factor  <dig>  contains the second snp at chromosome  <dig> significantly associated to sd. one of the functions of apf <dig> protein is remodeling the actin of cytoskeleton under different stimulus, including wounding and pathogen attacks  <cit> . some studies in arabidopsis indicated that the apf <dig> mediated defense signal and it is also relates with actin dynamic of cytoskeleton during the innate immune signaling  <cit> . the candidate gene for the snp significantly associated to sd on chromosome  <dig> encodes a leucine-rich receptor-like protein kinase . lrr-rlk protein family plays an important role in cell-cell signaling and other signals involving peptide in ligands. they are involved in systemic activation of protease inhibitors in response to wounding by insect feeding  <cit> . on the other hand, the significant snp located on chromosome  <dig> is within a gene encoding a protein with unknown function, and it is interesting that the snp is close to the gene nactf <dig> which encodes a nac domain protein transcription factor. as already mentioned, this gene and other transcription factor family members regulate the synthesis of secondary cell wall  <cit> . in addition, other authors have associated the nac domain proteins with response to stresses made by herbivore attack  <cit> .

genes associated with kr made by mcb
the snp on chromosome  <dig> significantly associated to kr was located nearby the cystatin <dig> gene, whose product is the corn kernel cysteine proteinase inhibitor//cysteine proteinase inhibitor i , an anti-metabolic protein synthetized and stored in the maize kernel  <cit> . the expression of some proteinase inhibitor genes are induced in response to mechanical wounding and insect damage  <cit> , and it has been shown that cysteine proteinase inhibitor interferes with the digestive process of insects  <cit> . ld is low in this region, but it is interesting that the snp significantly associated with kr was in ld with a snp positioned in the exonic region of the gene . therefore, if the association found between the snp at position  <dig> , <dig> and kr is due to the linkage between that snp and a certain undetected polymorphism in the cysteine <dig> gene, the effect of this polymorphism would be expected to be especially large because the linkage between the significant snp and snps in the cystatin <dig> gene is low, although significant.figure  <dig> 
a region of approximately  <dig> kpb in chromosome  <dig> where a snp significantly associated with borer kernel resistance  has been found. the red points represent the p-values of the snps in the region mentioned above. the orange strip indicates the location of the snp significantly associated with kr and the dark blue strips indicate genomic locations in ld  with the snp significantly associated with kr. the solid black line and the green rectangle indicate the intronic and exonic region of the cystatin <dig> gene, respectively. the snp significantly associated with kr herein is in ld with the exonic region of the cystatin <dig> gene, which encodes a maize cysteine proteinase inhibitor involved in plant resistance to insects.



another significant snp associated to kr was located close to a gene encoding a basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor family member. recent studies in other plant species have demonstrated that this family gene protein has an important role in regulating jasmonic acid response  <cit> . the third significant snp associated with kr located on chromosome  <dig> was within a gene encoding a starch branching enzyme interacting protein, whose deficiency leads to decreased digestibility of maize kernel  <cit> . no previous evidence about its involvement in resistance to insect was found, however. a gene that encodes a germin 1– <dig> protein is 106 kb downstream from this associated snp; these proteins are implicated in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses including the response to mechanical wounding and insect damage  <cit> . another significant snp located on chromosome  <dig> at position  <dig> , <dig> is within a gene that encodes a glycine rich protein , a structural protein which could be playing an important role in the fortification of plant cell wall  <cit> , also this protein is wound-inducible  <cit> . a set of plant thionin family protein precursor genes were found nearby the snp on chromosome  <dig> at position  <dig> , <dig>  this finding is particularly interesting since these proteins belong to the defensin family protein which has antibacterial, antifungal, and insecticide activities  <cit> .

the two significant snps associated to kr on chromosome  <dig> are adjacent to a gene that encodes for an ubiquitin thiolesterase. these proteins form complex systems of selective protein degradation  <cit>  and mediate the biosynthesis of plant hormone signaling such as salicylic, jasmonic, and abscisic acid and auxins  <cit> .

the candidate gene containing the significant snp associated to kr on chromosome  <dig> encodes a phytosulfokine receptor , a recognition hormone whose level of expression has been increased by pathogens elicitors  <cit> .

the candidate gene, adjacent to the significant snp located on chromosome  <dig>  encodes a polyamine oxidase  . pao plays an important role in stress tolerance by generating h2o <dig> which is a key component in signal transduction pathways leading to stress responses. in zea mays, the function of pao in wound-healing is likely due to increased lignin and suberine deposition as consequence of h2o <dig> release  <cit> . in addition, it has been described to play a role in cell wall stiffening and mediating abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . the candidate adjacent gene to the significant snp associated to kr on chromosome  <dig> encodes a catalase//l-ascorbate peroxidase, they are two major hydrogen peroxide-detoxifying enzymes whose activity is very important in the reduction of the oxidative stress caused by h2o <dig>  <cit> , and the importance of these detoxifying enzymes in resistance to insect attack has been recently reported  <cit> .

a candidate gene for the significant snp on chromosome  <dig> at position  <dig> , <dig> is adjacent to the snp that encodes a kinase associated protein phosphatase. this gene family has been proposed to regulate the response to different type of stresses including pathogens and herbivore attack  <cit> . it is interesting to note that another close gene to this snp is the ipt <dig>  gene, which is involved in the regulation of cytokinin biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . the expression of an itp gen  in transgenic plants of nicotiana plumbaginifolia decreased leaf consumption by manduca sexta  and reduced survival of myzus persicae   <cit> . although there are several reports about the importance of cytokinins in the modulation of plant defense against pathogens and insect attack, their role is not clear  <cit> .

unlike markers linked to qtls for resistance to corn borers, the snps associated with resistance in the present study could be incorporated in whole-genome predictor models in order to improve genomic selection  <cit> . marker–assisted selection has proved an useful tool for improving resistance to the european corn borer  <cit>  of segregating bi-parental populations related to the mapping populations used for qtl detection, but could be inappropriate in non-structured populations. as additive effects are the most important genetic effects for resistance traits, crossing inbreds with improved resistance will render hybrids more resistant to attack by mcb larvae.

CONCLUSIONS
we conducted a genome wide association study for resistance traits to mcb with more than 245 kb snp distributed through the whole genome. we found a set of significant snps associated to the three resistance traits to mcb attack. of which  <dig> snps were significant associated to tl,  <dig> snps were associated to sd, and  <dig> snps were associated to kr. in general, each of these snps explain a considerable proportion of the phenotypic variance . no co-localized snps were found for resistance and agronomic traits that could underlie the genetic correlations found between these traits.

twenty one candidate genes were proposed for the three resistant traits, they were either containing or adjacent  to each significantly associated snp.

most of the candidate genes proposed herein are part of the signaling pathway, others act as regulator of expression under biotic stress condition, and a few genes are encoding enzymes with antibiotic effect against insects such as the cystatin <dig> gen and the defensin proteins.

the identification of these polymorphisms associated to resistance traits to mcb attack can be useful to understand the molecular mechanisms that affect resistance and susceptibility of host plants to insect attack, in order to contribute to advance in the understanding of plant-insect interactions. nevertheless further studies are necessary to validate the candidate genes identified herein.
