BACKGROUND
nomuraea rileyi is a well-known fungal pathogen thriving in a range of obligate hosts, particularly the noctuids. it affects polyphagous species of heliothis, spodoptera, pseudoplusia, trichoplusia, plutella, and rachiplusia <cit> , and hence, can be used as a mycoinsecticide. however, the lack of reliable cost-effective protocols for mass production of this entomopathogenic fungus limits its commercialization. the present mass productions methods are not cost effective and require special growth conditions  for sporulation
 <cit> . as a result, there is a need to find an active agent for commercial production of n. rileyi. microsclerotium , with a diameter of 200– <dig> μm, is a pseudoparenchymatous aggregation of hyphae, comprising only a few cells. it is produced by many phytopathogenic fungi for persistence in the soil and decaying plant material. the structures of fungal phytopathogen, including the infective and spreading structures, help them to survive for long periods in the environment
 <cit> . ms production was successfully induced in phytopathogenic fungus
 <cit>  and entomopathogenic fungus metarhizium anisopliae <cit>  during submerged liquid culture fermentation. our laboratory successfully realized ms production by n. rileyi on liquid amended medium , which exhibited insecticidal efficacy on spodoptera litura, and thus can be used as an active agent .

the morphological events that occur during microsclerotia production have been studied extensively
 <cit> . a mature ms has been observed to exhibit three distinct layers: a pigmented rind, a thin-walled cortex, and a large central medulla
 <cit> . during the initial stages of development, the hyphae swell and aggregate. the aggregations subsequently enlarge and the pigment emerges. in the final phase, the pigment gets deposited within the cell wall. the mature microsclerotia can disperse in the environment as persistent infective propagules, affecting a broad range of herbaceous and woody hosts
 <cit> .

the potentially important genes in microsclerotia development have already been investigated. two expressed sequence tag  libraries developed from different cultures of a tomato isolate strain verticillium dahliae, were found to exhibit the most unique sequences, of which 55% had protein sequences similar to those presented in the database
 <cit> . based on the est databases, vdh <dig>  a hydrophobin gene, was confirmed to be involved in microsclerotia development
 <cit> . subsequently, using the agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation  method, the role of the gene in microsclerotia development was identified. in addition to targeted gene disruption by homologous recombination, the atmt has been successfully exploited for large-scale forward genetic screen to create insertional mutants. a gene that encodes glutamic acid-rich protein and affects microsclerotia formation and pathogenicity was identified by the atmt
 <cit> . it has been reported that the physiological and morphological differences during microsclerotia development should be, at least in part, due to numerous genes expressed at various development stages
 <cit> . transcript profiling is an important strategy for studying the expression of large genes. although est sequencing has been used for the detection of reference transcripts, it has some inherent limitations, such as low throughput, high cost, and long experimental cycle. recently, next-generation sequencing  technology has emerged for high-throughput sequence determination, which is quite economical
 <cit> . the rna-seq technology has enabled us to investigate the transcriptome for various gene expression studies without reference genome sequences
 <cit> .

in the present study, the ngs technology was used to examine the transcriptome of ms of n. rileyi. we constructed two libraries sequenced using illumina hiseq™  <dig> based on n. rileyi cultures grown in liquid am and minimal medium , which produced abundant ms and mycelium, respectively. subsequently, we analyzed the expression of  <dig>  unigenes, found the differentially expressed genes related to ms development, compared the up-regulation of the expression of unigenes in the am libraries, and validated some unigenes based on different development stages by using rt-qpcr. the two assembled and annotated transcriptome sequences provide an invaluable resource for the identification of n. rileyi involved in ms development.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and reads assembly
to comprehensively analyze the induced ms gene expression profile at different external conditions, two cdna samples were prepared from the mycelia sphere, cultured on mm, and from the developing ms, cultured on am, and then sequenced using the illumina sequencing platform. a total of  <dig> million clean sequencing reads with an average length of  <dig> bp were generated, respectively. an overview of the sequencing and assembly is outlined in table 
 <dig> the mean contigs size of the sample from mm treatment was  <dig> bp, with lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, while that of the sample from am treatment was  <dig> bp, with lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . the size distribution of the contigs is shown in additional file
1: figure s1a.

a total of  <dig>  sequences were assembled, with an average of  <dig> bp and an n <dig> of  <dig> bp . the size distribution of those sequences is shown in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  among the sequences,  <dig>  were longer than  <dig> bp,  <dig>  were longer than  <dig> bp, and  <dig> were longer than  <dig> bp .

functional annotation
all-unigenes annotation provides functional information, including protein sequence similarities, clusters of orthologous groups , gene ontology , and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway database  pathway information. for annotation, the sequences were compared with the protein databases  using blastx , and the protein functions were predicted from the annotations of the most similar proteins. the sequences were first searched using blastx against the ncbi nr database, and  <dig>  sequences  had hits that exceeded the e-value cutoff . a total of  <dig>  sequences  were identified from the swissprot database.

go analysis was conducted using blast2go software 
 <cit> . a total of  <dig> sequences was assigned at least one go term for describing the biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. interproscan output file was input into the wego software 
 <cit> , and go annotations were plotted . to further predict the genes with different expression levels , the go functional analysis was carried out on the differentially expressed genes
 <cit> . the differentially expressed genes were defined as those with false discovery rate  ≤  <dig>  and ratio of reads per kilobase per million  >  <dig>  among the differentially expressed genes, a total of  <dig> sequences was categorized into  <dig> functional groups .of these, the dominant terms were “catalytic activity”, “binding”, “cell”, “cellular process” and “metabolic process”, which indicated that these genes were enriched in the two transcriptome libraries.

the unigenes were aligned to cog database to predict and classify possible functions. a total of  <dig>  sequences was distributed to  <dig> cog categories . among the  <dig> cog categories, “general function prediction only” represented the largest group , followed by “transcription” , “carbohydrate transport and metabolism” , “amino acid transport and metabolism” , and “translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis” . the smallest group was “extracellular structures”  and “nuclear structure” .

the  <dig>  nr hits were mapped to the reference canonical pathways in kegg. in total,  <dig>  sequences were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. to identify the biological pathways that are active in different ways among the two treatments, a total of  <dig> differentially expressed sequences was assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. with significant enrichment pathways, we could discern the main biochemical and signal transduction pathways. after multiple testing corrections, we chose pathways with qvalue  ≤  <dig>  as significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes. in total,  <dig> significant enrichment pathways were detected. the enrichment pathways that were most represented were the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , metabolic pathways , and microbial metabolism in diverse environments . these annotations are valuable resource for the comparison of processes, functions, and pathways in ms research.

detection of upregulated genes related to ms development
following am and mm treatments, a total of  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were identified. among the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were induced to express during am treatment. sequence analyses revealed that out of the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig>  showed no homology with known sequences and were classified as “no hits”. among the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig>  were found to have known functions. we identified a number of unigenes that were induced during am treatment as well as expressed in the enrichment pathways, such as bifunctional p-450:nadph-p <dig> reductase , fad binding domain protein , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , heat-shock protein , sur2-type hydroxylase/desaturase , delta- <dig> desaturase isoenzyme b , acyl-coa desaturase , and nadp-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase . although these unigenes were noted to play different roles in various metabolisms, they were found to be commonly involved in oxidative stress detoxification. this indicates that oxidative stress may occur during ms development
 <cit> .

rt-qpcr validation
to confirm the results of the solexa/illumina sequencing, the following  <dig> unigenes, up- regulated or uniquely expressed following am treatment, were selected for rt- qpcr assays: superoxide dismutase , catalase , heat-shock protein , glutathione synthase , glutathione s transferase , glutathione reductase , polyketone synthase , delta- <dig> desaturase isoenzyme b , 2og-fe  oxygenase family oxidoreductase , pyruvate carboxylase , pyruvate decarboxylase , aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , aspartate-trna ligase , prolyl-trna synthase , acetoacetyl-coa synthase , and vacuolar atp synthase catalytic subunit a .

the selected unigenes showed differential expression patterns related to development periods. we found that the rt-qpcr validation of two unigenes  was not consistent with the sequencing results . subsequently, the expression of 17genes during ms development was analyzed . seven genes annotated as related to reactive oxygen species  detoxification were validated as being highly expressed during ms development . furthermore, the genes involved in central metabolism were also validated , but their expression during ms formation was found to be lower. in addition, the differential expression patterns of genes related to pigment synthesis observed using rt-qpcr was in agreement with those noted by solexa analyses .

discussion
high-throughput mrna sequencing technology is particularly suitable for gene expression profiling in non-model organisms without prior genome annotation
 <cit> . in the present study, we used ngs technology, based on the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform, obtained  <dig>  gb of coverage with  <dig> , <dig> clean sequencing reads, and identified  <dig>  all-unigenes from two libraries with a mean length of  <dig>  among them,  <dig>   unigenes were successfully annotated. among the two transcriptomes, approximately  <dig> unigenes were found to be differentially expressed. the results of the present study expand on those reported in microsclerotia studies based on est sequencing, and provide more comprehensive genetic and genomic information
 <cit> .

during the undifferentiated  stage of ms, similar to other phytopathogenic fungi, there is abundant hyphal growth, accompanied by material and energy metabolism. in the present study, numerous related genes were found to be up-regulated during this stage . furthermore, the natural byproducts of mitochondrial respiration and oxygen consumption were noted to be converted to ros, such as superoxide anion radical . this is the initial step in the formation of ros by donating a single electron to the oxygen molecule , as well as a product of important enzymes such as xanthine oxidase  and nadph oxidase
 <cit> . however, o2− radical is not highly oxidizing, and subsequently produces h2o <dig> to exert its toxic role. h2o <dig> can capture an electron from another o2− or free ferrous  and cuprous ions, forming hydroxyl radical , which is highly reactive and causes lipid peroxidation; one of the major end products of lipid peroxidation had been shown to be involved in signal transduction
 <cit> . furthermore, h2o <dig> is stable and can cross cell membrane. thus, although h2o <dig> is a harmful metabolic byproduct, it also functions as a ubiquitous intracellular messenger. different levels of h2o <dig> can induce distinct responses within a cell, especially for the proper development and proliferation of cells
 <cit> .

enzymatic defenses against o2− include sod that dismute o2− to h2o <dig> in fungi
 <cit> , and the organisms defend against h2o <dig> mainly by cat to catalytically decompose it to h2o and o <dig> <cit> . in the present study, unigene <dig>  annotated as sod, was highly expressed in the am library. in particular, the expression level increased between the development and maturation stages . an earlier study also reported a similar finding during ms development in sclerotinia sclerotiorum <cit> . in the present study, maximum consumption of o <dig> was observed at the ms initiation  period , demonstrating that o2− was continuously produced and the alteration occurred between the ud and si period. the unigenes  were highly expressed in the am library, and their expression was the highest during the si period . among the basal salts in the am culture, fe2+ was noted to promote ms biogenesis , which could catalyze the formation of oh. radicals. in the present study, the expression of unigene <dig>  was not only high in the am library, but was also relatively highest during the si period . thus, the generation of ros may play an important role in the induction of ms formation, as observed in other filamentous fungi
 <cit> . furthermore, enzymes involved in the detoxification of free radicals also appear to have important role during ms development.

generation of ros has forced many organisms to devise complex antioxidant defense, such as thioredoxin , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , and reduced glutathione . the gsh, in particular, has been shown to be the main non-enzymatic antioxidant defense, helping to maintain the reduced environment of cytosol, and can be used as a substrate to detoxify the cell from oxidant xenobiotic molecules using gsts to form oxidized glutathione 
 <cit> . gr is a ubiquitous flavor enzyme of disulfide reductase family, which catalyzes the nadph-dependent reduction of gssg to gsh. these enzymes maintain the balance of the redox couple . the expression of unigenes  of functional redox systems involved in the balance of thiol and oxydic glutathione was high in the am library, and highest during the si period .this shows the increase in the oxidative stress associated reduced thiol when the undifferentiated mycelium enters the differentiated state
 <cit> , which can combat the incremental oxidative stress during ms development. other stress regulators, such as heat-shock proteins, play important role during oxidative stress, and have well-established roles during different stress conditions in the organism and are up-regulated during stress
 <cit> . the unigene  showed prominent multiple peaks in rt-qpcr and illustrated regulatory activity under oxidative stress .

ros are not only inevitable byproducts of oxygen metabolism, but also play a role in cellular signaling, which mediates or augments the effects of growth factors, cell differentiation, and programmed cell death
 <cit> . based on the am library, the dynamic activity of ms was found to be cell differentiation during the si period , and the doses of h2o <dig> were presumed to reach a certain level  or “sub-poison” concentration
 <cit> . the levels of ros accumulated during stress condition and their subcellular source were noted to determine the expression pattern of specific genes and induction of stress responsive pathways
 <cit> . much of this response appeared to be designed to decrease energy production and biochemical processes. in this regard, the tca cycle was reported to be a significant source of reducing equivalents. the regulation of the two genes, pyc and pdc, related to pyruvate carboxylation, was low , and the induction of genes of amino acid and fatty acid metabolism was  <dig> and  <dig> folds , respectively. these findings indicate that low-level metabolism may be important to balance the generation of proton. in addition, several other genes  were also significantly down-regulated during this period .

the pigment granules were found to be deposited on the rind during nomuraea rileyi ms formation, but not during melanin production
 <cit> . an earlier study examined the biosynthetic pathway of the pigment in other fungi
 <cit> . in our transcriptome, the unigene <dig>  identified as pks, was observed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the pigment. the abundance of this gene increased significantly between the si and ms development  period , and the change in genotype was in accordance with the phenotype. it has been demonstrated that pigment production can be uncoupled from other morphological changes associated with ms development
 <cit> . two unigenes  were noted to be involved in the metabolism of lipid acid. the db gene increased significantly during the si period , indicating that the unsaturated lipid acid participates in resisting oxidative stress. similarly, the acs gene was maintained at high levels during the ud period and remained at certain expression level during other periods , implying that the gene not only takes part in lipid metabolism, but is also related to the biosynthetic pathway of the pigment
 <cit> .

in the present study, a large number of differentially expressed genes involved in ms development were found. we analyzed the expression pattern of these differentially expressed genes, particularly, their up-regulation and unique unigenes in the am libraries. these unigenes were found to primarily code for stress-responsive genes or a part of the cell machinery underlying the biogenesis of various bodies; however, numerous genes with unknown functions were also noted
 <cit> .these results indicate that oxidative stress takes place during ms differentiation, and the signaling genes should be further identified. overall, this study suggests that fungi employ various pathways and regulatory networks of genes in response to different culture conditions, and demonstrated at the genetic level that ms differentiation in n. rileyi is related to high oxidative stress.

CONCLUSIONS
using the illumina sequencing, we surveyed the two transcriptomes of n. rileyi under different culture conditions, assembled  <dig>  unigenes, annotated  <dig>  of those unigenes, and found  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes among the two libraries. our findings substantially contribute to the existing sequence resources for n. rileyi, and will certainly accelerate the research on ms development. in addition, the de novo transcriptome analysis of non-model organism without prior genome annotation has again been successfully demonstrated in this study. the genes data will provide a portfolio of candidate genes for further research on the gene expression, genomics, and functional genomics of n. rileyi.
