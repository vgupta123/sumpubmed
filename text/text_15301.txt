BACKGROUND
pax <dig> is expressed in the developing eye and brain, where it affects both progenitor cell production and neuronal differentiation  <cit> . the pax <dig> protein contains two dna binding domains, a paired domain  and a paired-type homeodomain  . the pd consists of two separate helix-turn-helix motifs, termed pai and red, which act on different target sequences  <cit> . the best characterised pax <dig> alternative splicing event, involving the insertion of a  <dig> bp exon  into the pai subdomain of the pd, results in two major pax <dig> isoforms  with different dna-binding properties. in vitro studies have shown that the pai subdomain of pax <dig> binds preferentially to a consensus sequence   <cit>  but that pai subdomain disruption in pax <dig> allows the red subdomain to bind an alternative sequence   <cit> .

pax <dig> affects early progenitor cell proliferation and later neuronal differentiation in the developing brain  <cit> . this changing role might be due at least in part to a shift in the relative concentrations of pax <dig> and pax <dig> during development but there has been no previous report of such alterations during neurogenesis in the brain in vivo. we anticipated that even relatively small changes in the pax <dig> : pax <dig> ratio might be important since stronger effects on gene activity via p6con and 5acon are observed if pax <dig> and pax <dig> are introduced into cultured cell lines at ratios of 1: <dig> or 8: <dig> than at ratios of 2: <dig>  4: <dig> or 16: <dig>  <cit> . we selected a direct method for quantification of the ratio  and carried out multiple assays so as to obtain statistically analysable data on key pax6-expressing brain tissues at a range of ages throughout neurogenesis. we found changes in the ratio similar in magnitude to those shown previously to alter target gene activity in vitro.

RESULTS
rnase protection assays were carried out on tissues dissected from wild type mouse embryos aged e <dig> -e <dig>  and quantified by densitometry . the pax <dig> : pax <dig> ratio varied throughout neurogenesis in the telencephalon, diencephalon and hindbrain, following a similar pattern in each . in the telencephalon, the ratio was about 6: <dig> early in neurogenesis, at e <dig> , but was significantly lower  at each subsequent age . in the diencephalon and hindbrain, ratios were about 8: <dig> and 10: <dig> at e <dig>  but were lower  from e <dig> -e <dig>  ; these decreases were statistically significant when data from all three age groups were combined . combining results from the telencephalon, diencephalon and hindbrain showed a significant fall in the pax <dig> : pax <dig> ratio between e <dig>  and e <dig> , from approximately 8: <dig> to 3: <dig> , with a further slight decrease at e <dig>  and e <dig>  . data on the pax <dig> : pax <dig> ratio in the eye at e <dig> -e <dig>  did not show the same trend . ratios varied from about 10: <dig> at e <dig>  to about 4: <dig> at e <dig>  but none of the differences were statistically significant. although we did not detect significant changes in the eye, it is possible that non-synchronised changes in the ratio do occur within its component pax6-expressing neural and non-neural tissues . neither pax <dig> nor pax <dig> was detected in samples from the feet.

there is evidence that pax <dig> and pax <dig> have different functions in vivo in both vertebrates  <cit>  and invertebrates  <cit> . studies of pax6- and pax6-related genes in drosophila melanogaster, ey/ toy and eyg/ toe, have shown that they promote, respectively, differentiation and proliferation of eye precursor cells  <cit> . overexpression of pax <dig> and pax <dig> can alter the expression of different sets of genes in mammals  <cit> . mammalian brain cells reduce their proliferation in response to overexpression of pax <dig> or pax <dig> and increase their neurogenesis in response to overexpression of pax <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that a reduction in the pax <dig> : pax <dig> mrna ratio from e <dig>  is involved in programming progenitor cells to initiate processes that occur later in embryogenesis. such processes are potentially numerous; they might, for example, include the transition from predominantly neurogenesis to the major phase of gliogenesis or the development of specific sets of later-generated neurones such as the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the pax <dig> : pax <dig> ratio falls in the telencephalon, diencephalon and hindbrain during neurogenesis and, moreover, the magnitude of the change is in the range that alters target gene expression in vitro  <cit> . this finding allows the possibility that changes in the relative expression levels of isoforms of a single pax <dig> gene might result in changes in the functions of this gene in mammalian brain development.
