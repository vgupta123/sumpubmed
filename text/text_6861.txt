BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of endogenous small non-coding rnas  that are 21– <dig> nt in length; they regulate gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels  <cit> . since their discovery in caenorhabditis elegans in  <dig>  <cit> , mirnas have been extensively detected in plants, animals, and some viruses through direct cloning, bioinformatic prediction, and high-throughput sequencing. in plants, mirna genes  are transcribed by rna polymerase ii to form 5′-capped, spliced and 3′-poly -tailed primary transcripts, known as primary-mirnas . pri-mirnas are folded into unique stem-loop structures that are subsequently recognized and processed by dicer-like  <dig>  enzymes of the rnase iii family using two steps: first, into smaller stem-loop structures called precursor-mirnas , and then into a double-stranded mirna/mirna* duplex, usually with  <dig> nt overhangs on the 3′ end. one of the strands, called mature mirna, is incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex , whereas the other strand is usually degraded. the incorporated mature mirna guides the risc to target mrna by base pairing, either cleaving the target with near perfect complementarity or repressing its translation with lower complementarity  <cit> .

mirnas participate in diverse plant growth and development processes, including leaf morphogenesis and polarity, floral differentiation and development, root initiation and development, vascular development, and phase transition  <cit> . in addition, various studies have demonstrated that mirnas are involved in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> .

salinity is one of the most severe and wide-ranging abiotic stresses that adversely affect plant growth and limit the yields of major crops worldwide. thus far, soil salinity has been an increasing agricultural problem. more than  <dig> million ha of the world’s land area, which account for over 6% of the land worldwide, are estimated to be affected by salinity . elucidating the mechanisms of plant responses to salinity is an important topic for genetic engineering of crops to improve salt tolerance and ultimately improve crop yield and quality. as sessile organisms, plants have developed various adaptive mechanisms to improve their resistance against salt stress. over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on revealing the complex mechanisms underlying plant tolerance to salt stress. salt tolerance is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes, which are strictly regulated at several levels under salinity conditions  <cit> . in addition to transcriptional factors, mirnas also play pivotal roles in plant responses to salt stress in many species  <cit> .

in contrast to glycophytes, halophytes can thrive in highly saline conditions and are good candidate materials to study salt adaptation mechanisms in plants. the biomass production of halophytes with seawater irrigation varies from  <dig> ton/ha to  <dig> ton/ha, which is equivalent to that of conventional crops  <cit> . thus, halophytes have been increasingly regarded as a new source of crop that can be used for saline land reclamation and biofuel precursor production. investigating mirnas in halophytes, particularly euhalophytes, will help us understand the molecular mechanisms of salt adaptation in plants. moreover, it will pave the way for further applications in breeding practices and biofuel production in marginal lands. however, research on mirnas in halophytes is relatively limited compared with that in other plant species. this gap is largely due to the lack of information on their genome or transcriptome sequences and the difficulties in genetic manipulation. thus far, only two studies identified mirnas from halophytes including thellungiela salsuginea  <cit>  and salicornia brachiata  <cit> .

salicornia europaea, a salt marsh euhalophyte belonging to chenopodiaceae, is one of the most salt-tolerant plant species worldwide  <cit> . s. europaea has been recognized as a model plant to study the molecular mechanisms of halophytes in surviving under salinity conditions. salicornia seeds contain high levels of unsaturated oils and proteins  <cit> ; hence, they are economically feasible as a feedstock farm crop for biodiesel and other energy products. moreover, they can be grown on marginal land and typically do not compete with food crops for land resources. physiological, proteomic, and transcriptome analyses have been applied to illustrate the salt tolerance mechanisms of s. europaea  <cit> . however, no investigation into s. europaea mirnas has been reported to date. taking advantage of s. europaea transcriptome data in our previous study  <cit> , we globally analyzed mirnas in s. europaea through high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis in the present study. conserved and novel mirnas of s. europaea were identified, and their targets were predicted. the expression profiles of mirnas during salt treatment and between the shoots and roots were also investigated. this study contributed in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in s. europaea. specific mirnas in s. europaea may be applied in breeding stress-tolerant plants and genetically engineering plants with improved properties, which are suitable for growing on marginal lands.

RESULTS
sequencing and data analysis
in the present study, six srna libraries were constructed from the shoots and roots of s. europaea seedlings treated with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> d . high-throughput sequencing was then performed to identify s. europaea mirnas responsive to salt stress. each library generated more than  <dig> million raw srna readouts. after removing low-quality sequences, adaptor contaminants, poly  sequences, rnas smaller than  <dig> nt, and other artifacts, we obtained about five million unique high-quality srnas from each library .table  <dig>

in our previous study, we acquired s. europaea mrna transcriptome sequences that contain  <dig>  unigenes longer than  <dig> bp and  <dig>  unigenes longer than  <dig> bp  <cit> . in the present study, we mapped these unique srna sequences to s. europaea transcriptome database by using the computational software soap   <cit> . about 3% unique srnas  perfectly matched the s. europaea mrna transcriptome sequences. thereafter, the known non-coding rnas, including rrnas, trnas, snrnas, and snornas, were annotated and removed. the remaining srna sequences were used for blastn search against the known plant mirnas in the public mirna database mirbase  <cit> . the numbers and proportion of different types of small rnas are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig>

although some srnas were abundant and appeared hundreds of thousands times in our database, the majority of srnas were only sequenced few times. for example,  <dig> , <dig>  srnas were sequenced only once in s- <dig> h , indicating that s. europaea contained a large and complex srna population. the srna singleton rate of s. europaea  is similar to that of arabidopsis thaliana , oryza sativa , and cunninghamia lanceolata   <cit> .

the majority of total srna reads ranged from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt in length, which are the typical size range for dicer-derived products  <cit> . for all six libraries,  <dig> nt srnas were the most abundant, which is consistent with the typical small rna distribution patterns in angiosperms. however, the proportion of  <dig> nt srnas dynamically changed under salinity conditions; these srnas increased during short-term salt treatment but decreased during long-term treatment . the second most abundant class was  <dig> nt in the shoots and  <dig> nt in the roots ; nevertheless, the differences in their proportions should be further clarified.figure  <dig>

identification of conserved mirnas
thus far, no s. europaea mirnas have been reported. in this study, we conducted a local blastn search using s. europaea unique srna candidates against all plant mirnas in the mirbase ; this database contains  <dig>  mirnas across  <dig> plant species  <cit> . for precursor prediction, we used the transcriptome sequences of s. europaea  <cit>  to determine inverted repeats and stem-loop structures. only sequences that perfectly matched with known plant mirna sequences or with stem-loop precursors were considered conserved mirnas. finally,  <dig> conserved mature mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified in s. europaea . the length varied from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt, and  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt mirnas were the two major size classes . notably,  <dig>  conserved mirnas started with a 5′ terminal uridine residue, a feature of mirnas recognized by the ago <dig> protein  <cit> . moreover, the number of members within the mirna family considerably differed. for example, seu-mir <dig> and seu-mir <dig> families contained  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively; in addition, many mirna families  comprised only one member. a total of  <dig> conserved mirna families contained more than one member. the members of each family are summarized in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
number of conserved mirnas in each family in

we identified  <dig> conserved mirna precursors with lengths ranging from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt. their minimal folding free energy indices  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average value of  <dig>  . these parameters are similar to those of other plant mirnas, such as a. thaliana, o. sativa, glycine max, medicago truncatula, and c. lanceolata  <cit> . only five conserved mirnas contained star sequences, and three of them  belonged to high confidence sequences according to the criterion of mirbase.

we also conducted cloning experiments to validate the pre-mirna sequences, and six of these sequences, namely, pre-mir319a, pre-mir164a, pre-mir166a, pre-mir168a, pre-mir398a, and pre-mir399d, were confirmed. three validated sequences contained only one mismatched nucleotide compared with the sequences obtained from illumina sequencing. moreover, two sequences contained less than six mismatched nucleotides and one sequence comprised more than six mismatched nucleotides. this discrepancy may be partially attributed to the sequence assembly errors during illumina sequencing . the primary, precursor sequences, and hairpin structures of s. europaea conserved mirnas predicted by mfold are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

identification of novel mirnas in s. europaea
we also identified  <dig> putative novel mirnas belonging to  <dig> families in s. europaea and named them as seu-mir <dig> to seu-mir <dig>  among these mirnas, seu-mir10a and seu-mir10b shared similar mature sequence and therefore were classified into one family . when we deposited these new mirnas to mirbase, we found seu-mir <dig> was homologous to ata-mir <dig>  a new added conserved mirna in release  <dig>  with two mismatched nucleotides. thus it was renamed seu-mir <dig>  the other novel mirnas were assigned names of seu-mir <dig> to seu-mir <dig> by mirbase, respectively . the length of mirna precursors specific to s. europaea ranged from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt, and mfeis varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average value of  <dig>  . seven mirna star sequences were identified from the six srna libraries, confirming their identity as novel mirnas. however, the star sequences for the remaining novel mirnas were not detected, which could be due to their low expression or poor stability. eighteen  mature sequences of the novel mirnas started with a 5′ terminal uridine residue. the length of s. europaea novel mirnas varied from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt, and  <dig> nt was the major class size .

most novel mirnas showed unique expression patterns. four of these mirnas, namely, seu-mir <dig> to seu-mir <dig>  were only expressed in s. europaea roots, whereas seu-mir <dig> was only detected in the shoots. thirteen novel mirnas  were uniquely expressed in salt-treated shoots or roots. furthermore, the expression levels of these novel mirnas were relatively low , which is a feature of species-specific mirnas.

for validation, the precursor sequences of  <dig> novel mirnas were cloned. three of these sequences  were identical to the sequences obtained from illumina sequencing. ten of these novel mirnas contained less than six mismatched nucleotides, and three had more than six mismatched nucleotides . this finding may be partially attributed to sequence assembly mistakes during illumina sequencing.

expression profiles of conserved and novel mirnas
to detect the effect of salinity on s. europaea mirna expression, we performed a differential expression analysis between the libraries treated and non-treated with salt. all mirnas with more than one normalized reads were analyzed by calculating fold changes and p value. mirnas with p values lower than  <dig>  and fold changes higher than  <dig> were considered significantly altered. a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas  and  <dig> novel mirnas  significantly changed in response to salt treatment in s. europaea . these mirnas were divided into five categories based on their expression patterns .figure  <dig>

mirnas after salt treatment or between the shoots and roots. a to e, heat map of differentially expressed s. europaea mirnas after salt treatment. these mirnas were divided into five categories based on their expression patterns.  mirnas down-regulated in salt-treated shoots.  mirnas down-regulated in salt-treated roots.  mirnas down-regulated in salt-treated shoots and roots.  mirnas up-regulated by salt.  mirnas dynamically regulated during salt treatment. relative expression level was calculated using log <dig>  f to h, heat map of differentially expressed s. europaea mirnas between the shoots and roots.  mirnas expressed higher in the roots than those in the shoots.  mirnas expressed higher in the shoots than those in in the roots.  mirnas distributed dynamically between the shoots and roots during salt treatment. relative expression level was calculated with log <dig>  s- <dig> h, s- <dig> h, and s- <dig> d represent the shoots treated with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> d, respectively. r- <dig> h, r- <dig> h, and r- <dig> d denote the roots treated with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> d, respectively.



the first category contained mirnas with expression levels that were down-regulated in salt-treated s. europaea shoots. specifically, mir156s/t, mir164a-5p, mir166t, mir167e, and mir168e were significantly suppressed in s- <dig> h, whereas mir396h and mir164d were suppressed in s- <dig> d. additionally, mir168c was down-regulated in s- <dig> h and s- <dig> d .

as shown in figure 3b, the second category comprised mirnas exclusively down-regulated in salt-treated s. europaea roots. the expression of mir166a-5p, mir166q, and mir169e was down-regulated in r- <dig> h, whereas that of mir156d/e/f/g and mir <dig> was down-regulated in r- <dig> d. mir18-5p, mir319a-3p, and mir5-3p were suppressed in r- <dig> h and r- <dig> d .

mirnas in the third category were down-regulated in the shoots and roots after salt treatment. mir164b, mir165a, mir166x, mir168d, mir169i, mir172d, and mir <dig> changed only after  <dig> h of salt treatment. by contrast, mir396i was repressed after  <dig> d of salt treatment. furthermore, the expression of mir393a-5p, mir399a, mir10b, mir165b, mir160a, mir398a-3p, mir6300a, mir9-3p, mir10a, and mir <dig> was down-regulated in the shoots and roots treated with salt for  <dig> h and  <dig> d .

the fourth group contained  <dig> up-regulated mirnas. the expression of mir <dig> was up-regulated in s- <dig> h, and mir159b was up-regulated in s- <dig> d. moreover, mir166u/y and mir396b were induced in r- <dig> h, whereas mir169a and mir169l were induced in r- <dig> d. the expression of mir171b, mir396c, mir2-3p, and mir8-3p was up-regulated by salt in the shoots and roots .

mirnas in the last group were dynamically regulated in response to salt stress. for example, mir394a was suppressed in the roots after  <dig> h of salt treatment and then induced in the roots but suppressed in the shoots after  <dig> d of salt treatment. the expression of mir168b, mir319b, mir395a, mir408a, mir <dig>  and mir14-3p also demonstrated similar pattern of dynamic changes in the shoots and roots during salt treatment .

we also compared the expression of mirnas between the shoots and roots. we detected  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas from  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirna families . the expression of more than half  of these mirnas was higher in the roots , whereas  <dig> mirnas were higher in the shoots . in addition, seven mirnas were dynamically distributed between the shoots and roots during salt treatment .

to confirm the expression of identified mirnas and detect their dynamic responses to salt stress, we selected five conserved mirnas  and one candidate novel mirna ; we analyzed these mirnas by using stem-loop qrt-pcr, which is a specific, sensitive, accurate, and reliable method to measure individual mirnas  <cit> . almost all tested mirnas treated with salt showed similar tendency in deep sequencing and qrt-pcr data compared with the samples not treated with salt . furthermore, these mirnas exhibited positive correlation between the two methods , indicating the reliability of the high-throughput data .figure  <dig>

target gene prediction of conserved and novel mirnas
to elucidate the functions of conserved and novel mirnas of s. europaea, we predicted putative targets by using web-based psrnatarget program with default settings   <cit> . a total of  <dig>  unigenes from s. europaea mrna transcriptome database were used as a custom target database, whereas  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mature mirnas were used as a custom mirna database. a total of  <dig> s. europaea unigene sequences were predicted as putative targets of  <dig> conserved mirna families . sixteen unigenes  were homologous to the previously confirmed or predicted targets of the same mirna families in a. thaliana and/or o. sativa . four mirna families  contained two conserved targets, whereas seven families  presented only one conserved target. most of these conserved targets  encoded essential transcription factors, and the remaining targets included abc transporter, f-box protein, proteins involved in srna biogenesis and function, and two laccases functioning in lignin biosynthesis. in addition,  <dig> putative targets of conserved mirnas were not conserved in other plant species. among these targets,  <dig>  targets exhibited no functional annotation. the annotated  <dig> genes participated in a broad spectrum of plant development and physiological processes; these genes were classified into  <dig> categories based on their molecular and biological functions . genes involved in transcriptional regulation  comprised the major category, followed by unigenes involved in metabolism , protein turnover , and signaling . in addition, many of the target genes identified were directly or indirectly involved in stress responses . the remaining categories included transporters , genes involved in cell cycle , cell structure , energy metabolism , and vesicle transport . similarly,  <dig> unigene sequences were predicted to be targets of  <dig> novel mirnas . most of these sequences  have not been functionally annotated . the functions of the remaining annotated genes were versatile, and genes involved in transcription regulation  and metabolism  accounted for the two largest proportions. the remaining categories contained comparable genes.table  <dig>

we were unable to predict the targets for  <dig> conserved and one novel mirna families because of insufficient s. europaea mrna sequences.

validation of mirna-guided cleavage of mrnas
to validate that mirnas can regulate their target mrna expression in s. europaea, we amplified the predicted target genes through rapid amplification of 5′ cdna ends . four unigene sequences were verified to be targets of four s. europaea mirnas . unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  and unigene <dig> were confirmed to be targets of seu-mir <dig>  seu-mir <dig>  seu-mir <dig>  and seu-mir <dig>  respectively. sequencing of the mir397-cleaved 5′ product of unigene <dig> revealed a precise slice between the 10th and 11th nucleotide of seu-mir <dig> from the 5′-end. a shorter or longer cleaved sequence was observed for three putative targets, including unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  and unigene <dig>  after 5′-race analysis. this finding could be attributed to secondary sirna in the 21-nt register with the cleavage site for mirnas as previously reported  <cit> . unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  and unigene <dig> encoded the proteins homologous to laccase, f-box family protein, sac3/ganp family protein, and nadph cytochrome p- <dig> reductase, respectively.figure  <dig>

discussion
the salt-responsive mirnas in s. europaea
in our previous studies, 200– <dig> mm nacl was found to be necessary for optimal growth of s. europaea  <cit> , which significantly promotes shoot growth and increases fresh weight, water content, and sodium element content of the aerial parts of the plant  <cit> . the aim of this study is to investigate the roles of mirnas with regard to the salt tolerance of s. europaea. usually, 150– <dig> mm nacl was used to identify plant salt-responsive mirnas while  <dig> mm nacl treatment has been reported in maize  <cit> , p. euphratica  <cit> , p. tomentosa  <cit> , c. intermedia  <cit> , and t. salsuginea  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> mm nacl was selected for salt treatment in order to better compare salt-responsive mirnas between s. europaea and other plants. several sets of conserved and novel mirnas in s. europaea were differentially expressed in response to salt. more than half of the significantly changed mirnas  were down-regulated under salinity conditions , which is consistent with the result in t. salsuginea  <cit>  but in contrast to that in arabidopsis  <cit> . the expressed sequence tag analyses revealed 90% to 95% identities between arabidopsis and its related halophyte thellungiella  <cit> . previous studies have shown that the coding sequences, such as sos <dig>  of many essential components of plant salt tolerance are highly conserved between thellungiella and arabidopsis, whereas the promoter region and transcription regulation of these genes differ  <cit> . as mirnas serve important functions in the regulation of gene expression, the overall up- or down-regulation trends of mirnas under salinity in s. europaea and arabidopsis may represent the different salt-responsive mechanisms in halophytes and glycophytes.

roles of mirnas in salt tolerance of s. europaea
a potential regulatory network of salt-responsive mirnas in s. europaea is proposed based on the characteristics of their targets . first, some of these mirnas target transcription factors involved in the regulation of gene expression and signal transduction, and thus, probably function in salt stress response. arabidopsis mir <dig> and its target squamosa promoter-binding protein-like  proteins are involved in phase changes, leaf trichome development, male fertility, embryonic patterning, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and plant responses to salt stress  <cit> . mir <dig> is up-regulated by salt in arabidopsis  <cit>  and c. intermedia but down-regulated in t. salsuginea and maize roots  <cit> . in the present study, seu-mir156s/t and seu-mir156d/e/f/g were suppressed in s- <dig> h and r- <dig> d, respectively . two spl proteins were predicted to be targets of seu-mir <dig> , implying that mir <dig> could play important roles in the root development of halophytes under salt conditions by regulating spl. previous studies have shown that mir <dig> can target auxin responsive factors   <cit> , and mir <dig> negatively regulates the expression of nac  transcription factors  <cit> ; both of these mirnas are involved in auxin signaling. under salinity conditions, mir <dig> is induced in t. salsuginea but repressed in o. sativa, whereas mir <dig> is down-regulated in t. salsuginea and z. mays  <cit> . in the present research, we predicted that seu-mir <dig> targeted two arf genes, seu-mir <dig> targeted one arf gene, and seu-mir <dig> targeted one nac transcription factor . all of these three mirnas were down-regulated in s. europaea after salt treatment , indicating that the release of mirna-mediated repression of auxin signaling by salt may represent an important mechanism in s. europaea. mir <dig> is up-regulated by salt in arabidopsis and rice but down-regulated in t. salsuginea  <cit> . the target gene of mir <dig> encodes nuclear factor y subunit a , which is involved in root development, flowering time, nitrogen-starvation responses, and plant responses to drought and salt stresses  <cit> . in s. europaea, seu-mir169e/i was strongly down-regulated, whereas seu-mir169a/l was up-regulated after salt treatment . nf-ya, which is the predicted target of seu-mir <dig>  was up-regulated in r- <dig> h but repressed in r- <dig> d  <cit> . this finding confirms that mir <dig> is strictly regulated by salt and may contribute to the fine-tuning of nf-ya, a critical positive regulator of salt stress tolerance in s. europaea. the other three conserved mirnas, namely, seu-mir171b and seu-mir396b/c, showed different trends in response to salt treatment between s. europaea and t. salsuginea; all of these mirnas were induced by salinity in s. europaea. two conserved scarecrow-like  and two growth response factor  proteins were predicted to be their targets. gene regulation under salt stress is mediated by multiple transcriptional cascades, in which a transcription factor gene is induced to activate or repress downstream targets important for salt resistance. these s. europaea mirnas may define several of these cascades, in which they act as crucial molecules at an upstream mode in the transcriptional regulatory networks of salt stress signal transduction; as a result, the morphological adaptation of s. europaea can be achieved under salt conditions.figure  <dig> 
potential regulatory network of salt-responsive mirnas in
s. europaea
. up- and down-regulated mirnas are highlighted in red and green, respectively. mir <dig> and mir <dig> were dynamically regulated, whereas the members of mir <dig> differentially changed. in addition, mir <dig> was only detected in s. europaea shoots treated with salt for  <dig> d.



second, some salt-responsive mirnas target genes involved in protein turnover processes. seu-mir396h/i, which targets ubiquitin-specific protease  that functions in protein degradation, was suppressed during long-term salt treatment of s. europaea. previous studies have shown that ubp <dig> is required for salt tolerance in arabidopsis by modulating na+/h+ antiporter activity and serine hydroxymethyltransferase <dig>  stability and activity  <cit> . the suppression of seu-mir396h/i by long-term salt treatment may result in increased expression of ubp; this increased expression serves pivotal functions in salt tolerance of s. europaea. in arabidopsis, mir <dig>  which targets f-box proteins and a basic-helix-loop-helix family protein, is strongly up-regulated by  <dig> mm nacl  <cit> . however, in the present study, the expression of seu-mir393a was down-regulated in the roots and shoots treated with salt for  <dig> h and  <dig> d ; this finding is consistent with t. salsuginea  <cit>  and p. tomentosa  <cit> . analysis on transgenic rice and arabidopsis plants that overexpressed osmir <dig> found that they are more sensitive to salinity and alkaline stresses  <cit> . considering our results and those of previous studies, we speculate that mir <dig> is a negative regulator of plant salt tolerance.

third, some other salt-regulated mirnas target genes encoding metabolic enzymes. one target of seu-mir396h/i encodes sucrose phosphate synthase , which plays a major role in sucrose biosynthesis. sps is activated in leaf tissues under osmotic stress in darkness, and thus may function to facilitate sucrose formation for osmoregulation  <cit> . moreover, one gene encoding  <dig>  3-biphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase  was the target of seu-mir399a . as a key enzyme involved in glycolysis, ipgam catalyzes the reversible interconversion of 3-phophoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate. in the leaves of the facultative halophyte mesembryanthemum crystallinum , ipgam is induced under saline and drought conditions  <cit> . in addition, ipgam also exhibits critical functions in stomatal movement, vegetative growth, and pollen production in arabidopsis  <cit> . the regulation of ipgam by seu-mir <dig> may contribute to the maintenance of efficient carbon flux through glycolysis/gluconeogenesis under salt conditions in s. europaea.

fourth, specific targets of salt-responsive s. europaea mirnas are related to direct responses to stresses and the downstream signaling processes. these mirnas include seu-mir <dig>  which could target glyoxal oxidase, rca <dig>  and nucleotide binding site–leucine-rich repeat -type resistance protein; these proteins are involved in stress and/or disease response. seu-mir <dig> could also target leucine-rich repeat family protein and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which are implicated in the signaling pathway.

finally, many transporters or ion channels are predicted to be targets of specifically conserved and s. europaea-specific mirnas; these mirnas may play key roles in ion homeostasis or accumulation of compatible molecules under salt conditions. a potassium efflux antiporter was the candidate target of seu-mir <dig>  which was only detected in control samples and r- <dig> d. the genes encoding putative k+ efflux transporter  from higher plants were first classified in a. thaliana. thus far, plant kea function has not been reported despite the importance of its homologs in e. coli for bacterial survival during exposure to toxic metabolites  <cit> . arabidopsis kea <dig>  is highly expressed in the leaves, stems, and flowers, but not in the roots. atkea <dig> functions as k+/h+ antiporter and can modulate monovalent cations and ph homeostasis in plant chloroplast or plastids  <cit> . therefore, seu-mir15-targeting k+ antiporter may play important roles in maintenance of na+ and k+ homeostasis in s. europaea, which is essential for plant survival under saline conditions. a nitrate transporter was predicted to be the target of seu-mir <dig>  which was only detected in s- <dig> d. nitrate is an essential nutrient required for plant growth and also acts as a signal that regulates plant development. nitrate uptake and its distribution at the whole plant level depend on the combined activity of nitrate transporters; a sodium/nitrate cotransport system has been reported in some halotolerant cyanobacteria  <cit>  and in the marine angiosperm zostera marina l.  <cit> , in which nitrate uptake is stimulated by salt stress. we speculated that specific s. europaea mirnas, such as seu-mir <dig>  are involved in regulation of nitrate transport and distribution under saline conditions, which is important for plant development under salt conditions.

potential application of s. europaea mirnas to breed stress-tolerant plants and biofuel crops suitable for marginal lands
biomass yield can be increased by manipulating mirnas that target transcription factors and other regulators that control plant growth and development. for example, the overexpression of rice mir156b  <cit>  and maize mir <dig>   <cit>  in switchgrass can increase plant biomass and starch content and improve its biofuel conversion rate. in addition, the overexpression of mir <dig> in rice, maize, and brachypodium results in morphological alterations, including increased number of branches, thus providing a favorable phenotype for improved biomass production  <cit> . in the present study, we identified many s. europaea mirnas targeting transcription factors , which could regulate plant growth and development. we surmise that manipulating these mirnas, similar to mir <dig> transgenics, can be used to promote biomass production.

plant tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses can be significantly enhanced by regulating the expression of specific mirnas. for example, the constitutive expression of mir <dig> leads to enhanced salt and drought tolerance in creeping bentgrass  <cit>  and enhanced cold tolerance in rice  <cit> . mir <dig> is up-regulated in arabidopsis by high salinity  <cit>  but repressed in p. tomentosa  <cit>  and rice inflorescence  <cit> . in s. europaea, mir319a-3p was suppressed in r- <dig> h and r- <dig> d  and the expression of mir319b was up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots . the dissimilar expression trends observed in mir <dig> in different species indicate that their targets may play varied roles in different regulatory pathways in response to salt stress. moreover, several highly abundant  <dig> nt mirnas target genes encoding nbs-lrr plant immune receptors and trigger the production of trans-acting sirnas in legumes and solanaceae  <cit> ; these findings provide novel evidence to improve plant immunity to diseases. the differentially expressed s. europaea mirnas identified in the present study  may be applied to improve plant tolerance to salt stress. several s. europaea mirnas targeted nbs-lrr resistance proteins , particularly seu-mir <dig>  which exhibits  <dig> nt length and is abundant in the six libraries. we speculate that these mirnas may be applied to breed disease-resistant plants.

the production of ethanol from lignocellulose is usually hindered by lignin, a major component of plant secondary cell wall; lignin must be removed via energy consuming and environmentally unfriendly processes. engineering plants with low lignin content or with lignin that can be easily broken down through transgenic strategies will solve this problem to some extent. on the other hand, lignin and cellulose deposition are also regulated in a compensatory mechanism. reduced cellulose synthesis can activate lignin formation and defense responses  <cit> , and a 45% reduction of lignin in transgenic p. tremuloides michx. is compensated by 15% increase in cellulose  <cit> . in plants, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are implicated in regulating lignin content  <cit> . mir <dig> is induced by salt in arabidopsis; this mirna can directly cleave lac  and ckb <dig>  transcripts  <cit> . in the present study, seu-mir397a was suppressed by salinity in s. europaea roots  but was excluded in the differentially expressed mirnas because of its low raw reads. two laccase genes were the predicted targets of seu-mir397a, and one of these genes  was validated through our 5′-race experiment . laccases  are multi-copper oxidoreductases that catalyze the last step of lignin biosynthesis  <cit>  to polymerize monolignols into a lignin polymer; this step is vital for the integrity of plant cell walls, strength of stems, and resistance against pests and pathogens. we previously found that salt can promote the development of s. europaea xylem and significantly affect genes involved in cell wall metabolism and lignin biosynthesis pathways  <cit> ; hence, the promotion of lignin biosynthesis, xylem development, and cell wall structure modification is important for salt tolerance in s. europaea. in this study, the results further demonstrated that the repression of mir397-guided cleavage of laccase may be essential to adjust s. europaea lignin content under saline conditions. this mechanism may be one of the strategies used by s. europaea to survive under high-salinity habitats. in addition to the possible implication in cell wall modification, the overexpression of mir <dig> in rice improves rice yield by increasing grain size and promoting panicle branching  <cit> , thus improving the biomass. seu-mir <dig> may be used to develop additional approaches for engineering biofuel crops with low lignin and high cellulose contents; these crops are important because they can be easily deconstructed and fermented into biofuels.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we reported the systematic analysis of mirnas in the euhalophyte s. europaea. the results revealed that specific mirnas were strictly regulated in s. europaea shoots and roots under salt conditions, and thus, may play important roles in salt tolerance by regulating downstream targets. this study provided data to the database of novel mirnas and elucidated the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in s. europaea. the findings of this study may be used for further analysis and applications in breeding practices. mirnas, including salt-responsive mirnas, in s. europaea and those that target transcription factors, nbs-lrrs, and enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis, may be genetically engineered to generate plants with high biomass and improved stress tolerance that are suitable for marginal lands. these mirnas can also be used to regulate lignin biosynthesis, thus producing energy crops with low lignin content and high cellulose that are suitable for bio-ethanol production.
