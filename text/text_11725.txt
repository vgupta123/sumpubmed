BACKGROUND
members of the wnt family of secreted proteins play crucial roles in the morphogenesis of most organ systems and regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis
 <cit> . the best characterized wnt pathway is the canonical wnt/β-catenin pathway whereby β-catenin stimulates the expression of specific target genes including the c-myc oncogene. atypical activation of the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway contributes to the genesis of a wide range of human cancers, including breast cancer
 <cit> . in the murine breast, aberrantly activated wnt signaling leads to inappropriate mammary gland development and mammary tumorigenesis
 <cit> .

in addition to embryonic development, wnt family members are common regulators of postnatal development and of homeostasis in adult tissues, including the growth and differentiation of the mammary gland
 <cit> . the first stage of mammary gland development in mice is the specification of mammary rudiments, a prenatal event which occurs around embryonic day  <dig>  the second stage of mammary development begins at around  <dig> weeks of age at the onset of puberty in response to ovarian hormones, resulting in a rapid expansion of the preexisting rudimentary ductal tree
 <cit> . branching ductal morphogenesis proceeds across the entire mammary fat pad and is completed at approximately  <dig> weeks of age. during this phase of development, the growing tips of the ducts form the highly proliferative terminal end buds , which house mammary stem cells
 <cit> . the major changes in morphology and function that are initiated at the start of pregnancy constitute a third stage in mammary gland development that is influenced and regulated by wnt signaling. development of the gland at this stage can be reduced to two principal elements: formation of extensive secondary branches of the ductal tree, and the appearance of alveolar units that constitute the secretory apparatus of the gland. pregnancy dependent hormones normally trigger both of these aspects of mammary morphogenesis, but both can also be induced prematurely by ectopic expression of wnt proteins in virgin mice
 <cit> .

secreted frizzled-related proteins  are a family of wnt antagonists which contain a cysteine-rich domain that is homologous to the wnt-binding domain of frizzled receptor proteins
 <cit> . however, sfrps do not contain a transmembrane domain and therefore are released into the extracellular compartment where they antagonize wnt signaling by binding to wnt ligands and preventing ligand-receptor interactions and signal transduction
 <cit> . loss of sfrp <dig> expression is found in multiple human cancers including breast cancer
 <cit> . when sfrp <dig> is knocked down in immortalized non-malignant mammary epithelial cells, the cells  acquire a malignant phenotype characteristically observed in metastatic breast cancer stem-like cells
 <cit> . the work described here was initiated to investigate the role of sfrp <dig> in mammary gland development and whether sfrp1−/− mice exhibit changes in mammary gland morphology and cell signaling pathways shown to be associated with sfrp <dig> loss in vitro. previously, analysis of  <dig> different non-skeletal tissues, including the mammary gland, in  <dig> or  <dig> week old mice has shown no overt morphologic differences between sfrp1+/+ and sfrp1−/− animals
 <cit> . however, considering that mammary gland development occurs around puberty, we chose to look at the morphological effects of sfrp <dig> loss beginning at this critical development stage, and at an adult stage. the significance of these studies is considerable because methylation of sfrp <dig>  has been demonstrated to be an early change in premalignant breast lesions
 <cit> .

RESULTS
sfrp1−/− mice exhibit precocious mammary gland development
to determine the effect of sfrp <dig> loss on early mammary gland development, we examined whole mount preparations of mammary glands from female virgin sfrp1+/+ and sfrp1−/−mice and compared our findings with pregnant day  <dig>  and p <dig> wt animals . differences in the mammary gland morphology could be detected between sfrp1+/+ and sfrp1−/− mice at early stages of puberty. at  <dig> weeks of age, sfrp1+/+ mammary glands exhibited a branching ductal structure typical of a virgin female with very few alveoli growing from terminal branches at the end buds of the ducts . at higher magnification, the branching ductal structures displayed a smooth surface with a 1– <dig> cell lining . in contrast, in  <dig> weeks old sfrp1−/− animals the mammary gland displayed evidence of nascent ductal side branching , and at  <dig> weeks of age a significantly more complex arborized ductal network was formed as compared to the age-matched sfrp1+/+ gland . in addition, sfrp1−/− mammary glands exhibited branching with clear lobulo-alveolar development , which normally only occurs in hormonally stimulated mid-pregnant wt mammary glands . histomorphologic evaluation of virgin glands revealed that at  <dig> weeks of age, there is only a marginal difference in the number of ducts present in sfrp1−/− animals as compared to sfrp1+/+ animals . by  <dig> weeks of age the duct profile is markedly altered in sfrp1−/− mice showing a significantly higher density of ducts with distinct alveoli present throughout the mammary gland , and with focal ductal epithelial hyperplasia. this pattern of ductal hyperplasia and precocious alveolar formation that occurs in the  <dig> week virgin sfrp1−/− mammary gland  resembles that of the wt p <dig> ductal profile . moreover, these observations persist as the sfrp1−/− mice age. while alveoli are suitably still absent in  <dig> week virgin sfrp1+/+ animals , the presence of precocious alveoli remains and even expands in  <dig> week virgin sfrp1−/− mice , with mammary gland proliferation baring resemblance to wt p <dig> mice . while mammary glands have previously been examined in sfrp1+/+ and sfrp1−/−  <dig> and  <dig> week old animals
 <cit> , the methodology of mammary gland analysis we employed revealed that there is a striking difference in morphology between geneotypes. our findings of precocious development and persistent hyperplasia of ducts/lobulo-alveolar units in sfrp1−/− mice are significant because they suggest that loss of sfrp <dig> may contribute to an increase in breast tumor susceptibility.

our results are consistent with previous studies showing that upregulation of the wnt/β-catenin pathway and activation of β-catenin in mice induces precocious lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia
 <cit> . in particular, lane et. al. demonstrated that mammary glands from wnt-10b virgin mice are more branched and have a higher density of ducts compared to non-transgenic littermates
 <cit> . this pattern of ductal hyperplasia and precocious alveolar formation has also been described in mmtv-wnt <dig> mice
 <cit> . moreover, bradbury et. al. showed that constitutive expression of wnt <dig> in the virgin mammary gland also induces structures with a morphology similar to that seen in pregnancy
 <cit> . to determine whether the mammary glands of sfrp1−/− mice have more responsive wnt/β-catenin signaling, we exploited an ex vivo tissue culture assay to survey the expression of a well known wnt/β-catenin target gene, axin <dig>  in response to wnt3a. as shown in figure
 <dig>  both in the absence and presence of the wnt3a β-catenin stimulating ligand, sfrp1−/− mice express higher levels of axin <dig> protein . taken together, our results suggest that sfrp <dig> is an essential regulator of normal mammary gland development and likely functions in part by antagonizing the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

genes involved in mammary gland morphogenesis are overexpressed early in sfrp1−/− mice
we next sought to determine whether there were changes in gene expression early in development that might help explain the excessive hyper branching phenotype observed in  <dig> week old sfrp1−/− mice. c-myc is a well characterized downstream gene of wnt/β-catenin signaling that is upregulated in response to β-catenin transcriptional activation. real-time pcr studies confirmed that c-myc mrna levels were significantly higher in the mammary gland of sfrp1−/−mice . interestingly c-myc has been shown to induce precocious mammary development and transformation when overexpressed in the mouse mammary gland
 <cit> . in addition, virgin mice overexpressing constitutively active β-catenin express abnormally high levels of c-myc mrna
 <cit> .

transforming growth factor -β is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates a variety of physiological processes and also plays a dual role during mammary gland development and tumorigenesis. we have shown that loss of sfrp <dig> expression in vitro allows mammary cells to acquire sensitivity to tgf-β signaling
 <cit> . in an initial screen of genes affected by sfrp <dig> loss in hmecs we identified several upregulated genes within the tgf-β pathway, including the tgf-β <dig> ligand
 <cit> . the real-time pcr data presented here demonstrate that sfrp <dig> loss in vivo also results in significantly increased mrna levels of tgf-β <dig> . these findings may in part explain the altered mammary gland morphogenesis observed in sfrp1−/− mice. specifically, it has been shown that tgf-β <dig>  but not tgf-β <dig> or tgf-β <dig>  is critical for lung branching in vivo
 <cit>  and synergizes with wnt to promote mammary gland branching in vitro
 <cit> .

as discussed previously, overexpression of wnt <dig>  wnt10b, and/or wnt <dig> induces mammary gland hyper branching. therefore, we wanted to establish whether these particular wnt ligands are upregulated in sfrp1−/− animals. the expression of wnt <dig> and wnt10b was unaffected by sfrp <dig> loss , however wnt <dig> mrna levels were significantly elevated in the mammary gland of sfrp1−/− mice . interestingly, wnt <dig> is expressed during the period when side-branching occurs in early to mid-pregnancy
 <cit> . brisken et. al. showed that wnt <dig> null mammary glands were deficient in early lobulo-alveolar mammary outgrowth during pregnancy, and that wnt <dig> is an effector for progesterone-induced mammary growth
 <cit> .

critical to the wnt <dig> downstream signaling for branching morphogenesis is the receptor of activated nf-κb ligand 
 <cit> . rankl was originally characterized for its role in the development, survival, and activation of osteoclasts during bone remodeling
 <cit> . subsequent studies have shown that rankl deficient mice exhibit a significant decrease in parity-induced mammary alveologenesis which results in a lactational defect
 <cit> . furthermore, transgenic overexpression of rankl or rank  alone into the murine mammary gland elicits ductal side branching, alveologenesis, and mammary hyperplasia
 <cit> . considering that sfrp <dig> has been shown to bind to and inhibit rankl mediated action
 <cit> , we sought to determine whether the expression of rankl is affected by sfrp <dig> loss. indeed, we found that mrna levels of rankl were significantly elevated in the mammary gland of sfrp1−/− mice . these data lend support to the notion that sfrp <dig> may play a role in tumor susceptibility since abrogation or accentuation of rankl signaling renders the mammary epithelium markedly resistant or susceptible to mammary tumorigenesis respectively
 <cit> . since rankl has a role in bone remodeling and loss of sfrp <dig> increases the thickness of the trabecular bones
 <cit> , it has been suggested that sfrp <dig> inhibitors may be beneficial for the treatment and/or prevention of osteoporosis. however, sfrp <dig> inhibitors may not be beneficial to women who are genetically predisposed or who have pre-malignant lesions and may put them at risk for developing breast cancer.

r-spondin  family proteins activate the canonical wnt signaling pathway by binding to the wnt co-receptor lrp <dig> leading to β-catenin-dependent gene activation
 <cit> . interestingly, the expression of rspo <dig> and other rspo family members is induced when mouse mammary tumor virus  is inserted into mammary epithelial cells, and these proteins have been associated with malignant transformation and tumorigenesis
 <cit> . loss of rspo <dig> hinders the development of the murine mammary gland leading to lack of side branching along secondary ducts
 <cit> . at  <dig> weeks of age in sfrp1-/- mice, we started observing changes in the expression of genes involved in branching morphogenesis. although we did not see rspo <dig> changes at this stage , the expression of rspo <dig> is significantly elevated . additionally enhanced side branching at  <dig> wks of age in response to sfrp <dig> loss is associated with significantly elevated expression of both rspo <dig> and rspo <dig> . these findings may partially explain how sfrp <dig> loss increases the expression of wnt <dig>  through rspo <dig> enhancement of the β-catenin-dependent activity of wnt <dig> in murine epithelial cells
 <cit> . furthermore, the expression pattern of rspo <dig> parallels that of wnt <dig> during mammary gland development which indicates that there is functional relationship between these wnt signaling proteins
 <cit> .

mammary epithelial cells derived from sfrp1−/− mice have more mammosphere initiating cells
ductal outgrowth is driven by tebs, which are believed to house a small population of cells that are essential for mammary gland development, mammary stem cells 
 <cit> . importantly, mascs are capable of regenerating all cell-lineages that comprise the murine mammary gland and support for their existence comes from cell enrichment studies using specific cell surface markers as well as mammary gland transplantation experiments
 <cit> . similar to stem cells in either the hematopoietic system or neuronal system, the self-renewal and differentiation of mascs is regulated by multiple genes and pathways. several studies have shown that wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated in several stem cell types, including in mammary stem cells. liu et. al. demonstrated that transgenic mice with activated wnt/β-catenin signaling in the mammary gland have a significantly higher stem cell-enriched population compared to wild type mice
 <cit> . additionally, the stem cell-enriched population of cultured primary mammary epithelial cells was significantly increased when cells were treated with a wnt agonist and this effect could be abrogated by the addition of a wnt pathway inhibitor
 <cit> .

stem cells and progenitor cells from the human mammary gland are able to grow in an anchorage independent manner  and have been shown to express very low levels of sfrp1
 <cit> . interestingly, the expression of sfrp <dig> is up-regulated when mammospheres are induced to differentiate
 <cit> . considering the premature branching that occurs in the sfrp1−/−murine mammary gland and that sfrp <dig> is a wnt signaling antagonist, mammosphere formation capacity was compared between mammary epithelial cells derived from sfrp1+/+ and sfrp1−/− animals. we found that loss of sfrp <dig> significantly increases the number of mammary epithelial cells capable of mammosphere formation . these data are fully consistent with previous studies showing that inhibition of sfrp <dig> increases mammosphere formation
 <cit> . although mammosphere formation is not a definitive measure of the stem cell population, the literature has shown that such a capacity is constantly associated with resolute in vivo stem cell measures
 <cit> . if sfrp <dig> loss indeed enhances stem cell number, the increase in mammosphere formation is of importance because stem cells are thought to play a key role in malignant transformation of the breast since they are more likely to accumulate mutations and pass them to progeny during their long-life span
 <cit> . therefore the potential effect of sfrp <dig> loss on stem cell number and mammosphere formation is critical to breast tumorigenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the work described herein clearly demonstrate that sfrp1−/− mice exhibit precocious mammary gland side branching with clear lobulo-alveolar development, which normally only occurs in hormonally stimulated mid-pregnant wt mammary glands. these changes may be partially explained by alterations in the expression of genes critical for mammary gland development and by an increase in the number of mammosphere forming cells. previously, it has been demonstrated that suppression of sfrp <dig> expression is an early change in human premalignant breast lesions
 <cit> . taken together, our study indicates that the sfrp <dig> gene is critical for maintaining proper mammary gland development, that reduced levels of sfrp <dig> results in hyperplastic lesions, and its loss may be a critical event in cancer initiation. therefore, caution should be exercised in the potential use of sfrp <dig> inhibitors for the treatment of osteroporosis until the effects of such inhibition on breast tumorigenesis are fully elucidated.
