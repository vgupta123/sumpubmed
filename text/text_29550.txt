BACKGROUND
iron is an important micronutrient for all living things. in plants, it is essential for photosynthesis, respiration and other metabolic processes. plants adjust their iron uptake from the soil to achieve the proper cellular iron concentrations. without enough iron, plants suffer iron deficiency chlorosis , which is among the most common and potentially severe nutritional stresses in plants  <cit> . idc is typically not due to low amounts of iron in the soil, but rather to an unusable ferric  state. too much iron is also problematic, as free iron leads to reactive oxygen species , dna damage, and other cellular stress  <cit> . therefore, iron homeostasis is tightly controlled by regulating iron uptake, transport and storage. idc is a global problem, but is especially problematic in the calcareous soils of the midwestern u.s., where the majority of u.s. soybeans are grown  <cit> . calcareous soil is identified by the presence of calcium carbonate  and a ph higher than  <dig>  which keeps iron in the ferric  state. many high yielding soybeans are susceptible to idc, which results in a yellowing of leaves due to reduced photosynthesis. symptoms vary in degree of severity, but can result in total yield loss. the recommended management for idc is growing idc-resistant soybean lines. however, resistant lines yield lower than susceptible lines in conditions that do not favor the development of idc. identifying the genetic basis of idc resistance may aid in the development of idc tolerant lines that perform well in multiple soil types.

plants have two mechanisms for acquiring iron from the soil . strategy i, which occurs in most dicots including soybean, functions through the induction of the fe-deficiency induced transcription factor  in the root, which regulates ferric-chelate reductase  and iron-regulated transporter  . while these genes are activated in the root, it is believed that the signal activating these genes comes from an unknown factor that originates in the leaves  <cit> . hormones are obvious candidates for controlling signaling from the shoot to the root. garcia et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the hormones ethylene and nitric oxide act early in response to idc in the roots and are necessary for the induction of iron uptake genes. thus far, the study of ethylene and nitric oxide function has been limited to the roots. examining the gene expression in multiple tissues during idc response may allow for the construction of a complete signaling pathway.

in the early 1970’s, near isogenic soybean lines , clark  and isoclark, were developed that differ in their responses to iron stress  <cit> . the cultivar clark  is iron efficient and does not develop idc symptoms in iron-limiting conditions. isoclark is susceptible to iron stress and develops interveinal chlorosis in response to iron limitation. gene expression comparisons between clark and isoclark, which share 98% genetic identity, have allowed the identification of hundreds of genes involved in iron stress responses in soybean. in the last several years, microarray analyses, rna-seq, introgression and association mapping, sub-nil development and virus-induced gene silencing  have been used to identify and characterize soybean genes that are differentially expressed during iron stress and iron stress recovery . however, the early signaling events in the iron efficiency stress response remain elusive. therefore, the work presented here aims to capture early transcriptional responses to iron stress in the iron efficient line clark. we have used rna-seq to measure transcriptional responses one and six hours after iron stress. the differentially expressed genes  and signaling components identified here represent new targets for soybean improvement.

RESULTS
rna-seq reveals a dynamic change in gene expression in response to idc
in order to identify early responses to iron stress, we quantified expression of genes at one and six hours post iron stress in leaves and roots of the iron efficient line clark. while other studies have used both clark and isoclark, previous work  <cit>  has demonstrated that isoclark is iron inefficient and does not induce expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis in response to iron stress. therefore, we limited our study to clark. to induce iron stress, the roots of plants grown in iron-sufficient 3•9h2o) conditions for sixteen days were rinsed in distilled water and then plants were transferred into either iron-sufficient 3•9h2o) or iron-deficient 3•9h2o) conditions. two replicates of root and 1st trifoliate leaf tissues were collected at one and six hours after transfer to sufficient or insufficient conditions for a total of eight sample types. following rna isolation, samples were sent to the national center for genomic research for single-end rna sequencing on an illumina genome analyzer ii with a read length of 36 bp. following the bioinformatic pipeline detailed in the materials and methods, a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads  were mapped to the soybean genome . the illumina reads generated by this study were deposited in the national center for biotechnology short read archive .

to identify genes differentially expressed in response to iron stress in each sample, we used the edger  <cit>  statistical package comparing deficient and sufficient replicates at a given time point and tissue. most rna-seq analysis tools provide a list of degs and report average expression across replicates. however, one bad replicate can extremely bias which genes are identified as differentially expressed and the level and direction of expression. therefore, it is important to use statistical packages that report expression of all replicates and use visualization tools of raw and normalized data to verify biological and technical reproducibility of replicates. this step is particularly important in experiments such as ours, where only two replicates were used. we used the package ggplot <dig>  to compare normalized gene expression in replicate data sets. in addition, ggplot <dig> was used to create porcupine plots  <cit>  of significantly differentially expressed genes at multiple false discovery rates   relative to the expression of all genes. the porcupine plots use lines to connect replicate data points, allowing visual identification of any problematic data. following these analyses, genes were considered significant if they had a fold change >  <dig>   and a false discovery rate  < <dig> . the degs were annotated using the soybase genome annotation report page , which provided uniref <dig>  <cit>  hit information, best a. thaliana homologs and gene ontology information inferred from a. thaliana . the degs and their annotations are provided for each tissue and time point .figure  <dig>

we identified  <dig> and  <dig> degs in response to iron stress in one hour and six hour leaves, respectively, and  <dig> and  <dig> degs were identified in one hour and six hour roots . surprisingly, there was little overlap in the degs identified within the same tissue at different time points or across tissues at the same time point. only seven genes were in common between one and six hour leaves, and another four genes were in common between one and six hour roots . for nine of these eleven genes, the direction of expression changed between the one hour and six hour time points. similarly, only eleven genes were in common between roots and leaves, regardless of time point. the small degree of overlap in degs across sample types accompanied by large changes in expression levels between time points suggests dynamic and distinct responses to iron stress occur in leaves and roots.

to develop an understanding of which genes were affected by iron stress, we began focusing on the top ten induced and repressed genes in each sample, paying particular attention to those genes with homology to arabidopsis genes with known roles in nutrient stress responses, growth and signaling . in one hour leaves, iron deficiency led to decreased expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> degs. the seven genes induced by iron deficiency included homologs of previously described arabidopsis genes atplp <dig> , atgasa <dig> , atsweet <dig> , two homologs of atoxs <dig>  and a copper amine oxidase  . atplp <dig> is patatin-related phospholipase that is differentially expressed in response to phosphate stress  <cit> . atgasa <dig>  is a gibberellic acid-regulated protein and expressed in rosettes  <cit> . atsweet <dig> is a sucrose transporter involved in phloem loading that transfers sucrose from the leaves to nonphotosynthetic tissues elsewhere in the plant  <cit> . overexpression of atoxs <dig> in arabidopsis resulted in greater tolerance to heavy metals and oxidative stress. copper amine oxidase is upregulated in response to wounding in chickpea  <cit>  and in response to nematode infection but not wounding, in arabidopsis  <cit> . the top ten genes repressed by iron deficiency included two homologs of atnia <dig>  and a homolog of atdxr . atnia is required for nitric oxide  production  <cit> . no acts an important signaling molecule for a variety of abiotic stresses including iron deficiency and drought  <cit> . atdxr is localized to the chloroplast and catalyzes the first committed step of isoprenoid biosynthesis leading to the production of chlorophyll, carotenoids, aba, brassinosteroids, cytokinins and gibberellins  <cit> .table  <dig>

in one hour roots,  <dig> of the  <dig> degs were induced in response to iron stress. the top ten induced genes included two homologs of atrci <dig> , two homologs of atbg <dig> , and three homologs of net1d . atrci <dig>  is a peroxidase that is involved in salt-tolerance, dehydration and potassium deficiency signaling  <cit> . bg <dig> responds to a variety of biotic stresses in arabidopsis  <cit> . net1d is an actin-binding protein highly expressed in the stele and conducting tissues of the roots  <cit> . genes repressed by iron deficiency included a homolog of 2og-fe-dependent oxygenase superfamily protein  and atmyb <dig> . 2og-fe-dependent oxygenase family members are involved in hormone synthesis in plants, particularly ethylene synthesis  <cit> . atmyb <dig> responds to salinity stress in arabidopsis roots  <cit> .

six hours after plants were transferred from iron sufficient to iron deficient media, iron deficiency induced the expression of  <dig> genes in leaves but repressed the expression of  <dig>  induced genes included a homolog of atrd <dig> , wnk <dig>  and two homologs of asn1/atdin <dig> . arabidopsis atrd <dig> is responsive to abscisic acid, water and salt stress  <cit> . the rice homolog of wnk <dig> , oswnk <dig>  has a suspected role in abiotic stress tolerance and is involved in circadian rhythm  <cit> . the wheat homolog of asparagine synthetase taasn <dig> has been shown to be upregulated in roots in response to salt, drought and aba stress  <cit> . the top ten genes repressed by iron deficiency included three homologs of atexo . the extracellular exo protein is essential for cell expansion and promotes shoot and root growth  <cit> . atexo mutants have altered expression of sugar-responsive genes and increased aba levels. it is interesting to note that eight exo and exo-like  homologs were differentially expressed in response to iron stress at this time point.

in six hour roots,  <dig> genes were upregulated in response to iron deficient conditions while  <dig> genes were downregulated. the top ten genes induced in response to iron deficiency included a homolog of a wound-responsive family member , atomt <dig> , atbor <dig> , ataco <dig>  and zip <dig> . atomt <dig> is involved in lignin formation and the biosynthesis of sinapate esters  <cit> . atbor <dig>  overexpression in rice increased tolerance to excess boron  <cit> . trafficking of atbor <dig> to the outer polar domain defines the root-soil interface  <cit> . ataco <dig>  is an ethylene biosynthetic gene  <cit> . atzip <dig> functions as a zinc transporter, and is upregulated in atirt <dig> knockouts  <cit> . interestingly, irt <dig> and irt <dig> are both zip family members. atzip <dig> appears to function in both iron and zinc homeostasis. of the top ten genes repressed by iron stress in six hour roots, only one has an identified homolog in arabidopsis, the function of which was unknown.

degs located within introgressed regions associated with iron inefficiency
recently, introgression mapping was used to identify regions introgressed from the iron inefficient donor parent t <dig> to the iron efficient line clark to develop isoclark . collectively, severin et al.  <cit>  and stec et al.
 <cit>  identified introgressed regions on soybean chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of isoclark. several studies have identified quantitative trait loci  for iron deficiency in soybean . however, only the studies by mamidi et al.  <cit>  and lin et al.  <cit>  identified qtl on the same chromosomes as the introgressed regions. by comparing the sequences of the molecular markers used in these studies to the introgressed regions, only the qtl identified on chromosome  <dig>  corresponded to an introgressed region . five degs corresponded to the region on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . in six hour leaves we identified a s-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases superfamily protein . from one hour roots we identified a βhlh <dig> homolog , an ethylene responsive binding factor  and a disease resistance-responsive protein . glyma03g <dig> was recently identified as one of  <dig> candidate genes underlying the idc qtl on soybean chromosome  <dig> by peiffer et al.  <cit> . from six hour roots we identified a differentially expressed ethylene response factor .

it is important to note that complex traits, such as idc, can be the result of a number of small genes with minor effects. therefore, it is worth noting the degs located within introgressed regions but not associated with a qtl. in six hour leaves, we identified a cell division control  <dig> ortholog  and a sucrose–proton symporter . in roots at one hour, there were six degs of interest from introgressed regions including homologs of growth regulating factor  <dig> , expansin a <dig> , late embryogenesis abundant protein , flavin-binding monooxygenase protein , and a glycosyl hydrolase . in six hour roots, we identified a homolog of rna-binding family protein .

plant pathways responding to iron stress
while these analyses identified several genes of interest, they do not highlight the major plant pathways that respond to iron deficiency. therefore, we used the ontologizer  <dig>  software  <cit>  to identify go terms significantly  overrepresented within our degs, relative to all genes in the soybean genome . in leaves, we identified twenty-eight significantly overrepresented gene ontology biological process  terms. however, many of the degs were associated with multiple go terms. therefore, any significantly overrepresented go terms whose genes completely overlapped were mapped to the largest significantly overrepresented go term. in leaves, the twenty-eight original bp go terms, were reduced to fourteen. similarly, the  <dig> significantly overrepresented bp go terms identified in roots were reduced to fifteen . the fourteen significantly overrepresented bp go terms identified in leaves included wax biosynthesis and metabolism , defense response to bacterium , and cellular response to sucrose starvation, mannitol and sorbitol . when gene expression patterns are compared within these go terms across time points , we see opposing expression patterns. for the go terms dna methylation and dna unwinding involved in replication, gene expression is induced at one hour by iron deficiency, but repressed by six hours. for all other go terms, we see the opposite expression pattern. further, more significant expression changes, induced and repressed, are seen at the six hour time point.table  <dig>

to determine gene ontology terms overrepresented among differentially expressed genes in leaves or roots, ontologizer  <dig>  software  <cit>  was used with parent–child-union analysis and westfall-young-single-step multiple testing correction, with a resampling of  <dig> replicates. go terms were combined when glyma ids overlapped entirely between two or more terms. the term containing the largest number of genes is in bold, with its corresponding p-value reported.

the fifteen significantly overrepresented bp go terms identified in roots included response to oxidative stress and other stress , zinc ion transmembrane transport , response to ethylene and other stimuli , cellular response to starvation , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and metabolism , immune system process  and steroid biosynthesis and metabolism  . comparing gene expression within these go terms at one hour and six hour roots, again the most striking observation is the direction of expression changes . while most leaf degs were repressed at one hour in response to iron deficiency, most root degs are induced at one hour in response to deficiency. by six hours, the expression pattern has begun to reverse. it is also worth noting the overrepresented molecular function terms identified in roots included zinc ion transmembrane transporter activity , suggesting metal ion transport has been activated in the root. in addition, protein homodimerization activity , regulatory region nucleic acid binding  and identical protein binding  suggest a strong signaling component in root responses to idc.figure  <dig>

when we compared our lists of degs to known iron homeostasis genes in a. thaliana
 <cit> , many were found differentially expressed in both leaves and roots . this serves as both a control of our hydroponic iron conditions and demonstrates how quickly soybean responds to reduced iron by increasing gene expression for iron uptake and mobilization throughout the plant. while few of these genes exhibit large fold changes , their function and the short response time is noteworthy. in one hour leaves, a homolog of the atfit <dig> transcription factor  and a homolog of the phosphate transporter pht3; <dig> , were repressed by iron deficiency. by six hours, there were equal numbers of genes with homology to known iron homeostasis genes in leaves that were induced or repressed by iron deficiency. the induced genes included an ortholog of the iron transporter atnramp <dig>  and two atbts homologs, glyma09g <dig> and glyma07g <dig> . only one of the four fit <dig> homologs was induced , while a homolog of yellow stripe-like <dig>  was repressed . in roots, the response seems to initially favor an increase in transcription, and then as the iron stress persists, transport molecules such as irt <dig> and vit <dig> are upregulated, presumably to scavenge as much iron as possible to restore/maintain homeostasis. in one hour roots, all but one of the differentially expressed iron homeostasis genes identified were induced by iron deficiency. these included a homolog of the transcription factors atfit <dig> , an ortholog of the transcription factor atbhlh <dig> , ferric reduction oxidases atfro <dig>  and atfro <dig> , nicotianamine synthase atnas <dig>  and the iron transporter atvit <dig> . glyma03g <dig> was recently identified as a candidate gene underlying the idc qtl on soybean chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . in six hour roots, the homologs of the transporters atirt <dig>  and an ortholog of atnas <dig>  were induced by iron deficiency, while homologs of atvit <dig> were repressed .table  <dig>

sequences of a. thaliana proteins identified as involved in iron homeostasis in arabidopsis by kobayashi and nishizawa  <cit>  were downloaded from the arabidopsis information resource . blastp  was used to compare the protein sequence of degs identified in this study against the known a. thaliana iron homeostasis gene protein sequences. homologous iron homeostasis genes are shown in table, divided by time and tissue. a positive fold change indicates induction in response to iron deficiency while a negative fold change indicates repression due to iron stress. aorthology between arabidopsis and soybean proteins were verified by reciprocal best blastp.



identification of iron responsive gene families
in order to identify gene families responding to iron stress that may not have been identified in the previous analyses, we used blastp   <cit>  and single linkage clustering  <cit>  to group all differentially expressed genes. using this approach, we identified  <dig> gene families containing  <dig> to  <dig> unique sequences . eleven gene families were identified with ten or more sequences . the majority of these gene families had largely tissue-specific expression patterns and reflected the tissues in which the largest number of degs were identified . groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were largely specific to six hour leaves and had homology to gdsl lipases, protein kinases, cytochrome p450s and xyloglucan endotransglucosylases, respectively. groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were largely specific to one hour roots and had homology to casparian strip membrane proteins, ap2/erf transcription factors, peroxidases, 2-oxoglutarate  and fe-dependent oxygenases, nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat resistance gene homologs and dirigent-like proteins, respectively.

identification of transcription factors responding to iron stress
the reversals in gene expression found between the one and six hour time points in each tissue and the overrepresentation of go category “regulatory region nucleic acid binding”  suggested that transcription factors play a key role in the iron deficiency stress response. therefore, we took advantage of the soydb transcription factor database  <cit> , http://casp.rnet.missouri.edu/soydb/) to identify transcription factors within our degs . in one hour leaves, we identified two differentially expressed transcription factors, glyma09g <dig> and glyma17g <dig>  both significantly repressed by iron deficiency . after six hours of iron deficiency, only glyma17g <dig> was still significantly differentially expressed, however it was induced by iron deficiency . glyma09g <dig> and glyma17g <dig>  encode a β-helix-loop-helix and myb/hd-like transcription factors, respectively. their best homologs in arabidopsis, identified by reciprocal blastp  <cit> , have no known function.figure  <dig> 
expression patterns of transcription factors significantly  differentially expressed between iron sufficient and deficient conditions. transcription factor families on the y-axis refer to the soydb transcription factor database  <cit>  as described in the methods. absolute fold change in gene expression is plotted on the x-axis. multiple differentially expressed transcription factors per family are plotted. additional details on tf expression are provided in additional file 7: table s <dig> 



in six hour leaves, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed transcription factors . these included representatives from the ap2-erebp , aux-iaa-arf , β-helix-loop-helix , bzip , c2c <dig>  co-like , c2c <dig>  dof , ccaat , fha , gras , homeodomain/homeobox , myb/hd-like , nac , platz , tpr  and wrky  transcription factor families. several of these have functions associated with defense or abiotic stress responses in arabidopsis. glyma06g <dig> and glyma08g <dig>  are homologs of the ap2-erebp transcription factor atdreb2c   which is induced by iron deficiency. atdreb2c interacts with the bzip transcription factor abf <dig> to regulate aba responsive gene expression  <cit> . glyma16g <dig> encodes a nac transcription factor induced in response to iron deficiency . glyma16g <dig> is homologous to atntl <dig> , which regulates osmotic stress signaling  <cit> . glyma02g <dig> encodes a myb transcription factor related to atmyb <dig>  which negatively regulates sos induction during salt stress  <cit> .

in one hour roots, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed transcription factors . these included representative members from eight different families such as ap2-erebp , as <dig> , β-helix-loop-helix , homeodomain/homeobox , myb/hd-like , nac , phd , platz , tpr , and tub . of the  <dig> ap2-erebp proteins expressed, five are homologs of erf <dig> . erf <dig> has been shown to regulate abiotic stress responses in arabidopsis  <cit> . glyma13g <dig> encodes an erf <dig> homolog , which functions as a repressor in ethylene, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid pathways  <cit> . glyma03g <dig> encodes a homolog of the β-helix-loop-helix transcription factor βhlh <dig> . this gene is upregulated under soybean iron stress conditions, and is thought to function as a binding partner for fit  <cit> . glyma16g <dig> is most similar to atntl <dig> , which is a plant-specific nac that is phosphorylated by snrk <dig>  in drought-resistance  <cit> . the phd family member, glyma20g <dig>  is upregulated 6-fold in response to iron deficiency and is most similar to atxlg <dig> , a gtp-binding protein that has been implicated in resistance to pseudomonas syringae
 <cit> .

in six hour roots, we identified four differentially expressed transcription factors. two were upregulated in response to iron stress, glyma03g <dig> and glyma01g <dig> , and two downregulated, glyma18g <dig> and glyma08g <dig>  . only glyma03g <dig> was also significantly expressed at one hour, downregulated - <dig>  fold at that time. glyma03g <dig> encodes an ap2-erebp transcription factor  homologous to aterf <dig>  glyma01g <dig> encodes a myc <dig> homolog , which is activated by the jasmonic acid signaling pathway to negatively regulate ja-mediated stress responses  <cit> . glyma18g <dig> and glyma08g <dig> each encode homologs of the atwrky <dig> transcription factor . atwrky <dig> has been implicated in senescence and defense  <cit> , phosphate stress  <cit>  and boron deficiency  <cit> .

in addition to identifying individual transcription factors within each sample, we used overrepresentation analysis to identify transcription factor families significantly overrepresented among degs relative to their abundance in the soybean genome. only the ap2-ereb transcription factor family was identified as significantly overrepresented  and only in one hour roots.

identification of transcription factor binding sites overrepresented in iron-responsive genes
transcriptional cascades happen quickly, and to explore pathway components outside of our one and six hour windows, we examined the transcription factor binding sites that were overrepresented in the promoters of our degs. we leveraged clover   <cit>  and the transfac transcription factor database  to identify transcription factor binding sites significantly  overrepresented in promoters of degs relative to promoters of all predicted genes in the soybean genome.

we found  <dig> unique transcription factor motifs significantly overrepresented across the four tissue/time points within the degs. focusing on transcription factors known to be involved in abiotic and biotic stress response, arf, bzr <dig>  dreb1b, hy <dig>  mybph <dig>  tga <dig>  and trab <dig> binding sites were all significantly overrepresented  in promoters of genes differentially expressed in one hour leaves . arf  has been implicated in both biotic and abiotic stress responses in several plant systems  <cit> . in our dataset, its binding site is present in a high percentage of deg promoters . bzr <dig> is a central regulator of brassinosteroid  signaling, synthesis and growth responses  <cit> . soybean gmdreba and gmdrebb are induced by cold, drought and salt in the leaves of seedlings. while expression of gmdrebc is low in leaves, it has high levels of expression in roots following drought, salt and aba treatments  <cit> . hy <dig>  is a bzip transcription factor that has been shown to positively regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . the mybph <dig> transcription factor functions in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in petunia  <cit>  and may also be involved in salt and cold-tolerance in pea  <cit> . tga <dig> is controlled by nitric oxide and regulates systemic acquired resistance in plants through salicylic acid –mediated signal transduction pathway  <cit> . trab <dig>  responsible for aba regulation, is phosphorylated in response to osmotic stress and by the snrk <dig> kinase in response to aba  <cit> .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
a complicated molecular network exists to maintain iron homeostasis, as metals are necessary for many metabolic processes yet toxic to cells in high concentrations. the mechanisms for sensing deficiencies and interactions with general stress and defense pathways are poorly understood. previous work demonstrated that iron deficiency is sensed in the leaves and that an unknown leaf signal regulates the expression of iron uptake genes in the root  <cit> . in order to capture signaling between the root and shoot, and to identify genes acting early in efficient responses, we sampled leaves and roots from the same plants, one and six hours after the onset of iron stress. one of our first observations was the dynamic difference between roots and shoots. at one hour of iron stress, few genes were differentially expressed in leaves but many were already changing expression in roots. by six hours, more genes were differentially expressed in the leaves, and a massive shift was seen in the direction of gene expression in both roots and shoots. further, there was little overlap in the degs found in each tissue and time point.

stein and waters  <cit>  and waters et al.  <cit>  used the arabidopsis genome array to measure gene expression in roots and rosettes  of the same plants  <dig> and 48 hours after iron deficiency using two different arabidopsis ecotypes, differing in the speed of their iron deficiency response time  <cit> . in the faster kas- <dig> ecotype, greater differential gene expression was observed in roots  than rosettes . in the slower tsu- <dig> ecotype, the number of degs was approximately equal between roots and rosettes . in the faster kas- <dig>  40% and 31% of degs were expressed in both time points in roots and rosettes, respectively. in contrast, only 16% and 10% of degs from tsu- <dig> roots and rosettes were common to both time points. another interesting difference between ecotypes was that only kas- <dig> root degs were significantly overrepresented with abiotic and biotic stress associated go terms. in contrast, only tsu- <dig> rosettes were overrepresented with abiotic and biotic stress go terms. in our study, approximately equal numbers of degs were identified in roots and leaves, with very little overlap in time points, mirroring tsu- <dig> responses  <cit> . in our experiment however, we found most go terms associated with abiotic stress significantly overrepresented in the root, mirroring kas- <dig>  another interesting difference is that stein and waters  <cit>  found that fro <dig> expression in kas- <dig> significantly increased 16 hours after iron deficiency treatment, while fro <dig> expression in tsu- <dig> was significant only after 48 hours. in our study, we found that soybean homologs of fit and fro <dig> were induced by iron deficiency in both one and six hour roots suggesting clark may have a faster iron efficiency response than either of the arabidopsis ecotypes. differences in the timing of fro <dig> expression could also be due to different experimental protocols. while our study reduced available iron under hydroponic conditions, stein and waters  <cit>  removed iron from the growing media completely.

to our knowledge, no other gene expression analyses have been performed on the early stages of iron deficiency examining root and shoot response simultaneously. therefore, we expanded our comparisons to other iron deficiency experiments focused on single tissues. buckhout et al.  <cit>  grew arabidopsis ecotype landsberg erecta in fe-sufficient hydroponic conditions, moved them into fe-free media and collected roots  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and 24 hours later. at one hour, they identified  <dig> deg . by six hours,  <dig> degs  were found. similar to our study, very little overlap in gene expression was found between time points. however, we found greater differential gene expression in one hour roots, with  <dig> of  <dig> degs induced by iron deficiency. yang et al.  <cit>  grew two arabidopsis accessions  on agar media, switched to fe-deficient agar and collected roots three days later for microarray analysis. their goal was to identify core iron-stress response genes in arabidopsis and categorize them into functional modules. they identified  <dig> and  <dig> genes upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in response to iron deficiency. all but one gene overlapped with the iron-stress responsive genes found in the buckhout study  <cit> .

we also examined studies done in response to other nutrient deficiencies. hermans et al.  <cit>  looked at the effect of magnesium stress on arabidopsis roots and mature leaves  <dig>   <dig> and 28 hours after the removal of magnesium from the media. in four-hour roots,  <dig> of the  <dig> degs were induced by magnesium deficiency. by eight hours,  <dig> of  <dig> genes were induced and by 28 hours only  <dig> of  <dig> genes were induced by magnesium deficiency. in the leaves,  <dig> of  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> were induced at  <dig>   <dig> and 28 hours respectively by magnesium deficiency. their time points do not allow for direct comparison with the clark iron response, but the pattern is reminiscent in that roots show much activity early and taper off, while leaves have larger expression changes as stress persists.

one of the aims of this study was to identify genes directly involved in the uptake and utilization of iron in soybean. a recent review by kobayashi and nishizawa  <cit>  generated a comprehensive list of genes known to be involved in iron homeostasis responses in higher plants. we used this data to identify homologous sequences, responding to iron deficiency, in our rna-seq data. the gene expression changes are similar to what has been shown in other plants. in total, we identified  <dig> degs with homology to known iron deficiency genes. in the soybean root, we see all the components of the iron transport machinery induced; aha <dig>  fro <dig>  fro <dig>  fit <dig>  irt <dig>  vit <dig> , and nas <dig>  vit <dig> functions in moving iron into vacuoles for storage  <cit> . the repression of vit <dig> at six hours of iron stress suggests that the roots are switching from storage to uptake and mobilization of stored iron as the stress persists.

in arabidopsis, most of the genes involved in iron homeostasis have been found in both leaves and roots, with atfit <dig> notably missing from leaves  <cit> . it is interesting that in soybean, not only are multiple copies of fit <dig> expressed in leaves, but they are differentially expressed at both one and six hours of iron stress. yellow stripe-like  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are well characterized in iron-transport  <cit> , while the function of ysl <dig> in metal transport is only putative. we observe ysl <dig> responding to iron deficiency in leaves, but no other ysl homologs were significantly affected. atbts has been shown to function in leaf iron homeostasis  <cit> , but more studies have been conducted on its role in the roots. strangely, we do not see bts in our root data, but this may be due to timing of the experiment as bts levels are elevated in arabidopsis roots by 24 hours of iron stress  <cit> . such differences between soybean and arabidopsis in iron response are worth investigating further.

one novel approach we used to characterize iron deficiency responses in soybean was to identify gene families among our differentially expressed genes . one hour roots had a number of differentially expressed gene families with ten or more sequences. interestingly, several of these were related to the development and maintenance of casparian strips and all were induced by iron deficiency. group  <dig> contained  <dig> degs from one hour roots orthologous to casparian strip membrane domain proteins   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these proteins were identified by roppolo et al.  <cit>  for their role in the development of casparian strips. group  <dig> contained nine degs from one hour roots with homology to dirigent-like proteins, including orthologs of enhanced suberin  <dig> . recently, hosmani et al.  <cit>  found that esb <dig> was required for the formation of casparian strips. group  <dig> contained  <dig> degs with homology to peroxidases in one hour roots. lee et al.  <cit>  found that peroxidase atper <dig> was also required for timely formation of casparian strips. other peroxidases  were also induced in the root endodermis relative to the rest of the root. given these results we examined the rest of the differentially expressed genes for other genes that could function in casparian strips. the top deg in one hour root is a homolog of a type iii peroxidase, rci <dig> , which has been shown to contribute to ros production in potassium deficiency  <cit> . four other homologs of rci <dig> are also highly induced in one hour root . an ortholog of respiratory burst oxide homolog f  was also induced by iron stress in one hour roots. lee et al.  <cit>  found that rbohf was also localized to casparian strips and was required for their formation. further, lee et al. hypothesized that casp proteins provide a scaffold for rbohf to produced hydrogen peroxide which is then used by the peroxidases to polymerize lignins to form casparian strips. the casparian strip has been shown by perls/dab staining in frd <dig> mutants to act as a barrier to fe within the root  <cit> . additionally, we see seven homologs of net1d  upregulated in response to iron deficiency. the net1d family has recently been shown to be an actin-binding protein highly expressed in the stele and conducting tissues of the roots  <cit> . given that casparian strips are thought to control the passage of water and mineral nutrients into the vascular system, which would then need to pass through the stele into the xylem, it interesting to speculate that increased expression of these genes in response to iron stress could facilitate the uptake of iron.

we also identified a putative family  of  <dig> 2og-fe-dependent oxygenases differentially expressed in one hour roots. while seven of these were induced by iron deficiency, two were repressed. reciprocal best blastp  <cit>  identified two orthologs of feruloyl-coa 6’ hydroxylase  <dig> , both induced by iron deficiency. schmid et al.  <cit>  found that f6’h <dig> was required for coumarin synthesis and was also induced by iron deficiency. recently, rodríguez-celma et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that arabidopsis excretes phenolic compounds, such as coumarin, in response to low iron. fourcroy et al.  <cit>  found that atpdr <dig> was induced by iron deficiency in arabidopsis and was required for the secretion of coumarin compounds aiding in iron acquisition. therefore, we examined our degs to identify similar genes. we found differential expression of a number of these genes in one hour roots including orthologs of pleiotrophic drug resistance protein atpdr <dig> , atpdr <dig> , atpdr <dig>  and caffeic acid o-methyltransferase atomt <dig> . further, we found the go terms associated with coumarin  biosynthesis and metabolism were significantly overrepresented in one hour roots. this suggests that secretion of coumarins is essential for iron uptake in soybean as well.

the second main aim of this study was to identify signaling genes that regulate iron deficiency responses. the virtual on/off switch of gene expression we observed between one and six hours suggests a prominent role for transcription factors in establishing and regulating early iron-stress responses in roots and leaves. our analyses of the transcription factor families within our deg list led to interesting results. within the  <dig> degs in this study, there were  <dig> transcription factors representing  <dig> families. we found two transcription factors, both downregulated, in one hour leaves but  <dig> transcription factors representing ten families that were either induced or repressed in roots at the same time. as was true for degs, we saw this pattern reverse by six hours with  <dig> transcription factors representing  <dig> families differentially expressed in leaves and only four transcription factors in roots.

transcription factor binding sites, which were overrepresented in our degs, correlated with this pattern as well, with six hour leaves containing the highest number of unique transcription factor binding sites, and binding sites within six hour leaf transcripts greater than six hour root transcripts. surprisingly, the degree of overlap between transcription factor family binding sites across time points and tissues was larger than might have been expected given the differences in gene expression across time points and tissues. there were  <dig> transcription factor binding sites that were significantly overrepresented  in at least two time/tissue gene lists out of  <dig> transcription factor binding sites significantly overrepresented in at least one time point or tissue. many of the transcription factor families corresponding to the significant transcription factor binding sites were not identified as significantly differentially expressed themselves, suggesting that the complexity of the early stress response is greater than what we captured.

using a combination of different approaches, we also observed evidence of hormone-related signaling in our data. recently, garcia et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that genes involved in iron deficiency responses, such as atfit, atbhlh <dig>  atfro <dig>  atirt <dig>  atnas <dig>  atnas <dig> and atfrd <dig>  were induced in response to idc, ethylene, and nitric oxide . our results also confirm a role for ethylene and no in idc responses. in one hour roots, we observed differential expression of eleven genes involved in ethylene production, all of which were induced by iron deficiency. these encode ten oxidoreductases  and a 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase . acc is converted to ethylene by acc synthase and acc oxidase  <cit> . while ethylene synthesis appeared to be induced by iron deficiency in one hour roots, apetala 2/ethylene-responsive element binding protein  transcription factors were repressed. in six hour roots, genes involved in response to ethylene  were significantly overrepresented and induced by iron deficiency. this included homologs of the ethylene sensors atein <dig> , atein <dig> , aterf <dig>  and atetr <dig> . glyma03g <dig>  has an extreme fold change of - <dig>  in one hour root to  <dig>  in six hour roots. the chitinase atchib , pdf <dig>   and pr <dig> , which are all induced by ethylene  <cit> , were repressed in six hour roots. the promoters of genes differentially expressed in six hour roots had an overrepresentation of the ap2-erebp dreb1b transcription factor binding site . the induction of the ethylene biosynthetic enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase  in six hour roots, suggests that ethylene may be required for sustained idc signaling in soybean.

no has protective effects on iron-stressed organisms, ranging from animals to plants  <cit> . homologs of proteins involved in no synthesis and nitrate transport such as atnir <dig> , atnrt <dig>  and atnia <dig>  were repressed by iron deficiency in one hour leaves, but homologs of the nitrate transporters nrt1- <dig>  and nrt1- <dig>  were induced in six hour leaves. we also found that binding sites of the no regulated transcription factor tga <dig>  <cit>  were overrepresented in one hour leaves. these findings suggest no synthesis is occurring mainly in the leaves. no can interact with iron-sulfur cluster enzymes such as ribonuclease reductase, aconitase and nadh dehydrogenase to inhibit dna synthesis and mobilize stored iron reserves. aconitase aco <dig>  was induced in one hour roots while nadh dehydrogenase nad <dig>  was down in six hour roots. in arabidopsis and cucumber, aco <dig>  is involved in ethylene synthesis, has also been shown to increase no production, and we see aco <dig>  induced in six hour roots  <cit> . we also see two nitrate transporters differentially expressed, but in opposite direction in roots after six hours of iron stress; atnrt <dig>   and atnrt1- <dig> .

we observed other interesting signaling pathways changing in response to iron deficiency including genes involved in the sucrose efflux pathway. sweet transport proteins act redundantly to mediate sucrose efflux in arabidopsis  <cit> . atsweet11; <dig> double mutants were defective in phloem loading, had reduced growth, and had increased sucrose levels in the leaves. in addition, expression of sweet proteins was tightly correlated with other sucrose synthesis and transport genes including sucrose phosphate synthase  and a sucrose transporter . in our experiments we observed repression of two sweet <dig> sucrose transporters , a homolog of atsps3f , and a homolog of atsps4f  in the leaves one hour after iron stress. however, a homolog of atsweet <dig>  was induced by iron stress in one hour leaves. by six hours after iron stress, none of the soybean sweet genes were differentially expressed but a homolog of atsuc <dig>  was induced by iron stress. similarly, genes involved in response to sucrose starvation were significantly overrepresented in six hour leaves . alterations in sucrose efflux could signal stressful conditions from shoot to root by limiting root growth and potentially affecting nutrient uptake.

identifying genes involved in sugar signaling ties in with previous work from our group investigating the role of dna replication in iron deficiency stress responses. o’rourke et al.  <cit>  found that genes involved in dna replication were repressed in leaves in response to long term  iron stress in the iron efficient line clark. atwood et al.  <cit>  found that dna replication genes were differentially expressed between two near isogenic lines  that differed in their iron efficiency. silencing of the dna replication gene gmrpa3c  in isoclark, to mimic expression in clark, resulted in improved idc symptoms and significantly reduced growth. rna-seq of silenced plants revealed gmrpa3c silencing resulted in massive transcriptional reprogramming with genes involved in defense and immunity, circadian rhythm, photosynthesis, protein modifications, growth and iron uptake and transport significantly differentially expressed. we hypothesized  <cit>  this response was controlled by the snrk1/tor complex which is regulated by sucrose and heavy carbon load  <cit> . activation of snrk <dig>  initiates a phosphorylation relay  <cit>  that inhibits components of the snrk1/tor pathway including the e2f transcription factor that controls the cell cycle and dna replication  <cit> . in the analysis reported here, we see differential expression of genes involved in sucrose transport and dna replication. in addition, we find that e2f transcription factor binding site  is significantly overrepresented  in six hour leaves and that a homolog of atetg <dig>  is repressed by iron deficiency.

in a general sense, the snrk1/tor signaling pathway is controlled by nutrient and energy availability inside the cell, but it remains unclear how external and endogenous signals regulate nutrient and energy status. recently schröder et al.  characterized the extracellularly located exo and exo-like  family in arabidopsis. while exo is required for growth under standard conditions, exl <dig>  exl <dig> and exl <dig> function to slow growth during low carbon availability. lisso et al.  <cit>  used exo t-dna mutants and exo overexpression in exo mutants coupled with sucrose and trehalose feeding studies to study the function of exo. they found that exo mutants grew slowly, regardless of sugar levels, suggesting exo modifies sugar responses during seedling growth. further, exo regulated the expression of a number of sugar responsive genes including atdin <dig> and atsuc <dig>  they hypothesized that exo could link extracellular and intracellular carbon and sugar signaling. in our six hour leaf data, we identified eight homologs of exo and exl <dig>  repressed in response to iron deficiency with fold changes ranging from - <dig>  to - <dig> . similarly, three homologs of atdin <dig>  and the homolog of atsuc <dig> mentioned above were all induced by iron deficiency. these data suggest that sweet and exo proteins regulate the snrk1/tor signaling pathway in response to iron deficiency. further, recent work by xiong et al.  <cit>  shows that both sucrose and glucose signaling are components of the snrk1/tor pathway. our data adds support to the model proposed in atwood et al.  <cit>  that iron deficiency in clark is regulated by snrk1/tor signaling.

the coordination of growth and developmental pathways with stress responses makes sense, however many idc studies have focused on long term stress responses. in soybean, even short term idc has a long lasting effect on yield  <cit> . while iron efficient soybean lines would seem preferable, they generally yield lower than iron inefficient lines in iron sufficient conditions  <cit> , again suggesting a link between the regulation of growth and development and nutrient stress. given this response, idc tolerant soybean lines are not employed by farmers unless completely necessary. therefore, research needs to focus on translating expression studies to the identification of target genes for crop improvement. while our analysis identified hundreds of degs, identifying those genes responsible for greater stress tolerance that have little or no impact on yield is an important challenge for the future.
