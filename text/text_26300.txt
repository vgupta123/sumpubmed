BACKGROUND
plants are under constant threat of infections caused by pathogens that range from viruses, bacteria, fungi to nematodes and insects. the efficacy of plant defense depends on its ability to recognize a pathogen and mount the appropriate defense response. plants often employ cell surface and intracellular receptors to detect a pathogen associated molecular pattern  and trigger immune response against the invader. polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein  is one among the pathogenesis-related  proteins that is found at the cell surface of plant cells. it binds and inhibits the enzyme polygalacturonase  from the invading pathogen which could be fungus, insect or bacterium, thus preventing its colonization in the host cell and hence the progress of the disease  <cit> . polygalacturonases  are a class of pectinolytic enzyme secreted by the pathogen at the early stages of infection to depolymerize homogalacturonan , the main component of pectin in the plant cell wall  <cit> . hga is the  <dig>   <dig> linked alpha-d-galactosyluronic acid polymer found in the plant cell which forms the first line of barrier and thereby plays a critical role in controlling pathogen invasion  <cit> .

the interaction of the plant protein pgip with the fungal or insect pg limits the destructive potential of the pg and leads to the accumulation of elicitor active oligogalacturonides as shown by in vitro studies  <cit> . hence pgip seems to exert a dual role during fungal attack. it limits pathogen penetration and tissue colonization by inhibiting pg activity, this in turn, favours the accumulation of oligogalacturonides, which activate a prompt defense response  <cit> .

pgips belong to the leucine-rich repeat  super family of proteins  <cit>  containing tandem repeats of a 20- <dig> amino acid stretch of the extracytoplasmic type with a consensus that bear a conserved part  and a variable part  <cit> . the lrr-fold  which is believed to be specialized in protein-protein interaction is quite extensively used for the immune functions and for the recognition of non-self molecules by plants. the crystal structure of the only pgip  as well as the first lrr protein belonging to the plant-specific subfamily  <cit>   reveals a typical curved and elongated shape. eight β strands  comprise the inner concave face of the curved surface. on the opposite side of the β sheet, there are nine  <dig> helices that are almost parallel to the β sheet. the concave surface is known to bear residues necessary for binding and recognition specificity in this class of protein  <cit> .

pgips function as very specific inhibitors  <cit> . pgip from a particular plant that is able to inhibit the pg from a certain pathogen might not be able to inhibit pgs from other pathogens. besides, for cases when a pgip is able to inhibit pgs from different pathogens, the percent inhibition differs. thus in plants, small gene families encode pgip isoforms that differ in affinity and specificity for pgs secreted by different pathogens  <cit> . recognition specificity results from a few variations in the amino acid sequence of the pgips  <cit> . plants successfully defend themselves from the attack of a wide range of pgs from pathogenic microorganisms through the role played by protein-protein interaction involving these pgip proteins.

significant contributions have been made with experimental studies on the different isoforms of pgip from a variety of plants. it has been seen that the overexpression of two pgip genes, atpgip <dig> and atpgip <dig> genes from arabidopsis thaliana limits the colonization by b. cinerea and also reduces the disease symptoms  <cit> . in transgenic tomato and grapevine plants, a significant increase of pg-inhibitory activity and a decrease in susceptibility to b. cinerea have been observed. plant resistance have been successfully enhanced by the overexpression of pear pgip in tomato  <cit>  and vitis vinifera  <cit> , and also bean pgip in tobacco  <cit> . accumulation of information on several of the properties exhibited by pgips have generated an interest in exploiting them as tools for enhancing plant resistance. in this regard, pgips of bean plant  needs special mention.

bean pgips are encoded by a family of genes  <cit> , the products of which are pvpgip <dig>  pvpgip <dig>  pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig>  all of these show distinct regulation and specificity exhibiting different inhibitory capabilities against the pgs of botrytis cinerea, colletotrichum gloeosporioides, stenocarpella maydis, fusarium moniliforme and aspergillus niger  <cit> . the four mature products of the pgip genes have a very high extent of sequence similarity differing between  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. phylogenetic analysis indicates that pvpgip1-pvpgip <dig> groups with gmpgip <dig> of soybean , a species of the phaseoleae tribe close to bean, which suggests that these two genes are probably closer to the ancestral gene than are pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, although pgip <dig> and pgip <dig> from phaseolus vulgaris share 99% sequence similarity, pvpgip <dig> has been reported to inhibit pg from fusarium moniliforme  while pvpgip <dig> does not  <cit> . strikingly, gmpgip <dig> of soybean , shares a much lesser similarity of 88% with pvpgip <dig> and yet has the ability to inhibit fmpg with an inhibition kinetics similar to that of pvpgip <dig>  <cit> . it is thus evident that the ability of pgip molecules to defend plants against infection is not buried in the extent of similarity shared between the sequences alone. probable implications could be the presence of key structural features important for the necessary protein-protein interaction that need to be conserved to preserve the function.

it would be interesting to study the molecular interaction of different pgips sharing different range of sequence variation, with the same pg molecule to elucidate the relation between the extent of sequence similarity and the corresponding ability/inability to inhibit pg. three pgips, pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig> from phaseolus vulgaris and gmpgip <dig> from glycine max have been chosen for this purpose keeping in mind that they share a high level of sequence similarity and yet show distinct difference in their function as expressed through their ability/inability to inhibit the same pg from fusarium moniliforme . in this study, homology models of two pgip molecules namely pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> have been built using the crystal structure of pvpgip <dig> as the template. the crystal structure of fmpg being available, the three pgips have been subsequently docked to fmpg. in order to elucidate the mechanism underlying and the strategy undertaken by the plants in utilizing the different isoforms of pgip, a comparative study of the interaction between these three pairs namely pvpgip <dig> and fmpg, pvpgip <dig> and fmpg and gmpgip <dig> and fmpg have been accomplished. a comparison of the binding modes, the interacting residues and the electrostatic potential surface along the interface of the pgip-pg complex have been investigated. change in intermolecular distances, hydrogen bond formation and electrostatic surface potential upon in silico mutation of pvpgip <dig> have also been explored.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
domain search
domain search using pfam  <cit>  discloses that the three pgip molecules  studied here share identical domain architecture consisting of one lrr_nt <dig>  at the n-terminal end and nine leucine-rich repeats  . out of the nine lrrs, four have been identified as plant-specific  lrrs  using emboss  <cit>  with the pattern xxxxxxxx gxipxxgx.

pairwise alignment
pairwise alignment carried out in order to identify similarities between the pgip molecules at the sequence level, shows only eight varying residue positions between pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig>  and  <dig> varying positions between pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> . four out of the eight variations between pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig> fall in the repeat regions and the rest reside in the non-lrr  region of the proteins. two  out of the four ps-lrrs and the first  and the sixth  repeat harbour these four variations mentioned above. the  <dig> variations between pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> on the other hand, are divided amongst all domains including lrrnt_ <dig> and all the plant specific lrrs .

distribution of the variations in the domains
out of the  <dig> residues that differ in gmpgip <dig> from pvpgip <dig> only two changes  are common with the  <dig> differing residues between pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig> leaving the rest  <dig> variations to be at unique positions.  <dig> out of these  <dig> fall in the lrr regions and  <dig> in the lrrnt_ <dig> region leaving altogether  <dig> positions to remain scattered in the intervening non-lrr regions. the sequence variation that fall in the lrr region in pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> with pvpgip <dig> could be distributed amongst the conserved portion of the repeat or the variable portion of it. it becomes an important task to determine this, as there are positions in the repeats where sequence variation is accepted without an associated change in structure. to account for the distribution of these variations with respect to different regions in the repeats, we constructed individual multiple sequence alignments. figure  <dig> shows the multiple sequence alignment of nine repeats each from pvpgip <dig>  pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  the conserved region of the repeats are marked by the conserved pattern of lrrs  while the rest of the repeat signify its variable region. considering an insertion of a residue  in r <dig> for pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig> and an insertion of p in r <dig> of gmpgip <dig> at another position, the variations  can be rightly explained to be concentrated in positions  where the motif itself has the provision for changes. the details of the distribution of the variations  in the lrr  and variable  region) and the non-lrr regions with reference to the residue type is tabulated in the additional file  <dig>  depending on whether the variation is in the conserved or variable part of the repeat or in the non-lrr region, black, grey and hatched vertical bars are respectively used in figure 2a and 2c. in both these proteins , most of the changes that fall in the lrr region  are either an allowed variant of the conserved position  or is any amino acid in the x position of the conserved region or is an amino acid belonging to the variable region of the repeat . one exception is the variation in the conserved position n of r <dig> in pvpgip <dig>  where the replacing amino acid h is not an allowed variant. regarding the variations in the non-lrr region, additional file  <dig> points out that whereas pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig> share 50% of the changes in this region, gmpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig> show only 15% of it. this could probably indicate specific regions of importance in pgips for the introduction of variation for recognition of different enzymes from pathogens.

modelling
the crystal structure of pvpgip <dig>  being available and also since pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig> as well as pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> share high percentage of sequence similarity, homology models of pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> were built using pvpgip <dig> as template. one model each for pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> were selected using procheck  <cit> . in each case, the model that was chosen supported the following criteria:

 more number of residues in the core region

 no residues in the disallowed region

these models of pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> were solvated in water and were subjected to energy minimization followed by molecular dynamics simulation of  <dig> ns. a similar scheme of equilibration was taken up for the crystal structure of pvpgip <dig>  rmsd of the equilibrated structures of pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> were calculated with respect to the equilibrated structure of pvpgip <dig> and was found to be  <dig> Å and  <dig> Å respectively.

docking
we used gramm-x  <cit>  for docking three pairs of proteins in order to unveil the mode of interaction within and across each pair. this docking program executes a rigid-body search using fast fourier transform  correlation with simplified geometry employing shape complementarity and hydrophobicity in the scoring function. in this study we have used gramm-x as a protein-protein docking program as it extends the gramm fast fourier transformation methodology by applying smoothed lennard-jones potential, refinement stage and knowledge-based scoring, thus giving rise to best surface match. the output of gramm-x is a pdb file containing the structures of ten models ranked as the most probable prediction candidate, according to the scoring function used. the cell-wall degrading enzyme pg, from the fungus fusarium moniliforme was common in all the pairs and the other three molecules include pvpgip <dig>  pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  the crystal structure of fmpg  used in this study had also been solvated in water and was then subjected to energy minimization followed by molecular dynamics  of  <dig> ns.

docking studies of fmpg-pvpgip2
it has been reported that since pvpgip <dig> inhibits fmpg, hence one would expect pvpgip <dig> to interact with pg by blocking the active site and/or the substrate binding cleft of the fungal enzyme. we obtained top scoring ten docked complexes of pvpgip2-fmpg from gramm-x. one model in the exact expected orientation was selected on the basis of the existing experimental studies . in the docked complex , pvpgip <dig> has covered the active site cleft by hindering the substrate binding site of fmpg. this is evident from the change in solvent accessible surface area   for the residues asp- <dig>  asp- <dig>  asp- <dig>  arg- <dig>  and lys- <dig> of fmpg that are known to be located inside the deep cleft and form the putative active site  <cit> . functional studies confirm the involvement of these residues in the enzymatic reaction mechanism and or binding to the substrate which is in agreement with the reported mode of competitive inhibition with fmpg  <cit> .

in this model structure, the residues of pvpgip <dig> that is known to be functionally important, have shown considerable change in sasa , indicating that they play a key role in interaction. four residues  out of five that were identified by leckie et al.  <cit>  as interacting residues of pvpgip <dig> are expected to reside in the interacting surface of pvpgip <dig> in the pvpgip2-fmpg complex, inferred on the basis of the considerable change in sasa .

docking studies of fmpg-pvpgip1
out of the ten potential candidates for models of pvpgip1-fmpg complex obtained from gramm-x, only in one model pvpgip <dig> docked to the same face of fmpg as was found in the model for the complex of pvpgip2-fmpg . in the rest of the nine models, the pgip molecule docked to a different face of fmpg indicating a gross inability of these models of pvpgip <dig> to block either the substrate binding site or the active site of fmpg. in the selected model, whereas the portion marked with the yellow ellipse is evidently seen to be blocked in the other two complexes, the same is not the case with pvpgip <dig>  this is in complete agreement with the experimental observation of pvpgip <dig> being incapable of inhibiting the pg from fusarium moniliforme. this model in which fmpg docks to pvpgip <dig> at the face similar to the one in pvpgip <dig>  of the pvpgip2-fmpg complex, is considered for further studies to confirm the inability of the protein in inhibition towards the enzyme.

docking studies of fmpg-gmpgip3
it has been reported that gmpgip <dig> possesses an inhibiting activity towards the pg of fusarium moniliforme like pvpgip <dig>  no mutational studies being available for gmpgip <dig>  the docked structure of the gmpgip3-fmpg complex was therefore selected from the top scoring ten models reported by gramm-x using the knowledge obtained from experimental studies carried out for pvpgip <dig>  in the selected model of the complex , gmpgip <dig> has blocked the active site cleft of fmpg. the docked model therefore is in agreement with the experimental observation of the ability of gmpgip <dig> in inhibiting the enzymatic activity of fmpg. the important residues v, s, q and h of gmpgip <dig> that are also present in pvpgip <dig> show considerable decrease in solvent accessible surface area  indicating their active involvement in protein-protein interaction, an identical observation that holds true for pvpgip <dig>  thus like pvpgip <dig>  gmpgip <dig> too blocks the active site cleft and hinders the substrate binding site of fmpg bearing a similar mode of competitive inhibition.

comparative study of protein-protein interactions in the three complexes
ionic interactions
we have used pic  <cit>  for comparison of interactions recognized in the three complexes. ionic interaction that is believed to play an important role in protein-protein interactions were studied for the three complexes namely pvpgip2-fmpg, pvpgip1-fmpg and gmpgip3-fmpg. table  <dig> shows that whereas this kind of interaction plays a vital role both in pvpgip2-fmpg and gmpgip3-fmpg complexes, it is not so for the pvpgip1-fmpg complex.

electrostatic surface potential of individual pgips and the complexes
adaptive poisson-boltzmann solver  package  <cit>  was used to generate the electrostatic surface potential for each of pvpgip <dig>  pvpgip <dig>  gmpgip <dig> and fmpg, as shown in figure 5a, b, c and 5d respectively. it is evidently clear that the electrostatic surface potential for pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  show similarity along the surface at the concave face which is the site for interaction with fmpg. pvpgip <dig> shows a distinctly different potential surface at a region in this face, even though it bears very few variations at the sequence level when compared to pvpgip <dig> 

in silico mutation of pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip2-fmpg complex
pvpgip <dig> was mutated at six positions, with the amino acid present in pvpgip <dig> at that position, using what if  <cit> . electrostatic surface potential was generated for all the six mutated pvpgip <dig> molecules. the surface drawn with the q224k mutation showed considerable change from the wild type protein . the other single mutations did not show much of a significant change in the electrostatic surface potential. it may be mentioned that when these mutated pvpgip <dig> molecules were docked to fmpg, none of the complexes showed any resemblance to the conformation found for the pvpgip1-fmpg complex, shown in figure 6a.

when in the pvpgip2-fmpg complex, q  of pvpgip <dig> was mutated to k, using what if, the resultant complex showed quite a few of the following deviations from the complex with the wild type protein. hard sphere contact distances  <cit>  between heavy atoms revealed an existence of steric clash between the nζ of q224k of the mutated pvpgip <dig> and cε of k of fmpg. whereas the contact distance between the atoms should be more than  <dig>  Å, the distance in the complex with mutation was  <dig>  Å. the complex bearing the mutation also showed the absence of the predicted hydrogen bond involving q of pvpgip <dig> as obtained from pic results. even the ionic interaction that prevails in the wild type complex of pvpgip2-fmpg vanishes with this single mutation. the in silico mutation study, confirms the importance of the q residue which has been experimentally found to give rise to a 70% reduction in the inhibition ability of the protein upon single mutation. the study also suggests probable reasons like a different electrostatic potential surface, steric clash or lack of hydrogen bonds that might explain why pvpgip <dig> with only eight residues has a different mode of binding to fmpg.

the above in silico study clearly portrays how a single mutation in pvpgip <dig> results in disallowed hard sphere contact distances between the two protein molecules thus indicating the importance of van der waals interaction in plant defense. q at the 224th position which is also involved in forming hydrogen bonds, plays a substantial role in this interaction. since gramm-x shows that the mode of binding of pvpgip <dig> with fmpg is different from pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> and further more since gramm-x has a major involvement of smoothed lennard-jones potential in scoring, we infer that the discrimination in recognition has a significant contribution from van der waals interaction. role of van der waals forces have already been shown to be important in offering stability to several protein-ligand and in some cases dna-ligand complexes prevailing in biological systems. molecular dynamics studies have shown van der waals interaction to play a vital role in groove binding of the repressor fragment of a bacteriophage to its operator oligonucleotide  <cit> . in a study with proteins, it has been shown that the mouse major urinary protein  and its ligand show a binding thermodynamics that is dominated by dispersion interactions  <cit> . the involvement of the van der waals forces in plant defense although not in specific recognition has also been reported. many plants respond to pathogenic attack by producing defense proteins that bind to chitin, a polysaccharide present in the cell wall of the invading fungus or exoskeleton of infecting insects. nmr studies show the involvement of van der waals interactions between the methyl acetamide group of the glcnac unit and a hydrophobic patch of the plant protein  <cit> . studies on the characteristics of the sugar-binding sites in plant and animal lectin show van der waals interaction and hydrogen bonds to contribute significantly. selectivity for different sugars result from hydrogen bonds and unwanted recognition is prevented by steric exclusion  <cit> . here in the case of plant defense through pgip, the influence of van der waals interaction therefore does not seem to be atypical.

in the present study, we have failed to address pertinent components like the change in the binding free energy change  between the wild type and the mutated pgips. in order to obtain experimentally relevant information concerning the thermodynamic properties of binding, we wish to work in future, with advanced simulation methods such as free energy perturbation or thermodynamic integration to assess the binding free energy changes upon mutation of the important residues in pgip.

CONCLUSIONS
it has been noted from our study on sequence analysis that 50% of the sequence variation between pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig> fall in the non-lrr region whereas only 15% of the variation in gmpgip <dig> with pvpgip <dig> fall in the non-lrr region. this observation suggests specific regions in pgips favourable for the introduction of variation in recognition of the pathogen molecules. structural studies involving docking techniques suggest the mode of binding of the fungal enzyme fmpg by pgip <dig> from phaseolus vulgaris to be similar to that of its homologue pgip <dig> from glycine max. in each case of binding, the active site of the enzyme from fusarium moniliforme is being blocked by the pgip molecule, supporting the experimentally observed phenomenon of these pgip molecules being able to inhibit the fungal enzyme upon invasion. pgip <dig> from the same plant phaseolus vulgaris which is incapable of inhibiting fmpg, binds to fmpg in an evidently different mode, although pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig> share a higher degree of sequence similarity compared to pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  electrostatic surface potential reveals considerable difference in the interacting surface of pvpgip <dig> when compared to pvpgip <dig> or gmpgip <dig>  thus, electrostatic and van der waals interactions may play a significant role in pgips for proper recognition and discrimination of pgs.
