BACKGROUND
photosynthesis in the majority of plants occurs in a single photosynthetic cell type   <cit> . within the chloroplasts, the enzyme ribulose- <dig>  5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  fixes atmospheric carbon by addition of co <dig> and water to the five-carbon sugar ribulose- <dig>  5-bisphosphate . rubisco will also catalyze the oxidation of rubp in a process known as photorespiration that does not fix carbon  <cit> . the reduction in efficiency associated with photorespiration and the energetic costs of recycling its products has been estimated to limit the performance of c <dig> photosynthesis by as much as 30% in hot arid conditions  <cit> . a number of taxa utilize a two-step carbon fixation process, known as c <dig> photosynthesis, to limit the impact of photorespiration upon photosynthetic performance  <cit> . plants that utilize c <dig> photosynthesis appear to be at a particular fitness advantage under conditions of limited water availability, high temperature and high irradiance light  <cit> . interestingly, some of the most promising grasses for biofuel production are c <dig> grasses, including miscanthus × giganteus , panicum virgatum , zea mays , sorghum bicolor  and saccharum officinarum .

in c <dig> plants, rubisco accumulation is spatially restricted to co2-rich sites within the leaf so that the carboxylase reaction is favoured over photorespiration. in maize, rubisco accumulation is restricted to thick-walled bundle sheath  cells that surround the leaf veins . carbon is initially fixed in adjacent mesophyll  cells and subsequently transported, by a multi-enzyme carbon shuttle, into the b, where decarboxylation elevates local co <dig> levels and generates an environment for efficient rubisco function .

cell-type specific differences in morphology and physiology are fundamental to c <dig> photosynthesis  <cit> . detailed analysis of b and m differentiation in maize has shown that rubisco, enzymes of a c <dig> carbon shuttle and components of the light-harvesting machinery accumulate to different levels in b and m cells  <cit> . b cell chloroplasts are predominately agranal and do not accumulate key components of the water oxidizing complex of photosystem ii   <cit> . consequently, a number of processes requiring chemical reduction, including portions of calvin cycle  <cit> , synthesis of antioxidants  <cit>  and nitrogen assimilation  <cit>  are localized to the m cells. despite detailed understanding of certain metabolic pathways utilized in c <dig> photosynthesis, the molecular mechanisms governing cell differentiation and the full extent of metabolic partitioning are still to be fully characterized. promoter fusion, methylation assays and transient expression studies have identified a number of cis acting elements in the promoter sequences of c4-related genes  <cit> . much less is known about trans acting factors that may drive the c4differentiation process  <cit> . genetic approaches have resulted in the isolation of maize mutants characterized by b cell-specific defects, but these mutants have not directly identified regulators of cell-specific development  <cit> .

many biochemical and molecular studies of c <dig> photosynthetic cell types have made use of techniques for isolation of separated cells. typically, b cells have been isolated as vascular strands by mechanical disruption and m cells isolated as protoplasts by enzymatic digestion  <cit> . therefore, different isolation protocols complicate the identification of differences between the two cell types. this is especially true when comparing the accumulation of rna transcripts because changes can occur rapidly in response to the stresses of protoplast preparation  <cit> . when small numbers of genes have been analyzed, additional treatments have been used to control for the effect of these stresses . in contrast, previous multi-gene profiling studies of c <dig> cell types have not accounted for such effects in the initial analysis  <cit> . following preliminary two-sample microarray experiments, we were especially concerned with the problem of mistakenly identifying stress-induced transcripts as m enriched .

in order to control for a stress effect associated with m cell isolation, total leaf and stressed total leaf samples were included in analysis. in general, microarray experiments are based on paired comparisons  <cit> . multiple paired comparisons may be linked, as in a time course, or may be cross-referenced, as in a clustering analysis  <cit> . in the case of the isolated c <dig> cell types, the situation is somewhat different in that cell type and effects of the separation protocol are partially confounded between treatments. to formally describe this relationship, we have developed an analytical model to describe c <dig> gene expression and to allow elimination of the stress effect resulting from protoplast isolation. using this approach, we have identified  <dig>  features in the maize array project oligonucleotide array that are predicted to be b or m enriched. we also present an analysis of the same data without consideration of the stress effect. comparison of these two analyses demonstrates the importance of considering the stress effect and the application of a statistical modelling approach to control confounding factors in microarray experiments.

RESULTS
experimental design and data collection
b strands  and m protoplasts  were isolated from  <dig> day-old w <dig> inbred maize seedlings by mechanical disruption and enzymatic digestion, as previously described  <cit>  . isolation of m protoplasts required a  <dig> h enzymatic incubation that was not performed during isolation of b strands. to control for transcriptional differences arising from these different treatments, additional total leaf  and total leaf stress  samples were isolated. both tt and ts samples contain a combination of b and m cells. leaves for the tt sample were harvested and cut into thin strips as for the tb sample and then frozen directly in liquid nitrogen rather than subjected to mechanical disruption. leaves for the ts sample were harvested and cut as for the tm sample, subjected to a  <dig> h mock enzymatic digestion and then frozen. an interwoven loop design  <cit>  was used to directly compare all combinations of the four treatment groups  on two-label microarrays . to maximize biological replication, a unique set of seedlings was used for each tb, tm, tt and ts replicate. the resulting design used  <dig> independent rna samples analysed over  <dig> array sets.

samples were analysed by hybridisation to a long-oligonucleotide microarray produced by the maize array project consortium  <cit> . maize sequences for design of this chip were predominantly selected from the the institute for genomic research  maize gene index  <cit> . to manufacture this microarray, approximately  <dig>  sequences were positively orientated and identified as suitable for oligonucleotide design. this initial sequence set was supplemented with further est sequences, organellar sequences, repeat sequences and community requests to provide a final design data set of  <dig>  features. single 70-mer oligonucleotides were designed for each sequence in the design set and printed over two glass slides.

array detection  and image analysis were performed as described in methods. images and intensity data may be accessed in a miame compliant form at the maize oligonucleotide array project website  <cit> . data are also available in the ncbi geo database, series record gse <dig>  the data are presented in full on both the maize array project and ncbi websites.

feature intensity values were log-transformed and corrected for local background signal and a lowess procedure  <cit>  was used to normalize between channels for each slide . on the basis of the tt treatment , features with either low or saturating signal intensity were discarded . a stringent filtering of low expression values was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data set in light of the complexity of the experimental design. high expression filtering was less stringent to avoid elimination of previously characterized, high abundance, c <dig> 'marker' transcripts. following filtering,  <dig>  unique features were considered for subsequent analysis . we considered this reduced data set appropriate for model development while maintaining sufficient and meaningful biological information to allow general conclusions on the extent of differentiation between b and m cell types.

construction of a model to include a stress term in the analysis of the b and m data set
the experimental design required the analysis of four, partially confounded treatment groups; i.e. the tt treatment contains both b and m cell types found in tb and tm treatments, while the tm treatment combines the effects of cell-specificity and the stress effect that is also seen in ts. in the following discussion, the term 'stress' is used to refer specifically to the effect of protoplast isolation on transcript levels. importantly, although the aim of the experiment is to compare expression levels between b and m cell types, the level of gene expression within the intact m could never be directly measured because of the stress effect of m cell isolation. a model was constructed in order to formally describe this situation and to allow statistical elimination of the stress effect.

let v1f and v2f represent the log <dig> transformed expression level of a given feature  in b and m cell types, respectively. the aim is to estimate  on a feature-by-feature basis. we use c to label the leaf sample, whether b cell prep , m cell prep  or total leaf sample . the parameter j indicates the presence  or absence  of stress. for any given feature f, we fit the normalized signal yfcjr with the model,

yfcjr = v1f + acv2f + jsf + εfcjr   

where ac is the proportion of m cells in the sample, sf represents the effect of stress on gene expression, r represents the replicate number from  <dig> through  <dig> and f represents the feature number from  <dig> to f, the number of features in the array. in this model, the effect of preparative stress is assumed to act additively and uniformly in both cell types. below, the performance of the model will be assessed with respect to analysis in which the stress effect is not considered.

if we assume there is no contamination of the other cell type for the single cell treatments , the values of a <dig> and a <dig>  are set to be  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in practice, two types of cellular contamination might be recognized. first, a proportion of contaminating m cells will be present in the b prep and of b cells in the m prep. the level of this cross-contamination was estimated at below 5% as determined by semi-quantitative pcr using known markers for b  and m cell identity  . the level of cross-contamination was considered to be sufficiently low as to be ignored, thereby simplifying the model by elimination of v1f and v2f terms in expressions describing m and b, respectively. the values of a <dig> and a <dig> could be adjusted to allow consideration of such contamination if desired. the presence of additional leaf cell types constitutes a second source of cellular contamination, perhaps most notably the inclusion of epidermal and vascular cells. for simplicity and economy, we do not consider this second source of contamination in our model. we estimated the value of a <dig> , by examination of leaf sections and by marker gene expression, at between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . for the analysis presented here, the value of a <dig> was set at  <dig> . the model  can thus be simplified as,

μtbf = v1f  

μtmf = v2f + sf

μttf = /2

μtsf = / <dig> + sf

where μtbf, μtmf, μttf and μtsf represent expected expression levels indexed as appropriate to the four treatments tb, tm, tt and ts for feature f. since not all treatments are observed within the same array, the spot-specific array effect is corrected as a random effect to the model  and estimated by reml  <cit> . the normalized values  for each feature, corresponding to the  <dig> hybridizations, are listed in additional file  <dig> 

two versions of the analysis were performed. first, an analysis as described above was used to generate estimates of  and sf for each feature . second, we repeated the analysis with the stress effect ignored . a second set of estimates of  were calculated and compared with those obtained from the stress model. for both models, the deviation of each  estimate from  <dig> was investigated using a t-statistic. the q-value procedure of storey et al.  <cit>  was used to control the false discovery rate . the estimates of  and sf for the stress model are listed in additional file  <dig> together with their test statistics. the estimates of  obtained from the simple model are listed in additional file  <dig> 

comparison of analyses using the stress and simple models
lists of differentially accumulating features identified by the stress and simple models were compared. under fdr control at the 5% level with q-values ≤  <dig> , the stress model identified  <dig>  differentially accumulating unique features. at the same level of control, the simple model identified  <dig>  unique features.  <dig>  features were common to the gene lists obtained from the two models. therefore, the simple model identified the majority of features identified by the stress model . this is shown graphically in figure 3a. for the features identified by the stress model, the q value obtained from the stress model  is plotted against the q value obtained from the simple model . features are coloured red and blue for predicted m and b enrichment, respectively. the threshold values of q =  <dig>  are shown by dashed lines. among the features identified by the stress model, but not the simple model, were three annotated as components of psii  . previous analyses have shown that psii components predominantly accumulate in the m cells of the maize leaf  <cit> . the failure of the simple model to identify these psii transcripts is consistent with reduction in rna levels associated with m cell preparation. under the stress model, accumulation of all three of these rnas was predicted to be reduced by stress.

although the simple model identified the majority of features identified by the stress model, it also identified many more features in total than the stress model . preliminary microarray analysis of b and m cell types using a simple paired comparison had suggested that one confounding effect of preparation stress might be the mistaken identification of stress induced transcripts as m enriched . among the features predicted to be strongly m enriched only under the simple model were a number annotated as chaperones or heat shock proteins  , a class of transcripts known to be induced by stresses  <cit> . these hsps are shown in green in figure 3b. additional stress-related annotations included a glutathione peroxidase  and a wounding-associated chymotrypsin inhibitor . these hsps and other stress-related features are likely to have been mis-identified as m enriched on the basis of stress-related increases in accumulation. consistent with this interpretation, the stress model predicted that accumulation of all of these transcripts increased following stress.

empirical comparison of simple and stress models demonstrated the requirement for the control of the stress effect and the applicability of our stress model to this problem and is, therefore, the model we have chosen in the analysis of differential gene expression between b and m cells. below, we describe the use of the stress model to identify potentially differentially accumulating transcripts and briefly discuss the resulting gene list.

statistical identification of b and m enriched transcripts using the stress model
the estimate  was calculated for all  <dig>  features passing data filtering. the mean estimate of  was  <dig>  suggesting that the estimates were distributed around a value close to  <dig>  i.e. equivalent expression in b and m cell types. analysis of the distribution of resulting p-values allowed estimation of the proportion of non-differentially expressed genes . using the method of storey et al.,  <cit> , π <dig> was calculated to be  <dig> , corresponding to  <dig>  differentially expressed features from the  <dig>  in the analysis. under fdr control at the 5% level, the model identified  <dig>  candidate features.

annotation of features identified as differentially expressed under fdr control
the majority of features present in the maize array project are designed to est contigs present in the tigr maize sequence database  <cit> . an annotation of the features, based on annotation of the tigr sequences at the time of design, is available at the maize array project website  <cit> . it is important to note that a complete maize genome sequence is not yet available and that current gene models may well change as additional data become available. annotation of oligonucleotide probes is further complicated by difficulty in predicting cross-hybridization between related genes  <cit> . this is especially relevant to a highly polymorphic species such as maize that possesses a highly duplicated genome  <cit> . given these caveats, approximately 50% of the identified features were fully or partially annotated in the maize array project database. of the remainder, approximately 15% were annotated as encoding genes related to hypothetical or unknown arabidopsis or rice proteins, 10% were annotated by similarity to arabidopsis or rice genomic regions and 25% were not annotated. to further investigate the number of unique genes represented by the  <dig>  features, a blast search was used to identify maize sequences in the ncbi non-redundant database homologous to the oligonucleotides. for each feature, the best-matched sequence was recorded. under the search criteria used  <dig>  matches were recovered. of these,  <dig> unique sequences were represented. in addition, tigr rice gene model matches were obtained for  <dig> of the features from the maize array project database. these  <dig> rice matches represent  <dig> independent gene models. this estimate is in line with the original design criteria of the microarray used  <cit> . annotations are included in additional file  <dig> 

validation of candidate gene list using prior knowledge
differential gene expression in b and m cells has been the subject of extensive prior investigation  <cit> . the wealth of previous studies provides a collection of well-characterized marker transcripts that can be used in the preliminary validation of the candidate gene list. in total, we identified approximately  <dig> features as markers considered to provide biological validation of the data set and analysis . data corresponding to a number of these are shown graphically in figure  <dig>  markers were selected on the basis of previous studies and the presence of multiple features representing a gene. for each feature, the ratios of signal intensity  obtained from the  <dig> hybridizations are shown. while variation is evident both between and among features, the overall consistency of behaviour is evident. in all examples shown, strong b or m cell enrichment is predicted in accordance with previous observations.

the enzymes of the c <dig> carbon shuttle are abundant and cell-type specific . previous studies have characterised accumulation of their transcripts by rna gel-blot analysis  <cit> , in situ hybridization  <cit> , real-time pcr  <cit>  and differential screening  <cit> . features corresponding to genes encoding the carbon shuttle enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , malate dehydrogenase , nadp-dependent malic enzyme  and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase  activities are shown in figure  <dig>  although considered markers of c <dig> cell identity, the carbon shuttle enzymes are encoded by members of small gene families that contain both c <dig> and c <dig> isoforms. for example, c4-specific malic enzyme is hypothesized to have arisen following the acquisition of a plastid transit peptide sequence by a gene encoding a cytosolic isoform, followed by duplication and divergence of c <dig> and c <dig> forms  <cit> . consequently, maize contains at least three nadp-me loci  <cit> . the gene zmchlme <dig> encodes a leaf-specific, plastid-targeted isoform required for decarboxylation of malate in b cells  <cit>   while two, nearly identical, me <dig> genes  have been identified that encode cytosolic isoforms  <cit> . at the nucleotide level, zmchlme2a and zmchlme2b are 99% identical to each other and 87% identical to zmchlme <dig>  <cit> . a further nadp-me activity has been characterized from roots and found to be 99% and 98% identical to zmchlme2a and zmchlme2b, respectively  <cit> . gene duplications of this type could pose a serious difficulty in oligonucleotide analysis if features do not discriminate between paralogous gene copies. in the case of the carbon shuttle enzymes, the c <dig> isoforms are typically more abundant than c <dig> isoforms  <cit>  and the accumulation patterns we observed suggest that the signal obtained in our experiment corresponds to c <dig> cell-specific transcripts.

a somewhat different situation is illustrated by the multi-subunit rubisco holoenzyme. here, an enzyme that is abundant in all photosynthetic cell types in the c <dig> plant is restricted to the b in maize, although the biochemical role of the protein remains unchanged. rubisco consists of a number of large  and small  subunits. lsu is encoded by the chloroplast gene rbcl  <cit> , while ssu is encoded by a family of nuclear rbcs genes  <cit> . in maize, both lsu and ssu are restricted to the b cells of mature leaf tissue by regulation of transcript accumulation  <cit> . in this experiment, three features were identified corresponding to rbcs and each showed the expected b enrichment. two additional calvin cycle enzymes, carbonic anhydrase  and phosphoribulokinase  were also represented by multiple features on the array and displayed the predicted b-enriched patterns of expression .

previous gene profiling of leaf cell-types in maize  <cit>  and sorghum  <cit>  have identified a number of metallothionein  genes that are expressed preferentially in b cells. mts are a family of small, metal-ion binding proteins that are found in many taxa and are hypothesized to play important roles in metal tolerance and homeostasis  <cit> . consistent with these studies, we identified a number of b-enriched features corresponding to mt-like proteins . there are three annotated mt genes in maize, designated zmmtl <dig>  <cit> , zmmtl <dig>  <cit>  and zmmtl <dig>  <cit> . although the features we identified showed homology to these genes, the majority were most similar to a non-characterized est sequence  that we tentatively annotate as zmmtl <dig>  the role of mt proteins in the b is not immediately apparent. however, the analysis of nakazono and colleagues  <cit>  suggests an involvement in the functioning of the vasculature.

proteomic analysis of maize b and m chloroplasts has identified β-glucosidase as among the most strongly b-enriched proteins  <cit> . immunocytochemical studies have also demonstrated b enrichment of the major plastidic isoform of β-glucosidase in maize leaves  <cit> . we found six b-enriched features corresponding to β-glucosidase in our candidate gene list. β-glucosidase is proposed to function in plant defence by conversion of hydroxamic acid glucosides to toxic benzoxazolinones  <cit> . in addition, β-glucosidase activity has been implicated in cytokinin signalling  <cit> . although providing a further marker for b identity, the significance of the localization of the enzyme in maize leaves remains unresolved.

in summary, approximately 8%  of the features analysed were identified as accumulating differentially between b and m when fdr is controlled at 5%. approximately 50% of these features were fully or partially annotated by the maize array project database. searching of maize sequences databases suggested that that these features represent at least  <dig> unique genes. an estimate of the overall predicted proportion of differentially accumulating features  suggests that as many as 18% of features may be differentially expressed. approximately  <dig> features identified in our gene list correspond to previously characterized marker genes and provide convincing evidence of the validity of our data set and analysis. below we consider the significance of differential expression in the establishment and potential engineering of the c <dig> syndrome.

general comments on the differentiation of b and m cell types
it is estimated that the c <dig> syndrome has been derived at least  <dig> times in  <dig> families of angiosperms  <cit>  and that a small number of regulatory changes are sufficient to establish a functional c <dig> type  <cit> . by contrast, our observations suggest that differentiation of b and m cell-types in maize involves the cell-specific regulation of many thousands of genes. a number of these differences likely pre-date the acquisition c <dig> photosynthesis. ancestrally, the m would have been the major site of photosynthesis while the b would have had, and presumably retains, functions associated with proximity to the vascular tissue  <cit> . indeed, c <dig> isoforms of certain c4-related enzymes show specialised patterns of accumulation in the leaves of c <dig> plants  <cit> . additionally, a number of c <dig> cell-specific promoters have been shown to be functional when introduced into c <dig> species  <cit> . these observations suggest that spatial information distinguishing b and m also pre-dates the shift to c <dig> 

although it is likely there were ancestral differences between b and m, our data and previous studies suggest that the establishment of the c <dig> syndrome resulted in many additional changes to the accumulation of transcripts within these cell types. we distinguish two modes of regulation that might establish these differences . first, modification of cis-acting elements and the recruitment of transcription factors may directly change patterns of gene expression . studies of c <dig> gene regulation in maize have successfully identified such elements associated with a number of genes  <cit> . although it has been assumed that regulatory changes of this type drive the establishment of the c <dig> state, it appears unlikely that novel regulatory elements could be recruited on the scale required to explain the number of differentially expressed genes we have observed. as a second mechanism, we suggest that pre-existing regulatory mechanisms established in the c <dig> state respond in a cell-specific manner to the creation of novel environments in the c <dig> leaf . the b and m cells of a c <dig> leaf differ in their complement of protein complexes, concentration of sugars, the redox poise of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and the availability of reducing equivalents  <cit> . more broadly, we suggest that a small number of changes in gene expression, when superimposed on ancestral cellular differences, would further induce secondary changes in transcript accumulation and thereby generate the complex pattern we have observed. it should be noted that such a model does not suggest the presence of regulatory 'master-switches' but rather the re-balancing of a complex system in response to key alterations. we have recently initiated transcriptional profiling of maize mutants with defects in phytochrome signalling  <cit> , calvin cycle function  <cit>  and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis  <cit>  to assess the effect of disrupting cellular conditions on cell-specific patterns of gene expression.

engineering c <dig> photosynthesis
the ability to express c4-associated transcripts in c <dig> plants has stimulated interest in the molecular engineering of a c <dig> state in c <dig> plants to achieve high photosynthetic performance and water and nitrogen use efficiencies  <cit> . unfortunately, the physiological effects of over-expressing individual carbon shuttle proteins in c <dig> plants have been limited and difficult to interpret  <cit> . the next steps in c <dig> engineering will require that multiple enzymes be expressed together. to achieve this, knowledge of the mechanisms that coordinate the distribution of activities in the c <dig> leaf will be essential. in addition, an appreciation of the extent of de novo regulation required for the establishment of the c <dig> state will aid the selection of targets for manipulation. many of the most promising attempts to transfer individual c <dig> activities to a c <dig> plant have been achieved by transfer of maize genes to rice  <cit> . similarly, the applicability of information regarding genome wide regulatory events will likely be greatest between closely related species. in this regard, comparative genomic and proteomic studies of maize and rice offer perhaps the greatest potential for understanding the establishment of the c <dig> syndrome.

CONCLUSIONS
differential gene expression was examined in separated b and m cell types from maize leaf blade tissue. to control for stress effects generated during the isolation process we developed a model that includes a stress term and compare the results of the analysis with a model lacking the stress term. these results suggest that gene expression changes are induced during the m cell isolation process and that this confounding effect can be reduced using the stress model. our analysis indicates that 8% of features detected on the maize long-oligonucleotide microarray produced by the maize array project consortium and up to 18% of genes expressed in the leaf transcriptome are differentially expressed between b and m cell types.
