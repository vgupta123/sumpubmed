BACKGROUND
the phytopathogenic enterobacterium, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, is a phytoparasitic, gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacterium  <cit> . pcc produces many extracellular pectic enzymes  and hydrolytic enzymes causing soft-rot disease, tissue maceration, and cell wall collapse  <cit> . the only current strategy against soft-rot disease involves chemical agents that unavoidably contaminate the environment  <cit> . kikumoto et al. have demonstrated that mixed bacteriocin-producing avirulent strains of pcc show high efficacy against soft-rot disease of chinese cabbage  <cit> .

bacteriocins are bactericidal, extracellular toxins, produced by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . these proteinaceous molecules kill closely related bacteria. the susceptible cell is recognized by specific target receptors on the membrane, and the producer cell evades lethality by expressing a cognate immune protein. the colicin family produced by escherichia coli is divided into dnase , rnase , trnase , and pore-forming colicins   <cit> . bacteriocins  have a high amino acid sequence homology.

natural bacteriocin molecules act via a number of mechanisms. for example, colicin e <dig> is a well-known ribonuclease that specifically cleaves 16s rrna at the 3'-end of the coding sequence both in vivo and in vitro, which leads to the abolishment of protein synthesis resulting in death of the susceptible cell  <cit> . previous reports indicate that colicin e <dig> consists of a killer protein with three domains  and an immunity protein that retards antibiotic activity  <cit> . the r domain recognizes a specific receptor, btub on the cell membrane and the t domain interacts with the tolb protein in the cell periplasm of the sensitive cell to facilitate entry of the killer domain through the cell membrane. in addition to the attack mechanism, the immunity mechanism has been extensively elucidated. notably the immunity protein and the killer protein interact initially at very high affinity because of charge attraction, and are separated at the cell surface through energy generated from the proton motif force  <cit> .

in general, the c-terminal domain determines the type of bacteriocin. the c-terminal nuclease domains are not only interchangeable but also lack species specificity  <cit> . strikingly, the trnase type of bacteriocin may accelerate exhaustion of trna in the cytoplasmic pool and thereby impair protein synthesis in vivo. ogawa et al. have demonstrated that particular trna molecules can be digested by colicin d as well as by colicin e <dig>  <cit> . it has been suggested that phage-associated klebicin d is a trnase type of bacteriocin based on similarity to the nuclease-like domain of colicin d  <cit> .

nguyen et al. reported production of a high-molecular-weight bacteriocin  and chuang et al. reported production of a low-molecular-weight bacteriocin  by pectobacterium <cit> . the former has a bulky antenna-like tail, inner core, and contractile cylindrical structure, and the carotovoricin-caused inhibition zone can be easily distinguished from that of carocin by its low diffusibility. carocin s <dig> is a deoxyribonuclease type of lmwb  and is secreted by pcc strain 89-h- <dig>  additionally, export of carocin s <dig> utilizes the type iii secretion system in pcc, which also controls the cell motility of the bacterium  <cit> .

pcc strain f-rif- <dig> is a spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutant of the wild-type 3f- <dig>  ultraviolet radiation can induce pcc strain f-rif- <dig> to produce the lmwb carocin s <dig>  one of several sensitive cells, sp <dig>  was selected as an indicator strain here. in the present study, the chromosomal bacteriocin gene, carocin s <dig>  was introduced into an expression plasmid encoding two proteins, caros2k and caros2i. these proteins were purified and characterized and their primary activities of killing  and immunity  were investigated in vivo and in vitro.

RESULTS
isolation of transposon insertion mutants
conjugation between f-rif- <dig> and e. coli  <dig> resulted in ~ <dig>  colonies after selection on modified drigalski's agar medium containing rifampin and kanamycin. in bacteriocin assay, the size of the inhibition zone around each isolate was compared with that of f-rif- <dig>  mutant colonies were identified by smaller inhibition zones. this evidence of mutation suggested that transposon tn <dig> had been inserted into lmw bacteriocin-related genes. the strain tf1- <dig>  a putative insertion mutant, would no longer produce lmw bacteriocin .

to ascertain whether tn <dig> was actually introduced into the genomic dna of putative isolates, the nptii gene of isolates was amplified using two primers p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . southern blot technology showed that tn <dig> had been inserted .

identification of tn5-inserted dna structures
to identify tn5-interrupted genes, genomic dna from tf1- <dig> was amplified with tail-pcr using an array of specific primers . a 2621-bp dna fragment, including two open reading frames , was identified as the sequence containing the bacteriocin structural gene. this gene was designated the carocin s <dig> gene. to characterize the carocin s <dig> gene, the tf1- <dig> probe was designed to hybridize in southern blots with a bam hi-digested dna fragment from the genomic library of f-rif- <dig> . a 5706-bp bam hi-digested dna fragment , harboring two complete orfs of carocin s <dig>  was cloned into the plasmid pmcl <dig> . the carocin-producing plasmid was designated as pms2ki. the amplicon, comprising the predicted orf <dig> of caros2i, was subcloned into the pgem-t easy vector, resulting in the plasmid pgs2i .

transcriptional analysis and in vivo expression of carocin s <dig> gene
to determine whether the carocin s <dig> gene is transcribed in a series of recombinant strains, reverse transcription-pcr was used to estimate rna level. two sets of intergenic primers were designed to amplify parts of transcripts from caros2k or caros2i, respectively . amplification of parts of 16s ribosomal rna transcripts indicated that rna in these bacterial cells is expressed at normal levels .

the presence of the 925-bp amplicon revealed that caros2k was being transcribed in the cell . the tf1- <dig> strain, which is a tn <dig> insertional mutant, could not transcribe caros2k , but the ability of tf1- <dig> to transcribe caros2k was restored by introduction of pms2ki . it was apparent that the amount of caros2k expression was dependent on the number of copies of plasmid pms2ki . additionally, carocin s <dig> can be expressed in e. coli strain dh5α by introduction of pms2ki .

the presence of a 259-bp amplicon showed that caros2i was transcribed constitutively . the caros2i gene was transcribed unexpectedly in mutant strain tf1- <dig> even though the plasmid pms2ki was introduced . this demonstrated that caros2i is expressed constitutively regardless of whether the gene caros2k is transcribed. possibly an individual promoter for caros2i gene is located behind the tn <dig> insertion site in the caros2k gene. caros2i transcripts were detected in strain sp <dig> with plasmid pgs2i . although both the sp <dig> strains  were susceptible to carocin s <dig>  sp33/pgs2i appeared to grow in the presence of caros2k .

to prove that pms2ki contained the gene for carocin s <dig>  pms2ki was introduced into tf1- <dig> and e. coli dh5α. both tf1-2/pms2ki and dh5α/pms2ki had ability to express the activity of carocin s <dig> . the size of inhibition zone around strain tf1-2/pms2ki was equal to that around dh5α/pms2ki but still smaller than that around the wild-type strain f-rif- <dig>  on the other hand, the quantity of transcripts expressed in vivo and in vitrodid not usually correspond.

deduction of the amino acid sequence of carocin s2
the carocin s <dig> gene consists of two orfs : one containing the 2352-bp caros2k gene and the other containing the 273-bp caros2i gene. the stop codon  of caros2k overlaps the first start codon of caros2i by 4-bp . the amino sequences were deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the carocin s <dig> gene using dnasis-mac software  and compared to other analogous proteins using the blast and fasta search tools.

orf <dig> was found to encode a 783-amino acid protein with a high degree of homology to pcc <dig> carocin d, escherichia coli colicin d and klebsiella oxytoca klebicin d ; orf <dig> was found to encode a 90-amino acid protein that shows homology to the immunity proteins of colicin d and klebicin d . thus, caros2k produces an antibiotic with a deduced molecular mass of  <dig> kda. caros2i  was shown to confer resistance to caros2k. it is particularly noteworthy that the homology between caros2k and colicin d and klebicin d is at the c-terminal end of these proteins where the catalytic center of a ribonuclease is located. according to the fasta program, the amino acid segment between asp <dig> and the c-terminus of caros2k shares almost 60% similarity with the minimal trnase domain of colicin d and klebicin d . since the colicin d and klebicin d are well-known trnase family of bacteriocins, suggests that carocin s <dig> might therefore be a ribonuclease.

purification and characterization of carocin s2
e. coli bl <dig>  recombinants, which were transformed with pes2ki or pes2i, were used to express caros2k protein or caros2i protein individually. coomassie blue stained sds-page gels of purified carocin s <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  the band corresponding to caros2k was purified. the gel indicates a relative mass  of about  <dig> kda , enrichment of the purified caros2k , and disappearance of other bands. purification of caros2i by the same procedure resulted in a more intense band in the region of mr  <dig> kda .

the purified caros2k involved in the growth inhibition of the susceptible indicator strain sp <dig> was then characterized. the number of viable cells decreased with increasing concentration of caros2k . almost all cells were dead at the initial concentration of  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  indicating that about 90% of indicator strains are killed at this concentration. however, the activity of caros2k was inhibited by trypsin, but not inhibited by caros2i.

carocin s <dig> has ribonuclease activity
in order to confirm the role of carocin s <dig> as a ribonuclease type bacteriocin, we set up a rna degradation assay. northern blots of 5'-32p-labeled total rna extract treated with increasing concentrations of caros2k  showed a markedly lower intensity of labeled rna fragments compared to untreated extracted rna , suggesting that caros2k has ribonuclease activity.

surprisingly the rna segments were larger when the rna was 3'-32p-labeled compared with 5'-32p-labeling . as the concentrations of 23s rna and 16s rna decrease on the addition of increasing concentrations of caros2k, it is assumed that more ribosomal rna is degraded leaving material that is ostensibly the ribosome. when excess concentrations of caros2k  are added then most of the ribosomal rna is degraded leading to a destabilization and subsequent degradation of the ribosome . we hence consider that caros2k  would degrade the ribosome. caros2i inhibits the killing activity of caros2k because a mixture of equal quantities of caros2k and caros2i prevented digestion of rna segments by caros2k .

subsequently, treatment of the genomic dna of the indicator strain sp <dig> with the purified caros2k protein had no effect on deoxyribonuclease activity, as compared to the pattern of ecori-digested genomic dna .

the genbank accession number of the sequence of the carocin s <dig> gene is hm <dig> 

discussion
in this study, a chromosome-borne gene encoding bacteriocin, carocin s <dig>  in pcc strain 3f <dig> was shown to possess ribonuclease activity. according to bradley's classification, carocin s <dig> is a low-molecular-weight bacteriocin  <cit> . two genes, caros2k and caros2i, encode the 85-kda and 10-kda components, respectively, of carocin s <dig>  the substrate and gene structure of carocin s <dig> were unlike those of other bacteriocins from pcc.

on the basis of sequence analysis, carocin s <dig> comprises these two overlapping orfs, caros2k and caros2i . a putative shine-dalgarno sequence 5'-augga-3', which has also been seen in the dna sequence of carocin s <dig>  is located upstream  of the start codon aug, suggesting that it could be a ribosome binding site for caros2k  <cit> . comparison of the upstream sequences of both caros2k and caros2i has shown that the two consensus sequences, 5'-tataaaaa-3'  and 5'-gaagt-3' , are both upstream from the start codon. presumably, 5'-tataaaaa-3' is the - <dig> promoter and 5'-gaagt-3' is the - <dig> promoter for the carocin s <dig> gene, even though they differ from those of e. coli <cit> .

a putative - <dig> promoter is  <dig> bp upstream from the initiator atg of the caros2k gene, in which the sd sequence is embedded, while the - <dig> promoter is  <dig> bp upstream of the - <dig> promoter region. the putative promoter of the - <dig> box of caros2i is located similarly near the - <dig> box, but the - <dig> box is just  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon where no sd sequence is apparent. although those hypothesized promoters are located within the caros2k structural gene, transcripts of caros2i are routinely produced . this suggests that caros2i rna expression may be regulated posttranscriptionally, in spite of close neighboring genes downstream of the gene caros2k; that is, core promoter elements may influence the expression of caros2i gene.

in the present study, we attempted to separate caros2k from caros2i attached to 6-tag using a nickel column , but a small amount of caros2i  was observed in sds-page gels , which had little influence on the activity of caros2k as the purified protein still had transient killing activity. additionally, the activity of the carocin s <dig> complex at 4℃ was long-lasting indicating good stability.

the c-terminal amino acid sequence of carocin s <dig> had higher homology to those of colicin d and klebicin d, which are produced by e. coli and klebsiella oxytoca, respectively, than to the amino acid sequence of carocin s <dig> from the same species .

the amino acid sequence of caros2k has three putative domains. domain i  is regarded as the translocation domain and is homologous to the translocation domains of carocin d and colicin e <dig> . it is assumed to direct the cytotoxic domain to the periplasmic space  <cit> . additionally, the putative tonb box  was found in the n-terminal domain of carocins <dig>  which is thought to participate in bacteriocin translocation  <cit> . thus, we suggested that carocin s <dig> could be a tonb-dependent bacteriocin.

domain iii  is the killer domain. particularly noteworthy is the resemblance of the killer domain to the trnase domain of colicin d and klebicin d , and thus we suggested that carocin s <dig> might have trnase activity  <cit> . domain ii extends  <dig> residues from ilu <dig> to val <dig> and is hypothesized to be the binding site that recognizes specific receptors on cell membranes. additionally, domain iii has no significant homology to carocin d, suggesting that carocin s <dig> and carocin d have different functions  <cit> .

finally, we showed that total rna  is sensitive to carocin s <dig>  carocin s <dig> degraded 5'-labeled total rna but not 5'-labeled caros2k-free rna , and the amount of degradation was not dose-dependent . however, the appearance of segments of unknown origin paralleled partial degradation of 23s and 16s rrna . these results suggest that the site of excision  is close to the 5'-terminus of rrna. notably, the decrease in the amount of rrna depended on the amount of carocin s <dig> protein present, with complete degradation occurring in the presence of excess carocin s <dig>  ogawa et al. reported that rnase type of bacteriocins, colicin e <dig> and colicin e <dig>  catalyze the hydrolysis of the shorter rnas from 16s rrna  <cit> . moreover, colicin e <dig> was found to hydrolyze trna in vitro. furthermore, it was previously reported that colicin e <dig> cleaved 16s rrna completely, and even 30s rrna  <cit> . in our study, carocin s <dig> acted as an rnase that hydrolyzes rrna  in vitro. in terms of enzymatic function, carocin s <dig> may act as an endo- and exo-ribonuclease simultaneously. moreover, caros2i significantly inhibited nuclease activity in vitro but not in vivo . we speculated that immunity protein caros2i might not be able to cross the cell membrane, as previously described  <cit> . although our in vitro experiment showed that carocin s <dig> was a ribonuclease, further investigation is needed to clarify its function in cells.

one of the other tn <dig> insertional mutants, tf1- <dig>  which disrupted the coding sequence of the flic gene, was found to halt expression of carocin s <dig> , indicating that carocin s <dig> can also be secreted via the type iii secretion system  <cit> . the role of carocin s <dig> as an rnase in the cytoplasm is to prevent protein synthesis by cleaving either 23s rrna or 16s rrna. the role of the immunity protein, caros2i, is usually to stop the damage caused by caros2k in the cytoplasm. more details of the actual mechanism of carocin s <dig> remain to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
as shown herein, the novel bacteriocin, carocin s <dig>  was characterized as a ribonuclease. it is the first bacteriocin with ribonuclease activity to be found in pectobacterium strains. we suggested that carocin s <dig> kills the indicator cell by exhausting its supply of some kinds of rna, leading to inactivation of protein biosynthesis. it will be of interest to study the proteomics of carocin s <dig> and its mechanism of action in the future.
