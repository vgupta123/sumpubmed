BACKGROUND
the classification of protein structures often rely on the topology of secondary structural elements. for example, the structural classification of proteins  system classifies proteins structures into common folds using the topological arrangement of secondary structural units  <cit> . most protein structural alignment methods can reliably classify proteins into similar folds given the structural units from each protein are in the same sequential order. however, the evolutionary possibility of proteins with different structural topology but with similar spatial arrangement of their secondary structures pose a problem. one such possibility is the circular permutation.

a circular permutation is an evolutionary event that results in the n and c terminus transferring to a different position on a protein. figure  <dig> <cit>  shows a simplified example of circular permutation. there are three proteins, all consist of three domains . although the spatial arrangement of the three domains are very similar, the ordering of the domains in the primary sequence has been circularly permuted. lindqvist et. al. observed the first natural occurrence of a circular permutation between jackbean concanavalin a and favin  <cit> . although the jackbean-favin permutation was the result of post-translational ligation of the n and c terminus and cleavage elsewhere in the chain, a circular permutation can arise from events at the gene level through gene duplication and exon shuffling.

permutation by duplication  <cit>  is a widely accepted model where a gene first duplicates and fuses. after fusion, a new start codon is inserted into one gene copy while a new stop codon is inserted into the second copy. peisajovich et al. demonstrated the evolutionary feasibility of permutation via duplication by creating functional intermediates at each step of the permutation by duplication model for dna methyltransferases  <cit> . identifying structurally similar proteins with different chain topologies, including circular permutation, can aid studies in homology modeling, protein folding, and protein design. an algorithm that can structurally align two proteins independent of their backbone topologies would be an important tool.

the biological implications of thermodynamically stable and biologically functional circular permutations, both natural and artificial, has resulted in much interest in detecting circular permutations in proteins  <cit> . the more general problem of detecting non-topological structural similarities beyond circular permutation has received less attention. we refer to these as non-cyclic permutations from now on. tabtiang et al. were able to create a thermodynamically stable and biologically functional non-cyclic permutation, indicating that non-cyclic permutations may be as important as circular permutations  <cit> . in this study, we present a novel method that detects spatially similar structures that can identify structures related by circular and more complex non-cyclic permutations. detection of non-cyclic permutation is possible by our algorithm by virtue of a recursive combination of a local-ratio approach with a global linear-programming formulation. this paper is organized as follows. we first show that our algorithm is capable of finding known circular permutations with sensitivity and specificity. we then report the discovery of three new circular permutations and one example of a non-cyclic permutation that to our knowledge have not been reported in literature. we conclude with remarks and discussions.

RESULTS
for availability of our alignment software please see  <cit> .

detection of known circular permutations
we first demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to detect circular permutations by examining known examples of circular permutations. the results are summarized in table  <dig> and table  <dig> 

comparison of results against dalilite and k <dig>  dalilite is not expected to find sequence order independent alignments. k <dig> did not find the circular permutation even when the sequence order independent options was selected.

comparison of our alignment results with that of mass, opaas, samo, and topofit for known circular permutations. each method detected the circular permutations. our method normally returns more equivalent residues at a lower rmsd. n indicates the number of aligned residues. an * next to the number of aligned residues indicates that a circular permutation was found. r indicates the crmsd of the alignment. p indicates the p-value of our alignment.

in table  <dig> we compare results against dalilite and k <dig>  as expected, dalilite returned the largest sequential alignment. k <dig> did not find circular permutations even when the option to ignore sequence order constraints was selected.

in table  <dig> we compare our alignment results to the methods of mass  <cit> , opaas  <cit> , samo  <cit> , and topofit  <cit> . each method is able to detect circular permutations. however, table  <dig> shows that our method normally finds more equivalent residues with a lower rmsd. compared with samo our method found less aligned residues in  <dig> of the  <dig> shown alignments. however, our crmsd values are considerably better. at the time of this writing, samo only outputs the crmsd and the number of equivalent residues  of the alignment, without specifying the residue equivalence relationships between the two aligned protein structures. this makes it difficult to compare the quality of the alignments. table  <dig> shows that our method finds better alignments in terms of crmsd than other structural alignment methods when the two proteins are related by a circular permutation.

the gansta method by kolbeck et al  <cit>  can also align similar structures independent of the connectivity. the approach is somewhat similar to the blast method in sequence alignment, where a set of seeds of high-similarity pairs of secondary structural elements  are first identified, and are then aligned through a genetic algorithm, regardless of the connectivity.

the scali method by yuan and bystroff  <cit>  assembles from a library of gapless alignment of fragments of local sequence-structure hierarchically, enforcing compactness and conserved contacts, but disregard the sequence ordering of the fragments. the aligned local fragments are then incremented by adding a new fragment pair. this process is organized as a tree, where nodes corresponds to the addition of new fragments. a breadth-first tree search method was then carried out, with a number of heuristic conditions to limit the search space.

instead of only aligning regular sse fragments, our method differs from gansta and has no restriction on spatial patterns belonging to a regular sse, and therefore is also applicable to loop regions. our method differs from scali in that our fragments are not prebuilt, but are exhaustive fragments ranging from size 4– <dig>  compared to both methods, our method provides a guaranteed optimal ratio of aligned structures, whereas the heuristics employed by gansta and scali cannot guarantee that a good alignment can be found, and when an alignment is found, there is no guarantee that it will be within a certain ratio of the best possible alignment. in practice, we find that gansta often requires 3– <dig> hours for aligning a pair of proteins, and sometimes no results are returned. in contrast, our method usually terminates between  <dig> seconds –  <dig> minutes. the scali website consists of pre-computed results of aligned structures and does not allow user input for a customized alignment, therefore it is difficult to compare performance of our method with scali on the examples reported in table  <dig> 

discovery of novel circular permutations and a novel non-cyclic permutation
the effectiveness of our method is also demonstrated by the discovery of previously unknown circular permutations. in an attempt to test our algorithm's ability to discover new circular permutations, we structurally aligned a subset of  <dig>  structures from pdbselect 90%  <cit> . we first selected proteins from pdbselect <dig>  whose n and c termini were no further than 30Å apart. from this subset of  <dig>  proteins, we aligned two proteins if they met the following conditions: the difference in their lengths was no more than  <dig> residues, and they had approximately the same secondary structure content. to compare secondary structure content, we determined the percentage of the residues labeled as helix, strand, and other for each structure. two structures were considered to have the same secondary structure content if the difference between each secondary structure label was less than 10%. within the approximately  <dig>  alignments, we found  <dig> candidate circular permutations. of these circular permutations,  <dig> were symmetric proteins that can be aligned with or without a circular permutation. of the  <dig> non-symmetric circular permutations,  <dig> were already known in literature, and  <dig> are novel. we describe these three novel circular permutations as well as a novel non-cyclic permutation in some details.

nucleoplasmin-core and auxin binding protein
the first novel circular permutation we found was between the nucleoplasmin-core protein in xenopu laevis   <cit>  and the auxin binding protein in maize   <cit> . the overall structural alignment between 1k5je  and 1lrha  has an rmsd value of  <dig> Å with an alignment length of  <dig> residues and a significant p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> after bonferroni correction. these proteins are related by a circular permutation. the short loop connecting two antiparallel strands in nucleoplasmin-core protein  becomes disconnected in auxin binding protein  <dig> , and the n- and c- termini of the nucleoplasmin-core protein  are connected in auxin binding protein  <dig> .

aspartate racemase and type ii 3-dehydrogenate dehyrdalase
another circular permutation we found is between the aspartate racemase   <cit>  and type ii 3-dehydrogenate dehydralase   <cit> . the overall structural alignment between 1iu9a  and 1h0ra  has an rmsd value of  <dig> Å with an alignment length of  <dig> residues and a significant p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> after bonferroni correction. these proteins are related by a circular permutation. the loop connecting the first helix with the first strand in aspartate racemase  becomes disconnected in 3-dehydrogenate dehydralase , while the n- and c-termini of the aspartate racemase  are connected in the dehydralase by an insertion  . figure 3c depicts the topology of these two proteins.

migration inhibition factor and arginine repressor
the majority of circular permutations maintain their overall three dimensional structures. however, it is possible that additional structural changes may occur beyond circular permutation. we have discovered a novel circular permutation between the microphage migration inhibition factor  and the c-terminal domain of arginine repressor   <cit> , which contains in addition to circular permutation a spatial swapping of two antiparallel strands, and a change in the orientation of a helix. the overall folds of these two protein are different by the scop definition. the mif factor belongs to the tautomerase fold, and the c-terminal domain of arginine repressor belongs to the dcoh-like fold. the overall structural alignment between 1uiz chain a  and 1xxa chain c  has an rmsd value of  <dig> Å between  <dig> residues, with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> after bonferroni correction. they are related by a circular permutation. the short loop of mif  connecting the first helix and the second strand from the n-terminus becomes disconnected in arginine repressor . the relaxing of spatial constraints imposed by the connection allows strand  <dig> of mif to swap positions with strand  <dig> of mif. this can also be clearly seen in figure 4a, where a strand colored in red  swaps position with the strand colored in blue . although the strands have changed positions spatially, their topology remains the same . the circular permutation and strand swapping cause additional structural changes. in mif, helix  <dig> was connected with a short loop to strand  <dig> . with the creation of the new n- and c-termini replacing the original short loop , helix  <dig> loses the spatial constraints imposed by the connection, and was pulled over when strand  <dig> and strand  <dig> swap positions. the net results for helix  <dig> is that its orientation in arginine repressor  is almost perpendicular to its original orientation in mif .

beyond circular permutation
the information that naturally occurring circular permutations contain about the folding mechanism of proteins has led to a lot of interest in their detection. another interesting class of permuted proteins is the non-cyclic permutation. although there has been previous work on the detection of non-cyclic permutations  <cit> , compared to cyclic-permutations there has been relatively little research of noncyclic-permutations. as an example of this important class of topologically permuted proteins, tabtiang et al  were able to artificially create a noncyclic permutation of the arc repressor that was thermodynamically stable, refolds on the sub-millisecond time scale, and binds operator dna with nanomolar affinity  <cit> . this raises the question of whether or not these non-cyclic permutations can arise naturally. here we report the discovery of a possibly naturally occurring non-cyclic permutation between chain f of aml1/core binding factor  and chain a of riboflavin synthase   <cit> . the two structures align well with a rmsd of  <dig>  Å with an alignment length of  <dig> residues, and a significant p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> after bonferroni correction. the topology diagram of aml1/cbf  can be transformed into the topology diagram of riboflavin synthase  by the following steps: remove the the loops connecting strand  <dig> to helix  <dig>  strand  <dig> to strand  <dig>  and strand  <dig> to strand  <dig> . connect the c-terminal end of strand  <dig> to the original n-termini . connect the c-terminal end of strand  <dig> to the n-terminal end of helix  <dig> . connect the original c-termini to the n-terminal end of strand  <dig>  the n-terminal end of strand  <dig> becomes the new n-termini and the c-terminal end of strand  <dig> becomes the new c-termini .

algorithm comparison
zhu et al  demonstrated the quality of their structural alignment algorithm  by comparing their alignments with manually curated alignments in the homstrad database  <cit> . as of march  <dig>  homstrad contains  <dig>  proteins structures in  <dig>  families. we randomly chose  <dig> structures from families that consisted of more than  <dig> protein structures. within each family, we compared the structures using our alignment method to determine accuracy. within alignments, our method's predicted equivalent residues agreed with homstrad 93% of the time. discrepancies occur normally when our method would shift a fragment pair by one or two residues along the backbone. zhu et al. chose  <dig> representatives from different structural classes as examples . table  <dig> is a representation of table iv from  <cit>  comparing our results with that of fast  <cit>  and dalilite  <cit> . in all alignments, our method found sequentially ordered alignments, therefore, there is no bias in favor of our sequence order independent method. it can be seen from table  <dig> that the equivalent residues that our method predicts are consistent with the manually determined residues of homstrad.

table iv from zhu et al.  with the addition of our alignment results. zhu et al. chose the following alignment examples to cover a broad range of structural classes. for each alignment, our method returned sequence ordered alignments. n is the number of aligned residues corresponding to each method and m% is the number of aligned residues generated by the corresponding algorithm that are equivalent to homstrad's aligned residues.

CONCLUSIONS
the approximation algorithm introduced in this work can find good solutions for the problem of protein structure alignment. furthermore, this algorithm can detect topological differences between two spatially similar protein structures. the alignment between mif and the arginine repressor demonstrates our algorithm's ability to detect structural similarities even when spatial rearrangement of structural units has occurred. in addition, we report in this study the finding of a naturally occurring non-cyclic permuted protein between aml1/core binding factor chain f and riboflavin synthase chain a.

in our method, the scoring function plays a pivotal role in detecting substructure similarity of proteins. we expect future experimentation on optimizing the parameters used in our similarity scoring system can improve detection of topologically independent structural alignment. in this study, we were able to fit our scoring system to an extreme value distribution , which allowed us to perform an automated search for circular permuted proteins. although the p-value obtained from our evd fit is sufficient for determining the biological significance of a structural alignment, the structural change between the microphage migration inhibition factor and the c-terminal domain of arginine repressor  indicates a need for a similarity score that does not bias heavily towards crmsd measure for scoring circular permutations.

whether naturally occurring circular permutations are frequent events in the evolution of protein genes is currently an open question. lindqvist et al.  pointed out that when the primary sequences have diverged beyond recognition, circular permutations may still be found using structural methods  <cit> . in this study, we discovered three examples of novel circularly permuted protein structures and a non-cyclic permutation among  <dig>  protein structural alignments for a set of non-redundant  <dig>  proteins. this is an incomplete study, as we restricted our studies to proteins whose n- and c- termini distance were less than 30Å. we plan to relax the n to c distance and include more proteins in future work to expand the scope of the investigation.
