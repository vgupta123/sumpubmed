BACKGROUND
alzheimer's disease  has several well-characterized post-mortem pathological markers that include both gliosis and dystrophic neurites surrounding extracellular amyloid plaques. in addition, intracellular tangles of hyper-phosphorylated tau and massive neurodegeneration are seen later in the disease process. mutated forms of both amyloid precursor protein  and presenilin  <dig>  lead to an increased rate of amyloid deposition and therefore an earlier onset of the dementia associated with ad  <cit> . doubly transgenic mice expressing these human mutants of the app  <cit>  and ps <dig>  <cit>  genes  in aged, memory deficient app+ps <dig> mice  <cit> . increased neural activity during learning is argued to be a primary inducing stimulus for these iegs  <cit> . one possible mechanism to describe this phenomenon would be that amyloid is diminishing the ability of neurons to facilitate sufficient electrical signaling to induce changes in synaptic plasticity essential for memory consolidation. here we present evidence that in addition to decreased expression of na+/k+ atpase mrna as previously described  <cit> , the activity of this enzyme is significantly decreased in the app+ps <dig> hippocampus but not in the amyloid-free cerebellum. perhaps not surprisingly ouabain, an na+/k+ atpase inhibitor, has been shown to impair memory consolidation  <cit> . we decided to investigate further the interactions of aβ and na+/k+ atpase activity to understand better the potential role of this enzyme in ad and memory dysfunction.

RESULTS
we used the app+ps <dig> transgenic mouse model to better understand how the deposition of amyloid contributes to the consistent memory loss seen in these animals  <cit> . specifically, we have found that na+/k+ atpase, a protein critical for not only brain function, but survival, is adversely affected by the presence of amyloid and this interaction may be driving a major pathological event in the progression of amyloid-associated dementia.

in order to determine if our early observation regarding reduced mrna for na+/k+ atpase was functionally meaningful, we measured total and ouabain-sensitive atpase activity in app+ps <dig> brain homogenates compared to those from non-transgenic littermates using a standard colorimetric assay. using ouabain as a selective inhibitor of na+/k+ atpase, we demonstrated that the specific enzymatic activity was significantly reduced by ~25% in the hippocampi of aged, memory-deficient app+ps <dig> mice compared with non-transgenic littermates . the percent reduction in total atpase activity was similar to that of specific na+/k+ atpase activity, suggesting that inhibition of is selective for na+/k+ atpase . in addition, approximately 40% of all the atp hydrolysis found in the homogenate was ouabain sensitive, confirming that this enzyme is likely the largest single site of atp hydrolysis in brain. the specific activity values measured here were consistent with those reported  <dig> decades ago by stefanovic et al.  <cit> , testifying to the robustness of the assay method. upon analysis of the cerebellum of these mice, we found that the specific enzyme activity in app+ps <dig> transgenics remained equivalent to that in non-transgenic littermates ; however the overall activity of na+/k+ atpase in this region was only one fifth of that in the hippocampus . western blot analyses of cortical homogenates demonstrated a trend for reduced protein expression, a finding that would be expected based upon the mrna analyses .

immunohistochemical staining for the na+/k+ atpase αiii subunit was performed using saggital sections from non-transgenic and app+ps <dig> mice. specific staining was observed throughout the forebrain. the specificity of the na+/k+ atpase α subunit antibody used for immunochemistry was determined by pre-incubation of the antibody with purified na+/k+ atpase protein, which dramatically reduced apparent immunostaining  compared with normal staining . positive reaction product appeared to be localized to the periphery of cellular profiles in ca <dig> of the hippocampus  and the insular cortex , consistent with the enzyme's membrane-association. throughout the brain, the white matter regions appeared to have less intense staining, than the neuropil, consistent with the larger numbers of ions crossing the membrane in post-synaptic potentials than action potentials . additionally, regions with high densities of neuronal somata also appeared to have less dense staining, reflecting the greater density of membrane area in dendritic than somatic regions of neuropil. similar observations have been made using  ouabain to mark na+/k+ atpase distribution in brain  <cit>  another striking observation from images of the hippocampus in non-transgenic mice  demonstrate a decreased intensity of staining along the dentate granule cell projection pathways within the hilus and along the mossy fiber projections to ca <dig> . this can also be observed at higher magnification in figure 3a, where there is reduced staining to the left of the somatic staining in the inner molecular layer. although not commented upon, this too can be observed in micrographs of  ouabain autoradiography  <cit> .

cortical staining  revealed a fairly uniform pattern, with the exclusion of white matter. the difference in na+/k+ atpase staining between non-transgenic and app+ps <dig> forebrain areas is the absence of staining where amyloid plaques are present in the app+ps <dig> mice . subsequent congo red staining of these amyloid plaques confirmed that the loss of na+/k+ atpase staining was not only present in the center of the plaque, but also in a penumbral zone immediately surrounding the congophilic material, resulting in a "halo" . higher power magnification clearly demonstrated the lack of na+/k+ atpase staining surrounding the congophilic plaques .

these findings led us to postulate that the osmotic imbalance brought on by an absence or inhibition of na+/k+ atpase may contribute to the swelling associated with dystrophic neurites found in the vicinity of congophilic plaques in app+ps <dig> mice and ad patients. we designed a dual immunostain utilizing immunohistochemical methods for na+/k+ atpase and immunofluorescence methods for phosphorylated neurofilament, a dystrophic neurite marker we evaluated earlier  <cit> . using this assay, we were able to demonstrate that the dystrophic neurites were almost exclusively present within the zone surrounding the congophilic plaque that lacked na+/k+ atpase staining. this is represented in a triple staining overlay of the fluorescent neurites from figure 4c onto the bright field image of na+/k+ atpase and congo red staining from figure 4b . the arrows in figure 4c demarcate where dystrophic neurites are present.

finally, to determine whether amyloid could inactivate na+/k+ atpase activity, we measured the activity of purified cerebral na+/k+ atpase after exposure to various concentrations of aβ 1– <dig> peptide in a dmso+water suspension or a dmso+neutralized hcl suspension. figure  <dig> demonstrates that increasing concentrations of the dmso+water aβ soluble preparation dose-dependently reduced na+/k+ atpase activity, whereas the fibrillar aβ preparation suspended in dmso+neutralized hcl did not demonstrate the same effect. there were significant reductions in na+/k+ atpase activity at the lower concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml compared to vehicle, but maximal reductions were at the highest concentration of the dmso+water aβ suspension .

discussion
over the past  <dig> years, our group has characterized various aspects of the app+ps <dig> transgenic mice including their pathology, behavior, and gene expression. with age, these mice progressively develop more amyloid plaques surrounded by dystrophic neurites, activated microglia and astrocytes  <cit> . with increasing amyloid burden, aged animals consistently develop memory deficits in the radial arm water maze  while na+/k+ atpase activity in the amyloid-free cerebellum remained unperturbed with respect to genotype. cerebellar activity was substantially lower than that seen in the non-transgenic hippocampal tissue, perhaps indicative of the abundant white matter found in this region, where na+/k+ atpase activity is low. these data demonstrate that the function of na+/k+ atpase is perturbed in a brain region that contains high overall concentrations of aβ.

previous investigations have shown that na+/k+ atpase protein levels are decreased in ad tissue but not in normal aged tissue  <cit> , but it is difficult to dissociate the loss due to neuronal death from any loss caused directly by aβ inhibition. this demonstration that reduced activity along with a trend for reduced protein levels can be determined in homogenates from animal models of amyloid deposition argues that at least some of this loss in ad brain is associated with direct actions of aβ. in vitro data suggests that na+/k+ atpase activity can be blocked directly by various aβ peptide fragments in cultured neurons  <cit>  and that even the purified enzyme can be inhibited by high concentrations of aβ .

when we immunostained transgenic mouse tissue to visualize the distribution of na+/k+ atpase alpha iii subunits we found that in areas where congophilic plaque staining was apparent, na+/k+ atpase staining was absent, and more specifically, there appeared to be no or little na+/k+ atpase staining in a penumbral zone surrounding the plaques stained with congo red . while most immunostaining protocols detect voids at the sites where congophilic plaques are located, these areas appeared somewhat larger in the na+/k+ atpase immunostained sections. this led us to speculate about that a reduction in the activity of this extremely important enzyme may have severe impacts on the functions of neurons in the vicinity of the deposits.

we knew from previous studies that dystrophic neurites could be visualized surrounding amyloid plaques in the app+ps <dig> mice. and we have demonstrated previously that proteins such as synaptophysin and app are in fact increased in dystrophic neurites  <cit> . therefore, we decided to stain sections for na+/k+ atpase and dystrophic neurites, along with amyloid plaques using congo red, to determine whether na+/k+ atpase was absent from these neurites and in their immediate vicinity. we found empirically that staining the atpase with a peroxidase label and the phosphorylated neurofilament with a fluorescein label to detect dystrophic neurites was the most effective way to see both markers on the same section along with the congo red stained plaques. imaging of these sections revealed that dystrophic neurites are in the circumferential area surrounding the congophilic amyloid plaques where na+/k+ atpase staining is absent .

one possible explanation for this putative relationship would be that aβ associated inhibition of na+/k+ atpase activity would result in osmotic imbalance and cause the neurites to begin swelling. in addition to the loss of electronic properties and accompanying dysregulation of neuronal signaling, these changes might even feedback to influence gene expression. indeed, huang et al. demonstrated that cells exposed to ouabain have reduced na+/k+ atpase αiii subunit mrna expression  <cit> . an alternative pathway may involve interactions of aβ with surface proteins, such as integrins  <cit> . and focal adhesion proteins  <cit>  leading to activation of signal transduction cascades that mediate tyrosine phosphorylation  <cit> . bozulic et al. reported that the tyrosine kinase, lyn, can phosphorylate na+/k+ atpase resulting in its removal from the membrane  <cit> . these findings suggest that either direct inhibition of na+/k+ atpase by amyloid or its removal due to amyloid-mediated activation of a signaling cascade, could contribute to the formation of dystrophic neurites due to osmotic and/or ionic imbalances.

aβ has been shown to bind various cell surface proteins  <cit> . and induce neuro-toxicity in vitro  <cit> . to determine the effect of aβ 1– <dig> on na+/k+ atpase activity, we pre-incubated purified na+/k+ atpase with aβ then colorimetrically measured enzyme activity. although both preparations of aβ did suppress activity at  <dig> μg/ml  and  <dig> μg/ml , it was the highest concentration  of the soluble aβ suspension that precipitated the largest reduction in activity compared to vehicle, nearly rendering it completely inactive . the fibrillar aβ preparation did not exact the same precipitous decline in activity, demonstrating that it is not simply an artifact caused by high concentrations of a peptide that reduced activity. further investigations will be required to determine which physicochemical form of aβ is causing the reduced activity. this suggests that the aβ can directly bind to the na+/k+ atpase and decrease its activity. mark et al. suggests that the 25– <dig> amino acid region of the aβ peptide induces oxidative stress thereby impairing na+/k+ atpase activity  <cit> , and the findings presented herein are consistent with this earlier work.

CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that aβ deposition in transgenic mice is associated with reduced activity of na+/k+ atpase. in vitro studies suggest that high concentrations of aβ can quickly inactivate the enzyme activity. one area in the brain that might harbor aβ concentrations sufficient to suppress the activity of na+/k+ atpase would be the micro-domain near and immediately around the plaques. this is the area demonstrated to have reduced immunostaining for na+/k+ atpase, while exhibiting increased phosphorylated neurofilament staining consistent with dystrophic neurites. these results lead to the possibility that one factor contributing to the formation of dystrophic neurites is loss of ionic homeostasis. such changes might explain the "swollen" nature of these neuronal processes in the vicinity of plaques. it might also lead to sufficient disruption of electro-chemical properties as to disrupt normal information processing and lead to memory dysfunction. if these suggestions are correct, drugs targeted at activating na+/k+ atpase and maintaining ionic balance in these neurons may benefit alzheimer's patients by delaying the onset of neuritic dystrophia and memory dysfunction.
