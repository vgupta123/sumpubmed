BACKGROUND
green tea  is a popular beverage in east asia, and also used as a herbal remedy in europe and north america. green tea is considered to be antiinflammatory, antioxidative, antimutagenic, and anticarcinogenic  <cit> , and can prevent cardiac disorders. epidemiologically, it has been suggested that green tea consumption prevents type  <dig> diabetes. the amelioration of insulin resistance by green tea is associated with the increased expression level of glucose transporter iv in a fructose-fed rat  <cit> . green tea extract contains polyphenols , teanin and caffeine. the extract also includes pyrroloquinoline quinone, a newly discovered vitamin  <cit> . some constituent components have been shown to enhance the basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake of rat adipocytes  <cit> , to inhibit intestinal glucose uptake by inhibiting the sodium-dependent glucose transporter of rabbit intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> , and to reduce serum glucose level in alloxan-diabetic rats  <cit> . controversially, caffeine acutely lowers insulin sensitivity in humans  <cit> .

the present study was aimed at providing evidence of the improvement in glucose metabolism in humans and diabetic mice upon green tea consumption. furthermore, to investigate whether some serum proteins mediate the effects of green tea on hyperglycemia in the diabetic state, proteomic analyses were performed using seldi -tof -ms , because the seldi-tof-ms enables the measurement of the relative abundance of proteins of various sizes in a blood sample. here, we compared the proteomic patterns of sera from diabetic db+/db+ and wild-type mice, and further investigated the influence of green tea administration on the proteomic patterns of serum in diabetic mice. if the diabetic modifications of serum protein levels are reversed by green tea administration, these affected proteins can be used as therapeutic targets in diabetes.

RESULTS
oral glucose tolerance test 
we investigated whether oral glucose tolerance is improved in healthy volunteers by drinking a suspension of green tea powder. blood glucose levels were measured before and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min after drinking  <dig>  g of green tea. the effects of hot water without tea powder on blood glucose level in the same participants were also investigated. fig.  <dig> shows that glucose tolerance was substantially improved with tea administration compared with hot water administration. in detail, glucose metabolism increased in  <dig> participants, remained unchanged in  <dig> participants, and worsened in  <dig> participants. basal blood glucose levels  did not significantly change in all participants .

antihyperglycemic effects of green tea in diabetic mice
the crude extract of fresh tea leaves picked from either no. <dig> or no.  <dig> cultivar at  <dig> mg/kg significantly lowered bgl 2– <dig> h after peroral administration in streptozotocin -diabetic ddy mice in the fasting state . in the saline-treated control group , bgl slightly changed from  <dig> ±  <dig> mg/dl to  <dig> ±  <dig> mg/dl after  <dig> h, whereas in the green-tea -treated group , bgl markedly changed from  <dig> ±  <dig> mg/dl to  <dig> ±  <dig> mg/dl. similarly, bgl markedly changed from  <dig> ±  <dig> mg/dl to <dig> ±  <dig> mg/dl after  <dig> h in the green-tea -treated group .

the antihyperglycemic effects of green tea powder suspension at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mg/kg were examined  <dig> h after administration to the stz-diabetic mice in the fasting state. as shown in fig.  <dig>  green tea tended to lower bgl at  <dig> mg/kg, and significantly lowered bgl at  <dig> mg/kg. furthermore, the effect of green tea was compared among different groups of mice, i.e., stz-diabetic ddy mice, normal ddy mice, diabetic db+/db+ mice and +m/+m mice . bgls were significantly lowered in both stz-diabetic mice and db+/db+ mice  <dig> h after administration of green tea powder suspension , whereas no significant changes were observed in normal ddy mice and +m/+m mice.

no elevation of blood insulin levels was observed during the decrease in bgl either by tea leaf extract or by green tea suspension in stz-diabetic mice . these results suggest that both fresh green tea leaf extract and green tea suspension lower bgl without changing serum insulin concentration.

serum protein profiles altered in diabetic db+/db+ mice
to explore the mechanisms underlying the antihyperglycemic effect of green tea, proteomic patterns of sera from diabetic  and wild-type  mice were first investigated and compared to identify peaks specific to the diabetic state using seldi-tof-ms. samples of sera from fasting +m/+m mice were loaded onto cm <dig>  proteinchip arrays . the other types of proteinchip array, i.e., cm <dig> , q <dig>  and imac30-cu2+ , were also used to fractionate proteins in the serum. then, these arrays were analyzed using a proteinchip system, and the amount of individual serum proteins was estimated from the peak intensity of the mass spectral signal and the mass/charge ratio  equivalent to the molecular weight of each protein. all the spectral peaks of serum proteins from diabetic mice, which were significantly different  in intensities from those of serum proteins from wild-type mice, are shown in fig. 6a: the peak intensities of proteins at m/z  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were > <dig> times lower, and those at m/z  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were > <dig> times higher than respective peak intensities of proteins of sera from +m/+m mice. typical spectra are shown in figs. 6b and 6c .

modification of serum protein profiles of diabetic db+/db+ mice by green tea
serum protein profiles of db+/db+ mice were investigated  <dig> h after green tea administration, and compared with those administered with saline . again, we confirmed a significant decrease in bgl by green tea in the blood samples used in these proteomic analyses . all the protein signals that were significantly changed  in terms of peak intensity by the green tea administration, but not by the saline administration, are described in fig. 7a. the serum proteomic patterns of the green-tea-treated group demonstrate that the peak intensities of proteins at m/z  <dig> and  <dig> decreased to less than one third after  <dig> h of tea administration, whereas no significant changes were observed in the control group. typical spectra are shown in fig. 7b . when the results in fig. 7a are compared with those in fig. 6a to identify protein peaks specific for diabetes and which are sensitive to green tea administration, a peak at m/z  <dig>  was found . the intensity of this peak was significantly lowered in the diabetic state , and was significantly decreased  <dig> h after green tea administration .

the relative peak intensities of hemoglobin-related multisignals ranging from m/z  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit>  were increased by green tea administration . parallel changes were observed at half and double these m/z values  . since multicharged protein ions are apparently observed as proteins of different sizes in the mass spectrometry, these changes seem to reflect the modification of one group of proteins  by green tea intake.

discussion
green tea is widely consumed in asian countries, while black tea is most popular in western countries. the manufacturing process of green tea differs from that of black tea because freshly picked young leaves of the tea are immediately steamed. this process destroys the enzymes responsible for breaking down the color pigments in the leaves and allows the tea to maintain its green color during the subsequent rolling and drying processes. the amounts of constituent compounds are slightly different from those of black tea. pharmacological studies using constituent compounds in green tea have been recently reviewed by kaszkin et al.  <cit> . green tea extracts are more stable than pure epigallocatechin gallate, the major constituents of green tea, because of the presence of other antioxidant constituents in the extract  <cit> . in general, herbal medicines are complex mixtures of different compounds that often act in a synergistic fashion and exert their full beneficial effect as total extracts  <cit> .

in the present study, we demonstrated that green tea produces an antihyperglycemic effect without affecting insulin secretion in stz-diabetic mice. we therefore explore the mechanism underlying the green tea effect by investigating the serum protein profiles of db+/db+ mice, a genetic model of type  <dig> diabetes, using seldi-tof-ms. first, we performed a preliminary analysis to determine the peaks  of biomarker proteins that were abnormally contained in the serum of diabetic mice, without identifying individual serum proteins. as a result, we found that the levels of several serum proteins were significantly altered in the diabetic state. secondly, we investigated which marker proteins are affected by green tea administration. despite the changes in the levels of several serum proteins after green tea administration, none of the protein peaks specific for diabetes were sensitive to the administration, except for a peak at m/z  <dig>  the level of this  <dig> da protein was reduced both in the diabetic state and by green tea administration. thus, no simple reversed effect of green tea on the diabetes-induced modifications of serum protein levels was observed.

the  <dig> da protein has not yet been identified, but only two candidate groups of vertebrate proteins are found by scanning swiss-prot database : pancreatic polypeptide   and antibacterial peptides . pp is primarily expressed in the endocrine cells of the pancreas, and the plasma pp concentrations are elevated by food intake  <cit> . peripheral pp administration results in a reduction in food intake and an increase in energy expenditure  <cit> . interestingly, a previous study revealed that pp-containing cell populations in the islets of langerhans are reduced in db+/db+ mice with mild hyperinsulinemic diabetes  <cit> , which is consistent with the observed reduction in the intensity of the peak at m/z  <dig> in the diabetic state. we speculate that the reduction of bgl by green tea causes a decrease in serum pp concentrations as a means of maintaining energy homeostasis, although more precise studies are required.

the changes in serum protein profiles by green tea also demonstrate the increase in the peak intensities of hemoglobin-related multi-ms signals, suggesting the adverse side effects of green tea, although blood samples from db+/db+ mice tended to exhibit a hemolytic feature compared with those from wild-type mice . interestingly, the hemoglobin-related multi-ms signals shown in fig.  <dig> may include hemoglobin α-chains and β-chains  <cit> , their dimers, and possibly variously glycated hemoglobins. hemoglobin a1c is used as a marker of diabetes in clinical diagnostic tests. until now, however, the extent of glycation per hemoglobin that practically occurred is not clear. more detailed analyses of serum protein profiles using seldi-tof-ms will provide a more useful clinical index of the diabetic state.

we observed that green tea improved oral glucose tolerance in humans. it is therefore likely that green tea is prophylactic against diabetes and ameliorates diabetic hyperglycemia. green tea consumption at moderate doses may be associated with a reduced risk of type  <dig> diabetes in apparently healthy individuals by controlling postprandial hyperglycemia.

CONCLUSIONS
the control of postprandial hyperglycemia by green tea can help reduce the risk of type  <dig> diabetes. in the present study, we provide evidence showing that green tea promotes glucose metabolism in healthy humans, and produces an antihyperglycemic effect in diabetic mice. in addition, we analyzed the serum protein profiles of db+/db+ and +m/+m mice for the first time using seldi-tof-ms, and further investigated its association with any effects of oral green tea administration on serum proteins. among the several proteins that were significantly lowered in the serum of diabetic mice, the  <dig> da protein was significantly decreased after green tea administration. this is the first report demonstrating that a certain serum protein is involved in the antihyperglycemic effect of green tea. the contribution of this protein, therefore, should be further investigated in a future study.

moreover, we speculate that the observed effects of green tea on bgl are primarily due to the promotion of insulin action in peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscles and adipocytes. indeed, a recent paper showed that green tea supplementation for  <dig> weeks ameliorates insulin resistance and increases glucose transporter iv content in a fructose-fed rat model resembling the human type  <dig> diabetes mellitus  <cit> . since the administration of green tea produced an acute antihyperglycemic effect on bgl in diabetic mice in the present study, additional mechanisms, such as changes in amelioration or enhancement of insulin action, should be clarified in a future study. to elucidate whether new protein synthesis is required for green tea action, it would be useful to examine the influence of protein synthesis inhibitors on the acute antihyperglycemic effect of green tea.
