BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is the most commonly recognized cause of infectious nosocomial diarrhea  <cit> . illnesses associated with c. difficile range from mild diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon  <cit> . in the early 2000s, an emerging virulent strain, nap1/ <dig>  caused hospital outbreaks in canada  <cit> , and later, strains of the same genotype were also found in the united states of america, europe, and asia  <cit> . to understand the spread of bacteria and identify clones with apparent increased virulence, several molecular methods for genotyping have been used to investigate c. difficile  <cit> . multilocus sequence typing  is the "gold standard" for assessing population structure. polymerase chain reaction  ribotyping has been used for the global analysis of related virulent strains based on a reference library involving  <dig> genotypes acquired since  <dig>  and has become the most common technique to represent the epidemic clone of c. difficile  <cit> . in addition, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , surface layer protein a gene-sequence typing , restriction endonuclease analysis , and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis  have been used for outbreak studies of c. difficile  <cit> . among these techniques, mlva panels exhibit a significantly higher discriminatory power  than pfge, slpast, and pcr ribotyping  <cit> . as a result, mlva has been the most commonly used to distinguish strains from different outbreaks, whereas pcr ribotyping and pfge have mostly been used to detect long-term relationships among strains when compare to mlva  <cit> .

pcr ribotyping is performed using a pcr-based method to detect polymorphic sequences in the 16s-23s intergenic spacer region  in c. difficile  <cit> . the band-pattern data generated by this method is difficult to transport and to compare between laboratories  <cit> . therefore, a few studies have tried to replace pcr ribotyping with other methods  <cit> . typing of slpa, which is based on the s-layer gene sequence of c. difficile, recognizes only nine of the  <dig> pcr-ribotypes  <cit> . recently, a highly discriminatory mlst method based on seven housekeeping genes  sequences was develop to allow genotyping of c. difficile; the resulting sequence type  recognized  <dig> of  <dig> pcr-ribotypes  <cit> . to date, the tandem repeat sequences type  technique is the most concordant method; this method, which combines two variable tandem repeat sequences, resolved the phylogenic diversity at a level equivalent to pcr ribotyping  <cit> . the mlva employs multiple variable-number tandem-repeat  loci with varying levels of diversity to resolve genetic relationships. vntrs with a high degree of diversity are used to differentiate closely related strains. in addition, recent research in staphylococcus aureus and neisseria meningitidis showed that vntr loci with a lower degree of diversity can establish deeper phylogenetic relationships consistent with the mlst method, which is based on the slowly-mutating housekeeping gene sequences  <cit> . in the past, for c. difficile, the mlva panel has been found a more discriminatory method than pcr-ribotyping  <cit> . in this study, we hypothesize that an mlva panel with a lower combined allelic diversity may be more congruent to pcr ribotyping.

the purpose here was to determine a mlva panel that could yield results in accordance with pcr ribotyping results. serial mlva panels were compared with pcr-ribotype groups based on an investigation of  <dig> c. difficile isolates. by combining more conserved vntr loci, we found mlva <dig> had excellent congruence with the epidemic clone. moreover, a simple mlva  with high discriminatory power was also proposed as a useful alternative. therefore, mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> can be combined in four multiplex pcr reactions to save operation time when typing a large collection of isolates.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of vntr loci in c. difficile
a total of  <dig> vntr loci candidates were identified for c. difficile, and  <dig> were used for subsequent mlva analysis . initially, we found  <dig>  tandem-repeat loci within c. difficile  <dig> using the vntrdb software  <cit> . after exclusion of repeatedly detected loci, tandem-repeat loci with a copy number size > <dig> bp and an amplicon size of < <dig> bp were analyzed for variability. finally,  <dig> loci exhibiting variable alleles were identified. the allelic diversity, allele number, and typing ability of all  <dig> vntrs from the  <dig> strains were determined. several vntr loci with additional or imperfect repeats were observed . cdr <dig> amplicon exhibited two adjacent vntr loci, while cdr <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig> exhibited incomplete tandem repeats. to analyze these loci in the mlva panels, alleles of these loci were represented by repeat array size instead of copy number, and the mlva types were analyzed with minimum spanning tree  using a categorical coefficient. vntr loci with low typing ability and/or deletions were excluded, with the cdr <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig> loci amplifying at only 70%, 77%, 79%, and 79%, respectively. additionally, deletions in amplicons from cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig> were found. consequently, only  <dig> vntr loci were used in the following experiments.

capillary gel electrophoresis-based pcr ribotyping
of the  <dig> isolates, capillary gel electrophoresis-based pcr-ribotyping identified  <dig> independent types, including  <dig> singletons. the most common types were r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> , containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> isolates, respectively . the r <dig>  virulent type was not found among the local strains.

dendrogram based on pcr ribotyping
a phylogenetic dendrogram based on the pcr-ribotypes was constructed using the  <dig> c. difficile isolates . of the  <dig> isolates, pcr-ribotype, mlva <dig>  and mlva <dig>  identified  <dig> types,  <dig> groups, and  <dig> groups, respectively. the pcr-ribotype was more discriminatory than the two mlva groups . using a threshold of >83% similarity for defining pcr-ribotype groups, all isolates were able to be divided into  <dig> pcr-ribotype groups, including  <dig> singletons. over 87%  of the pcr-ribotype groups were specifically recognized in the mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> groups. however, pcr-ribotype groups  <dig> and  <dig> were recognized together as one by both mlva groups, with the fingerprints for these isolates sharing a 70% similarity . in addition, pcr ribotype groups  <dig> and  <dig> were also identified as one by the two mlva groups, with the fingerprints of these two isolates sharing a 78% similarity. furthermore, pcr ribotype groups  <dig> and  <dig> were also seen as one by the two mlva groups, with the fingerprint of these isolates sharing an 82% similarity. taken together, these results shows that this discordance, the lack of one to one identification between pcr ribotypes and mlva groups, mainly occurred when pcr-ribotypes shared >83% similarity.

congruence between groups of the pcr ribotype and mlva
mlva panels with slightly limit allelic diversity generated groups highly congruent with pcr ribotyping . to determine the most congruent groupings between mlva panels and pcr-ribotype groups, groupings of mlva panels consisting of vntr loci with high to low allelic diversity were compared with the pcr-ribotype groups. mlva <dig>  mlva <dig>  and mlva <dig> generated partitions  and allelic diversity  similar to those identified by pcr ribotyping . the congruence of the grouping of mlva <dig>  mlva <dig>  and mlva <dig> with the pcr ribotype groups amounted to  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively . these values were significantly higher than that of the mlva <dig> group . mlva <dig>  which included six highly variable vntr loci, c6cd, cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  and cdr <dig> , generated a lot more partitions  and higher allelic diversity  than pcr ribotyping. in most pcr-ribotypes, multiple alleles were observed for c6cd, cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  and cdr <dig> loci , whereas the other  <dig> vntr loci exhibited little variance. this data indicates that the greatest discrepancy between groupings in these two methods occurred in loci with high allelic diversity, and that congruence increased when the highly-allelic-diversity loci were removed, as in mlva <dig>

to identify a simplified panel resembling mlva <dig>  the groups from three smaller panels  were evaluated for agreement with the pcr-ribotype groups. mlva <dig> was the simplest panel yielding groups that were highly congruent  with the pcr-ribotype groups . in contrast, congruence significantly decreased when the mlva was simplified to just eight vntr loci.

minimum spanning tree analysis of pcr ribotyping-related mlva panels
mst analysis revealed that the mlva <dig> types could be clustered into  <dig> groups, including  <dig> singletons . most  of the mlva <dig> groups were specifically recognized as a single pcr-ribotype group, except for 34_ <dig>  34_ <dig>  34_ <dig>  34_ <dig>  34_ <dig>  and 34_ <dig>  an isolate of the group 34_ <dig> could not be typed by the cd <dig> and cd <dig> loci, and was separated from those of the 34_ <dig> mlva group; however, all isolates of the 34_ <dig> and 34_ <dig> groups belonged to pcr-ribotype group  <dig>  this shows that isolates of the 34_ <dig> and 34_ <dig> groups were closely related. isolates of group 34_ <dig> and 34_ <dig> were separated by their different allele numbers at cdr <dig> and h9cd loci, but these two mlva groups both belonged to the pcr-ribotype group  <dig> 

mst analysis revealed that the mlva <dig> types could be clustered into  <dig> groups, including  <dig> singletons , and most  of the mlva <dig> groups were specifically recognized as a single pcr-ribotype group. the clustering of mlva <dig>  yielded groupings similar to those of mlva <dig>  except for isolates of pcr-ribotype groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  since the cd <dig> vntr locus was not used in the mlva <dig> panel, isolates from the pcr-ribotype group  <dig> all belonged to the 10_ <dig> group. this indicates that the mlva <dig> panel was able to type more strains than the mlva <dig> panel. in addition, isolates of the pcr-ribotype groups  <dig> and  <dig> were grouped into the 10_ <dig> group, indicating that the mlva <dig> is less discriminatory than mlva <dig> 

discriminatory ability of mlva panels
mlva panels containing different numbers of vntr loci were used for discriminating  <dig> c. difficile isolates into different genotypes and the simpson's index of diversity  was shown to increase with the number of vntr loci used . using mlva <dig>   <dig> isolates were grouped into the largest partitions . mlva <dig> was shown to be as discriminatory as mlva <dig> using all  <dig> vntr loci . however, when the mlva panels contained fewer than three vntr loci, the partitions decreased significantly.

combined use of mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> for cluster detection
mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> were used for classifying  <dig> isolates acquired from a hospital in central taiwan, and four clusters were identified . these clusters consisted of three independent clusters  containing two isolates each from inpatients and one  cluster containing two isolates from outpatients during the ten month surveillance. each of the two isolates from the b, c, and d clusters were recovered from different pediatric patients with  <dig>   <dig>  and 4-days intervals of specimen submission by the physician from children's ward, respectively . the two isolates from cluster a were shown to differ at one locus  in the combined mlva <dig> plus mlva <dig> panel and were isolated from two specimens of the same patient within a four-day interval. most isolates were non-toxigenic strains, except those in cluster d. the patient in the d cluster developed diarrhea and was infected with toxigenic c. difficile strains that were assigned to c. difficile infection cases. on the other hand, a single pcr-ribotype group was usually grouped with less than five vntr loci differences .

discussion
a mlva system is composed of vntr loci that exhibit varying levels of diversity, and can be employed either for long-term or short-term investigations  <cit> . in the present study, we proposed two mlva panels, mlva <dig> and mlva <dig>  for the differentiation of c. difficile isolates. mlva <dig> exhibited a slightly lower allelic diversity than previously identified panels  <cit> , and is recommended as a complementary test to the pcr-ribotype groups. mlva <dig>  in contrast, exhibited high allelic diversity and is recommended for the detection of short-term evolution in strains of c. difficile.

in the current study, except for nine reference strains, the  <dig> local isolates were a widely distributed collection and none were previously reported as outbreak strains by clinical laboratories. these isolates were acquired from patients  <dig> - <dig> years of age and contained  <dig> isolates from outpatients that were assumed to be community-acquired strains. the other  <dig> isolates were recovered from hospitalized patients, with  <dig> collected from children's wards and  <dig> from adult wards. in addition, this study involved  <dig> pcr-ribotypes , a considerably higher number than previously reported  <cit> . therefore, the sample population used in the current study is proposed to be more suitable for comparison between the two methods  <cit> . in the ribotype distribution, it is noteworthy that the pcr-ribotype r <dig> , a clone found worldwide and is related to an animal source  was the fourth  most frequently identified type in this study   <cit> . in the current study, the r <dig> type was only found in samples obtained from central taiwan, but the exact distribution of pcr-ribotypes requires further investigation using a more precise sampling method. furthermore, pcr-ribotypes other than  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> should be compared with standard pcr-ribotypes from the european reference laboratory.

while comparing pcr ribotyping to other techniques, allelic diversity was identified as an important factor. previous studies identified that slpa type did not have high enough variability to differentiate all pcr-ribotypes  <cit> . the current study found that the cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  and c6cd vntr loci  <cit>  used in previous mlva panels were variable in each pcr-ribotypes ; this made these panels too discriminatory for congruency with the pcr-ribotypes here. in contrast, the highly discriminatory mlst method had an index of discrimination of  <dig> , similar to that of the pcr-ribotype , and the resulting st recognized 80% of the pcr-ribotypes  <cit> ; the trst resulted in an allelic diversity  equal to that of pcr ribotyping , and is the technique most related to pcr ribotyping among these studies  <cit> . in the present study, the ten vntr loci used in mlva <dig> were cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  h9cd, f3cd, and cdr <dig>  which exhibited a slightly lower allelic diversity  than the previously used cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  and c6cd vntr loci   <cit>  , resulting in a combined allelic diversity of  <dig>  . this value is similar to trst  and pcr-ribotype . therefore, both trst and mlva <dig> showed a high level of agreement with the pcr-ribotype  . however, the mlva technique is easier to perform than the sequence-based techniques, such as trst and mlst, and mlva panels are more easily combined, such as when adding the mlva <dig> panel for outbreak strain detection.

to represent the currently known pcr-ribotypes for c. difficile, a combination of multiple vntr loci with different allelic diversity is recommended. in our initial study, no single vntr locus was discriminatory enough to recognize all pcr-ribotypes or specific enough to belong to each pcr-ribotype , as previously observed for mlva and mlst of n. meningitidis  <cit> . therefore,  <dig> vntr loci distributed throughout the genome of the c. difficile  <dig> strain were used for comparison analyses, and we found that the mlva <dig> panel yielded groups most related to the pcr-ribotype groups . our screening method was based on two rationales: 1) the pcr-ribotype recognized the major pfge type  <cit>  and was expected to be congruent with the major genotypic groups of c. difficile; and 2) the locus markers distributed throughout the chromosome were more likely to identify genotypic change  <cit> .

in the current study we also highlighted the fact that group definition was required for comparisons. the allelic diversity of mlva <dig> types varied among the different pcr-ribotypes , and led to only 60% congruence between the types of mlva <dig> and pcr ribotyping . in significant contrast, the congruence reached 98% when groups obtained by the two techniques were compared . these observations were similar to those found in the comparison between mlva <dig> and pcr-ribotyping . even though there was a high level of agreement between groups identified by the two techniques, some discordance was found. for example, pcr-ribotype group  <dig> was represented by two mlva <dig> groups  , and the isolates in group  <dig> were suspected to have undergone concerted evolution  <cit> ; however, this assumption needs to be further confirmed by mlst.

for the detection of outbreak strains, two mlva panels, each composed of seven vntr loci, have been developed. one panel consisted of cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  and cdr <dig>  and the other panel consisted of c6cd, h9cd, f3cd, cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  and cdr <dig>  <cit> . however, our study indicated that mlva <dig>  which consisted of c6cd, cdr <dig>  cdr <dig>  and cdr <dig>  was able to discriminate all  <dig> test strains , as previously observed for mlva of salmonella typhimurium  <cit> . furthermore, all of these vntr loci exhibited higher allelic number and copy number variation than previously reported   <cit> . our results may be explained by two reasons: 1) among these loci, cdr <dig> loci was found exhibit incomplete copy number and was assigned by repeat array size, as this could increase the allelic number; and 2) we validated these loci in a more random population than previous studies  <cit> , which would increase the value of allelic diversity. in addition, we used a categorical coefficient instead of strd to analyze the mlva data and to analyze the loci represented by the repeat array size. although this may reduce the sensitivity to differentiate the outbreak strains, analyses using the strd coefficient were found to be too variable and may obscure the epidemiological links between c. difficile outbreak strains when several repeats at a locus are deleted or duplicated simultaneously  <cit> .

all clusters detected by mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> combined can be explained by epidemiological information. apart from the two patients from cluster d were c. difficile infection cases, other patients from other clusters were assumed to be c. difficile carriers . the major limitation of this validation for the study of outbreak strains was the sample population we used; the  <dig> test strains used in the current study were a randomly sampled population that did not contain outbreak strains, and the genetic relationship between these was distant. for these reasons, this may have overestimated the discriminatory power of the mlva  <dig>  therefore, the mlva <dig> panel requires further validation using closely related strains, such as outbreak strains from hospitals, before any conclusions as to its discriminatory power can be made.

five imperfect vntr loci  were used in this study, except for cdr <dig>  the other four loci were long-repeat vntr loci with incomplete repeats . the incomplete repeats may be caused by insertions and deletions, which often result in horizontal gene transfer between bacteria strains and obscured the phylogenic relationship in the bacteria population  <cit> . however, the long-repeat regions exhibited a higher frequency of recombinations, and were considered attractive candidate regions that could be used for determining phylogenetic relatedness between species and strains  <cit> . the long-repeat vntr loci have been known to be responsible for adaptive evolution, as for antigenic variation  <cit> , and were also used to differentiate the c. botulinum and n. meningitides <cit> . therefore, we analyzed these imperfect vntr loci for use in the screening for appropriate panels that showed agreement pcr-ribotyping. our data showed that cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig> loci did not decrease the congruency with pcr-ribotyping . the result may be due to that the 16s-23s intergenic spacer region, on which the pcr-ribotyping based on, was not as conserved as a housekeeping gene that is used to construct the phylogenic tree  <cit> . however, the variations from these incomplete repeat loci should be detected in our follow-up surveillance.

pcr ribotyping is a standard technique used worldwide for epidemic clone detection, but the ambiguous data generated by this technique is difficult for assessing inter-laboratory efficacy. mlva is a fast and easy-to-use method, and its numerical profile output is more transferable than the standard pcr ribotyping technique. in our laboratory setting, the cost of pcr ribotyping, mlva <dig>  and trst per isolate was $ <dig> , $ <dig> , and $ <dig> , respectively, and the cost of the most recent mlst is $ <dig>  according to griffiths' estimation  <cit> . in the current study, the cost of mlva <dig> was slightly higher than that of pcr ribotyping, but was still significantly less expensive than the trst and mlst sequence-based typing techniques. moreover, when analyzing a large number of isolates, it is simpler to perform one genotyping technique than multiple techniques. taken together, the mlva <dig> is recommended for the detection of c. difficile pcr-ribotype groups and for use in combination with the mlva panel designed for the detection of outbreak strains. future studies will involve evaluation of mlva <dig> for its phylogenetic information by comparison to mlst typing.

CONCLUSIONS
for the classification of c. difficile strains, the mlva technique can result in a distinguishable data set that is more useful for comparison and is highly congruent with pcr-ribotype results. the mlva <dig> panel may be used either to detect the pcr-ribotype groups or to overcome the drawbacks of the pcr ribotyping technique. in addition, the mlva <dig> can be used to detect closely-related strains. these two mlva panels can be combined and used for epidemiological studies of c. difficile.
