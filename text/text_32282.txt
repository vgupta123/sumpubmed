BACKGROUND
the gram-negative soil bacterium myxococcus xanthus is a model prokaryote for understanding the complexity of intercellular interactions that occur during multicellular development. when nutrients are limiting, groups of  m. xanthus cells can aggregate and assemble fruiting bodies. inside fruiting bodies, cells differentiate to form resting spores which are resistant to heat, ultraviolet light, and desiccation  <cit> . both the aggregation of cells during the morphogenesis of fruiting bodies and the differentiation of heat-resistant spores are dependent on subsets of genes involved in the ability of m. xanthus to glide over surfaces using two different mechanisms of locomotion, a-gliding and s-gliding.

gliding does not depend on flagella. a-gliding depends on the functions of more than  <dig> different genes, which encode products that enable individual cell movement by a mechanism that may involve secretion of a polyelectrolyte  <cit>  or motors that exist at focal adhesion sites  <cit> . s-gliding depends on the functions of more than  <dig> different genes, which encode proteins for the synthesis, regulation, and function of type ivpili   <cit> , lipopolysaccharide   <cit>  and exopolysaccharide   <cit> . strains with mutations in an a gene are motile because they retain s-motility, yet they form colonies that are smaller than the wild-type . conversely, strains with mutations in an s-motility gene are motile because they retain a-motility yet they also form colonies that are smaller than the wt. a-s- double mutants form colonies that lack flares at their edges, are unable to swarm  and are nonmotile  when viewed by time-lapse microscopy on  <dig> % agar.

mgla mutants produce colonies with smooth edges that are identical to colonies of the a-s- double mutants. they are described as nonmotile because they make no net movement, but when viewed by time lapse microscopy on the edge of a swarm, a few cells can be seen to reverse direction frequently  <cit> . the decreased efficiency of swarming outward from a central location may be due to a lack of coordination of the a and s-gliding motors by mgla.

the mgla gene encodes a  <dig> kd protein similar in sequence to members of the ras  superfamily of monomeric gtpases  <cit> . some of the defects caused by an mgla deletion mutation can be complemented by the expression of the yeast gtpase, sar1p, in place of mgla  <cit> . a sar1p mutant that is unable to hydrolyze gtp fails to complement the mgla mutant, suggesting that gtpase activity is critical for mgla function. like sar1p, mgla has consensus motifs for gtp binding and hydrolysis that are conserved among members of the small gtpases  <cit> . three of these regions contain residues that make contact with the mg2+ cofactor and ß and γ phosphates of gtp, and are called the pm  regions, and two of these regions are involved in specific contacts with the guanine ring, and are called the g regions  <cit> . an alternative convention labels the conserved motifs as g <dig> through g <dig>  <cit> .

the mgla sequence contains the pm <dig> region  19gxxxxgkt <dig>  which matches the consensus sequence, gxxxxgkt/s for small gtpases. a single conserved thr defines pm <dig>  for which several candidates exist in mgla between pm <dig> and pm <dig>  the consensus sequence of pm <dig> is dxxgq/t. here mgla differs from consensus because the corresponding region of mgla, 78txxgq <dig>  contains a threonine instead of an aspartate residue  <cit> . additionally, mgla contains identifiable motifs for guanine specificity. g <dig> is a conserved phenylalanine or tyrosine and g <dig> has the consensus n/tkxd. mgla has candidates for g <dig> in phe  <dig>  phe  <dig> or phe <dig>  g <dig> makes critical interactions with the nucleotide base with the asp side chain conferring specificity for guanine. the sequence 141nkrd <dig> of mgla matches the g <dig> consensus, n/tkxd. we have not identified a candidate region for the g <dig> consensus motif in part because the side-chains of g <dig> in ras assist in binding rather than interact directly with the nucleotide  <cit> . mgla lacks any identifiable motif for lipid modification such as palmitoylation or farnesylation seen with many eukaryotic ras-like proteins.

four recent studies confirmed in vitro gtpase activity of mgla from m. xanthus  <cit>  and the thermophilic bacterium thermus thermophilus  <cit> . experiments in our laboratory using refolded purified mgla determined a hydrolysis rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> for mgla using a direct assay  <cit> , similar to the intrinsic rate of ras, as well as other bacterial gtpases, such as era  <cit> . surprisingly, hydrolysis rates of  <dig> s- <dig> were observed for mgla using a coupled enzyme assay  <cit> , which is consistent with the rates given for ras stimulated by a gap protein   <cit> . although not specified by the authors, it is possible that a stimulating component may have co-purified and stimulated these remarkable rates of gtpase activity, which are > <dig> higher than any known bacterial gtpase. zhang et al. reported that they derived similar rates  <cit> . leonardy et al. reported hydrolysis rates of  <dig>  h- <dig> for purified mgla from thermus thermophilus. the lower hydrolysis rate for the thermus enzyme might be attributed to the fact that these assays were performed at 25°c, which is likely suboptimal for an enzyme from a hyperthermophile. addition of stoichiometric amounts of t. thermophilus mglb has been reported to stimulate hydrolysis, inferring that mglb might be responsible for stimulation of gtp hydrolysis by mgla  <cit> .

in this paper, we describe the phenotypes of a collection of mgla mutants that target consensus motifs or surface residues. previous random mutagenesis of mgla revealed that several residues were critical for proper expression of the mgla protein. mutants such as mgl <dig>  which changed a cys to a phe in what is predicted to be pm <dig>  failed to express detectable mgla whereas mgl <dig>  which altered a residue in the pm <dig> region, did not adversely affect mgla expression  <cit> . we engineered mutations that affect residues critical for gtp binding and found that they had a severe effect on gliding because, in many cases, these mutants failed to produce stable mgla protein, echoing the earlier observations of stephens et al. a subset of mutations affected swarming on  <dig> % agar to a greater extent than swarming on  <dig> % agar. two mutations  inhibited one or both motility systems in a dominant fashion. the results of this phenotypic analysis demonstrate that residues predicted to be essential for gtp binding and hydrolysis are critical for the functions of mgla in motility and development.

RESULTS
model of the structure of mgla and alignment
mgla is a  <dig>  da protein  <cit>  that shares identity  and similarity  with harvey ras  also called ha-ras or p21-ras,  which is a well-characterized member of the ras superfamily of monomeric gtpases found in eukaryotes. mgla shares 29% identity and 43% similarity with sar1p from saccharomyces cerevisiae, the gtpase that complements an mgla deletion  <cit> , and 30% identity, 49% similarity with adp-ribosylation factor-like protein  <dig> from dictyostelium discoideum ax <dig> 

a three-dimensional model for mgla was constructed to identify residues that may be involved in protein-protein interactions and to examine ways in which mgla might deviate from other gtpases. while attempts to grow crystals with purified homogeneous mgla have not been successful, the homology between mgla and gtpases with previously derived crystal structure templates enabled us to model mgla using the swiss-model program  <cit> . the in silico structure of mgla was used to generate a 3-d molecular model that could be manipulated in pymol  <cit> . the predicted structure of mgla based on the sar1p protein from s. cerevisiae , is shown in figure  <dig>  alignment of mgla with the template sequence sar1p allows for all conserved motifs to be correctly aligned with those in mgla, preserving the pm <dig> and pm <dig> regions.

as the crystal structure of the sar1p template lacks a portion of the n-terminus and begins with residue  <dig> of the predicted peptide, our mgla model also lacks a portion of the n-terminus and begins with asn <dig>  the sar1p template likewise lacks a c-terminal portion of the protein, and the best alignment was made possible by a truncation of mgla as well. hence, the mgla model ends with lys <dig>  which truncates ten residues of mgla. using pymol's alignment with least root mean square deviation  of this model with the crystal structure of sar1p containing gtp, we were able to determine the approximate position where gtp would bind to mgla. this is shown in figure 1a as a space-filling molecule.

the portion of mgla which contains the predicted surface residues d <dig> and t <dig> as circled in figure 1b was identified as one of our candidate sites for protein-protein interaction and is referred to as the recruitment interface. we additionally constructed an overlaid diagram with both the mgla model and the known ras crystal structure to identify if there were any locations that showed structural differences of import. ras is illustrated in yellow, while mgla is displayed in red in the cartoon representation of additional file 1: figures1mglarasoverlay. the mgla model contains a large loop of  <dig> amino acids that does not align with ras, a phenomenon observed in other gtpases  <cit> . we have termed this loop the m-loop as it appears to be distinct from those observed in other gtpases.

motility, swarming, and development capabilities of mgla mutants were analyzed
m. xanthus strain dk <dig> carries a deletion within the mglba operon and is unable to swarm  <cit> . all mgla modifications were constructed on a dna fragment that is necessary and sufficient to fully complement the motility and development defects of dk <dig>  when integrated at the mx <dig> attachment site or at the normal chromosomal site. for the studies presented here, all plasmids were electroporated into the Δmglba deletion strain dk <dig> and kanr clones arose from recombination between mgl promoter on the plasmid and the mgl promoter that exists on the chromosome in dk <dig>  all complementing strains examined in this study were found to grow vegetatively with a doubling time comparable to the dk <dig> , dk <dig> , and mxh <dig> .

the mutants were assayed for ability to swarm, a- and s-gliding characteristics at the colony edge, gliding rates and reversal frequency. swarm data for the wt and Δmglba strains are represented by the first two bars of figure 2b. wt displayed robust swarming on  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  agar. in contrast, swarming of the Δmglba strain was less than 2% of the wt. addition of plasmid pkd <dig>  to dk <dig> yielded mxh <dig>  which exhibited wt-like motility and development. swarming of mxh <dig> on  <dig> % and  <dig> % agar was  <dig> ± 9% and  <dig> ± 12% that of the wt, respectively. these data are presented in all swarm assay figures. for comparison, the phenotypes  of all complementing strains will be presented as a percentage of mxh <dig>  the reference control strain. the localization of mgla in cells gliding on agar and in methylcellulose is quite distinct  <cit>  and we considered that certain mgla mutations might yield a phenotype if the ability of an mgla to interact with protein partners was affected. hence, we assayed the localization of mgla in mutant strains using immunofluorescence as described in methods. localization patterns for each strain are shown in one common figure and are discussed in each section below.

mutations in the conserved pm <dig> consensus involved in gtp hydrolysis affect stability of mgla
the p-loop  is involved in hydrolysis of gtp in atpases and gtpases. mutations in pm <dig> were engineered to determine if residues known to be involved in gtp hydrolysis are needed for mgla activity. the corresponding region of mgla is previously shown in figure  <dig>  highlighted in yellow and begins with gly <dig> in a random coil region and ends with thr <dig> at the beginning of an α-helix. a linear diagram of mgla, shown in figure 2a, indicates the location of the pm <dig> region. three residues, gly <dig>  lys <dig> and thr <dig> that are conserved in the pm <dig> region of gtpases , were targeted for mutagenesis. residues gly <dig> and lys <dig> were substituted with alanine while thr <dig> was substituted with asparagine using overlap pcr  <cit>  to generate g19a, k25a and t26n. the t26n substitution was modeled after the dominant negative mutant of p <dig> ras, which abolishes the ability of ras-like proteins to properly coordinate magnesium and decreases affinity of ras for gtp  <cit> .

as shown in figure 2b, addition of mutant alleles to the deletion strain failed to restore swarming to wild type levels. swarming of g19a, k25a, and t26n was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % respectively on  <dig> % agar and  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % on  <dig> % agar respectively compared to the control.

swarming assays measure the ability of cells at high density to swarm over different surfaces but do not reveal information about specific motility behaviors. to examine the ability of individual cells to glide and reverse, time-lapse microscopy of cells at low density on  <dig> % ctpm agarose was used. no single-cell movement was visible for g19a, k25a or t26n on  <dig> % agarose identical to the behavior for the nonmotile Δmglba strain. in contrast, the control strain  moved at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/min and reversed once every  <dig>  min. although a frequency of one reversal every  <dig>  min has been previously published by blackhart and zusman for m. xanthus strain dzf <dig>  <cit> , we hypothesize that differences in strains , nutritional conditions, and preparation of samples may account for a difference in reversal frequency. our preparations included twice the amount of casitone in the agarose surface as previously published studies  <cit> .

software for tracking large numbers of cells works well at low cell density because cells are well isolated. this poses a problem to track cells using s-motility because close cell contact is necessary to stimulate retraction of pili. however, methylcellulose  has been shown to serve as a substitute for cell-cell contact  <cit> . therefore, to quantify s-motility of the mgl mutants, videomicroscopy of cells in  <dig> % mc and ctpm was used. under these conditions, wt cells reversed every  <dig>  min on average and moved with an average speed of  <dig>  μm/min . pm <dig> mutants moved at speeds less than 50% of the control in mc  and many of the cells exhibited an oscillating motion, a phenotype additionally observed in the Δmglba deletion parent in methylcellulose only . the phenotype of the t26n strain mxh <dig>  is representative of the pm <dig> mutants, where 96% of the cells oscillate in methylcellulose. for reference, additional file 5: movie  <dig> depicts a strain that has lost both a and s motility through defects in the respective motors in the form of a aglz- pila- double mutant, showing that this behavior is not the result of brownian motion.

time-lapse microscopy was performed to determine the rates of gliding cells.

a gliding and reversal rates for cells using a-motility were measured on  <dig> % ctpm agarose pads as described in methods. nm = cells were nonmotile. nr = no reversals observed.

b gliding and reversal rates for cells using s-motility were measured in  <dig> % methylcellulose plus  <dig> × ctpm as described in methods. nm = cells were nonmotile. gliding speeds are represented as the average and range of  <dig> cells from two independent assays.

csporulation rates are given as a percentage relative to the wt and the standard deviation if available. the ability of mgla mutants to complement the sporulation defects of the Δmglba mutant was performed as described in methods. mgl alleles were introduced into the wt background to determine mgla mutants could interfere with the function of normal mgla during sporulation.

all three strains were examined for their ability to move as individual cells or in groups at the edge of a colony arising from a single cell. the colony edge morphology is illustrated in figure 2c. a- and s-motility were restored  to the Δmglba mutant when complemented with wild type mglba, but addition of mglba constructs with mgla-g19a, k25a and t26n failed to complement.

to determine whether these mutants produced stable mgla, whole cell extracts were probed with α-mgla antibody. as shown in figure 2d, mgla protein was not detected by western blot analysis for any of the pm <dig> mutants relative to the loading control . wt cells displayed a punctate distribution of mgla along the cells length as visible by immunofluoresence, as shown in figure 3a. in contrast, the deletion parent mglba did not produce mgla and showed no fluorescence relative to the background, figure 3b. all pm <dig> mutations in conserved residues resembled the deletion parent as shown in figure 3b. to investigate the possibility that lack of mgla was due to decreased transcription, we performed rt-pcr to obtain a quantitative measure of transcription from the mgl locus. total mrna was obtained from mid-log phase m. xanthus and isolated as described in methods. the wt, Δmglba, two mutants that produce mgla without restoration of motility, and all mutants that failed to produce detectable amounts of mgla were assayed . the wt transcript level was normalized to one and all others are shown relative to the wt. in all cases that we examined, the inability to detect mgla on a western blot was not due to a defect in transcription. in fact, both mutants assayed that made mgla showed a slight decrease in transcript level, while several mutants that failed to accumulate protein showed an increase in mgla transcript relative to the wild-type. in particular, both changes at codon  <dig> increased the amount of mgl transcript 10-fold. upon in silico comparison of the predicted secondary structures of the mgl transcript from wt and q82r , we found that the single base substitution significantly alters the topology of the structure predicted to have the lowest free energy, as displayed in additional file 7: figures <dig> rna. hence, the q <dig> mutations may prevent transcript degradation, which could account for the elevated levels of mgl mrna detected in these mutants. it is conceivable that changes in the rna structure might also affect translation, thus contributing to the absence of accumulated protein in these mutants.

mutants with altered g <dig> motif fail to complement the deletion parent
the nkxd residues are located close to the guanine base of the gtp molecule presented in the model of mgla , suggesting an interaction with gtp similar to that described for ha-ras and other structural models  <cit> . the side chains of residues asn <dig>  lys <dig> and asp <dig> in ha-ras have been shown to exist within hydrogen-bonding distance of the base of gtp and are predicted to provide specificity for this purine over adenine  <cit> . mutations that affect asn <dig> and asp <dig> in ha-ras result in an increased nucleotide dissociation rate in vitro  <cit> .

alanine subsitutions were constructed for each of the conserved residues in the corresponding nkxd motif of mgla from residues  <dig> to  <dig> to determine if altering the predicted guanine binding pocket would affect gliding . plasmids carrying these mutations were introduced into the Δmglba mutant and their phenotypes characterized as described above. mutants n141a, k142a and d144a each produced colonies with smooth, even edges characteristic of a nonmotile colony . as shown in figure 5b, swarming of strains with n141a, k142a, and d144a alleles was <5% of the control on  <dig> % agar and <2% of the control on  <dig> % agar. no individual cell movement was seen by videomicroscopy on agarose and the oscillating movement of n141a, k142a, d144a mutants in mc was consistent with the behavior observed in the Δmglba deletion parent.

strains with mutations in g <dig> failed to produce sufficient mutant mgla to be detected by western blot as shown in figure 5d. this result suggested that g <dig> residues may be critical for the stability of mgla, or that failure to accumulate mgla may be a result of a decrease in transcriptional activation from the mgl locus. additionally, no mutant mgla was detected by immunofluorescence. all strains resembled the deletion parent, as shown previously in figure 3b. as with the pm <dig> mutants above, we examined the g <dig> mutants for their mgla transcript levels. as shown in figure  <dig>  we confirmed that a loss of transcription activation probably does not account for the lack of mgla protein since mgl mrna is found in comparable amounts to the wt. the inability to properly coordinate hydrogen bonds with the nucleotide may be responsible for our failure to detect mgla in the complementation strains as the protein may be unstable or misfolded without bound nucleotide.

mutations that correspond to activating mutations in certain monomeric gtpases affect the function of mgla
well-characterized activating mutations  in ras-like gtpases are predicted to reduce the rate of gtp hydrolysis in vivo  <cit>  and are gap insensitive  <cit> . residues in mgla that correspond to known activating  mutations at amino acids g <dig>  g <dig>  a <dig> and q <dig> of ha-ras were engineered to make g21v, l22v, p80a, and q82a  changes, respectively, in mgla.

motile flares at the colony edges of mglag21v and l22v strains showed that motility was restored partially . both mutants could swarm on  <dig> % agar: swarms were 32% and 89% the level of the control for g21v and l22v, respectively as shown in figure 6b. both strains swarmed poorly on  <dig> % agar, 3% and 37% that of the control for g21v and l22v, respectively, which suggests that both mutations exert stronger effects on s-motility than on a-motility.

cells containing mglag21v could neither move individually on a  <dig> % agarose surface nor in  <dig> % mc , although stable mgla was produced and some flares were observed at the colony edge . in contrast, videomicroscopy showed that the l22v mutant glided well on agarose  and showed speeds in methylcellulose of 71% of the control . reversals occurred less frequently in the l22v mutant  in both agarose and in mc . although these results would seem to contradict the swarming assay, we observed a density-dependent effect on motility in the microscopic assays. when cells were in contact, both g21v and l22v speeds increased and more closely correlated with their success in swarming assays.

the proline in pm <dig>  p <dig>  is conserved in proteins closely related to mgla as well as distant relatives lepa, obg, era and yiha. many eukaryotic gtpases, such as those in the rho, ras and rab families, contain an alanine in this position. the analogous residue a <dig> in ha-ras is involved in retaining gdp by preventing dissociation of the ligand by conformational change in ha-ras and mutation to threonine is considered an activating mutation  <cit> . to explore the possibility that substitution of the bulky proline in mgla might improve its function, p <dig> was changed to alanine. although the p80a mutant improves the pm <dig> motif match with most eukaryotic, as well as many prokaryotic gtpases such as ftsy, ychf, and trme, this mutation completely abolished mgla function in vivo despite the fact that stable mgla protein was made . the p80a mutant was mot- and dev-.

mglaq <dig> mutants were expected to reduce the rate of gtp hydrolysis based on the effect of the analogous change in ras . initially q82r was made to mimic known ras mutants but this mutant allele failed to produce detectable mgla  and the strain was nonmotile. subsequently, q82a was made to offset concerns that the charged arginine in this position inhibited folding of mgla. unfortunately, the q82a mutant likewise did not produce mgla and the phenotype was indistinguishable from the parent. zhang et al. reported stable mglaq82l expressed from the att site, however our constructed mutants  failed to accumulate stable mgla protein  <cit> . time-lapse microscopy failed to detect any movement on  <dig> % agarose for either strain; motility in mc was nearly identical with the parent. loss of transcript did not appear to account for the problem because, as shown in figure  <dig>  the levels of mgla transcript for both the q82a and q82r were found to be elevated. the apparent increase in mrna level by qrt-pcr and, paradoxically, the decreased expression of mgla may be due to alterations in the predicted secondary structure of mgl rna resulting from codon  <dig> modifications.

all activating mutation strains were assayed for their localization. we did not detect mgla in the q <dig> mutants, consistent with the western blot showed in figure 6d. in the g21v and l22v, we observed localization as previously seen in figure 3d, which depicts the l22v localization pattern. the localization pattern for p80a was indistinguishable from the wt .

mutations that are predicted to affect surface residues alter or decrease mgla function and may affect protein-protein interactions
based on the three-dimensional model of mgla , we predicted that residues asp <dig>  thr <dig>  leu <dig>  leu <dig> and leu <dig> might be surface exposed. asp <dig> and thr <dig> lie within a region that corresponds with a gap  effector-binding region of eukaryotic gtpases  <cit> . leu <dig>  leu <dig> and leu <dig> are three of the leucines that comprise a short stretch between leu <dig> and leu <dig> that resembles a leucine repeat   <cit>  that are likely to reside on a single face of an α-helix. these hydrophobic residues and their neighbors would either be buried in the interior of the protein or would indicate a potential binding site for an interacting protein with a similar hydrophobic face. the residues in this leucine-rich repeat  were indicated in orange in figure  <dig> and are highlighted in figure 7a. the role of each of these residues in gliding and development was investigated.

residues d <dig> and t <dig> were found to be critical for the function of mgla. both mutants produced stable mgla protein that had significantly reduced function. although some gliding flares  were apparent at the colony edge of each mutant strain , swarming was abolished . both strains displayed oscillating motions in methylcellulose, showing a far increased frequency of reversals indicative of the parental phenotype , and it showed motility in microscopic assays similar to the parent strain. because of this frequency, we believe that progressive movement from the central spot is less efficient, i.e., net movement as measured by the swarming assay is decreased. because both d52a and t54a mutants behaved like the deletion parent, yet make mgla protein, we investigated whether the localization pattern was different in these mutants. indeed, both d52a and t54a produced a diffuse staining pattern with anti-mgla, which suggests that these mutations, which lie on a predicted recruitment interface of mgla, profoundly affect the ability of mgla to interact with a partner. a representative t54a if is shown in figure 3c. the diffuse pattern was seen for only one other mutant, mglad52a. in contrast, other mutants that make mgla, such as l22v, exhibited a pattern of localization that was similar to the wt .

candidate surface-exposed leucine residues of mgla were changed in an attempt to identify potential protein binding sites. while single mutations at l <dig> or l <dig> had a mild effect on the function of mgla , the l117a/120a double mutant strain failed to produce detectable mgla protein, despite the fact that transcript was made . consistent with all other mutants that fail to make mgla protein, the l117a/l120a mutant was nonmotile . by contrast, colonies of the l124k mutant, which made mgla protein, had wt-like flares and mutant cells swarmed on  <dig> % agar  and  <dig> % agar . in microscopic assays, the l124k mutant demonstrated robust gliding on  <dig> % agarose , exceeding the control by 2-fold. movement in mc was 94% of the control. the reversal frequency was elevated in this mutant - cells reversed every  <dig>  min on agarose, about half that of the control  and every  <dig>  min in mc compared to  <dig> in  <dig>  min for the control. this might account for the decrease in swarming, particularly on  <dig> % agar.

amino acid residue thr <dig> is conserved among a group of mgla-like proteins and is essential for motility
the pm <dig> region of all ras superfamily gtpases characterized to date have the consensus sequence dxxg. in contrast, the corresponding region of mgla has the sequence txxg. this distinguishing feature is not an anomaly since homologs of mgla found in other bacteria all contain the txxg sequence   <cit>  and may define a new subfamily of small gtpases.

a mglb partner is denoted as an open reading frame immediately upstream from mgla with an identifiable roadblock/lc <dig> motif. bvalues for identity and positives  are relative to the  <dig> amino acid protein mgla from myxococcus xanthus. blast analysis was performed as described  <cit> . identity and positives show the number of identical  residues as a fraction of the total number of residues used for alignment. this fraction is given beneath as a percentage.

the mgla-like proteins fall into two groups based on their sizes. group  <dig> proteins range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, similar to ras . group  <dig> proteins range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. homologs in this group have additional c-terminal domain of unknown function. a comparison of identity and similarity between m. xanthus mgla and its group  <dig> and  <dig> homologs, including those from geobacter sulfurreducens, bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, thermus thermophilus, and chloroflexus aurantiacus, is shown in table  <dig>  an alignment between m. xanthus mgla and its group  <dig> homologs, including those from g. metallireducens, b. bacteriovorus, t. thermophilus, and deinococcus radiodurans, is shown in figure  <dig> 

as the substitution of a polar threonine residue for an acidic aspartate residue in the pm <dig> region  is unusual among the small gtpases in the ras superfamily, we investigated the role of this residue in the function of mgla. surprisingly, the mglat78d modification, which perfects the overall consensus with all other gtpases , abolished the activity of mgla, even though mgla protein was produced  and yielded a localization pattern similar to the wt . the t78d mutant had an even, smooth border  and was unable to swarm . additionally, motility on  <dig> % agarose and in mc was completely abolished .

other substitutions at thr <dig> had less severe effects. the motility defect of a Δmglba strain was complemented only poorly by the mglat78a allele, which also makes mgla protein . although small flares, suggestive of s-motility, were present at the edges of colonies formed by strain mxh <dig> , the swarming rates were very low . isolated cells characteristic of a-motility were not seen at the edges of mxh <dig> colonies although some movement was observed by videomicroscopy on  <dig> % agarose . gliding in mc  was only marginally better than the Δmgl parent.

a conservative threonine to serine substitution yielded stable, functional mgla. as shown in figure 8c, the edge morphology of mxh <dig>  was indistinguishable from the wt. swarming of the t78s mutant was 100% of the control strain on a  <dig> % agar but only 26% of the control on  <dig> % agar suggesting that s-motility is impaired specifically in this mutant . consistent with this, videomicroscopy showed that the t78s mutant restored gliding speeds to 66% of the control on agarose  but gliding rates on mc were only 56% of the control.

some mgla mutants impart a dominant negative phenotype
mutations in mgla that alter residues critical for protein interaction might have a dominant effect on motility and can be useful tools to identify protein partners and suppressors. to identify such residues and determine the phenotype of mutant forms of mgla in the presence of wt mgla, we constructed merodiploid strains. mutant alleles of mgla with normal mglb and the mgl regulatory region were integrated at the chromosomal site of dk <dig> , resulting in two tandem copies of mglb and mgla each expressed from the mgl promoter. two additional controls were included in these assays to examine the effect of multiple copies of mglb and mgla on motility. one strain  contained two wt copies of mglba and one strain  contained an additional copy of mglb, to simulate the effects of a merodiploid that carries an allele of mgla that fails to produce stable mgla protein, but produces extra mglb.

as shown in figure  <dig>  deletion of mglba abolishes swarming that is restored to near wt levels upon addition of mglba. the presence of an extra copy of mglba or mglb introduced to the wild-type parent  decreased swarming by 13% and 40%, respectively, on  <dig> % agar and by 47% and 50% respectively on  <dig> % agar relative to wt. while the gliding speed on  <dig> % agarose was not severely affected by the addition of a second copy of the full mgl locus , cells reversed twice as often in the full mgl merodiploid on  <dig> % agarose , compared to the wt . in contrast, addition of a second copy of mglba caused the rate of gliding in  <dig> % mc to double , yet the reversal frequency in mc was unchanged. similarly, the addition of a second copy of mglb only had minimal impact on gliding on agarose  and modestly improved gliding speed in mc . reversal frequencies were unchanged. the mechanism by which additional mglb and mgla affect motility is still being explored but if mglb from m. xanthus has gap activity as reported for the related mglb from thermus and mglb from m. xanthus  <cit> , extra copies of mglb might deplete the amount  of active  mgla in the cell. our results suggest that this affects swarming without significantly affecting the motor rates.

for the purposes of this investigation, the merodiploid strains containing mutant alleles of mgla are compared to mxh <dig>  the merodiploid containing two full copies of the mgl locus, referred to hereafter as the merodiploid control. the first two bars displayed in figure  <dig> show swarm data for the wt and deletion parent, followed by the complement control, the wt merodiploid mxh <dig> and the mglb merodiploid mxh <dig> respectively. merodiploid controls are shown in yellow. the remaining colors are grouped according to recognized monomeric gtpase motifs. among the merodiploids carrying mutant alleles, five phenotypes were observed based on colony swarming and motility rates: little or no change relative to the control, improved swarming, reduced a-motility , reduced s-motility  and reduced a and s-motility. in the analysis, we took into account that changes in swarming might be attributed to additional mglb for the nine constructs for which the mutated allele of mgla fails to produce stable protein. these nine strains produced normal mglb and mgla, plus additional mglb. the remaining strains produced additional mglb and mutant mgla.

the swarming capability on  <dig> % agar for strains that made mutant mgla protein was compared with the wt carrying extra wild-type mglba . mglad52a and mglat78d were dominant to mgla, inhibiting a-motility by >80%. with regard to d52a, the result hints that the putative recruitment interface, where d52a maps, is important for mgla interactions with an a-motility protein, such as aglz. the fact that mglad52a interferes with normal mgla function, perhaps through sequestration by a putative partner, also explains why mglad52a in single copy abolishes both a and s motility. the behavior of the t78d mutant, whether it is with or without wt mgla, suggests that it also might interfere with mgla's partners.

one mutant, mglal22v, had a stimulatory effect. for other mgla-producing strains, swarming was comparable to the control. as described above, swarming on  <dig> % agar was reduced in strains with a second copy of mglb . with this in mind, we compared swarming of strains that harbor unstable forms of mgla. the phenotypes of five mutants were more severe than the control. strains carrying q82a/r and n141a inhibited swarming slightly while mglag19a and t26n stimulated swarming. these differences might result from modest changes in transcription of mglba or to transient production of mutant mgla.

surprisingly, swarming on  <dig> % agar was inhibited in a majority of the merodiploid constructs, which suggests that anything that perturbs mgla has a more profound impact on s-motility. this effect is not due to the extra copy of mglb because there was no significant difference between mxh <dig>  and mxh <dig>  . mglat78d, which was dominant to mgla for a-motility , was also dominant with regard to swarming on  <dig> % agar, although cells showed near normal activity or an increase in velocity in mc by the microscopic motility assay . although there was no strict correlation between genetic dominance and the production of stable mutant mgla or transcript, we noticed that mutations that had a pronounced effect on gliding were clustered in the second half of the protein. in these mutants, a sufficient amount of the n-terminus of mgla might be made and folded to produce the inhibitory effect seen in these mutants. if this simple interpretation is correct, it would suggest that the n-terminal region of mgla regulates s-motility directly or indirectly.

alteration in mgla function produces aberrant fruiting body morphology
previous studies have shown that mgla is required for proper fruiting body formation and sporogenesis when cells are starved for nutrients  <cit> . each of the mutant strains was assayed for their ability to aggregate and form fruiting bodies on starvation medium. after  <dig> days, developing samples were heated and the number of heat-resistant spores was quantified. as shown in figure  <dig>  fruiting bodies containing refractile spores were present in the wt strain  but not in the Δmglba mutant . the deletion strain had less than  <dig> % of the wt number of spores whereas the complementing control produced the wt number of spores. representative microphotographs of developing samples are show in figure  <dig>  sporulation efficiency is presented in table  <dig> 

mutants that failed to produce detectable mgla  were unable to develop fruits or spores and resembled the Δmglba parent . a representative of this group is shown in figure 11f . of the mutants that made mgla protein , two mutants, l124k  and l22v , produced dark fruit that resembled the control, but were slightly smaller in size. all other mgla-producing strains produced only weak mounds  or failed to produce mounds at all . the developmental defect associated with t78a was in sharp contrast with the t78s phenotype, which produced mature dark fruit identical to the control . sporulation was affected in all of the mgla mutants . one possible explanation for why most mgla mutants failed to produce spores may be due to the fact that there was a decreased frequency of phase variation observed in certain mgla mutants. these remained phase-stable in a yellow variant, while strains that did form spores seemed capable of more regular variation between tan and yellow variants . additionally, the stability of wild-type mgla was examined during a period of  <dig> hours after the onset of starvation. there is a marked decrease in the amount of mgla detectable by western blot by sixteen hours as shown in additional file 8: figures8development. previous experiments have shown a depletion of gtp during starvation related to the formation of a messenger ppgpp in m. xanthus that may explain this observed degradation of mgla. if gtp is important for the stability of mgla, it is likely that any depletion or sequestration would also lead to a degradation of the protein.

a subset of mgla mutants interfered with the function of normal mgla to form fruiting bodies and heat-resistant spores. the presence of three mgla mutants, l124k, g21v and t78a  resulted in fruiting bodies that were smaller than the control while two mutants, n141a and t78d  abolished the ability of normal mgla to produce fruit. the ability to form fruiting bodies did not necessarily correlate with ability to form spores in the merodiploid strains. half of the merodiploids showed near-normal spore efficiency  and a few mutants produced a reduced complement of heat-resistant spores  . germination of heat-treated spores was reduced over 3-fold in six merodiploids containing the mutations t26n, d52a, t54a, t78d, q82a, and l124k. we find this result puzzling because four of these mutants make stable mutant mgla protein but the remaining two do not make mgla on vegetative plate medium. moreover, fruiting body formation was adversely affected in only two of the mutants in this group. work is underway to determine how these residues affect the function of role mgla during sporogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
mgla is a small gtpase that is required for gliding motility and starvation-induced fruiting body development, but not growth, of m. xanthus. previous work showed that nearly all known mgla mutants failed to make detectable protein  <cit>  which has complicated the genetic structure-function analysis of mgla. to determine if forms of mgla could be identified that specifically affected a-motility, s-motility, or both, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate a new collection of mutants.

mutants fell into three general classes based on the ability of plasmids bearing pmgl, mglb and mutant mgla alleles to complement the defects of the Δmglba mutant. class i mutants  made mgla protein and were able to swarm on surfaces and develop to some extent. class ii mutants  made mgla protein but did not swarm on surfaces or develop. class iii mutants  failed to produce mgla protein and were unable to glide on surfaces, swarm, or develop fruiting bodies. for clarification, a flowchart is provided as figure  <dig> 

mutations at one position, thr <dig>  yielded mutants in classes i and ii. thr <dig> is conserved in the mgla homologs found in bacteria, but it represents a significant departure from the consensus found in all other prokaryotic and eukaryotic gtpases, which use an aspartate in this position. mgla could tolerate serine in this position, but alanine and asparate abolished activity. thr <dig> may represent a target for modification in mgla or may be essential for the interaction between mgla and critical effector proteins. mutations in ras that correspond with this region of the mgla protein are known to render ras insensitive to gap proteins  <cit> , thereby affecting the rate of gtp hydrolysis in vivo by interaction with a critical surface feature of ras-gap known as the "arginine finger"  <cit> . thus, the change of thr <dig> to asp may affect the ability of mgla to interact with other proteins in vivo. consistent with this idea, we found that t78d was dominant to wt mgla for motility and development. these results show that threonine is critical for activity and suggest that mgla and its homologs represent a novel subfamily of gtpases.

activating mutations are predicted to shift the balance to favor more of the gtp-bound  state of the gtpase. while it is not possible to make a global generalization, since some of the activating mutants failed to make protein, mutants with g21v and l22v made protein and were partially motile. the phenotype of the l22v mutant was less severe than that of the g21v mutant, a result that is consistent with the phenotypes reported for eukaryotic gtpases  <cit> .

g21v was a mutation based on g12v of ras, which decreases the rate of hydrolysis, a fact confirmed in a bacterial mgla from thermus thermophilus. kcat for a g21v mutant was  <dig> times lower than that of wt mgla  <cit> . they also reported individual movement on buffered  <dig> % agar slabs. in contrast, we saw predominantly social motility in our microscopic assays, with few individually moving cells . as previously discussed, the differences in nutritional conditions as well as agar content may dictate which motility system is active. however, leonardy et al. did not investigate the effect on motility under conditions where social motility was favored.

additionally, leonardy et al. constructed a t26/27n double mutant while we constructed a single t26n mutation. their mutant showed increased stability relative to our t26n mutant but was completely non-motile under all conditions they assayed. their thermus mgla carrying this mutation showed a further decrease in hydrolysis relative to both wt and g21v activating mutation, but also showed a substantial decrease in affinity for mantgtp and the non-hydrolyzable analog mantgppnhp  <cit> .

a subset of mutations predicted to disrupt surface residues yielded strains with potentially informative phenotypes. the substitution at leu <dig>  which may be part of a lrr, might alter the interactions with an effector protein. one candidate is aglz, a protein known to interact with mgla  <cit> , which contains heptad repeats that are characteristic of lrr-domain protein partners. potential cycling of the mgla, aglz, and frzs triumvirate may yield clues to the regulation of a- and s-motility. mauriello et al. confirmed the interaction of aglz and mgla, as well as frzs and mgla using tandem affinity purification  <cit> . if the l124k substitution altered the affinity of mgla for aglz, this might perturb the interaction between aglz and frzs and might explain why the l124k mutant showed increased frequencies of cell reversal, however further investigation will be necessary to characterize the nature of this perturbation.

two mutations in mgla altered the ability to localize correctly as observed by immunofluorescence. both of the mutations which appeared to disrupt correct localization were predicted to be located on the surface of the protein, and on one face. one critical residue, d <dig>  is analogous to the d <dig> residue in ras, which has been shown to interact with a lysine in the protein nore1a. nore1a is a cytoskeletal protein that has been shown to be a suppressor of growth and oncogenic properties of active ras  <cit> . it is possible that mutation of d <dig> in mgla has disrupted a similar protein interaction which would account for its lack of proper localization and function in a complementation background, and also the mutation's effects on the ability of m. xanthus to control reversal. we posit that the surface containing both d <dig> and t <dig> is responsible for proper recruitment of mgla to the cytoskeleton and that proper localization along the cytoskeleton is required for control of a-motility as well as regulating cell reversal.

the failure of class iii mutants to make detectable mgla was surprising as similar sets of mutations in other monomeric gtpases have not been reported to affect protein stability. introduction of polar residues in critical residues of ha-ras  created a protein that was unable to bind gtp correctly, but did not alter stability  <cit> . replacement with other large nonpolar or charged groups also altered gtp binding, but mutant proteins were stable in vitro  <cit> . this suggests that gtp binding itself has the potential to regulate the function of mgla in motility and development. depletion of gtp by rela as the cells respond to the starvation cue  <cit>  might serve to shift motility patterns by reducing the amount of available mgla during development. the apparent disappearance of mgla during development would tend to suggest that a lack of gtp and the subsequent proteolysis of mgla may provide an internal timeline for proper development. mutations that affect the ability of mgla to bind gtp may disrupt this process by allowing the premature degradation of mgla before spore maturation can occur. this observation represents a fundamental difference between mgla and other gtpases that may provide clues to the evolution of this group of protein.

zhang et al. recently reported the phenotype of an mglaq82l mutant, though no gtp hydrolysis rates were given  <cit> . this was another predicted activating mutation, similar to that of q61l of ras. it is possible that their mutant was stabilized by replacement with a leucine, similar to that seen in other mutants where the character of a mutation may stabilize the protein while affecting binding affinity. our mutants at this location were actively transcribed, but appeared to be unstable, as no mglaq82a/r was detectable by western blot in three separate assays.

with regard to the merodiploid strains, which were constructed to look for dominance, we noted that perturbations in the balance of products from the mgl operon had a noticeable effect on motility. the presence of an extra copy of mglb inhibited the ability of merodiploid strains to swarm on  <dig> % agar regardless of whether an extra copy of mgla was present. therefore, balance of products from the mgl operon and other motility components may be critical for proper regulation of social motility in m. xanthus. the dominance screen yielded new tools for future studies. a predicted surface residue, d <dig>  has potential for identifying protein partners for mgla because it was essential for gliding in the haploid and mgla-d52a abolished a-motility in the merodiploid. similarly, the critical threonine at position  <dig> affected both a and s motility when mgla-t78d was paired with normal mgla.

while it is possible that overall dominant effects on s-motility are due to sequestration of gliding motor or regulatory components, research in other organisms has shown that the formation of a gtpase homodimer may be important for function. dimerization has been observed to increase hydrolysis roughly twofold in attoc <dig>  a gtpase involved in protein import into chloroplasts  <cit> . crystal structures show that era and xab1/mbd can each form dimers  <cit> . although no crystal structure exists for mgla yet, it is possible that the dominant effects observed in our merodiploid mutant strains may be due to a decrease in the ability of mgla to function as a dimer in the regulation of motility and development.

homologs of mgla found among the genomes of a diverse group of prokaryotes will likely provide clues to the evolution of this group of proteins. based on the high degree of conservation among predicted mgla homologs, it is possible that these proteins share a common function. it is intriguing that all of the organisms identified to date that have homologs of mgla also carry structural genes for the assembly of tfp. anaeromyxobacter dehalogens  <cit> , geobacter metallireducens  <cit> , and members of the related genera deinococcus and thermus, have genes encoding tfp  <cit> . similarly, some genes for tfp determinants are found in the genome of the filamentous glider chloroflexus aurantiacus, an anoxygenic, thermophilic photosynthetic bacterium  <cit> . not all organisms that have tfp have an mgla homolog, nor is it clear that all organisms encoding tfp use these components for motility. for example, thermus thermophilus uses tfp machinery for dna transfer  <cit> . future studies might reveal a novel pathway by which these unusual gtpases regulate tfp components in organisms from diverse habitats and in diverse functions.
