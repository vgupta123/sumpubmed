BACKGROUND
genechip® exon  <dig>  st is a new microarray platform developed and marketed by affymetrix  <cit> . this microarray platform changes the conventional view of transcript analysis since it allows the evaluation of the expression level of a transcript by querying each exon component. this enables the study of specific alterations in splicing patterns such as those found in association with cancers  <cit> .

the genechip® exon  <dig>  st microarray platform is based on methods quite different from the 3' ivt arrays expression detection. whilst the conventional affymetrix genechips feature a probe set consisting of 11– <dig> probes selected from the 3' end of the mrna sequence, the new all-exon arrays have  <dig> probes selected from each putative exonic region. to generate the target, exon  <dig>  st arrays use t <dig> linked random hexamers for cdna synthesis, instead of those of all previous affymetrix expression arrays, which employed an oligo-dt linked t <dig> and thus required an intact poly-a tail. importantly, this new wt sense target labeling assay generates dna targets and therefore results in dna/dna duplex formation during hybridization, as opposed to dna/rna hetero-duplexes in conventional arrays. it has been shown that there is close agreement between the conventional affymetrix 3'ivt arrays and the new exon  <dig>  st arrays  <cit> . furthermore, exon  <dig>  st sensitivity of gene expression detection was shown to be in the same range of 3'ivt arrays  <cit> . though at gene-level 3'ivt and exon  <dig>  st show similar behavior, exon  <dig>  st technology raises some issues about the computational instruments to be used for the analysis of exon-level data. affymetrix proposed an analysis workflow based on pre-filtering of the expression data , transformation of exon-level intensity data in gene-level normalized values called splice index  and statistical validation based on an anova based method based on measuring differences between an exon-level signal and aggregated gene level signal called midas .

there has however been no way to date of defining the efficacy of this workflow or of different statistical methods in the detection of alternative splicing events. the ideal instruments to evaluate the effect of data pre-processing and the efficacy of different statistical methods on differential expressions are benchmark spike-in experiments  <cit> , where a limited number of transcripts are spiked-in at various concentrations in a common mrna background. in spike-in based experiments it is therefore possible to investigate differential expression sensitivity as a function of the false discovery rate . in this study a semi-synthetic exon-skipping experiment, encompassing  <dig> exon skipping events, was generated starting from the latin-square spike-in experiment of abdueva  <cit> . the semi-synthetic exon-skipping data set was used to evaluate the effects of data pre-processing as well as the performance of two statistical methods, midas and rank product   <cit> , on ases detection.

RESULTS
a benchmark experiment to validate ases detection methods
exon skipping events were generated using the experimental data, kindly provided by abdueva  <cit> . the abdueva data set is a latin-square experiment encompassing  <dig> genes, selected as ideal spike-in genes due to their expression absence in hela cells, which represents the mrna background of the experiment. the spike-in concentrations were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> pm and the  <dig> genes were grouped in  <dig> subsets. each experimental point was technically replicated three times for a total of  <dig> arrays.

to build the exon skipping benchmark experiment  <dig> out of the  <dig> groups of spike-in genes  were used. we focused on those because they were all part of the exon  <dig>  st core annotation subset. the overall idea of the generation of synthetic exon skipping events is based on the availability of exon-level signals for spike-in genes. therefore, it is possible to create new genes characterized by skipping events combining, for the same gene, exon-level expressions derived from different spike-in concentrations. an example is given in figure 1a, where the combination of  <dig> and  <dig> pm spike-in signals for gene g <dig> are used for the generation of  <dig> new genes each one characterized by a skipping event in one of the  <dig> exons of gene g <dig> 

in our semi-synthetic data set the new genes, characterized by skipping events, are generated using different associations of spike-in concentrations to evaluate the effect of signal intensity in the detection of alternative splicing. for each exon of the  <dig> genes we produced three sets of synthetic exon skipping events: 128- <dig>  32- <dig>  2- <dig>  specifically in the exon skipping set called 128- <dig> any of the new genes has all exons signals given by the log2intensity  measured upon a spike-in of  <dig> pm unless the exon skipped, which has the log2i measured upon a spike-in of  <dig> pm . the gene-level log2i is instead the one measured for the  <dig> pm spike-in . same design applies to the other two sets of exon skipping events, 32- <dig> and 2- <dig> 

this semi-synthetic benchmark experiment embeds a total of  <dig> exon skipping events. furthermore, the skipping events were manually inspected, in each of the three exon-skipping sets , in order to retain only those genes where the skipping event represents the smallest intensity signal or splice index  within each synthetic gene . this cleaning procedure yields:

• a total of  <dig> skipping events out of the original  <dig> for the 128- <dig> group,  <dig> for the 32- <dig> group and  <dig> for the group 2- <dig>  if intensity data are used.

• a total of  <dig> skipping events out of the original  <dig> for the 128- <dig> group,  <dig> for the 32- <dig> group and  <dig> for the group 2- <dig>  if si data are used.

to identify exon-skipping events a comparison between two different conditions, i.e. unspliced versus spliced, is needed. detection of exon-skipping events for the subset 128- <dig> was done comparing it to the unspliced set spiked-in at  <dig> pm , for the subset 32- <dig> comparing it to the unspliced set spiked-in at  <dig> pm  and for the subset 2- <dig> comparing it to the unspliced set spiked-in at  <dig> pm . these comparisons embed a certain level of differential expression at gene level. the expected gene-level differential expression is given by log <dig> = - <dig> for the comparison of the  <dig> versus the 128- <dig> subset and by log <dig> = - <dig> for the comparison  <dig> versus 32- <dig> subset. it is instead log <dig> = - <dig> for the comparison  <dig> versus 2- <dig> subset.

rma versus plier summarization
rma and plier algorithms were used to combine the intensities belonging to the probes of each probe set to form one expression measure for each gene/exon-level probe set . the effect of these summarization methods on detection of alternative splicing events was investigated using midas. a receiver operating characteristic  curve was used to evaluate the effect of intensity summaries on alternative splicing detection . our data suggest that the efficacy of detecting exon skipping events is not affected by summarization methods. on the other hand the reduction of the complexity of the data set, e.g. selecting only those ensembl  <cit>  genes associated with more than one transcript isoform , strongly increases the sensitivity of the test .

filtering approaches to moderate multiple testing errors
a critical issue, highlighted in fig.  <dig>  is the important number of multiple testing errors that are accumulated if the full set of exon  <dig>  core data is used for the detection of ases. to moderate this critical issue, we decided to reduce the complexity of the data set filtering non-informative data  before statistical analysis, using annotation and intensity based filters.

cross hybridization filter
we investigated the effect of removing those probe sets characterized by a certain level of probe promiscuity among transcribed sequences . specifically, using the exon-level probe set annotation information provided by affymetrix, we removed all probe sets where all the probes in the probe set perfectly match more than one sequence in the putatively transcribed array design content as well as those where the probes either perfectly match or partially match more than one sequence in the putatively transcribed array design content. this filter could have an important effect on the correct association of the gene expression signal. however, it affects a very limited number of exon-level probe sets and therefore it does not produce an important reduction of the size of non-informative data . true positives , i.e. the semi-synthetic skipped genes previously described, are not affected by this filter since their exon-level probe sets are not annotated within the cross-hybridizing probe sets.

dabg filter
the effects of filtering by means of annotation  or intensity signal  are evaluated using exon-skipping events at various concentrations.

multiple mrnas filter
this filter uses the affymetrix annotation that links each gene-level probe set to a specific genebank  accession number , which represents the target sequence used to design the probes associated to a gene-level probe set. then, entrez gene ids  are retrieved querying with these accs a specific organism oriented bioconductor  annotation package . egs are used to query ensembl database and all ensembl transcripts associated to any of them are retrieved. subsequently, the filter procedure retains only those egs associated to more than one ensembl transcript. the egs, retained by this filtering procedure, are mapped again to their gene-level probe sets.

multiple mrnas filter strongly reduces the number of core exons because it retains only exons of genes which are linked to multiple transcripts in the ensembl database and for this reason it results to be more effective than the other filters as shown both in table  <dig> and in figure  <dig>  the new genes, with skipping events, generated in our data set are not affected by this filter since they do not exist in nature.

dabg filter
in exon  <dig>  st genechips, to determine if a given probe signal is detected above background , its intensity is compared to a distribution of background probes with the same g/c content. a p-value  is computed representing the probability that the signal intensity is part of the null distribution. specifically the dabg p-value filter, used in this work, is designed to retain only probe sets characterized by a dabg p-value ≤  <dig>  in all the arrays. although this filter reduces the data set under analysis , it is much less effective than multiple mrnas filter . increasing the stringency of this filter affects the total number of non-informative data , which is reduced, but also part of the tps are lost. dabg p-values could be useful in the detection and removal of low intensity signals which could produce misleading results when alternative splicing events are evaluated using the splice index, where signal intensity component is lost to remove the bias due to the presence of gene-level differential expression. however, in our data set a filter based on this approach is much less effective than that based on multiple mrnas filter .

efficacy of midas and rank product  in the detection of alternative splicing events
we evaluated the efficacy of the detection of alternative splicing events , using a linear model based algorithm  and a permutation based algorithm . midas was applied on si transformed data as rp was applied instead using si, rpsi, or directly to exon intensity signals, rpi. rp was implemented both at gene-level and exon-level. gene-level implementation of rp indicates that the analysis is performed gene by gene and the permutations are generated within the list of exons of the same gene. exon-level implementation of rp considers instead exons as items of a unique list, independent from their association with a gene. the exon-level implementation of rp has better sensitivity than that of the gene-level version  and is faster since permutations are calculated only once and not gene by gene.

both midas and rp seem to be effective in the detection of alternative splicing events independently from the presence of a certain level of gene differential expression and with limited dependency on gene-level intensity . rp seems to perform slightly better than midas. rpi  gives the most homogeneous results independently of the intensity signals associated with ases . independently from the statistics in use, at p-value ≤  <dig>   the tps detection is reasonably efficient for both methods, but is associated with a significant amount of false positive values . we also evaluated, at the three intensity ranges under study, the number of tps and fps that can be detected intersecting all probe sets characterized by a p-value ≤  <dig>  both for midas and rp . the integration of the two statistical procedures improves the reduction of fps without greatly affecting the sensitivity .

rpi is the rank product calculated using the intensity signals without si calculation. statistical analyses done using midas or rpi, calculated using intensity signals, at p-value ≤  <dig>  are contaminated by a significant number of fps due to the multiple test problem. the intersection of the results using the two methods significantly reduces the number of fps.

discussion
the availability of a new instrument to study the behaviour of transcription isoforms within a specific biological context, e.g. different cancer isolates, tissues, and differentiation/development stages, creates new opportunities for biologists. however, workflow for the detection of alternative splicing events using this new microarray technology has still to be investigated in order to define the importance of each analysis step and its strength and weakness. our data point out that a major problem in ases detection is due to the multiple testing problem. in statistics, family-wise error rate  is the probability of making one or more false discoveries  among all the hypotheses when performing multiple pairwise tests. since fwer controlling procedures are often too conservative in high dimensional screening studies  <cit> , they are rather weak if applied to exon-level analysis where the number of tests increases more than  <dig> times with respect to gene-level. for example, the human core data set is made of  <dig> gene-level probe sets and  <dig> exon-level probe sets. a better balance between the raw p-values and the stringent fwer-adjusted p-values may be provided by false discovery rate controlling and related procedures  <cit> . benjamini and hochberg  <cit>  and benjamini and yekutieli  <cit>  have developed efficient false discovery rate controlling procedures currently called bh and by. however, such approaches cannot be used to moderate multiple testing problems in exon-level analysis since, generally, the raw p-value distribution obtained with midas is not uniform in the non significant range. furthermore, in the case of bh, the assumption that the tests are independent is not fulfilled since exons belonging to the same gene are clearly correlated. on the basis of the impracticality of applying conventional methods to moderate fwer, the reduction  of the data set size of previous statistical testing is, in our opinion, mandatory. our data point out that a significant reduction of the data set size can be realized by considering only probe sets associated with at least two alternative spliced isoforms in the ensembl database . however, this approach limits the strength of the analysis since it cannot be applied in the case of the identification of non-annotated isoforms. if a study focuses on the discovery of non-annotated isoforms, an intensity filter, e.g. dabg p-values filter, can be used although its effect is not as strong as that based on annotation . in this case, it would be necessary to clean the results of the large amounts of false positives, validating data by using alternative technologies such as the high-throughput re-sequencing techniques, e.g. solexa  or solid . these would however increase the complexity of the analysis due to the high computational demands of these techniques. we also investigated the performance of two statistical methods, one based on linear model analysis , developed by affymetrix for the detection of ases, and another non-parametric . both methods, applied at exon-level and thus not taking into consideration the association of an exon to a specific gene, perform quite well in the detection of the true exon skipping events embedded in our data set . the amount of fps associated to an arbitrary p-value threshold of  <dig>  is in both cases very high  and the application of a more stringent p-value threshold reduces the number of fps but also impacts negatively on tp rate . however, since the two statistics used for ases detection are based on completely different assumptions, it is feasible that random events  contaminating the tps will not be the same. therefore, the intersection of the results obtained by both statistics, given an arbitrary p-value threshold, effectively reduces fps . since at the present time statistics specifically devoted to the detection of ases which also address the multiple test problem are not available, our approach represents an efficient temporary solution for moderating fwer.

CONCLUSIONS
the semi-synthetic data set presented here represents a suitable instrument for testing the efficacy of new statistics for exon-level analysis. furthermore, it allowed us to test the efficacy of a basic workflow  for ases using a genechip exon  <dig>  st platform. however, our data highlights that more work is needed to design powerful instruments for ase detection which must take into account the multiple testing problem.
