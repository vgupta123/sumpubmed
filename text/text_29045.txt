BACKGROUND
mangrove communities are composed of phylogenetically unrelated species, each adapted in different ways to the coastal environment where high salinity, diurnal patterns of submergence, wave action, and frequent disturbance create high stress environments
 <cit> . mangrove forests have an extended tropical and subtropical geographic distribution during the last  <dig> my
 <cit> . they are also among the most biologically productive forests and provide key ecosystem services such as breeding grounds for fish, shrimp, and birds and function to protect coasts from tidal surges during hurricanes or extreme weather
 <cit> . however, mangrove forests are being destroyed and fragmented at alarmingly high rates in the tropics due to human development
 <cit> . moreover, mangrove forests may be particularly susceptible to increasing sea levels
 <cit> . the ability of mangroves to adapt and regenerate in the face of disturbance and changing environmental conditions is therefore dependent upon rates of local and long distance dispersal, colonization and genetic diversity found within and among populations.

in most trees, it is generally assumed that rates of pollen gene dispersal are greater, and often much greater, than rates of gene flow via seed. however, several lines of evidence suggest that mangrove species are capable of frequent long distance seed dispersal  on scales of many km that may exceed rates of gene flow via pollen. for example, exceptionally high levels of gene flow have been reported between west africa and south america at scales >  <dig>  km
 <cit> . in addition, mark and recapture experiments in ocean currents in the caribbean and in the gulf of mexico have revealed high dispersal potential for mangrove seeds
 <cit> . direct measurements at very local scales within mature mangrove forests have shown very short seed dispersal distances i.e. less than  <dig> m in two weeks,
 <cit> . therefore, the extent of gene flow via seed observed among populations may be due to the frequency at which seeds encounter large open ocean currents when dispersed from more isolated estuaries where water flow is largely due to diurnal tidal action.

a comparison between the extent of pollen vs. seed gene flow in mangroves would improve our understanding of mangrove population structure and reveal the contribution of each to observed spatial patterns of genetic structure
 <cit> . in this study, we compare patterns of nuclear and plastid genetic structure in the two dominant mangrove species from the new world, the black mangrove  and the red mangrove , across the four main estuaries of panama within a scale up to  <dig> km along same coastline . the focal species currently occur in sympatry on both sides of the central american isthmus  but have different historical biogeographies. rhizophora mangle has been present in the neotropics for  <dig> my while a. germinans has been present since  <dig> my
 <cit> . the two species have contrasting patterns of life-history traits and current demography. avicennia germinans has an entomophilous pollination system with polyphile , whereas r. mangle is characterized by a simultaneous wind  and entomophilous pollination, termed ambophilous pollination
 <cit> . although the two mangrove species have perfect flowers, the breeding mechanism seems to be different
 <cit> . the protandry observed in a. germinans suggest a mostly outcrossing breeding system, however self-compatibility has not been tested yet in this species
 <cit> . in comparison, r. mangle shows a mixed-mating breeding system where self-pollination could be more frequent
 <cit> . avicennia germinans has small light ovoid crypto-viviparous propagules with longevity of four months while r. mangle seeds are large, elongate and viviparous with longevity of one year
 <cit> . in addition, while r. mangle is the only species from the genus rhizophora to inhabit the caribbean coast of panama, on the pacific side it is in sympatry with r. racemosa, generating introgressive hybrid zones where morphological and genetic distinctions between species and hybrids are intricate
 <cit> . finally, populations of a. germinans have a patchy, low-density distribution  compared to r. mangle populations, which have a more uniform distribution with extremely high densities 
 <cit> . previous analyses of a. germinans have reported high levels of genetic diversity of this species on the pacific side of cai, including panama
 <cit> .

based on these life-history characteristics and previous reports of seed dispersal capacity, we expected that: i) both species would display low genetic structure or little evidence for isolation by distance  within estuaries and ii) both species would have a higher rate of seed gene flow than pollen gene flow because of their capacity for ldd via sea-drift seeds
 <cit> . in addition, at the species level comparison we expected that avicennia germinans would have greater degree of population differentiation than r. mangle because a combination of lower seed longevity and viability in ocean water, insect pollen dispersal mechanism, and low-density distribution
 <cit> .

RESULTS
genetic differentiation and mating systems
despite differences in many life history characteristics, the two species did not show significant differences in levels of genetic structure , inbreeding  or outcrossing rates   . both species showed deviations from hwe, but only r. mangle showed evidence of linkage disequilibrium. these deviations could be explained by deme structure within estuaries that we explained below.

the estimates of gst were calculed using the hamilton and miller’s method  and the ennos’s method  in avicennia germinans  and rhizophora mangle  across four panamanian estuaries. the comparison of fst, fis and outcrossing level  between a. germinans and r. mangle did not show significant differences between species .

general patterns of diversity among four estuaries
both species showed striking differences in genetic diversity. avicennia germinans showed considerable variation in microsatellite alleles among four estuaries, with the highest he observed in the caribbean costa arriba estuary  and lowest in the pacific san miguel gulf . in contrast, r. mangle showed lower overall gene diversity in caribbean populations  relative to pacific estuaries , however, no significant differences in outcrossing rates within species were observed among estuaries . the higher gene diversity and number of alleles in pacific estuaries of r. mangle is complicated by the complex hybridization evident in both pacific estuaries , which serves as a novel source of genetic diversity in pacific populations
 <cit> .

chloroplast dna also revealed striking patterns in diversity and structure in these two species when comparing among estuaries. rhizophora mangle has a single fixed haplotype in the caribbean coast that include bocas del toro and costa arriba estuaries , and only two haplotypes in the pacific  for a total of three haplotypes. the opposite trend was observed in a. germinans, which showed remarkably high genetic diversity of cpdna haplotypes with  <dig> haplotypes observed from  <dig> individuals. for this species, the haplotype diversity was similar among four estuaries . finally, no cpdna haplotypes were shared between coasts for either species .

hierarchical structure of genetic variation based on microsatellites
we found evidence of similar levels of genetic structure between species overall . in addition, both species showed that majority of microsatellite variation is partitioned within estuaries  with differences among estuaries accounting for most of the remaining variation . thus, pairwise comparison of estuaries separated by the ocean showed exceptionally high levels of differentiation with pairwise fst ranged between  <dig>  to  <dig>  in a. germinans and between  <dig>  to  <dig>  in r. mangle. corrected estimates of fst by null allele presence were highly similar to non-corrected fst values putatively harboring null alleles .

analysis of species avicennia germinans  and rhizophora mangle  was performed comparing four estuaries of panama based on microsatellite and cpdna polymorphism.

the amova was performed using  <dig>  permutations in arlequin  <dig> . it is indicated the fst values derived from both microsatellite  and cpdna data  for each pairwise comparison across estuaries. the asterkisk indicate p <  <dig> , after bonferroni corrections. underlined values represent the unbiased fst estimates following the ena method that correct by the presence of null alleles on fst estimation .

in spite of these similar strong structures across oceans and estuaries, both species showed differences in how genetic diversity is subdivided between estuaries from the same coast. pairwise fst indicates that population differentiation is lower between estuaries in the caribbean coast than between estuaries in the pacific coast .

the bayesian structure analysis supports differences in how structure is organized at two levels  between estuaries from the same coastal line and  within estuaries. avicennia germinans, with the exception of the costa arriba estuary, shows evidence of two demes within each one of the other three estuaries . in comparison, r. mangle showed evidence of three demes within each one of the two pacific estuaries but only one extended population across caribbean coastline without any differentiation between bocas del toro and costa arriba estuaries and without any substructure within each one of these two estuaries .

at level  within estuaries, the two mangrove species showed statistically significant negative slopes  in the kinship-distance curves . the strength of spatial genetic structure  measured by sp statistics for the whole estuary is identical if we compare it with sp of each deme inferred within the estuary. the exception was the montijo gulf estuary for both a. germinans and r. mangle. in both cases, sp calculated for whole estuary was higher than when sp was calculated for each deme within that estuary. in spite of that, we did not find differences in sp values across seven a. germinans’s demes distributed in the four estuaries . however, one of the r. mangle’s demes localized in san miguel gulf  showed a stronger sgs compared to only one r. mangle deme shared between estuaries from caribbean coastal line   .

it is indicated the slopes  of the regression of kinship coefficient values on the natural logarithm of distance  for each estuary, the coefficient of determination r <dig>  the average and standard error  of the kinship coefficient among individuals separated by less than  <dig> m   for each estuary, and the intensity of sgs  calculated for pairwise distance among individuals up to  <dig> km within each estuary is shown. when geneland detected spatial genetic discontinuities within estuaries, the sgs parameters were recalculated for each genetic cluster when n >  <dig>  each one of the genetic clusters were named based on color assignation from figure
 <dig> including pink , malachite green  and orange  within caribbean estuaries and yellow , purple , tourmaline green , lapis lazuli  and red  in pacific estuaries.

***p< <dig> ; **p< <dig> ; *p< <dig> .

the extent of sgs of two mangrove species was also different. avicennia germinans showed a range of kinship values almost ten times higher than r. mangle. sgs was greater in a. germinans  than for r. mangle  across demes with n >  <dig> on scales up to  <dig> km  .

hierarchical structure of genetic variation in cpdna
avicennia germinans has lower genetic structure at the cpdna level  relative to r. mangle  . however, hierarchical organization of genetic structure of the two species at cpdna shows more similar patterns than those inferred by nuclear microsatellites. in a. germinans, both caribbean and pacific coast samples showed strong structure between estuaries, . however, some haplotypes were shared between estuaries along same coastline but separated by ~ <dig> km. in contrast, all r. mangle individuals shared a single haplotype on the caribbean coast, while on the pacific side although both estuaries shared the same two haplotypes; strong genetic population structure existed between montijo gulf and san miguel gulf  . most of the genetic variation in cpdna genome is partitioned among ocean basins, with 67% for a. germinans and 33% of the variation partitioned within estuaries . rhizophora mangle shows a similar pattern with 56% of the variation partitioned among oceans and 44% within estuaries . contrary to what was observed across microsatellites, the sgs analysis based on cpdna did not show significant slopes within each one of the four panamanian estuaries analyzed, perhaps due to limited sample size .

comparison of pollen and seed migration rates
in a. germinans the pollen-to-seed gene flow ratio was negative, or basically zero , which indicates one to two times higher gene flow via hydrochorious seed dispersal than entomophilous dispersed pollen gene flow. in comparison, the ratio obtained in r. mangle indicates approximately seven times higher ambophilous pollen gene flow than hydrochorious seed gene flow . however, because the confidence limits of each species overlap with the expected value of equal seed and pollen flow, we could not reject the null hypothesis of mpollen = mseed gene flow in either species .

discussion
mangrove communities are critically important ecosystems that are high in aquatic and terrestrial biological diversity in tropical and subtropical ecosystems worldwide
 <cit> . today they are threatened by high rates of anthropogenic disturbance, including habitat destruction, pollution, fragmentation, and changes in oceanic and estuarine environments due to climate change
 <cit> . the goal of this study was to document spatial genetic structure of two dominant neotropical mangrove species at three spatial levels  among four estuaries in panama  between two estuaries from same coastal line and  within each one of the four estuaries. these data provide critical information to understanding how genetic diversity is structured and maintained within mangrove species and communities.

both mangrove species showed a strong genetic break across the cai. however, the patterns of diversity observed in this study were the opposite of what we had expected for both species. we found significant differences between estuaries from same coastline and also ibd within estuaries in both mangrove species. in addition, both mangrove species showed comparable outcrossing rates, contrary to other reports on their mating systems. further, a. germinans showed much higher levels of genetic diversity, especially in plastid genomes, than r. mangle, in spite of the fact that r. mangle populations have a more continuous distribution. finally, although there is documented evidence for extreme ldd in both mangrove species, our evidence mostly indicates restricted gene dispersal overall and largely equivalent rates of seed and pollen dispersal. below, we interpret the observed population genetic differences of these species as well as the combined effects of species’ life histories, gene dispersal limitation, and biogeographic history.

the ecological imprint on genetic structure: mating system and pollen vs. seed movement
the two mangrove species showed strong genetic structure across four estuaries analyzed, including evidence of substructure and ibd within estuaries. nevertheless, the patterns of genetic structure were very different between species. microsatellites revealed lower gene diversity and lower genetic structure in r. mangle than a. germinans. this contradicts the predictions based upon an outcrossing mating system where assumed outcrossing species, such as a. germinans, are expected to have lower genetic structure than the mixed-mating r. mangle <cit> .

the protandry reported in a. germinans is the main evidence that supports an outcrossing mating system in this species because the flower-developing mechanism makes autogamy unlikely 
 <cit> . however, absence of self-pollination  is not equivalent to self-incompatibility because pollination could ocurr between different flowers on the same plant . other avicennia species from indo-west pacific region including a. marina and a. officinalis show this pattern
 <cit> . there is no direct evidence of self-incompatibility in a. germinans that we know of. it is possible that the patchy spatial distribution of a. germinans populations observed in panama has an effect on the levels of outcrossing and therefore on the genetic structure in this species. in isolated individuals or low density populations geitonogamy could be an advantageous breeding system
 <cit> . moreover, the r=− <dig>  estimates of pollen vs. seed flow suggests that although seed dispersal is likely equivalent to pollen dispersal in a. germinans, in a patchy matrix, this seed dispersal still is usually very local, leading to greater biparental inbreeding, and increasing population genetic differentiation and spatial genetic structure in nuclear genomes
 <cit> .

our data also suggest that historically ambophilous pollen dispersal mechanism of r. mangle has been more efficient promoting outcrossing and long-distance gene flow than entomophilous pollination system of a. germinans. based on previous genetic studies, it is predicted to have higher dispersal potential and therefore low genetic structure in species with wind pollination system over species with insect pollinator system
 <cit> . however, reproductive biology studies in other ambophilous species suggest a completely opposite trend indicating that in self-compatible species as is the case of r. mangle, wind is actually the mechanism that promotes selfing and that out-crossing is associated with insect pollen distribution. the reason is that abiotic mechisms as wind do not target distant receptive flowers as efficiently as insects
 <cit> .

although we do not know the rates of wind-to-insect pollen dispersal in r. mangle, the ratios of pollen-to-seed dispersal of r= <dig>  estimated in this study are lower than those estimated in exclusively wind-dispersed plants . in addition, based on the hamilton and miller’s method calculations, pollen vs. seed was not significantly different from each other meaning that ambophilous pollen dispersal is less efficient than exclusively anemophilous pollen dispersal and/or that seed dispersal in this species is comparatively higher than in other exclusively wind pollinated species.

the contrast of seed viability between the two species may also have a strong influence in levels of genetic structure. rhizophora mangle species have the highest longevity seeds of any mangrove genus
 <cit> . direct experiments regarding establishment of seeds after long periods of floating exposure in sea water have showed a 60% success rate after  <dig> days floating for r. mangle, higher than any other rhizophoracea species
 <cit> . there is no similar quantitative data on establishment success after dispersal for a. germinans; however, its seed longevity is shorter than r. mangle <cit> . the local genetic structure observed in panama largely corroborates this pattern, especially in the caribbean, where two estuaries separated by  <dig> km showed identical chloroplast and nuclear genetic diversity in r. mangle but strong structure in a. germinans. although a. germinans showed evidence of shared cpdna haplotypes among estuaries on the same coast, there are also some cpdna haplotypes and nuclear alleles that are restricted to each estuary, generating strong structure, even within estuaries. thus, in a variable estuarine environment where seed movement is stochastic
 <cit> , our data suggests that higher propagule longevity leads to a greater chance of successful establishing at long distances, increasing gene flow and decreasing population structure
 <cit> .

the historical imprint on genetic structure
the isthmus of panama represents a  <dig> my to three my old barrier to seed gene flow between the atlantic and pacific oceans, and is the narrowest terrestrial area in the new world that separates mangrove populations in each ocean
 <cit> . based on microsatellite and chloroplast genetic diversity observed across the isthmus, this land mass has created high levels of genetic structure and a strong barrier for contemporary seed gene flow. moreover, our results indicate that the isthmus also represents a strong barrier to pollen flow in each species. this is likely due to the absence of a continuous terrestrial population that spans the entire distance between coasts. thus, the strong isolating effect that the rise of the cai has had on population differentiation for these two and other species highlights the role of restricted seed dispersal in creating spatial genetic structure in hydrochorious marine species
 <cit> .

population differentiation observed between different oceans is exceptionally high compared to other tropical tree species. for example, dick and huertz
 <cit>  report an average fst=  <dig>  for microsatellites variation from the neotropical tree symphonia globulifera. within panama, s. globulifera averaged fst =  <dig>  for samples taken across the isthmus of panama, which is within the range of observations that we see when comparisons are made within oceans for the mangrove species here. however, even trans-andean fst between mesoamerican populations of bird pollinated, mammal dispersal s. globulifera and those in the amazon separated by >  <dig>  km showed maximum fst =  <dig> , still lower than lowest pairwise fst for a. germinans made between trans-isthmian populations of montijo gulf and costa arriba  separated by <  <dig> km. furthermore, populations of insect pollinated and wind dispersed mahogany  across mesoamerica also show a lower overall fst =  <dig> , with the largest pairwise differences  observed between panamanian and guatemalan populations at a distance of >  <dig>  km
 <cit> .

in spite of similar effects of cai in the genetic structure of these two mangroves, we found unexpectedly high levels of cpdna diversity and structure in a. germinans that suggests a level of diversity that could be more influenced by population history and demography than current gene flow
 <cit> . the cpdna diversity observed in a. germinans is remarkable given the small sample size and short geographic distances separating the populations both within and between coasts. this high level of diversity could be indicative of historical processes determining spatial genetic structure of populations. although the fossil record of mangroves in pleistocene is scarce and therefore the reconstruction of current mangrove distribution is very speculative, several lines of evidence suggest that mangrove ecosystem were under episodic crises during the quaternary, specially associated to sea-level and temperature/humidity fluctuations
 <cit> . in particular, it is possible that current populations of a. germinans represent remnants of refugial populations created during the pleistocene
 <cit> . in fact, panamanian populations are genetically diverse compared to other regions, and it has been suggested that both ancient introgressive hybridization and secondary contact between a. germinans and its sister species a. bicolor has occurred in panama , generating a hotspot of genetic diversity
 <cit> .

our results in a. germinans contrast strongly with r. mangle, where very little cpdna diversity was observed. these two species differ in their density and distribution, with r. mangle forming extremely dense, continuous forests near to shore, and a. germinans forming patchily distributed, lower-density stands at low and middle intertidal zones. one hypothesis that could explain the current distribution of cpdna diversity is that mangrove populations represent relicts of much larger ancestral populations but that after pleistocene-holocene sea-level fluctuations, the mangrove composition shifted to a r. mangle -dominated community
 <cit> . under this scenario, r. mangle could have resulted in a more efficient colonizer than a. germinans follow a stepping-stone dispersion pattern. this process combined with self-fertilization observed in r. mangle could be the responsible of the current continous and dense populations and the low cpdna and nuclear diversity observed in this species
 <cit> . alternatively, it is also possible that only certain older lineages of r. mangle that are well adapted to current conditions survived in the pleistocene-holocene sea-level fluctiations and that only those exclusive lineages recolonized available habitats during the holocene or that longer time of r. mangle presence in neotropics generated more lost of diversity via genetic drift than younger a. germinans.

regardless of the explanation, a. germinans joins the ranks of tropical tree species in panama that show complex biogeographic history with disproportionately high levels of cpdna diversity relative to other parts of their range
 <cit> . the historical complexity of panama was also evident when we analyzed the geographical variation in structure with greater population differentiation in pacific versus caribbean estuaries for both species in nuclear and plastid genetic markers. in the case of r. mangle, introgressive hybridization between r. mangle and its sister species, r. racemosa, is a novel source of genetic variation exclusive to the pacific
 <cit> . thus, the levels of genetic structures and patterns of biodiversity in r. mangle are completely different between caribbean and pacific due to independent historical processes in the occurrence and sympatry of r. mangle and r. racemosa.

the influence of coastal morphology
hydrochory per se is assumed to be one of the most efficient mechanisms for ldd in plants. therefore, it is expected that hydrochorious plant species should have high gene flow among populations and low genetic structure, especially in local geographic areas
 <cit> . our data contradict this hypothesis because the two mangrove species resulted genetically structured among and within estuaries, indicating local restrictions to both pollen and seed dispersal, especially in a. germinans species. currently, one of the major threats in mangroves is fragmentation and sea-level changes associated with climate changes
 <cit> . historically, both mangrove species have experimented sea-level fluctuations at several times and climate changes
 <cit> , thus, our results suggest that historically r. mangle have maintained more gene dispersal of both pollen and seed dispersal than a. germinans. however, our results also suggested that geographic location is important in predicting levels of genetic structure in mangroves. pacific populations proved to be more structured than caribbean populations in both mangrove species. one possible explanation is biological. the pacific coast has been characterized by ancient hybridization between a. germinans and a. bicolor, but there is also the current scenario of introgressive hybridization between r. mangle and r. racemosa. both hybridization processes are apparently complicating current levels of structure compared with caribbean populations
 <cit> . the other possible explanation is abiotic, including basin geomorphology and connectivity due to ocean currents. our results suggest that current or historical landscape characteristics of pacific estuaries are in some way enhancing pollen and seed dispersal limitations, generating more structure compared to caribbean estuaries. similarly, the density of a. germinans is very variable and in some places, for example in french guiana a. germinans could be more dense and extended than r. mangle <cit> . in consequence, patterns of genetic structure among and within estuaries in that region could be completely different to observed in panama. thus, although life-history traits are important to predict expected genetic structure, landscape settings are generating a variety of situations on local scales that complicate any prediction in terms of expected levels of genetic structure
 <cit> . therefore, although long distance gene flow between south america and west africa has been observed in both a. germinans and r. mangle <cit> , estuarine geomorphology and ocean currents in panama, especially on the pacific side, seem to be more complex, preventing pollen and seed dispersal.

methods
study sites and sampling strategy
we collected leaf samples from a. germinans and r. mangle trees within the four largest estuaries in panama: bocas del toro and costa arriba in the caribbean and montijo gulf and san miguel gulf in the pacific . within each estuary, we selected ten equidistant sites across the geographic contour for sampling. the sampling sites included rivers, streams, channels and shoreline areas, each with riverine or fringe mangrove forests. within each sampling site we established transects parallel to the water's edge, and randomly selected a maximum of  <dig> adult trees for each mangrove species with a dbh ≥  <dig> cm and spaced with a minimum distance of  <dig> m between sampled trees. all selected trees were geo-referenced using a gps or a compass and measuring tape.

microsatellite analysis
we used  <dig> and  <dig> microsatellite loci for the analysis of  <dig> a. germinans individuals and  <dig> r. mangle individuals respectively, following established protocols
 <cit>  but with modifications
 <cit>  . we calculated the average number of alleles per locus, observed heterozygosity , expected heterozygosity , and the fixation index  for each species across the four estuaries using genalex  <dig> 
 <cit> . in addition, we calculated the outcrossing rate by hand as 1 = fis/1 + fis <cit> . for each locus, we tested deviations from hardy-weinberg equilibrium  and linkage equilibrium  with genepop  <dig> 
 <cit> . also, we tested for the presence of null alleles and scoring problems associated with allelic stuttering or allelic dropout using microchecker  <dig> .3
 <cit> . this analysis found no stutter bands or genotyping errors across microsatellites. however, some loci showed a positive presence of null alleles, ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>  in a. germinans and from − <dig>  to  <dig>  in r. mangle .

we compared the hierarchical genetic structure of a. germinans and r. mangle at three geographic levels:  among four estuaries,  between two estuaries along same coastline and  within estuaries. for  among estuaries, we used a fst based amova
 <cit>  in arlequin  <dig> 
 <cit>  after  <dig>  permutations. we compare this result with the ena method implemented in freena <cit>  to correct the bias induced by the presence of null alleles on the fst estimation after  <dig>  replicates . for levels  between two estuaries along same coastline and  within estuaries we used structure  <dig> 
 <cit> , geneland  <dig> .4
 <cit>  and, for mixed-mated r. mangle, instruct
 <cit>  .

in structure  <dig>  we assumed an admixed model and a uniform prior probability of the number of populations, k. all the runs were performed with  <dig>  mcmc replicates after a burn-in of  <dig>  replicates. we used a model of correlated allele frequencies varying the level of structure from k =  <dig> to  <dig> populations. ten independent runs were done for each value of k to generate our estimate of the true number of demes
 <cit> . previous empirical and simulation analysis using structure showed that null allele presence have a low effect in the accuracy of assignment tests
 <cit> . this effect was moderate even in populations with a frequency of null alleles >  <dig>  for a single locus
 <cit> . therefore we performed the structure  <dig> . analysis with no correction to the raw data to account for null alleles. nevertheless, the geneland  <dig> . <dig>  analysis was performed using a explicit null alleles presence model as we explain below.

the geneland  <dig> . <dig> model assumes that population membership is structured across space. thus, if this assumption is correct, the power of inferring clusters based upon the combination of genetic and geographical information increases compared with using structure alone
 <cit> . however, in the case of weak spatial organization, the inferred structure of geneland is expected to be similar to structure inference
 <cit> . for each run in geneland, we used the spatial d-model to calculate allele frequencies and set the maximum rate of the poisson process and the maximum number of nuclei  according to the total number of individuals collected within each coast. in addition, we set an uncertainty attached to spatial coordinates fixed to  <dig> m. we performed ten independent runs of geneland allowing k to vary from 1– <dig> populations using the simultaneously uncorrelated allele frequency model, the spatial model, and the null allele model due to the presence of null alleles detected in both mangrove species . we completed  <dig>  iterations for each independent run, saving every 10th iteration using a burn-in of  <dig>  iterations. finally, as mating systems may be different between the two species under study and selfing rates could influence deme structure in mixed-mating species, we used instruct to infer simultaneously the selfing rates of r. mangle and its genetic structure at two levels:  between two estuaries along same coastline and  within estuaries. in instruct, hwe is not assumed as it is in structure; rather the expected genotype frequencies are calculated based on selfing rates. we ran five independent chains, each chain having  <dig>  iterations steps,  <dig>  burn-in iterations, a thinning interval of  <dig> and assuming a dirichlet process of mixture.

spatial genetic structure within estuaries
we investigated spatial genetic structure  at level  within estuaries using a spatial autocorrelation analysis
 <cit> . for this analysis, we calculated the pairwise kinship coefficient between all individuals  separated at different distance classes following
 <cit>  up to  <dig> km. kinship coefficients  were regressed using the logarithm of the spatial distance between individuals  within each one of the estuaries analyzed. standard errors were assessed by jackknifing data over each locus. we generated uneven lags with constant number of individuals inside distance classes  with > 90% of pairwise relationships among nearest neighbors included within the first interval. using spagedi  <dig> 
 <cit> , we calculated the regressions of kinship coefficients  vs. natural logarithm of distance classes  to provide the regression slope . we tested the significance of sgs and the ibd in two dimensions using the observed slope  of the linear regression of the kinship coefficient on the logarithm of the distance class against the null hypothesis ho: bld =  <dig>  by comparing the observed values with those obtained after  <dig>  permutations of individuals between locations. where geneland detected a spatial deme within an estuary, this procedure was applied to each inferred deme that was represented by at least  <dig> individuals, excluding admixed individuals.

to compare the extent of sgs between the two mangrove species over the same geographic scales and across different estuaries, we calculated the sp statistics on spatial scales of up to  <dig> km. the sp statistics were calculated from the slope of the regression  of the kinship coefficient  against the logarithm of the distance, sp = − bl10km/ where the regression slope, bl10km, is less than  <dig> km and fa is the average kinship coefficient between individuals belonging to the first distance class . this first distance class included all pairs of neighbors
 <cit> . in the cases where we found demes within estuaries we repeated this procedure for each one of the subpopulations if n >  <dig> 

chloroplast analysis
a subsample of  <dig> individuals of a. germinans and  <dig> individuals of r. mangle and distributed across the four estuaries  was sequenced using two chloroplast  non-coding regions atpi-atph and psbj-peta <cit> . we redesigned primers to avoid short-repeat regions and improve sequence quality in all regions except for the atpi-atph region in a. germinans <cit> . modified primers for the psbj-peta region in a. germinans were f: agattgatcgatatcgggttc and r: ggaaaaccgaaacccagac. modified primers for r. mangle analysis, pcr and sequencing specifications for both species were described previously
 <cit> . for each mangrove species we calculated the haplotype diversity using dnasp  <dig> 
 <cit> . in addition we constructed a median joining network
 <cit>  for the combined cpdna regions using network  <dig> . <dig>  . we calculated population structure using arlequin  <dig> 
 <cit>  at level  among four estuaries and  between two estuaries from same coastal line. finally, we used spagedi  <dig> 
 <cit>  to investigate sgs at level  within estuaries, using a spatial autocorrelation analysis of cpdna variation. for this analysis, we calculated the pairwise kinship analogue coefficient between all individuals based on the genetic distances between haplotypes  separated at different distance classes vs. natural logarithm of distance classes  to provide the regression slope  on spatial scales up to  <dig> km in a procedure similar to that used for microsatellites
 <cit> .

comparison of pollen and seed migration rates
in order to compare pollen and seeds migration rates across four estuaries we estimated fst and fis from microsatellite data and gst from cpdna data using spagedi  <dig> 
 <cit> . these f-estimates were used to calculate the ratio  of pollen migration  to seed migration   for each mangrove species following the equation r =  − 2/ . in addition, the same f-statistics based on microsatellite and cpdna variations were used to test the null hypothesis mseed = mpollen comparing the expected maternal fst predicted from microsatellite variation  vs. the observed maternal fst estimated as gst from actual cpdna variation
 <cit> . the expected maternal fst was calculated following fst mat = /amat + fst bipar where amat =  <dig>  and abipar change depending of outcrossing rate  calculated for each species from microsatellite data . under this procedure, the null hypothesis is rejected if confidence intervals  of observed and expected values fail to overlap
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although there is documented direct and genetic evidence for extreme ldd in mangrove species a. germinans and r. mangle, our data across estuaries in panama showed restricted gene dispersal overall and equivalent rates of seed and pollen dispersal in both mangrove species. rhizophora mangle showed lower gene diversity and lower genetic structure than a. germinans. this suggest that an amphophilous pollen syndrome combined with a higher propagule longevity leads to a greater chance of successful establishing at long distances, increasing gene flow and decreasing gene diversity and population structure. however, species density, coastal geomorphology as well as ocean currents could vary across ocean basins and estuaries, generating a variety of situations on local scales that complicate any prediction in terms of expected levels of genetic structure.
