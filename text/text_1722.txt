BACKGROUND
microorganisms used in various types of biotechnical processes encounter constantly changing environmental conditions, to which they adapt by changing their cellular physiology. the performance of the microorganism has a major impact on the performance of the process and as a consequence, bioprocess monitoring and control strategies based on the physiological status of the culture have become more popular  <cit> . in bioprocesses the physiological status of the culture is generally measured indirectly by analysis of extracellular variables such as enzyme activities, ph and exhaust gas concentrations. recent developments in analytical methods allow direct evaluation of cellular physiology by analysis of intracellular variables such as proteins, rnas or metabolites, either in focused or systems-wide manner  <cit> .

by combination of transcriptomic, proteomic and/or metabolic profiles with advanced bioinformatic analysis it is possible to predict from the massive amount of data biologically meaningful analytes, i.e. biomarkers which can predict certain physiological events. in biotechnical processes such biomarkers have been used e.g. for detection of osmotic and oxidative stress conditions or trace element deficiencies in yeasts  <cit>  and bacteria  <cit> . simple and robust assays are required in order to use these biomarkers in monitoring or control of bioprocesses. transcriptional analysis of selected marker genes provides one potential way for robust monitoring of physiological events, since adaptation to changes in the environment takes place rapidly at the level of gene expression  <cit> . in addition it is possible to measure multiple targets in a single assay with rna which is more difficult to achieve with enzymes or metabolites.

few microarray studies have been performed specifically to identify gene markers to be used in monitoring of industrial fermentations  <cit> . conventional northern blot analysis is still abundantly used for the actual monitoring of the selected markers in process conditions  <cit> . new tools for more robust rna analysis are emerging, such as quantitative rt-pcr  <cit> , and combination of sandwich hybridisation with fluorescent  <cit>  or electric detection  <cit> . depending on the organism and length of the process these methods may be feasible for at-line mrna expression monitoring, but would generally be applicable for only a limited number of targets and/or samples.

we have recently developed a method for transcriptional analysis method called trac   <cit> . the trac method is suitable for rapid simultaneous analysis of  <dig> samples with multiplex target detection, allowing high-throughput, focused expression analysis  <cit>  or alternatively it can be performed with amplifiable dna probes and pcr  <cit>  to reach high sensitivity. trac has been applied for gene expression analysis of microbial cultures  <cit> , multiplex quantification of bacterial populations  <cit>  and to monitor gene expression stability in continuous cultures  <cit> . in this study we have used trac for expression monitoring of more than  <dig> marker genes in different types of protein production processes performed with the industrially important filamentous fungus trichoderma reesei. expression levels of the marker genes, which are involved in different process relevant pathways, were compared with extracellular process parameters from the cultures, such as specific growth rates, production rates of secreted enzymes and availability of nutrients and oxygen. identification of relationships between gene expression fingerprints and process performance would offer possibilities for process optimisation and control.

RESULTS
polya rna- and biomass-based normalisation of gene expression data
expression of a set of  <dig> marker genes, representing various physiological states, was monitored in different phases of two batch and fed-batch cultures and one continuous culture of an m. albomyces laccase producing strain of the filamentous fungus trichoderma reesei. potentially useful molecular marker genes were selected on the basis of their responses in conditions of interest as reported in publicly available transcriptional analysis data for various species of filamentous fungi or saccharomyces cerevisiae. the genes used in this study are listed in table  <dig> with references to available data on these genes or corresponding homologues in other organisms.

the trac expression analysis for the selected genes was performed directly from cell lysates, and the gene expression levels were related to the amount of biomass used in the hybridisation or to overall polya rna concentration of the lysate . the ratio of marker gene mrna to total polya rna shows the change in the expression of a specific gene relative to overall gene expression, whereas the ratio of marker gene mrna to biomass shows the changing level of a transcript relative to the overall culture .

polya rna concentration in the lysed biomass in different growth phases of the two batch cultures, which differed considerably in growth and substrate consumption rate are presented in figure  <dig>  in batch i the polya rna concentration varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  mg g- <dig> dry weight  for the first  <dig> h, while μ was above  <dig>  h- <dig> and lactose concentration above  <dig> g l- <dig>  after  <dig> h, when the culture conditions had become growth limiting, the polya rna content relative to biomass decreased to approx.  <dig>  mg g- <dig> dry weight. however in batch culture ii the specific growth rate and uptake of lactose were slower than in batch i after  <dig> h and the polya rna per g biomass decreased at this time already, although the polya rna content in the biomass subsequently increased between  <dig> and  <dig> h. after  <dig> h the cultures were similar. to verify that the decrease in the polya rna content after  <dig> h was not a result of experimental error , total rna was extracted from the samples of batch culture ii and the polya rna to total rna ratio was determined. this confirmed that a decrease in overall gene expression had occurred after  <dig> h .

the specific growth rates  were compared to the expression of two ribosomal protein mrnas  as growth-related marker genes in these batch cultures. the changes in the transcription of these genes relative to biomass were similar to μ . the relatively low specific growth rate between  <dig> and  <dig> h for batch ii , corresponded to a  <dig> -fold lower expression of the two ribosomal mrnas during this period. however, in both fermentations, an approximately 2-fold increase in the ribosomal protein mrna to biomass ratio was observed  <dig> to  <dig> h before the decrease in specific growth rate which occurred after all lactose had been consumed.

monitoring carbohydrate metabolism markers
a number of genes coding for enzymes involved in central carbohydrate metabolism  are known to be transcriptionally regulated according to the availability of glucose in t. reesei  <cit> . we measured the relative expression of three of these genes involved in central carbohydrate metabolism in batch and fed-batch fermentations with lactose as carbon source . lack of glucose has been shown to have an increasing , decreasing  or indifferent effect  on their expression  <cit> . both gpd <dig> and acs <dig> increased from  <dig> to  <dig> h in lactose-rich conditions  in batch cultures . after the lactose concentration decreased below  <dig> to  <dig> g l- <dig>  the abundance of gpd <dig> mrna relative to polya rna decreased  <dig> – 65% compared to its maximal expression around  <dig> h, whereas acs <dig> mrna continued to increase at low lactose concentration  and during starvation. about  <dig> h after complete exhaustion of lactose, acs <dig> was expressed at a  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold higher level than in high lactose concentrations. the eno <dig> mrna to polya rna ratio was constant when lactose concentration was above  <dig> g l- <dig>  whereas during starvation eno <dig> mrna was undetectable.

in the fed-batch fermentations a  <dig> to  <dig> -fold increase of acs <dig> mrna level occurred when lactose concentration decreased from  <dig> to below  <dig> g l- <dig>  before the start of the lactose feed  as in the deceleration to stationary phases of the batch cultures. lactose was fed to the fermentor after  <dig> h at a rate that maintained the rate of base  consumption at around  <dig> – <dig>  ml l- <dig> min <dig>  as long as the feed rate of lactose was below  <dig> mg h- <dig> g- <dig> dw, acs <dig> mrna level continued to increase, but it decreased rapidly after the feed rate increased above this value , even though the residual lactose concentration in the medium remained zero. termination of the lactose feed caused another increase in acs <dig> expression. gpd <dig> and eno <dig> mrna levels showed only minor changes during the different phases of the fed-batch cultures, and eno <dig> was again undetectable under starvation conditions.

monitoring marker genes responding to oxygen
expression of the heat shock protein gene hsp <dig> and the heme biosynthesis gene hem <dig> has been shown to be regulated by oxygen availability in t. reesei  <cit> . the trx <dig> gene encoding thioredoxin was chosen as a potential marker for oxidative stress based on s. cereviciae transcriptional data  <cit> . in batch cultures  and in the batch phase of fed-batch cultures the expression of these three genes increased  <dig>  to 2-fold between  <dig> to  <dig> h, while the biomass increased from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> g l- <dig> and po <dig> decreased from  <dig> to  <dig> %. a 20–35% decrease in the expression level relative to polya rna was observed for these  <dig> genes after the maximal expression was measured .

the maximal expression levels of these genes in batch cultures were compared to the corresponding levels measured in steady state of chemostat cultures with high and low cell density, and in anaerobic conditions  as well as in shake flask precultures . in anaerobic conditions the expression levels of hsp <dig> and hem <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  -fold higher than the maximal expression levels measured in batch or fed-batch cultures. comparable hsp <dig> and hem <dig> expression levels were measured between high cell density  batch or fed-batch cultures and chemostat cultures with 30% po <dig>  whereas at low cell density  the expression level of hsp <dig> was  <dig> -fold lower and that of hem <dig> was appr. 2-fold lower than in the high cell density aerated cultures. in the shake flask cultures  hem <dig> expression levels were comparable to those observed in high density cultures, whereas the hsp <dig> transcript level was 2-fold lower. this indicates that other stress factors besides oxygen limitation resulted in up-regulation of the hsp <dig> mrna level in the high density cultures. trx <dig> expression was similar in all aerobic bioreactor cultures, but was on average  <dig> -fold higher in aerobic than in anaerobic or shake flask culture conditions.

comparison of secreted enzyme production rate and mrna expression
the transformant strain llk13/ <dig> used in these studies produced m. albomyces laccase under the cellobiohydrolase  promoter, as well as all the native cellulases, including cellobiohydrolase i . cbh <dig> promoter is induced by cellulose and by oligosaccharides and disaccharides derived from cellulose, such as cellubiose or sophorose. also several other disaccharides such as lactose induce cbh <dig> expression  <cit> . transcript levels of the genes  expressing these secreted enzymes and two folding factors  were monitored during batch and fed-batch cultures and were compared with specific extracellular production rates of laccase and cbhi . both biomass  and polya rna  concentrations were used to normalise gene expression so that lac <dig> and cbh <dig> could be readily compared with biomass specific production rates and to allow physiological interpretation of the data.

expression of cbh <dig>  lac <dig>  pdi <dig>  and bip <dig> increased during the first  <dig> h of growth in batch cultures. in the fed-batch culture there was a  <dig>  and  <dig>  -fold increase in mrnas for lac <dig> and cbh <dig> respectively, after the lactose feeding was started, whereas their expression decreased in the batch cultures. there were corresponding increase in the specific extracellular production rates of laccase  and cbhi , after starting of the lactose feed in the fed-batch culture. the highest amounts of lac <dig>  cbh <dig>  pdi <dig> and bip <dig> mrnas were measured between  <dig> and  <dig> h after the start of the lactose feed.  <dig> h after the lactose feed had been started both the gene expression  and the specific enzymes production rates  had decreased to levels similar to those observed during the batch phase.

to study the variation between the biomass and polya mrna based normalisation they were compared in the normalisation of the major cellulase cbh <dig> expression in the fed-batch culture . an expected difference between the profiles of cbh <dig> to biomass and cbh <dig> to polya rna ratios was observed at the end of the culture. cbh <dig> to biomass ratio showed a faster decreasing trend after about  <dig> h than cbh <dig> expression relative to polya rna, since increasing proportion of the biomass became metabolically inactive and polya was produced only by the metabolically active part of the culture. it should be noted, however, that e.g. increase in a gene mrna to polya rna ratio is not necessarily a sign of specific up-regulation, but can also indicate slower down-regulation than for the majority of genes. however increase or decrease in this ratio indicates the growing or decreasing physiological importance of the gene product in the particular conditions.

the specific production rate of both cbhi and laccase followed trends similar to the cbh <dig> and lac <dig> gene expression profiles, although a delay was observed between the gene expression and the corresponding extracellular enzyme production rate. for example the specific extracellular laccase production rate, which was more frequently measured than cbhi, was highest  <dig> to  <dig> h after the highest gene expression level was measured. an increase in laccase production rate was consistently observed at the end of the fed-batch cultures after lactose feed was stopped . this was not observed for cbhi.

monitoring responses caused by starvation
the highest expression levels for genes coding the cellulases, laccase and folding factors were detected at growth rate  <dig>  –  <dig>  h- <dig>  at low lactose concentration in batch and lactose limiting in fed-batch cultures . to determine the responses of the marker genes during the transition from deceleration to stationary phase, samples were taken frequently around the time when lactose was expected to be exhausted in batch cultures . gene expression levels are presented relative to overall gene expression , because the responses of metabolically active cells during starvation was of interest.

the time when the base consumption rate had decreased to zero and the lactose was undetectable was considered to be the time at which starvation began. the expression of genes coding for carbohydrate degrading enzymes was at this time on average  <dig>  -fold lower than the maximal expression level measured during these cultures. the time of maximal expression of cbh <dig>  lac <dig>  egl <dig>  and bgl <dig>  was  <dig>  to  <dig>  hours prior to the start of starvation, when μ was  <dig>  –  <dig>  h- <dig>  the rate of base consumption was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol min- <dig> g- <dig> dw and the lactose concentration was below  <dig> g l- <dig>  along with cellulases and laccases the majority of the genes analysed showed down-regulation during starvation, including the folding factors , oxidative stress genes  and glycolysis genes  .

however, six to eight marker genes out of the  <dig>  in addition to acs <dig> , showed more than  <dig> -fold increased mrna levels during starvation . the trend of increasing expression of these genes started  <dig>  to  <dig> hours before base consumption stopped. these genes coded for heat shock proteins hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  metacaspase  involved in apoptosis, neutral trehalase , membrane fusion factor , copper transporter  and two conidiation related proteins .

monitoring of a continuous culture
continuous culture was used to study further the effect of growth conditions on the productivity of extracellular proteins and to optimise their production. different growth conditions were applied during the culture, i.e. altering the medium feed rate and composition and process temperature. in addition, unexpected disturbances occurred during the process, which was maintained for  <dig> h. the trac assay was used to monitor expression  <dig> genes in a single pool, including markers that showed predictive value for cellulase productivity , specific growth rate , and starvation  . a more detailed description of the process parameters in the continuous culture will be published elsewhere .

the feed rate of the culture was controlled by the rate of base consumption . the medium feed to the fermentor started at  <dig> h  when the rate of base consumption decreased below the deltabas criterion value  l- <dig> min-1). this criterion kept the dilution rate  at approximately  <dig>  h- <dig> and the specific base consumption rate, rbase, was  <dig>  μmol min- <dig> g- <dig> dw. the criterion for base consumption was decreased in two steps: at  <dig> h by 25%  and at  <dig> h by additional 20% . the average rbase value decreased to  <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol min- <dig> g- <dig> dry weight as a result of these two changes and the average dilution rate decreased to  <dig>  and  <dig>  h- <dig>  the cbh <dig> mrna level increased  <dig> -fold  and the specific extracellular protein production rate  increased  <dig>  –  <dig>  -fold  after the first step . after the second reduction in base consumption rate  there was no immediate effect on cbh <dig> mrna or extracellular protein production rate, but after 48– <dig> h  these values decreased to the level measured prior to the changes in the base consumption rate .

at  <dig> h the organic nitrogen concentration was halved in the medium , which decreased d to an average value of  <dig>  while the rbase increased to an average level of  <dig>  μmol min- <dig> g- <dig> dw. the lower level of nitrogen in the medium will have been partly compensated for by the increased base  consumption. the specific production rate of extracellular proteins was unaffected by this change and the only marker gene which responded to the lowered n concentration was the amino acid permease gap <dig>  the mrna level of which was increased  <dig> -fold  <dig> h after change in the medium .

the expression profile of the ribosomal protein mrna  followed the changes in the dilution  rate throughout the culture, consistent with earlier observations from batch cultures . the gene coding for acetyl-coa-synthase , which showed its highest expression at a low lactose concentration , was somewhat induced when the dilution rate was reduced . two other genes  showing increased mrna level under starvation conditions  were also transitorily induced after  <dig> h when the rate of medium feed decreased .

finally at  <dig> h the temperature of the culture was reduced from  <dig> to  <dig> °c over a  <dig> h period . a number of marker genes responded by increasing their expression levels. some of these genes  returned to the expression levels measured before the temperature change in less than  <dig> h, whereas others  remained at the higher expression level, even after the temperature was increased to 28°c again for the remainder of the culture. however, it can not be concluded that these responses were specifically related to the temperature change, since a temporary increase in the dilution rate occurred simultaneously because of a process control problem when growth and base consumption were reduced at the lower temperature .

two technical disturbances occurred during the process. the first occurred at  <dig> h when the vessel weight controller malfunctioned and the culture volume decreased to about  <dig> litres. the volume was increased to  <dig> l by medium addition, which caused increased expression of e.g. cbh <dig> and ribosomal protein mrna  genes. both reached stable expression levels within 70– <dig> hours  of the disturbance . at  <dig> h, oscillation in the feed control mechanism was observed. samples were collected at  <dig> h interval after this disturbance and temporarily increased expression in many of the marker genes  was observed .

discussion
in this work we monitored the expression of  <dig> marker genes during changing conditions in batch, fed-batch and continuous fermentations of the filamentous fungus t. reesei using the transcriptional analysis method trac. in production processes the environmental conditions in the fermentor may be variable, causing corresponding variability in physiological parameters. this makes conventional gene expression data normalisation methods, such as the use of house-keeping genes, unreliable. in this study we related the expression of specific genes either to the amount of biomass or to the total polya rna content used in the hybridisation. relating marker gene expression to biomass can be more useful in prediction of culture performance parameters such as specific growth and production rates, whereas normalisation to polya rna predicts the physiological responses in metabolically active cells more accurately.

both polya rna to biomass and polya rna to total rna ratios were shown to be growth phase dependent, and batch-to-batch variation in growth and protein production was also evident at the level of overall mrna expression . quantitative determination of total rna per g biomass from mycelial biomass is not reliable, however comparing the polya rna per g biomass with polya rna per total rna from the same culture  indicated that the total rna to biomass ratio was not constant in changing environmental conditions of the batch cultures. it is thus beneficial to use a quantitatively measured factor to normalise expression levels between samples collected from different phases of a cultivation, rather than basing the normalisation on the assumption that a chosen factor is constant.

the normalisation based on polya rna is similar to the use of the expression levels of all genes for a normalisation in microarray experiments. however, for normalisation of genome-wide transcription data the distributions of the expression signal intensities between samples are equalised, i.e. it is assumed that global shifts in the mrna population do not occur. this is a reasonable assumption e.g. in steady state conditions that can be achieved in continuous cultures, however disregarding global changes in mrna levels during non-steady conditions  can result in the masking of true gene expression differences between compared samples  <cit> . on the other hand, variability in oligo dt-based mrna capture can be caused by decreasing polya tail length, that has been observed in stationary phase yeast cells  <cit> . however, since deadenylation leads to degradation of the mrna body  <cit> , and the polya tail is required for translation initiation  <cit> , the physiological relevance of mrna species with short or no polya tail is presumably insignificant, when the mrna synthesis rate is low.

expression of the native cellulase gene cbh <dig> and the recombinant laccase gene lac <dig> showed correlation with the specific extracellular production rates of the corresponding enzymes. there was a delay of  <dig> to  <dig> h between increased level of lac <dig> transcripts and laccase production . m. albomyces laccase is processed at its c-terminus and is presumably activated by the processing  <cit> , and a delay in this processing might contribute to the difference between the lac <dig> expression and laccase production profiles. c-terminal processing of laccase could also explain the strong increase of its activity in the fed-batch cultures after termination of the substrate feed, which was not observed for cbhi . gene expression of the secreted enzymes was highest when the growth rate was decreasing from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h- <dig> in batch and fed-batch cultures  or was constant between  <dig>  and  <dig>  h- <dig> in the continuous culture . this is in accordance with the optimal growth rate  for production of extracellular proteins observed in chemostat cultures of t.reesei  <cit> . when the growth rate was below  <dig>  h- <dig> decreased gene expression of cellulases and recombinant laccase was observed in addition to the responses associated with starvation . this data indicates that the "physiological window" in which the productivity of these extracellular proteins is optimal is narrow. in general the relation between specific product formation rate of a secreted protein and specific growth rate seems to be more dependent on the protein and its transcriptional promoter than on the organism. the specific product formation rate of a secreted protein can increase consistently with increasing growth rate, as shown e.g. for fab fragment production in pichia pastoris  <cit>  and β-galactosidase production in escherichia coli  <cit> . whereas for other secreted proteins, such as α-galactosidase of p. pastoris, the specific product formation rate is at highest at low growth rates  <cit> .

the deltabas feed control system, uses the rate of base consumption to try to maintain a culture in the optimal production phase by limiting the growth of the culture but avoiding total carbon source depletion  <cit> . during the optimal production phase the base  was consumed at a rate of  <dig>  –  <dig>  μmol min- <dig> g- <dig> dw . however, in the fed-batch and continuous cultures in which this feeding strategy was applied, the optimal production was maintained for rather short periods of time. in the continuous culture most of the time the growth  rates were either too high or too low . during the feeding phase in the fed-batch cultures the growth rate was mainly below  <dig>  h- <dig> , being too low for optimal production. induced expression level of some of the starvation markers during the lactose  or medium feed  further indicated that too little substrate was available for the culture at this low dilution rate. however, at the end of the fed-batch cultures it was observed that the metabolically active part of the culture was still expressing cellulase genes  at a relatively high level, suggesting that improved productivity would be attained if culture viability could be maintained for a longer time.

altogether  <dig> out of  <dig> marker genes  were observed to have more than 2-fold increased mrna level under starvation and slow growth conditions, indicating their increasing importance under these conditions. of the induced genes, nth <dig> codes for neutral trehalase, which is involved in degradation of storage carbohydrates  <cit> . ctaa codes for a copper transporter  <cit> . and in these fermentations the copper requirement may have been increased because of production of the copper-containing laccase  <cit> . the cysteine protease encoded by mca <dig>  <cit>  is presumably involved in programmed cell death. in yeast the corresponding mca1p is under post-translational regulation  <cit> , but in t. reesei it would appear also to be subjected to transcriptional regulation. in neurospora crassa the expression of the clock controlled gene ccg <dig> has been shown to be induced during glucose deprivation  <cit> . the increased level of con <dig> mrna may be a response to nitrogen starvation, as shown by bailey-shrode and ebbole  <cit> . high gene expression of hsp <dig> s. cerevisiae homologue  has been observed in late stationary phase yeast cells  <cit>  and hsp <dig> is homologous to the mammalian glucose-regulated protein grp <dig>  for which up-regulation has been shown when cellular upd-glucose is reduced  <cit> . s. cerevisiae sec <dig>  is involved in starvation-induced degradation of tryptophan permease in yeast  <cit> . the acs <dig> gene has been shown to be strongly induced in glucose starvation in t. reesei  <cit> . the induction of these genes elucidates some of the physiological events during starvation and slow growth: mobilisation of storage carbohydrates, acquisition of nutrients from the medium, stress responses, onset of conidia formation and triggering of apoptosis. the consistent induction of these genes preceding the complete exhaustion of the carbon source can make them useful markers in optimisation of substrate feeding strategies, when their expression is monitored continuously.

the heme biosynthesis gene hem <dig> of s. cerevisiae has been shown to be induced under anaerobic conditions  <cit>  and the ssa type hsp <dig> proteins have been shown to be part of a complex that regulates transcription of aerobic genes  <cit> . the homologues of these genes are induced by anaerobic conditions in t. reesei . based on the expression of these genes during the batch, fed-batch and continuous processes, 30% dissolved oxygen  concentration even at relatively high cell density  is apparently sufficient to maintain aerobic culture conditions, although at lower density  and higher do  the expression of these genes was more than 2-fold lower. strong induction of these anaerobic marker genes and decreased levels of the cellulase gene mrnas were observed only when do was lower than 10% . in large scale industrial fermentations with thick filamentous slurry, inhomogeneity of the system can cause local limitations in oxygen supply  <cit> . thus monitoring of the expression of these markers in such fermentations could be useful in devising intervention strategies which would maintain better aeration and productivity. simultaneously with the increase in hsp <dig> and hem <dig> expression, moderately increased expression of the thioredoxin gene  was observed , which indicated a response to accumulation of reactive oxygen species presumably because of culture ageing  <cit> .

the trac method was shown to be an efficient tool for monitoring sets of marker genes in different bioprocess conditions. the possibility to analyse simultaneously in 96-well format large number of samples, allows frequent sampling during the cultivations. crude lysed cell material can be directly used in the hybridisations, thus rna extraction and cdna conversions are avoided. detection of multiple mrna targets from a single sample and low hands-on time of the protocol makes the assay cost-effective. for off-line monitoring, the advantages of the system are most clearly demonstrated in the analysis of the continuous culture. the protocol starting from the lysis of all the  <dig> mycelial samples to analysis of expression of  <dig> genes in duplicate  was carried out in  <dig> h with  <dig> to  <dig> h hands-on time. for at line monitoring  the entire protocol  can be carried out in approximately  <dig> h. increasing the degree of automation by combining some or all of the  <dig> steps  would make the overall protocol time even shorter and frequent at-line monitoring more practical. such an analysis system would have a wide application potential.

we have demonstrated here that by marker genes analysis it is possible to evaluate various physiological factors of the culture, such as nutrient and oxygen limitation, growth and extracellular protein production rates in the changing environmental conditions. transcriptional analysis can provide a more complete picture of the physiological state of an organism than can be achieved by the external parameters that are measured from production processes. in addition to increasing the knowledge of gene regulation, gene expression data collected at high frequency may suggest strategies for optimising process parameters, such as medium composition and feeding strategy. accumulation of microarray data from t. reesei and other industrially relevant microorganisms grown under various conditions will further help in the selection process of marker genes, the expression of which has a predictive value in the evaluation of the physiological state and performance of the cultures.

CONCLUSIONS
we have monitored by the trac method the expression of a set of  <dig> marker genes, involved in different process relevant pathways, in batch, fed-batch cultures and continuous cultures of a filamentous fungus t. reesei transformant strain producing m. albomyces laccase. many of the marker gene expression levels measured at frequent intervals showed to have value in prediction of consecutive physiological effects and process performance. mrna levels of genes coding for industrially relevant secreted cellulases and recombinant laccase followed the trends in the corresponding extracellular enzyme production rates and was at highest in narrow specific growth rate range of  <dig>  –  <dig>  h- <dig>  the specific growth rate of the fungal cultures was possible to evaluate on the basis of ribosomal protein mrna expression. increasing expression of altogether nine starvation related genes preceded the complete exhaustion of carbon source at least by some hours, indicating their usefulness in prediction of insufficient substrate feed for optimal production. deficiency in oxygen supply was manifested by increased level of two oxygen sensitive genes hem <dig> and hsp <dig>  the trac method was shown to be an effective tool in focused transcriptional monitoring of biotechnical processes and the data produced by this method supported the usefulness of intensive gene expression analysis for process optimisation work.
