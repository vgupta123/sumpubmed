BACKGROUND
many factors contribute to genome organization, but one feature seen broadly across eukaryotes is that genes with similar patterns of expression often are physically clustered  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae genome is enriched for pairs and triplets of coexpressed genes, which also often have shared function  <cit> . essential genes also form clusters in yeast, independently of coexpression clustering  <cit> . the ordering of coexpressed genes and essential genes in yeast is conserved over large evolutionary distances  <cit> . arabidopsis thaliana also shows evidence of clustering by expression and by function  <cit> , but unlike in yeast, arabidopsis clusters can be quite large, including up to  <dig> genes  <cit> , and up to 10% of arabidopsis genes belong to such clusters  <cit> . the nematode c. elegans has small coexpression clusters of 2– <dig> genes  <cit>  that are not attributable to operons  <cit> . unlike other eukaryotes studied, tandem duplicates are heavily represented in c. elegans expression clusters  <cit> .

initial analyses in drosophila described clusters of three or more tissue-specific genes, particularly for testis  <cit> , and large domains of 10– <dig> coordinately expressed genes  <cit> . subsequent statistical analyses indicate that the large domains are actually artifactual aggregates of smaller coexpression clusters, comprised of housekeeping genes and functionally coordinated genes  <cit> , and experiments measuring the effect of chromosomal rearrangements that disrupt the large domains did not support the idea that they are important for controlling gene expression  <cit> . evidence for conservation of expression clusters across drosophila species is mixed. genes within syntenic blocks are more likely to have correlated expression than expected by chance  <cit> , and some regions show evidence of coevolution of expression  <cit> . however, other studies associate short intergenic distance and coexpression with higher rates of genomic rearrangement  <cit> .

in mammals, housekeeping genes form clusters  <cit> , as do low-expression genes that are inactive in most tissues  <cit> . there is evidence of clustering of testis-specific genes in mouse  <cit> . in contrast to yeast, there is little evidence for clustering based on gene function in mammals  <cit> . a screen for mouse essential genes showed that they are enriched in certain chromosomal regions  <cit> , although it is unclear if the genes in these clusters are coordinately expressed. vertebrate coexpression clusters are thought to arise gradually over evolutionary time, and some are conserved between human and chicken  <cit> , and human and mouse  <cit> . clusters that include highly expressed genes are not more likely to be conserved than expected by chance  <cit> , and linkage between highly expressed genes may in fact be deleterious  <cit> .

functionally coordinated gene clusters, which often overlap with coexpression clusters, are not conserved across eukaryotes, and the genes and functions that cluster differ widely across the species studied  <cit> .

the appreciation that genome location affects expression dates back to observations of differential expression of transgene insertions  <cit> , but the mechanisms that maintain coexpression clusters remain unknown. proposed mechanisms include lcr-mediated activity such as in the β-globin locus  <cit> , sharing of proximal regulatory features  <cit> , or regional enhancers  <cit> . analyses in several species have shown that adjacent coexpressed genes tend to be physically closer than the average  <cit> , but it is not known if this is required for coexpression. insulator proteins are thought to help separate genomic regions into domains of activity or inactivity governed by long-range regulatory elements that affect many genes  <cit> . the insulator protein ctcf has been implicated in the creation and maintenance of chromatin loop domains  <cit> . other experiments associate localization to the nuclear pore with increased expression  <cit> , or proximity to the nuclear lamina with repression of transcription  <cit> . recent advances in chromatin conformation capture and other methods for interrogating the three-dimensional structure of the nucleus allow characterization of physical contacts between genomic regions  <cit> . these studies provide evidence for interactions among neighboring genes, which may be related to gene coexpression.

here we describe a novel method for identifying coexpression clusters and apply it to drosophila expression data from a diverse set of tissues. in contrast to previous studies, we use an explicit probability model for segment-dependent gene expression that allows us to find a best-fitting partition of the genome into contiguous segments of coordinately expressed genes. our approach avoids prior assumptions about segment size, the magnitude of coexpression effects, or other heuristics, and is based on parameters with natural mechanistic interpretations. we identify widespread small clusters of coexpressed genes and explore their properties. in particular we provide evidence for an association with physical interaction domains   <cit>  and insulator binding sites.

RESULTS
expression model
previous work using correlation-based methods to identify clusters of coordinately expressed genes has had mixed success  <cit> . correlation-based results are strongly affected by the choice of arbitrary cutoffs that may over- or under-estimate coexpression and may lead to artifactual clustering  <cit> . we instead use an approach that is based on an explicit probability model for the observed expression data. the model assumes that the genome can be partitioned into contiguous groups of genes  such that the genes within a segment tend to have similar expression levels across tissues. specifically, the  expression value for a gene in a given segment is assumed to be the sum of a segment effect, which represents a regional effect on expression in a given tissue that influences all genes in the segment equally and represents shared regulation, and a gene-specific deviation, which reflects private regulation and ‘noise’ . a segment may consist of one or many genes. we performed our analyses using microarray data, taking the steady-state mrna abundance measured by these arrays as a proxy for transcriptional activity, however our method is easily adaptable to data from other technologies. model details, our procedure for finding an optimal segmentation of the genome, and analyses confirming that our approach recovers the correct segmentation from simulated data are described in methods.

properties of drosophila expression segments
we analyzed expression data from drosophila melanogaster generated by the flyatlas project  <cit> . the flyatlas dataset samples  <dig> diverse tissues, of which we analyzed  <dig> after quality filtering, and  <dig> genes. optimal segmentation identification is reasonably robust , and we chose the best scoring segmentation for followup analysis. roughly two thirds of genes fall into multigene segments and thus appear to have coordinated expression with their neighbors across tissues . multigenic segments have a mean of  <dig>  genes  . to examine across-tissue expression patterns, we plotted the across-tissue means and standard deviations of segments with three or more genes. these segments cluster into two classes: one having low mean and high standard deviation , and the other having low standard deviation  . the  <dig> segments in the top quartile for standard deviation value tend to have highly tissue-restricted expression patterns, with mean expression that exceeds the dataset median in only a small number of tissues. for  <dig> of these, expression is restricted in this sense to a single tissue, and for  <dig> of the  <dig>  the tissue is testis. this supports previous studies in drosophila and mouse showing that testis-expressed genes often form coexpression clusters  <cit> . in contrast, segments expressed in non-testis tissues are often expressed in at least one other tissue .

to identify segments with shared function as well as coexpression, we tested each segment for significant enrichment of go slim categories associated to its genes. enriched segments are uncommon but more frequent than expected by chance  with  <dig> of  <dig> multigenic segments having a significantly enriched term  .

we then looked for features that may illuminate mechanisms for the formation and maintenance of coexpression segments. intergenic regions between segments are longer than intergenic regions within segments  . this length difference is consistent with previous work on coexpressed genes in drosophila and other organisms  <cit> . we verified that it is independent of repeats in the intergenic regions . this suggests that  the mechanisms involved in establishing or maintaining coexpression may be less effective over longer distances.

we analyzed gene orientation for adjacent pairs of genes and found that two-gene segments are enriched for “head-to-head” gene pairs, which may be regulated by a bidirectional promoter  <cit> , relative to pairs flanking intersegment regions  or adjacent pairs within longer  segments .  <dig> %  of all two-gene segments have head-to-head orientation, and  <dig> %  of all head-to-head pairs lie within a segment, indicating that while head-to-head orientation may facilitate coexpression, it is neither required nor diagnostic .

physical interaction domains  <cit>  represent an intriguing candidate mechanism for coexpression regulation. we find a highly significant sharing  of segment and interaction domain endpoints, with  <dig> %  of interaction domain endpoints also being segment endpoints. however, segments are much smaller than interaction domains  and only  <dig> interaction domains consist of a single segment .

insulators may play a role in establishing interaction domain boundaries  <cit> . however, many insulator binding sites do not lie at interaction domain boundaries. we investigated the possibility that insulators may play a broader role in defining segments, using insulator chip-seq peak data generated by nègre et al. <cit> . we first confirmed that  peaks for beaf- <dig>  cp <dig>  ctcf, gaf, and mod are significantly enriched  in intersegment regions that do include a physical interaction domain boundary , and that this enrichment disappears after masking those peaks that overlap the 2 kb windows centered on interaction domain boundaries as identified by sexton et al. . we then investigated intersegment regions that do not contain an interaction domain boundary. in the set of all such regions, we see no significant enrichment for insulator peaks. however, if we restrict to intersegment regions adjacent to long  segments, we find that the insulators beaf- <dig>  cp <dig>  ctcf, and su are significantly enriched by factors of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively  , as compared to the rest of the genome . thus it appears that insulators may play a role in defining coexpression segments, beyond their association with physical interaction domains. we also looked for insulator enrichment in intersegment regions adjacent to highly tissue-restricted segments, and found that only su is significantly enriched ), consistent with previous findings that su binds in regions where transcription is repressed in most tissues  <cit> .

finally, we used logistic regression to investigate whether the association between interaction domain and expression segment boundaries is entirely mediated by known insulators. using a model with interaction domain boundary presence/absence  as the dependent variable, and insulator peak counts of various types, region length, and presence/absence of an expression segment boundary as predictors, we find that segment boundaries have significant power to predict physical domain boundaries beyond what can be explained by insulator peak data and region length . this suggests that unknown additional factors are involved in defining both expression segment and interaction domain boundaries.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a novel method, based on an explicit probability model, for identifying coexpression clusters that in contrast to previous approaches does not rely on arbitrary cutoffs or heuristics. we find that two thirds of drosophila genes fall into multigene coexpression segments, that these segments are of two broad types, housekeeping and tissue restricted, and that clustering of genes expressed in a single tissue is largely confined to testis genes.

adjacent genes within segments are physically closer to one another than adjacent genes in different segments. our segmentation pattern is correlated with physical interaction domains  <cit>  and with insulator binding, suggesting that coexpression segments may represent substructure within the interaction domains, and that they may be in part determined by insulator binding. since coexpression segments are determined from expression data across diverse tissues, their association with physical interaction domains suggests that aspects of the domain structure may be shared between tissues. although our analyses were confined to drosophila, the observation that coexpression clusters across many eukaryotes tend to have similar properties  <cit>  suggests that an association with insulator binding and physical interaction domains may hold more broadly.
