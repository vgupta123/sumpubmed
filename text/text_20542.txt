BACKGROUND
superoxide dismutase enzymes  are a family of metalloenzymes that converts the superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide and water. two copper/zinc-containing isoforms of sod exists in mammals including cu/zn-sod  located in intracellular compartments  <cit>  and extracellular sod  found predominantly in the extracellular matrix of tissues  <cit> . cu/zn-sod is a  <dig> kda homo-dimer  <cit> , whereas ec-sod is a  <dig> kda tetrameric glycoprotein with regional amino acid sequence homology to cu/zn-sod  <cit> . the n-terminal region of ec-sod is involved in hydrophobic inter-subunit interactions stabilizing the ec-sod tetramer  <cit> . the importance of these interactions has been emphasized by the finding that the dimeric rat ec-sod  <cit> , is converted to a tetramer by substituting a hydrophilic residue  within the n-terminal region for a hydrophobic one   <cit> . in addition, the reverse substitution converted tetrameric mouse ec-sod into a dimer. the c-terminal region of ec-sod contains a cluster of basic amino acid residues  <cit>  with affinity for heparin/heparan sulfate  <cit>  and type i collagen  <cit> . we have previously shown, that this region can be proteolytically removed before secretion in a two-step process involving both an endoproteinase and a carboxypeptidase  <cit> . this cleavage event changes the affinity for extracellular matrix  components and affects the biodistribution of the protein. moreover, the cystein residue responsible for an inter-subunit disulfide bridge is present in this region. when mature ec-sod is analyzed under denaturing conditions, cleaved subunits will therefore appear as monomers while intact subunits will be dimers  <cit> .

the overall structure of ec-sod has not been determined. however, we have shown that human ec-sod exists as two different folding variants with distinct disulfide bridge patterns  <cit> . one variant has sod activity  whereas the other form  lacks the capacity to dismutate the superoxide radical. while the disulfide bridge pattern of aec-sod encompass a conserved disulfide bridge found in all cu/zn-containing sods  <cit>  this disulfide bridge is absent in iec-sod. this highly conserved disulfide bridge is essential for maintaining the catalytic activity supporting the absence of enzymatic activity in iec-sod. interestingly, ec-sod from some species including rabbit, mouse, and rat lack a cysteine residue essential for the formation of iec-sod and we have shown that rabbit ec-sod indeed exists only as aec-sod  <cit> . as a consequence of this, the specific activity of rabbit ec- sod was found to be 2-fold higher relative to the human protein  <cit> .

disulfide bridges have generally been categorized as important for structural stability or catalytic activity in, e.g., thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases as thioredoxin and protein disulfide isomerase, where cysteine residues are directly involved in catalysis. however, a third function of disulfide bridges is becoming evident, which involves allosteric regulation of protein activity by reduction and oxidation of disulfide bonds with no catalytic activity  <cit> . it is intriguing to speculate that the presence of two disulfide variants in human ec-sod may represent an example of an allosteric switch.

we have previously discussed the possibility that human ec-sod molecules exist where the ratio of aec-sod and iec-sod subunits within the tetramer varies to produce molecules with different specific activities  <cit> . here we show, that this is indeed the case as the ec-sod dimer can be separated into three distinct pools representing the aa and ii homo-dimers and the ai hetero-dimer. the existence of disulfide dependent folding variants of the same protein has not been observed before and because of the impact on the enzymatic activity it may represent a novel way of regulating the enzymatic activity of ec-sod in vivo.

RESULTS
electrophoretic mobility of the ec-sod dimer
the c-terminally cleaved ec-sod subunit is lacking the inter-chain disulfide bond and is easily separated from the intact disulfide-bonded ec-sod dimer during non-reducing sds-page. we have previously analyzed the c-terminally cleaved ec-sod subunit and shown the two folding variants are resolved when using optimal electrophoretic conditions  <cit>  . however, the disulfide-bonded ec-sod dimer remained poorly resolved and migrated as a broad band . although the n-linked glycan at asn <dig> is homogenous  <cit>  deglycosylation significantly improved the resolution in unreduced sds-page resulting in two closely spaced bands that we denoted α and β, and a slightly slower migrating band called γ . similarly, the folding variants of the deglycosylated c-terminally cleaved ec-sod subunit was better resolved by sds-page. this result shows that the ec-sod dimer exists in three distinct populations which can be separated by sds-page following deglycosylation.

separation of ec-sod dimers by reverse-phase hplc
the c-terminally cleaved ec-sod subunit and disulfide-linked dimer can be separated by reverse-phase hplc  <cit> . moreover, the c-terminally cleaved ec-sod subunit can be further separated into the two different folding variants by reverse-phase hplc following denaturation and s-carboxyamidomethylation  <cit> . to investigate whether the three electrophoretic variants of dimeric ec-sod observed by sds-page could similarly be resolved, we subjected alkylated dimeric ec-sod to reverse-phase analysis using an octyl-derivatized solid support. the material was found to separate into three major peaks without baseline separation  and fractions were collected manually to reduce cross contamination and following subjected to sds-page analysis . this analysis revealed that fraction  <dig> contained components α and β; fraction  <dig> contained components β and γ; and fraction  <dig> was found to contain component γ. based on this pattern of separation, it is likely that baseline separation would have produced three distinct fractions containing isolated components. we conclude that the  <dig> disulfide-bonded ec-sod variants designated α, β and γ can be separated by reverse-phase hplc and that these, based on the difference in electrophoretic mobility, represent folding variants.

analysis of dimeric components by tryptic cleavage
the folding variants of ec-sod can be identified by characterizing the peptides from unreduced tryptic digests   <cit> . the isolated ec-sod dimers were analyzed in the same way  and relevant peaks were identified by maldi-ms . the peptide val24-arg <dig>  is unaffected by the cys connectivity and was used to normalize the chromatograms to determine the ratio of aec-sod and iec-sod. this ratio does not reflect the molar level between the two folding variants, but is used as a simple measure to compare the amounts of the two variants in the collected fractions. the peptide fingerprint of the material collected in fraction  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> present aec-sod/iec-sod-ratios of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively . taking the lack of base-line separation into consideration, the analyses thus shows that the dimer collected in fraction  <dig> is likely to represent a homo-dimer composed of aec-sod . fraction  <dig> represents a hetero-dimer composed of aec-sod and iec-sod , whereas fraction  <dig> represents a homo-dimer composed of iec-sod subunits only .

discussion
we have previously analyzed purified human ec-sod subunits and shown that they fold into two distinct molecules based on different disulfide-bridge connectivity  <cit> . to simplify the analysis and data interpretation, the initial study focused on determining the disulfide connectivity of the subunits isolated by reverse phase hplc. we determined that the ec-sod subunit folds into two distinct variants called aec-sod  and iec-sod   <cit> . however, from this study it could not be determined if the folding differences were compatible with the formation of homo- and/or hetero-dimers. to investigate this, we have in the present study purified and analyzed the disulfide-linked ec-sod dimer. during the purification and analyses, rigorous measures were taken to eliminate disulfide bridge reshuffling, since both aec-sod and iec-sod contains one free cysteine residue  <cit> . the purification of ec-sod from human aorta was conducted in the cold room using neutral ph buffers and conditions compatible with maintaining the native structure. subsequent fractionation by rp-hplc was performed at low ph where disulfide bridge exchange is inhibited since the pka value of a typical thiol group is in the range of  <dig>   <cit> . in addition, prior to the separation of the disulfide-bonded dimers by rp-hplc, the protein is denatured in the presence of iodoacetic acid. moreover, we have previously shown that both iec-sod and aec-sod subunits are present in whole tissue homogenates prepared in the presence of iodoacetamide  <cit> . the identification of the three different ec-sod dimers reported in this paper is therefore not the result of disulfide bridge exchange reactions.

dimers can support the generation of five tetramers with variable activity
structural considerations suggest that the ec-sod tetramer is likely to be organized as two interacting dimers  <cit> . the characterization of the isolated ec-sod dimer is thus likely to be relevant for the quaternary structure of the intact ec-sod molecule. we show that the population of authentic ec-sod molecules purified from human aorta is composed of three different dimers providing evidence for the formation of ec-sod molecules with variable degrees of enzymatic activity . the purification of the ec-sod tetramer subclasses is likely to be difficult due to the similar biochemical properties of such molecules. however, it is the n-terminal regions that are responsible for the formation of the ec-sod tetramers  <cit>  and they are likely not affected by the difference in folding of the catalytic region. it is thus plausible that the identified dimers are able to assemble into tetramers in a random fashion and generate five different ec-sod tetramers with variable sod activity as previously hypothesized   <cit> .

spatial interactions between homo- and hetero-dimers are likely to be different
structural studies have shown that the cu/zn-sod homo-dimer is stabilized by inter-subunit hydrogen bonds between the highly conserved residues gly <dig>  gly <dig>  and ile <dig>   <cit> . similarly, these residues are involved in forming hydrogen bonds in the transient hetero-dimer composed of the cu/zn-sod copper chaperone  and cu/zn-sod during biosynthesis  <cit> . in addition to the inter-subunit hydrogen bonds, the cys57–cys <dig> disulfide bridge function as a mediator of contacts points in the cu/zn-sod homo-dimer  <cit> . the amino acid sequence of human ec-sod is consistent with the presence of similar inter-subunit hydrogen bonds within the ec-sod disulfide-bonded dimer  <cit> , however, the homologous disulfide bridge is not present in iec-sod  <cit> . based on this, the contacts within the iec-sod homo-dimer and the ai hetero-dimer are likely to be different from the interactions described for the cu/zn-sod homodimer. this implies that the ec-sod subunits function independently of inter subunit interactions described for cu/zn-sod.

CONCLUSIONS
our data show that the two folding variants of ec-sod are able to combine and form dimers and most likely also tetramers exhibiting variable sod activity. the level of sod activity in the extracellular space can thus be regulated by varying the ratio of aec-sod and iec-sod subunits in the tetramer. the mechanism responsible for this unique control of the enzymatic activity is not understood. however, it is interesting to note that the level of cu/zn-sod activity can be regulated post-translationally by the activation of a preexisting apo-pool of cu/zn-sod  <cit> . this activation mechanism is mediated by the activation of the copper chaperone for cu/zn-sod . we speculate that the existence of active and inactive ec-sod folding variants may similarly be regulated in response to oxidative stress either during folding in the endoplasmatic reticulum or via a post-translational allosteric regulation of disulfide connectivity. the present data suggests that sod activity of the ec-sod tetramer is dynamic. it will be of great importance to determine how ec-sod activity is regulated and define the role this plays in modulating the function and toxicity of oxidant radicals in extracellular spaces.
