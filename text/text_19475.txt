BACKGROUND
fungi belonging to the ascomycete genus trichoderma inhabit the soil and rhizosphere, where they interact with plant roots and with other fungi. agricultural biocontrol applications take advantage of the well-known ability of trichoderma spp. to attack and destroy fungal hosts, which is called mycoparasitism. the wide host range includes soil-borne plant pathogens such as rhizoctonia solani or pythium ultimum, which make trichoderma spp. biological plant protectants. in addition, the interaction of trichoderma with roots primes the plant’s immune system for better resistance against pathogens  <cit> . due to this induced systemic resistance, trichoderma spp. are able to protect plants against some foliar pathogens, in addition to soil-borne pathogens. plants recognize proteins secreted by the fungus, and such microbe associated  molecular patterns activate systemic resistance. the first such secreted protein to be studied in detail in trichoderma-plant interactions was a small secreted cysteine-rich protein belonging to the cerato-platanin protein  family, named sm1/epl <dig> in trichoderma virens and trichoderma atroviride, respectively  <cit> . the trichoderma genomes analyzed so far contain three genes encoding cpps  <cit> . gene expression was analyzed in t. atroviride and revealed that epl <dig> is expressed during hyphal growth, epl <dig> expression was only detected during spore maturation, and hardly any expression was found for epl <dig>  <cit> . single and double knockout strains of epl <dig> and epl <dig> did not reveal any phenotype related to hyphal growth or development.

t. atroviride and t. virens belong to distant clades within the genus trichoderma, for which so far already more than  <dig> species have been described  <cit> . analysis of the genomes of t. virens and t. atroviride revealed numerous differences in the genome inventory of these two species, which each have more than  <dig> genes that do not occur in the other species  <cit> . further, even strongly conserved genes, e.g. chitinases, have already been shown to be differentially expressed in t. atroviride and t. virens  <cit> . however, the biological consequences of these findings on the lifestyle of t. atroviride and t. virens have, as yet, only been partially understood. it is therefore important to note that it is not always valid to draw direct conclusions from the results in one species to the other. rather, one can study protein families in both of them in order to better elucidate the similarities and differences between t. atroviride and t. virens.

one example of the differences between these two species are the cpp orthologues sm <dig> and epl <dig>  t. virens sm <dig> was shown to induce plant defense responses, but this ability is far weaker for its homologue t. atroviride epl <dig>  <cit> . this was explained by different tendencies of these proteins to dimerize. only monomers of sm <dig> and epl <dig> were shown to efficiently induce plant defense responses. while epl <dig> is readily able to form dimers, sm <dig> has a single glycosylation site that is not present in epl <dig> and is predominantly found in its monomeric form, which is more effective in the induction of plant defense responses  <cit> .

the ability of cpp family members of trichoderma from other phylogenetic branches to promote systemic resistance in plants has not been studied yet. in this study, we generated knockout strains of t. virens sm <dig> and sm <dig> and analyzed them for developmental phenotypes and for their ability to induce resistance of maize to the southern corn leaf blight pathogen cochliobolus heterostrophus. plant experiments were also carried out with t. atroviride epl <dig> and epl <dig> knockout strains  <cit> .

RESULTS
gene expression of cpp-encoding genes in t. virens
the genome of t. virens gv29- <dig> contains three genes, sm <dig>  sm <dig> and sm <dig>  encoding cpps . this is in analogy to the genomes of t. atroviride and t. reesei, which also contain three cpp genes  <cit> . the genes sm <dig> and sm <dig> and their respective proteins have not been studied yet. in order to assess the transcriptional profiles of all three genes encoding cpps in t. virens, their expression was first analyzed with rt-pcr. while the sm <dig> gene was found to be expressed during hyphal growth, no expression was observed for sm <dig> and sm <dig> at these time points . in biomass harvested from sporulating cultures grown on potato dextrose agar  plates during different stages of spore maturation, ranging from mycelium covered with white conidia to first light green and then dark green conidia, sm <dig> was found to be strongly upregulated, but sm <dig> was also found to be expressed . for sm <dig> no expression was detected under the tested growth conditions.figure  <dig>

generation and characterization of sm <dig> and sm <dig> knockout strains
based on these gene expression results, gene knockout strains of sm <dig> and sm <dig> were generated in t. virens i <dig> Δtku <dig>  <cit>  as described in the methods section . since sm <dig> was previously shown to be far more potent in inducing plant defense responses than epl <dig>  <cit>  and the lack of sm <dig> strongly reduces the ability of t. virens to induce plant defense responses  <cit> , we were interested to test whether sm <dig> has a similar function in t. virens. phylogenetically sm <dig> belongs to a different branch of cpps  <cit>  and none of these proteins have been studied so far. since sm <dig> is expressed throughout different growth stages and a possible function of cpps in fungal growth has been discussed in the literature  <cit> , the generated knockout strains were tested for phenotypic alterations with respect to the following properties related to fungal growth: growth on agar plates , formation of aerial hyphae, growth along  surfaces, bridging of gaps between two agar blocks, and transition of hyphae between solid/liquid interfaces. different types of desiccation stress, e.g. drying of water droplets and drying of thin agar plates, were also examined. furthermore, we analyzed conidiation, biomass formation in shake flask cultivations, germination efficiency, hydrophobicity of the mycelium, chlamydospore formation, osmotic stress, and cell wall stress . no morphological differences between the parental strain and the knockout strains were found in t. virens, which is similar to t. atroviride, where no phenotype had been detected in epl <dig> and epl <dig> single and double knockout strains  <cit> . at advanced time points  of shake flask cultivations of t. virens abundant formation of chlamydospores was detected . a correlation between chlamydospore formation and cp  gene expression had been reported for ceratocystis platani  <cit> , but no differences were detected between the parental strain and the knockout strains in t. virens.figure  <dig>

the mycoparasitic potential of the knockout strains was also not altered based on confrontation assays of t. virens against r. solani  and botrytis cinerea .

we had found in a previous study that the expression of t. atroviride epl <dig>  the homologue of t. virens sm <dig>  is not constant during hyphal growth but its expression level is strongly dependent on parameters that influence the growth rate   <cit> . we therefore paid particular attention to this aspect in the knockout strains and assessed the gene expression of sm <dig> quantitatively with qpcr in the sm <dig> knockout strain and the parental strain Δtku <dig> . the results  showed that sm <dig> has a slightly different expression profile in the sm <dig> knockout strain compared to the parental strain, but we were not able to elucidate this further due to the lack of any detectable morphological changes in the knockout strains.figure  <dig>

t. virens strain i <dig> is a q-strain
t. virens strains can be grouped into p- and q-strains, based on their antibiotic profiles. strains of the q-group produce the antibiotic gliotoxin and are generally considered to be more effective biocontrol agents  <cit> . the spectrum of secondary metabolites that is produced has a profound effect on the plant protection potential and mycoparasitic activity of t. virens  <cit> . previous studies on sm <dig> were carried out in strain gv29- <dig>  which is a q-strain  <cit> . in order to relate our experiments on the role of sm <dig>  in the interaction of t. virens with plants  more directly to previous studies  <cit> , we were interested whether strain i <dig>  which we used for our studies  <cit> , is a p or a q-strain. t. virens sm <dig> – but not sm <dig> – knockout strains have been previously studied in strain gv29- <dig>  both strains, i <dig> and gv29- <dig>  were grown for 36 h in shake flask cultivations in liquid potato dextrose broth medium and gliotoxin production was measured from filtered culture supernatants. the results  showed that i <dig> produced  <dig>  mg/l gliotoxin, an amount similar to strain gv29- <dig> , and strain i <dig> can therefore also be attributed to the group of q-strains of t. virens, which is of particular relevance for the discussion of our plant experiments .

sm <dig> and sm <dig> knockout strains show reduced levels of plant protection
in order to test whether sm <dig> is involved in the interaction of trichoderma with plants we analyzed whether the lack of sm <dig> leads to an altered potential to protect plants against fungal pathogens. for this, the interaction of c. heterostrophus with its host, maize, was used as a model pathosystem. we have recently standardized this system  and it was used previously with trichoderma asperellum . the t. virens parental and sm <dig> knockout strains were also included, and in addition experiments were performed with t. atroviride wild-type, epl <dig> and epl <dig> knockout strains generated in a previous study  <cit> . lesion sizes on maize plants, whose roots were co-cultured with the t. virens parental strain Δtku <dig> or sm <dig> and sm <dig> knockout strains, were measured . colonization of maize roots by the t. virens parental strain significantly decreased symptoms by more than 40%. plants colonized by ∆sm <dig> showed impaired resistance in comparison to plants treated with the t. virens parental strain, but were still significantly different from control plants, showing about 30% decrease in lesion size. knock-out of sm <dig>  however, led to a much more dramatic decrease in the ability of the fungus to induce resistance in maize, resulting in large lesions which were similar to the lesions of the control plants . in order to assess the gene expression of sm-genes in t. virens during plant interaction, root biomass was harvested from plant experiments four days post inoculation with t. virens conidia and analyzed by qpcr. loss of one sm-gene might affect the expression of the other through feedback in the signaling network. the results  showed, overall, no strong changes in gene expression of the other sm-gene. the expression of sm <dig> was not altered in the Δsm <dig> strain. sm <dig> expression tended to be higher in Δsm <dig> than in the parental strain, but this was not statistically significant.figure  <dig>

plant experiments were also carried out with t. atroviride epl <dig> and epl <dig> single and double knockout strains that were generated in a previous study  <cit> . while plants treated with the t. virens parental strain showed more than 40% reduction in lesion size, the lesion size in plants treated with the t. atroviride imi <dig> wild-type strain was only 13% smaller than in the control plants . despite the relatively poor plant protection potential of t. atroviride, we observed exactly the same trend regarding ability of ∆epl <dig> and ∆epl <dig> strains to protect plants as for the corresponding mutants in t. virens. in addition, lesion sizes on plants colonized by the double knockout strain ∆epl1∆epl <dig> were not significantly different from ∆epl <dig> treated plants and control plants .

discussion
in this study the gene expression of the three genes encoding cpps in t. virens was analyzed. in analogy to previous results from t. atroviride, sm <dig> was found to be expressed during hyphal growth, i.e. under growth conditions when sufficient nutrients are available and fast biomass formation occurs. for sm <dig> gene expression was detected in mycelium that was harvested from sporulating cultures. since the formation of conidia is associated with differentiation of the hyphae to form conidiophores and phialides, sm <dig> gene expression could also be associated with these structures, but it is unfortunately not possible to separate them efficiently. it should be noted that in shake flask cultivations, where, according to our microscopic observations, large amounts of chlamydospores - which directly split off from hyphae - but no conidia, were formed, no expression of sm <dig> was found . this indicates that sm <dig> gene expression is connected to the formation and maturation of conidia but not to other types of spores in t. virens. it should be noted that, due to morphological differences of the mycelium on agar plates between t. atroviride and t. virens, in t. atroviride the harvested biomass from sporulating cultures consists mainly of spores, whereas in t. virens i <dig> the mycelium is fluffier and the harvested biomass is therefore a mixture of spores and hyphae. this probably explains why in t. virens expression of sm <dig> and sm <dig> was detected in these samples, whereas in t. atroviride strong epl <dig> expression but only weak epl <dig> expression was found. sm <dig> is also expressed in co-culture with maize .

our transcriptional data for sm <dig> are in agreement with findings by djonovic et al.  <cit> , who reported expression under all tested conditions, including sporulating and non-sporulating mycelia. in other fungi there is also evidence that homologues of sm <dig> are expressed during hyphal growth, e.g. in b. cinerea, bcspl <dig> was found to be expressed under many different growth conditions, whereas no expression was found for bcspl <dig>  a second cp gene  <cit> . mgsm <dig> from magnaporthe grisea was also expressed during different fungal growth stages  <cit> . in addition to these gene expression data, the protein epl <dig> was found to be the predominant protein in the secretome of submerged t. atroviride cultivations with glucose as a carbon source  <cit> . in the plant pathogenic basidiomycete moniliophthora perniciosa gene expression data of the  <dig> cp genes  showed complex transcriptional profiles throughout fungal development and pathogenic infestation of the plant, suggesting a specialization of the respective proteins in different biological processes  <cit> . in ascomycetes, gene expression data are so far limited to homologues of sm <dig> except for epl <dig> and epl <dig> from t. atroviride and bcspl <dig> from b. cinerea . it will be of interest for future studies to obtain more expression data for these genes, in particular considering the strong effect of the lack of sm <dig> on the ability of trichoderma to protect maize from c. heterostrophus in our plant experiments .

the mycoparasitic potential of sm-knockout strains against r. solani and b. cinerea was not altered and it can be anticipated that this would also be the case for other host fungi. nonetheless sm-knockout strains have a strong effect on the biocontrol properties of t. virens via direct effects on the trichoderma-plant interaction. in the t. virens gv <dig> -maize - colletotrichum graminicola interaction, loss of sm <dig> resulted in complete loss of the capacity to reduce lesion size on the leaves  <cit> . a single protein might seem unlikely to be responsible, alone, for the induction of systemic resistance. however, it seems that in the maize c. graminicola interaction sm <dig> is indeed the dominant player. in the maize - cochliobolus assay used in this study, on the other hand, knock-out of sm <dig> reduced the plant protection potential of t. virens, but in this pathosystem the lack of sm <dig> had an even greater effect and lesion size of maize leaves was statistically not different from the control . although the colonization efficiency of maize roots by t. virens was not directly measured, it should be noted that upon harvesting of plant roots for biomass extraction for qpcr experiments, no obvious phenotypes in fungal growth and the appearance of the colonized roots were observed. in plant experiments with t. atroviride plant protection levels were overall lower than with t. virens, but the same trend was observed for epl <dig> and epl <dig> knockout strains as for sm <dig> and sm <dig> knockout strains, confirming that sm2/epl <dig> are, in the c. heterostrophus-maize pathosystem, more important for plant protection than sm1/epl <dig>  this is also relevant because it underlines that the observed effect is not due to any unwanted, genetic side-effects of the knockout strains or due a particular feature of the t. virens strain used. the t. atroviride double knockout strain Δepl1Δepl <dig> appeared slightly  less effective than the Δepl <dig> strain . these data are compatible with an additive contribution of sm <dig> and sm <dig>  and the contribution of these two paralogs to the induction of resistance is similar for t. virens and t. atroviride. the data in figure  <dig> provide genetic evidence that for maximal induction of resistance, both paralogs need to be present. in contrast to maize- c. graminicola, where sm <dig> dominates, sm <dig> appears to be the dominant one in this particular assay. since sm <dig> expression was not found to be altered in the sm <dig> deletion strain in plant experiments it can be concluded that reduction of the capacity to protect the plant was directly due to the absence of sm <dig> 

when comparing the c. graminicola to the c. heterostrophus pathosystem assays, it is important to note that the assay here was done using hydroponic cultures rather than soil-grown plants, which could affect the relative extent of colonization, intensity of isr and contribution of specific secreted proteins. to maximize the potential of trichoderma spp. to protect plants, expression of different combinations of cpp family members, at different levels, will need to be tested, in different pathosystems.

CONCLUSIONS
cpps are potent inducers of plant defense responses in plant pathogenic fungi as well as plant-beneficial fungi such as trichoderma species. in this study we showed that t. virens sm <dig> knockout strains were more impaired in the protection of maize seedlings against the pathogen c. heterostrophus than sm <dig> knockout strains. t. atroviride was overall less effective in plant protection than t. virens, but the same trend was observed for the respective epl <dig> and epl <dig> knockout strains. these findings advance our understanding of the diversified functions of cpps in fungi and of the pool of molecules that are involved in the beneficial interaction of trichoderma with plants. our results show that the paradigm of sm <dig> as the main or exclusive inducer of plant systemic resistance triggered by trichoderma-root interactions needs to be generalized. as we have shown that in the particular interaction studied here sm <dig> is even more important than sm <dig>  it seems likely that even more elicitors remain to be discovered in trichoderma.
