BACKGROUND
genome research in agriculturally important species is facilitated by the availability of species-specific molecular genetic tools and resources such as chromosome maps and large volumes of sequence data. recently such resources have been developed for important aquaculture species including rainbow trout, which are also widely used as a model system for carcinogenesis, toxicological, and comparative immunological research  <cit> .

several genetic maps  <cit>  consisting primarily of type ii markers  <cit>   have been utilized in the identification of qualitative and quantitative trait loci   <cit>  associated with rainbow trout production traits. this includes qtl for natural killer cell-like activity, temperature tolerance, spawning date, body weight, resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis virus , resistance to infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus , embryonic development rate, and albinism  <cit> . although the genetic improvement of these traits through selective breeding would benefit the aquaculture industry, these qtl span large chromosomal intervals and will not be practical for marker assisted selection  <cit>  without additional mapping. the current rainbow trout genetic maps lack marker densities and comparative information necessary to conduct fine mapping aimed at reducing qtl interval sizes, developing practical marker assisted selection schemes, and selection of comparative positional candidates  <cit>  to specifically identify the gene affecting traits of interest.

the recent evolutionary divergence of the salmonids  <cit>  and the importance of many of these species to aquaculture will allow for comparative qtl mapping. for example, the development of genetic linkage maps for atlantic salmon and arctic char  <cit>  has enabled the identification of qtls for growth characteristics, disease resistance, and temperature tolerance in those species  <cit> . the development of microsatellites markers from est sequences will facilitate the use of genome information in salmonids species by 1) increasing type ii  <cit>  marker densities on genetic maps; 2) integrating physical and genetic maps; 3) developing comparative genetic maps among salmonids; and 4) developing comparative maps with aquatic model organisms such as zebrafish, fugu, and tetraodon and with better studied avian and mammalian species. this comparative information will aid in the identification of positional candidate genes  <cit>  for production traits in salmonid aquaculture and for basic research which utilizes rainbow trout as model organism.

an expressed sequence tag   <cit>  project was initiated for rainbow trout with the following aims: 1) identify as many unique transcribed sequences as possible; 2) annotate sequence data with information from other species; 3) develop functional genome tools for rainbow trout; and 4) identify microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism  genetic markers for the construction of high-density chromosome maps  <cit> . sequences from a normalized cdna library  constructed from brain, gill, liver, muscle, kidney, and spleen tissue resulted in the creation of the rainbow trout gene index   <cit> . microsatellite marker development was conducted simultaneously with the sequencing phase of the project through hybridization of  <dig> and  <dig> probes to high-density filters representing  <dig>  clones from the library. positive clones were selected for further analyses resulting in  <dig> polymorphic microsatellite markers derived from ests,  <dig> which were informative in mapping reference families,  <dig> were associated with functional annotation, and  <dig> for which comparative mapping assignments were determined.

RESULTS
marker development
hybridization of high-density filters representing  <dig>  cdna clones from a normalized cdna library with  <dig> and  <dig> oligonucleotide probes identified  <dig> clones potentially containing microsatellite repeats. forward and reverse sequencing for  <dig> of these clones resulted in  <dig> sequences of good quality . dinucleotide microsatellite repeat were identified from  <dig> clone sequences. analysis of redundancy identified  <dig> unique sequences. pcr primer design was possible for  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences which were assigned locus names using omm <dig> nomenclature . pcr optimization was successful for  <dig> of the  <dig> primer pairs. testing for polymorphism in three reference parents and five doubled haploids resulted in the development of  <dig> polymorphic microsatellites markers with an average of  <dig>  alleles , 40% of which were duplicated as determined by the observance of multiple alleles in clonal lines . cross-amplification in other salmonid species using pcr conditions that were optimized for rainbow trout was determined  to be similar to markers from previous publications  <cit> .

functional annotation
functional annotations were associated with ests by blast analyses of the rtgi which previously included est sequence data for the clones described in this manuscript. the highest scoring matches all had e-values ranging from  <dig> to 10- <dig> and percent identities ranging from 91– <dig> % . tigr gene index annotation for tentative consensus sequences  includes three levels of significance based on percent identity: matches in the range of  <dig> to 100% are categorized as "homologues," matches in the range of 70–90% are categorized as "similar," and matches less than 70% are categorized as "weakly similar." annotation of ests in this manuscript resulted in  <dig> highly significant matches to genome sequences,  <dig> categorized as homologues,  <dig> as similar,  <dig> as weakly similar, and  <dig> for which no associations were determined locus or gene symbols from locus link  <cit>  or uniprot  <cit>  were added to  <dig> loci designated as homologues.

genetic and comparative mapping
linkage analyses of  <dig> informative markers resulted in the assignment of  <dig> markers to linkage groups . twenty-three markers were informative in the reference families of sakamoto et al.  <cit>  and  <dig> markers were placed on the map of nichols et al.  <cit>  in addition to  <dig> which were not included into previous linkage groups . comparisons to zebrafish and fugu databases identified homologous assignments for  <dig> ests each , however, the chromosomal assignments in these  <dig> species are not yet available.

discussion
microsatellite marker development
marker development strategies for the construction of high-density genetic maps typically utilize random or targeted approaches. random approaches are commonly employed in the early phases of the map construction and are characterized by the use of sequence data not associated with mapping or functional annotation for marker development. in targeted approaches, commonly employed to increase marker density in a specific chromosome region or to map genes of interest, only sequence data meeting specified parameters with respect to mapping or function are utilized for marker development. our approach for increasing the marker densities of rainbow trout genetic maps was a hybrid of random and targeted approaches. although clones for marker development were not chosen based on functional annotation, the sequence data utilized were known to be transcribed. the benefit of this approach is that these microsatellites are type i and ii markers  <cit> , serving to increase marker densities on both genetic and comparative maps. similar strategies have been employed in the development of microsatellite markers for other agriculturally important animals including sheep, turkey, cattle, catfish, and pig  <cit> .

cross amplification within the salmonidae
salmonids are believed to have diverged from a common tetraploid ancestor some  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . as a result of this evolutionarily recent divergence, microsatellite markers can be used in the development of comparative genetic maps among the salmonidae. cross-species amplification was obtained for  <dig> markers and ranged between 83% and 97% per species, with observed polymorphism that ranged between 36% and 82% per marker. sampling additional individuals from multiple populations is likely to increase observations of polymorphism. this high level of cross-amplification and polymorphism should facilitate the development of comparative and genetic maps for the salmonids.

functional annotation
the rtgi was used to associate ests with functional annotation as their sequence data was previously included in rtgi version  <dig> . unfortunately, 42% of the markers were not associated with any annotation, demonstrating an overall lack of functional annotation of the rainbow trout transcriptome.

genetic and comparative mapping
the goal of the activities outlined in this manuscript was to identify homologous regions of chromosomes between rainbow trout and species for which there is an abundance of genome information including whole genome sequence. eight regions of homology were identified between trout and tetraodon, seven with human, and  <dig> with mouse . although mapping single loci does not identify segments of conserved synteny, the homologies reported in this paper are supported by the examination of direct comparative information between tetraodon and human and mouse. for instance, omm <dig> was observed to be homologous with tni  <dig>  hsa <dig>  and mmu <dig>  the ncbi human/mouse comparative map  <cit>  reveals a homologous region between hsa  <dig> and mmu  <dig>  and the tetraodon comparative map  <cit>  reveals regions of homology between tni <dig> and both hsa <dig> and mmu <dig>  similar analyses of comparative assignments in two or more species supported our findings for every marker reported.

CONCLUSIONS
this project was initiated at a time where very little sequence data was publicly available for salmonid species. now the rtgi contains over  <dig>  ests which represent ~  <dig>  unique sequences. current methods to develop new microsatellite markers from est sequences would most likely replace hybridization with an in silico strategy on the rtgi data set. therefore, the continuation of microsatellite marker development from expressed sequence tag data is feasible and will be useful for developing comparative maps with other salmonids and with better studied species.
