BACKGROUND
upland cotton , as a tetraploid cotton, produces 97 % of lint fibers for the textile industry in the world, while extra-long staple  cotton , also known as sea-island, american pima, or egyptian cotton accounts for about 3 % of the world cotton. however, various diseases cause substantial yield losses in cotton . verticillium wilt , caused by the soil-borne fungus verticillium dahliae kleb., and fusarium wilt , caused by the soil-borne fungus fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum  synd. & hans, are two most destructive diseases in cotton production in the world. vw and fw can significantly reduce cotton yield and fiber quality due to leaf chlorosis, necrosis or wilting, leaf and boll abscission and plant death  <cit> . root-knot nematodes  and reniform nematodes  cause the highest yield loss  in the u.s.  <cit> . planting disease resistant cultivars is the most effective and economical control method.

many g. barbadense genotypes are known to carry high levels of resistance to vw , but its resistance has not been successfully transferred into commercial upland cotton due to hybrid breakdown except for introgressed breeding lines  <cit> . there have been many studies indicating that the vw resistance in g. barbadense is controlled by a dominant or partially dominant gene in interspecific crosses between g. barbadense and g. hirsutum. in several recent studies, more than  <dig> vw resistance quantitative trait loci  in the interspecific upland × pima populations and also intra- upland populations have been detected on almost all of the  <dig> tetraploid cotton chromosomes  except for c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  and vw resistance qtls were more frequently detected on c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> .

a number of qualitative genetic studies have identified five major resistance genes against fw in upland  and pima  including fw <dig>  fw <dig>  fwr , fov <dig>  and fov <dig> . there are also numerous quantitative genetic studies using early segregating populations confirming the predominant presence of additive gene effects with low heritabilities on fw resistance. several recent mapping studies have collectively detected approximately  <dig> qtls on all the  <dig> tetraploid cotton chromosomes except for c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> .

in upland cotton, high rkn resistance was achieved in auburn 623rkn through crossing between moderately resistant clevewilt and wild mexico jack jones, which was then transferred to other breeding lines  <cit> . the resistance was later determined to be controlled by two genes through a classic genetic analysis  <cit> , and the two genes  were mapped to chromosomes c <dig> from clevewilt and c <dig> from wild mexico jack jones through a collective research effort  <cit> . in an interspecific recombinant inbred line population of two susceptible parents of upland and pima cotton, major qtls  and  <dig> putative qtls for rkn responses were reported  <cit> .

for rn, the high level of resistance  in g. longicalyx was transferred to upland cotton  <cit> , and the resistance is conferred by a single dominant gene renlon located on chromosome c <dig>  <cit> . moderate resistance was also found in several g. barbadense accessions including gb  <dig>  <cit> . three resistance qtls  were identified in gb  <dig> in a cross with acala nem-x using ssr markers  <cit> , and one of the two qtls on c <dig> was later identified as a major qtl through snp mapping  <cit> . in a cross between a tri-species hybrid g. arboreum ×  and upland md51ne, a major dominant resistance gene renari also on c <dig> presumably from g. aridum was identified using ssr markers  <cit> .

the consistency and utility of most resistance qtls in breeding and genomic research identified for the above four major diseases remain uncertain. because most qtl studies used early segregating populations such as f <dig>  bc1f <dig> and f2: <dig>  disease resistance could not be repeatedly evaluated for the same genotypes. however, qtls as reported from different studies provide a good opportunity to perform a meta-analysis of resistance qtls for identification of consistent resistance qtls for the same disease  and common qtls for different diseases  across different studies. qtl clusters for resistance to different diseases and resistance qtl hotspots for the same disease will be very useful for breeders and geneticists to choose chromosome regions for marker-assisted selection and high resolution mapping of disease resistance qtls or genes.

it is currently known that plant disease resistance is often conferred by disease resistance  genes including predominantly nucleotide-binding site - encoding genes  <cit> . r genes have evolved and clustered on the plant genome through various mechanisms such as tandem and segmental gene duplications, recombination, unequal crossing-over, point mutations, and diversifying selection. recent genome sequencing studies have identified  <dig> and  <dig> nbs-encoding genes in g. raimondii and g. arboreum, respectively . however, the relationship between the distribution of the nbs genes and resistance qtls or genes is unclear in cotton.

the objectives of this study were to perform a qtl analysis of vw resistance from multiple years of replicated tests on a backcross inbred line  population of an interspecific upland × pima cross and a meta-analysis of qtls and genes resistant to vw, fw, rkn and rn identified and reported previously. relationships between the resistance qtls and nbs genes on cotton chromosomes were also analyzed.

RESULTS
qtl mapping for vw resistance in the bil population
in the bil population of  <dig> lines tested in four years, we detected a total of  <dig> qtls for vw resistance based on a linkage map with  <dig> polymorphic ssr loci spanning a total genetic distance of  <dig>  cm as established by yu et al.  <cit> . the qtls were distributed on  <dig> chromosomes . these qtls included two detected in  <dig> and  <dig> each, five in  <dig> and one in  <dig>  two vw-qtls were located on chromosome c <dig> within a 25-cm region, while another two qtls were on c <dig> in the same region with the same marker interval. other six qtls were located on c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> with one qtl each. the vw resistance qtls were further mapped onto a consensus map , which shows that vw resistance qtls on these eight chromosomes were also reported by others previously.table  <dig> qtl for verticillium wilt  resistance detected in a backcross inbred line  population of  <dig> lines derived from a cross of  × sg  <dig> bc2f4

as shown in table  <dig>  the lod scores for these qtls ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , significant based on permutation tests, and phenotypic variation explained  by each qtl ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. six qtls that were from the resistance parent giza  <dig> decreased verticillium wilt incidents or severity ratings with higher pve , while other four qtls from the susceptible parent sg  <dig> increased verticillium wilt incidents or severity ratings with lower pve .

clusters of disease resistance qtls
a total of  <dig> disease resistance qtls have been reported including  <dig> vw resistance qtls identified in this study , with  <dig> vw resistance qtls accounting for 63 % of the disease qtls identified in past studies, followed by rkn  and fw . chromosomes c <dig> carried the most resistance qtls , followed by c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , and c <dig> . chromosomes c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> each carried 10– <dig> qtls; c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> each carried 6– <dig> qtls; c <dig> carried no resistance qtls; and the remaining chromosomes  carried the least number of qtls .table  <dig> numbers of quantitative trait loci  resistant to verticillium wilt , fusarium wilt , root-knot nematodes , reniform nematodes , bacterial blight  and black root rot  that were identified in this study and reported in other studies



for the distribution of resistance qtls on homeologous chromosomes, four pairs carried more qtls including three pairs with similar numbers . however, c <dig> carried twice qtls than its homeologous counterpart c <dig> . four pairs carried less but with similar numbers of qtls . among other five pairs carrying a few qtls, three a-subgenome chromosomes carried less ; and two other a-subgenome chromosomes carried more . however, the number of qtls carried between homeologous chromosomes was significantly and positively correlated . overall, the a-subgenome carried  <dig> qtls, which was slightly fewer than the d-subgenome . however, the difference was not statistically significant .

based on the selection criterion that  <dig> qtls within a 25-cm region constitute a cluster,  <dig> qtl clusters  on  <dig> chromosomes  were identified , and they contained  <dig> resistance qtls . the difference in distribution of clusters on the a- and d- subgenomes was not significant . the first region  on the chromosomes of the cotton genome contained most qtl clusters , followed by the second region at 25–50 cm with  <dig> clusters; and the third region at 60– <dig> cm and the fourth region at 75–100 cm only carried  <dig> clusters each. across the cotton genome, the difference in distribution of clusters in the four regions was highly significant . there were no clusters on c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  chromosomes c <dig> and c <dig> each carried  <dig> clusters, while c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> each carried  <dig> clusters. however, some of the clusters did not contain any qtl hotspot  including c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig>  and c <dig> . some of the clusters may contain qtl hotspots after more qtl mapping results are reported in the future. in the following sections, clusters containing resistance qtl hotspots for each disease will be analyzed in more details.table  <dig> resistance qtl clusters and hotspots identified for verticillium wilt , fusarium wilt , rootknot nematodes  and reniform nematodes

comparing the distribution of qtl clusters between homeologous chromosomes , c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> did not have any clusters identified, while their counterparts  each had one cluster. however, c <dig> had one cluster while its homeologous chromosome c <dig> carried no cluster, nor the homeologous pair c <dig> and c <dig> carried any clusters. homeologous chromosome pair c <dig> and c <dig> each carried one cluster in similar regions with qtls for vw and rkn resistance identified, while other three pairs  each carried 2– <dig> clusters. for c <dig> and c <dig>  3– <dig> vw qtls were identified in the similar region , while the second cluster differed in map positions and types of qtls between the two chromosomes. for c <dig> and c <dig>  the first cluster had  <dig> vw qtls; the second cluster differed in qtl types, while the third cluster had the same qtl type but differed in positions. for c <dig> and c <dig>  the first cluster in a similar position only had  <dig> qtls in common for the same traits, while the second cluster differed in qtl type and position. interestingly, for homeologous pair c <dig> and c <dig>  both had  <dig> vw qtls in a similar region . however, c <dig> carried  <dig> clusters , while c <dig> carried one cluster with only  <dig> qtls. for another homeologous pair c <dig>  and c <dig> , both had qtls for vw and fw resistance in the same region .

meta-analysis of verticillium wilt  and fusarium wilt  resistance qtls
of a total of  <dig> qtls for vw resistance,  <dig> and  <dig> were distributed on the a- and d- subgenomes, respectively . but the difference in qtls between the two subgenomes was not statistically significant . except for chromosomes c <dig> and c <dig>  all chromosomes carried vw resistance qtls. chromosome c <dig> carried the most qtls , followed by c <dig> with  <dig> and c <dig> with  <dig>  chromosomes c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> each carried 11– <dig> qtls, while c <dig> and c <dig> carried 7– <dig> qtls. due to the concentration of qtls in regions, c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , and c <dig>  each carried one hotspot with 4– <dig> vw resistance qtls, while c <dig> and c <dig> each carried  <dig> hotspots, and c <dig> carried  <dig> hotspots . on c <dig>  the three hotspots were distributed at 0– <dig>  30– <dig>  and 50–65 cm with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> qtls, respectively. on c <dig>  at two distal regions  from the centromere, the two hotspots each contained 4– <dig> qtls. on c <dig>  the hotspot at 0–25 cm had  <dig> qtls concentrated for vw resistance, while the one at 35–45 cm had only  <dig> vw resistance qtls. the above  <dig> hotspots contained  <dig> individual vw resistance qtls  and a few qtls for fw or rkn resistance. of the  <dig> vw resistance qtls identified,  <dig>  were located in disease resistance qtl clusters.

all  <dig> fw resistance qtls reported on  <dig> chromosomes were located in resistance qtl clusters,  <dig> of which were located on three chromosomes c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> . the relevant regions  on these three chromosomes  each carried a qtl hotspot for fw resistance . it is interesting to note that the same region on c <dig> also carried a qtl hotspot with  <dig> qtls for vw resistance. therefore, this region may have resistance genes for both vw and fw.

meta-analysis of root-knot nematode  and reniform nematode  resistance qtls
for rkn resistance, a total of  <dig> qtls were identified on  <dig> chromosomes ,  <dig> of which were located on c <dig>  followed by c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , and c <dig> . chromosomes c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> each carried 1– <dig> rkn resistance qtls, and the remaining chromosomes did not carry any rkn resistance qtls. eight qtl hotspots were identified including two each on c <dig> and c <dig> , and one each on c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , and c <dig> . two major rkn resistance genes or qtls with major effects from auburn 623rkn and its derived lines, as reported previously  <cit> , have been confirmed in the hotspot regions of c <dig> with  <dig> qtls and c <dig> with  <dig> qtls. of the  <dig> rkn qtls identified,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were located within  <dig> resistance qtl clusters and the  <dig> rkn resistance qtl hotspots, respectively .

of the six qtls reported for reniform nematode  resistance, c <dig> carried five, while c <dig> carried one. since the five qtls on c <dig> were scattered along the whole chromosome, there was no qtl hotspot identified. however, c <dig> carried one major dominant resistance gene renlon transferred from g. longicalyx, and it was in a close proximity to the two rkn resistance qtl hotspots with  <dig> qtl identified including one of the two major resistance genes for rkn resistance . therefore, this c <dig> region carries important resistance genes for both rkn and rn resistance.

qtls for resistance to bacterial blight  and black root rot 
due to the rflp markers used by wright et al.  <cit> , the bb resistance qtls could not be placed on the consensus map in this study. however, three reported qtls resistant to brr were mapped onto c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> of the consensus map . the one on c <dig> was close to a qtl cluster with  <dig> rkn and  <dig> vw qtls, while the other two qtls were distant from others.

identification of linked markers to the disease resistance qtl clusters and hotspot
the closely linked ssr markers for the  <dig> disease resistance qtl clusters involving  <dig> vw resistance hotspots,  <dig> fw resistance hotspots and  <dig> rkn resistance hotspots are listed in table  <dig>  the information should be useful to breeders and geneticists.

association between number of resistance qtls and number of nucleotide-binding site -encoding genes
based on the sequenced genomes in g. raimondii  and g. arboreum ,  <dig> and  <dig> nbs-coding genes were identified, respectively  <cit> . the significantly higher number of nbs genes in g. raimondii than in g. arboreum  may explain why the d subgenome carried more disease resistance qtls than the a subgenome in the tetraploid cotton. the number of nbs genes and the number of qtls identified on the  <dig> d-subgenome chromosomes were positively correlated , while the correlation was significant with the number of total disease resistance qtls on homeologous a-subgenome chromosomes . the sum of qtls in  <dig> pairs of homeologous chromosomes was also significantly correlated with the number of nbs-coding genes . the correlation with the number vw qtls on a- and d- subgenome chromosomes was also positive but insignificant ; however, the correlation with the number of rkn qtls on the a subgenome chromosomes was significant . therefore, there is a trend that the more nbs-encoding genes a chromosome carries, the more disease resistance qtls it has. for example, chromosome  <dig>  carried the most number of nbs genes , and its homeologous pair of upland cotton  carried a total of  <dig> qtls . chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in d <dig> carried  <dig> and  <dig> nbs genes, respectively, and their homeologous pairs  carried a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  qtls, respectively. chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in d <dig> contained a minimum numbers of nbs genes , their corresponding tetraploid chromosomes  also carried the least numbers of qtls . however, three chromosomes  in d <dig> also had high numbers of nbs genes , but their tetraploid counterparts  only carried moderate numbers of qtls . surprisingly, chromosomes  <dig> in d <dig> carried a small number of nbs genes , but its tetraploid counterparts  carried a high number of qtls .

furthermore, the number of nbs genes was significantly correlated with the number of qtl clusters on a- and d- subgenome chromosomes and the sum of the homeologous chromosomes . for example, chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with high numbers of nbs genes each had a total of 3– <dig> clusters in their tetraploid counterparts. since nbs genes on these chromosomes with high numbers of nbs genes are clustered, the results indicate that the disease resistance qtl clusters may be in part determined by nbs gene clusters. however, the reverse is true for chromosome  <dig> with only  <dig> nbs genes in the d <dig> genome, while its tetraploid counterparts carried  <dig> clusters. this result indicates that either these nbs genes may have pleiotropic effects on multiple diseases or other genes on the chromosome are involved in quantitative resistance.

discussion
difficulties in screening cotton for vw resistance
in this study, a bil population of  <dig> lines was tested in 2– <dig> replications  through 4-years replicated field tests. disease resistance was determined by an average severity rating from 54– <dig> individual plants for each genotype, therefore rendering low experimental errors than most previous vw resistance studies. however, only  <dig> vw resistance qtls on  <dig> chromosomes were identified. on two chromosome regions, two qtls were identified in the same or similar regions. on the  <dig> chromosomes where the  <dig> qtls were mapped, vw resistance qtls were also mapped by previous studies. in fact,  <dig> qtls were mapped onto three chromosomes  with vw qtl hotspots. therefore, the results in this study demonstrated a moderate level of consistency in qtl mapping for vw resistance based on the multiple years of replicated studies. the results also demonstrated difficulties in vw resistance studies even if inbred lines are evaluated for vw resistance in multiple replicated field tests with or without inoculations.

as zhang et al.  <cit>  noted, it is difficult to reliably identify vw and fw resistance qtls. there are a number of contributing factors to the complication of disease resistance studies. first, many early segregating populations were used in disease resistance qtl mapping, which did not allow repeated evaluation of the same genotypes from multiple individuals in multiple replications and multiple environments. experimental errors were understandably higher. second, vw and fw disease infections are highly sensitive to environmental and developmental factors, and even artificial inoculations could not achieve similar disease infections in the same genotypes  <cit> . thirdly, an artificial grading system for disease severity is often used, rendering it very difficult to quantitatively and accurately phenotype cotton responses to the diseases. fourth, there exist interactions of genotype with environment, strains of a pathogen, and evaluation methods, resulting in different disease responses of the same genotypes to different strains of pathogens under different environmental conditions or using different inoculation methods. furthermore, most disease resistance qtls have low contributions to disease resistance, which could not be detected in many environmental conditions where experimental errors for resistance screening are higher. finally, low genome coverage of molecular markers in many mapping studies does not allow a genome-wide detection of qtls with a high resolution, resulting in different qtls identified from different genetic populations evaluated under different environmental and screening conditions. all of these issues call for reliable screening techniques and phenotyping of disease resistance in mapping populations with multiple individuals in each genotype using multiple replicated tests. of course, genome-wide markers should be developed for better genome coverage, so more qtls with high accumulated pve will be detected.

genetic basis of vw resistance
the complexity in mapping qtls for vw resistance in cotton is further illustrated from the meta-analysis of vw resistance qtls reported previously. out of  <dig> qtls reported, except for c <dig> and c <dig> where no qtls for vw resistance were reported, all other chromosomes had qtls mapped, although  <dig> chromosomes carried only 1– <dig> vw qtls. the identification of  <dig> vw resistance qtl hotspots on  <dig> chromosomes further demonstrated the complexity in studying the genetic basis of vw resistance in cotton, because selection of qtls for vw resistance breeding and further genetic and genomic studies will be difficult. however, more attention should be paid to several vw qtl populated hotspots, such as the hotspot with  <dig> vw qtls on c <dig> at 35–60 cm and three hotspots with  <dig> vw qtls on c <dig> at 0–75 cm. but, the most notable is the hotspot with  <dig> vw qtls on c <dig> at 0–25 cm, because this region may also confer resistance to fw and rkn since 1– <dig> resistance qtls to fw and rkn were identified.

several other regions also deserve more attention. the vw qtl hotspot on c <dig> is interesting, because a fw qtl hotspot was within the same region, and a rkn qtl hotspot was also in the proximity. therefore, this region may share genes responsive to vw, fw and rkn.

a region on c <dig> is also very important in conferring resistance to multiple diseases. in a broad region ,  <dig> rkn qtls,  <dig> fw qtls,  <dig> vw qtl, and  <dig> major rn resistance gene  were mapped. another region  with the second most frequent rkn qtls was on c <dig>  in this region, a major gene or qtl was identified for rkn resistance  <cit> . however, this region appeared to confer resistance to only rkn, because there were very few qtls identified for resistance to other diseases.

chromosome c <dig> also deserves more consideration, because it carried two qtl hotspots for vw resistance,  <dig> qtl for rkn resistance and also  <dig> qtls for reniform nematode  resistance. however, the rn resistance qtls were scattered along the chromosome and not contained in any of the hotspots. except for the hotspot in the same region on c <dig> for vw and fw resistance, other hotspots including  <dig> hotspots for rkn resistance did not overlap with any of the resistance qtl hotspots for vw and fw. in fact, the numbers of qtls for vw, fw and rkn on different chromosomes were not correlated . therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the resistance mechanisms for the three diseases are likely different. however, the linked markers for  <dig> vw hotspots,  <dig> fw hotspots and  <dig> rkn hotspots should be highly useful in choosing chromosome regions with consistent qtls for marker-assisted selection and high resolution mapping of resistance qtls and genes.

nbs-coding genes and disease resistance qtls
in rice and other plant species, many disease resistance genes were cloned and isolated  <cit> . it is known that most of the disease resistance genes belong to a super gene family encoding nucleotide-binding site  domains. through resistance gene analog rga-based marker analysis, many rgas in cotton were mapped  <cit> . except that a rga marker was found to be linked to a rkn resistance gene in a study  <cit> , no other studies have associated nbs genes with disease resistance in cotton. based on the current study, the number of disease resistance qtls and qtl clusters including hotspots identified on chromosomes seemed to be positively correlated with the number of nbs genes. however, on several other chromosomes with very few nbs genes, substantially higher numbers of resistance qtls were identified. it is likely that in some qtl cluster and hotspot regions, multiple nbs genes are located, and different nbs genes may confer resistance to different diseases. since nbs-coding r genes are normally major mendelian resistance genes  <cit> , the positive correlation of qtl clusters and hotspots identified in the current meta-analysis with nbs genes indicates that these qtl regions maybe contain major resistance r genes. in fact, major disease resistance genes or qtls with major effects have been identified for vw, fw, rkn, rn, and bb . for example, two major resistance genes were identified for rkn ; and more than  <dig> major genes resistant to various races of bb including one on chromosome  <dig> have been reported  <cit> . others major resistance genes include one resistant to southwestern cotton rust  and two resistant to cotton leaf crumple virus  <cit> . recent studies have shown that some major disease resistance r genes in other plants are co-localized with resistance qtls, suggesting weak or defeated effects of r genes or their tight linkage with other genes responsible for quantitative resistance loci  <cit> . there are other genes with different functions identified recently that may be responsible for quantitative disease resistance  <cit> . further studies are needed to discern the relationship between disease resistance qtls and nbs genes in cotton. because a 25 cm region may contain 700– <dig> genes based on the sequenced diploid cotton genomes, identification of candidate genes for the resistance qtl clusters is currently impractical in this study. in the future, positional candidate gene approaches in relating nbs genes to resistance qtls will be possible once the tetraploid cotton genome is sequenced and the qtl clusters are narrowed to 5–10 cm regions through a high resolution mapping strategy using large genetic populations.

materials and methods
materials
an interspecific backcross inbred line  population comprising of  <dig> lines was used in this study. the bils were developed from a cross between upland cotton  sg  <dig> and g. barbadense giza  <dig> through two generations of backcrossing using sg  <dig> as the recurrent parent followed by four generations of self-pollination. during the bil development, each bc1f <dig> plant was used as male parent to backcross with sg  <dig> to derive bc2f <dig>  in each bc1f1-derived bc2f <dig> progeny, one single representative plant was selected for seed increase and used as the seed source for subsequent field tests. the  <dig> bils and the two parents were planted in the experimental farm of china cotton research institute, chinese academy of agricultural sciences, anyang, henan province in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the fields used to evaluate vw resistance were grown with cotton yearly and heavily infected with race  <dig> of v. dahliae kleb. to further evaluate vw resistance, an artificially inoculated field nursery with the vw strain from anyang was used in  <dig>  the  <dig> entries were arranged in a randomized complete block design with two , three  and four replications . seeds were sown in single row plots in april and crop managements followed local recommendations. the plot length was  <dig>  m with a row-spacing of  <dig>  m and seedlings were thinned to 27– <dig> plants per plot.

vw resistance screening
all the individual plants in each plot were evaluated for vw resistance based on a system established as a national standard for screening cotton for vw resistance in china  <cit> , as the following, <dig>  no symptom 

 <dig>  <25 % chlorotic/necrotic leaves

 <dig>  25–50 % chlorotic/necrotic leaves

 <dig>  50–75 % chlorotic/necrotic leaves

 <dig>  >75 % chlorotic/necrotic leaves

 <dig>  complete defoliation or plant death



the number of infected plants was divided by the total number of plants screened to calculate disease incidence , and average disease severity rating-vwr, i.e., the sum of  was divided by the total number of plants  <cit> . the average disease severity rating on the 0– <dig> scale was converted to the disease index  on a 0–100 % scale as the ratio between the average severity rating and the highest rating .

dna extraction, maker analysis, and map construction
the genomic dnas were extracted from young leaves of the  <dig> individual bil lines and the two parents using a quick method  <cit> . simple sequence repeat markers  were used to construct a genetic map for the bil population using joinmap  <dig>   <cit>  and the linkage map was published elsewhere  <cit> .

qtl mapping
for qtl mapping, the icimapping software , an integrated software for building linkage maps and mapping qtls which can handle various mapping populations including bils in this study, was used  <cit> . see yu et al.  <cit>  for details. the qtl nomenclature followed mccouch et al.  <cit>  in that a qtl designation begins with “q”, followed by an abbreviation of the trait name, year, chromosome name, and finally a serial number.

meta-analysis of qtls
as of the end of january  <dig>  results of disease resistance qtl mapping from all publicly accessible journals were obtained, in addition to a few papers published in chinese in china. this study used  <dig> published papers regarding mapping of resistance to vw, fw, rkn, rn, bacterial blight  and black root rot  with  <dig> qtls reported . for vw resistance qtl mapping,  <dig> studies  were included. for fw qtl mapping,  <dig> studies  were included. for rkn qtl mapping,  <dig> studies  were included. for rn qtl mapping,  <dig> studies were included . to be more inclusive, results from two studies on bb and brr resistance qtl mapping were also used  <cit> .table  <dig> mapping of resistance to verticillium wilt , fusarium wilt , root-knot nematodes  and reniform nematodes  that were identified in this study and reported in other studies

a meta-analysis of qtls for vw resistance was performed using biomercator v <dig> software . briefly, using biomercator v <dig>  the map file and qtl file from each study were loaded into the software in the tab delimited format, and were then mapped to the consensus  map  <cit>  obtained from the cotton marker database  <cit> . since the map file contains distances between markers on each chromosome, each population’s qtls were mapped to the consensus map separately. a detailed description in the meta-analysis of resistance qtls can be found in said et al.  <cit> .

to reduce errors in declaring a qtl, four or more qtls  in an interval of 25 cm were considered a consistent qtl region. if there was more than one trait involved in the qtls, the region is called a qtl cluster. otherwise, it is called a qtl hotspot for the region involving only one single trait.

based on the recent completion of genome sequencing of g. raimondii and g. arboreum , nbs-encoding genes were identified. for example, chromosomes  <dig> through  <dig> of the g. raimondii genome carried  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . a simple correlation analysis was performed between the number of the nbs genes and the number of total qtls and qtls resistant to individual diseases. coefficients of correlation were tested for significance at the degree of freedom of  <dig>  or  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, linkage mapping of verticillium wilt  resistance and meta-analysis of qtls were used to map qtl clusters and hotspots for resistance to vw, fusarium wilt, root-knot nematodes and reniform nematodes in cotton. in a four-year replicated test of a backcross inbred line population for vw resistance,  <dig> resistance qtls were mapped based on a  <dig> cm linkage map with  <dig> ssr markers, which has added useful information to the understanding of the genetic basis of vw resistance in cotton. twenty-eight disease resistance qtl clusters and  <dig> hotspots identified from a total of  <dig> reported qtls in  <dig> papers and linked ssr markers provide important information for marker-assisted selection and high resolution mapping of resistance qtls and genes. the non-overlapping of most resistance qtl hotspots for different diseases indicates that their resistances are controlled by different genes.
