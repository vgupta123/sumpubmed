BACKGROUND
the primary factor affecting ruminal biohydrogenation  is the quality of the animal diet, the composition of which can affect the content of healthy fatty acids  in milk and meat. in particular, the concentrate to forage ratio plays an important role in the accumulation of several bh intermediates, especially if the diet is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids   <cit> . the inclusion of polyphenols in ruminant feeds has an inhibitory effect on the bh of dietary pufa, as consequence of their influence on microbial activity and diversity  <cit> . this has been shown to increase the duodenal flow of bioactive fa, such as vaccenic acid  and, as consequence, improve the nutritional value of milk fat from large and small dairy ruminants because this fa can be ∆9-desaturated to rumenic acid  in the mammary gland and other tissues. however, from the literature it is well known that the availability of va in ruminant products is limited at the rumen level by its hydrogenation to stearic acid  or by the isomerisation to other c18: <dig> isomers by microbial activity taking place in the rumen  <cit> .

the rumen microbial community is comprised of an enormous number of microbial species belonging to the bacteria, archaea and eucarya domains. however, only a limited number of rumen microorganisms have been isolated and physiologically characterised thus far  <cit> . among the different microbial species already identified, those belonging to the butyrivibrio group appear of particular interest because they are known to be directly involved in bh  <cit> . recent studies carried out on different species of ruminants have reported that diets enriched with polyphenols caused a decrease in sa and a simultaneous decline in key species of butyrivibrio  <cit> .

in the mediterranean region, during the period of olive oil production, there is a high production of moist virgin olive pomace that presents a problem for its disposal. the most recent stoning virgin olive pomace techniques result in a residual product  after the mechanical extraction of oil from olives followed by the drying of the cake on a fluid bed dryer. sop is characterised by a high level of polyphenols  and low lignin content, which is considered to be the main factor that reduces the digestibility of olive pomace or olive cake when these by-products are utilised as animal feed  <cit> . these chemical characteristics render sop potentially able to interfere with rumen fermentation  <cit> . however, little information is available in the literature on the effect of the sop inclusion in ruminant diets on microbial strains involved in bh processes. the aim of the present study was to verify whether sop supplementation in the sheep diet is able to affect the overall rumen microbial profile and, in particular, the butyrivibrio group that influences the pufa profile of rumen liquor .

RESULTS
rumen liquor fatty acid composition
during the fermentation of the three feeds, the concentration of acetic acid  did not exhibit significant differences with the exception of 12 h, when the percentage of this volatile fatty acid was higher in rl fermenting s <dig> and s <dig> . moreover, the presence of sop in feeds significantly increased the concentration of propionic , butyric  and isovaleric  acids compared to the content of these fa in rl with c. as consequence, the c2:0/c3: <dig> ratio in s <dig> and s <dig> was significantly lower than that in rl fermented with c at  <dig> and 24 h .table  <dig>

microbial population profiling
dgge analysis of pcr-amplified partial 16s rrna genes was performed on the total bacteria, and butyrivibrio populations of rl incubated with the three diets. microbial profiles obtained using universal primers for bacteria displayed a complex band pattern in all samples . a upgma dendrogram separated samples incubated with s <dig> and s <dig> diets and collected at 24 h from all the other samples, with  <dig> % similarity . within the cluster containing s <dig> and s <dig> and collected at 24 h two subclusters  were evident, based on the percentage of sop . samples collected at  <dig> and 6 h formed a different group when compared with samples collected at 12 h and with control samples collected at 24 h, with a similarity of  <dig> %. a similarity higher than 92% was found in rl samples inoculated with c, s <dig> and s <dig> collected at  <dig> and 6 h . according to the amova of dgge banding patterns, there was a significant effect of sampling time on bacterial communities  and a significant effect of the diet within samples collected at the same time point .figure  <dig>

pcr-dgge analysis of members of the butyrivibrio group exhibited a less complex pattern than the total bacteria . two main clusters were evident, separating all samples collected at  <dig> and 6 h from those collected at  <dig> and 24 h, with  <dig> % similarity . subclusters once again clearly reflected the percentage of the amount of sop added and the collection time . control samples collected at  <dig> and 6 h grouped differently from samples incubated with s <dig> and s <dig> diets , with  <dig> % similarity. moreover, all samples collected at 12 h grouped separately from those collected at 24 h, with  <dig> % similarity . along within the latter group, samples to which the s <dig> and s <dig> diets were added grouped together, separately from control samples, with  <dig> % similarity . amova analysis indicated a significant effect of sampling time on butyrivibrio dgge banding patterns  and of the diet within samples collected at the same time point .

sequence analysis of bacterial and butyrivibrio-specific pcr-dgge bands
pcr-dgge bands exhibiting remarkable changes in response to sop in total bacterial or butyrivibrio populations  were excised, re-amplified and sequenced . moreover, to gain more information on the composition of the rumen bacterial community of sheep, ten bands obtained with primers f968/r <dig> for total bacteria  were selected and sequenced, even if their intensity was not affected by sop . putative taxonomic identification for each band subjected to sequencing is reported in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

phylogenetic analysis of the nineteen sequences of the pcr-dgge fragments obtained with primers f968/r <dig>  and sequences from rumen bacteria of equivalent length retrieved from the genbank database was performed. the results indicated that seven sequences  were related to known species of clostridiales , ten sequences  were related to neisseriales and the remaining two sequences were related to pasteurellales  and aeromonadales  .figure  <dig>

the analysis of total bacterial pcr-dgge profiles evidenced that the intensities of seven bands, corresponding to neisseria weaveri , ruminobacter amylophilus , unclassified pasteurellaceae  and lachnospiraceae  were reduced at 24 h in samples receiving the s <dig> diet in comparison to controls, whereas one band, identified as neisseria flavescens , increased in s <dig> samples at the same sampling time . on the contrary, minor differences were observed in presence of the s <dig> diet at 24 h in comparison to controls because only disappearance of band  <dig>  and the appearance of band  <dig>  were detected .

a phylogenetic tree was also constructed with the five sequences obtained with the butyrivibrio-specific primers f968/bfib and other sequences of equivalent length, representative of bacterial species related to the lachnospiraceae family. as displayed in figure  <dig>  two sequences  grouped with sequences representative of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus, whereas three sequences  displayed a very low level of similarity with other known bacterial species belonging to the lachnospiraceae family.figure  <dig>

pcr-dgge profiles obtained using butyrivibrio-specific primers exhibited weak changes in the butyrivibrio community in relation to diets. in s <dig> and s <dig> samples, the intensities of bands  <dig> and  <dig>  identified as butyrivibrio proteoclasticus, were reduced at 12 h when compared to c . moreover, considering samples collected at 24 h, band  <dig>  , exhibited a lower intensity than the controls after incubation with the s <dig> and s <dig> diets, whereas the intensities of bands  <dig> and  <dig>  decreased only slightly in the presence of s <dig> diet .

discussion
in the literature it is well known that the inclusion of polyphenols in ruminant diets affects rumen metabolism, decreasing dietary protein degradation and fatty acid bh by means of targeting specific groups of microorganisms  <cit> . the in vitro degradability of organic matter, which is strongly related to microbial activity in the fore-stomach, is typically low for olive oil cakes on the basis of their polyphenol content. in fact, when dietary polyphenols are inactivated by using poly ethylene glycol  no detrimental effect has been observed in rumen microorganisms  <cit> . sop contains a high level of polyphenols, and it is hypothesised that this supplement might be useful for improving the content of pufa in products derived from ruminant livestock, at the same time contributing to the environmental sustainability of animal productions  <cit> . however, until now, there has been a lack of knowledge on the effect of sop on lipid metabolism and rumen microbial communities involved in fatty acid bh processes. this information is essential to optimise the employment of sop in ruminant feeding.

our findings indicated that the inclusion of sop in feeds stimulated the production of volatile fatty acids , suggesting that microbial activity was modified by the presence of sop in feeds: the highest increase of c3: <dig> in the fermented rl inoculated with s <dig> and s <dig> can be related with a good level of amylolytic bacteria activity, while the constant production of c2: <dig> and the increase of iso c <dig>  arising from microbial degradation of dietary amino acids, can be an indication of stimulated cellulolytic bacteria activity  <cit> . iso c <dig> is the precursor of iso c <dig> and iso c <dig>  which arise from rumen cellulolytic bacteria metabolism  <cit> . in our experiment, iso c <dig> and iso c <dig> production was stimulated by sop, confirming that cellulolytic activity was not perturbed. the literature contains controversial results regarding the stimulating or depressing effects of olive oil by-products on rumen vfa production  <cit> . in their in vitro study martin et al.  <cit>  reported low levels of vfa when olive cake was fermented with rumen sheep fluid, while yanetz-ruitz et al.  <cit>  obtained values higher than those reported in the former study. these differences are most likely strongly related to the olive variety, different oil extraction procedures used to obtain olive cakes and to the associative effects of the olive by-product with other dietary components.

sop supplementation in feeds did not protect the double bond cis- <dig> from saturation, as demonstrated by the bh of oa and ra, which decreased during the fermentation period. a decrease in the isomerisation of oa to other trans c18: <dig> isomers  <cit>  was hypothesised because no significant variations in the concentrations of these monoenes were detected. the temporary ra accumulation at 12 h in rl fermented with s <dig> and s <dig> can be related to a negative feedback effect caused by va accumulation in these fermenters. this hypothesis can also be extended to conjugated linolenic acid and vaccelenic acid, further precursors of va from α-lna biohydrogenation, which appeared only at the end of fermentation in fermenters containing the highest content of sop. va accumulation in rl fermented with s <dig> and s <dig> is closely related to a decrease in butyrivibrio proteoclasticum growth, as revealed by pcr-dgge analysis. sop did not contribute to the protection of la and α-lna from isomerisation to their cis- <dig> trans- <dig> isomers, indicating that la-isomerase activity is not influenced by sop inclusion in feeds. moreover, the shift of la and α-lna bh toward the trans- <dig> isomer was not enhanced. this trend agrees with several studies that demonstrated polyphenols do not favour the increase in the concentrations of trans- <dig> monoenes, whose synthesis is strongly related to the starch content of the diet  <cit> .

in this study we employed a pcr-dgge approach to evaluate the effect of sop on rumen bacterial and butyrivibrio communities. pcr-dgge provides information on the predominant populations in the community and, using this technique it is possible to detect the sequences of the prevalent bacterial populations without the need for large clone libraries  <cit> . nevertheless, pcr-dgge presents some limitations: a single dgge band may represent several species with identical partial dna sequences  <cit> , or several bands could be generated from a single organism because of multiple, heterogeneous operons  <cit> . however pcr-dgge widely used in microbial ecology investigations.

cluster analysis of pcr-dgge profiles obtained with universal primers for the 16s rrna gene clearly indicated a shift in the total bacterial community in the presence of sop-enriched diets in comparison to controls, as confirmed by amova. buccioni et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that polyphenols, such as tannins, affected the fa composition of the sheep rumen bacterial community, suggesting changes in its composition and/or activity in relation to the bh process. in our study, the effect of sop on rumen bacterial communities appeared to depend on the level of its supplementation in the diet and the incubation time. indeed, after 24 h of incubation with 90 g/kg of sop, some bands in the pcr-dgge profiles exhibited a decreased intensity. thus the changes observed in the pcr-dgge banding patterns may reflect the reduced abundance of the most sensitive species of ruminal bacteria to the antimicrobial action of sop. our observation is in agreement with previous in vitro studies, supporting the idea that polyphenols from different plants can reduce the activity and proliferation of different ruminal microorganisms  <cit> . the inhibitory effect exerted by these compounds has been explained by their ability to form complexes with the bacterial wall and to inactivate many extracellular enzymes  <cit> .

until now few studies have been carried out on sheep rumen microbiota using pcr-dgge analysis followed by sequencing and identification of the dominant bacterial groups. in this study, only eleven pcr-dgge bands obtained from the total bacterial community analysis were highly related to the 16s rrna genes of known species, whereas the other bands corresponded to yet unclassified bacteria. this result is not surprising because the use of different culture-independent methods has demonstrated that the rumen microbiota is more diverse than previously hypothesised by considering the number of cultivated species  <cit> . on the whole, the sequenced bands were related mainly to species belonging to the clostridiaceae family and the genus neisseria. the first taxonomic group includes many cellulolytic and amylolytic species, which are often found in the rumen  <cit> . in contrast, only a gram-negative carbohydrate-fermenting bacterium similar to neisseria has been isolated from sheep rumen  <cit> . however, because members of the neisseriaceae family are mammalian commensals  <cit> , their presence in the rumen is plausible. in the analysed samples, we also detected the presence of ruminobacter amylophilus, a typical rumen bacterium that may occur in reasonably large numbers in high grain or high roughage diets  <cit> .

the most interesting changes in pcr-dgge profiles were observed for the neisseria flavescens, neisseria weaveri, ruminobacter amylophilus species and for members of the lachnospiraceae and pasteurellaceae families at 24 h in rl inoculated with s <dig> diet. previous in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that some members of the lachnospiraceae family, such as butyrivibrio species, are the main known bacteria involved in rumen bh  <cit> . nevertheless, huws et al.  <cit>  have recently suggested that other yet not known bacterial species may play an important role in the bh process, via analysis of the rl of dairy cows using t-rflp and dgge approaches. thus, the findings thus far from studies on pure cultures may not be sufficient to explain the bacterial contribution to rumen bh in vivo, which appears more complex than previously thought. for example, a previous study by hudson et al.  <cit>  has indicated that some bacterial species, such as staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus bovis, have the capacity to hydrate specific cla intermediates, diverting them from the bh pathway. our results strengthen the hypothesis of huws et al.  <cit> , despite the fact that additional investigations carried out with advanced techniques such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics could better clarify the potential role of the different bacterial groups in the fa metabolism of sheep rumen.

previous in vitro experiments have demonstrated that members of the butyrivibrio group are able to biohydrogenate unsaturated fas more rapidly than other species, and that only b. proteoclasticus has been recognised to reduce c18: <dig> to c18: <dig>  <cit> . therefore we performed a butyrivibrio-specific pcr-dgge analysis to investigate the effect of sop supplementation on this taxonomic group in detail, although the butyrivibrio group comprises only a minor part of ruminal bacteria  <cit> . cluster analysis indicated that both diets supplemented with sop affected the composition of the butyrivibrio population. indeed, at both  <dig> and 24 h of incubation we observed a reduced intensity in specific pcr-dgge bands. sequence analysis revealed that two bacterial groups responding negatively to sop after 12 h of incubation were closely related to b. proteoclasticus , which is the only cultivable sa producer. a significant increase in va was only observed in relation to the incubation time in samples to which sop had been added. therefore, we hypothesise that sop is able to decrease the hydrogenation of trans c18: <dig> and trans c18: <dig> intermediates by negatively affecting the growth of b. proteoclasticus or other species of butyrivibrio not identified here. our findings agree with the results obtained by vasta et al.  <cit> , who found a correlation between the reduced abundance of b. proteoclasticus and the simultaneous increase in va in lamb rumen fluid, following the addition of quebracho tannins to the diet. however, the other few studies available in the literature on the effect of plant extracts rich in polyphenols on ruminal microorganisms have presented contrasting results. according to ghaffari et al.  <cit> , phenolic compounds from pistachio by-products used in the diet of sheep did not affect the abundance of b. proteoclasticus in rumen fluid. moreover, extracts from  <dig> australian plants containing polyphenols selectively inhibited b. proteoclasticus, and only some of them affected b. fibrisolves  <cit> . the variable effect of plant extracts on the members of butyrivibrio group could be related to the type of polyphenols they contain and the supplementation level in the diet, as previously suggested  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
supplementation of feeds with sop inhibited the rumen bh of c <dig> unsaturated fas in a dose dependent manner, resulting in a decrease in the sa concentration and in an increase in va. in particular, changes in rumen fatty acid profiles were associated with changes in the bacterial community, including bacteria responsible for the hydrogenation of va to sa.
