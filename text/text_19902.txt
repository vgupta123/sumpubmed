BACKGROUND
population projections and high production costs necessitate research to identify and develop alternative sources of meat and poultry. the guinea fowl  is a provocative poultry alternative due to its superior nutritional value and economic potential  <cit> . over the past decade poultry research has benefited greatly from advances in sequencing technology, with the genome and various transcriptome projects of both the chicken and the turkey being completed. while there are efforts to generate similar data in non-model avian species  <cit> , to date there is very limited genetic information available to aid the effort of bringing gf meat and poultry products into mainstream consumption at a reasonable price  <cit> . the application of transcriptome data generated through rna-sequencing has the potential to provide clues that will increase our understanding of the metabolic regulation of appetite, feed utilization, immune function, growth and overall production performance of guinea fowl.

transcriptome analysis of the guinea fowl will provide fundamental data needed to develop species-specific management tools, such as feed and disease prevention regimens. the coupled selection of metabolic and immune function traits is of the utmost importance, as continual selection for single metabolic or growth traits have had a detrimental effect on immune function in poultry  <cit> . at first glance this may seem a bit surprising because a rapid growth rate is normally associated with good overall health, to include immune function. it has been shown however, that trait selection imposes an energy trade-off within organisms  <cit> . previous studies have investigated the trade-offs between immune function versus reproduction, production traits, and growth in birds, sheep, and insects respectively  <cit> . collectively these studies have shown that immune function as a trait is dynamic, energetically costly and requires optimization in concert with other selected traits. interestingly, van der most et al. found that while the selection for growth was detrimental to immune function, the selection of immune function does not comprise growth performance in poultry  <cit> . these findings open the door for the establishment of high-performance lines of poultry by allowing for the selection of disease resistance and growth simultaneously.

attaining these goals requires a wealth of genetic information and an in-depth understanding of the role played by each gene involved in the regulation of metabolism, satiety, feed utilization, conversion and metabolism, and immune function. de-novo sequencing and transcriptome assembly of the guinea fowl pancreas, hypothalamus, liver, bone marrow and bursa was performed as a first step to developing this required pool of data unique to the gf. such information is essential in revealing new metabolic pathways that may be utilized to improve growth and production performance of both traditional and non-traditional poultry such as chickens and guinea fowl, respectively.

the aim of this study was to  perform targeted de novo assembly of the guinea fowl transcriptome of the pancreas, liver, hypothalamus, spleen, bursa and bone marrow;  to compile a database of functional annotations for the assembled guinea fowl transcriptome;  to perform comparative analysis of the assembled guinea fowl transcriptome using chicken and turkey protein databases;  to identify guinea fowl transcripts with metabolic and immune function.

RESULTS
in this study we set out to develop a transcriptome library that would reveal unique gene sequences to aid the understanding of key and unique metabolic and immune processes in the guinea fowl. application of the data generated in this study will serve to improve the production performance of guinea fowl and other related avian species.

transcriptome assembly
as mentioned above, the original  <dig> million illumina reads  was reduced to approximately  <dig> million reads through trimming and filtering. these remaining reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs . the gc content per contig was 52% for both the pancreas and liver samples and 49% for the hypothalamus and bursa/bone marrow samples.

the average length of the assembled contigs was  <dig> bases with a n <dig> of  <dig> nucleotides. over  <dig>  of these assembled contigs ranged from 200â€“ <dig> base pairs . the large number of short contigs appears to partially be the result of single end sequencing and partially due to the assembly method. while trinity tends to recover more correct transcripts overall than other methods, it also tends to recover a great deal of partial transcript sequences  <cit> .figure  <dig> analysis of contig assembly. contig assembly resulted in  <dig>  contigs with a minimum length of  <dig> bases, a mean length of  <dig> bases and a n <dig> value of  <dig> .



functional annotation
a total of  <dig>  contigs assembled by trinity returned statistically significant  hits after blastp and blastx searches against the swissprot section of uniprot and the entire chicken and turkey proteomes.

the gene ontology terms assigned to the contigs were well distributed between the categories of biological process, cellular component and molecular function, with a mean level of  <dig> . of these,  <dig>  were assigned at least one gene ontology term. in addition  <dig>  were assigned an enzyme annotation . transcripts that had e-values rising above 1e- <dig> were annotated. this transcriptome shotgun assembly project has been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession gbyg <dig>  the version described in this paper is the first version, gbyg <dig> figure  <dig> distribution of go annotation. in total  <dig> annotations across all categories  were assigned to the gf contigs with the mean go level of  <dig> 



gene coverage analysis for the annotated sequences revealed that  <dig>  or  <dig> % of the sequences that yielded hits covered more than 50% of the gene to which they shared homology. a total of  <dig> sequences showed 100% gene coverage. the predicted open reading frames encoded by the sequences analyzed ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bases in length of with the majority falling between  <dig> to  <dig> bases. due to the low coverage of the reads and lack of replicates a differential expression analysis between the individual tissues was not performed. fastannotator identified  <dig>  domains in the query nucleotide sequences with coverage greater than 50% by searching against domain models from the conserved domains database at an expectation value  limit of  <dig>  .

identification of orthologus contigs
forty percent of the contigs were homologous with protein sequences deposited in the blastp database for chicken  and turkey  . go terms were used to mine the trinotate output  and identify contigs annotated with metabolism or immune function. in total  <dig> transcripts with metabolic function and  <dig> with immune function were uncovered .table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
most of the desired traits in farm animals such as body mass, production yield, and disease resistance are quantitative. over the centuries traditional selective breeding of superior individuals has resulted in the marked enhancement of production traits based on phenotypic expression of desirable traits  <cit> . these traditional means of breed improvement through phenotypic selection have led to enhancement of economically important traits in cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry and other livestock  <cit> . one drawback however, is that traditional methods of breeding are limited in their ability to select for traits that are difficult to measure such as fertility, longevity and disease resistance. these traits do not lend themselves to such dramatic improvement through selection alone  <cit> . it is in these areas that transcriptomic data has the most potential for direct and immediate application.

by focusing on those genes that code for proteins related to traits of interest, poultry scientists have gleaned and applied genetic information to increase the production and performance of chicken and other poultry birds. the transcriptomic data set presented in this study contributes to the genomic and proteomic resources available for gf development. these genetic tools will support the progression of molecular approaches to improve the profitability of guinea fowl production. our results show that sixty percent of the contigs were non-homologous with protein sequences deposited in the blastp database for chicken. the continued curation of this putative set of novel gf genes is essential for downstream comparative analysis, expression profiling, functional studies and trait selection across avian species.
