BACKGROUND
bacterial growth requires an appreciable fraction of the acyl chains of the membrane lipids to be in a disordered state <cit> . such disordered states are imparted by fatty acids that act to offset the closely packed ordered arrangement of the lipid bilayer acyl chains imparted by straight-chain saturated acyl chains. in most bacteria the role of introducing acyl chain disorder is fulfilled by unsaturated fatty acids . some bacteria synthesize ufa by desaturation, an oxygen-requiring reaction that introduces the double bond in a single concerted reaction  <cit> . however, as first recognized by bloch and coworkers this is not an option for anaerobically grown bacteria  <cit> . these investigators originally proposed that introduction of the double bond involved a direct dehydration of the 3-hydroxydecanoyl intermediate of fatty acid synthesis to give a cis- <dig> double bond which would be conserved though subsequent cycles of addition of two carbon atoms to give the membrane lipid ufa moieties  <cit> . however, when tested in cell-free extracts of e. coli, the reaction proved to proceed by a more conservative dehydration to give the classical trans-2-decenoyl fatty acid synthetic intermediate followed by isomerization of the trans-2-double bond to the cis- <dig> species  <cit> . this cis double bond was then preserved through successive c <dig> elongation cycles to form the double bond of the mature ufas  <cit> . the dehydration and isomerization reactions were demonstrated by purification of the e. coli faba enzyme  that catalyzed both the dehydration and isomerization reactions  <cit> . ironically, although the pathway was originally proposed based on the patterns of incorporation of short chain radioactive fatty acids into ufas by cultures of clostridium butyricum   <cit> , all of the extant clostridial genomes lack a homologue of faba, the e. coli dehydratase-isomerase studied by bloch and coworkers. indeed, many bacterial genomes do not encode a recognizable faba. this is also true of fabb, the e. coli chain elongation enzyme that channels the metabolic intermediate produced by faba into the mainstream fatty acid synthetic pathway. indeed in the extant genome sequences faba and fabb homologues are encoded only in the genomes of α- and γ-proteobacteria  <cit> . thus far, two solutions that solve the problem of anaerobic ufa synthesis in the absence of faba and fabb have been reported. the first solution was that of streptococcus pneumoniae which introduces a cis double bond into the growing acyl chain using fabm, a trans- <dig> to cis-3-decenoyl-acp isomerase   <cit> . the second solution was that of enterococcus faecalis which uses homologues of fabz and fabf to perform the functions performed by faba and fabb in e. coli  <cit> . e. faecalis encodes two fabz homologues and two fabf homologues . wang and cronan  <cit>  showed that one of these proteins, now called fabn, functioned as a dehydratase/isomerase analogous to faba, whereas the other fabz homologue possessed only dehydratase activity. a similar picture was seen for the fabf proteins, one  performed the fabb function whereas the other functioned only as a fabf  <cit> . however, neither of these scenarios seemed applicable to the clostridia. c. acetobutylicium lacks fabm, faba and fabb and has only a single copy of fabz, although its fatty acid composition is similar to that of e. coli. this bacterium contains three genes that encode putative fabfs, although only one of these seemed likely to be involved in fatty acid synthesis . the most likely fabf homologue candidate was that encoded within a large gene cluster  that encodes what appears to be a complete set of the genes required for saturated fatty acid synthesis. how does c. acetobutylicium make unsaturated fatty acids? one possibility was that the single fabz and fabf homologues could somehow function in both the saturated and unsaturated branches of the fatty acid synthetic pathway. we report that the c. acetobutylicium fabz cannot catalyze isomerization of its trans-2-decenoyl-acp product to the cis- <dig> species either in vitro or when expressed in e. coli. however, the single fabf homologue active in fatty acid synthesis has the functions of both e. coli long chain 3-ketoacyl-acp synthases, fabb and fabf.

RESULTS
only one of the three c. acetobutylicium fabf homologues can functionally replace e. coli fabf in vivo
there are three annotated c. acetobutylicium fabf homologues designated as cac <dig>  cac <dig> and caa <dig>  <cit> . we will temporarily call these genes fabf <dig>  fabf <dig> and fabf <dig>  although our data indicate that only the first of these genes functions in fatty acid synthesis. to test the functions of these homologues, the three genes were inserted into the arabinose-inducible vector pbad <dig>  the resulting plasmids were then introduced into two e. coli fabb fabf strains, cy <dig> and jwc <dig>  at the non-permissive temperature these mutant strains lack both long chain 3-ketoacyl-acp synthase activities and thus are unable to grow even when the medium is supplemented with the unsaturated fatty acid, oleate  <cit> . derivatives of strains cy <dig> or jwc <dig> carrying phw <dig> encoding fabf <dig> grew at 42°c in the presence of oleate whereas the strains carrying phw <dig> and phw <dig>  failed to grow  . thus, only fabf <dig> complemented the e. coli fabf mutation showing that c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig>  like e. coli fabf, is able to catalyze all of the elongation reactions required in the synthesis of saturated fatty acids. furthermore, expression of fabf <dig> restored thermal control of fatty acid composition to a fabf null mutant strain . an e. coli fabf strain in which c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig> was expressed from the lac promoter of a low copy number vector closely mimicked the changes in fatty acid composition seen in wild type e. coli strains upon changes in growth temperature  <cit> . expression of fabf <dig> restored cis-vaccenate synthesis at all temperatures, but was much more effective at 30°c than at 37°c or 42°c . this effect seems likely to be due to the effects of temperature on fabf <dig> synthase activity since thermal regulation disappeared upon expression of fabf <dig> from a high copy number vector  and the enzyme was thermolabile in vitro . apparently, at high growth temperatures low levels fabf <dig> elongation activity was overcome by high-level expression of the protein. we also found high levels of cis-vaccenate at the non-permissive temperature upon expression of fabf <dig> in an e. coli fabb fabf strain that carried the fabb gene of haemophilus influenzae, a bacterium naturally defective in both cis-vaccenate synthesis and in regulation of fatty acid composition by temperature  <cit>  .

the c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig> gene can functionally replace e. coli fabb
although the presence of plasmid phw <dig>  allowed growth of the two e. coli fabb fabf strains at the non-permissive temperature, growth of both strains required oleate. the lack of growth in the absence of oleate argued that either fabf <dig> lacked the ability to replace fabb or that fabf <dig> was unable to simultaneously perform the tasks of both fabb and fabf under these conditions. to decide between these alternatives we transformed phw <dig> into strain k <dig>  a strain that carries an unconditional fabb allele, and into strain cy <dig> which carries the same fabb allele as strain cy <dig>  the complementation experiments showed that c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig> allowed strain k <dig> to grow on rb medium lacking oleate at 37°c . however, fabf <dig> failed to complement growth of the temperature sensitive fabb mutant strain, cy <dig> at 42°c . if fabf <dig> possessed fabb activity at 37°c, unsaturated fatty acids should be synthesized. to test this hypothesis, we grew strain k <dig> carrying phw <dig> or phw <dig>  at different temperatures and the fatty acid compositions of these strains were determined by collision induced dissociation electrospray mass spectroscopy  . the strains clearly synthesized unsaturated fatty acids when grown at all of the different temperatures. however, the level of unsaturated fatty acids synthesized was lower than that seen in k <dig> carrying a plasmid  that encoded e. coli fabb and the amount of cis-vaccenate decreased with increased growth temperature. moreover, despite the differing copy numbers, the two plasmids that encoded c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig> gave similar levels of unsaturated fatty acids. these results provide an explanation for lack of complementation of the fabb phenotype at 42°c by the fabf1-encoding plasmids. at 42°c the low activity of fabf <dig> did not allow enough unsaturated fatty acid synthesis to support growth. to test whether or not c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig> has fabb function at 42°c we assayed unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in strain cy <dig> carrying the fabf <dig> plasmid phw <dig>  . under these conditions  acetate labeling showed low levels of unsaturated fatty acids synthesis upon arabinose induction of fabf <dig> expression . therefore, fabf <dig> has the ability to replace fabb in e. coli unsaturated fatty acid synthesis but its expression allows growth only when the host fabf is present to perform the bulk of the chain elongation reactions.

functional analysis of c. acetobutylicium fabz in vivo
the sole fabz homologue in the c. acetobutylicium genome is located within a large cluster of putative fab genes  <cit> . to test function of the encoded protein the fabz gene was inserted into the arabinose-inducible pbad <dig> expression vector to give plasmid phw <dig>  since e. coli fabz null strains are nonviable  <cit> , we first introduced phw <dig> into strain dy <dig>  a "recombineering" strain  <cit> . we then expressed the c. acetobutylicium fabz in this strain and used standard phage γ recombinase manipulations to delete the host fabz gene. these manipulations gave strain hw <dig>  which grew well in presence of arabinose but failed to grow in the presence of fucose, an anti-inducer of arabinose promoter expression . the fatty acid composition of the complemented mutant strain grown in presence of arabinose was similar to that of the parental strain, dy <dig>  indicating that c. acetobutylicium fabz functionally replaced e. coli fabz . the lack of faba and fabm homologues in c. acetobutylicium raised the possibility that the fabz of this organism might function as both an isomerase and a dehydratase as does the e. faecalis fabz-like protein, fabn  <cit> . to test this possibility plasmid phw <dig> was introduced into both the faba e. coli strain cy <dig> and the faba null mutant strain mh <dig>  neither stain grew in the absence of unsaturated fatty acid supplementation  indicating that c. acetobutylicium fabz lacks isomerase function and thus was unable to functionally replace faba. however, it remained possible that c. acetobutylicium fabz catalyzed ufa synthesis, but that the levels of ufa produced were too low to support growth. this possibility was tested by -acetate labeling of the fatty acids synthesized by strain cy <dig> carrying phw <dig> and analysis of the resulting radioactive fatty acids for traces of ufa . no ufa synthesis was detected. another possible explanation for the observed lack of ufa synthesis was that fabi, the enoyl-acp reductase of e. coli, converted the intermediate trans-2-decenoyl-acp to decanoyl-acp before the putative isomerase activity of c. acetobutylicium fabz could act. thus, we repeated the labeling experiment in the presence of a low dose of triclosan, a specific e. coli fabi inhibitor  <cit> , in order to give the putative isomerase a better opportunity to act on the trans-2-decenoyl-acp intermediate. again no synthesis of unsaturated fatty acid was observed . these in vivo results argued strongly that that c. acetobutylicium fabz was unable to isomerize trans-2-decenoyl-acp.

in vitro assay of c. acetobutylicium fabz and fabf <dig> activities
to allow direct assay of c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig> and fabz activities we expressed the proteins in e. coli to facilitate their purification. methionine labeling showed that strain bl <dig>  carrying plasmids encoding either c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig> or fabz under control of a phage t <dig> promoter expressed proteins of the expected sizes . however, the expression level of the fabz protein was so low that it was not detected upon staining the sds gels . we attributed this poor expression to the fact that the c. acetobutylicium fabz gene contains  <dig> codons that correspond to nonabundant  trna species in e. coli. we therefore changed these codons to synonymous codons that correspond to abundant e. coli trna species thereby resulting in a modified gene we call fabzm. plasmid phw74m  abundantly expressed a protein with an apparent mass of  <dig> kda  in good agreement with the expected value for the his6-tagged protein . the his6-tagged fabz protein was purified to essential homogeneity using nickel-chelate chromatography . we also purified the n-terminally his6-tagged versions of c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig> and the e. coli fatty acid biosynthetic proteins fabd, fabg, faba, fabz, fabb and fabi plus the vibrio harveyi aass acyl-acp synthetase  <cit>  by nickel-chelate chromatography. aass was used to synthesize the 3-hydroxydecanoyl-acp substrate whereas the other enzymes were used to assemble a defined in vitro fatty acid synthesis system in which the activities of e. coli faba and c. acetobutylicium fabz or e. coli fabb and c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig> could be directly compared. in reactions containing faba 3-hydroxydecanoyl-acp was converted to a mixture of trans- <dig> and cis-3-decenoyl-acps as expected from prior work  <cit> . e. coli fabb is unable to elongate trans-2-decenoyl-acp, but elongates the cis- <dig> species to 3-keto-cis-5-dodecenoyl-acp in the presence of malonyl-acp  <cit> . this product is then reduced by fabg and dehydrated by faba to form trans-2-cis-5-dodecadienoyl-acp <cit> . the trans-2-cis-5-dodecadienoyl-acp product accumulates because the reaction mixtures lacked enoyl-acp reductase which precluded further elongations  <cit> . using this system we showed  that faba is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes both the dehydration of 3-hydroxydecanoyl-acp and well as the reversible isomerization of trans-2-decenoyl-acp to cis-3- decenoyl-acp . as expected e. coli fabz converted 3-hydroxydecanoyl-acp to trans-2-decenoyl-acp. however, addition of e. coli fabb to this reaction failed to give the 12-carbon unsaturated elongation product seen with faba  in agreement with prior reports that e. coli fabz acts solely as a dehydratase and that fabb is unable to elongate trans-2-decenoyl-acp  <cit> . if c. acetobutylicium fabz was capable of the isomerization reaction, then upon addition of e. coli fabb the reaction would yield trans- <dig>  cis-5-dodecadienoyl-acp  <cit> . however, the only product formed was trans-2-decenoyl-acp, the product of e. coli fabz . hence, we conclude that c. acetobutylicium fabz possesses only dehydratase activity and introduction of the cis double bond requires another enzyme that has yet to be discovered. in parallel experiments, we replaced e. coli fabb with c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig> in the e. coli faba reaction mixture to test if c. acetobutylicium fabf <dig> could elongate cis-3-decenoyl-acp . we found that addition of fabf <dig> gave a modest conversion of cis-3-decenoyl-acp to trans-2-cis-5-dodecadienoyl-acp and at 37°c the product yields were lower than those seen at 25°c and 30°c consistent with the low activity of fabf <dig> at high temperature seen in vivo .

discussion
although c. acetobutylicium, c. beijerinckii and e. coli synthesize the same species of unsaturated fatty acids  <cit>  and clostridia are thought to follow the same synthetic mechanism as e. coli  <cit> , the enzyme that introduces the cis double bond of the unsaturated fatty acids remains unknown. like other clostridia the c.acetobutylicium genome encodes none of the three known anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid synthesis pathways denoted by the presence of genes encoding fabm, faba or fabn proteins. one possibility was that the single fabz of this bacterium could somehow partition acyl chains between the saturated and unsaturated branches of the pathway. however, our in vivo and in vitro data show that c. acetobutylicium fabz cannot synthesize the first intermediate in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. hence, clostridia must contain a novel enzyme that introduces the cis double bond. note that the proposed isomerase activity of the c. acetobutylicium fabz was not unreasonable. c. acetobutylicium fabz shares  <dig>  and  <dig> % identical residues with e. faecalis fabn and fabz, respectively, and there is no sequence signature that denotes isomerase ability  <cit> . this is because the isomerase potential of 3-hydroxyacyl-acp dehydratases is not determined by the catalytic machinery at the active site but rather by the β-sheets that dictate the orientation of the central α-helix and thus the shape of the substrate binding tunnel  <cit> . we are currently seeking the gene that encode the enzyme responsible for cis double bond introduction in c. acetobutylicium.

in contrast to fabz, the single 3-ketoacyl-acp synthase  of this bacterium performs the elongation functions required in both branches of the fatty acid synthetic pathway. this protein can both elongate palmitoleoyl-acp to cis-vaccenoyl-acp as does fabf in e. coli and also elongates the cis double bond containing product of faba as does e. coli fabb. however, c. acetobutylicium fabf, was unable to perform the two tasks simultaneously and thus differs from enterococcus faecalis fabo  <cit> . although the c. acetobutylicium fabf and e. faecalis fabo proteins are 45–46% identical to e. coli fabf, they are only 55% identical to one another. hence, each of the three proteins is distinct from the other two. the finding that c. acetobutylicium fabf was unable to perform the two tasks simultaneously could be due to the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of fabf <dig> and to the enzyme undergoing a type of kinetic confusion in this unnatural setting. perhaps the intermediates of one branch of the pathway act  as inhibitors of the other branch. in this scenario the presence of the e. coli enzyme  would result in the inhibitory intermediates being converted to long chain acyl chains, thereby freeing the c. acetobutylicium fabf to operate in the other branch. the complex task faced by fabf <dig> upon expression in an e. coli strain lacking both fabb and fabf is illustrated by the effects of overproduction of faba and fabb in e. coli  <cit> . overproduction of faba results in increased production of saturated fatty acids rather than the increase in unsaturated fatty acid levels that might have been expected  <cit> . in contrast overproduction of fabb has the opposite result; unsaturated fatty acid levels are increased  <cit> . however, if the two enzymes are simultaneously overproduced, the fatty acid composition returns to normal  <cit> . these counter-intuitive results are due to the fact that faba catalyzes reversible reactions whereas the fabb reaction is irreversible. hence, when fabb activity is limiting, any excess cis-3-decenoyl-acp produced by faba can be isomerized back to trans-2-decenoyl-acp and upon fabi action, this acyl chain can enter the saturated arm of the pathway. however, when fabb is in excess, it catalyzes the irreversible elongation of cis-3-decenoyl-acp and thereby pulls the flow of carbon toward the unsaturated branch of the pathway. thus, it would seem a surprising finding if the c. acetobutylicium fabf was able to accurately partition acyl chains between the two branches of the fatty acid synthetic pathway of a foreign organism.

it should be noted that it was not unexpected that the fabf homologue encoded within the fab gene cluster was the only fabf homologue that functioned in fatty acid synthesis. there are good arguments against the other two homologues having this function. the cac <dig> orf in located within a cluster of genes that appear involved in synthesis of a glycosylated product of a hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal polypeptide pathway. if so, the cac <dig> orf would be involved in synthesis of the polyketide moiety. the caa <dig> orf is encoded on the c. acetobutylicium megaplasmid required for the late steps of solvent production by this organism. c. acetobutylicium survives loss of the megaplasmid  <cit>  and therefore the caa <dig> orf cannot encode an enzyme essential for fatty acid synthesis . note that it has been recently reported that the single fabf protein of the distantly related gram positive bacterium lactococcus lactis can also perform the fabb reaction as well as that of fabf <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in clostridia cannot be explained by a plenipotent fabz indicating that these bacteria encode a novel enzyme that introduces the cis double bond. in contrast the clostridia fabf protein has the functions of both of the long chain 3-ketroacyl-acp syntheases of e. coli. the diversity of bacterial enzymes used for synthesis of the cis double bond of unsaturated fatty acids is unexpected because the remainder of the fatty acid synthetic enzymes is well conserved among very diverse bacteria.
