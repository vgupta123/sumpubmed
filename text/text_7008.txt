BACKGROUND
systemic virus infection in plants relies on complex molecular interactions between the invading virus and the host plant  <cit> . through such interactions, the virus recruits diverse host gene products  and metabolites for the translation and replication of its genome, which disrupts the normal biological processes of the host  <cit> . on the other hand, the expression of resistance genes in the infected host is also triggered by specific molecular interactions to combat the infection. thus, virus infection induces the activation and suppression of global gene expressions in the host  <cit> . these gene expression changes are the molecular basis of general stress and defence-like responses, viral pathogenesis and host symptom development.

plum pox virus  is a member of potyviruses, and is considered the most devastating viral pathogen of many stone-fruit species such as prunus persica, p. persica var. nucipersica, and p. domestica  <cit> . despite numerous extensive screenings for genetic resistance against the virus, no natural resistant germplams are currently available for conventional breeding programs. very little is known about the effects of ppv on host cells at the molecular level. a better understanding of molecular ppv-plant interactions would help identify key host factors required for ppv infection and assist in the development of novel recessive resistance to ppv  <cit> .

to date, a major problem in dissecting molecular virus-host interactions is the progressive and asynchronous nature of the infection in leaves or in whole plants  <cit> . in systemically infected plants, some cells may be infected earlier, while others may be infected later. some parts may have higher virus titres while others may have fewer viruses or even virus-free. in the whole plant, it may take from days to weeks for the invading virus to spread from the infection site and develop systemic symptoms in the intact plant. thus, the infected tissues contain cells at various infection stages or with viral concentrations in a wide range. as a result, temporal and spatial expression changes of host genes are very difficult to investigate. in the absence of a synchronous virus infection system and a global gene expression profiling technology, maule and colleagues elegantly assessed the expression of selected host genes in individual cells across an advancing infection front using a cell biological approach    <cit> . to date, microarray technology has been adapted to profile genome-wide gene expression changes in plants in response to infections of a number of positive sense rna viruses  <cit> . more recently, yang et al.  <cit>  creatively dissected infection foci away from the non-infected tissue into four distinct zones using an infectious clone of turnip mosaic virus  tagged with green fluorescence protein   and profiled global gene expression changes in each of these zones with microarray, making it possible to spatially and temporally correlate virus infection and accumulation with host gene expression. collectively these works largely advance our understanding of virus-host interactions.

considering the availability of whole genome microarrays, and increasing use of genetic and biochemical approaches in archetypal plants like arabidopsis thaliana to explore the molecular interactions between viruses and their host plants  <cit> , we used an arabidopsis ath <dig> affymetrix array and analyzed global gene expression changes in arabidopsis leaves infected with ppv at  <dig> days post inoculation . further, we generated arabidopsis synchronized single-cell protoplasts, transfected with a ppv infectious clone and assayed global gene expression changes in the protoplasts at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hr post transfection . the aim of this study was to investigate general gene expression changes in infected leaf tissues and their association with ppv infection and symptom development, and to identify putative host gene factors differentially regulated upon ppv infection, particularly those at early time points involved in defence and viral pathogenesis.

RESULTS
symptom development in ppv-infected arabidopsis plants
susceptibility of arabidopsis accession col- <dig> to the infection of a ppv-d strain isolated in canada was monitored by recording the development of symptoms and the virus titre. no typical viral symptoms such as mosaic, chlorosis, ringspot, vein yellowing, or leaf curling were visible in plants inoculated with ppv at  <dig> dpi and up to  <dig> dpi. this is consistent with the recent finding that arabidopsis plants infected by two ppv-d isolates displayed mild or no symptoms  <cit> . at  <dig> dpi, the most obvious phenotypes observed in this study were mild growth retardation, slightly delayed flowering and bolting . these phenotypes were not documented for arabidopsis accession col- <dig> infected with two ppv-d isolates but were very similar to accession bay-o inoculated with one of the two ppv-d isolates  <cit> . considering the diverse phenotypes of different accession-isolate combinations, the observed phenotypic variation between the two studies is likely due to the ppv isolates used. using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , ppv was detected in newly developed rosette leaves above the inoculated leaves  at  <dig> dpi. since ppv-induced symptoms appeared and the virus was detected by rt-pcr and elisa at  <dig> dpi in the infected leaf tissues, it was expected that changes in host gene expression would be altered at this time point. in addition, we also inoculated nicotiana benthamiana plants with ppv. infected leaves showed chlorosis and severe mosaic symptoms as early as  <dig> dpi . at  <dig> dpi, the virus titre in n. benthamiana was at least  <dig> times or higher than that in arabidopsis , suggesting that arabidopsis may have stronger basal or inducible resistance to ppv than n. benthamiana.

over- or under-represented functional categories of differentially expressed arabidopsis genes in ppv-infected leaf tissues
at  <dig> dpi, newly expanded ppv-infected rosette leaves from the inoculated plants and the corresponding leaves from the mock-inoculated plants were sampled for microarray hybridizations. consistency of the microarray data was assessed by comparing the mean normalized signal intensities obtained from the mock-inoculated control samples across three independent biological replicates. a high correlation  among the mock inoculated control samples was observed, indicating low biological variability between the replicates.

gene expression data were analyzed by one-way anova to identify differentially expressed genes in ppv-infected rosette leaves from the inoculated plants relative to leaves from the mock-inoculated plants. using stringent selection criteria with the benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate  of 5%  <cit> , corresponding to q ≤  <dig>   <cit> , ~ <dig> % of the non-redundant  genes  were identified as significantly differentially expressed  in response to ppv infection. these  <dig>  genes were further filtered using a  <dig> -fold increase or decrease in signal intensity. using this fold change cut-off, we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  arabidopsis genes that were significantly induced and repressed by ppv in systemically infected tissues, respectively.

each identified gene was then assigned to a functional class according to the arabidopsis mips  functional classification scheme . with the information gathered from tair  database , we were able to assign a putative function for  <dig> % of the total  <dig>  genes on the array, while the remaining  <dig> % were undefined as they were annotated as "unknowns or orphans" . the expression levels of arabidopsis genes significantly induced or repressed by ppv were assigned to  <dig> different major functional groups. in some major functional groups, genes were further separated into subcategories to simplify the data for biological interpretation . the number of genes in each functional category was subjected to fisher's exact test  <cit>  to determine if genes involved in certain biological processes were over- or under-represented . the functional groups significantly over-represented in the set of upregulated genes were carbohydrate/soluble sugar/starch/amino acid metabolism , primary and secondary metabolism , intracellular membrane/membrane-bound organelle , clathrin binding , glycolysis , protein folding/heat shock/chaperone activity , cell wall-associated transcripts , rna metabolism , chloroplast , protein fate , ubiquitin-like conjugating enzyme activity  and development/storage proteins . among the downregulated genes, the over-represented functional groups were metal ion binding/metal binding , development/storage proteins , cell wall-associated transcripts  and protein synthesis and translation . genes involved in primary/secondary metabolism  and intracellular membrane/membrane-bound organelle  functional groups were significantly under-represented.

a number of genes in a given category represented on the chip.

b percentage was calculated based on the number of differentially regulated genes divided by the total number of genes in the functional category on the chip.

the analysis showed that that the number of upregulated genes was more than that of downregulated genes in ppv-infected arabidopsis leaves, probably reflecting more diverse genes induced by ppv infection. this notion is supported by a disproportionate allocation in the number of altered genes in the infected leaf tissues belonging to major functional groups of metabolism, transcription/splicing/rna processing proteins, defence and development/storage proteins.

gene expression changes in metabolism, chloroplast and protein fate in ppv-infected arabidopsis leaf tissues likely involved in symptom development
virus infections often disturb the general metabolism in the host. this includes the accumulation of soluble sugars  and starch , an increase in the rate of respiration, a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis and elevated levels of amino acid synthesis   <cit> . in this study, we found that in ppv-infected leaves, 23%  of genes associated with metabolism of starch, soluble sugars and amino acids and  <dig> %  of genes related to glycolysis showed elevated expression levels . appearance of disease symptoms such as chlorosis on the cucumber mosaic virus -infected leaf tissues in cucumber was correlated with increased glycolysis, phosphoenol pyruvate phosphate, respiration and starch accumulation, decreased photosynthesis and reduction in total protein synthesis  <cit> . the increased expression of these genes may result from the physical blockage of the transport path, the inactivation of sugar transport proteins or the induction of cell wall invertase  <cit> . indeed, several cell wall invertase genes were also induced in ppv-infected leaves in this study. these data indicate that a series of intercrossing pathways involved in sugar metabolism was differentially regulated by ppv infection. it is possible that altered gene expression pathways involved in sugar metabolism might contribute to the mild symptom development observed in ppv-infected arabidopsis leaves.

in addition to soluble sugars, starch and amino acids, ppv also induced 16%  of membrane-associated proteins, including proteins associated with integral membrane, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum , vacuole, mitochondria and peroxisomes . recently, membrane proteins have also been found to be upregulated in n. benthamiana plants infected with tomato ringspot virus  and ppv  <cit> . for example, genes encoding proteins such as plasma membrane polypeptide, putative integral membrane, cop-coated vesicle membrane, clathrin protein and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase were induced in ppv-infected arabidopsis leaves that have similar functional identity to those upregulated in n. benthamiana plants infected with torsv and ppv. it is believed that many positive-strand rna viruses replicate their genome in association with cellular membranes. viral proteins that are required for the formation of viral replication complexes  are often shown to be located in er  <cit> . it would be interesting to investigate whether these upregulated membrane proteins are co-localized to vrcs. characterization of such host membrane factors will provide useful information regarding molecular mechanisms governing membrane specificity for viral rna replication.

of the upregulated genes coding for nuclear or cytosolic proteins in ppv-infected arabidopsis leaves, two ogts , named sec  and spy , which can potentially posttranslationally modify the viral capsid protein , are very interesting. study by chen et al.  <cit>  has shown that the n-terminus of the cp of ppv is modified with o-linked n-acetyl glucosamine in n. clevelandii, n. benthamiana and arabidopsis, indicating that the modifications are not host specific. in arabidopsis, this modification is catalyzed by sec but not by spy. such modification is not essential but plays a role in the infection process  <cit> . sec and spy have partial functional redundancy in plants  <cit> . it is not clear whether the upregulation of spy in ppv-infected arabidopsis is a compensation for the loss of sec that is used for the modification of the ppv cp.

we also observed as many as  <dig> chloroplast genes that were upregulated in ppv-infected leaf tissues . these represent approximately 60% of the chloroplast genes in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . several studies suggest that differential regulation of chloroplast gene expression is correlated to viral symptoms such as mosaic and chlorosis  <cit> . recently, dardick  <cit>  has reported that torsv or ppv infection in n. benthamiana leaves induces severe mosaic and chlorosis symptoms. however, the infection of this host with prunus necrotic ringspot virus  hardly induces any symptoms. using potato cdna chips, it has been shown that infections of torsv and ppv result in the suppression of 34%  of chloroplast-related genes, while no common genes are among the induced genes in torsv- and ppv-infected n. benthamiana. in contrast to other two viruses, pnrsv infection downregulates 67%  and upregulates 33%  of the chloroplast-related genes  <cit> . analogous to pnrsv-infected n. benthamiana, ppv-infected arabidopsis leaves did not show typical viral symptoms such as mosaic and chlorosis. the induction of such a large number of chloroplast-related genes in arabidopsis may help maintain the normal function and morphology of the infected leaf and counteract possible detrimental effects resulting from ppv infection.

in virus infected plants, protein activities are often altered through posttranslational modifications such as ubiquitination  <cit> . in the current study, about 9%  of the upregulated protein fate genes encoding proteins associated with the 26s proteasome were very significant  and over-represented . of the seven upregulated 26s proteasome genes, two genes code for aaa-atpase subunits including rpt <dig> that reside in the mature 26s proteasome  <cit>  and five genes including rpn <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are involved in ubiquitination. fundamentally, the 26s proteasome is known to control many biochemical processes by programmed degradation of regulatory protein targets  <cit> . upregulation of these genes may interfere with ubiquitin-dependent reactions in plants  <cit> . it has been reported that, the 26s proteasome degrades the virus-encoded movement protein that facilitates the viral cell-to-cell spread  <cit> . therefore, the upregulation of the 26s proteasome genes may be a resistance response to ppv infection.

on the other hand, in n. benthamiana plants infected with torsv, about 72%  of the proteasome genes have been shown to be upregulated  <cit> . a few archetype proteasome proteins such as subtilisin-like protease, aspartyl protease, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, f-box protein and 26s proteasome regulatory subunits induced by ppv in arabidopsis leaves are upregulated by torsv in n. benthamiana plants  <cit> . upregulation of such protein fate and ubiquitin genes has also been observed in other studies during viral infection  <cit> . study by marathe et al.  <cit>  has demonstrated that the induction of f-box proteins may mediate the degradation components of the cmv-y resistance pathway. though the above mentioned protease genes induced by ppv infection are known to function in the protein degradation, plant defence responses and hypersensitive reactions  <cit> , their exact roles in ppv infection are to be elucidated.

association of the repression of development/storage proteins, protein synthesis and cell wall-related genes in arabidopsis leaf tissues with ppv infection and symptom development
many virus-induced symptoms have been linked to alterations in plant hormone synthesis  <cit> . of the  <dig> development/storage genes identified in this study,  <dig> auxin,  <dig> ethylene and  <dig> gibberellin-related genes were repressed in ppv-infected leaves . recent studies  <cit>  on tmv infection in arabidopsis have shown that during the process of infection the tmv replicase protein interacts with a subset of aux/iaa proteins, resulting in the activation of auxin responsive transcription factors . such an alteration in the transcription levels of auxin-responsive genes and the disruption of host normal physiological process have shown to be associated with disease symptoms. in this study, ppv infection suppressed the expression of two such genes encoding auxin iaa proteins . with respect to the downregulation of ethylene responsive genes, though there is no direct evidence suggesting interactions between virus and ethylene signalling components, specific viral proteins have been suggested to alter the ethylene signalling pathway  <cit> . for instance, the p <dig> protein of cauliflower mosaic virus  is associated with the disruption of the ethylene response pathway and this may play a key role in the induction of symptoms such as mild vein chlorosis to severe chlorosis and stunting  <cit> . in the case of downregulation of gibberellic acid , a direct interaction between the rice dwarf virus  p <dig> protein and the rice ent-kaurene oxidase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of ga in plants was found to be responsible for the significant reduction of ga <dig> in rdv-infected plants, and in the appearance of dwarf phenotype  <cit> . collectively these examples demonstrate that the suppression of hormone-related genes by viruses induces symptoms through altering the host hormone and developmental signalling pathway. it would be interesting to know whether any of the observed downregulated hormone-related genes is associated with the reduced growth and delayed development of ppv-infected arabidopsis.

another significantly over-represented subset of genes suppressed in ppv-infected tissues includes genes coding for the protein synthesis and translation machinery . this functional category contains  <dig> ribosomal subunits:  <dig> large,  <dig> small and  <dig> plastid specific ribosomal proteins. in the arabidopsis genome, there are ~ <dig> ribosomal genes  <cit> . about 15% of these ribosomal genes were printed on the array. based on the analysis, we observed that approximately 81%  of the small and large ribosomal subunit genes were significantly repressed in ppv-infected leaves.

however, an opposite trend was observed in ppv-infected n. benthamiana plants  <cit> , where 80%  of potato ribosomal genes were upregulated. comparison of these potato upregulated ribosomal genes in arabidopsis through blast  sequence similarity searches identified  <dig> nuclear ribosomal subunits  <cit> . comparative analysis of  <dig> arabidopsis nuclear ribosomal subunits that were downregulated by ppv in our study with those in dardick's study  showed  <dig>  arabidopsis ribosomal subunits with an opposing trend. since plant viruses lack protein synthesis ability, they rely on the host cell translation machinery to produce viral proteins. thus, ppv might benefit from the upregulation of ribosomal genes in n. benthamiana which showed more susceptibility to ppv and displayed much more severe symptoms than arabidopsis. however, at present there is no evidence to discern whether the observed downregulation of ribosomal genes is due to the stronger basal resistance of arabidopsis to ppv infection or due to the natural intricacy of the different host responses to ppv that are diverse depending on the tissue type, time post infection, temperature, host and virus strain, or simply due to an artifact of hybridizations, given that two different platforms were used in the studies.

cell wall-related genes are major determinants of cell morphogenesis in plants, encoding several hundreds of different structural proteins and cell wall-related enzymes  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> cell wall-related genes encoding protein for structure , reassembly , expansins  and matrix polymers  were significantly downregulated in ppv-infected leaves . this is consistent with results observed in arabidopsis plants infected by tumv  <cit>  and in rice plants infected with rdv  <cit> . in these studies, repression of cell wall related genes is correlated with symptom development. of these downregulated genes, extensin is a cell wall-localized hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein that usually forms a cross-linked network with pectin to create a highly impassable barrier against pathogens  <cit> . downregulation of extensin during ppv infection suggests a decreased extensin deposition  <cit> . conceivably, ppv exploits the plasmodesmata to move from initially infected cells to the neighbouring healthy cells. it is not likely that ppv cell-to-cell movement is related to the deposition of extensin. nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms and the biological connotation underlying the downregulation of cell wall-related genes in the infected leaf remain to be understood.

in addition to the above described genes, many genes in the category of metal ion binding or metal binding were also downregulated. it is not clear if the downregulation of these genes can lead to physiological changes that are associated with ppv infection.

identification of genes differentially regulated by ppv in infected arabidopsis protoplasts
resistance induced through signal transduction pathways in arabidopsis may take place immediately after ppv infection. the arabidopsis leaves infected with ppv at  <dig> dpi contained a mixture of uninfected, infected, and post-infected cells. thus, the spatial and temporal information on gene expression was lost. sampling at earlier time points such as  <dig> or  <dig> dpi can reduce the percentage of post-infected cells but will largely increase the percentage of non-infected cells. so, protoplasts have been suggested to overcome this barrier  <cit> . there are several advantages in using arabidopsis protoplasts to study plant-virus interactions. first, in contrary to unpredictable infections on the leaf, synchronized protoplast cells allows for a more precise determination of gene expression. second, a much higher proportion of the cells are infected than that in infected leaf tissues  <cit> . for example, we have shown that in arabidopsis protoplasts transfected with plasmid pppv-sk <dig>  a ppv infectious clone, the transfection efficiency is approximately 35%  <cit> . hence, the protoplast system makes it possible to study molecular events as early as just a few hours post infection. like other experimental systems, the protoplast system also has some limitations. protoplasts lack the cell wall so the physiological integrity of the plant organ is disrupted. during isolation, transfection and culture of protoplasts, gene expression changes induced by harsh treatments such as osmotic stress, enzymatic digestion and centrifugation may mask those induced by virus infection  <cit> . physiological milieu that a virus encounters in protoplast cells might be quite different from that of an intact leaf cell. sample bias may result from the minute amounts of rna isolated from the protoplasts and from the subsequent amplification step. however, improved technologies and experimental designs may be used to minimize the negative impact of the system  <cit> . recently, we reported a protocol describing the isolation and transfection of arabidopsis protoplasts for studying ppv-host interactions  <cit> . in order to identify early time points for profiling global gene expression changes in infected protoplast cells, a time course experiment was performed. arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with a ppv infectious cdna clone, pppv-sk <dig> derived from an m strain and with a non-infectious deletion mutant, pppv-sk68Δ as control, respectively  <cit> . in the mutant clone, the deletion abolishes the translation of viral proteins ci, 6k <dig> and nia/vpg required for ppv replication. the quantitative results showed that the viral rna in the protoplasts was detectable at  <dig> hpt, accumulated at  <dig> hpt and peaked at  <dig> hpt , followed by a decline at  <dig> hpt  <cit> . the time course progression of ppv infection in arabidopsis protoplasts is similar to that of cymbidium mosaic virus  in orchid protoplasts  <cit> . thus, three time points,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpt were selected for this study.

gene expression in ppv-infected arabidopsis protoplasts was analyzed by one-way anova to identify genes differentially expressed at each time point. the degree of biological variability and reproducibility of the microarray data was assessed by comparing the mean values of the normalized signal intensity from the protoplasts transfected with a non-infectious mutant, pppv-sk68Δ with all three independent biological replicates at each time point. the analysis resulted with a high correlation coefficient of  <dig>  –  <dig> , indicating low technical and biological variability between the samples used in the hybridizations. using fdr at 5%, we identified ~ <dig> %  of non-redundant genes that were significantly  differentially regulated in protoplasts transfected with the ppv infectious clone, pppv-sk <dig> at three different time points relative to the control transfected with the non-infectious deletion mutant, pppv-sk68Δ. these genes were further filtered using a  <dig> -fold increase or decrease in signal intensity, resulting in  <dig> nr genes that were induced , and  <dig> genes that were repressed , as illustrated in the venn diagrams . a comparison analysis between  <dig> induced and  <dig> suppressed genes identified  <dig> genes induced at one time point and were not repressed at other time points,  <dig> genes repressed at one time point and were not induced at other time points, and  <dig> genes induced and repressed at different time points  . the analysis also revealed that the number of repressed genes was greater than that of the induced genes at all three time points analyzed. the number of genes that were commonly repressed among the time points was  <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig> hpt,  <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig> hpt, and  <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig> hpt. we further examined each of these  <dig> induced and  <dig> repressed genes to see if they were also consistently induced or repressed at all three different time points of infection. fifteen genes were found to be constantly repressed and  <dig> were consistently induced in the ppv transfected protoplasts, suggesting that the proportion of genes repressed at all three time points were greater than that of the genes induced.

the genes induced or repressed in ppv-infected protoplasts were annotated, assigned to a predicted function and classified into  <dig> different major functional categories using the arabidopsis mips functional classification scheme . fisher's exact test  <cit>  was used to determine whether the representation of the number of genes in each functional category was significant  or by random chance. of the upregulated genes, transcripts involved in primary and secondary metabolism , cellular signalling , defence response , transcription factors  and transporters  were over-represented, while in the case of downregulation, genes involved in transcription factors , primary and secondary metabolism , kinases or cellular signalling , and defence responses  were over-represented. a complete list of induced or repressed genes in ppv-infected protoplasts in different functional groups is provided .

as evident , comparison of the differentially expressed genes between ppv-infected arabidopsis protoplasts  and ppv-infected leaf tissues  resulted in only  <dig> and  <dig> common genes that were significantly induced  and repressed , respectively. a few vital genes such as genes encoding heavy metal protein, disease resistance protein, ftsh protease, cytochrome p <dig> and β- <dig>  3-glucanase were significantly differentially regulated by ppv in the infected leaves and transfected protoplasts. the smaller percentage of significantly differentially regulated genes observed in the ppv-infected protoplasts than in the ppv-infected leaf suggests a remarkable gene expression differences between the two systems. however, as discussed above, the differences in the alteration of gene expression changes in the protoplasts induced by ppv infection could have been masked by harsh treatments during protoplast isolation, transfection and culture or might result from the two different ppv strains used. though the ppv-d and -m strains used in this study share more than 95% sequence identity  <cit> , these two strains may induce different symptoms on the same host  <cit> .

to visualize gene expression profiling at all three time points, a hierarchical clustering analysis was carried out on the  <dig> induced and  <dig> repressed genes . a gene tree heat map was built using pearson correlation distance metric with an average linkage algorithm. to understand further the temporal relationship of the host gene expression in ppv-infected protoplasts at each time point, twelve distinct groups of expression pattern clusters were generated on the significant differential gene expression datasets using k-means clustering with pearson correlation distance metric  . a complete list of genes induced or repressed at each time point in different cluster groups along with their expression levels and putative functions is provided . the clustering analysis also revealed greater changes in gene expression  at  <dig> hpt than at  <dig> hpt  and at  <dig> hpt  in ppv-infected arabidopsis protoplasts. these observations suggest that early gene expressions in response to ppv infection are active and dynamic.

early upregulated genes related to disease resistance or defence responses in ppv-infected arabidopsis protoplasts
ppv infection in protoplasts induced the expression of  <dig> genes. in contrast to about 11% of the suppressed genes that were common at different time points, there were no induced genes shared at different time points, suggesting induction of host gene expression was much more transient than suppression. genes related to defence, cellular signalling, primary and secondary metabolism, transcription and transporters were upregulated and over-represented. within these five categories, ~52%  of genes were predominantly upregulated  at  <dig> hpt . examples of the upregulated genes in the above functional categories include mads box protein, zinc finger family protein, wrky family transcription factor, avirulence -induced protein, hydrophobic protein, disease resistance tir-nbs-lrr , protein kinases and phosphatases.

another interesting gene upregulated by ppv encodes a disease resistance protein, tir-nbs-lrr. this gene was upregulated with  <dig> -fold in ppv-infected protoplasts at  <dig> hpt and  <dig> -fold at  <dig> hpt, and  <dig> -fold in ppv-infected leaves . in the arabidopsis  genome, there are  <dig> nbs-lrr-like genes  <cit> . the resistance gene nbs-lrr mostly confers resistance to viral diseases but not necessarily associates with cell death or tissue necrosis  <cit> . genes sw <dig>  n and rx are homologous to the nbs-lrr gene. rx resistance to potato virus x  is the most classical example, which shows an extreme resistance that inhibits virus replication without hypersensitive cell death  <cit> . the sw <dig> gene confers resistance to several tospoviruses  <cit> , and n and rx are effective against many natural variants of tmv and pvx  <cit> . since the specificity determinants subsist in lrr domains  <cit> , it would be interesting to find out if the nbs-lrr gene detected in the ppv-infected leaf plays a role in resistance responses to ppv infection.

the comparison of induced genes at different time points in ppv-infected protoplasts revealed that genes upregulated at  <dig> hpt might regulate their target genes at  <dig> hpt. for instance, two genes coding for cnd <dig> , a plastid specific dna binding factor, and calmodulin , a signalling binding protein were induced at  <dig> hpt and their target genes encoding metabolic enzymes such as serine carboxypeptidase  were upregulated at  <dig> hpt  <cit> . similarly, transcription factors such as zinc finger proteins  was upregulated at  <dig> hpt and the genes encoding enzymes such as gdsl-motif lipase  and glycosyl hydrolases  were upregulated at  <dig> hpt  <cit> . these results suggest that virus infection may induce expression of specific upstream regulator genes first which then activate the expression of downstream target genes.

inhibition of host mrna accumulation in ppv-infected protoplasts
based on the expression analysis , the number of repressed genes in the transfected protoplasts was greater than that of the genes induced at all time points, suggesting that at early infection stages, suppression is more active than induction of host gene expression. moreover, about 11%  of the suppressed genes overlapped at different time points, indicating a relatively stable suppression of genes. consistent with this, in pea cotyledons infected with pea seed borne mosaic virus , suppression of diverse host genes including seed storage proteins , and starch synthase occurs only in a zone of six to eight cells immediately behind the infection front, which coincided with the onset of viral replication  <cit> . in the present study, a gene coding for the seed storage protein cupin family  that shares sequence homology to the pea vicilin and convicilin was significantly repressed by ppv infection at  <dig> hpt in arabidopsis protoplasts. suppression of such host gene expression or "host shutoff" has been suggested to be due to stress responses, induced defence states or a mechanism employed by viruses to outcompete against host mrnas for host resources for their translation and replication  <cit> . study by rottier  <cit>  has demonstrated that protein synthesis in protoplasts is blocked in cowpea protoplasts transfected with cowpea mosaic virus. despite this inhibition, viral mrnas are preferentially translated. since both viruses and hosts share the same translational apparatus, viruses must have a mechanism to avoid this inhibition. it is not clear whether the disappearance of host mrnas is the consequence of mrna destabilization triggered by stress response, or host transcription inhibition by the virus, or targeted degradation through a virus-induced ribonuclease activity.

identification of a common set of genes in general stress and defence-related groups differentially regulated by infections of ppv and other positive sense rna viruses
we performed a cross sequence comparison analysis by blasting individual sequence of all the genes significantly differentially regulated by ppv in infected arabidopsis leaves against  <dig>  uniest sequences derived from ppv-infected p. persica leaves  <cit> . high-scoring pair  and e-value  were used to identify orthologs. a total of  <dig> induced  and  <dig> repressed arabidopsis genes showed high sequence similarity to p. persica uniests. of these  <dig> induced genes, approximately ~39%  and ~16%  of the genes were involved in metabolism and defence, respectively. the defence-related genes include those coding for pathogenesis related -proteins, heat shock and germin-like proteins  . an increased expression of pr proteins requires salicylic acid  signifying that compatible host-virus interactions induce defence-like responses through a sa dependent pathway  <cit> . more recently, it has been shown that ppv infection in the apoplastic space of p. persica leaves induces a thaumatin-like protein   <cit> . induction of such protein is thought to be mediated by an increase in the level of peroxidase accumulation  <cit> . a similar trend was also observed in ppv infected arabidopsis leaves where genes encoding pr- <dig> and peroxidase were significantly induced and their counterparts were also found in the uniest sequences derived from ppv-infected p. persica.

to determine whether the diverse rna viruses have the ability to elicit common gene expression changes, we cross-compared the genes that were significantly differentially regulated by ppv infection in this study   to those arabidopsis genes that were differentially regulated by infections of other positive sense rna viruses including cmv  <cit> ; tmv  <cit> ; tumv, and oil seed rape mosaic virus   <cit> , and to five diverse rna viruses, i.e., tumv, ormv, turnip vein clearing virus , potato virus x , and cmv  <cit> . collectively,  <dig> common genes  were identified from this analysis. these genes were further classified into  <dig> different categories. group a contains  <dig> genes induced by infections of ppv and other positive sense rna viruses. about ~40%  are metabolic genes and ~8%  are defence-related genes. group b includes  <dig> arabidopsis genes that were induced during ppv infection but repressed by infections of other positive sense rna viruses. about ~27%  are involved in metabolism. group c comprises of  <dig> arabidopsis genes repressed during ppv infection but induced by infections of other positive sense rna viruses. for example, a defence-related gene encoding glycosyl transferase , which was repressed in ppv-infected leaves at  <dig> dpi was observed to be induced more than  <dig> -fold in tmv-infected leaves  <cit>  at  <dig> dpi. group d consists of  <dig> arabidopsis genes repressed by infections of ppv and other positive sense rna viruses. group e comprises  <dig> genes that were induced during ppv infection but either induced or suppressed by infections of other positive sense rna viruses. group f contains  <dig> arabidopsis genes repressed during ppv infection but induced during infections of more than one positive sense rna virus. previous studies have revealed that in virus-infected arabidopsis and tomato leaves as many as one-third of the genes commonly induced by viruses are known or predicted to be involved in plant defence- and stress-related genes  <cit> . in the current study, about 52%  of the functional proteins differentially regulated in response to infections of ppv and other positive sense rna viruses are involved in defence, cellular signalling and metabolism. twenty-nine cellular signalling genes involved in defence mechanisms including protein kinase , protein phosphatase 2c , pyruvate kinase , serine/threonine protein kinase  and calmodulin-binding family protein   <cit>  were induced by infections of ppv and other positive sense rna viruses. substantial induction of these defence, cellular signalling and metabolism genes by ppv and other positive sense rna viruses in infected leaf tissues suggests that there is a shared pathway modulating their expression.

validation of microarray data by semi-quantitative rt-pcr  and northern hybridizations
since most changes in gene expression occurred at  <dig> hpt,  <dig> transcripts significantly upregulated and  <dig> transcript significantly downregulated at  <dig> hpt were selected to validate the microarray data using sqrt-pcr. we also selected  <dig> other transcripts that were significantly upregulated at  <dig> or  <dig> hpt for validating the microarray data through sqrt-pcr. we further confirmed the microarray data of  <dig> arabidopsis genes that were differentially regulated in both ppv-infected protoplasts and leaves using sqrt-pcr or northern hybridizations. overall, the expression patterns of all the  <dig> genes analyzed by sqrt-pcr were consistent with those by microarray hybridizations  . however, the relative levels of gene expression obtained from sqrt-pcr or northern hybridizations were lower than those from microarray hybridizations. this inconsistency could have been attributed to several factors: the differences in the efficiencies of reverse transcriptase, the low copy of an mrna transcript and the different priming methods or the fundamental differences in data normalization procedures between microarray and northern hybridizations or sqrt-pcr. for example, in this study, the former was achieved through the global normalization, while the later used the expression of the housekeeping gene actin to normalize the sqrt-pcr or northern blots. so, application of normalization criteria might have an effect in the correlation of fold changes between these two methods  <cit> . though the housekeeping gene actin was considered to be constitutively expressed in tissues, due to the nature of the processing of hybridizing samples to northern blots, one could reasonably assume a possible inconsistency resulting from these two methods. certainly, other sensitive techniques such as quantitative rt-pcr  and nuclear run-on assays can be used further to validate the results generated from these expression studies.

CONCLUSIONS
microarray analyses conducted in this study allowed us to gain insights into global gene expression changes in arabidopsis associated with ppv infection, symptom development and defence responses. at  <dig> dpi, ppv displayed mild growth retardation, slightly delayed flowering and bolting. ppv infection was associated with the downregulation of genes related to development/storage proteins, protein synthesis and translation and cell wall-related genes and the upregulation of genes involved in soluble sugars, starch, amino acid, intracellular membrane/membrane-bound organelles, chloroplast and protein fate. transcriptional profiling of ppv-infected protoplasts revealed that at early infection stages, downregulation of host gene expression was more prominent than upregulation. concomitant with this downregulation, several defence and cellular signalling genes were induced during ppv infection. these genes may be involved in signal transduction pathways to induce resistance to combat the virus. further targeted functional studies of these early defence-related genes will help unravel their biological function during the course of ppv infection.
