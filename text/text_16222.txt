BACKGROUND
the mitotic phase, which comprises mitosis and cytokinesis, is a fundamental process for faithful transmission of genetic information from one cell generation to the next. the main purpose of mitosis is to segregate sister chromatids into two daughter cells. the regulation of mitotic progression relies mainly on two post-translational mechanisms; protein phosphorylation and proteolysis. cell division is regulated by mitotic kinases, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> , the polo family, the nima , and the aurora family, as well as kinases implicated in mitotic checkpoints, mitotic exit and cytokinesis  <cit> .

post-translational modifications of core histones play a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene expression  <cit> . although the n-terminal sequence and phosphorylations of histone h <dig> are highly conserved among eukaryotes, the distribution patterns of phosphorylated histone h <dig> on the chromosomes differ between animals and plants. in mammalian cells, h3s10ph begins to appear in pericentromeric regions from g <dig> phase, spreading along the chromosome periphery until metaphase, and then disappearing at late anaphase  <cit> . the phosphorylation pattern of h3s <dig> is similar to that of h3s10ph during mitosis  <cit> . because the spatial and temporal patterns of h3s10ph and h3s28ph are consistent with chromosome condensation and decondensation, it is thought that h3s10ph and h3s28ph have a crucial role in chromosome condensation in animals. in contrast, h3s10ph and h3s28ph occur in the pericentromeric regions--not along the whole chromosome--from prophase to anaphase in plants  <cit> . these distribution patterns suggest that h3s10ph and h3s28ph play a crucial role in cohesion and segregation of sister chromatids  <cit> . in plants, ataur <dig>  phosphorylates histone h <dig> at ser <dig> and ser <dig> in vitro  <cit> . inhibition of aurora kinase by hesperadin treatment prevents h3s10ph and h3s28ph in tobacco by- <dig> cells and h3s10ph in arabidopsis suspension cells  <cit> . thus, aurora kinases phosphorylate histone h <dig> at ser <dig> and ser <dig> in plants.

h3t <dig> and h3t <dig> are also phosphorylated, but their distribution patterns differ from those of h3s10ph and h3s28ph during mitosis. in mammalian cells, h3t3ph and h3t11ph occur preferentially at the centromere from prophase to anaphase  <cit> . in contrast, h3t3ph and h3t11ph are distributed along the entire length of the chromosome in plants  <cit> . aurora kinases phosphorylate histone h <dig> at ser <dig> and ser <dig>  but the kinase responsible for h3t3ph and h3t11ph is yet to be identified in plants.

haspin  was first identified as a testis-specific gene in mice  <cit> . although haspin mrna levels were highest in the testis, lower levels of haspin mrna were detected in other organs, suggesting that expression of haspin is not truly specific to haploid germ cells  <cit> . human haspin could phosphorylate histone h <dig> at thr <dig> and was involved in chromosome congression during mitosis  <cit> . the centromeric localization of h3t3ph and the haspin-knockdown phenotype in human cells indicated that haspin is required for maintenance of centromeric cohesion during mitosis  <cit> . recently, three studies on saccharomyces cerevisiae, xenopus, and human revealed the novel cascade leading to the recruitment of mitotic kinases to the centromere  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, haspin interacts with cohesin, and the cohesin-associated haspin phosphorylates histone h <dig> at thr <dig> on the inner centromere  <cit> . the phosphorylated h3t <dig> then binds the chromosomal passenger complex  containing aurora b, thereby recruiting cpc to the inner centromere  <cit> . thus, cpc functions in determining the correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, and this function is regulated via h <dig> phosphorylation on the inner centromere.

analyses of haspin were first carried out in yeast and animals, and although it is clear that this protein has roles in mitosis and cell division, the function of haspin in organogenesis remains unclear. in this study, we identified a. thaliana haspin, characterized its kinase activity, and determined its localization during mitosis. expression of a kinase domain mutant of athaspin inhibited root growth, suggesting that haspin is involved in cell division during mitosis.

RESULTS
haspin candidate gene in arabidopsis thaliana
genes encoding haspin homologs have been identified in a wide variety of eukaryotes including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and fungi, but not in prokaryotes and archaea  <cit>  . except for caenorhabditis elegans and s. cerevisiae, most organisms have one haspin kinase gene. in a blast search of the a. thaliana genome, one haspin candidate gene showed high similarity  to human haspin kinase in the kinase domain. the second hit gene showed lower similarity . one haspin candidate gene has been identified in some plant species, including ferns, mosses, and algae . although there were two putative genes identified in glycine max and medicago truncatula, the synteny analysis from phytozome  <cit>  suggested that these genes were duplicated. in the a. thaliana genome, the putative haspin gene  is designated as athaspin . the c-terminal regions of haspin proteins have a conserved kinase domain  <cit>  . the amino acid sequence of athaspin cdna showed 38% similarity with human haspin in the kinase domain. recently, the crystal structure of the kinase domain of human haspin was solved  <cit> . although athaspin showed low similarity to human haspin across the entire kinase domain, the residues that act as atp and mg2+ ion-binding sites were conserved between human and a. thaliana . these data suggested that the mitotic kinase function of haspin may be conserved in plants.

athaspin phosphorylates histone h <dig> at thr <dig> and thr <dig> in vitro
the human haspin protein k511a, which contains a mutation of a single conserved lysine residue that is important for atp binding, has no kinase activity  <cit> . to examine whether purified gst-athaspin has kinase activity, an in vitro kinase assay was performed using purified gst-athaspin and gst-athaspin kd   with or without atp. phosphorylated proteins were detected by proq diamond phosphoprotein stain. as expected, gst-athaspin-kd was not autophosphorylated even in the presence of atp . however, gst-athaspin was autophosphorylated in the presence or absence of atp . this result indicated that autophosphorylation of athaspin was not dependent on addition of atp, and that this lysine residue is also required for autophosphorylation of athaspin. this result also suggested that gst-athaspin was autophosphorylated during production in escherichia coli.

the only known substrate of haspin is the thr <dig> of histone h <dig>  <cit> . to determine whether athaspin is a histone h <dig> thr <dig> kinase, we carried out an in vitro kinase assay using purified gst-athaspin, a positive control , and plant histone h <dig> as the substrate. the positive control, gst-ataur <dig>  is a histone h <dig> ser <dig> and ser <dig> kinase  <cit> . gst-ataur <dig> phosphorylated histone h <dig> at ser <dig> and ser <dig>  while gst-athaspin phosphorylated histone h <dig> at thr <dig> in vitro. surprisingly, gst-athaspin also phosphorylated histone h <dig> at thr <dig> in vitro .

to confirm the specificity of antibodies against h3t3ph and h3t11ph, an in vitro kinase assay was performed with purified gst-histone h <dig> tail proteins containing mutations at thr <dig>  thr <dig>  and at several residues adjacent to them . using anti-h3t3ph antibodies, bands were detected in the case of normal histone h <dig> and s10a, t11a, and g12a mutants, but not in the case of r2a, t3a, or k4a mutants . using anti-h3t11ph antibodies, bands were detected in the case of r2a, t3a, and k4a mutants, but not in the case of s10a, t11a, or g12a mutants . gst-athaspin-kd  had no kinase activity towards h <dig> at thr <dig> and thr <dig> in vitro. these results indicated that the athaspin kinase phosphorylates histone h <dig> at thr <dig> and thr <dig> in vitro.

subcellular localization of athaspin in by- <dig> cells
to analyze the subcellular localization of athaspin during cell division, we transformed nicotiana tabacum cv. bright yellow- <dig>  cultured cells with gfp-fused athaspin and observed tobacco by- <dig> cells stably expressing athaspin-gfp with dna stained by hoechst  <dig> . during interphase, athaspin was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear periphery. after nuclear envelope breakdown , athaspin invaded the nuclear region. during metaphase, fluorescent signals of athaspin-gfp were also observed on the chromosome . after metaphase, athaspin-gfp was localized with the phragmoplast from its initial formation at the center of the equatorial plane to its expansion towards the cell periphery as the cell cycle progressed.

to analyze the relationship between athaspin and microtubules, we observed transgenic by- <dig> cells expressing gfp-α-tubulin and inducibly expressing athaspin-tdtomato. after nebd, athaspin-tdtomato immediately invaded the nucleus, while α-tubulin remained at the nuclear periphery. during prometaphase and metaphase, microtubules organized the mitotic spindle, while athaspin-tdtomato was widely distributed over the spindle. athaspin-tdtomato signals were observed on the chromosomes aligned at the equatorial plate . during anaphase, athaspin-tdtomato localized with the sister chromatids, and during telophase, it colocalized with the phragmoplast. as the phragmoplast expanded toward the cell periphery, athaspin was moved toward the cell periphery. however, the movement of athaspin-tdtomato differed from that of phragmoplast . at the onset of cell division in higher plants, the pre-prophase band , which is a dense band of cortical microtubules, begins to form at the future-cell-division plane. until nebd, athaspin-tdtomato was localized at the cytoplasm but not at the ppb , and then athaspin-tdtomato dispersed after nebd . as the cell plate expanded during telophase, the phragmoplast was depolymerized in the center of the equatorial plate and repolymerized along the edge of the growing cell plate. although the phragmoplast expanded toward the cell periphery, athaspin-tdtomato remained around the cell plate until the end of telophase . considering the dynamics of athaspin-tdtomato, athaspin could not be directly involved in the regulation of the dynamics of microtubules during mitosis.

to reveal whether athaspin phosphorylates histone h <dig> at thr <dig> and thr <dig> in vivo, we performed indirect immunofluorescence using anti-h3t3ph, h3t11ph, and h3s28ph antibodies in by- <dig> cells . during interphase, no signals of h3t3ph, h3t11ph, and h3s28ph were observed. the h3t3ph signal was first detected on chromosomes in early prophase before nebd, whereas the h3t11ph signal was first detected on chromosomes in late prophase after nebd. during late prophase, h3t3ph signals were observed along the chromosome, while h3s28ph signals were observed at pericentromeric regions. during prometaphase, the h3t3ph signals were stronger at pericentromeric regions than on the chromosome arms. signals of h3t3ph increased at the pericentromeric region until late metaphase. in contrast, phosphorylated h3t <dig> was entirely localized on the chromosome from prometaphase to anaphase. signals of h3t3ph disappeared after chromosome segregation during anaphase, while h3t11ph signals were still localized on the chromosome. a moderate-strength athaspin-tdtomato signal was observed on the chromosome during prometaphase and metaphase . this localization of athaspin-tdtomato overlapped with those of phosphorylated h3t <dig> and h3t <dig> from after nebd until anaphase in by- <dig> cells .

then, we observed the localization of athaspin-tdtomato in fixed by- <dig> cells with paraformaldehyde . at early prophase before nebd, athaspin-tdtomato was localized in the cytoplasm around the nucleus . at prophase after nebd, athaspin-tdtomato enveloped the entire chromosome . this localization also suggested that athaspin phosphorylates histone h <dig> at thr <dig> and thr <dig> during mitosis.

expression of athaspin in developing organs
according to the microarray data publically available at genevestigator  <cit> , athaspin is expressed at relatively high levels in the root tips and shoot apex. we plotted the rna profiles using published microarray datasets  <cit> . expression of athaspin was activated at  <dig> to  <dig> h after removal of the dna synthesis inhibitor, aphidicolin . this profile of athaspin expression was very similar to those of ataurs and mitotic atcycb1; <dig>  indicating that athaspin is a mitotic-specific kinase. rt-pcr analyses showed that athaspin was expressed in multiple tissues . although haspin was first identified as a testis-specific gene in mice  <cit> , this expression profile indicated that athaspin is not a reproduction-specific gene in a. thaliana. athaspin showed relatively high expression in flower buds and flowers with high cell division activity.

to investigate the expression patterns of athaspin in arabidopsis plants, we produced transgenic plants expressing athaspin-gfp under the control of a native promoter region . athaspin-gfp was expressed in meristems and primordia of root tips, lateral roots , the shoot apex, leaf , and flowers . fluorescent signals of athaspin-gfp were observed in ovules . during embryogenesis, athaspin-gfp was expressed in embryos and suspensors from the one-cell stage to the four-cell stage . the expression of athaspin-gfp persisted in the torpedo-stage embryo . thus, the expression patterns of athaspin-gfp were strongly correlated with cell division during organ development.

to study the subcellular localization of athaspin in detail, we performed time-lapse analysis of athaspin-gfp in root tips and the embryo. at interphase, the fluorescent signals of athaspin-gfp were observed in the cytoplasm. during mitosis, athaspin-gfp was invaded the nucleus at prometaphase and expanded toward the cell periphery at cytokinesis . these localization patterns corresponded to those observed in by- <dig> cells.

inducible athaspin-kd decreases meristem size in roots
we searched t-dna tagging lines to elucidate the function of athaspin; however, there were no athaspin knockout mutants. considering the possibility that the loss-of function mutant of athaspin is embryonic lethal, we constructed a line with chemical-inducible overexpression of a kinase domain mutant of athaspin  using the estradiol-inducible xve system  <cit> . when grown on vertically oriented plates with  <dig> μm 17-β-estradiol, athaspin-kd-venus plants exhibited decreased primary root growth from  <dig> days after imbibition, compared with root growth of col. and athaspin-venus plants . to investigate the effect of overexpression of athaspin-kd-venus on root tip cells, 6-day-old roots were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  to observe the meristem by detecting the dna ploidy level of the cells. the root meristem was smaller in athaspin-kd-venus plants than in col. plants, but the meristem was not affected in athaspin-venus plants . moreover, most athaspin-kd-venus plants showed abnormally oriented cell plates . these results suggested that misoriented cell divisions were responsible for the abnormal cell pattern in the root tips. these phenotypes were not observed in transgenic plants without induction of athaspin-venus and athaspin-kd-venus . athaspin-gfp was expressed in the meristem, but not in the quiescent center  or the columella of root tips . these results suggest that athaspin may have a role in mitotic cell division.

discussion
athaspin phosphorylates histone h <dig> at both thr <dig> and thr <dig> in vitro
in this study, we identified a plant haspin kinase in a. thaliana. haspin kinases are conserved from yeast to human. most organisms have one haspin kinase gene, except for c. elegans and s. cerevisiae. some plant species, including a. thaliana, have one haspin candidate gene . even in the kinase domain, there is low homology  between athaspin and human haspin. however, the important residues for kinase activity, such as those associated with atp/mg2+ ion-binding, are well-conserved in a. thaliana .

as expected, gst-athaspin phosphorylated histone h <dig> at thr <dig> in vitro. surprisingly, gst-athaspin was also able to phosphorylate histone h <dig> at thr <dig> in vitro. it has not been determined whether the haspin of fission yeast or xenopus can phosphorylate histone h <dig> at thr <dig>  however, the human haspin phosphorylates histone h <dig> at thr <dig>  but not thr <dig> in vitro  <cit> . in the case of aurora kinase, because its consensus sequence is , ataur <dig> can phosphorylate histone h <dig> at ser <dig>  and ser <dig>   <cit> . however, the amino acid sequence around thr <dig>  differs from that around thr <dig> . point mutational analysis of human haspin revealed the important residues for histone h <dig> phosphorylation in the catalytic cleft  <cit> . these residues are almost all conserved in a. thaliana , with only one residue differing between human  and arabidopsis . the human haspin mutant d709n shows reduced affinity for the histone h <dig> tail and impaired ability to phosphorylate h <dig>  <cit> . although athaspin can phosphorylate histone h <dig>  it is possible that its substrate specificity is wider than that of the human haspin. in mammalian cells, the dlk/zip kinase phosphorylates histone h <dig> at thr <dig> in vitro  <cit> , but there is no direct evidence that it phosphorylates histone h <dig> at thr <dig> in vivo. however, the centromeric localization of dlk/zip during mitosis suggests that this kinase is responsible for h3t11ph. the a. thaliana genome contains no dlk/zip kinase orthologues, and thus, athaspin has an additional role as a h <dig> thr <dig> kinase in a. thaliana.

phosphorylation of histone h <dig> at thr <dig> and thr11
mitotic phosphorylation of histone h <dig> at ser <dig>  ser <dig>  thr <dig>  and thr <dig> is highly conserved among eukaryotes. although phosphorylation of histone h <dig> was first observed more than  <dig> years ago, the functions of this modification remain unclear  <cit> . there is an apparent correlation between h3s10ph and chromosome condensation during mitosis, suggesting that h3s10ph is important for chromosome structure. however, h3s10ph is not required for chromosome condensation in some species  <cit> . in animals, h3s10ph and h3s28ph occur along the entire chromosome, while h3t3ph and h3t11ph occur only at pericentromeric regions. the functions of h3t3ph and h3t11ph have not been characterized. in contrast to the case in animals, h3t3ph and h3t11ph are preferentially distributed along the entire chromosome in plants . thus, the localization and timing of histone h <dig> ser and thr phosphorylation during mitosis differ between plants and animals. however, the fact that haspin and aurora kinases are responsible for histone h <dig> phosphorylations in plants and animals suggests that the functions of histone h <dig> phosphorylations are conserved among eukaryotes.

fluorescent protein fused to athaspin  was localized in the cytoplasm during interphase until nebd. the interphase localization of athaspin differs from that of human haspin, which localizes in the nucleus during interphase  <cit> . after nebd, athaspin-fp invaded into the nucleus and spread along the chromosomes and throughout the cytoplasm until metaphase. a strong athaspin-fp signal was observed on the chromosome during prometaphase and metaphase. these localization patterns of athaspin-fp were consistent with that of athaspin-gfp driven by the native promoter in a. thaliana . although no contigs containing haspin orthologues were found in the by- <dig> est database  <cit> , athaspin shares 61% amino acid sequence identity in the kinase domain to a tomato haspin orthologue from the kazusa tomato sbm database  <cit> , suggesting that the localization and dynamics of athaspin-fp reflect those of an endogenous haspin protein in by- <dig> cells.

this localization of athaspin-fp is consistent with that of phosphorylated h3t <dig> and h3t <dig> in by- <dig> cells . the timing of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of h3t <dig> and h3t <dig> are distinct during mitosis. the h3t3ph begins at early prophase before nebd, while h3t11ph occurs at prophase after nebd. dephosphorylation of h3t <dig> occurs at anaphase, while that of h3t <dig> occurs in telophase. these results suggested that there are different phosphatases responsible for h3t <dig> and h3t <dig> dephosphorylation in plants. we cannot exclude the possibility that there is another histone h <dig> thr <dig> and thr <dig> kinase in addition to athaspin, because athaspin was in the cytoplasm, but h3t3ph signals were detected before nebd. another possibility is the specificity of the antibodies against h3t3ph and h3t11ph. the in vitro kinase assay revealed that the antibodies against h3t3ph and h3t11ph did not show cross-reactivity with other histone h <dig> phosphorylations . however, we do not know whether these antibodies react with other histone modifications in vivo. an aurora kinase inhibitor prevents both h3s10ph and h3s28ph, even though these two phosphorylation events occur at different times during mitosis in tobacco by- <dig> cells  <cit> . similarly, athaspin could phosphorylate histone h <dig> at thr <dig> and thr <dig> in planta.

athaspin is involved in cell division
because of the presence of the plant cell wall, cell division, including cytokinesis, is more complex in plants than in animals. a plant-specific cytoskeletal structure, the phragmoplast, is required for completion of cytokinesis in plants  <cit> . athaspin-tdtomato was localized at the phragmoplast after chromosome segregation. although the phragmoplast expanded to the cell wall, athaspin-tdtomato remained around the cell plate . these dynamics of athaspin-tdtomato localization and movement suggested that athaspin is associated with cell division.

analyses of arabidopsis plants expressing athaspin-gfp driven by its own promoter indicated that athaspin is expressed in root meristems, shoot meristems, floral meristems, and embryos with high cell-division activities. in addition, overexpression of athaspin-kd-venus resulted in defects in root growth. plant growth is regulated by cell division and cell expansion, and defects in these processes resulted in delayed root growth. cell expansion is regulated by microtubule-associated proteins   <cit> . maps have roles in microtubule polymerization, depolymerization, bundling, and nucleation. however, no filamentous structures of fluorescent protein-fused athaspin were observed at interphase or during mitosis in arabidopsis and by- <dig> cells . the expression of athaspin-gfp in the root meristem, except for qc and columella cells, indicated that athaspin may have a role in cell division during mitosis . furthermore, some abnormally oriented cells were observed in root rips of plants overexpressing athaspin-kd-venus . although further analysis of down-regulation of athaspin is needed, these results suggested that athaspin-kd-venus may inhibit cell division in a dominant negative manner.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the haspin kinase in a. thaliana was identified as a mitotic histone h <dig> threonine kinase. the expression and dominant-negative analysis showed that athaspin may have a role in cell division during mitosis. the functions of h <dig> threonine phosphorylation remain obscure in animals and plants. recent studies have shown that h3t3ph by s. cerevisiae, xenopus and human haspin is required for the accumulation of aurora b on the centromere, and for subsequent activation of aurora b kinase activity  <cit> . therefore, athaspin and ataur <dig> coordinately regulate cell division during mitosis via h <dig> phosphorylation. as previously described  <cit> , homologues of cpc components  could not be found in plants via sequence similarities. however, the cpc has an important role in proper chromosome segregation via regulation of haspin and aurora b in animals and yeast  <cit> . the functions and localizations of haspin and aurora kinases are partly conserved in a. thaliana  <cit> , suggesting that functional analogues of cpc components exist in plants. further analyses of the substrates of athaspin and their downregulating mechanisms will provide insights into the regulation of cell division during plant growth and development.
