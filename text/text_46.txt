BACKGROUND
ovarian cancer, one of the most malignant gynecologic cancers, is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in the united states. according to the american cancer society,  <dig>  women will receive a new diagnosis and  <dig>  will die of this disease in  <dig>  the majority of ovarian cancers are serous ovarian carcinomas and only less than 20% of them can be detected early. high-stage cancer patients are usually treated with platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy after debulking surgery. platinumresistant cancer recurs in approximately 25% of patients within six months after therapy, and the overall five-year survival probability is only 31%  <cit> . while the molecular mechanism of ovarian cancer remains unclear, studies have suggested that many different factors may contribute to this disease, among which there are tens of well-known oncogenes and tumor suppressors including tp <dig>  pik3c, brca <dig> and brca <dig>  in particular the mutation of gene tp <dig> is the most common, occurring in at least 70% of advanced-stage cases  <cit> . many of the existing studies however, have been focused on a single type of data, most frequently, gene expression analysis  <cit> . as pointed out by many researchers, the analysis based on individual gene often fail to provide even moderate prediction accuracy of the cancer status. thus a systems biology approach that combines multiple genetic and epigenetic profiles for an integrative analysis provides a new direction to study the regulatory network associated with ovarian cancer.

the rapid advances in next-generation sequencing technology now allow genome-wide analysis of genetic and epigenetic features simultaneously. the timely advent of tcga project has provided the most comprehensive genomic data resource from over  <dig> types of cancers . for example, the tcga ovarian cancer data contain both clinical and molecular profiles from  <dig> tumor samples and  <dig> normal controls. the molecular profile includes gene expression , genotype , exon expression, microrna expression , copy number variation , dna methylation, somatic mutation, gene expression , microrna-seq and protein expression. the clinical information includes records on recurrence, survival, and treatment resistance. these massive complex data sets have driven enthusiasm to study the molecular mechanism of cancers through computational approaches  <cit> . among the developed methods, bayesian network  is one of the most frequently used multivariate models. the bn approach is more appealing than graphs constructed based on correlation or mutual information metrics for it allows rigorous statistical inference of causality between genetic and epigenetic features. however most of the existing studies have been focused on one type of data either continuous or discrete  <cit> . how to combine different types of complex data for causal inference in bn poses a big challenge. in addition, deducing the complex network structure from data remains an open problem partially due to the lack of prior information, relatively smaller sample size and the high dimensionality of data   <cit> .

a necessary and important step to construct a bn from tens of thousands of features is feature selection, i.e., to identify a subset of the most-relevant features. removing irrelevant or redundant features helps improve computing efficiency and estimation accuracy in the causal network. existing feature selection methods can be roughly classified into two categories: wrapper approach  <cit>  and filter approach  <cit> . for large data sets, the filter approach using significance test for difference between the cancer and control samples is more commonly used due to its simplicity. as some features could be causal to other features while having no direct association with the cancer phenotypes, the independent test can filter out many related features . one innovation of this paper is a novel stepwise correlation-based selector  that mimics the hierarchy of the bn for feature selection. the selected features from the tcga data are a mixture of continuous and categorical variables. to integrate them into the same bn, we discretize the continuous variables and use a logit link function for casual inference. the proposed approach is applied to the tcga ovarian cancer data and leads to a series of interesting findings that shed light into the genetic/epigenetic mechanisms of ovarian cancer.

RESULTS
preprocessing of tcga ovarian cancer data
in this paper, we only consider four types of molecular data including gene expression, dna copy number variation, promoter methylation and somatic mutation . this data set contains the expression values of  <dig>  genes, out of which,  <dig>  had methylation level measured for each cpg island located in their promoter regions. if multiple cpg islands exist for a given gene, we took the average as the overall methylation level. the copy number was measured for each chromosomal segment, recorded as a seg.mean value, with the segment length varying from hundred up to tens of millions base pairs by the circular binary segmentation  performed by tcga. out of  <dig>  genes,  <dig>  have well defined locations on the genome provided by ucsc genome browser  and each of them was assigned a value as the copy number. if a gene entirely falls within a chromosome segment, we assigned it the corresponding seg.mean value . for the somatic mutation data, we defined a binary variable where "1" stands for all the non-silent mutations  and "0" for silent mutations or not being mutated, resulting in  <dig>  genes with somatic mutations . for the gene expression and methylation data, we applied an existing method by  <cit>  to remove the effects due to different age groups and batches. figure  <dig> illustrates an example for brca <dig> gene where the boxplots showed this procedure was effective in removing the age and batch effects.summary of tcga ovarian cancer data

the second step in data preprocessing is to discretize the continuous random variables. we classified the gene expression level into three groups using k-means clustering algorithm, namely low, midium, and high. likewise the promoter methylation level was classified into either hyper or hypo state, and the copy number status into two states: gain or loss. the discretized variables were the input of the bayesian network to be discussed below.

feature selection
the pipeline we propose in this paper assumes that cancer phenotype is directly associated with gene expression, which can be potentially driven by genetic and epigenetic changes . figure  <dig> illustrates the workflow of our proposed framework. we first identify a set of tumor suppressors and oncogenes by differential expression analysis between the cancer and control groups. this set of genes, together with those that were previously reported in the literature as cancer-relevant, form the set of seed genes for further feature selection. these seed genes are then fed into our proposed stepwise correlation-based selector  to select other features. the scbs is motivated by the hierarchy of causality in the bayesian network. for example, suppose there is a causal relationship a →b →cancer. though a to b or b to cancer has strong directed association, the association between a and cancer could decay greatly so that it cannot be detected. the scbs procedure starts with detection of features significantly correlated with the cancer and then progressively selects subsequent features that correlate with the selected features. our simulation study presented in the methods section shows that the proposed scbs is more effective to select important features that are involved in the phenotype-related pathways but indirectly associated with the cancer phenotype.workflow of our integrative framework.




the first step in feature selection is to define a set of seed genes out of  <dig>  genes that have records of expression level and at least one of the three genetic factors . we conducted a nonparametric test to identify the most differentially expressed genes between case and control groups, as well as the most differentially methylated genes, most differentially mutated genes and genes with most differentiate copy numbers. a gene was defined as a candidate oncogene or tumor suppressor if it satisfies all the following three conditions:  the p-value of gene expression was statistically significant under benjamini-hochberg  procedure with false discovery rate  ≤  <dig> ;  the p-value of somatic mutation/promoter methylation/copy number was also significant under bh procedure with fdr ≤ <dig> ; and  the absolute value of correlation coefficient between gene expression and somatic mutation/promoter methylation/copy number was greater than  <dig> . the p-values were calculated using wilcoxon rank-sum test and the correlation coefficients were calculated using pearson’s method. this procedure resulted in  <dig> potential tumor suppressors or oncogenes ,  <dig> of which were well-studied tumor suppressors and oncogenes for ovarian cancer from literature . the union of the two sets of  <dig> genes were defined as seed genes and generated an additional  <dig> nodes out of more than  <dig>  candidate features by the stepwise correlation based selection  procedure, which include  <dig> gene expressions,  <dig> copy number variation sites,  <dig> methylation sites and one somatic mutation site at gene tp <dig>  tumor suppressors and oncogenes from tcga data

bayesian network prediction
the  <dig> nodes  were fit into the bayesian network through a logit link function using the blockwise coordinate descent algorithm for penalized maximum likelihood estimation procedure  <cit>  .the predicted network contains  <dig> edges , where the direction of the edge indicates the downstream feature is regulated by the upstream one. we found the cnvs are the major factor that accounts for differential gene expression. in addition most of the  <dig> genes were cnv-amplified in cancer samples, suggesting that many amplified genes may act as cancer drivers, confirming findings from a breast cancer study  <cit> . this network also confirmed many previously reported gene-gene interactions. to name a few, for example, the edge from tpx <dig> to aurka could be explained by the fact that the protein encoded by the tpx <dig> gene activates aurka by inducing autophosphorylation  <cit> . the connection between brca <dig> and nbr <dig> could be due to the shared bi-directional promoter between the two genes  <cit> . the connection between stat <dig> and etv <dig> was suggested previously that etv <dig> is a negative regulator of stat <dig> activity  <cit> . the edge from cdkn2a to ccne <dig> is a known gene-gene regulation in the rb signaling pathway  <cit> . the edge from myc to imphd <dig> confirms that myc depletion results in repression of imphd <dig>   <cit> . these results suggested that the proposed pipeline is capable of revealing important genetic or epigenetic pathways that underlie the complex cancer phenotype.predicted graph by bayesian network model with logit link function and blockwise coordinate descent algorithm, with  <dig> nodes including expression level of  <dig> genes , copy number at  <dig> sites , methylation at  <dig> sites  and  <dig> somatic mutation at gene

the average degree  of the graph is  <dig>  indicating that the inferred network is sparse with moderate complexity. due to the directionality of bn, one could also obtain the indegree and outdegree separately for every single node. figure  <dig> shows the observed distribution of outdegree, where the mean and standard deviation are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. we identified  <dig> nodes with significantly larger outdegree  in the network including arid1a, c19orf <dig>  csnk2a <dig>  derl <dig>  trmt <dig>  col5a <dig>  tcf <dig>  lum, tpx <dig>  ube2c, dpm <dig>  ndufb <dig>  and ndufb <dig> . these hub genes all have known functions and have causal effect on at least seven neighboring genes, suggesting that they may play important roles in driving corresponding local subnetworks. some of the hub genes have been reported in the literature that are related to ovarian cancer. for instance, arid1a is known to promote the formation of swi/snf chromatin remodeling complexes containing brg <dig> or brm, and is a candidate tumor suppressor not only in clear cell ovarian cancer but also in endometrioid cancers and uterine endometrioid carcinomas  <cit> . c19orf <dig> is known to be associated with leydig cell tumors which are a member of the sex cord-stromal tumor group of ovarian and testicular cancers and it has a potential role in hypercalcemia of malignancy  <cit> . cskn2a <dig> is a well-known oncogene that can phosphorylate a number of key intracellular signaling proteins implicated in tumor suppression  and oncogenesis . this gene also influences wnt signaling via beta-catenin phosphorylation and the pi3k signaling pathway via the phosphorylation of akt  <cit> . interestingly these  <dig> hub genes can clearly distinguish the cancer samples from the normal samples as revealed by a multi-dimensional scaling plot  based on the correlation dissimilarity metric . this suggests that the thirteen hub genes may present the major difference between the cancer and normal samples. the early-stage and high-grade tumor samples however are not well distinguished.histogram of outdegree  for each gene in the predicted network, the mean degree and standard deviation are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. genes with outdegree greater than  <dig>  are identified as hub genes. the  <dig> hub genes are listed in table  <dig>

gene clusters
the  <dig> genes  were identified to fall into four major clusters corresponding to distinct functions by k-means clustering method . cluster  <dig>  contains  <dig> genes, mainly related to cell division, mitosis, spindle formation etc. cluster  <dig>  contains  <dig> genes, most of which are functionally related to growth factor, cell shape, cell motility, tumor invasion etc. cluster  <dig>  contains  <dig> genes, mostly related to mitochondrial system, membrane process etc. cluster  <dig>  is the largest and most complicated cluster harboring  <dig> genes. this large cluster communicates between the other three clusters , which are nearly independent from each other. this can be seen from the summary statistics of within and between cluster causal edges in table  <dig>  these findings could be implicative of some important molecular pathways, which may or may not have been identified, that drive the development of ovarian cancer.identification of gene clusters.

we also looked into the subnetwork within each cluster. figure  <dig> shows the local subnetwork corresponding to the first cluster which is involved mainly in cell division processes. two hub genes, tpx <dig> and ube2c, are in the central positions of this network. our finding that there are four gene clusters may suggest that the development of ovarian cancer could be partially driven by the cell cycle regulation, as well as the pathways related to cell shape and motility, and mitochondrial system. intervention  on the hub genes or other important genes may alter the entire network, therefore may control key aspects of disease development.subnetwork extracted from figure

survival-centric network prediction
we applied scbs and bayesian network model to construct a survival-centric network. in feature selection, we used continuous data to select genetic/epigenetic features that were most relevant to the overall survival time of ovarian cancer patients. starting from the first node , the scbs procedure selected  <dig> genes  and two methylation sites as the nodes in the bayesian network. interestingly only  <dig> genes including ccdc <dig>  mmp <dig>  slc family, tekt <dig>  wdr family and zmynd <dig> had been reported relevant to cancer survival in a separate study . the death risk  is then used as the phenotype node to build a phenotype-induced network. we defined the overall survival time for less than  <dig> years as the "high-risk"  and the survival time greater than  <dig> years as the "low-risk" . in our predicted graph, there are  <dig> hub genes  that drive corresponding local subnetworks including c2orf <dig>  fap, slc2a <dig>  laptm <dig>  cd <dig>  thbs <dig>  ccdc <dig>  slc17a, and lct. gene fap has a known function to control fibroblast growth or epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during development, tissue repair, and epithelial carcinogenesis  <cit> . the inferred bayesian network  identified two genes, namely psg <dig> and galnt <dig>  that may be directly associated with the overall survival time of ovarian cancer patients . both genes are functionally related to glycoprotein synthesis, as well as many other genes in the network such as slc2a <dig>  slc17a, cd <dig>  thbs <dig>  lct, gypa  <cit> . this indicates the biological pathway related to glycoprotein synthesis may be implicative of death risk of ovarian cancer patients. as reported in literature  <cit> , several tumor-associated glycoproteins were found on the surface of many cancer cells including ovary, breast, colon, and pancreatic cells and they may play potential roles in early detection of caners. one well-known such glycoprotein is ca- <dig> , which is the primary protein used to measure serous cancer tumor load, especially during recurrence, and it is heavily glycosylated  <cit> . pregnancy-specific glycoproteins  are mainly produced by the placental syncytiotrophoblasts during pregnancy and these proteins comprise a subgroup of the carcinoembryonic antigen family  <cit> . the protein encoded by gene galnt <dig> may have increased catalytic activity toward glycosylated peptides compared to activity toward non-glycosylated peptides  <cit> . as pointed out by several research groups  <cit> , some certain glycoproteins are closely associated with women cancers such as ovarian cancer and breast cancer, affecting the death risk, chemotherapy resistance and prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. the network also involves genes of other important functions including microtubules , extracelluar processes , hematopoietic , and human immune system . this network suggested many causal relationship between different features, some of which have been known, for example, the edge hotair →hoxc <dig> may be due to the fact that hotair  is located within the homeobox c  gene cluster and it regulates the expression of hox genes such as hoxc and hoxd  <cit> . <dig> survival-related genes

discussion
in this paper we proposed an integrative approach in the bayesian network framework for causal inference between genetic and epigenetic features in complex cancer data. it presents novelty in two aspects. first, we demonstrated that the stepwise correlation-based selection approach is more effective than simple single-round selection method in identifying important features in the genetic/epigenetic pathways, particularly those that are indirectly associated with the underlying phenotype. the method we proposed relies on the correlation strength among connected nodes and may fail when the connections are weak, especially for high-dimension data where assigning significance is challenging. using literature-verified genes as seeds helps to better select features relevant to the phenotype. the scbs procedure is model-free and computationally efficient and it can be applied to other graphical models such as markov random field  and gene-gene or protein-protein interaction  network problems.

second, we proposed a method for modeling causal relationships between features of different types  in a bayesian network through a logit link function. the block-wise coordinate descent  algorithm accompanied with the bayesian network model provides a simple and efficient way to estimate the parameters in the model. with a moderate sample size, this method achieves reasonable accuracy even for a moderate-scale network containing  <dig> nodes. this pipeline can be readily applied to other complex cancer data for pathway analysis or to find the common pathways between different but correlated phenotypes. for example, the tcga now has accumulated more than  <dig>  samples from breast cancer patients. it would be highly intriguing to know whether these two common diseases share any common molecular basis, especially for the basal-like breast cancer. as previously reported in literature  <cit> , the basal-like subtype of breast cancer is the most distinct of the four subtypes  and it is similar to high-grade serous ovarian cancer at the mrna expression level.

the bayesian network model allows strict probabilistic inference, but also has limitations. first, it lacks flexibility to model cyclic causal relationships. the bn cannot model any cyclic pathways, for example, a →b→c→a, which though may exist in gene regulation invivo. second, most of the existing bn learning algorithms assume sparsity for computational feasibility. if the true network is dense or locally dense , the weak causations may fail to be detected. our proposed bn with logit link function can model categorical variables and discretized continuous variables simultaneously, while discretization procedure may cause loss of information. a more desirable way could be to model the discrete variable nodes with logit distribution, but the continuous variable nodes with gaussian or other continuous distributions. this direction demands future research. the coordinate descent is successful in solving the lasso-type problem, especially in the sparse bn problem. due to the super-exponentially increased number of possible bns, the traditional sampling-based methods such as metropolis-hastings algorithm  is computational infeasible to estimate the network with moderate number of nodes, e.g.,  <dig> nodes. in our problem involving  <dig> nodes, the bcd algorithm took about  <dig> minutes on a single cpu to complete the estimation for a given penalizing parameter λ .

we illustrated the flexibility of this pipeline with two phenotypes, namely the ovarian cancer phenotype itself and the survival time of the cancer patient. the induced network by the cancer phenotype contains a set of  <dig> genes forming into four major clusters of distinct major functions, coordinated by  <dig> hub genes. some of the hub genes  have been reported by other researchers for their important roles in genetic pathways, while other genes  are newly discovered in this study. their functions in ovarian cancer need to be further investigated. our discovery that the mitochondrial systems are regulated in serous tumors is consistent with the hypothesis that the warburg effect impacts tumor progression as suggested in published studies . we also found that pathways related to glycoprotein synthesis, hematopoietic and immune systems correlate with the survival rate of ovarian cancer patients. in particular, we discovered that the two genes related to glycoprotein synthesis, psg <dig> and galnt <dig>  can significantly affect the overall survival time of ovarian cancer patients.

CONCLUSIONS
understanding the biological mechanism of ovarian cancer has significant practical importance for clinical diagnosis and treatment. timely advent of tcga project has provided the most comprehensive genomic data resource for cancer study at the molecular and system level. nevertheless, how to utilize these complex data for discovery of molecular mechanism of cancers remains one of the biggest challenges in this field. to this end, we propose a new integrative approach in this paper, which presents two innovations: a stepwise feature selection procedure and a bayesian network model that incorporates both continuous and discrete features for causal inference. the predicted graph for the ovarian cancer data confirmed numerous genetic pathways reported in the literature, as well as many new ones that may provide new clues to guide future research. the graph suggested  <dig> hub genes that may drive certain subnetworks therefore play important roles in ovarian cancer. clustering analysis suggested four gene clusters corresponding to distinct biological processes including cell division, tumor invasion and mitochondrial system. in addition, we found that genes related to glycoprotein synthesis, hematopoietic, immune system could be highly predictive of overall survival time of ovarian cancer patients.
