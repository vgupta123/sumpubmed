BACKGROUND
tiger beetles or cicindelids belong to the adephaga, a suborder of coleoptera that includes conspicuous, brightly coloured, non-pest species that are significant components of ecosystems, being important links in food chains. cicindelids are organisms that are commonly used as bioindicators, as their presence or absence can provide information on the quality, alterations and successional stage of habitats, and are considered to be good bioindicators of general biodiversity . there have been more than  <dig>  species of cicindelid beetles described  <cit> , which are distributed worldwide  and occupy a great diversity of habitats   <cit> . nevertheless, they do not show a homogenous pattern of distribution with relation to latitude or biogeography  <cit>  and species tend to specialise in particular habitats  <cit> . they have several mechanisms or adaptations to reduce competition and contribute to maintain species richness; seasonal temporal segregation , spatial segregation   <cit>  and temporal partitioning on the diel scale  have been previously studied as the most common strategies.

tiger beetles have been deeply studied at different levels:  morphology  <cit> ,  taxonomy ,  biology  <cit> ,  physiology  <cit> ,  thermoregulation  <cit> ,  evolution, ecology and diversity  <cit> ,  chromosome evolution  <cit>  and  conservation strategies  <cit> . nevertheless, the reproductive biology has not been studied, on physiological or molecular grounds, and little information on the transcriptome and gene expression related to physiological processes is available. the transcriptome analysis is an important tool to help identifying putative function of genes, translating the sequence of nucleotides in a sequence of amino acids, which is more likely to be conserved  <cit> . in addition, the availability of a variety of bioinformatics tools allows the characterisation of these genes  <cit> .

some studies show that proteins with high expression levels in male reproductive tissues and with characteristics that meet the criteria of extracellular secretion, are good candidates to be considered as seminal fluid proteins  . the seminal fluid of insects contains sperm and a complex mixture of proteins, inorganic solutes, carbohydrates and lipids that are transferred to females during mating via the spermatophore. these proteins, which are produced in male gonads , are important in the reproduction process by inducing physiological and behavioural changes in females, reducing responsiveness to other males, increasing the ovulation and egg laying rates, and altering feeding activity and also immune response .

the study of proteins transferred through the semen provides information for important biological questions such as the origin of new species and the origin of new molecules involved in sperm competition and coevolution between males and females . seminal fluid proteins have two characteristics that according to several theoretical models might lead to speciation. i) these proteins are related with sexual selection and sexual conflict and ii) the rapid evolutionary rate of these proteins may also contribute to the evolution of reproductive barriers between populations. furthermore, there is experimental evidences indicating a correlation between features that undergo the action of sexual selection and the speciation process .

in addition, several studies have demonstrated that many of these sfps have similar characteristics to those found in the taxonomically restricted genes , such as high evolutionary rate and low similarity between closely related species  <cit> . according to avila et al., the analysis of sfps provides insight into the evolutionary patterns of reproductive traits  <cit> . therefore, a better understanding of cicindelid reproductive molecules and their actions provides opportunities to reveal functionally conserved mechanism in cicindelids reproduction , as well as mechanisms involved in the reproductive isolation between species  as a subset of seminal proteins is among the most rapidly evolving proteins .

to date, several sfps have been described in insects, such as flies and mosquitoes , field crickets , honeybee , moths and butterflies  and in the beetle genus tribolium . apart from the polyphagan genus tribolium, which is considered a model organism, no other species of beetles have been analysed for these proteins.

the aim of this study was to identify and characterise genes encoding proteins that are transferred to females during mating through seminal fluids in cicindelids to contribute to the knowledge of the nature and function of insect sfps and particularly in this ecologically important group of adephagan beetles. to identify these proteins, est libraries from gonads and accessory glands of male calomera littoralis and cephalota litorea were made and bioinformatically analysed. proteins selected as candidate sfps were submitted to gene expression analysis in female and male tissues. the complete sequence of genes showing differential expression patterns was obtained and the prediction of the function was inferred either by comparing with other insects or based on the sequence properties. searches for homology of these putative sfp were performed in other cicidelid species. this work represents the first characterisation of putative sfp in adephagan beetles.

RESULTS
library construction and est assembly
two separate cdna libraries were constructed from rna extracted from reproductive tissues  of two males c. littoralis and one male of c. litorea. a total of  <dig>  est sequences were generated;  <dig> clones were sequenced from the c. littoralis library and  <dig> clones were sequenced from c. litorea. these sequences were trimmed for the removal of vector sequences and sequences < <dig> bp were excluded by seqman . est sequences with high quality were previously deposited in genbank under the following accession numbers: c. litorea  and c. littoralis . the high quality sequences of c. littoralis were assembled to  <dig> contigs  and  <dig> singletons , and c. litorea ests were assembled to  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. each cdna library had a minimum average inset size ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp in c. littoralis, and from  <dig> to  <dig>  in c. litorea library. the maximum number of ests that formed each contig was  <dig> ests in c. littoralis and  <dig> ests in c. litorea .table  <dig> summary of est analyses from c. littoralis and c. litorea male gonad cdna libraries

annotation – gene ontology
blast2go software showed that  <dig> contigs of c. litorea and  <dig> contigs of c. littoralis had no blast hits against the non-redundant protein database at national center for biotechnology information . the annotation of the  <dig> ests of c. litorea and  <dig> ests from c. littoralis were designated by database search algorithms blastx for proteins in the ncbi web server . additionally, gene ontology annotations of all contigs were performed using blast2go.table  <dig> summary of unigenes from c. littoralis and c. litorea male gonad analyses and annotated by blast2go software

annotated sequences were classified according to their gene ontology  into three categories: biological process, molecular function and cellular component . the proportions of genes associated with the different categories were highly similar among the two libraries; it is important to note that a sequence could be included in different categories and be associated to multiple go. within the category “cellular component”, the subcategories “cellular” and “organelle” were the most abundant in both libraries. however, the “extracellular” subcategory, where putative sfps should be included, was not present in the analysis performed, and no sequences were annotated as sfps. this could be due to both the low number of ests obtained in the cicindelid libraries and to the small number of coleopteran libraries available for comparisons.fig.  <dig> go term distribution in biological processes for c. littoralis and c. litorea gonad unigenes. percentages are in proportion to the total biological process go annotations

identification of putative sfps
nine genes putatively encoding sfps were identified in c. littoralis and five in c. litorea by indirect approaches . candidate genes were selected after detection of one or more of the following characteristics i) the presence of a computationally predicted signal peptide inferred via signal p  <dig>  software  <cit> , ii) its localisation as extracellular and/or with plasma membrane destination inferred via protcomp , iii) the recognition of a membrane helix inferred via tmhmm .table  <dig> summary of the characteristics present in the candidate genes

of the  <dig> candidates, it was only possible to design useful rt-pcr primers for  <dig> . tissue-specific expression patterns were obtained in the  <dig> available candidates. rt-pcr revealed strong amplification from the male abdomen but weak or not expression in female abdomens and male thoraxes in four of the genes . the positive control gene  amplified in all tissues . the identification of an extracellular component and the tissue-specific patterns of expression found in these four genes suggest that they encode seminal fluid proteins. the other eight candidate genes with an identified extracellular component did not show any differential expression; some studies have demonstrated that not all sfps have robust expression in male reproductive glands  <cit> , which could explain the low number of putative sfps characterised in the present survey.fig.  <dig> results from rt-pcr, showing the expected pattern of expression in the different tissues for the four putative sfps. arginine kinase gene was used as positive control and was amplified from cdna and rna  in all samples. ntc indicates negative template control



sfp characterisation
full length sequences and complete open reading frames  were obtained via rapid amplification of cdna ends pcr  for the four putative sfps. sizes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, which is in agreement with acps characterised in drosophila  <cit>  and references therein. sequences are available in genbank . two of these proteins  did not show any significant blastx similarity  against genbank proteins, and appear to be novel proteins . however, the protein acpc <dig> yielded a similarity close to  <dig> % with two seminal fluid proteins . this similarity, although low, may be a sign of the high evolutionary rates documented for some of these sfps . the proteins acpc <dig> and acpc <dig> showed similarity to sequences from drosophila yakuba and d. mojavensis, respectively, which have not yet been characterised. searches against several other insect genomes, run in flybase, yielded the same results.table  <dig> summary of the characterisation of cicindelids seminal fluid proteins

additionally, we tried to determine protein structure  using phyre protein fold recognition metaserver and protein domains using interproscan software. phyre did not yield consistent results for any of the genes tested. this approach, which proves the annotation in the tertiary structure of the proteins, was useful to annotate drosophila sfps  <cit> , suggesting that candidate cicindelid sfps do not meet the criteria found in drosophila, due to differences in the structure and/or function.

in the acpc <dig> gene, a single domain von willebrand factor type c  was detected via interproscan. svwc family proteins, which are largely present in arthropods, normally contain ten cysteines, and are thought to respond to environmental challenges, such as bacterial infection and nutritional status  <cit> . several studies have pointed out that sfps may be involved in the immune response, as mating processes can transfer numerous pathogens into the female tract, jeopardising the reproductive success. several sfps analysed in d. melanogaster seem to have direct antimicrobial activity, protecting the male and subsequently the female reproductive tracts and even eggs against bacterial infection  <cit>  and/or stimulation of antimicrobial gene expression levels  <cit> . other putative sfps have been identified in other diptera, such as a. aegypti and a. gambiae  <cit> , which are related to immune response. in coleoptera, south et al. identified a putative sfp in tribolium which is a predicted prophenoloxidase, an important component of the innate immune response in arthropoda  <cit> . however, protfun identifies acpc <dig> as a hormone. this result could be in accordance with protein classes that are found in seminal proteins in different animals. wolfner stated in her work that  <dig> % of accessory gland proteins appear to be peptide hormones or prohormones  <cit> , and in drosophila melanogaster acp26aa sfp was found to have similarity with califin c, a hormone from aplysia californica  <cit>  which is involved in the egg-laying process  <cit> . this could be an example of how a function assignment based on the sequence and structure similarity  could actually be different from a function assignment based not only on the structure but also on the physical/chemical and functional biological properties . in other words, a conserved structure of a protein does not ensure a conserved function  <cit> .

finally, analysis with protfun identified the gene acpc <dig> to be an immune response protein. the other analyses did not assign a function to this protein based on similarity searches. however, protfun analysis based on amino acid-derived input features did identify a function for this protein. this could be explained when considering the acpc01gene as a novel putative sfp class that is either present only in tiger beetles  or has not yet been characterised in other insects. the protein acpc <dig> was identified as a transcription regulation factor by protfun and also has similarities in flybase and genbank with a non-characterised protein in d. mojavensis. although transcription regulation factors are not included within the described protein classes of sfp across animals  <cit> , acpc <dig> meets the requirements to be considered an sfp; therefore, further genetic studies may corroborate the biological function of this protein in tiger beetles. a similar consideration can be made in relation to the protein acpc <dig>  which according to the ontogenetic categories, is considered to be a growth factor by protfun, although in this case, no homology has been found in the databases.

homology in cicindelid species
rt-pcr and race-pcr primers were used in an attempt to amplify homologous sequences in the available cicindelid species . the acpc <dig> gene, found originally in c. litorea, yielded homologous sequences in male abdomens of all of the analysed species . this result is not surprising considering that although sfp are considered to have high evolutionary rate and low similarity between closely related species  <cit> , not all sfps evolve rapidly and some loci are conserved between divergent taxa  <cit> . in this line of evidence, acpc <dig> showed clear amplification in c. litorea, c. littoralis, l. flexuosa and c. deserticoloides, although weak signal in c. trisignata and no signal at all in c. maura. this result is coherent with the phylogenetic relationships obtained using cytochrome oxidase i gene   with the cicindelid species under study . in fact c. maura is the most distantly related species.fig.  <dig> results of the sfps homology searches. rt-pcr and race-pcr primers were used to amplify the four putative sfps in six cicindelid species. arginine kinase gene was used as positive control and was amplified from cdna and rna  in all samples. ntc indicates negative template control

fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree based on coi sequences  from the cicindelids species analysed



however, acpc <dig> showed amplification only in male abdomens of l. flexuosa . the phylogenetic tree  showed that c. littoralis and l. flexuosa are closely related species. this close relationship could explain why these putative sfps obtained from c. littoralis were also found in l. flexuosa. the lack of amplification in the other cicindelid species tested might be interpreted as a consequence of the rapid evolution that is generally considered for sfps . acpc <dig> showed amplification in c. littoralis and c. deserticoloides with the race-pcr primers, but using the rt-pcr primers only c. littoralis gave positive results. however the detection of this gene in these two species suggest that it might be present in the most recent common ancestor of these two species, although with the primer pairs used was not detected.

CONCLUSIONS
two cdna libraries were constructed from gonads of c. littoralis and c. litorea as a foundation to understanding the male reproductive system. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> ests were sequenced and analysed, assembled in  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes, respectively. also,  <dig> and  <dig> contigs were annotated via blast2go and no sfps were found. we have identified  <dig> putative sfps by bioinformatics analysis and found that four of them met the criteria of tissue-specific expression patterns, which led to them being considered as putative sfp. functional annotation was difficult due to the fact that the four sfps either do not show homology via similarity searches or reassemble with sequences whose function is unknown; only interpro assigns a function in the immune response for acpc <dig>  as occurs with others insect sfps. the predicted assignment of function via protfun for acpc <dig> and acpc <dig> was immune response and hormone, respectively; these protein functions are included within the conserved protein classes of sfps that have already been reported in several insect species. searches for homology in other cicindelids showed that acpc <dig> is only present in c. littoralis and lophyra flexuosa, species which have a close phylogenetic relationship. sfps are among the most rapidly evolving proteins and therefore this new putative spf might represent a linage-specific sfp involved in reproductive isolation between species. in contrast, acpc <dig> is present in all cicindelid species analysed here, and could be an example of a highly conserved sfp, at least in tiger beetles. the same can be said about acpc <dig>  with is present in all species tested except for the most distantly related species c. maura. this work represents the first identification of putative sfps in tiger beetles that are one of the best studied worldwide distributed non-pest insects , are important in ecosystems as predators and are commonly used as bioindicators. the identification of cicindelid sfps  could represent a significant approach for understanding the male reproductive system in cicindelids and furthermore the species richness and adaptive evolution in adephagan beetles.
