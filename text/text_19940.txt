BACKGROUND
brucellosis, recognized as a common zoonotic disease globally, is caused by bacteria of the genus brucella. b. melitensis, b. abortus, and b. suis remain the principal causes of human brucellosis worldwide and are major public health problems, primarily in africa, the middle east and southeast asia  <cit> . brucellosis is prevalent in china, especially in the northern china, where people are economically dependent on ruminant livestock. approximately  <dig>  human cases are reported annually over the past  <dig> years  <cit> . in china, b. melitensis was the predominant strain associated with human brucellosis outbreaks, according to annual report on surveillance of selected infectious disease and vector. species identification and subtyping of brucella isolates is very important for epidemiologic surveillance and investigation of outbreaks in brucella-endemic regions  <cit> .

recent studies have confirmed that multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis  is a useful tool for identifying and genotyping brucella strains and the resultant data can be used for epidemiological trace-back investigations  <cit> . in efforts to better improve surveillance and evaluate the power of epidemiological trace-back in china, the mlva- <dig> scheme was used to type a collection of  <dig> b. melitensis isolates from  <dig> different regions throughout china.



RESULTS
typing and clustering of b. melitensis isolates by mlva-16
using the complete mlva- <dig> assay , the  <dig> b. melitensis isolates were clustered in  <dig> different genotypes with  <dig> clusters and  <dig> singleton genotypes . the corresponding diversity index for panels  <dig>  2a, and 2b were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively. the overall discriminatory index of mlva- <dig> in this population was  <dig> . using panel  <dig>  the present population clustered into five known genotypes and a new genotype. the five known genotypes were included in the previously named the 'east mediterranean' group with genotypes  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all were included in the previously recognized 'east mediterranean' group. two strains from guangdong, isolated in  <dig>  had the genotype , labeled as cn- <dig>  the two strains were a single-locus variant  to genotype  <dig>  to date the genotype associated with cn- <dig> has not been reported from any other country.

greater diversity among the chinese b. melitensis isolates was apparent when the eight additional markers encompassing panel 2a and 2b were included. the number of strains populating a cluster ranged from two  to six. clusters comprised of two strains were as follows: mlva type <dig> , mlva type <dig> , mlva type <dig> , mlva type <dig> , mlva type <dig> , mlva type <dig> , mlva type <dig>  and mlva type <dig> . clusters comprised of three strains were as follows: mlva type <dig> , mlva type <dig>  and mlva type <dig> . clusters comprised of four strains were as follows: mlva type <dig> , mlva type <dig>  and mlva type <dig> . clusters comprised of five strains were as follows: mlva type <dig>  and mlva type <dig>  cluster comprised of six strains was mlva type <dig> . based upon the year of isolation, it is evident that many of the genotypes identified using mlva- <dig> appear to have persisted for a long time in china and may be associated with spread of the strains from northern to southern china; more data will need to be collected to re-enforce these observations. the most discriminatory markers were bruce <dig> and bruce <dig> of panel 2b, with a diversity index of >  <dig>  harboring  <dig> and  <dig> alleles, respectively. the most homogeneous markers, in contrast, were bruce <dig>  bruce <dig>  bruce <dig>  bruce <dig>  bruce <dig>  bruce <dig> and bruce <dig> of panel  <dig> and panel 2a. the main characteristics of the  <dig> loci in the  <dig> b. melitensis strains are shown in table  <dig> 

analysis of the isolates from inner mongolia and guangdong
using the complete mlva- <dig> assay, the  <dig> b. melitensis isolates from inner mongolia and  <dig> isolates from guangdong were clustered in  <dig> and  <dig> different genotypes, respectively. the bruce <dig> loci had  <dig> and  <dig> alleles and the bruce <dig> loci had  <dig> and  <dig> alleles in these two population.  <dig> genotypes of  <dig> isolates from inner mongolia and  <dig> genotypes of  <dig> isolates from guangdong isolates were single-locus or double locus variants of the main subgroups at 90% similarity. only two of the clusters consisted of epidemiologically related strains exclusively from the same province and the same time. bru <dig> and bru <dig> isolates came from a married couple who contacted with sheep fetuses and placenta in may,  <dig> from bai country, xilinguole, inner mongolia. bru <dig>  br <dig>  bru <dig> and bru <dig> isolates were collected over six weeks from late april to early june,  <dig>  in pingsha county, zhuhai city, guangdong province. these four patients had not identified at-risk occupational history and experienced fever, debility and joint pains.

trace-back of a laboratory-acquired brucella infection
we report a case of brucellosis affecting a hospital microbiology laboratory technician in beijing, a non-endemic area of china. to better elucidate the origin of such infection, brucella strains from both the patient and the laboratory technician were characterized by mlva- <dig>  the strain bj06- <dig> showed the same mlva type with strain nm06- <dig> isolated from a patient with acute brucellosis who engaged in fur-making in inner mongolia.

identification of the b. melitensis vaccine strain m5
lb10- <dig>  a b. melitensis biovar  <dig> strain isolated from guangdong in  <dig> was indistinguishable from the vaccine strain m <dig> according to the mlva cluster analysis . this is unexpected since the vaccine strain m <dig> was not used in guangdong. detection of a strain with phenotypic and genotypic properties indistinguishable from the vaccine strain m <dig> raises the concern of the origin of the wild type strain.

discussion
brucellosis surveillance was started in  <dig> in some parts of china. in  <dig>   <dig> surveillance points for animal and human brucellosis were established in the  <dig> provinces of heilongjiang, jilin, hebei, henan, inner mongolia, shandong, guangdong, guangxi, sichuan, tibet, gansu, ningxia, xinjiang, shanxi, shan'xi, zhejiang, liaoning, ningxia and yunnan. since the established of these surveillance points more than  <dig> years ago, a huge panel of animals and humans strains have been surveyed. it is significant that the national epidemiological characteristics can be analyzed. it suggests that b. melitensis isolates from different locations and years would reflect the epidemic features of human brucellosis.

sheep infected with brucella are one of the main sources for human and animal brucellosis in china  <cit> . over the last  <dig> years, the geographic distribution of brucellosis in china had been changing from pasturing areas to regions of with reduced agricultural interests ; in these areas the infection rates, reported incidence, and number of outbreaks of brucellosis have increased markedly based on the national notifiable disease surveillance system data. during this period, the cases have mostly been reported from inner mongolia, shanxi, hebei, shandong, henan, liaoning, jilin, heilongjiang, and shan'xi provinces. it is worth noting that brucellosis is endemic in guangdong province, one of the wealthiest and industrial provinces in china. this is because of the movement of infected animal to guangdong, resulting in the change of the geographic distribution of brucellosis.

in the different epidemic regions of china, the predominant strains have been shown to be b. melitensis biovar  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  <cit> . since  <dig>  most human cases in china have been caused by b. melitensis biovar  <dig>  <cit> . classical typing systems are unable to subdivide brucella isolates below the biovar level. molecular typing methods such as mlva have been utilized to distinguish between strains of the same biovar in both animal and human isolates  <cit> . in an effort to assess the value of mlva as a subtyping tool for brucella strains, genotypic characteristics of  <dig> b. melitensis isolates were investigated. cluster analysis of these china strains, based on the eight variable-nucleotide tandem repeat loci included in the mlva- <dig> panel  <dig> grouped them all into the b. melitensis 'east mediterranean group'  <cit>  and unique from circulating strains in northern africa, southern europe . for instance, an  clustered separately from most of the other 'west mediterranean group'  and 'american group'. previous studies have shown that near eastern countries frequently report human cases associated with genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . genotype  <dig>  as we have shown, is widely distributed throughout china, and has previously been reported to be predominant in turkey, portugal and spain  <cit> . in spain, human b. melitensis strains clustered into genotypes  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> . chinese b. melitensis are classified in limited number of closely related genotypes showing variation mainly at the panel 2b loci.

in china, the inner mongolia autonomous region is the most severe endemic focus of brucellosis, with an annual incidence of the disease varying from  <dig> to 70/ <dig>  during 2005- <dig>  <cit> . inner mongolia is in close proximity to heilongjiang, jilin, hebei and shanxi provinces; these provinces are located in the north and east of china, where stocking raising is the most important aspect of the economy. in these regions, b. melitensis genotype  <dig> strains were predominant, but genotype  <dig> strains were also common in provinces reporting sporadic cases such as liaoning, shandong, zhejiang, fujian and tianjin. these isolates were only single-locus or double-locus variants of b. melitensis from the endemic regions. of particular note is the apparently stability of genotype  <dig> in china; genotype  <dig> strains were isolated from inner mongolia in <dig> as well as  <dig> years later.

guangdong province, which is now considered to be an endemic region for brucellosis, is located in the southern coastal region of china, where the incidence of human brucellosis has increased gradually since  <dig>  the prevailing panel  <dig> type is genotype  <dig> as well. the genotypes for most of the b. melitensis isolates in this series and their close relatedness by mlva  compared to the relatedness of b. melitensis isolates in other countries reflects microevolution within the regionally important strain due to a few mutational events  <cit> . we also observed that strains from the north and east of china  had the same mlva- <dig> genotype  as those from the south of china . this data indicates that the emergence of brucellosis in the south of china is likely to have its origins from the importation of animals from elsewhere in china. the clustering of epidemiologically-related isolates identified in the current and previous studies support the use of mlva- <dig> as a valuable tool for investigations of outbreaks of both human and animal brucellosis. in our study, only  <dig> of  <dig> isolates  had mlva- <dig> genotype  <dig>  it is likely that these cases represented a common-source outbreak or infected the herds of the same genotype. because consistent epidemiological information for the strains is not routinely available, it is impossible to assess the relationship of the cluster results for these data and outbreaks. an urgent integrated, laboratory-based surveillance is needed to address this important public health gap.

to facilitate outbreak investigation, it has been recommended to use an abbreviated mlva scheme, omitting testing with panel  <dig> and 2a since panel 2b is highly polymorphic and potentially more discriminating in determining genetic relationships in regions of endemicity  <cit> . some apparently unlinked  isolates had identical mlva- <dig> profiles also. this led us to hypothesize that these may represent either epidemiologically unrelated isolates with homoplasy at mlva- <dig> loci  or persistent circulating strains causing sporadic infections  <cit> . more detailed genetic investigations such as whole genome sequence comparison, should clarify these relationships.

results of genotyping confirmed a laboratory-acquired brucella infection. laboratory workers who handle infected specimens are at high risk of acquiring brucella infection, as suggested by the numerous cases of laboratory-acquired brucellosis reported in the literature  <cit> . we report a case of brucellosis affecting a hospital microbiology laboratory technician in beijing, a non-endemic area of china.

human infection with the vaccine strain m <dig> in china has not been reported. however, in the previous reports, strains were only biotyped using conventional methods and no direct molecular linkage was shown between the isolated and commercial m <dig> vaccine strain. in this study, lb 10- <dig> has the identical genotype with m <dig>  this suggests that lb 10- <dig> might be that a wild-type biovar  <dig> evolved with a pattern identical to m <dig> or that the original strain from which m <dig> was developed still is transmitted. results obtained by garcia-yoldi et al. confirmed b. melitensis vaccine strain rev  <dig> group as assayed by mlva is genetically very homogeneous  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the mlva assay is very promising to be used as a simple molecular tool for genotypes distribution of brucella isolates from an endemic region, and might be useful for trace back investigations in non-endemic areas.
