BACKGROUND
the solanaceae is a large plant family comprised of over  <dig> species including many important crops such as tomato, potato, eggplant, and pepper. it represents a group of dicotyledonous plants in the euasterid clade, which is divergent from the model plant arabidopsis  <cit> . it is the third economically important plant family and ranks the first in terms of vegetable crops. the related family rubiaceae contains coffee: one of the most valuable agricultural commodities in the international trade. unlike some other plant families , the solanaceae and the rubiaceae have evolved largely in the absence of polyploidization  <cit> . for instance, tomato, eggplant and pepper have the same basic chromosome number  and share similar chromosome architecture with pericentric heterochromatin and more distal euchromatic arms. cultivated potato and tobacco are tetraploid but the events occurred relatively recently and many diploid species can still be found in the wild. coffee also has a similar chromosome architecture and dna content, and has a chromosome number of 2n =  <dig>  as a result, the solanaceae and related taxa present a unique opportunity to study genome/gene evolution in the absence of recent polyploidization events.

in the past two decades, extensive pairwise comparative mapping studies have been performed for several major solanaceous crops relative to tomato  <cit> . however, no comparisons of multiple species have been conducted to decipher the overall patterns of chromosomal evolution in this family. recently, wu et al  <cit>  developed a set of  <dig> single-copy conserved ortholog set  markers of which  <dig> have been mapped in the tomato genome http://sgn.cornell.edu/cview/map.pl?map_id=9&show_offsets=1&show_ruler= <dig>  subsequently, cosii genetic maps have been constructed for eggplant, pepper and two diploid nicotiana species, and pairwise comparisons have been reported between each species and tomato  <cit> . potato, a close taxonomic relative of tomato, was also included in this series of comparisons  <cit> . these previous comparative mapping studies have established the syntenic relationships between the  <dig> tomato chromosomes  and those of potato , eggplant , pepper  and nicotiana . the nicotiana map used in this work is a deduced map for the diploid ancestor of n. tomentosiformis and n. acuminata  based on comparisons of these two species and tomato  <cit> . the deduced map of the ancestral nicotiana species excludes inversions that occurred subsequent to the divergence of n. tomentosiformis and n. acuminata.

previous comparative mapping studies across solanaceous species have revealed that inversions have been the most common cause of genome rearrangements--with translocations occurring at a lower frequency. tomato and potato differ by  <dig> inversions  <cit> . tomato and eggplant differ by  <dig> inversions and  <dig> translocations  <cit> . tomato and pepper differ by  <dig> inversions and  <dig> translocations  <cit> . tomato and nicotiana differ by a minimum of  <dig> inversions and  <dig> translocations, although the number of inversions is likely underestimated due to the large evolutionary distance between tomato and nicotiana  <cit> . in the current study we performed multiple-species comparisons in order to estimate the timing of these chromosomal rearrangement events, deduce the genome arrangement of the most recent common ancestors  of these species, and compare the rates of chromosomal evolution across different lineages. we also compared these results for the solanaceae with similar studies in other plant and animal families.

methods
estimating divergence time for species in the family solanaceae
wu et al  <cit>  published a phylogenetic tree of solanaceous species with strong statistical support  based on concatenated exons of  <dig> cosii markers. using the same dataset and the same method, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree rooted with coffee . subsequently, we ran the program r8s  <cit>  to estimate the age of internal nodes by the non-parametric rate smoothing  method, which does not rely on the assumption of a molecular clock  <cit> . the calibration point was tomato-coffee split at  <dig> ~  <dig> million years ago , and 86mya was used for calculation  <cit> . additional file  <dig> presents the complete result from this analysis and figure  <dig> only includes the species used for the current study.

comparing the maps of multiple solanaceous species
as a starting point, we utilized previously published comparisons of tomato and each of the other solanaceous species included in this current study--potato  <cit> , eggplant  <cit> , pepper  <cit>  and nicotiana  <cit> . the tomato genetic map has the largest number of markers, including all the orthologous markers employed in these pairwise comparisons  <cit> ; however, different subsets  were mapped in each of the other species being compared--making it difficult to perform direct comparisons between non-tomato species . using the principle of parsimony, we applied the following rules to overcome these difficulties. for any genomic region being compared, if a pair of non-tomato species was determined to have the same gene order as tomato, we considered that the pair of non-tomato species also shared the same gene order with respect to each other in this particular region . if on the other hand, each of the non-tomato species differed from tomato by an inversion corresponding to the same region of the tomato genome, we considered that the pair of non-tomato species had the same gene order and the inversion was derived along the tomato lineage . however, in the situation shown in figure 2c, we considered that species  <dig> and  <dig> each had an independent inversion relative to tomato even though the two inverted regions overlapped with each other. lower breakpoint of the inversion between species  <dig> and tomato was located between markers "g" and "h" on the tomato map while that between species  <dig> and tomato was between markers "e" and "g", in other words, the two breakpoints were different and therefore they must have been resulted from two independent events. for translocations , if the breakpoint region of the translocation between species  <dig> and tomato  overlapped with that between species  <dig> and tomato , we considered that the two species possibly shared the same breakpoint and presumably the breakpoint region could be narrowed down to the overlapping region.

deducing the genome arrangement of ancestral species
we employed the principle of parsimony to deduce the genome arrangement of three ancestral species--atpt, ate and atp . if tomato and potato shared the same genome arrangement, they both likely preserved the arrangement of atpt. if tomato and potato differed from each other, the species, which shared the same arrangement with any of the more distant species--eggplant, pepper and nicotiana, would be considered to preserve the arrangement of atpt while the other one had the derived condition. using the same method, we compared atpt and eggplant  to decide which one or both preserved the arrangement of ate, and again we compared ate and pepper  to decide which one or both preserved the arrangement of atp.

RESULTS
phylogenetic relationships of the studied solanaceous species and the estimated age of their most recent common ancestors 
the phylogenetic relationships of species in the family solanaceae have been studied using both plastid and nuclear sequences  <cit> . among the solanaceous species included in the current study, tomato, potato and eggplant belong to the genus solanum, with tomato and potato closer to each other than to eggplant. pepper is a member of the genus capsicum. nicotiana is the most distant and basal to the other two genera . molecular dating  suggested  <dig> mya for the age of the mrca of tomato and potato ,  <dig> mya for that of the mrca of tomato, potato and eggplant ,  <dig> mya for that of the mrca of tomato, potato, eggplant and pepper , and  <dig> mya for that of the mrca of tomato, potato, eggplant, pepper and nicotiana . these estimates are similar to those reported from recent studies  <cit> .

inferring the arrangement of mrca genomes
the tomato genetic map was used as standard in this work since it shared the most orthologous markers with the maps of potato, eggplant, pepper and nicotiana. after these species diverged from their common ancestors with tomato, numerous translocations have reshuffled the ancestral  <dig> chromosomes so that there is not always a 1: <dig> correspondence for the orthologous chromosomes among these species . to facilitate the following analyses, we divided the  <dig> chromosomes in eggplant, pepper and nicotiana into segments according to their translocations relative to tomato . for example, eggplant e <dig> combined segments from tomato t <dig> and t <dig> respectively and thus was divided into segments e4a and e4b .

the first step in the multiple-species comparisons was to depict the translocations and inversions in potato, eggplant, pepper and nicotiana with respect to tomato . based on the phylogenetic relationships among these species and the principle of parsimony, in most cases it was feasible to determine along which lineage a rearrangement event occurred and to deduce the putative genome arrangement of the ancestral genomes . the genome arrangement of atn requires a more distant species  to determine and thus will not be included in the follow-up analyses. chromosomes of the ancestral genomes were named 1- <dig> according to the tomato orthologs. in the following paragraphs, we will describe these rearrangements chromosome by chromosome .

t <dig> and its orthologs
t <dig> and pt <dig> share the same gene order and gene content so that they both represent the ancestral arrangement in atpt <dig>  e <dig> differs from atpt <dig> by one inversion, which is not seen in pepper and nicotiana, therefore ate <dig> has a similar arrangement to atpt <dig> and the inversion is derived in e <dig>  the pepper ortholog is p1b, part of a large chromosome p <dig> , which indicates a translocation between pepper and ate genomes. p1b is further differentiated from ate <dig> by at least two paracentric and two pericentric inversions. nonetheless, genome arrangement of the ancestral atp <dig> can only be partly determined with the more distant nicotiana. on one hand, the translocation combining p1b and p1a does not exist in the nicotiana genome, suggesting that translocation is specific to the pepper genome. on the other hand, the two translocations differentiating nicotiana from atp, which produced n11c, n9b and n1a, has made it difficult to identify whether ate <dig> or p1b shares the same gene order with nicotiana and thus the four inversions could have occurred along the lineage of either ate or pepper.

t <dig> and its orthologs
this chromosome is the only one that has not experienced translocations along any of the five lineages. pt <dig> and e <dig> share an inversion relative to t <dig>  therefore pt <dig> represents the ancestral arrangement in atpt <dig>  e <dig> differs from atpt <dig> by two inversions, which are not seen in p <dig>  therefore ate <dig> resembles atpt <dig>  p <dig> and ate <dig> are differentiated by two inversions. n <dig> appears to share the same gene order with t2; however, some inversions between nicotiana and tomato may have not been identified because multiple sequential rearrangements after their divergence may have greatly shuffled the marker order. as a result, we cannot ascertain whether ate <dig> or p <dig> or neither has preserved the ancestral condition. therefore in this work we used nicotiana to time the translocations but not inversions. exceptions will be described case by case.

t <dig> and its orthologs
t <dig> agrees with pt <dig> in both gene order and gene content and thus both have preserved the ancestral arrangement in atpt <dig>  e <dig> is differentiated from atpt <dig> by at least two inversions and one translocation that inserted a t <dig> segment  between e3a and e3c. these arrangements are not seen in either pepper or nicotiana, therefore ate <dig> likely has a similar structure to atpt <dig>  pepper  differs from ate <dig> by two inversions and one translocation. again, the two inversions cannot be timed with nicotiana due to the reason described earlier. the nicotiana orthologous counterparts are n9c and n3b--a different karyotype  from both pepper and ate <dig>  therefore nicotiana is not helpful in timing this translocation between pepper and ate <dig>  nonetheless, the breakpoint regions in pepper and nicotiana overlap with each other, suggesting they may share the same breakpoint. in other words, the breakpoint may have been reused in different lineages and at different points in time.

t <dig> and its orthologs
t <dig> and pt <dig> share the same gene order and gene content and thus both may represent the ancestral arrangement in atpt <dig>  e11b has three derived inversions. pepper  likely experienced a translocation that separated p5a from the rest of the chromosome since the same translocation was not found in nicotiana. p5a also differs from ate <dig> by an inversion but the timing is unknown. however, distinct karyotypes among atpt, eggplant, pepper and nicotiana make it impossible to determine which lineage  or none of them has preserved the ancestral karyotype in ate and atp, although the gene order in these chromosome segments may largely be consistent with that of atpt <dig> and the breakpoint may have been reused .

t <dig> and its orthologs
pt <dig>  e3b and p11a share one inversion relative to t <dig>  so that pt <dig> has preserved the arrangement in atpt <dig> and the inversion is derived in t <dig>  eggplant experienced a translocation and multiple inversions that resulted in e3b and e10a; therefore ate <dig> has a similar gene order to atpt <dig>  both pepper and nicotiana differ from ate <dig> by one inversion, so that pepper may have preserved the ancestral gene order in the atp genome. eggplant , pepper  and nicotiana  possibly share the breakpoint of one translocation relative to atpt <dig>  but karyotype of the ate and atp genomes cannot be determined.

t <dig> and its orthologs
both t <dig> and pt <dig> have preserved the ancestral arrangement in atpt <dig>  e <dig> and p <dig> share one inversion relative to atpt <dig> near top of the chromosome, and e <dig> and n6b share another inversion relative to atpt <dig> near bottom of the chromosome. therefore both ate <dig> and atp <dig> resemble e <dig> while two inversions occurred to atpt <dig> and one to p <dig> 

t <dig> and its orthologs
this chromosome is quite conserved. e <dig> has a derived inversion, otherwise t <dig>  pt <dig>  e <dig> and p <dig> share the same gene order and gene content. therefore, the genome arrangement in atpt <dig>  ate <dig> and atp <dig> resemble that in t7/pt7/p <dig> 

t <dig> and its orthologs
this chromosome is also fairly conserved. t <dig>  pt <dig> and e <dig> agree with each other in both gene order and gene content, therefore the genome arrangement in atpt <dig> and ate <dig> have been well preserved. as described in the previous section "t <dig> and its orthologs", pepper differs from the above three species by one translocation which is not seen in nicotiana, therefore this translocation is likely derived in the pepper genome and atp <dig> resembles ate <dig> 

t <dig> and its orthologs
one inversion differentiates t <dig> from pt <dig>  e <dig> and p9a, suggesting atpt <dig> and ate <dig> resemble pt9/e <dig> and the gene order in atp <dig> is likely the same as that in pt9/e <dig>  pepper  has a translocation relative to ate <dig>  with the breakpoint likely shared by nicotiana , but timing of the translocation and karyotype of the atp genome remain to be determined.

t <dig> and its orthologs
this chromosome is conserved among t <dig>  pt <dig> and p <dig> except for a derived inversion in t <dig>  therefore atpt <dig>  ate <dig> and atp <dig> have a similar arrangement to pt10/p <dig>  eggplant has a quite different situation in that it experienced multiple rearrangements including one translocation and five inversions.

t <dig> and its orthologs
pt <dig> is differentiated from t <dig> by one inversion, which is not seen in the other species, so atpt <dig> resembles t <dig>  eggplant  and pepper  share two inversions relative to atpt <dig>  therefore the inversions are derived in atpt <dig>  pepper has one additional inversion but its timing cannot be determined. eggplant, pepper and nicotiana share the breakpoint of a translocation relative to tomato, but again the timing of this translocation is unknown.

t <dig> and its orthologs
t <dig> has an inversion relative to pt <dig> but shares the same gene order with the pepper orthologous counterparts, therefore t <dig> has preserved the genome arrangement of atpt <dig>  eggplant  and pepper  each have experienced two translocations and one inversion relative to atpt <dig>  although these rearrangements are independent of each other. the translocation that produced e12a and the inversion on e10b are derived in eggplant, so ate <dig> has a similar gene order to atpt <dig>  the translocation that separated p9b and p3b is derived on pepper. the inversion between p12c and t <dig> has an unknown timing. the other two translocations, which separated e10b and e5b as well as p3b and p12c, share a common breakpoint with nicotiana  but their timing cannot be determined.

rates of inversion and translocation events across the solanaceae
comparing the genetic maps of tomato, potato, eggplant, pepper and nicotiana has permitted us, in many instances, to deduce the genome arrangement of their mrcas and to determine in which lineage chromosomal rearrangements occurred. as a result, we present actual genetic maps of the extant species and deduced genetic maps of their mrcas according to their phylogenetic relationships, and depict the possible inversion and translocation events that occurred leading to each genome . in summary, since these species diverged from their last mrca, four inversions have occurred along the tomato lineage, two inversions along the potato lineage, four inversions along the atpt lineage,  <dig> inversions along the eggplant lineage, and at least one inversion along each of ate and pepper lineages as well as  <dig> undetermined inversions between these two lineages. the situation for translocations is more complicated. since eggplant diverged from ate, a t <dig> segment was inserted into e <dig>  a t <dig> segment was inserted into e <dig>  and markers from t <dig> was translocated to e <dig> and e <dig> respectively. since pepper diverged from atp, a non-reciprocal translocation resulted in p <dig> and p <dig>  a small t <dig> segment was inserted into p <dig>  and a small t <dig> segment was inserted into p <dig>  in addition to these events with known timing, chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been rearranged by translocations in the atpt and/or eggplant genomes after they diverged from the ate genome, and chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been rearranged by translocations in the ate and/or pepper genomes after they diverged from the atp genome.

using the divergence time estimated earlier, we calculated the absolute rates of inversions and translocations respectively across different lineages . after divergence from atpt, the lineages leading to tomato and potato experienced  <dig>  and  <dig>  inversions/million years respectively. after divergence from ate, the lineage leading to eggplant experienced  <dig> inversion/million years and  <dig>  ~  <dig>  translocations/million years. after divergence from atp, the lineage leading to pepper experienced  <dig>  ~  <dig>  inversions/million years and  <dig>  ~  <dig>  translocations/million years. these results suggested a fairly consistent rate of chromosomal rearrangements across these solanaceous species. one exception is that the eggplant lineage appears to have experienced a higher number of inversions. one possible explanation for this observation is that some inversions between atpt and eggplant/pepper cannot be deciphered between atpt and pepper due to larger evolutionary distance and thus the inversions were assigned into the eggplant lineage. this same factor may also lead to an underestimate of the inversion number between ate and pepper. nonetheless, these results provide the first general outline of the chromosomal evolution in the solanaceae.

discussion
evaluation of the parsimony analyses
given the phylogenetic relationships of the solanaceous species included in this study , we performed parsimony analyses to determine the timing of rearrangement events that differentiate these species. the results from this study can be used to highlight a number of points. first, multiple distant species are necessary for timing inversions between a pair of sister species. for example, regarding the inversion between t <dig> and pt <dig> , eggplant experienced a translocation in this region which moved some markers to e <dig> so that it was hard to determine with either tomato or potato eggplant shared the same gene order. nonetheless, pepper showed clear agreement with potato, thus supporting potato preserved the ancestral condition. secondly, species with large phylogenetic distance may not be good for timing inversions. nicotiana is the most distant from the other species but appears to differ from tomato by  <dig> inversions only, possibly because multiple sequential rearrangements shuffled the marker order to the extent that individual inversions can no longer be deciphered  <cit> . among these  <dig> inversions, only three were shared by the other species and thus were useful for determining the time of these events. as a result, we left  <dig> of the inversions between ate and pepper as events with unknown timing. pepper, in some cases, may also be too distant to time the inversions between atpt and eggplant, thus a higher inversion rate was estimated along the eggplant lineage, although some of the inversions may actually have occurred along the atpt lineage or more anciently before the divergence of atpt and eggplant. thirdly, more species are in need to decipher the timing of translocation events. in more than half of the identified translocations , the species being compared each have a different karyotype  and thus we could not assign these events into a specific lineage or deduce the ancestral chromosome arrangement. one possible solution is to construct genetic maps and comparative maps of more solanaceous species within the phylogenetic distance between tomato and nicotiana.

possible reuse of chromosomal breakpoints for independent translocation events
among all the identified translocations differentiating the solanaceous species studied, we found that some events have overlapping breakpoint regions, e.g. the two independent translocations relative to t <dig>  which produced p4a and p3c for pepper and n9c and n3b for nicotiana respectively . however, since resolution of the breakpoint regions is limited by the density of synteny markers, we cannot ascertain whether the breakpoints are in the exact same position. similar cases were found for the translocation events relative to t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> . such phenomenon--reuse of breakpoints, has been reported as a common phenomenon in mammals  <cit> . pevzner and tesler  <cit>  described mammalian genomes as mosaics of rearrangement hotspots and conserved segments, and proposed a fragile breakage model which was opposed to the widely accepted random breakage theory by nadeau and taylor  <cit> . it was reported that ~20% of breakpoint regions were reused during mammalian evolution and the sites were enriched for centromeres  <cit> . interestingly and consistently, five out of the six cases in our finding  also had breakpoints near the predicted position of the tomato centromere .

comparing rates of chromosomal evolution between solanaceae and other plant and animal taxa
comparing the maps of tomato, potato, eggplant and pepper genomes provided an opportunity to estimate rates of chromosomal evolution in the solanaceae, resulting in an estimate of  <dig>  ~  <dig> inversions per million years and  <dig>  ~  <dig>  translocations per million years across different species, in other words,  <dig>  ~  <dig>  rearrangements per chromosome per million years. it was hard to make precise comparisons of this rate and those from other families due to differences in mapping techniques, map resolutions, criteria to identify rearrangements and methods of estimating divergence time. nonetheless, this rate in the solanaceae is comparable with that in the plant families poaceae, malvaceae and brassicaceae as well as many mammals  <cit> , although the rate is lower than that reported for some fast evolving taxa such as the genus arabidopsis  <cit> . given the largely constant chromosome number in the solanaceae and similar rates of chromosomal evolution across the solanaceous species studied in this work, we consider that the solanaceae has a modest rate of chromosomal evolution and the rate is likely shared by many solanaceous species.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative genome studies have been performed widely for solanaceous crops, mostly between pairs of species. recently, a large set of single-copy conserved orthologous  markers has provided an opportunity to combine data from multiple species and to describe the overall patterns of chromosomal evolution for the whole family. in the research described herein, we have taken advantage of cosii studies in tomato, potato, eggplant, pepper and diploid nicotiana species, to deduce the broad features and outcomes of chromosomal evolution in the solanaceae over the past  <dig> million years. the results reveal a modest and consistent rate  of chromosomal changes across the family, with a higher frequency of inversions than translocations. we have also identified hot spots of chromosomal breakages, supporting the notion that chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints are not randomly distributed. finally we have reconstructed the most likely genome configuration for the ancestors of these solanaceous species. this study thus provides the first broad overview of chromosomal evolution in the family solanaceae, and one of the most detailed thus far for plant families.
