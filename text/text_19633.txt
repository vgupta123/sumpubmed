BACKGROUND
maternally inherited cytoplasmic male sterility  has been described in over  <dig> plant species  <cit> . in most cases, the failure of pollen development in a cms background is suggested to be associated with chimeric open reading frames  that have arisen from unusual recombination events in mitochondria  <cit> . the cms-honglian  line of rice  was developed by the repeated backcrossing of a red-awned wild rice  from hainan island of china with an early-maturing indica variety called lian-tang-zao. the line is distinct both genetically and cytologically from cms-boro  rice and cms-wild abortive  rice  <cit> . hybrid rice varieties based on cms-hl have been widely grown in china since the beginning of this century because it performs better agronomically and produces better quality grain than those varieties based on other cms systems. in cms-hl rice, a chimeric mitochondrial gene called orfh <dig>  located downstream of atp <dig>  has been proposed as the candidate gene causing the cms trait of honglian rice  <cit> . however, no direct evidence shows that the chimeric orfh <dig> is responsible for the cms in honglian rice.

the mitochondrial genome carries important genetic information for a number of eukaryotic functions, including energy metabolism, development, programmed cell death and responses to oxidative stress  <cit> . in plants, the mitochondrial metabolism is usually disturbed by high levels of reactive oxygen species , generated in response to a range of biotic and abiotic stressors  <cit> . ros have already emerged as an important regulator of plant development, and increasing evidence indicates that they also play a role in cell growth, since their spatial distribution affects the morphological development of plants  <cit> . we have previously shown that an excessive level of ros was found during microsporogenesis in cms-hl rice. furthermore, the depletion of atp and nadh and the degradation of mitochondrial genomic dna were observed in cms-hl rice  <cit> . however, the initial trigger of the oxidative stress response remains to be determined.

in this paper, we investigated the localization of the orfh <dig> gene product and found that the protein is mainly present in the mitochondria of cms-hl rice. thus, the orfh <dig> gene was fused to a mitochondrial targeting sequence and used to transformed a honglian maintainer line. the result showed that import of this protein into mitochondria induced cytoplasmic male sterility and reduced root growth. in addition, the expression of the transgene was also associated with excessive accumulation of ros, a declined cellular atp/adp ratio, a reduced mitochondria membrane potential and a lower oxygen consumption rate. interestingly, similar phenotypes were also observed in the yta line. these results indicate that orfh <dig> impairs mitochondrial function, which appears to disturb the development of both male gametophytes and the roots of cms-hl rice.

RESULTS
the orfh <dig> product is present in the mitochondria of the yta line
western blot profiles of total proteins extracted from the anthers of yta, as well as mitochondrial proteins isolated from the etiolated seedlings and spikelets were distinguished by the presence of an ~ <dig> kd protein. this product was detectable among the total anther protein sample and the mitochondrial protein samples from the etiolated seedling and spikelet, but not among the total protein samples form either the etiolated seedling and spikelet , or in any samples extracted from ytb . to rule out the possibility that the signal in the yta samples was non-specific, western blot were performed using only the secondary antibody . in these negative controls, the ~ <dig> kd band not appear . meanwhile, electron microscope immunocytological analysis also showed orfh <dig> protein were mainly localized in mitochondrial of yta but not in ytb .thus, orfh <dig> appears to strongly enriched in the mitochondria of yta, and at a particularly high level in the anther. the orfh <dig> gene sequence predicts a protein with a molecular mass of  <dig> kd, instead of the  <dig> kd band that we observed. this discrepancy may have been due to anomalous gel migration. the submitochondrial distribution of orfh <dig> was also investigated. as shown in fig. 1b, orfh <dig> protein appeared to be mainly associated with the insoluble protein fractions . taken together, these results indicated that orfh <dig> protein is mainly present in the mitochondria of yta both in anthers as well as in vegetative tissues, and attached to the mitochondrial membranes.

expression patterns of orfh <dig> in anther and root tip of yta line
to analyze the expression pattern of orfh <dig> in the anther and root tip, immunofluorescence detection was used. in sections of the premeiotic anthers of yta, orfh <dig> was concentrated in the sporogenous cells, and was present at a gradually declining level in the secondary parietal cells, endotheciumnd and epidermis. in control sections of ytb anther, only the background signal was detected . in the sections of root tip, a strong signal was detected in the meristematic zone of the yta line, while a weak signal was observed in other regions of the yta root tip. in contrast, only a low background signal was observed in ytb line . these results indicate that the distribution of orfh <dig> protein is not uniform in anther and roots in the yta line.

a chimeric orfh <dig> transgene induces cms
to provide a direct genetic evidence that orfh <dig> can cause the male sterility of cms-hl, a cheimeric orfh79/mitochondria transit peptide was used for a transgenic experiment. expression cassettes pcon containing a constitutive promoter , a mitochondrial transit peptide sequence and orfh <dig> was transferred into shijinb , a japonica maintainer line of cms-hl rice . nineteen independent events were obtained and  <dig> transgenic events were confirmed by pcr firstly . furthermore, the  <dig> transgenic events appeared to display the typical phenotype of gametophytic male sterility, showing an approximately 1: <dig> ratio of fertile  vs. sterile  pollen grains . the seed-sets ranged from 50% to 70% in those t <dig> transgenic plants, indicating that the pistil was unaffected . to further confirm that orfh <dig> causes the gametophytic male sterility of honglian rice, three independent t <dig> transformants  were randomly chosen in order to analyze the segregation of the transgene in the t <dig> progeny. the segregation of the transgene among the t <dig> progeny  fit a 1: <dig> ratio, and the pollen of t <dig> progeny carrying orfh <dig> also showed a semi-male-sterile phenotype  similar to that of t <dig> progeny . if the presence of orfh <dig> was not correlated with pollen sterility, the transgene segregation in t <dig> progeny would be 3: <dig> rather than the 1: <dig> ratio that we observed. thus, these results indicate that the expression of orfh <dig> induced the abortion of pollen and that the transgene was transmitted through the female germ.

the presence of transgene was determined using pcr. positive plants: t <dig> progeny with orfh <dig> insert, showing a semi-male-sterile phenotype ; negative plants: t <dig> progeny without orfh <dig> insert, and showing a fertile phenotype.

molecular evidence of the expression of orfh <dig> in the transgenic plants
to provide further molecular evidence that orfh <dig> can cause the male sterility phenotype in the transgenic lines, expression of the transgene at the protein level was assayed by western blot. the mitochondria-enriched protein fraction was extracted from the callus that had been derived from the transgenic lines  and probed with anti-orfh <dig> antibody. an  <dig> kd band similar to that observed in yta was detected in the transgenic callus, but not in the shijing b callus . this confirmed that the transit peptide fused to orfh <dig> was properly processed and that orfh <dig> was imported into mitochondria in these transgenic lines. the results provided direct molecular evidence demonstrating that the presence of orfh <dig> in mitochondria corresponds to the male sterile phenotype of cms-hl rice.

mitochondria activity assay in yta line and transgenic plants expressing orfh79
since orfh <dig> is present mainly in mitochondria of yta, and importing orfh <dig> into mitochondria can induce the cms trait, which inspired us to focus on the mitochondrial activity. thus, we measured atp and adp content, the mitochondrial membrane potential and the respiration rate both in the yta line and transgenic plants. it was found the atp content in the male-fertile line  was higher than that in the male-sterile line  , and meanwhile, the atp/adp ratio in ytb line was about 2-fold higher than that in yta line . the mean of mitochondrial membrane potential in yta line was found to be  <dig> % lower than that of ytb , and the oxygen consumption rate in yta roots was decreased by  <dig> % compared with that in ytb roots . three independent transgenic plants  that had been determined to be male sterile and confirmed to contain orfh <dig> protein were chosen to do the parallel assay. the result showed that the mitochondrial membrane potential of the transgenic plants was reduced by  <dig> - <dig> % , while the atp+adp contents was reduced by  <dig> - <dig> %  and the average of atp/adp ratio was decreased by  <dig> % in contrast to the wild type . in addition, the respiration rates in transgenic plant roots were found to be significantly decreased by  <dig> - <dig> % compared with the wild type.

based on our previous investigation, excessive ros content was found during microsporogenesis in cms-hl rice  <cit> . to detect whether the transgenic plants also present excessive ros levels during microsporogenesis, we measured the ros content in the microspore of the transgenic plants using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluores-cein diacetate , a dye that is sensitive to ros. strong fluorescent intensity was observed in microspores of the transgenic plants, whereas much weaker fluorescence intensity was detected in wild type .

taken together, these physiological features in the transgenic lines mimic those in the yta line, this provided another evidence that orfh <dig> is responsible for the cms trait of yta. furthermore, these data showed that the mitochondrial activity both in yta line and transgenic plants are down-regulated, suggesting that accumulation of orfh <dig> in mitochondria impairs their normal function.

the transgenic expression of orfh <dig> retards root growth
in this study, we found that root growth of the transgenic plants were slower than that of the wild type. thus, root growth and development of the t <dig> transgenic progeny seedlings  was investigated in more detail. the length of primary roots of the independent transgenic seedlings was on average  <dig>  cm shorter than that of wild type seedlings growing at the same stage. furthermore, in the transgenic plants, the appearance of lateral roots was delayed by about two days . the total number of lateral roots in transgenic seedlings was less than that of the wild type at both five and seven days after germination. however, the number of lateral roots per centimetre was almost equal to that of the wild type. thus, it is likely that the initiation of lateral roots growth in transgenic plants was not defective. these findings demonstrate that constitutive expression of orfh <dig> retards root growth in transgenic plants.

excessive ros levels in the roots of both transgenic plants and the yta line contribute to retardation of root growth
previous research has shown that ros plays an important role in plant root development  <cit>  and we have found excessive ros in the microspore of the orfh <dig> transgenic plants. thus, we analyzed the production of ros in the root tips of transgenic plants using the oxidant-sensitive h2dcfda. the intensity of h2dcfda fluorescence in the transgenic plant root tip was observed to be higher than that in the wild type . furthermore, the appearance of root hair was observed to be delayed in transgenic plants compared with wild-type plants .

similarly, we analyzed the level of ros in root tips of yta and ytb. higher fluorescence intensity was detected in the root tip of yta than in ytb . furthermore, the primary root and lateral root growth were observed to be slower in yta compared with ytb .

to address the question as to whether the root growth inhibition observed in yta was brought about by a higher level of oxidative stress, the effect of adding the ros scavenger vitamin c to the culture solution was explored. interestingly, the inhibition of yta root growth was observed to be rescued when  <dig> nm vitamin c was supplemented in the solution . taken together, these results imply that root growth retardation in the yta line is associated with the excessive ros content.

discussion
orfh <dig> is responsible for the gametophytic male sterility of cms-hl
cms is a widespread phenomenon in plants, and is often associated with abnormal mitochondrial orfs. although orfh <dig> was proposed as a candidate gene corresponding to the male sterility of cms-hl rice, direct evidence for this was lacking. our experiments showed that the transgenic expression of orfh <dig> induces the abortion of about 50% of the pollens, indicating only the pollens carrying expressed orfh <dig> were disrupted, and pollen abortion occurs after meiosis. this is a typical feature of gametophytic male sterility in plants and this feature is associated with the segregation of the transgene in the t <dig> progeny. furthermore, the physiological features of the transgenic lines expressing orfh <dig>  including reduced atp/adp ratio, high ros content, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and lower respiration rate mimic all features of the hl-cms line . therefore, we believe that orfh <dig> is responsible for the gametophytic male sterility of cms-hl rice.

in cms boro rice, orf <dig>  which is probably allelic to orfh <dig>  has been identified as the gene responsible for male sterility  <cit> . orfh <dig> and orf <dig> share 98% identity with one another at the nucleotide level. only  <dig> nt differ, but each of these differences results in a distinctly different codon. however, both the appearance of the aborted pollen and the timing of pollen abortion differ markedly between these two cms types. in cms-bt rice, pollen abortion occurs at the tri-nucleate stage and is stainable with 1% i2-ki solution, revealing spherical, black pollen grains. while in cms-hl rice, pollen aborts at the di-nucleate stage and is not stainable with 1% i2-ki solution, revealing spherical, blank pollen grains . the mechanisms by such similar genes can cause such divergent phenotypes remain to be determined.

similarly to the cms associated proteins such as urf <dig> in cms-t maize  <cit>  and orf <dig> in cms wild beet  <cit> , orfh <dig> was observed to accumulate mainly in the mitochondria in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. at the same time, the accumulation of high levels of ros, a significantly decreased adenylate content as well as atp/adp ratio, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and a lower oxygen consumption rate were found both in the yta line and in the transgenic plant in which orfh <dig> was imported into mitochondria. thus, the results provided here demonstrated that accumulation of orfh <dig> in mitochondria impairs the mitochondrial function. in fact, dysfunctional mitochondria distribute throughout the plant but only the pollen function is lost, suggesting that the mitochondrial activity is strictly required for gametophyte development during microsporogenesis. this idea is in agreement with the hypothesis that the abnormal mitochondria in the cms line cannot meet the increasing demand for energy during microsporogenesis  <cit> . however, how the aberrant orfh <dig> protein affects mitochondrial function remains a subject for further investigation.

retarded root growth is associated with excessive ros caused by expression of orfh79
in previous studies, significant attentions have been focused on reproductive development in the study of cms. detailed studies on vegetative development have not been performed, especially on roots growing underground. however, in the cms lines of brassica napus and nicotiana tabacum, all tissues except for green leaves showed lower atp levels than their respective maintainer lines. this reduced energy availability had limiting effects on plant growth  <cit> . nevertheless, reduced plant height and retarded vegetative growth were also reported in other cms systems such as b. juncea  <cit> , n. tabacum cybrids  <cit> , and t. aestivum  <cit> .although some differences in alloplasmic lines have been observed, retarded root growth and reports of chimeric orf expression associated with the retardation of vegetative growth in cms plants have not been described until now. in our transgenic experiments, transgenic plants with orfh <dig> under the control of a constitutive promoter  showed retarded root growth similar to the yta line. however, the root development of the transgenic plants with orfh <dig> under the control of a pollen specific promoter was indistinguishable from that of the wild type, despite the fact that the transgenic plants also revealed an aborted pollen phenotype . therefore the products of such a cms-associated orf may disturb not only to the gametophyte development but also root growth.

ros play important physiological roles in plants, especially in signalling cell division and expansion, root growth and root hair development  <cit> . however, excessive levels of ros produce oxidative stress and inhibit plant root growth, as shown in the case for the inhibition of arabidopsis thaliana root tip elongation, which was inhibited by exogenously applied hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . in the pea root, high levels of exogenous aluminum ions trigger excessive amounts of ros production, leading to respiration inhibition, atp depletion and the inhibition of root elongation  <cit> . a similar effect has also been reported in rice roots: lead toxicity stunted rice root growth via abnormal ros production  <cit> . in our studies, an excessive amount of ros production was found both in the roots of yta line and in transgenic plants. moreover, the slow elongation of the primary root and lateral roots of yta can be rescued by a known scavenge of excessive ros, vitamin c. taken together, these results suggested that the excessive ros content caused by the expression of orfh <dig> is responsible for the retarded root growth.

as revealed by immunofluorescence, orfh <dig> preferentially accumulates in the sporogenous cells and root tip meristematic zone in the yta line. lee and warmke have previously reported that a 40- and 20-fold increases in mitochondrial number respectively in maize tapetal and sporogenous cells during microsporogenesis  <cit> . furthermore, we also observed that the density of mitochondria is higher in the root tip meristematic zone than that in other regions of the root . thus, the distribution pattern of orfh <dig> in anther and root is in accordance with the density distribution of mitochondria in these tissues. from this observation, we infer that the large number of mitochondria accumulated in the meristematic zone of these young tissues may amplify the consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction caused by orfh <dig>  this may be a critical reason responsible for the inhibition of development of these tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we found orfh <dig> accumulated mainly in mitochondrial and imported the protein into mitochondria induced male sterile and retarding root growth. in addition, the expression of the transgene was also associated with declined cellular atp levels, reduced mitochondria membrane potential, and excessive accumulated ros content. furthermore, similar phenotypes were also observed in yta line. these results indicate that orfh <dig> impair the mitochondria function, which may disturb the development of both male gametophyte and root of cms-hl rice.
