BACKGROUND
glaucoma affects the vision of approximately  <dig> million people  <cit> . optic nerve head excavation and degeneration of retinal ganglion cells are unifying characteristics of glaucoma. the causes of glaucoma are diverse and complex  <cit> . many risk factors are known for glaucoma  <cit> , with elevated intraocular pressure  being prominent  <cit> . iop can be pharmacologically lowered, which in some cases can inhibit the development and progression of glaucoma  <cit> . however, in a significant number of cases, decreasing iop does not prevent glaucoma progression. identifying and targeting the mechanisms of rgc degeneration could help to protect the vision of more patients. unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms of glaucoma are not well understood, and currently no therapies that target the neurodegeneration are commonly employed in clinical practice.

nitric oxide has different roles in the central nervous system. nitric oxide synthase  <dig>  can be induced in response to a variety of external signals. in some settings, nos <dig> activity plays an important role in inducing neurodegeneration  <cit> . nitric oxide production, particularly through nos <dig>  has been implicated in ischemia-induced death in the retina  <cit> . the ability of a nos <dig> inhibitor to protect rgcs from ischemia led to the suggestion that nos <dig> inhibition may be protective in glaucoma  <cit> . the possibility that nos <dig> inhibition could be neuroprotective in glaucoma was strengthened by a report showing that nos <dig> inhibition delays rgc degeneration after axotomy  <cit> .

several lines of evidence point to a possible role for nos <dig> in mediating glaucomatous neurodegeneration. in glaucoma patients, nos <dig> expression was found to be up-regulated in optic nerve head glia  <cit> . the optic nerve head is believed to be an important site of damage in glaucoma  <cit> . in addition, human optic nerve head astrocytes can be induced to express nos <dig> by either cytokines  <cit>  or increased hydrostatic pressure  <cit> . nos <dig> is induced in astrocytes of the optic nerve head in eyes of rats that have had intraocular pressure artificially increased by cauterization of the extraocular veins  <cit> . in the same rat model of glaucoma, pharmacological inhibition of nos <dig> by aminoguanidine or l-n-lysine 5-tetrazole amide reduced the number of rgcs that died  <cit> .

the general importance of nos <dig> in glaucoma was recently questioned by studies that do not support a role for nos <dig> in another model of glaucoma  <cit> . thus, the general importance of nos <dig> induction for glaucoma is not certain. considering these conflicting results from different induced rat models of glaucoma, it is important to further test the potential involvement of nos <dig> in an inherited mouse model of glaucoma.

the dba/2j mouse develops an inherited glaucoma with iop elevation that is secondary to a pigment dispersing iris disease. dba/2j glaucoma is similar to human glaucomas in that it is age-related and the pressure elevation is natural and variable  <cit> . the dba/ <dig> mouse has become one of the most widely used glaucoma models. the pressure elevation often leads to massive rgc loss, with the majority of eyes losing greater than 90% of their rgcs  <cit> . reported differences in the timing and nature of neuron death in dba/ <dig> substrains point to a complex disease process that is affected by environmental as well as genetic differences between colonies of mice  <cit> . in our well characterized colony of dba/2j mice, rgcs are specifically vulnerable to the glaucoma  <cit> . the pattern of rgc death supports involvement of axon injury in the optic nerve of dba/2j mice  <cit>  as well as in a closely related strain, dba/2nnia  <cit> . in fact, detailed studies of the optic nerve support early injury of rgc axons as a key pathologic feature of dba/ <dig> glaucomas  <cit> , with experimental evidence for an insult damaging axons within the optic nerve head  <cit> . considering the complex disease etiology, the specific vulnerability of rgcs, the characteristic pattern of rgc death and the early axon damage in the optic nerve head, dba/2j glaucoma has important similarities to human glaucoma. for these reasons, we used dba/2j mice in the current study. we used both genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of nos2activity to test the involvement of nos <dig> in glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve and retina in this inherited glaucoma model.

RESULTS
nos <dig> expression during dba/2j glaucoma
in some  <cit>  but not all studies  <cit> , increased expression of nos <dig> is reported in glaucoma patients and rat models of glaucoma. to determine the temporal and spatial expression pattern of nos <dig> in dba/2j mice, we examined rna and protein levels in the optic nerve head at different stages of glaucoma. the optic nerve head extending from the vitreal surface to approximately the non-myelinated-myelin junction of the optic nerve was dissected and used for rna preparation. there was a modest increase of nos <dig> rna by quantitative real time pcr analysis in eyes with moderate axon damage, but nos <dig> levels appeared to be lower in eyes with early or severe damage . immunohistochemical analysis of sagittal sections did not detect nos <dig> protein in either the retina or optic nerve head in the majority of eyes at each stage of disease. as a positive control, kidney sections from mice treated with lipopolysaccahride  were immunoreacted with the nos <dig> antibody and nos <dig> positive cells were detected . rare cells that were nos <dig> positive were identified in the optic nerve head of two severely affected eyes . although these expression studies provided no clear association between nos <dig> and glaucoma, nos <dig> is a powerful modulator of cell functions that may be transiently expressed by single cells. therefore, we continued to test the role of nos <dig> in this glaucoma by both genetically and pharmacologically inhibiting its function.

nos <dig> deficiency does not alter the iop profile of dba/2j mice
to investigate the involvement of nos <dig>  a null allele of nos <dig>  was backcrossed into the dba/2j strain for greater than  <dig> generations. the genetic removal of nos <dig> ensures that there is no enzymatic activity throughout life. glaucoma in dba/2j mice is the result of elevated iop that is secondary to an iris disease. preventing or lessening the iris disease alleviates iop elevation and prevents the subsequent neurodegeneration  <cit> . therefore, it is necessary to determine whether nos <dig> genotype altered the iris disease or iop profile. slit lamp examination at various time points throughout the experiment showed that nos <dig> genotype had no affect on the age of onset, progression, or severity of the iris disease . importantly, nos <dig> genotype did not alter iop in either young or aged mice , and mice of all genotypes had a glaucomatous iop elevation at 10– <dig> months of age .

nos <dig> deficiency does not prevent glaucomatous neurodegeneration
some optic nerves from dba/2j mice begin to show signs of glaucomatous neurodegeneration at  <dig> months of age  <cit> . the incidence and severity of glaucoma then increases rapidly over the next months, but not all mice develop glaucomatous nerve damage. complete deficiency of nos <dig> did not prevent homozygous mutant mice from developing severe glaucoma , showing that nos <dig> is not required for glaucomatous axon degeneration in the optic nerve. additionally, nos <dig> deficiency did not lessen the amount of glaucomatous optic nerve degeneration in mice that were 10– <dig> months of age .

although nos <dig> deficiency did not affect axon degeneration, it is a formal possibility that it may affect apoptosis of the rgc somata. we have previously shown that bax deficiency  prevents somal apoptosis even when almost all rgc axons have degenerated in the optic nerve  <cit> . to assess if nos <dig> deficiency protects rgc somata, even though it has no affect on their axons, we counted rgc layer cells for eyes whose nerves demonstrated different degrees of axon damage. nos <dig> genotype had no affect on the number of rgc layer cells in mice with either 'no or early' or severe glaucomatous optic nerve damage . thus, nos <dig> deficiency does not differentially protect the rgc somata. overall, our genetic studies detected no beneficial affect of completely removing nos <dig> activity in glaucomatous dba/2j mice.

aminoguanidine treatment
the lack of detectable protective affect of genetically ablating nos <dig> contrasts with the report of neufeld and colleagues  <cit> , who found that the nos <dig> inhibitor aminoguanidine was neuroprotective in a rat model with induced iop elevation. the outcome of these genetic and pharmacological studies may differ for a variety of reasons, including the possibility that the chemical inhibitor is not completely specific and has unknown off-target effects that may affect outcome. to better understand our findings in light of these reports, and to assess whether aminoguanidine has off-target effects that protect against glaucoma by a mechanism that is independent of nos <dig>  we tested the ability of aminoguanidine treatment to alleviate the glaucoma of dba/2j mice.

starting at either  <dig> or  <dig> months of age , aminoguanidine  was administered in drinking water . water consumption was measured for  <dig> ag-treated and  <dig> non-treated mice, to determine the dose of ag the mice received and whether ag in the drinking water affected water consumption. aminoguanidine did not affect the amount of water mice consumed  nor did it affect their body weight even after being on the drug for  <dig> months . this level of water consumption resulted in a calculated dose of  <dig> mg/kg/day. this dose is similar to that achieved by neufeld and colleagues in their aged rats .

aminoguanidine treatment does not alter iop
ag-treatment did not change the time course or the severity of the iris disease . we first checked for any affect of ag-treatment on iop using young pre-glaucomatous dba/2j mice. the iop of young mice was not altered by ag-treatment from  <dig> to  <dig>  months of age. similarly long-term ag-treatment had no affect on iop when assessed at  <dig> to  <dig> months, key ages of elevation in both sexes  <cit> . the iops of treated mice were significantly elevated compared to young mice . importantly, ag-treatment did not alter the average iop or the population distribution . the lack of effect of ag-treatment on iop is consistent with previous studies  <cit> .

aminoguanidine treatment is not effective at preventing glaucomatous neurodegeneration
when treatment was started at  <dig> months of age using mice housed at the jackson laboratory, ag-treatment did not alter the distribution of nerve damage at either  <dig> or  <dig>  months . in fact, many mice developed severe glaucoma despite ag-treatment. this lack of protection was confirmed with a second experiment using large cohorts of mice. these mice were housed and treated at alcon laboratories. the ag treatment was the same except that it commenced at  <dig> months of age. for these mice, glaucomatous optic nerve damage was assessed at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> months of age . at no time point did ag protect from degeneration, and at  <dig> months it tended to exacerbate the disease . interestingly, the damage was more severe in the second experiment. this fits with the variability of disease between different reports from different institutions and suggests that environmental factors alter disease progression in dba/2j mice  <cit> . overall, our combination of genetic and pharmacologic experiments provides no evidence for a role of nos <dig> in this model of glaucoma.

discussion
deciphering the mechanisms responsible for rgc dysfunction and demise in glaucoma is expected to lead to new neuroprotective treatments that will help to preserve the vision of more patients. nos <dig> can be induced in nervous system microglia and astrocytes during disease, and nos can act as an important mediator of neural cell damage and death  <cit> . nos <dig> was reported to be induced in optic nerve glia during glaucoma, and involved in glaucomatous damage to the retina in a rat model of glaucoma  <cit> . here we tested the involvement of nos <dig> in glaucomatous neurodegeneration using the inherited dba/2j model of glaucoma. there were modest changes in optic nerve head nos <dig> rna expression during the various stages of disease progression. occasionally, nos <dig> protein was detected in optic nerve cells with advanced glaucoma but not in unaffected optic nerves. however, neither the complete genetic ablation nor the treatment with an inhibitor of nos <dig> had any affect on the severity or incidence of this glaucoma. although our studies have not assessed if other nitric oxide synthases could have compensated for the absence of nos <dig>  as has been suggested in other systems  <cit> , our results do not support a damaging role of nos <dig> in this mouse model of glaucoma. we clearly demonstrate that glaucoma can manifest even when nos <dig> is completely absent.

in contrast to our results, neufeld and colleagues have proposed an important role for nos <dig> in glaucoma and suggested its inhibition as a treatment  <cit> . these studies have provided a variety of data supporting a role for nos <dig> in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. they have shown that nos <dig> is expressed in the optic nerve in human glaucoma patients  <cit>  and in a rat model of ocular hypertension  <cit> . nos <dig> expression can be induced by increased hydrostatic pressure in cultured human astrocytes derived from human optic nerve heads  <cit> . most intriguingly, using a rat model where iop is artificially elevated by cauterization of extraocular veins, neufeld and colleagues have shown that pharmacological inhibition of nos <dig> could lessen glaucomatous rgc death  <cit> .

recently, pang and colleagues  <cit>  did not find evidence for a role of nos <dig> in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. they induced elevated iop in rats by injection of hypertonic saline into episcleral veins  <cit> . no significant increase in nos <dig> expression  was found in optic nerve head cells due to ocular hypertension. furthermore, they found no evidence for increased nos <dig> in transected rat optic nerve heads or in optic nerve heads from glaucoma patients. aminoguanidine treatment had no affect on glaucomatous damage in the rats. also using episcleral injection of hypertonic saline in rats to induce elevated iop, kasmala and colleagues  <cit>  found that another inhibitor of nos <dig>  l-n-lysine 5-tetrazole  did not protect rgcs from death induced by elevated intraocular pressure.

there are multiple possible explanations for the differences in the observed role of nos <dig> in glaucoma in these studies, including differences in genetically determined risk factors between the animals that were used. pang and colleagues discuss many of the possibilities  <cit> . here we limit discussion to a known difference between the studies of neufeld and colleagues  and other studies . neufeld and colleagues cauterize extraocular veins to induce high iop. this approach is more traumatic to vessels and surrounding tissue than the injection of hypertonic saline into extraocular veins . the dba/2j model is natural and does not involve experimentally-induced trauma to vessels. the greater vascular trauma in the cauterization model may somehow affect experimental outcome. it has been suggested that the extraocular vein cauterization method may induce retinal ischemia  <cit> . if true, ischemia could contribute significantly more to rgc death in the cauterization model than in the other models. nos <dig> is clearly involved in ischemic retinopathy and nos <dig> inhibitors  can protect rgcs from ischemic injury in rats  <cit> . it will be important to assess ischemic markers in the various models to help determine if ischemia is more severe in the cauterization model and if this explains the differential efficacy of nos <dig> inhibition.

given the complexity of glaucoma, multiple different mechanisms are likely to contribute to disease in individual patients  <cit> . the relative importance of specific pathogenic mechanisms is likely to differ between individual patients and individual eyes due to differences in magnitude or duration of iop elevation, environment, lifestyle or genetic constitution. moreover, it is possible that different rgcs degenerate by different mechanisms even within an individual eye, depending on differences in protective or damaging factors in the local microenvironment. mild or transient ischemia may contribute to rgc death in some patients . thus, although we found no protective effect of nos <dig> in the inherited dba/2j model of glaucoma, it will be important to study the role of nos <dig> in settings that have a greater ischemic component. both iop and blood pressure determine ocular perfusion pressure, and decreased ocular perfusion pressure may contribute to glaucomatous damage  <cit> . thus, individuals with low blood pressure may be at greater risk of glaucomatous damage and their glaucoma may have a relatively strong ischemic component. using dba/2j mice, our future studies will assess these possibilities, including the potential protective role of nos <dig> in a low blood pressure setting.

genetic studies of human glaucoma have identified glaucoma genes and potential alleles that confer increased risk of disease. these genetic studies will help to define key pathologic mechanisms. one study reported a correlation between a regulatory region of the nos <dig> gene and the development of primary open angle glaucoma  <cit> . however, in another study where the nos <dig> gene was specifically assessed  <cit> , nos <dig> was not found to be associated with glaucoma. studies of large patient populations are needed to exploit the full benefit of genetic studies for glaucoma. continued studies utilizing a variety of animal models and human samples are clearly required to resolve the complex molecular pathways that determine rgc survival and death in glaucoma.

CONCLUSIONS
nos <dig> activity is not required for rgc death and associated axon degeneration in dba/2j mice. further studies are required to assess the general importance of nos <dig> in glaucoma.
