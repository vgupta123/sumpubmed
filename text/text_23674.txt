BACKGROUND
rapidly-evolving rna viruses that establish chronic infections, such as the human immunodeficiency virus  and the hepatitis c virus , appear to exhibit qualitatively different evolutionary dynamics when their genetic diversity is studied at different organisational scales  <cit> . within-host evolutionary dynamics can be observed by comparing sequences that represent different virions sampled from a single infected individual over several years, whereas among-host evolution is revealed by collating sequences that each represent a different infected host. the most significant distinction between these two levels is that the evolution of among-host sequences is shaped by numerous genetic bottlenecks arising from transmission events, whereas that of within-host sequences is not.

the hepatitis c virus   infects more than  <dig> million people worldwide and is a leading global cause of liver disease and liver cancer  <cit> . understanding the evolution of hcv has considerable medical relevance. for example, viral diversity is known to play a key role in determining both the outcome of long-term chronic infection and the likelihood of success of anti-viral drug therapy  <cit> . however, despite the wealth of hcv sequence data and the relevance of hcv genetic diversity to public health, many aspects of hcv molecular evolution are poorly understood, particularly in comparison to hiv, despite hcv having a higher overall global prevalence that hiv. one of the most fundamental aspects of hcv evolution is its genomic rate of molecular evolution. previous estimates of hcv evolutionary rates have employed a number of different estimation methods, genome regions and scales of analysis, hindering direct comparisons, and few have systematically considered the variation in evolutionary rate along the whole hcv genome and its causes  <cit> . the hcv genome encodes a single polyprotein ~ <dig> amino acids in length, comprising three structural  and seven non-structural genes   <cit> . the e <dig> envelope glycoprotein contains 'hyper-variable regions'  that are targeted by the human humoral immune response  <cit> . an additional limitation of previous studies is that they have typically assumed that evolutionary rates are constant among lineages and through time . although statistical tests of this hypothesis for hcv are not always significant , such failures to reject the strict clock are most likely a reflection of small sample sizes, because larger hcv data sets indicate significant among-lineage rate variability  <cit> . furthermore, previous studies have typically evaluated hcv rates using a single estimated phylogeny, thus ignoring an important source of statistical error . many previous studies used non-phylogenetic methods  to estimate the hcv evolutionary rate, which are now known to be less efficient and potentially more biased than phylogenetic approaches  <cit> .

previous analyses of hcv molecular evolution also have been restricted to a single evolutionary scale. it has been demonstrated that the evolutionary dynamics of hiv differ substantially among levels of organisation  <cit> . for example, hiv- <dig> within-host evolutionary rates are higher  <cit>  and more variable  <cit>  than those among-hosts. although the biological causes of these differences are as yet unknown, possible explanations include preferential transmission of slowly-evolving lineages, a decreasing within-host evolutionary rate through time, or viral reversion to variants of higher fitness upon transmission to a new host  <cit> . crucially, it is not known whether these scale-dependent differences are peculiar to hiv- <dig> or whether other chronic viral infections, such those caused by hcv, exhibit similar behaviour. detailed investigation of multi-level evolution in viral populations - for which much data are available - may help to build a more general understanding of this complex evolutionary phenomenon.

here, for the first time, we quantify and compare the within- and among-host molecular evolution of whole hcv genomes. we avoid the methodological limitations outlined above by analysing whole genome sequences and employing a 'relaxed molecular clock' approach that explicitly models and estimates the level of rate variation among lineages  <cit> . this approach is implemented in a bayesian inference framework  <cit>  that incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty into estimates of evolutionary parameters. in addition to employing powerful methods of analysis, we study the entire hcv genome using a partition approach, thereby revealing how scale-dependent evolution affects different viral genome regions in different ways.

methods
datasets
we compiled three datasets, one representing only evolution within infected hosts, the other two representing evolution at the 'epidemiological' or among-host level. to maximise compatibility and statistical power, we sought data sets comprising sequences from the same subtype sampled over at least  <dig> years, and which contain complete or near-complete viral genomes.

our within-host data set is based on hcv subtype 1b genomes obtained from  <dig> women who were all infected by a contaminated blood product  that had been generated from a single hcv-infected blood donation . this data set comprises full-length genomic hcv sequences from  <dig> patients, sampled at two time-points, plus an additional sequence sampled in  <dig> from the hcv-infected blood donation  as well as from switzerland  and germany . to aid computational efficiency, the subtype 1a and 1b datasets were reduced in size, resulting in two final alignments comprising  <dig> subtype 1a and  <dig> subtype 1b sequences. retained sequences were chosen such that the original temporal range of the initial dataset  was maintained, by randomly excluding sequences from over-represented years. both among-host data sets represent hcv evolution across several decades of epidemic transmission, hence each branch in their phylogenies will represent a number of transmission events.

model selection procedure
to select the best-fitting evolutionary model for bayesian mcmc inference, we performed an initial series of model selection analyses using beast v <dig> . <dig>  mcmc output was inspected for convergence by visual inspection of the chain and by calculation of effective sample size statistics, as implemented in tracer v <dig>  http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk. where necessary, mcmc operators were optimised by trial and error to improve chain mixing. various different substitution, coalescent and molecular clock models were compared by calculating bayes factors , which is the difference in log marginal likelihoods between two model combinations  <cit> . we calculated approximate marginal likelihoods for each model via importance sampling using the harmonic mean of the sampled likelihoods . evidence against the null model  is indicated by 2ln > <dig>  and > <dig> .

in all datasets, nucleotide sites were assigned to two partitions:  1st & 2nd codon positions and  3rd codon positions. our preliminary analyses indicated that a good fit to the data was obtained by ascribing a separate hky nucleotide substitution model and a separate gamma among-site rate heterogeneity model to each of the two codon partitions . this substitution model was sufficiently computationally-efficient to permit mcmc convergence  and was therefore used throughout the remainder of the study. for the within-host data set, phylogenetic priors were used to represent known epidemiological information about the transmission chain: specifically, all sequences from the infected patients  were constrained to be a monophyletic group, and a prior normal distribution was imposed on the date of the common ancestor of this group .

both strict and relaxed molecular clock models were tested for each of the three datasets using the bayes factor test as described above. the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model  was used, which provides an estimate of the 'coefficient of variation' statistic, representing the scaled variance in evolutionary rate among lineages . this statistic is usefully interpreted as indicating the degree to which molecular evolution is 'clock-like'. a posterior distribution for the coefficient of variation that does not include zero indicates that the relaxed clock model provides a better fit to the data than the strict clock. having chosen the optimal molecular clock model for each data set, we tested three different coalescent models:  constant population size,  exponential growth, and  the flexible bayesian skyline plot  model. the optimal coalescent model was also chosen using bayes factors. note that in this study, the coalescent model is being used as a prior distribution for phylogenies, whose parameters are marginalised and ignored, and not as an explicit model of the population under study.

genomic partition model
after the selection of the most appropriate molecular clock and coalescent models, each data set was split into  <dig> non-overlapping partitions  <dig> nt in length, beginning at the start codon of the core gene. in order to estimate separate molecular clock parameters for each partition whilst simultaneously minimising estimation variance, we implemented a genomic partition model in beast v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . this model estimated separate molecular clock parameters and nucleotide frequencies for each partition, whilst all partitions share the same underlying nucleotide substitution model , coalescent model parameters, and phylogenetic tree, thus making the most statistically efficient use of the available sequence information. xml files for performing these analyses are available on request. partitions were kept of equal length  so that intra-genic variation could be measured and so that estimation uncertainty could be directly compared among genome regions. we deliberately ignored the alternate open reading frame in the core gene, as its molecular evolution is under no selective constraints . this orf therefore has no effect on the evolution of the hcv main reading frame

partition specific dn/ds analyses
it was computationally-impractical to calculate dn/ds ratios for each partition whilst simultaneously incorporating phylogenetic uncertainty, hence we began by estimating a maximum likelihood  tree for each of the three datasets using phyml, under a hky model of nucleotide substitution with gamma distributed site variation. the ratio of replacement-to-silent nucleotide substitution  and the transition/transversion ratio were calculated separately for each of the  <dig> non-overlapping partitions defined above using paml  <cit> , given the ml tree and nucleotide alignment for each dataset.

RESULTS

a constant = constant population size, expo = exponential growth, bsp = bayesian skyline plot

b a single average rate of evolution estimated across the whole genome 

for all three data sets, the estimated genomic rate of evolution was consistent among all of the coalescent models investigated under the relaxed clock assumption . for the among-host subtype 1a data set, the mean genome-wide rate was estimated to be  <dig>  -  <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitutions/site/year , while the equivalent rates for the subtype 1b data set were slightly lower . the within-host genome-wide evolutionary rate was lower still than the two among-host datasets . for all analyses, the lower confidence limit of the coefficient of variation statistic  was above zero, indicating statistically-significant variability in evolutionary rate among lineages. as expected for a continuous protein-coding region, the relative evolutionary rate of 1st and 2nd codon positions was significantly lower than that of the 3rd codon position .

genomic partition model
in light of the model selection results, the relaxed molecular clock was used in the genomic partition analysis. since neither the bsp nor the exponential coalescent model was statistically favoured, we chose the model that exhibited the best mcmc mixing behaviour . for each genomic partition, we estimated the following parameters:  mean substitution rate,  relaxed clock coefficient of variation,  the relative rate of codon positions 1+ <dig> to that of codon position  <dig>  the estimated values for each of these parameters are shown in figure  <dig>  with both the point estimate  and the 95% highest posterior density  confidence limits  shown for each parameter in each partition.

for each partition, we also estimated the coefficient of variation  statistic . in general, the mean and variance of this parameter was significantly higher for the within-host dataset, hence among-branch rate variation is much higher in this data set than in the among-host data sets. in several partitions, the lower hpd confidence limit was close to zero, indicating that the strict clock hypothesis could not be excluded in these instances. mean cov values for among-host data sets were typically around  <dig> - <dig> , in line with previous estimates for hiv  <cit>  with the exception of the core gene, which exhibited values > <dig> . for the within-host dataset, cov estimates were also elevated for the last two genomic partitions .

we also estimated the ratio of the evolutionary rate at codon positions  <dig> &  <dig> to that at codon position  <dig> . this ratio can be computed concurrently with other molecular clock parameters and can be used to investigate selective pressures acting on gene sequences, because almost all changes at codon positions  <dig> &  <dig> are non-synonymous and the majority of changes at codon position  <dig> are synonymous. estimates of the crr for each genomic partition are shown in figure 1c. in general, the crr was low between partitions  <dig> and  <dig>  corresponding to most of the non-structural genome region, indicating on average strong selective constraint. partitions  <dig> and  <dig>  however, have raised crr values for the among-host data sets. crr values are slightly higher in the e <dig>  e <dig> and ns <dig> genes, with a particularly high ratio observed for the within-host data set in partition  <dig> 

to determine whether the elevated evolutionary rate and correspondingly high crr of partition  <dig> in the within-host data set was independent of the 3rd codon position rate, we plotted the absolute rates for the 1st+2nd versus 3rd codon positions for each partition . as expected, the 1st+2nd position rate was much lower than the 3rd position rate for all partitions in the among-host datasets. for partition  <dig> of intra-host dataset, the 1st+2nd position rate  was greater than the 3rd position rate . however, in this partition the 3rd position rates for the intra-host datasets were also significantly elevated. the lowest 3rd position rates were observed in partitions  <dig> and  <dig>  this is consistent with the presence of rna secondary structure  in these regions of the hcv coding region  <cit> . this structure will likely impose selective constraints on 3rd codon positions, resulting in a lower evolutionary rate at silent sites. however, we observed no consistent effect of rna secondary structure on crr values: in partition  <dig> the crr is raised, which could reflect a lower rate of silent change, whereas the crr in partition  <dig> is very low. when evolutionary rates vary among silent sites, dn/ds ratios are commonly interpreted as measures of the difference in selection pressure between replacement and silent sites  <cit>  and we propose that the crr ratio should be interpreted similarly.

visual inspection of figure  <dig> suggests that genomic partitions with high evolutionary rates also have a high crr. to test for correlations among the three molecular clock parameters , figure  <dig> shows scatterplots among all estimated parameter values. there is a clear positive correlation between mean rate and crr  which is robust to the exclusion of the outlying data point . in contrast, there is no clear correlation between mean rate and cov , nor between crr and cov . figures 2b and 2c do, however, clearly illustrate the higher cov values for the within-host data set.

lastly, to investigate the relationship between crr and the more widely-used dn/ds ratio, we estimated dn/ds values for each partition and data set using paml  <cit>  . figure  <dig> shows the scatterplot of dn/ds versus crr values, which, as expected, are strongly correlated . the estimated regression relationship between these two variables is dn/ds =  <dig> . crr .

discussion
since its discovery in  <dig>  the molecular evolution of hcv has been investigated using a wide variety of approaches. early studies approximated hcv evolutionary rates by simply counting the number of observed changes between sequences sampled at different times from infected patients  <cit>  or from a chimpanzee  <cit> . subsequent studies used nucleotide substitution models to estimate genetic distances, but commonly focused only on sub-genomic regions, particularly the core, e1/e <dig> and ns5b genes . rates of evolution have been estimated using  relative-rate methods ,  linear regressions of genetic distances against sampling times ,  maximum likelihood phylogenetic methods  and  bayesian phylogenetic methods . some analyses were performed on among-host data, some on within-host sequences, and others on a combination of both. unsurprisingly, estimates of the tempo of hcv evolution from these various studies have been highly variable and are impossible to compare directly due to the different methodologies and genome regions employed.

our study of hcv molecular evolution has employed powerful statistical methods  <cit>  in a consistent manner, enabling us to make reliable inferences about how hcv sequence evolution varies among genome regions, and how it varies between different levels of organisation. as expected, the variation we observed in evolutionary rate across the genome closely matches genomic variation in overall hcv genetic diversity . while most of the hcv genome evolves at ~ <dig>  substitutions/site/year, a rate very typical of rna viruses  <cit> , the e1/e <dig> region  exhibited the highest evolutionary rates, consistent with previous reports . this region contains several known antibody epitopes and hyper-variable regions, and our high crr and dn/ds values in these regions confirm the action of positive selection  <cit> .

a striking result from this study was the elevated evolutionary rate in the intra-host dataset for partition  <dig> when compared to the among-host dataset. several explanations are possible. first, we might hypothesise that saturation of nucleotide changes  is occurring at the among-host level but not at the within-host level. although this phenomenon is certainly important for rapidly-evolving viruses when evolution measured over several decades is extrapolated to thousands of years , it is very unlikely to be responsible for our result, since our within-host and among-host timescales differ only by a factor of  <dig>  additionally, we found no evidence of saturation at the 3rd codon position in partitions  <dig> and  <dig> for the within-host dataset . a second explanation follows from the primary difference between the within- and among-host datasets: the latter contains transmission events while the former does not. upon transmission to a new host, specific mutations that conferred a fitness advantage in the immune environment of the donor may be lost or quickly revert to wild-type in the new environment of the recipient. this phenomenon has been reported for both hcv  <cit>  and hiv  <cit>  and is consistent with the observation of an elevated rate in the epitope-rich region  of the hcv genome when transmission bottlenecks are absent . reversion is also consistent with the elevated crr in this region, which indicates a higher net rate of adaptation within hosts. a third and intriguing possibility is that slowly-evolving lineages within a host are preferentially-transmitted, resulting in a lower long-term evolutionary rate  <cit> . this is consistent with the high among-branch rate variation  observed within-hosts here, and for hiv- <dig> elsewhere  <cit> , suggesting that there is significant variation in the rate of evolution of different lineages within an infected host. however, preferential transmission of slower-evolving lineages should result in a lower among-host long-term replication rate  equally across all partitions - which is not observed in our data .

we did observe a consistently higher genome-wide among-host evolutionary rate for subtype 1a in comparison with subtype 1b. this difference could be a consequence of the major modes of transmission of that characterise each subtype: subtype 1a is more commonly associated with intravenous drug use and subtype 1b with past blood transfusions. if within-host hcv evolution is faster at the start of chronic infection  then the long-term among-host rate of evolution will depend to some extent on the rate of transmission  <cit> . a similar phenomenon, albeit more extreme, has been previously reported for htlv-ii, for which differences in the rate of transmission among different risk groups greatly affect the long-term evolutionary rate  <cit> . our data cannot indicate whether average evolutionary rates vary during the course of a single chronic infection, and this question remains an important area for future research.

a higher rate evolution for subtype 1a was especially pronounced for partitions  <dig> and  <dig>  which contain functionally important genome regions within the ns5a gene. interestingly, this elevated rate resulted from an increase in 1+2nd substitutions, suggesting the presence of selected sites for this subtype. ns5a forms a necessary part of the replication complex but its function is not fully understood  <cit> . it is involved in cellular pathways including the interferon response  <cit>  and genetic variation within ns5a has been associated with response to anti-viral drug therapy. specifically, partition  <dig> contains the interferon sensitivity-determining region , variation within which is reported to predict response to interferon drug therapy  <cit> , although inconsistently between subtypes 1a and 1b  <cit>  and with different results observed in japanese and european cohorts  <cit> . the pkr binding domain  and the "v3" region, are also included in partition  <dig>  changes within which may be related to treatment outcome  <cit> . similarly, partition  <dig> contains the less well-studied interferon/ribavirin-resistance determining region   <cit> , in which excess mutations in patients infected with subtype 1b were more likely to respond to therapy  <cit> . the possible difference in selective pressure between 1a and 1b that we observed in this region is consistent with subtype-specific differences in resistance mutations in ns5a against the potent viral inhibitor bms- <dig>  <cit> . information on drug treatment was unavailable for the subjects included in this study, and although differences in treatments are unlikely to account for the observed differences in this region, the possibility cannot be excluded.

CONCLUSIONS
because our study employed powerful statistical methods on whole genome sequences, we have been able to quantify the variation in hcv evolutionary dynamics at different scales of organisation for the first time, and thereby confirm that scale-dependent differences in rate are not restricted to hiv and may represent a common feature of chronic rna viral infection. we posit that the most likely explanation of our current data is that host-specific reversion events are responsible for an elevated rate of evolution and adaptation in the e1/e <dig> region within-hosts compared to among-hosts.
