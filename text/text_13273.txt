BACKGROUND
the insulinoma associated protein tyrosine phosphatase  <dig>  is a 106 kda  transmembrane glycoprotein  whose encoding gene is localized in human chromosome 2q <dig>  ia- <dig> is expressed in neuroendocrine cells, such as the peptidergic neurons of the central nervous system, the chromaffin cells present in the adrenal medulla and the endocrine pancreas  . ia- <dig> belongs to the protein tyrosine phosphatase  family, particularly to the receptor type ptps; however, it lacks such enzymatic activity  <cit> . in pancreatic islets, ia- <dig> participates in the cytoplasmic transport of dense core secretory granules  containing insulin, its subsequent excretion into the extracellular space, biogenesis, storage and recycling, as well as in beta-cell proliferation . the ia- <dig> structure consists of three domains: the extracellular domain  that is separated from the intracellular domain or ia-2ic  by a single transmembrane domain . it was demonstrated that, after exocytosis, calpain mediates the release of ia-2ic from the plasma membrane; a process after which ia- <dig> travels to the nucleus where its inactive ptp domain binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine present in the stat <dig> protein, thus upregulating gene expression of dsg proteins, including insulin and ia- <dig> .

diabetes mellitus  is a group of metabolic diseases of heterogeneous etiology characterized by poor metabolic control of patients and the presence of marked hyperglycemia, which stems from defects in insulin secretion and/or action  <cit> . according to the american diabetes association, dm can be classified into four main groups: type  <dig>  type  <dig>  gestational and other types. type  <dig> dm  is characterized by the destruction of pancreatic beta-cells leading to a deficiency in insulin secretion that results in elevated blood glucose levels . the loss of tolerance to pancreatic islet antigens is known to be mediated by a t cell-dependent autoimmune process. ia- <dig> is one of the immunodominant autoantigens involved in the autoimmune attack on the beta-cell in dm. the other autoantigens implicated are: insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase  and zinc transporter  <dig> . the autoantibodies specific to insulin, gad, ia- <dig> and znt <dig>  can be detected in patient sera as the first detectable sign of emerging beta-cell autoimmunity . these autoantibodies are currently used as additional serological markers to confirm the autoimmune process underlying insulin deficiency in diabetic patients. these markers are useful for predicting t1dm in children and to achieve the correct diagnosis in adult patients with intermediate forms of dm, like latent autoimmune diabetes of the adults  .

ia-2a mostly recognize the ia-2ic , since this domain is the one exposed upon cell damage. ia-2a bind to discontinuous epitopes, therefore, the correct folding of ia-2ic is critical for immune recognition . moreover, the diagnostic sensitivity in both newly diagnosed type  <dig> diabetic patients and pre-diabetic individuals is highest when ia-2ic is used as antigen for ia-2a recognition, thus suggesting that this domain should be used as detection antigen in t1dm–related autoantibody screening studies  <cit> . approximately, 60– <dig> % of patients with t1dm are positive for ia-2a  <cit> . the probability of t1dm patients’ first-degree relatives contracting dm within 5 years from the detection of the positive marker is 65–85 % for ia-2a , since these autoantibodies are known to appear later during the development of the autoimmune process. therefore, the detection of ia-2a can be considered indicative of rapid disease progression  <cit> .

the assessment of a complete set of autoantibodies is not only applied to confirm the existence of an underlying autoimmune process in infant-juvenile or adult diabetic patients , and to monitor first-degree relatives of diabetic individuals , but also to predict the need for insulin treatment. besides, the presence of autoantibodies can be used as inclusion criteria for enrolment in prediction and prevention trials and as an endpoint in observational studies . the usefulness of ia-2a detection lies in its high diagnostic specificity, since the frequency of such a marker in healthy individuals is only 2–4 %  <cit> . the reference method for detection of ia-2a is the radioligand binding assay   <cit> , which includes a recombinant radiolabelled autoantigen as tracer for immunocomplex formation in a fluid phase. this tracer is usually synthesized in cell-free eukaryotic systems, bearing -marked aminoacids, making it environmentally inappropriate, expensive and limited to authorized laboratories. the development of more accurate, sensitive and inexpensive methods to detect ia-2a can be helpful to achieve an early diagnosis or prediction of dm. for these reasons, a handy source of properly folded recombinant antigen is needed for the development of innovative and cost-effective non-radiometric immunoassays for the quasi-quantitative assessment of ia-2a  that are applicable to low or medium complexity laboratories  <cit> .

the most widespread recombinant expression system is the prokaryotic one employing escherichia coli. this system has proved to be easy to handle, it is inexpensive and the protein expression yield is high  <cit> . different fusion partners are often used to facilitate solubilisation and/or purification of eukaryotic proteins in this system, such as the glutathione-s-transferase, the mannose binding protein or thioredoxin  . we have previously described the expression of ia- <dig> in e. coli; however, the recombinant protein obtained was not stable enough to be implemented in the routine diagnosis of autoimmune dm  <cit> . in this work we have developed a complete and original process for the production and recovery of the properly folded intracellular domain of ia- <dig> fused to trx  in a prokaryotic expression system with high performance. we have also carried out the biochemical and immunochemical characterization of trxia-2ic and design variants of non-radiometric immunoassays for the efficient detection of ia-2a using the stable recombinant antigen produced.

mass spectrometry analysis
in order to assess total protein mw, affinity purified trxia-2icwas subjected to mass spectrometry  analysis. briefly, a 1 μl aliquot of the sample was spotted onto an anchorchip . one μl of an oversaturated solution of sinapinic acid in 30/70/ <dig>  % v/v acetonitrile/water/tfa was added to the sample and left to crystallize by air-drying. samples were analyzed on a bruker microflex maldi-tof device . in order to further characterize and identify the protein, trxia-2ic was subjected to proteolytic digestion and ms analysis. concisely, the sample was dissolved in 50 mm nh4hco <dig> buffer, ph 8; a volume equivalent to 20 μg was subjected to disulfide bond reduction, with 20 mm dithiothreitol for 45 min at 56 °c, and alkylation with 20 mm iodoacetamide for 45 min at rt in the dark. the sample was then diluted to a final concentration of 1 m urea. finally, trypsin and chymotrypsin proteolytic digestion were performed separately and samples were analyzed by nanohplc  coupled to a mass spectrometer with orbitrap technology , enabling both separation and identification of peptides. ionization of samples was made by electrospray  and data analysis was performed by the proteome discoverer software version  <dig> , thermo scientific. coverage percentages were calculated based on the number of identified peptides/total number of peptides.

immunochemical characterization of trxia-2ic

dose-response curves with  <dig> ia-2a rba positive type  <dig> diabetic patient sera were performed by ria, adding trxia-2ic at variable concentrations and using ia- <dig> synthesized in an eukaryotic system . all dose-response curves  showed similar ic <dig> , indicating comparable trxia-2ic immunoreactivity with sera. the immunochemical ability of trxia-2ic to compete with ia- <dig> was assessed qualitatively by incubating  <dig> type  <dig> diabetic patients sera in the presence of  <dig> nm trxia-2ic . all tested sera were ia-2a positive with sds of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , median  <dig> , range  <dig>  to  <dig>  and cut-off value for positivity sds =  <dig> . a significant difference between sera from type  <dig> diabetic patients and healthy control individuals was observed . all type  <dig> diabetic patient sera became virtually negative under antigen excess : median sds changed from  <dig>  to - <dig>   with cold trxia-2ic excess .fig.  <dig> immunochemical characterization and storage study. a: dose-response curves for  <dig> ia-2a rba positive type  <dig> diabetic patient sera incubated with different concentrations of trxia-2ic. each curve includes best-fit values from the log  vs. response - variable slope  equation: correlation coefficient data , ic <dig> values and an approximation to the affinity constant of ia-2a  calculated as the inverse of ic <dig>  b: inhibition capacity of trxia-2ic assessed in  <dig> ia-2a positive type  <dig> diabetic patient sera in the absence  or presence  of trxia-2ic. twenty healthy control sera were used in order to set a cut-off value. c: dose-response curves for a pool of  <dig> ia-2a rba positive type  <dig> diabetic patient sera for different concentrations of trxia-2ic  and trxia-2ic-biotin . d: inhibition capacity of trxia-2ic-biotin assessed in  <dig> ia-2a positive type  <dig> diabetic patient sera in the absence  or presence  of trxia-2ic-biotin. twenty healthy control sera were used in order to set a cut-off value. binding is expressed as sds, and the dotted lines represent the cut-off value. e: ic <dig> vs. storage time for trxia-2ic stored at -20 °c in 100 mm 2me lysis buffer  and -20 °c in 50 % glycerol, 50 mm 2me lysis buffer . these assays were performed by standard ria protocols, as described in methods.





competitive quantitative and qualitative assays were also performed for trxia-2ic-biotin in order to evaluate any distortion in epitopes caused by biotynilation. the immunochemical identities between trxia-2ic and trxia-2ic-biotin were analyzed and expressed in terms of parallelism. as seen in fig. 5c, when using a pool of ia-2a+ human sera, parallelism and identity between curves was achieved . similar results were obtained for trxia-2ic biotinylated under conditions of high biotin concentrations . the inhibition assay for trxia-2ic-biotin was performed by incubating  <dig> type  <dig> diabetic patient sera in the presence of  <dig> nm trxia-2ic-biotin . all tested sera were ia-2a positive with an sds of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , median  <dig> , range  <dig>  to  <dig>  and a cut-off value for positivity sds =  <dig> . it can be observed that sera from type  <dig> diabetic patients differed significantly from healthy control samples . all patient sera became virtually negative  under antigen excess: mean sds changed from  <dig>  to  <dig>   with cold trxia-2ic-biotin excess .

storage and stability studies
displacement curves were performed over time  using a pool of  <dig> sera from ia-2a positive type  <dig> diabetic patients and the tracer ia- <dig> in competition with cold trxia-2ic under different storage conditions. inhibition dose response curves  were drawn for each condition and the ic <dig> value was determined and plotted against time . as it can be observed, the ic <dig> values remained relatively constant over time for the storage condition of -20 °c in 50 % v/v glycerol, 50 mm 2me lysis buffer, indicating that the immunoreactivity was maintained throughout the evaluation period. contrarily, the storage condition at -20 °c in 100 mm 2me lysis buffer caused a gradual increase in the ic <dig> value until t =  <dig> d, when the dose-response curve could no longer be properly fitted.

trxia-2ic application in immunoassays for ia-2a assessment
forty eight sera from children and adolescents with t1dm were tested in parallel by rba, bcelisa and cl-belisa for ia-2a detection. the specificity was calculated as 100 % minus the percentage of false positives, using control individuals . in order to establish normally distributed results for healthy control individuals, outlier removal was needed ; however, these outliers were included in all plots and also for specificity calculations, as they were considered false positives. when analyzed by rba,  <dig> sera were positive , while  <dig> were negative . a median sds of  <dig>  was obtained, ranging from - <dig>  to  <dig> ; cut-off value for positivity sds =  <dig>  . with this analysis, a specificity of  <dig>  % was obtained and healthy control individuals differed significantly from t1dm patients .fig.  <dig> immunoassays for ia-2a assessment in healthy control and type  <dig> diabetic patient sera. the results, expressed as sds, were obtained by rba , bcelisa  and cl-belisa . the cut-off value for each assay is indicated by a dotted line and medians for each population are indicated by a dashed line. d: venn’s diagrams for integrated ia-2a results for children and adolescents with newly diagnosed t1dm, obtained by rba, bcelisa, and cl-belisa

results were obtained from healthy control and newly diagnosed t1dm patient sera .

by bcelisa, a total of  <dig> sera out of the  <dig> t1dm patients analyzed were positive , with sds ranging from - <dig>  to  <dig> , and an sds =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , median  <dig>  and cut-off value for positivity sds =  <dig> . out of the  <dig> ia-2a positive sera by rba,  <dig> scored positive by bcelisa, whereas  <dig> patients were negative . these results indicated that bcelisa had an analytical sensitivity of  <dig>  % for this sera collection  and  <dig>  % specificity when analysis of healthy control sera was performed . it is noteworthy that the rba failed to render positive reactions in  <dig> patients that were indeed detected by the bcelisa. populations significantly differed for median antibody levels .

out of the  <dig> patient sera,  <dig> scored positive for ia-2a by cl-belisa , whereas  <dig> patients were negative  . twenty five ia-2a positive sera by rba scored positive when evaluated by cl-belisa, showing an analytical sensitivity of  <dig>  %, sds ranging from - <dig>  to  <dig>  and a median sds =  <dig>  . healthy control sera  resulted in  <dig>  % specificity and showed two different statistical populations that needed outliers removal by the rout test . remaining results were normally distributed. in order to achieve maximum analytical sensitivity for this protocol, sds >  <dig>  was chosen as the cut-off value. as seen for bcelisa, cl-belisa detected  <dig> positive sera that the rba could not, one of which was positive for bcelisa as well. populations significantly differed for median antibody levels .

the venn’s diagram  depicts the integrated results of rba, bcelisa, and cl-belisa. as shown on this figure,  <dig> out of  <dig> sera were positive by rba, bcelisa, and cl-belisa, while  <dig> were negative by all methods. five sera were only positive by both rba and bcelisa, while  <dig> were only positive by both rba and cl-belisa. moreover, bcelisa and cl-belisa were able to detect  <dig> patients that were found negative by rba . the latter sera were not considered false positives since these samples had been obtained from newly diagnosed patients with t1dm. cl-belisa was able to detect  <dig> ia-2a positive sera that bcelisa was not; whereas bcelisa detected  <dig> patients as ia-2a positive that cl-belisa did not. the spearman correlation coefficient  and p value  showed that the pairing was significantly effective and there was an acceptable concordance between both methods; however, no significant correlation between antibody levels by rba and either solid phase tests was found.

discussion
although radiometric methods have an excellent performance in the diagnosis of dm, the use of radioactive isotopes is falling out of use because of their multiple disadvantages . therefore, the development of alternative methods of acceptable performance, greater simplicity, lower cost and more applicability in low complexity laboratories are needed. the methods most widely used include solid phase immunoassays which require large amounts of antigen for their development and routine application. our laboratory has previously attempted to produce recombinant ia-2ic in order to implement elisa-like tests  <cit> ; however, due to the instability of the product  the rba for ia-2a remains the method of choice for routine analysis in argentina.

in this work, an alternative approach for ia-2ic expression was developed. the methodology presented herein involved the production of soluble cytoplasmic ia-2ic by means of the solubilising effect of trx  <cit> , which is a phenomenon already observed for other proteins . the use of the trx fusion partner increases the chance of correct folding, which is critical for binding of autoantibodies from patients with t1dm. the expression of trxia-2ic was accomplished in e. coli gi <dig> and gi <dig> strains . high production levels of the c-terminal fusions to thioredoxin were obtained through the use of ptrxfus vector carrying pl, which is a strong bacteriophage λ promoter. as advised, collection of samples at different timepoints during the course of the induction period was carried out in order to evaluate variations in protein solubility, stability and concentration  <cit> . the lysis of harvested bacteria was performed and the isf evaluation was carried out . even though a substantial expression of trxia-2ic was observed in both strains, gi <dig> showed a slightly higher protein expression under shorter induction periods than gi <dig>  the expression of soluble trxia-2ic became minimal under on incubations in the gi <dig> strain, which was expected for large induction times under higher temperatures. it can be speculated that under such conditions, trxia-2ic became unstable due to the excessive synthesis and improper folding, a phenomenon that led to insolubilisation and product accumulation in the form of inclusion bodies . this observation was corroborated by sds-page and wb of isolated ib . on the other hand, the expression in gi <dig> strain rendered good levels of protein, with a maximum at 16 h of induction, and minimal visualization of degradation by-products, probably due to low activity of proteases at 20 °c. although gi <dig> strain should not be completely ruled out as a valuable source of trxia-2ic, shorter induction times are preferred for scaling up procedures. taking into account these results, the expression in gi <dig> strain employing a 3 h induction time, was selected as optimal condition for trxia-2ic production in any low-medium complexity laboratory and was therefore used for further studies.

the purification of trxia-2ic from the isf was accomplished by a single step of affinity chromatography using an agarose-based matrix with arsenic residues. this chemical ligand binds selectively to vicinal dithiols, such as the ones present in the catalytic site of trx . the levels of soluble protein expression obtained in e.coli gi <dig> were higher than those previously reported in the literature for prokaryotic systems  <cit> . high purity levels were achieved, even higher than those reported in the results section , which does not include the contribution of trxia-2ic dimer. furthermore, these unique properties of the fusion partner allowed us to establish a general platform for expression and purification of soluble trx fusion proteins, such as trxgad and trxpi  <cit> , along with trxia-2ic, applicable to the laboratory diagnosis of autoimmune dm. the amount of protein obtained with this methodology was suitable for the development of solid phase ia-2a immunoassays; in fact, the result of a standard purification protocol may allow passive adsorption of more than  <dig> 96-well polystyrene microplates. taking into account these results, the affinity purified trxia-2ic from isf was further characterized.

the first quality control step was to verify if trxia-2ic had the theoretical expected mw. the analysis of the purified protein by sds-page, sec and ms rendered results that coincided, within the experimental error, with the theoretical mw values calculated from the sequence. furthermore, we observed that under native conditions, both a monomeric form and aggregates of a dimer-like conformation would coexist when solubilised. the sds-page analysis employing dithiothreitol demonstrated that these dimers were bound by covalent bonds, specifically disulfide bonds . according to literature  <cit> , the cysteine residues were unlikely to form disulfide bonds, contributing little to the three dimensional structure of the protein. probably, disulfide bridges are formed later due to the action of reactive oxygen species during storage or the ia-2ic ptp and juxtamembrane domains tendency to dimerize , leading to polymerization. this in vitro observation could be a resemblance of the in vivo regulation of many receptor-type ptps. furthermore, the oxidation of the core cysteine  to cysteic acid would block access of antibodies, which turns storage buffer a critical aspect in the stability of ia-2ic  <cit> . for this reason, we decided to maintain the 2me reducing conditions after purification. regarding the determination of the stokes radius of the protein, since trxia-2ic is a  <dig>  da protein, the hydrodynamic behavior was compatible with a properly folded monomer that deviates moderately from an ideal sphere   <cit> . upon performing ms analysis after proteolytic digestion, sequence coverage of  <dig>  % was achieved over the  <dig> residues constituting the trxia-2ic, which is a percentage suitable to accomplish the autoantigen identification. taking into account the biochemical characterization of the entire protein, we have expressed genuine human ia-2ic as a fusion protein with trx.

immunochemical studies of trxia-2ic allowed us to demonstrate that the protein is able to displace the binding of radiolabeled eukaryotic ia-2ic from ia-2a, thus confirming the integrity of conformational epitopes in the recombinant antigen, which is a critical requirement to ia-2a recognition. it is noteworthy that the approximate ka values obtained for  <dig> sera were in the order of 108 m- <dig>  which correlates with literature data   <cit> . since the calculated ka for ia-2a were, within the limits of experimental error, the same for trxia-2ic and these previously published data for ia-2ic from e. coli, it can be speculated that the epitopes as well as the overall protein conformation are not affected during prokaryotic expression and trx fusion. furthermore, with a larger number of ia-2a positive patient sera, we demonstrated that they were able to recognize recombinant trxia-2ic, displacing the radioactively labelled eukaryotic antigen. considering that most sera from type  <dig> diabetic patients only target conformational discontinuous epitopes of ia-2ic  <cit> , this result reinforces the hypothesis of a correct folding of epitopes in the ia-2ic portion, probably due to the presence of energetically or kinetically favourable conditions.

even though an ek site was included in the plasmid, a further enzymatic removal of the trx portion from the fusion protein to avoid cross reaction phenomena was not necessary since we have previously demonstrated that healthy control and diabetic sera do not react with bacterial trx  <cit> . therefore, we have decided to use the entire fusion protein for the development of immunoassays since trx did not interfere with ia-2a recognition, it helped in proper protein folding and stability, and even simplified purification. furthermore, the amino group of the n-terminal portion of trx could be useful to improve the orientation of ia-2ic on surfaces with free carboxyl residues by covalent bonds, such as those required in surface plasmon resonance cm <dig> sensor chips for thermodynamic and kinetic studies of autoantibodies, and in polystyrene microspheres for flow cytometry  <cit> .

in order to increase the possibilities for immunoassay development, trxia-2ic was biotinylated. when the immunochemical behavior of trxia-2ic-biotin was studied, the dose-response curves generated by ria showed identity between trxia-2ic and its biotinylated counterpart, according to the general principles of immunochemical cross reactivity  <cit> . furthermore, competitive qualitative assays showed that all patient sera became virtually negative under trxia-2ic-biotin excess. all these results indicate that the recognition by ia-2a of both trxia-2ic and the biotinylated protein was practically the same; therefore, it could be deduced that the biotinylation did not alter critical epitopes for interaction with ia-2a.

stability studies in the storage condition at -20 °c in 100 mm 2me lysis buffer indicated that as trxia-2ic storage time proceeds, the displacing concentration required for a response half between b/b0min and b/b0max  was increasing to the point of no longer being recognized by ia-2a. however, trxia-2ic immunoreactivity was maintained throughout the evaluation period when the fusion protein was kept at -20 °c in 50 % v/v glycerol, 50 mm 2me lysis buffer. for this reason, the latter storage condition was selected, which ensured immunochemical quality of the recombinant antigen for at least four months, being applicable to routine immunoassays for the detection of ia-2a. this finding is one of the most interesting properties of the protein under study, as previous attempts in our laboratory failed to obtain ia-2ic with sufficient stability to yield immunoassays for routine applications, as most of the soluble protein precipitated within 24 h.

since trxia-2ic could be expressed in a simple prokaryotic system with high yields, purity and stability, and it was properly identified and immunoreactive against ia-2a positive patient sera, we proceeded to apply this protein in non-radiometric methods for ia-2a detection. to start with, a population of  <dig> children and adolescents with newly diagnosed t1dm were subjected to ia-2a assessment by the reference method rba, which shows the best sensitivity and specificity parameters in international quality controls . as previously described  <cit> , it is currently accepted that rba alone is not enough to rule out the existence of autoimmunity in childhood diabetic patients; therefore, the performance of simultaneous determinations of all major markers  is recommended. in this work, we managed to develop two methods capable of detecting ia-2a in some sera that rba could not, probably due to differences in the principles of detection . it has also been demonstrated that fluid phase radiometric assays may underestimate the ia-2a titers due to the formation of insoluble immune complexes which do not bind to protein a-sepharose, a phenomenon that would not occur in solid phase immunoassays  <cit> .

the first alternative method, bcelisa, included the development of a solid phase immunoassay, based on a standard design for detection of antibodies, similar to an indirect elisa, characterized by the immobilization of the biotinylated antigen to the microplate via an avidin bridge  <cit> . this design emerged as a viable option for solving the possible denaturation of the protein when adsorbed onto the plastic surface of the microplate  <cit> , which would be deleterious for ia-2a binding mainly because they recognize discontinuous epitopes. unfortunately, the performance parameters showed a narrow dynamic range and high signals with healthy control sera, with the consequent low sensitivity  and relative sensitivity  unsuitable for routine application. another drawback of this assay is the requirement of a large sample volume, which makes it impractical when children and juvenile patients must be assessed. however, these performance values do not differ much from previous data corresponding to the same design for ia-2a  <cit>  or gada  <cit> . the poor performance could not be attributed to alterations in critical epitopes for recognition by ia-2a since it was shown that trxia-2ic-biotin exhibited immunoreactivity comparable to trxia-2ic. this phenomenon could be attributed to differences in the principles of antigen:antibody interaction  and detection .

in order to improve the performance in ia-2a assessment, we proceeded to the optimization of cl-belisa, the first described test for the determination of ia-2a with chemiluminescent detection. while this detection shows increased sensitivity, it can lead to higher non-specific signal as well. for this reason we decided to develop an immunoassay variant with high specificity. one way to reduce the background signal is to use the labelled specific antigen to detect bound antibody instead of the detection of total bound igg with labelled xenogeneic anti-immunoglobulin antibody, which decreases the signal-to-background ratio  <cit> . previous data obtained by our research group have shown that this design has acceptable performance values for the clinical application in routinely gada determination in conventional elisa or flow cytometry-based immunoassays  <cit> . the design is based on the immobilization of the antigen to the solid phase, the incubation with the specific autoantibody  and a fluid phase interaction with the biotinylated antigen via the available paratope. for detection of ia-2a, we demonstrated that it presented a wide dynamic range, even higher than that described for the reference method. the parameters of sensitivity , relative sensitivity  and specificity , although lower than those for rba, are more than acceptable for use as a first line screening method for assessing humoral markers. it is difficult to compare the performance of this assay with those of previous studies where ia-2a is detected because in those studies different antigens were used, as well as different patient populations and healthy control individuals  . the lower sensitivity showed by cl-belisa, in comparison with rba, could be a consequence of partial denaturation of trxia-2ic when adsorbed onto the surface of polystyrene microplates. concerning the epitopes recognized by ia-2a, it was previously found that these autoantibodies mostly recognize the c-terminal domain of ia- <dig>  <cit> . thus, it is not surprising that the trx moiety, which is an n-terminal extension of trx-ia-2ic, did not adversely affect the sensitivity of the elisas reported here. the lack of correlation between solid-phase and liquid-phase assays has been previously reported and discussed . in this sense, different thermodynamic principles apply to elisa and rba, since in the latter antigen–antibody reaction occurs in the liquid phase, in high dilution and near the equilibrium; meanwhile in both elisa protocols the interaction occurs in solid phase, where the amount of immunocomplexes is highly dependent on antibodies concentration. in fact, in t1dm, autoantibodies concentration is really low , turning their detection into an analytical challenge using solid phase assays, especially for sensitivity limitations. then, as expected, there was a low correlation between the results obtained by both elisa protocols and rba. this protocol also used a lower volume of sera than bcelisa, but still higher than that used in rba . concerning healthy control individuals, the presence of possible false positive may be due to a matrix effect caused by samples from patients who did not have the proper fasting as diabetic patients did. as mentioned above, the presence of anti-trx crossreactivity in healthy control sera could be ruled out  <cit> . when a comparison was made with bcelisa, cl-belisa had higher values for the above mentioned analytical parameters. in addition, the differences in dynamic range between methods can be explained, at least partially, by higher sensitivity with chemiluminiscent detection and increased signal-to-background ratio in immunoassay design. as regards differential detection of immunoglobulin isotypes, while cl-belisa can potentially detect any, other immunoassays have limitations for binding specificity to the antibody conjugated to peroxidase  or protein a . in order to better characterize the performance of cl-belisa, we increased the number of type  <dig> diabetic patients  and healthy controls  samples already tested . as a result, a sensitivity of  <dig>  %, an analytical sensitivity of  <dig>  % and a specificity of  <dig>  % were obtained. it is noteworthy that in the dasp and the iasp the number of samples that are received to evaluate the analytical performance of different immunoassays is similar to the number used in this work. employing a higher number of samples, the sensitivity values remained fairly the same; however a slightly increased in the specificity of the assay was observed since the percentage of detected outliers decreased in a more representative population. this data reinforces the applicability of cl-belisa in ia-2a routine determination.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings of this study can be summarized in the following statements: i) the recombinant vector ptrxia-2ic was designed, synthesized and quality-controlled, ii) soluble human ia-2ic was expressed as a properly folded thioredoxin fusion protein in e. coli, iii) higher levels of trxia-2ic expression were obtained after 3 h of induction on gi <dig> strain, iv) highly pure trxia-2ic was recovered from the intracellular soluble fraction after a single step purification by affinity chromatography, v) the mw of trxia-2ic could be estimated by sds-page, sec and ms, vi) the presence of trxia-2ic soluble monomers and covalent-mediated dimers was determined under native conditions, vii) trxia-2ic was properly identified by wb and ms, viii) excellent immunochemical behavior of properly folded full trxia-2ic was validated by inhibition or displacement of ia- <dig> binding from ia-2a, ix) great stability over time was found under proper storage conditions and x) low cost and environmentally harmless non-radiometric methods for ia-2a assessment were developed, which are accessible to many laboratories.

furthermore, methods for ia-2a detection by flow cytometry based on the use of polystyrene microspheres, with the potential simultaneous determination of the main humoral markers of autoimmune dm are currently being developed in our laboratory  <cit> , since multiplex testing will facilitate high-throughput screening of t1dm in the general population  <cit> . it is clear that better tests based on pure antigen preparations will allow better screening of dm risk, characterizing the course of the disease and the distinction between dm of immune origin and that of metabolic cause.
