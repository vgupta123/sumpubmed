BACKGROUND
a sugar transport system which is widespread among various microorganisms is the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system   <cit> . the pts is characterized by the uptake of the carbon source, which is simultaneously phosphorylated resulting in intracellular sugar-phosphate. the transfer of the phosphate group to its substrate consists of five distinct reactions. the first step is the autophosphorylation of enzymei, where phosphoenolpyruvate acts as the phosphate donor. secondly, enzymei transfers the phosphate group to the his- <dig> residue of the hpr protein. enzymei and hpr together are designated the general or central part of the pts. hpr, in turn, transfers the phosphate group to the substrate-specific enzymesii. in general, enzymeii consists of two hydrophilic domains  and one transmembrane domain . subsequently, the phosphate group is transferred within the enzymeii complex from domain iia to domain iib. the iic-domain transports the substrate into the cell and the phosphate group is finally transfered from iib to the substrate and the phosphorylated sugar is released into the cytoplasm  <cit> .

the fast growing, gram-positive bacterium corynebacterium glutamicum is widely used for the fermentative production of amino acids  <cit>  and the pts system is the major uptake system responsible for the transport of fructose, glucose, and sucrose in this organism  <cit> . in c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> five genes were identified, which encode proteins with known functions in the pts . in detail, ptsi encodes the enzymei and ptsh the enzyme hpr of the general part of the pts  <cit> . furthermore, ptsg encodes the sugar-specific enzymeii involved in the uptake of glucose, ptss is involved in sucrose uptake, and finally ptsf is responsible for the uptake of fructose  <cit> . however, physiological results were already obtained for the function of all pts genes with known function in c. glutamicum  <cit> . additionally, for the general part of the pts, the activities of enzymei and hpr were demonstrated in a cell-free assay. pts-dependent transport and the physiological function of the ptsg gene in the uptake of glucose were also investigated  <cit> . genetically engineered mutations in the putative glucose- and sucrose-specific enzymesii encoded by ptsg and ptss, revealed impaired growth on glucose and sucrose, respectively, indicating glucose transport by ptsg and sucrose transport by ptss  <cit> . inactivation of the ptsf gene resulted in a significantly reduced growth on fructose as a sole carbon source, therewith indicating the function of ptsf in fructose uptake  <cit> . furthermore, ptsf-defective mutants showed a diminished growth rate compared to the wild type with sucrose as a sole carbon source, and additionally an accumulation of external fructose during exponential growth  <cit> . due to the lack of a fructokinase activity in c. glutamicum the internally liberated fructose, resulting from the cleavage of sucrose-6-phosphate taken up by ptss, cannot be metabolized and is exported  <cit> . therefore, ptsf activity is also necessary to import the external fructose in order to completely metabolize sucrose. furthermore, moon et al.  <cit>  identified one enzymeii encoded by cg <dig> and cg <dig> with unknown substrate specifity.

the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in pts transport are well studied in a variety of gram-negative and low-g+c gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . however, little is known about gene regulation of pts in corynebacteria. an hpr-kinase/phosphatase activity as well as the essentially conserved serine-residue  <dig> in the hpr amino acid sequence, which exerts carbon catabolite control in low-g+c gram-positive bacteria, was not detected in c. glutamicum  <cit> . additionally, genes encoding transcriptional antiterminators of the bglg-family like glct of b. subtilis  or bglg of e. coli  are only represented by a pseudogene in the genome of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>   <cit> . however, it has to be noted that other c. glutamicum isolates apparently have functional copies of antiterminator-like genes as well as additional genes for enzymes ii  <cit> . as another transcriptional regulatory system, in the low g+c gram-positive bacterium streptococcus gordonii the deor-type regulator frur was characterized, which controls fructose-pts gene expression in dependence of fructose, sucrose or xylitol  <cit> . the expression of the pts genes ptsf, ptsg, and ptss in c. glutamicum was initially considered to be constitutive  <cit> , but recently, ptsg transcription was observed to be induced by switching from biomass to l-lysine production  <cit> . however, a global carbon regulation in corynebacterium glutamicum could not be observed until now, but candidate genes associated with the pts were recently reviewed  <cit> .

the aim of this study was the characterization of the transcriptional regulation of pts genes in c. glutamicum. by first analysing gene transcription in the fructose-pts gene cluster and transcriptional regulation of all known pts genes, we found a pts-sugar specific transcriptional regulation of all pts genes. by deletion mutagenesis of cg <dig>  and expression analysis by real-time-rt-pcr and microarray hybridization, sugr was identified as a pleiotropic transcriptional regulator of all pts genes. electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified sugr protein were employed to determine the sugr binding sites and its effector metabolites.

during the preparation of this manuscript, engels and wendisch  <cit>  reported the identification of the deor-type transcriptional regulator encoded by the gene sugr in c. glutamicum, acting as a transcriptional repressor of the ptsg gene. by comparing a sugr mutant with its parent strain by microarray hybridization, these authors found that the ptsf and ptss genes are under the control of this regulator, which they termed sugr. the transcriptional role of sugr was extended in this work to the fructose-pts cluster genes ptsi, cg <dig>  fruk, and ptsh and completes the understanding for the expression of all described pts genes in c. glutamicum in general and the expression of the genes of the fructose-pts cluster in detail. furthermore, the effector studies in this work points to a sugar specific regulation of these genes similar to the trmb regulator of thermococcus litoralis and pyrococcus furiosus  <cit> .

RESULTS
the extended fructose-pts gene cluster of c. glutamicum contains four transcriptional units
in the genome of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  <cit> , the locations of the five pts genes ptsi, ptsh,ptsf, ptsg, and ptss were identified. on this account, the pts genes can be grouped into the fructose-pts gene cluster  and the distantly located glucose- and sucrose-pts genes ptsg and ptss, respectively, as well as the hitherto uncharacterized genes cg <dig> and cg <dig> . the genes ptsi, cg <dig>  fruk, ptsf, and ptsh of the fructose-pts cluster together with the region encoding sugr and cg <dig> form the extended fructose-pts gene cluster .

in order to analyse the transcriptional organization of the extended fructose-pts gene cluster, mrna transcripts overlapping adjacent coding regions were investigated by real-time rt-pcr. in these experiments, mrnas spanning the intergenic regions between sugr and cg <dig>  cg <dig> and fruk, fruk and ptsf, and between ptsf and ptsh, respectively, were detected in the c. glutamicum strain res <dig> grown on glucose . however, a non-coding region of  <dig> bp between the coding regions of ptsf and ptsh was observed indicating a possible promoter upstream of ptsh. considering these observations and the localization of ptsi on the opposite strand, it is most likely, that the genes sugr-cg <dig> and cg2118-fruk-ptsf form two operons, whereas ptsi is monocistronic. although a read-through transcription from ptsf to ptsh was detected, the ptsh gene is probably also transcribed monocistronically. the operon predictions by the computer program vimss  <cit>  and the predicted positions of transcriptional terminators 3' of cg <dig>  ptsi and ptsh determined by the computer program transterm  <cit> , depicted as stem-loop structures in fig. 1a, support this view.

consistent with these interpretations, four transcriptional start sites were localized upstream from the genes sugr, ptsi, cg <dig>  and ptsh, using the rapid amplification of cdna ends  method . the deduced promoter sequences showed similarities to the sequences of the - <dig>  and - <dig>  regions of the c. glutamicum consensus promoter  <cit> . the promoter of the cg2118-fruk-ptsf operon showed the highest similarity to the consensus promoter, whereas the promoters of sugr-cg <dig>  ptsi, and ptsh were less conserved, especially in the - <dig> region, . furthermore, it was found that the divergent promoters pptsi and pcg2118produce mrnas overlapping by a complementary sequence of  <dig> nucleotides.

transcription of the fructose-pts gene cluster is enhanced in c. glutamicum cultures grown on glucose or fructose when compared to cultures grown on acetate
in order to investigate a carbon source-dependent expression of the genes belonging to the extended fructose-pts gene cluster, the transcription levels were investigated by rt-pcr experiments. for this purpose, total mrna was isolated from c. glutamicum res <dig>  grown in minimal media containing acetate, glucose or fructose as a sole carbon source. glucose and fructose were employed as pts sugars requiring the expression of the pts gene cluster for their uptake, whereas acetate represents a non-pts carbon source. the relative mrna amounts of the genes belonging to the extended fructose-pts cluster  were determined using real-time rt-pcr. the values from the glucose- and fructose-grown cultures were compared to those obtained from cultures grown on acetate . the mrna levels of sugr and cg <dig> showed only minor changes during growth on glucose and fructose in comparison to acetate. in contrast to this, all genes of the fructose-pts gene cluster from cg <dig>  to cg <dig>  showed significantly higher mrna levels during growth on glucose and fructose. the levels of the genes ptsi and ptsh did not differ between cells grown on glucose and fructose. this is in accordance with the need for expression in the presence of both sugars. in contrast to this, mrna isolated from fructose grown cultures showed significantly higher transcription of cg <dig>  fruk, and ptsf. the different expression patterns of cg <dig>  fruk, and ptsf in cultures grown on glucose or fructose as sole carbon sources correlated with the requirement of the cell for a higher expression of the fructose-specific enzymeii  and the 1-phosphofructokinase encoded by fruk with fructose as the sole carbon source. these results are a clear indication for a carbon source-dependent transcriptional regulation of the genes of the pts cluster.

the sugr gene is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the fructose-pts cluster containing ptsi, cg <dig>  fruk, ptsf, and ptsh of c. glutamicum
due to the classification of sugr and cg <dig> as deor-type regulators, they are both interesting candidate genes for investigating their involvement in the carbon source-dependent transcriptional regulation of the fructose-pts cluster genes. single deletion mutants of sugr and cg <dig> were constructed by gene replacement in c. glutamicum res <dig> in order to elucidate the possible roles in this regulation . these deletions removed  <dig> of  <dig> nucleotides from the sugr coding region and  <dig> of  <dig> nucleotides from the cg <dig> coding region, rendering the respective gene non-functional and resulting in strains lg <dig>  and lg <dig> , respectively.

the possible involvement of sugr or cg <dig> in transcriptional regulation of ptsi, the cg2118-fruk-ptsf operon, and ptsh was determined by real-time rt-pcr. for these experiments, total mrnas isolated from res <dig> and the mutant strains lg <dig> and lg <dig> were used. the cells were grown in shaking flasks in liquid minimal media with 2% acetate as sole carbon source. acetate as the sole carbon source was chosen, because an increased transcription of the fructose-pts cluster genes could be observed when res <dig> was grown on glucose and fructose instead on acetate. therefore, growth on acetate may cause the transcriptional repression of the fructose-pts cluster genes. to find out whether the sugr or the cg <dig> gene product is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the fructose-pts cluster genes, the expression in the two deletion mutants lg <dig> and lg <dig> was compared to the expression in the res <dig> strain when all strains were grown on acetate. the analysis revealed a strongly increased transcription of the fructose-pts cluster genes ptsi, cg <dig>  fruk, ptsf, and ptsh in the sugr mutant lg <dig> . in contrast to this, the transcription of the fructose-pts cluster genes in the cg <dig> mutant lg <dig> was only weakly influenced. it is therefore concluded, that the sugr gene product downregulates transcription of the fructose-pts gene cluster during growth on acetate, whereas cg <dig> and its gene product does not seem to be involved in the transcription of the fructose-pts cluster genes under the applied experimental conditions.

the sugr gene of c. glutamicum is involved in the repression of pts gene transcription
comparative microarray hybridization experiments with total mrna isolated from the cg <dig> deletion mutant lg <dig> and the parental strain res <dig> both grown on acetate were conducted in order to explore the complete sugr regulon. in the microarray experiments using the c. glutamicum whole-genome dna microarray described previously  <cit> , two biological replicates were hybridized, simultaneously applying label-swapping. the results of the microarray experiments comparing the sugr mutant and the res <dig> strain revealed  <dig> genes with increased and five genes with decreased transcript levels in the sugr mutant. all genes of the fructose-pts gene cluster were found in the group of genes with induced transcript levels . interestingly, the genes ptsg and ptss, which encode the enzyme ii proteins for the uptake of glucose and sucrose, respectively, were also found to have an elevated expression level. to confirm the microarray results, subsequent real-time rt-pcr measurements were conducted, which validated the enhanced transcription of ptsg and ptss in the sugr mutant with ratios of  <dig>  and  <dig>  compared to res <dig>  respectively. beside the pts genes, the transcriptional levels of ldh and adha encoding lactate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively, were found to be significantly increased. significant increases in transcript levels were also observed for cg <dig> and cg <dig>  encoding hypothetical proteins. besides ldh and adha, no further genes with known function in carbon metabolism were found to be significantly induced.

 <dig> numbers in the genome database of the national center for biotechnology information 

since engels and wendisch  <cit>  also compared global transcript levels by microarray hybridizations in a sugr mutant and its parent strain, the resulting stimulon can be compared to the one obtained in this work. in the intersection of the genes showing elevated transcript levels in both experiments, only the pts genes mentioned above are apparent. the remaining genes corresponding to each stimulon are different between both studies and might be a result of the different growth conditions used  or might be results of an indirect effect of the derepression of pts gene transcription.

the sugr protein of c. glutamicum binds to sequences located upstream of the coding regions of ptsi, cg <dig>  ptsh, ptsg, and ptss
to verify the direct involvement of the sugr protein in the regulation of the pts gene cluster electrophoretic mobility shift assays  were performed. for these experiments the sugr protein was purified after overexpression in e. coli as an n-terminal translational fusion with a self-cleavable intein tag using the ptyb <dig> vector  <cit> . the advantage of this system is that the native protein can be obtained without an additional attached tag sequence. the quality of the purified protein was controlled by 1-dimensional sds-page and its size was estimated to be ~ <dig> kda. this observation is in accordance with the annotation of the sugr coding region, which is predicted to encode a  <dig>  kda protein with an n-terminal deor-domain comprising a helix-turn-helix  motif. the identity of sugr was subsequently confirmed by peptide mass fingerprinting using maldi-tof mass spectrometry .

as binding partners for sugr in the emsa experiments, overlapping and fluorescently-labeled pcr fragments from the intergenic regions between ptsi and cg <dig>  as well as the regions upstream from the coding regions of sugr, ptsh, ptsg, ptss, adha, cg <dig>  and cg <dig> were generated. as negative controls, internal dna fragments of the cg2118- and ptsh-coding region were also produced by pcr and incubated with the purified protein to test for non-specific binding of the protein .

for the gel retardation experiments  <dig> pmol of the sugr protein and  <dig>  pmol of the fluorescently-labeled pcr fragments were used. it was shown that sugr caused band-shifts in experiments with dna fragments i <dig>  i <dig>  and i <dig> located in the ptsi-cg <dig> intergenic region . furthermore, binding of the purified sugr protein was observed to the dna fragment h <dig> which is located upstream of the ptsh coding region, to the fragments g <dig> and g <dig> located upstream of the ptsg coding region and to the fragments s <dig> to s <dig> derived upstream of the coding region of ptss.

the promoter region of sugr was also tested for sugr binding, but no shifts of the labeled pcr fragments were detected . furthermore, labeled pcr fragments upstream of the cg <dig>  cg <dig>  and adha coding regions were tested in emsa experiments, but no binding of sugr was observed .

the c. glutamicum sugr repressor binds to two  <dig> bp dna regions interfering with ptsi and cg2118-fruk-ptsf transcription
as described above, sugr binding was detected to the dna fragments i <dig> and i <dig> located in the intergenic region between ptsi and cg <dig>  in contrast, no binding to the dna fragment i <dig> was observed. these observations helped to identify two genetic regions a and b which are proposed to carry the specific binding sites for sugr . region a is a  <dig> bp long sub-region of the dna fragment i <dig> and region b is a  <dig> bp long sub-region of i <dig>  dna sequence comparison of regiona to regionb revealed highly similar sequences of  <dig> nucleotides in length. to confirm these motifs as putative sugr binding sequences, double-stranded-oligonucleotides perfectly matching the  <dig> nucleotides with four flanking basepairs, representing the original genomic sequence on both sides, were used in competitive emsa experiments and denoted as oligoa and oligob, respectively . interestingly, both oligonucleotides were able to displace the labeled dna fragment i <dig>  to further verify the binding sequence of sugr, ds-oligonucleotides with transversions of the four flanking basepairs of oligoa and oligob, resulted in oligoat and oligobt, respectively, which were used in additional emsa experiments . oligoat and oligobt, however, showed no differences in the competitory emsa experiments compared to oligoa and oligob, defining both  <dig> bp long binding motifs as sufficient for sugr binding. according to the localization of the two sugr binding motifs in regiona and regionb of the dna fragments i <dig> and i <dig>  respectively , these two motifs were named motifa and motifb.

subsequently, the positions of the two  <dig> bp sugr binding sequences motifa and motifb were mapped in the intergenic region between the coding regions of ptsi and cg <dig> . the two experimentally proven binding motifs in the intergenic region between ptsi and cg <dig> are located within pcg2118and downstream of pptsi , or downstream the pcg <dig>  respectively. due to the divergent orientation of the coding regions ptsi and cg <dig> and the overlapping transcripts from the promoters pcg2118and pptsi, binding of sugr to motifa will interfere with transcription from both promoters, whereas the binding of sugr to motifb will only interfere with the transcription from pcg <dig> 

to find additional binding sites of sugr, sequence alignments of motifa and motifb to the upstream coding regions of ptsh, ptsg and ptss were conducted. in these alignments, only dna regions which showed a band-shift in the emsa experiments were used.

by this, two putative binding motifs were found upstream of the coding regions of ptsh and ptsg and ptss namely ptsh <dig>  ptsh <dig> and ptsg <dig>  ptsg <dig> and ptss <dig>  ptss <dig> respectively . concluding, these experiments led to the identification of eight binding motifs. two validated sugr binding sequences motifa and motifb located in the intergenic region of ptsi and cg <dig>  as well as six putative binding motifs located upstream of the coding regions of ptsh, ptsg, and ptss. sequence alignments of all eight motifs revealed that the six nucleotides acaaac in the 5'- and the four nucleotides aaca in the 3'-region were well conserved . additionally, a predominant occurence was observed for cytosine and adenine nucleotides at positions  <dig> to  <dig> of the consensus motif. the characteristics of the putative consensus motif were determined as an a+c-rich and non-palindromic sequence .

the effectors fructose-1-phosphate, fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate, and glucose-6-phosphate influence the binding activity of the sugr repressor
in order to determine the effector substances influencing the activity of sugr, additional emsa experiments were carried out. in these experiments, the sugr-i <dig> complex was incubated with fructose-1-phosphate  which exclusively occurs when fructose is taken up by the fructose-specific pts. additionally, glucose-6-phosphate  occurring during the transport of glucose by the glucose-specific pts component ptsg, fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate  and fructose-6-phosphate , originating from the consumption of different sugars, as intermediates of glycolysis were used. furthermore, the non-phosphorylated substrates of ptsf and ptsg, fructose and glucose, respectively, as well as acetate were used.

a loss of sugr binding to the dna fragment i <dig> was observed to different extents using increasing concentrations of f-1-p, f- <dig> -p, and g-6-p . using f-1-p as effector substance a clear effect at concentrations equal to and exceeding  <dig> μm could be observed. in the case of f- <dig> -p, significantly higher concentrations of the effector substance  for resolving the sugr-i <dig> complex had to be applied. additionally, g-6-p showed significant influence on the sugr-i <dig> complex only at concentrations above  <dig> mm. the binding of sugr to the dna fragment i <dig> was not influenced by f-6-p concentrations up to  <dig> mm . additionally, no influence was observed on sugr binding using the non-phosphorylated sugars glucose and fructose as well as acetate at concentrations up to  <dig> mm .

discussion
the c. glutamicum regulatory gene sugr is involved in the repression of the pts genes
in an initial study four putative transcripts were identified by rt-pcr covering sugr and cg <dig>  which are co-transcribed, ptsi and ptsh, which are transcribed monocistronically, and the cg2118-fruk-ptsf operon. coherent with this was the experimental identification of four promoters upstream of the coding regions of sugr, ptsi, cg <dig>  and ptsh.

in the c. glutamicum strain res <dig> the transcript levels of ptsi, the cg2118-fruk-ptsf operon and of ptsh were considerably higher on the pts sugars glucose and fructose in comparison to the non-pts carbon source acetate. it is interesting to note, that the transcript levels of these five genes were moderately induced in glucose-grown cells, whereas in fructose-grown cells the transcript level of the cg2118-fruk-ptsf operon, specifically necessary for the transport and metabolism of fructose, was much stronger induced than that of the general pts genes ptsi and ptsh. this indicates a differential activation of transcription for the general and the fructose-specific part of the fructose-pts gene cluster.

microarray hybridizations comparing global transcript levels in the c. glutamicum sugr mutant lg <dig> and its parent strain, both grown on acetate, helped to confine the genes belonging to the stimulon of the lg <dig> mutant. for this, it was interesting to note that together with the genes of the fructose-pts cluster, the distantly located pts genes ptsg and ptss were also found to be derepressed in the sugr mutant. these results were subsequently verified by using the more sensitive real-time rt-pcr technique verifying the expansion of the putative sugr regulon to the non-clustered pts genes ptsg and ptss.

in a parallel study, engels and wendisch  <cit>  analyzed the same regulatory genes by constructing mutants and analysing effects on the regulation of pts genes. they initially focussed on transcriptional regulation of ptsg and showed that this gene was transcriptionally regulated by the product of the sugr gene. by using microarray analysis to compare the global transcription levels of the sugr mutant to the parental strain grown on lb medium, they also ensured that ptss and the genes cg <dig> and ptsf are under the same transcriptional control. however, in their study the gene carrying the regulatory function was named sugr. by our microarray results, we were able to extend the sugr regulon by adding fruk and the genes encoding the general part of the pts, ptsi and ptsh. hence, this work shows that all functionally characterized pts genes are under the control of the sugr regulator.

in our microarray analysis, differential regulation of the genes cg <dig> and cg <dig>  putatively encoding a pts component of a hitherto unknown function, was not detected. therefore, these genes might not be a part of the sugr regulon. in contrast to this, elevated transcript levels were detected for the genes cg <dig> and cg <dig>  encoding proteins of unknown function, and adha, putatively encoding a zn-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. but, emsa studies only confirmed the in vitro binding of sugr upstream to the according coding regions of the pts genes. the significant expression changes of cg <dig>  cg <dig>  and adha are therefore most likely indirect effects of the sugr mutation.

an autoregulation of sugr is unlikely, because real-time rt-pcr experiments showed only marginal deviations in the transcriptional regulation of the sugr-cg <dig> operon in the sugr mutant in comparison with its parent strain. coherent with this, binding of purified sugr protein upstream of the coding sequence of sugr was not detected.

the deor-type regulator sugr acts as a repressor on transcription of all pts genes in c. glutamicum
in electrophoretic mobility shift assays , binding of the native, purified sugr protein to dna fragments located upstream of the coding sequences of ptsi, ptsh, ptsg, ptss, and the cg2118-fruk-ptsf operon was detected. this result substantiated the identification of these genes as part of the sugr regulon. binding of sugr to its target genes occurs in the absence of effectors and transcription is negatively affected as described above. therefore, sugr acts as repressor of transcription on pts genes.

the results obtained in this work correlate well with the current knowledge, where deor-type regulators of gram-positive bacteria often act as repressor of sugar-specific pts genes responsible for the uptake and metabolism of sugars like fructose , lactose , and sorbose . in bacillus subtilis deor-type regulators are also involved in the transcriptional regulation of deoxyribonucleoside degradation  <cit> . the function of deor-type regulators was further investigated in the gram-negative organisms e. coli and salmonella enterica where they have transcriptional influences on non-pts operons involved in the metabolism of deoxyribose  <cit> . a common feature of the described deor-type regulators is the transcriptional control restricted to neighboring genes. solely the deor-type regulator deot of e. coli has potential target genes of various metabolic pathways distributed in diverse genetic loci and was designated as a master regulator  <cit> . in accordance to the distribution of the pts genes in the c. glutamicum genome, the sugr repressor can be designated as a pleitropic regulator of the pts genes.

the sugr binding site comprises a 21-base pair ac-rich motif
the sequence comparisons of the sugr binding motifs led to a putative consensus sequence, which consists of two conserved non-palindromic flanking regions and an ac-rich center region. the deor regulators described for e. coli , b. subtilis , and salmonella enterica   <cit>  are recognizing palindromic sequences, as well as the the deor-type regulator which is responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the fructose-pts gene cluster in streptococcus gordonii   <cit> . in addition the deor-type regulator of the fructose-pts gene cluster of lactococcus lactis  potentially binds to four repeating non-palindromic sequences  <cit> . the putative consensus sequence of the sugr binding site, however, neither shows significant similarity to the known palindromic binding sequences, nor to the non-palindromic sequences of deor-type repressors mentioned above.

in their parallel study, engels and wendisch  <cit>  studied the binding of sugr , modified and purified by an aminoterminal decahistidine tag, to the ptsg upstream region. by comparing the results obtained from emsa experiments using overlapping dna fragments, they confined the binding site to a  <dig> bp sequence in which they found an  <dig> nt motif  which is partly conserved in the upstream regions of ptss and cg <dig>  although the possibility remains that the sugr binding site is shorter than the  <dig> nucleotides as predicted here, the 8nt possibly involved in the binding of sugr as defined by engels and wendisch  <cit>  is included in a putative  <dig> nt sequence  postulated in this work.

the two experimentally determined sugr binding motifsa and b are located in the intergenic region between ptsi and cg <dig> and are therefore of special interest. on one hand, motifa is overlapping the promoter region of pcg2118and located downstream of pptsi, on the other hand motifb is located downstream the promoter pcg <dig>  the binding within or downstream the promoter region is common to transcriptional repressors  <cit> . therefore, the binding of sugr in the operator region of ptsi and cg <dig> apparently results in the repression of the transcription of the divergently orientated genes. even though the sugr binding sites upstream of the ptsg coding region, detected in the work of engels et al.  <cit>  and this work are located upstream the promoter pptsg, a spacing of  <dig> bp to the -35th nucleotide may be sufficient for transcriptional repression by sugr. however, the maximal repression of the deo operon in e. coli is produced by deor binding to three operator sequences which are overlapping and located upstream of the transcription start sites  <cit> , resulting in cooperative binding of different regulatory sequences leading to gene repression  <cit> . such behaviour is putatively not present in c. glutamicum since a sugr binding to dna fragments located between transcription and translation start  was not observed. however, further binding sites located in the coding region of ptsg were not ruled out by experimental approaches and therefore the repression of ptsg transcription by sugr remains unclear.

fructose-1-phosphate and other sugar phosphates act as effectors releasing sugr from its binding sites
the strong effect of f-1-p on sugr binding to the ptsi-cg <dig> intergenic region is very interesting, since f-1-p is a metabolite mainly occuring during the uptake of fructose mediated by ptsf. therefore, f-1-p is an ideal intracellular substance for sensing the presence of external fructose and efficiently induces expression of the genes encoding the general and fructose-specific parts of the pts, ptsi, ptsh, and ptsf, respectively. once external fructose is consumed, the f-1-p concentration is reduced by the activity of 1-phosphofructokinase encoded by fruk converting f-1-p to the less effective metabolite f- <dig> -p. although, the internal concentration of f-1-p in c. glutamicum grown on glucose or fructose is unknown, the internal concentrations of the effector substances g-6-p could be determined to  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm and of f- <dig> -p to  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm grown on glucose or fructose, respectively. comparing the internal amounts of g-6-p and f- <dig> -p to the amounts used for the emsa-studies suggests that sugr is negatively influenced by theses effectors in vivo. during the consumption of the f- <dig> -p pool, the regulatory system might return to a maximal repressed state. the effector substance f-1-p was also shown to specifically affect the global regulator cra of e. coli  <cit> . it is furthermore described as the main effector for the frur repressors of the fructose operon in streptococcus gordonii  <cit>  and spiroplasma citri  <cit> .

besides the intermediate occuring during the consumption of glucose and fructose, namely f- <dig> -p, the product of glucose uptake via the pts, namely g-6-p, is apparently able to affect sugr binding activity and to derepress transcription of the pts genes. this would be necessary at least for the genes of the general part of the pts  and for the distantly located ptsg gene. however, much higher concentrations of f- <dig> -p or g-6-p are necessary for resolving the dna-sugr protein complex. these results were confirmed by the rt-pcr data for the wildtype, where the transcription of the fructose-pts cluster genes of cells grown on glucose did not reach the induction levels of cells grown on fructose, indicating higher activity of sugr on glucose then on fructose and resulting in higher induction levels of the fructose-pts cluster genes on fructose.

as a striking difference, engels and wendisch  <cit>  identified f-6-p as the only effector of sugr  when bound to the ptsg upstream region. f-6-p is the successive metabolic intermediate produced from g-6-p by the phosphoglucose isomerase. therefore, f-6-p is a suitable candidate for the cell to determine whether glucose is externally available.

in the experiments performed with the ptsi-cg <dig> intergenic region, no effect on sugr binding was observed for f-6-p up to concentrations exceeding  <dig> mm, which were applied for full resolution of the complex between sugr  and the ptsg upstream region in the study of engels and wendisch  <cit> . however, internal concentrations of  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm f-6-p were determined for c. glutamicum grown on glucose and fructose, respectively  <cit> , ranging below the amounts used for the emsa studies here.

in addition, the divergent promoters pptsi and pcg2118are coordinately regulated as shown by the mrna measurements in the sugr mutant compared to the parental strain. however, divergently transcribed genes were already described, e.g. for the c. glutamicum genes acea and aceb  <cit> . the corresponding promoters partly overlap by their - <dig> region and regulation of the divergent genes acea and aceb is obtained by binding of the regulator ramb to one binding site located in the intergenic region  <cit> . hence, switching between the repressive and the activated state is coordinately triggered. nevertheless, the acea and aceb promoters are only overlapping by their promoter sequence. the promoters pptsi and pcg2118are producing transcripts, which are complementary by  <dig> nucleotides, whereby the overlapping mrna transcripts do not influence the regulatory coupling of the divergent genes ptsi and cg <dig>  but represent a hence unique promotor structure in c. glutamicum.

as mentioned above, binding of sugr to motifb only interferes with cg2118-fruk-ptsf transcription providing the opportunity for the cell to differentially regulate expression of the fructose-specific part, and the ptsi and ptsh gene of the general part of the pts as observed for fructose and glucose grown cells. in detail, the expression of the pts gene cluster in c. glutamicum grown on acetate was compared to the one on fructose and glucose, respectively, indicates that the complete gene cluster is derepressed in the presence of glucose. in the presence of fructose, however, the expression of the fructose-specific genes fruk and ptsf is significantly higher than the expression of ptsi and ptsh. therefore, the level of the transcription from pcg2118is somehow further adjusted by the actual carbon source, whereas the transcription from pptsi and pptsh remains unaffected. at the moment it is not clear how this differential regulation, affecting the transcription from pcg <dig>  is exerted. it is possible that the sugr-dna complexes react differentially to different effectors as it is shown for the sugr  binding site upstream of the coding region of ptsg  <cit> . this differential behaviour might be interpreted in a sense that sugr is able to form complexes with individual binding sites that have different sensitivities to sugar phosphates. a sugar specific regulation of different genes was also observed in the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus furiosus, where the transcriptional regulator of the trehalose/maltose and the maltodextrin abc transporter trmb is inactivated by the effectors maltose and trehalose or maltotriose and sucrose, respectively  <cit> . however, the regulation of different genes by recognition of varying effectors could be an adequate explanation for the differing effectors determined by engels  <cit>  and this work. furthermore, it can not be excluded that other regulators may play a role in the differential expression of the pts gene cluster. the function of the second deor-type regulator gene located in the pts gene cluster cg <dig> in transcriptional regulation of the pts gene cluster remained unclear. the deletion mutant of cg <dig>  however, showed no influence on transcription of the pts genes under the tested conditions, therefore leaving the potential targets of cg <dig> unknown. however, a sugr/cg <dig> double mutant  was constructed and investigated with rt-pcr compared to the sugr single mutant, but no further induction of the transcription levels were observed for the fructose pts cluster genes when both strains were grown on fructose or acetate . furthermore, the cg <dig> protein was purified by the impact-method described and emsa-studies were carried out with the intergenic region of ptsi/cg <dig> and the upstream region of ptsh. binding of cg <dig> to the corresponding dna-fragments was not detected . further microarray experiments with the deletion mutant of cg <dig> will be a subject of further studies and may reveal the function and the regulon of cg <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the detailed investigation of the transcriptional regulation revealed the deor-type regulator sugr to be responsible for the repression of the fructose-pts cluster genes ptsi, cg <dig>  fruk, ptsf, and ptsh, as well as of the distantly located pts-genes ptsg and ptss. these results were confirmed by the determined promotor and sugr-binding sequences, extending the knowledge on pts-dependent transcriptional regulation.

the main negative effector of sugr with regard to the fructose-pts genes , was different to that identified in the study concentrating on the regulation of ptsg  by engels and wendisch  <cit> . in combination, these results indicated that sugr is able to regulate genes in dependence on the presence of different effectors, reflecting a hitherto unknown regulatory mechanism in corynebacteria.

it remains to be assessed whether the arrangement and sequence composition of the sugr-binding sites are responsible for the recognition of different effectors by sugr. further experiments dealing with the mutational analyses of the sugr-binding sites could clarify this issue.
