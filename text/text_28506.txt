BACKGROUND
patients with cystic fibrosis  are threatened over their lifetime with multiple respiratory infections contributing significantly to their morbidity and mortality  <cit> . one of the most problematic infectious agents are the microorganisms belonging to the burkholderia cepacia complex , a group of nine closely related bacterial species initially designated as genomovars prior to their formal naming  <cit> . current species within the bcc are: b. cepacia , b. multivorans , b. cenocepacia , b. stabilis , b. vietnamiensis , b. dolosa , b. ambifaria , b. anthina  and b. pyrrocinia . although all bcc species can be isolated from cf respiratory samples  <cit> , two of them, b. cenocepacia and b. multivorans, are by far the most predominant, cumulatively accounting for approximately  <dig> – 98% of all bcc infections in cf  <cit> .

within b. cenocepacia, phylogenetic analysis of the reca gene sequence  <cit>  subdivides this species into four distinct clusters, iiia, iiib, iiic and iiid  <cit> . a fifth b. cenocepacia subgroup, iiie, has been described in multilocus sequence typing studies of the bcc  <cit> , however, the clustering of iiie isolates in all these studies has been very distinct from b. cenocepacia subgroups iiia to iiid. the classification of these isolates as b. cenocepacia iiie is now recognised to have been a mis-assignment  and they will be referred as bcc group e until their taxonomic position is formally resolved. epidemiological surveillance of b. cenocepacia cf infection has revealed the vast majority of cases to be caused by subgroups iiia  <cit>  and iiib  <cit> . clinical strains of iiid origin were originally reported from a single cf centre  <cit>  and to date no clinical iiic strains have been described  <cit> . in addition to nine established bcc species, other bcc-related groups with unidentified genomovar status have been described such as bcc group k  <cit>  and bcc groups  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> ; the phenotypic similarity of these novel groups with b. cenocepacia provides the potential for misidentification.

the need for accurate identification of bcc has led to the development of several pcr-based methods  <cit> , aimed at preventing the alarming rate of bcc misidentification based upon the use of standard phenotypic tests  <cit> . the house-keeping gene reca whose polymorphisms allowed the discrimination of all the bcc species  <cit>  has been found to be particularly convenient for the bcc identification purposes  <cit> . however, when the pcr targeting the reca is applied to detection of b. cenocepacia, it lacks the option to detect all isolates within this species in a single reaction. separate pcr primers have to be employed for each existing reca variant from the b. cenocepacia iiia and iiib phylogenetic subgroups  <cit> ; no pcr primers have been developed for iiic or iiid strains. multilocus sequence typing  analysis of seven house-keeping genes   <cit>  has now largely superseded reca gene analysis in terms of being a gold standard test for discriminatory species or novel group identification within the bcc. mlst also has the great advantage of being capable of globally tracking and discriminating strains  <cit> . however, despite the fact that dna sequence analysis is becoming more cost effective and accessible, the requirement for pcr and sequencing of seven genes is often beyond the means of standard diagnostic laboratories.

in this study we developed a pcr for simultaneous detection of all clinically relevant b. cenocepacia reca groups – iiia, iiib and iiid  <cit> . we analyzed nucleotide polymorphisms of two additional essential genes, parb and repa, from the second chromosomal replicon of bcc bacteria which are involved in the partitioning and replication, respectively, of their multipartite genomes  <cit> . alignment of parb and repa genes from six sequenced bcc genomes enabled the design of universal pcr primers capable of amplification of each respective gene from all bcc bacteria. these pcrs were then used to generate bcc sequence datasets for each gene. after subsequent detection and comparison of discriminatory nucleotide polymorphisms, the final design of a b. cenocepacia species-specific repa pcr was carried out. the availability of a collection of parb and repa sequences also allowed us to evaluate for the first time the genetic and evolutionary conservation of the second chromosome that is carried by all members of the bcc  <cit> . the design of parb/repa pcrs, diagnostic evaluation of the performance of a b. cenocepacia-specific repa against a gold-standard set of isolates identified by mlst  <cit> , and the evolutionary specificity of the second chromosome to each discrete bcc species are described.

RESULTS
analysis of repa and parb genes encoded in bcc genomes
six bcc genomes that spanned b. cenocepacia, b. vietnamiensis, b. ambifaria and bcc group k were examined for the presence of repa and parb genes. due to the multireplicon structure of bcc genomes that are known to comprise at least  <dig> chromosomal replicons and may have one or more associated plasmids  <cit> , homologs of both genes were present in multiple copies. for all bcc genomes examined, all replicons possessed their own sequence-specific copy of parb, and every replicon except the largest , harboured a sequence-specific copy of repa. phylogenetic analysis of the repa and parb sequences retrieved from the second and third chromosomal replicons was performed . alleles for both genes clustered primarily by the replicon they were encoded on. within these replicon-specific clusters, each species was resolved as a discrete phylogenetic arm, with the three b. cenocepacia derived sequences clustering more closely than the bcc group k, b. vietnamiensis or b. ambifaria sequences. the repa and parb sequences on the respective plasmids within b. cenocepacia j <dig> and hi <dig> were also resolved and not as closely related as the chromosomally encoded genes.

the repa and parb genes present on chromosome  <dig> were selected for evaluation as targets to which both universal and b. cenocepacia specific pcrs could be designed. using the alignment of full length bcc genes, universal primers were designed to amplify 66% of the  <dig>  bp repa coding sequence and 62% of the  <dig>  bp parb sequence present on the second chromosome ; these primers were applied to collection of strains representative of the genetic diversity within the bcc identified by mlst  <cit> . sequence analysis of an internal  <dig> bp portion of  <dig> bp repa product was performed using two further primers, while the shorter,  <dig> bp long parb amplicon was sequenced completely using the universal primers for this gene .

sequence analysis of the bcc repa gene
the relationship and sequence similarities among repa alleles originating from different bcc species was investigated for  <dig> bcc st types. phylogenetic analyses of repa  revealed that b. cenocepacia reca groups iiia and iiib clustered in close proximity to each other, indicating they might share unique sequence polymorphisms not present in other bcc species/groups. the variation in repa alleles from b. cenocepacia iiib was considerably greater than that seen in iiia strains which were virtually identical for the  <dig> sts examined. b. cenocepacia iiic and iiid, along with two bcc <dig> strains of distinct st clustered adjacent to iiia and iiib; a third bcc <dig> st formed the next most closely related arm of the tree . these five groups split weakly from all other bcc species examined on the basis of the repa phylogeny.

the sequence length obtained from a subgroup of  <dig> isolates representing  <dig> st types was suitable for mlst-like analysis. in an analogous fashion to the allele numbering system used in mlst  <cit> , a unique number was assigned to every repa sequence variant and resulted in identification of  <dig> new repa alleles . none of the repa alleles was able to further distinguish a single st type and all isolates of the same st always carried the same repa allele. moreover, the same repa allele numbers were found shared by multiple sts within the same species. these data indicated the repa gene was more conserved than the gltb, gyrb, lepa and trpb genes used in conventional mlst of the bcc.

phylogenetic analysis of parb gene
the parb gene polymorphisms were examined in  <dig> different sts, including same isolates used for repa analysis above. the constructed phylogenetic tree for parb  demonstrated considerably weaker relatedness between b. cenocepacia iiia and iiib compared to the repa tree. iiia and iiib were not found next to each other and in addition, iiib isolates were split into three separate parb clusters. b. cepacia, bcc group k, bcc group e, bcc <dig>  bcc <dig> and bcc <dig>  were clustered between iiia and the three iiib subgroups. this pronounced phylogenetic diversity showed that there was substantial sequence heterogeneity within the parb gene. application of the mlst-like allele designation system to the parb gene of  <dig> isolates  resulted in the identification of  <dig> different alleles . similarly to the repa results, identical alleles were found present in more than one st and the isolates of the same st never differed by their parb allele. however, only one of the  <dig> mlst loci, gyrb, exceeded the number of different alleles found in parb.

design of pcr for b. cenocepacia iiia, iiib and iiid
one of the aims of this study was to develop a single species-specific pcr for b. cenocepacia, primarily aimed at unifying the identification of the most clinically significant groups iiia and iiib that exist within this species. after obtaining the repa and parb sequence datasets which spanned the current diversity within the bcc, both genes were evaluated for their potential as pcr targets. however, the high degree of parb sequence heterogeneity within the iiib group excluded this gene from being evaluated further as a suitable target.

in this respect, the repa proved to be less troublesome and allowed the design of b. cenocepacia-specific primers. however, even within repa, two sites with species-specific nucleotide polymorphisms had to be selected to avoid false positivity deriving from non-iiia non-iiib isolates. the first species-specific polymorphism site selected was targeted by primer repa-237- <dig> ; this primer had priming base mis-matches in the repa sequences of b. cepacia, b. multivorans, b. cenocepacia reca group iiic, b. stabilis, b. vietnamiensis, b. dolosa, b. ambifaria, b. anthina, b. pyrrocinia, bcc group k, bcc group e and bcc <dig>  primer repa-237- <dig> in combination with the sequencing forward primer repa-seq- <dig> was predicted to produce a  <dig> bp product with iiia, iiib, and bcc <dig> while the mis-matched species described above were predicted to be negative. the second site selected for the multiplex pcr was targeted by primer repa-636- <dig>  and containing priming basis mis-matches present in the repa sequences of b. multivorans, b. cenocepacia iiic and bcc5; in combination with repa-seq- <dig>  primer repa-636- <dig> was therefore predicted to produce a  <dig> bp product from all bcc species except the latter three.

as a combined multiplex pcr, with repa-seq- <dig> as the forward primer and a mixture of repa-237-3/repa-636- <dig> as the reverse primers, the predicted identification algorithm from the in silico analysis was as follows: b. cenocepacia iiia and iiib isolates would produce both  <dig> and  <dig> bp pcr products; b. cenocepacia iiic and b. multivorans would be negative for both; bcc <dig> would produce only the  <dig> bp product, while all the remaining bcc species and novel groups would produce only the  <dig> bp amplicon. at this stage, we could not predict outcomes for bcc <dig>  and b. cenocepacia iiid . however, since we were mainly focused on the specific detection of b. cenocepacia iiia and iiib as predominant cf pathogens, the multiplex pcr was tested on a group of  <dig> isolates spanning the diversity of the bcc . as predicted, b. cenocepacia reca groups iiia and iiib were characterized with two positive bands, and in addition subgroup iiid was also positive for both of these. b. cenocepacia iiic and b. multivorans were negative for both pcr products and bcc <dig> produced the  <dig> bp product alone. all the remaining bcc members were positive for just the  <dig> bp amplicon .

specificity and sensitivity of b. cenocepacia pcr
the initial success of the multiplex prompted a complete screen of a broad range of different sts representing all bcc species and most of recently described bcc groups which was used to determine specificity and sensitivity of the multiplex pcr. the hypothesis tested was that the novel repa pcr was capable of discriminating b. cenocepacia iiia, iiib and iiid from all other bcc species and novel groups . for b. cenocepacia iiia, iiib and iiid, all  <dig> isolates  gave the expected double-positive pcr result. all  <dig> b. cenocepacia iiic isolates  were negative. outside of b. cenocepacia,  <dig> isolates  from formally named species within the current b. cepacia complex produced results that correlated to their species designation . the only exceptions were  <dig> isolates representing  <dig> st from b. vietnamiensis, b. ambifaria and b. pyrrocinia, respectively, that were negative for both multiplex products . expansion of the test strain collection to novel bcc groups with no formal species names demonstrated the presence of b. cenocepacia iii-a-b-d-like double positives only among  <dig> sts in group bcc <dig>  three sts within the  <dig> bcc <dig> isolates tested produced single  <dig> bp amplicons as expected, however, the remaining  <dig> sts were negative for both amplicons. the other novel groups screened all produced the expected multiplex pcr result.

in total,  <dig> out of  <dig> sts were assigned correctly into one of the two categories:  being b. cenocepacia iiia, iiib or iiid , and  being other bcc species or groups . this represented 100% test sensitivity  and overall  <dig> % specificity . the species-specific character of the assay was also further tested by examining amplification from closely related non-burkholderia species and bacteria commonly encountered in cf sputum ; all these micro-organisms did not cross-react with novel multiplex pcr and designed primers. the detection threshold of the pcr which comprised just  <dig> cycles was found to be  <dig> b. cenocepacia cfu/ml; addition of  <dig> further pcr cycles reduced the minimal amount of bacteria needed for successful amplification to  <dig> cfu/ml.

the number of isolates and sts for each bcc group or species is shown. certain sts within these groups produced the opposite repa multiplex pcr result to that expected for either the  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp product; the number of sts and the pcr result for these non-conforming strains are indicated in brackets.

discussion
correct identification of bacteria belonging to the b. cepacia complex still remains dependent on the use of molecular methods. the non-ribosomal house-keeping gene reca has become one of the mainstays of bcc identification, since its sequence polymorphisms allow both detection of the whole complex and also species level identification  <cit> . however, one of the major drawbacks of using the reca gene was the fact that b. cenocepacia is split into four reca phylogenetic variants  <cit> . as a consequence, b. cenocepacia lacks a one-step identification test, even though this particular species represents the most frequent bcc pathogen in persons with cf  <cit> . a single test for unified identification of b. cenocepacia isolates, especially the clinically dominant subgroups iiia and iiib  <cit> , would be a great asset to the rapid diagnosis of infection caused with these virulent cf pathogens. in this study we examined the nucleotide polymorphisms present in the essential house-keeping genes repa and parb, which are involved in the control of replication and partitioning, respectively, of the multiple chromosomal replicons present in bcc genomes  <cit> .

of these two genes, repa was the most suitable for the design of the identification method. the successful repa multiplex pcr developed was capable of identifying b. cenocepacia strains iiia, iiib and iiid; also its testing represents the first time a single identification test had been compared to a reference collection of bcc strains identified and typed by mlst. the repa multiplex pcr method was primarily designed to detect the two main b. cenocepacia reca groups iiia and iiib, however, its efficacy for the identification of b. cenocepacia iiid should prove clinically useful. as opposed to b. cenocepacia iiic which is entirely comprised of the environmental isolates which are specialist plant endophytes  <cit> , reca groups iiia, iiib and iiid all include clinical isolates of b. cenocepacia  <cit>  and therefore are the most likely to be encountered in clinical microbiology practice.

the pcr method was tested on  <dig> different st types. its sensitivity reached 100% within the target groups of b. cenocepacia iiia, iiib and iiid, while specificity was found at 93% due to several strains from the bcc <dig> producing the same pcr result as b. cenocepacia. eight different bcc groups of unassigned species status  were included in the study making the strain collection examined one of the most broad in terms of bcc diversity. while the group k has already been shown to potentially comprise more than one bacterial unit analogous to the species level  <cit> , the taxonomic positions of other bcc groups remain unanswered. however, a recent study describing the bcc groups  <dig> and  <dig> for the first time  <cit> , showed that bcc <dig> was very closely related to b. cenocepacia reca groups iiia and iiib suggesting their same species origin. our pcr was able to detect  <dig> out of the  <dig> sts examined within bcc <dig> . although this detection rate was below 50% it may prove useful in the future if bcc <dig> is assigned to b. cenocepacia. in contrast we were able to eliminate the positivity of bcc <dig> during the design of the repa-based pcr. although bcc <dig> has been proposed to be closely related to b. cenocepacia , with repa analysis two bcc <dig> isolates clustered most closely to b. cenocepacia iiic and iiid, and a third isolate formed a distinct arm . phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated sequences from seven mlst loci also show even closer links to b. stabilis and b. pyrrocinia rather than b. cenocepacia iiia or iiib  <cit>  suggesting that resolution of the taxonomic status of bcc <dig> will require further analysis.

the detection limit experiment demonstrated that the repa pcr was able to detect approximately  <dig> cfu/ml b. cenocepacia from a pure culture after  <dig> cycles of pcr. a similar detection limit has been observed with the standard reca gene pcr for b. cepacia complex bacteria  <cit> . once chronically infected, large numbers of b. cepacia complex bacteria may be present in cf sputum . the sensitivity of the repa pcr seen in this study indicates that without modification, it could only be applied directly to sputum for the most heavily infected individuals. however, our previous studies have shown that by nesting a reca gene-based pcr as low as  <dig> cfu/ml of bcc bacteria may be directly detected from cf sputum and identify individuals that are culture negative, but show early evidence of being infected  <cit> . since we have now shown that repa is an accurate b. cenocepacia identification target, the design of future nested pcrs based on this gene may be undertaken. overall, the repa pcr as developed herein is most suited to application on pure bcc cultures and the specific identification of b. cenocepacia iiia, iiib and iiid.

sequence analysis of repa as well as of another partitioning gene parb revealed that a degree of their sequence conservation was comparable with other house-keeping genes used for mlst. parb was more polymorphic than repa as the number of identified alleles within it was the second largest identified after mlst locus gyrb. lower variation of the b. cenocepacia repa was observed in phylogenetic analysis where, unlike parb, b. cenocepacia iiib formed a uniform single cluster which was adjacent to b. cenocepacia iiia . overall the repa tree closely mirrored the phylogenetic relatedness of the bcc members observed by concatenated nucleotide sequences from seven mlst loci  <cit> . phylogenetic trees of parb  or reca  <cit>  do not clearly identify this close b. cenocepacia iiia-iiib relatedness.

our analysis has also enabled us to speculate on the evolution of the multireplicon b. cepacia complex genome. an intriguing question of bcc genomic biology is: has chromosomal replicon movement occurred between species? while considerable genomic plasticity mediated by insertion sequences and the capacity of strains to survive deletion of over  <dig> kb of dna from secondary replicons has been shown for bcc bacteria  <cit> , we do not know if they are capable of swapping replicons between species. examination of the full length repa and parb genes from complete bcc genomes demonstrated clustering by chromosomal replicon, while each species possessed genetically distinct replication regions within these major clusters . this suggests that the second and third chromosomes present in bcc each have a distinct common ancestor that was present in the bcc progenitor prior to its divergence into the closely related species that currently make up the complex. although we found evidence of different strains of a species  sharing a given repa or parb allele, we did not find any that were shared by different bcc species. these data suggest that the second chromosomal replicon has not moved between bcc species and was evolutionary stabilised a long time ago such that it diverged in concert with their emergence as new species. it also indicates that the partitioning and replication regions of bcc bacteria are highly stable and essential, such that inter-species recombination which has been observed for several bcc mlst loci  <cit>  does not occur in these regions.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have developed easy-to-use single pcr method that is capable of unifying the detection of all b. cenocepacia strains except for reca subgroup iiic. the repa gene targeted by this assay possesses sequence polymorphisms that enable bcc species clustering which closely mirrors that provided by mlst and making repa a stable and discriminatory gene for the development of diagnostics of bcc infection. we have also shown the second and third chromosomal replicons possessed by these bacteria have evolved stably with each respective bcc species and that replicon movement has not occurred after their speciation.
