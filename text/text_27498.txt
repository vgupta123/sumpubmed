BACKGROUND
recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of a large number of transcripts originating from regions of the genome previously thought to be silent
 <cit> . one major challenge arising from these observations is to determine whether these transcripts code for a protein or should be classified as non-coding rnas. this task is rather overwhelming, since a majority of these transcripts only have the potential to encode small proteins, generally less than  <dig> amino acids 
 <cit> . historically, an arbitrary cutoff for open reading frames of  <dig> aa was applied in genome annotation projects
 <cit>  and thus the extent and functional significance of small open reading frames  remains a largely unexplored territory in many organisms. nevertheless, copious reports clearly indicate that they play crucial biological roles, including protection against pathogens
 <cit> , signal transduction
 <cit> , serving as molecular chaperones
 <cit> , developmental regulation
 <cit>  and even calcium transport in cardiac muscle contraction
 <cit> .

several proteins encoded by sorfs have been identified serendipitously by biochemical methods as part of a complex or the product of a processed precursor protein. one example is the drosophila tarsal-less  gene, originally annotated as non-coding, but later shown to encode three small proteins with a crucial role in fly development
 <cit> . several studies have used genome-wide approaches to gauge the prevalence of sorfs. when examining potential small proteins in drosophila melanogaster, ladoukakis et al. identified  <dig>  sorfs that were conserved in a closely related species, drosophila pseudoobscura <cit> . synteny, evidence of transcription and nucleotide substitution, narrowed the  <dig>  to a more conservative estimate of  <dig> sorfs. a study on the arabidopsis small proteome assessed evolutionary conservation and examined evidence of transcription to predict the expression of as many as  <dig>  sorfs
 <cit> . a report on the mammalian small proteome by frith et al. used fantom cdna data to identify a potential  <dig>  sorfs using a critica gene-detection program
 <cit> . additionally,  <dig> sorfs were gfp-tagged and, following transfection into cells,  <dig> of the fusion proteins were detected, providing evidence of translation
 <cit> . more recently, using a novel combination of peptidomics and rna-sequencing , slavoff et al. identified  <dig> novel small proteins in humans and two were tagged and shown to localize to the mitochondria and cytoplasm
 <cit> . nevertheless, to date few functional studies of proteins encoded by sorfs have been performed. in yeast,  <dig> small proteins were tested by generating gene deletions and  <dig> had an effect on saccharomyces cerevisiae growth under various conditions
 <cit> , whereas overexpression of  <dig> small proteins in arabidopsis resulted in  <dig> recognizable phenotypes
 <cit> .

mass spectrometry, a powerful technique in proteomics to validate the existence of putative protein candidates, has been applied in several studies
 <cit> . high-resolution mass spectrometry provides very accurate precursor ion masses and combined with stringent statistical methods enhances the certainty of peptide identification
 <cit> . this is a key issue in the validation of newly identified sorfs. in general, a protein database derived from the genome is used in shotgun proteomics to identify peptides and proteins from mass spectrometric raw data, but six frame translation of the genome is also frequently employed
 <cit> . in either case, the certainty of the existence of any protein can be increased by an observed corresponding rna transcript. recently, we used a combination of stringent methods, that is, ribosome footprinting, next generation sequencing and advanced mass spectrometric technology, to discover a plethora of novel sorfs in cytomegalovirus, many of which we determined to exist at the protein level
 <cit> .

the question of whether functional small proteins exist is particularly relevant in organisms with a tightly organized genome, such as the parasitic protozoan trypanosoma brucei. protein-coding genes are arranged in long unidirectional clusters with intergenic regions only a few hundred nucleotides in length, thus leaving little space for sorfs or non-coding rnas. the initial sequencing and annotation of the  <dig> megabase-sized chromosomes, published in  <dig>  predicted  <dig>  protein-coding genes
 <cit> . as of november  <dig>  this number has increased to  <dig>  ; however, a major challenge remains to identify all expressed proteins. this quest was addressed by several rna-seq studies using illumina high-throughput cdna sequencing
 <cit> . in particular, we provided evidence that the coding potential of the t. brucei genome was larger than originally anticipated by identifying  <dig>  transcripts mapping to regions of the genome with no annotated orfs
 <cit> . a total of  <dig> of these transcripts have the potential to contain a coding sequence  of at least  <dig> amino acids and the remaining  <dig> transcripts either have no coding potential at all or no orf larger than  <dig> nucleotides. however, it remains to be established whether these transcripts encode functional proteins.

founded on the set of transcripts identified by our transcriptome analysis
 <cit> , we applied bioinformatics approaches to identify small proteins conserved across kinetoplastid species and representative eukaryotes. combined with mass spectrometry data, we pinpointed  <dig> high-confidence small proteins ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. rnai-knockdown revealed seven essential proteins in the insect-stage of the life cycle and their diverse subcellular localizations suggested involvement in many aspects of t. brucei biology.

RESULTS
t. brucei transcripts encoding evolutionarily conserved potential small proteins
we previously published a single-nucleotide resolution genomic map of the t. brucei transcriptome, which included  <dig>  transcripts not originating from annotated cds  sequence read archive - sra at
 <cit>  - under accession no. sra <dig> and the  <dig>  transcripts are accessible through a community file, tbrucei_novel_transcripts.fasta, on tritrypdb at
 <cit> ). after a reexamination of this data set using the latest t. brucei genome annotation , we excluded  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts coding for snornas and annotated proteins larger than  <dig> amino acids, respectively, and added two novel transcripts coding for proteins identified by mass spectrometry  data . setting a lower limit of  <dig> aa,  <dig> of the remaining transcripts contain between one  and  <dig>  orfs for a total of  <dig>  orfs [see additional file
1]. eighty transcripts were classified as non-coding rnas, since the predicted orfs were less than  <dig> nucleotides. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the latter category has coding potential by using alternative initiation codons or encoding proteins smaller than  <dig> aa.
t. brucei 
transcripts not coinciding with annotated coding sequences .

the selected  <dig>  orfs were highly enriched in short orfs , that is, less than  <dig> amino acids, with  <dig>  orfs  falling into this category [see additional file
2: figure s1]. since proteins encoded by sorfs largely escape standard genome annotations, we examined evolutionary conservation in combination with computational approaches to screen for orfs conserved in kinetoplastidae and representative eukaryotes as a benchmark for protein expression. kinetoplastid protists belong to the phylum euglenozoa and include a significant number of disease-causing parasites, such as t. brucei and t. cruzi, the causative agent of african trypanosomiasis and chagas disease, respectively, and the old and new world leishmania parasites, which cause various forms of leishmaniasis worldwide. first, we conducted basic local alignment search tool  analyses
 <cit>  of kinetoplastid genomes and annotated proteins, excluding the t. brucei subspecies . of the  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> encoded one orf that was conserved in at least one kinetoplastid organism and four transcripts  encoded between two and twelve conserved orfs for a total of  <dig> conserved orfs [see additional file
3]. second, we compared the selected  <dig>  orfs to the annotated proteins from representative eukaryotes, namely s. cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans, arabidopsis thaliana, d. melanogaster, mus musculus and homo sapiens. we found that  <dig> orfs had significant alignments with blast bit scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  with  <dig> coding for ribosomal proteins [see additional file
4]. it is worth noting that these  <dig> orfs were part of the set conserved in kinetoplastids. we next surveyed the  <dig> conserved orfs for known protein domain using the cd-search tool  and detected domains in  <dig> orfs covering a broad spectrum [see additional file
5]. however, the ribosomal protein superfamily , various zn finger domains  and the rna recognition motif  superfamily  were overrepresented. finally, our analysis of signalp
 <cit>  and tmhmm
 <cit>  predictions revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> potential small proteins have a predicted signal peptide and that a considerable number  have a predicted trans-membrane domain with seven having more than one predicted domain.

identification of small protein candidates through mass spectrometry data
for an alternative approach based on peptide evidence to recognize transcripts coding for small proteins, we surveyed ms data  for peptides matching the  <dig>  selected orfs described above. as reported previously
 <cit> , searching the proteome data of panigrahi et al.
 <cit>  provided evidence for the expression of  <dig> small proteins, with all  <dig> being part of the  <dig> small protein candidates identified bioinformatically. in addition, ms data from butter et al.
 <cit>  and this study revealed  <dig> hits. as well as providing validation for  <dig> of the  <dig> small protein candidates, our data also predicted five small proteins specific to t. brucei with no recognizable homologues in other kinetoplastids. we also performed a search against hexatranslations of the trypanosome genome, which revealed the same set of newly identified proteins . taken together, we were able to provide supporting ms data for  <dig> predicted small proteins with  <dig> being represented in more than one ms data set, and, except for the t. brucei-specific hits, all the other matches were among the evolutionarily conserved  <dig> small protein candidates [see additional file
3].

the  <dig> small protein candidates with supporting ms data were filtered further by removing predicted ribosomal proteins or annotated proteins with a predicted function and cds with multiple copies in the genome, leaving us with  <dig> small proteins for further analysis [see additional file
3]. this final group of selected proteins ranges in size from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and  <dig> qualify as small proteins. transcript lengths vary from  <dig> to  <dig>  nucleotides and the average 5’ utr length is  <dig> nucleotides with a median of  <dig> nucleotides. this is similar to the global analysis of the transcriptome
 <cit> , where a median length of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides was reported. on the other hand, the 3’ utr is on average  <dig> nucleotides long with a median of  <dig> nucleotides, with the latter being notably smaller than the medians reported in the aforementioned transcriptome studies, namely  <dig> nucleotides
 <cit>  and  <dig> nucleotides
 <cit> .

noteworthy characteristics of this collection of  <dig> small proteins are as follows: three have putative homologues in representative eukaryotes ; predicted domains include two rrms and two zn-finger domains; sixteen have a predicted trans-membrane domain; and one has a predicted signal peptide [see additional file
3].

rnai screen of the  <dig> small proteins revealed  <dig> to be essential in the insect life-cycle stage
rnai knock-down strategies have revolutionized the functional analysis of genes in t. brucei <cit> . mrna degradation is triggered most efficiently by double-stranded rna  produced in vivo as a hairpin rna transcribed from a tetracycline-inducible promoter. thus, we generated a hairpin construct for each of the  <dig> orfs using the ptryprnaigate plasmid
 <cit> . each construct was stably integrated in the non-transcribed rrna spacer region of a special procyclic-form recipient strain, named  <dig> . <dig>  expressing the tet repressor and t <dig> rna polymerase
 <cit> , and clonal cell lines were established. upon rnai induction with tetracycline,  <dig> had a growth phenotype that differed from un-induced control cells. three of the knockdowns resulted in a slow-growth phenotype. for example, rnai of tb <dig> nt. <dig> resulted in a cell division time of 16 hours as compared to  <dig>  hours for un-induced cells and this phenotype was not accompanied by noticeable changes in cell morphology [see additional file
2: figure s2]. in addition, knockdown of two small proteins  resulted in faster growth with no obvious changes in cell morphology [see additional file
2: figure s2]. monitoring cell growth after rnai induction of the remaining seven revealed that all cell lines stopped dividing and eventually died demonstrating that tb <dig> nt. <dig>  tb <dig> nt. <dig>  tb <dig> nt. <dig>  tb <dig> nt. <dig>  tb <dig> nt. <dig>  tb <dig> nt. <dig> and tb <dig> nt. <dig> are essential genes . for subsequent analyses we focused on the seven essential predicted small proteins and the rnai knockdowns revealing a change in the doubling time were not pursued further.

to confirm that the observed essentiality of the seven small proteins was specific to rnai knockdown of the predicted transcript, we performed the following experiments. first, we verified the transcript length expected by the rna-seq data
 <cit>  using northern blot analysis. in six of the seven cases a single predominant hybridizing band was detected and the observed size matched the predicted size within the limits of resolution of northern blotting [see additional file
2: figure s4]. the seventh transcript, tb <dig> nt. <dig>  had two bands detected by northern blot. one band corresponded to the size of the predicted novel transcript of  <dig> nucleotides. further interrogation by northern blotting and rt-pcr with probes specific for the upstream  and downstream annotated gene  led us to conclude that the longer rna contained both tb <dig> nt. <dig> and the downstream transcript encoding a component of the t. brucei u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein . this finding was reminiscent of the presence of an upstream open reading frame  described in organisms from fungi to humans
 <cit> . uorfs are defined as predominantly short orfs found in the 5’ utr of a previously annotated gene and experiments are ongoing to investigate whether tb <dig> nt. <dig> qualifies as an uorf.

second, semi-quantitative rt-pcr verified that the knockdown of the seven essential transcripts was efficient [see additional file
2: figure s5]. third, to confirm the specificity of the rnai knockdown, we set out to rescue each lethal phenotype with the expression of an rnai-resistant construct. to do this, the cds targeted by rnai was assembled as a synthetic sequence bearing at least one silent mutation per  <dig> contiguous base-pairs
 <cit>  and flanked by heterologous utr sequences . in addition, an ha-tev-flag epitope tag or a gfp tag was added to the c-terminus [see additional file
2: figure s6]. upon co-expression of the hairpin targeting the endogenous transcript and the corresponding modified cds in a stable cell line, the endogenous transcript was destroyed, as shown by rt-pcr, and in all seven cases the cells survived on the rnai-resistant transcript encoding the same small protein [see additional file
2: figure s3]. these results led us to conclude that the essential phenotype was a direct consequence of the knockdown of the targeted cds.

initial characterization of the essential small proteins
the rnai rescue experiments described above established that the epitope-tagged small proteins were functional and, thus, could be used for biochemical and cell biological experiments. using fluorescence microscopy we detected expression of all seven small proteins  and western blot analysis confirmed that the proteins had the predicted relative molecular mass [see additional file
2: figure s7]. tb <dig> nt. <dig> and tb <dig> nt. <dig> revealed a fluorescence pattern typical of the procyclic trypanosome branched tubular mitochondrion . tb <dig> nt. <dig> appeared to be a surface protein, an observation supported by subsequent experiments . by immunofluorescence, three proteins  were shown to be enriched in the cytoplasm, with tb <dig> nt. <dig> distributed throughout this compartment, whereas tb <dig> nt. <dig> and tb <dig> nt. <dig> appeared somewhat concentrated around the nucleus. finally, tb <dig> nt. <dig> had a distinct localization in the nucleus, possibly indicative of the nucleolus.

since t. brucei undergoes extensive morphological and metabolic changes during its life cycle alternating between the mammalian  and insect  hosts, it was of interest to gauge the essentiality of the seven small proteins in bloodstream forms. thus, the hairpin constructs were transfected into a bloodstream form cell line competent for rnai and, following induction, tb <dig> nt. <dig>  a potential surface protein, and tb <dig> nt. <dig>  a probable mitochondrial protein, were shown to be essential in this stage of the life cycle . growth curves for the five nonessential proteins can be found in figure 
3c and additional file
2: figure s <dig>  based on the above results, we selected tb <dig> nt. <dig>  tb <dig> nt. <dig> and tb <dig> nt. <dig> for further analysis.

tb <dig> nt.29: a putative surface protein
the  <dig> nucleotide-long tb <dig> nt. <dig> transcript encodes a  <dig> aa protein, which is highly conserved in kinetoplastids  and has a predicted trans-membrane domain . initial immunofluorescence suggested that tb <dig> nt. <dig> might be localized on the surface . to address this possibility, we compared the signal for cells expressing epitope-tagged tb <dig> nt. <dig> that were either permeabilized by detergent prior to antibody exposure or remained non-permeabilized. under permeabilized conditions we detected both tb <dig> nt. <dig> and the endoplasmic reticulum  protein bip . however, when we omitted the permeabilization step, thus limiting access of antibodies to potential surface molecules, no signal was detected for bip, whereas the signal for tb <dig> nt. <dig> was still visible . this behavior was similar to procyclin , a well-characterized t. brucei surface protein specific for the procyclic life-cycle stage
 <cit> . since the epitope tag was at the c-terminus of the tb <dig> nt. <dig>  this result also suggested that this portion of the protein was exposed on the surface. to corroborate this localization, we performed cell fractionation experiments and by western blot analysis tb <dig> nt. <dig> was enriched in the membrane fraction, similar to procyclin, whereas hsp <dig> was, as expected, enriched in the cytoplasmic fraction .

to begin to probe the potential role of tb <dig> nt. <dig>  we monitored the effect of rnai knockdown on cell cycle progression and cell morphology. in procyclic cells rnai resulted in a slowdown in growth after two days followed by cell death between day five and six post-induction , whereas the rnai effect was more pronounced in bloodstream form cells with cell death occurring between day one and two . for cell cycle analysis in procyclics, parasites were stained with hoechst at various time points after induction and the number and position of nuclei and kinetoplasts  in each cell were recorded. cells with one kinetoplast and one nucleus  are in g <dig> of the cell cycle, cells with two kinetoplasts and one nucleus  have segregated the kinetoplast and are at the end of s phase, and cells with two kinetoplasts and two nuclei  have completed mitosis and are poised for cytokinesis
 <cit> . any other arrangement is aberrant and might point to defects in cell cycle progression. in wild-type cells, as expected for an asynchronously growing cell population, the majority of parasites will be 1k1n with about 10% of cells having either a 2k1n or 2k2n configuration.

rnai-induced down-regulation of tb <dig> nt. <dig> in procyclics resulted in the accumulation of cells containing either 1k2n or 1k0n, the latter referred to as zoids . zoids and 1k2n cells increased nearly equally in number and after three days of induction they comprised  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the cell population, respectively. several morphological changes were observed after the knockdown, including flagellar detachment both as specific areas of separation between the cell membrane and the flagellum, and complete separation with only one visible contact point between the cell body and flagellum . we also noted a change in the shape of the cell body that appeared to be specific to 2k1n or 2k2n cells. after kinetoplast replication and separation, a narrowing of the cell body was evident between the two daughter kinetoplasts , which might indicate a defect in cytokinesis.

tb <dig> nt.28: a mitochondrial inner membrane protein
the 56-amino acid tb <dig> nt. <dig> protein is 45% identical between t. brucei and l. major and contains a predicted trans-membrane domain . initial immunofluorescence staining revealed a similar localization pattern between tb <dig> nt. <dig> and the fluorescent dye mitotracker red, a cell-permeable mitochondrion selective probe . cell fractionation experiments corroborated the potential mitochondrial localization in that tb <dig> nt. <dig> was enriched in the mitochondrial fraction similar to rna-editing associated protein , a known mitochondrial marker
 <cit> , whereas the cytoplasmic hsp <dig> was excluded from this fraction . to determine in which mitochondrial compartment tb <dig> nt. <dig> might be localized, we exposed whole cells to increasing concentrations of digitonin, a detergent that preferentially solubilizes the plasma membrane and the outer membrane of the mitochondria. as the digitonin concentration is increased, specific mitochondrial compartments have been shown to be solubilized with  <dig> % digitonin releasing proteins from the inter-membrane space,  <dig> % digitonin solubilizing matrix proteins,  <dig> % digitonin resulting in release of outer membrane proteins and  <dig> % digitonin solubilizing inner membrane proteins
 <cit> . as tb <dig> nt. <dig> was only released upon exposure to  <dig> % digitonin, its likely localization is the inner membrane , since solubilization of trypanosome alternative oxidase , a known inner membrane protein of t. brucei mitochondria
 <cit> , occurred with the same digitonin concentration, whereas a portion of mitochondrial hsp <dig>  a matrix protein, was released with as little as  <dig> % digitonin.

rnai-induced knockdown of tb <dig> nt. <dig> resulted in cell death in procyclic forms , but did not affect growth in bloodstream forms . an analysis of cell cycle progression in the procyclic cells following rnai did not result in an accumulation of cells containing aberrant dna amounts. however, a steady increase in the number of 2k1n cells was observed with this cell type constituting one third of all cells four days post-induction . in this category, 50% of cells had duplicated the kinetoplast, but the daughter kinetoplast remained linked in a dumbbell-shaped body, a larger number than seen in wild-type cells
 <cit> . this indicated that although cells entered s phase it had not been completed.
 <dig> 

tb <dig> nt.87: a mitochondrial matrix protein
tb <dig> nt. <dig>  a very basic protein of  <dig> aa, is highly conserved in kinetoplastids except for the first  <dig> aa . performing fluorescence microscopy on live cells expressing the gfp-tagged rnai-resistant construct revealed similar localization patterns between tb <dig> nt. <dig> and mitotracker, indicative of a mitochondrial localization . cell fractionation experiments were consistent with the immunofluorescence data  and digitonin solubilization assays, as described above, suggested that tb <dig> nt. <dig> was a matrix protein, since the solubilization properties were similar to mitochondrial hsp <dig>  an established marker for the matrix . to further pinpoint its cellular localization, we used immunogold electron microscopy of cells expressing ha-tev-flag tagged tb <dig> nt. <dig>  micrographs of thin sections showed that the protein was in the mitochondrial matrix and its distribution appeared to be uniform .

tb <dig> nt. <dig> was shown to be essential in both procyclic and bloodstream forms  and a significant increase in cells with more than two nuclei and grossly enlarged cell bodies was noted after knockdown of tb <dig> nt. <dig> in procyclics . after four days of induction,  <dig> % of cells had between three and eight nuclei. most of these cells contained a single kinetoplast, indicating that although mitosis was occurring there was not a corresponding replication and division of mitochondrial dna. the enlarged cell body remained as one unit with a single flagellum as expected in a cell with one kinetoplast. a substantial number of zoids  and 1k2n cells  also accumulated by this time point. in accordance with the presence of a single kinetoplast in many cells containing multiple nuclei, a potential defect in kdna replication was further manifested by the appearance of cells with small kdna or no detectable kdna . for example, after three days of tb <dig> nt. <dig> rnai, 32% of cells had normal-sized kdna, whereas 65% of the cells were scored as having a small kdna.

discussion
although genome sequencing projects have provided a wealth of information about genome structure and organization, they also encountered a challenge to catalogue all protein-coding genes. since gene annotation programs do not perform well in predicting small proteins, that is, less than  <dig> aa, it has been common practice to set an artificial length cutoff of  <dig> aa to avoid flawed predictions. however, recent computational and functional studies highlighted the existence and importance of small proteins in numerous organisms
 <cit> . our approach to gauge the extent of the small proteome in t. brucei integrated experimental data  and evolutionary conservation. starting with  <dig>  transcribed sequences not mapping to an annotated cds
 <cit> ,  <dig> have the potential to code for one or more proteins of at least  <dig> amino acids. this data set was then examined for conserved proteins in related kinetoplastids and representative eukaryotes. a similar strategy was applied in yeast, where more than 60% of the  <dig> small proteins identified had significant similarities with annotated proteins in other eukaryotes, including humans
 <cit> . likewise, an analysis of the m. musculus small proteome revealed that two-thirds of the potential sorfs identified were conserved in rat and 50% were conserved in human
 <cit> . in contrast, only  <dig> %  of the predicted orfs in t. brucei had potential homologues in representative eukaryotes, with half of them coding for ribosomal proteins. one possible explanation for this stark difference in evolutionary conservation might be the early divergence of t. brucei from other eukaryotes. we observed a comparable lack of conservation when searching for potential homologues in related kinetoplastid species:  <dig> %  of the  <dig> transcripts have predicted orfs with a significant homology to annotated proteins or a six-frame translation of the available genomes. this result was somewhat unexpected, since more than half of the small proteins identified in arabidopsis had homologues in four closely related plants
 <cit>  and more than  <dig>  sorfs were found to be conserved between d. melanogaster and a closely related species, d. pseudoobscura <cit> . on the other hand, since it has been argued that conservation in closely related species is evidence for translation, the  <dig> small proteins identified by evolutionary conservation might represent a substantial proportion of the small proteome. the currently available ms data support this view, since the peptide hits were largely confined to the set of  <dig> proteins. the only exception was the identification of five t. brucei-specific proteins. thus, to fully expose the catalogue of small proteins, future approaches will have to concentrate on the identification of t. brucei-specific orfs through ms analysis or ribosome profiling
 <cit> .

examining the functional importance of small proteins in yeast, revealed that  <dig>  of  <dig> sorf knockout cell lines had an essential phenotype in specific growth conditions
 <cit>  while in arabidopsis, overexpression of 10% of a handpicked set of almost  <dig> small proteins resulted in an abnormal phenotype
 <cit> . our results showed that  <dig> % of the orfs tested were essential in procyclic cells, while an additional 12% altered normal growth patterns. for example, tb <dig> nt. <dig> was essential in procyclics but not in bloodstream-form parasites. we further provided evidence that this small protein of  <dig> amino acids is likely localized to the inner membrane of the mitochondria. in t. brucei, both the size and activity of the mitochondria vary dramatically between life cycle stages. in the bloodstream form, mitochondrial respiratory activity is repressed and a single tubule of the organelle is maintained. on the other hand, in procyclic cells the mitochondrion forms an extensive, branching network and has active respiration. although further experiments will be required to elucidate the function of tb <dig> nt. <dig>  examination of cell cycle progression following rnai induction revealed a decreased ability of the cells to divide replicated kinetoplasts. in contrast, tb <dig> nt. <dig>  a mitochondrial matrix protein of  <dig> amino acids, is essential in both procyclic- and bloodstream-form parasites. ablation of this protein in procyclics resulted in the accumulation of cells containing multiple nuclei and a single kinetoplast, as well as cells with small or no kinetoplast, suggesting that kinetoplast replication is impaired. a similar scenario was observed in bloodstream-form cells upon rnai of tb <dig> nt. <dig> . the basic nature of tb <dig> nt. <dig>  is intriguing and will need further investigation. nevertheless, our current data are consistent with tb <dig> nt. <dig> playing a role in kinetoplast replication, which is an essential process in both life cycle stages
 <cit> . finally, tb <dig> nt. <dig>  indispensable in both procyclic and bloodstream stages, is most likely localized on the cell surface. two days post-induction cells appeared with an asymmetrical hourglass shape and a kinetoplast sequestered in the smaller half of the cell, while the remaining portion contains 1k1n or 1k2n. the proportional accumulation of zoids and 1k2n cells that began after these cells arose suggested that an aberrant cytokinesis of these asymmetrical hourglass cells occurred.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides evidence for the existence and importance of small proteins in the human pathogen t. brucei. at the same time, it is somewhat puzzling that an unexpectedly low number of transcripts not matching annotated proteins or having conservation with closely related species were identified as containing functional orfs. even though there may be small proteins expressed at low levels not yet detectable by ms and others that might be expressed at specific stages of the life cycle, it is tempting to speculate that the t. brucei transcriptome includes a substantial number of non-coding rnas. as all the small proteins identified as essential are unique to kinetoplastids, they may become new targets to block the survival of trypanosomes in the insect vector and/or the mammalian host. the next important question to be tackled is the mechanism of action of these small proteins.
