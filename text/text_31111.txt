BACKGROUND
the genus petunia resides within the solanaceae family and contains  <dig> species and subspecies that are native to south america  <cit> . petunia × hybrida  is an important ornamental crop plant and represents a hybrid species derived in the nineteenth century from a cross between p. axillaris and p. integrifolia  <cit> . subsequent breeding has introgressed traits from additional petunia spp. that, together with natural variation resulting from mutations in key genes, have contributed to the wide diversity in plant and floral morphology and flower color that exists within the pool of commercially available germplasm . in cool climates in the northern hemisphere, petunia is often produced in greenhouses during the winter months for distribution to spring markets once it reaches an optimal size and begins to flower  <cit> . therefore, a high percentage of the cost of crop production is related to energy consumption and growers are often faced with the dilemma of either reducing greenhouse temperatures, thereby extending the growing time of the crop and incurring increased labor costs, or elevating the growing temperature and increasing energy costs but reducing the duration of crop growth  <cit> . thus, understanding the factors that impact crop timing traits may facilitate the selection of petunia varieties with an increased rate of vegetative node formation  at either optimal or suboptimal growing temperatures, or varieties that initiate flowering following emergence of fewer leaf nodes. we have previously documented that accessions of p. axillaris and p. integrifolia possess increased development rate when compared to a diverse pool of commercial petunia germplasm, suggesting genetic variation for this trait within the genus  <cit> . this was confirmed in an interspecific f <dig> population of a cross between p. axillaris and p. integrifolia that identified three quantitative trait loci  on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that affected development rate and explained 34 % of the observed variation  <cit> . the molecular basis underlying these qtl remains to be identified.

the genetic determinants of development rate, often referred to as plastochron, are multifaceted, complex and not fully understood but are, at least in part, linked to hormonal control of meristem size and activity. for example, transgenic tobacco  plants with increased cytokinin oxidase activity and a concomitant reduction in cytokinin levels displayed reduced meristem size and delayed plastochron when compared to wild type  <cit> . similarly, characterization of arabidopsis mutants with reduced auxin levels and disrupted auxin transport also influence plastochron . in addition, mutations at the plastochron  <dig> and plastochron  <dig> loci of rice, which encode a cytochrome p <dig> of unknown function and a mei2-like rna binding protein homolog, respectively, also influence development rate but do so independently of each other  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the squamosa promoter binding protein-like  transcription factors spl <dig> and spl <dig> act redundantly to influence plastochron and over-expression of mir <dig>  which targets multiple spls, shortens plastochron  <cit> . analogous to the relationship of the plastochron  <dig> and  <dig> loci of rice  <cit> , the spl/mir <dig> regulatory module acts independently of cyp78a5/kluh, which is a putative ortholog of rice plastochron  <dig>  <cit> . the involvement of the mirna pathway in influencing plastochron is further supported by the characterization of the serrate and altered meristem program  mutants of arabidopsis, which display reduced and increased rates of leaf initiation, respectively . serrate encodes a zinc finger protein required for mirna biogenesis and rna splicing while amp <dig> associates with argonaute <dig> at the endoplasmic reticulum and is required for translation inhibition through the exclusion of mirna target mrnas from polysomes  <cit> . furthermore, mutations in amp <dig> homologs in maize and rice confer similar pleiotropic phenotypes to those exhibited by arabidopsis amp <dig> mutants, including altered plastochron  <cit> . together, these data suggest complex regulation of plastochron that involves different regulatory modules, including hormone and mirna pathways.

the development of next generation sequencing technology has revolutionized biology and in particular, transcriptome sequencing provides a cost effective strategy for generating sequence and expression information from the gene space of non-model organisms or from species with large complex genomes  <cit> . in plants, transcriptome sequencing has facilitated gene discovery, the development of molecular markers and large scale analyses of genetic variation . despite the economic and biological importance of petunia, genomic information and molecular marker resources for this genus are limited , single nucleotide polymorphism  markers are currently unavailable and marker assisted selection is rarely utilized. in addition, although transcriptome resources are available for petunia, they are not extensive and most often are derived from the cultivated species p. hybrida or from specialized tissue types . herein, de novo assembly of reference transcriptomes of p. axillaris, p. integrifolia and p. exserta, derived from paired-end rnaseq analysis of five diverse tissues  is reported. tissue types were selected to attempt to maximize the number of transcripts recovered while generating resources for studying traits of interest related to development and metabolism. these resources were utilized to develop a set of snp, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  and simple sequence repeat  markers that will facilitate qtl mapping and gene discovery for multiple traits within the genus, including those associated with development rate.

RESULTS
transcriptome assembly and annotation
transcriptome sequencing of five tissue libraries, including callus, flowers, shoot apex, seedlings, and trichomes, from p. axillaris, p. exserta, and p. integrifolia yielded between ~ <dig> and 294 m 100 nt reads, of which greater than 94 % passed quality and trimming filters . a two-step de novo assembly strategy  modified from  <cit>  resulted in  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  transcripts ≥ 500 bp respectively, for p. axillaris, p. exserta, and p. integrifolia. the two-step assembly strategy was employed to eliminate redundant reads in the flower and trichome libraries already present in the callus, shoot apex, and seedling libraries to aid the quality of the assembly.table  <dig> description of petunia spp. tissues, libraries, and rna-seq data

the n <dig> value for each assembly was greater than  <dig> and average transcript sizes of  <dig> for p. axillaris,  <dig> for p. exserta, and  <dig> for p. integrifolia were obtained. the distribution of transcript sizes follows the same trend in each of the three species with the largest number of transcripts falling within the size bins of 500–1000 bp, and between  <dig> and 1500 bp . cegma analysis  <cit>  revealed that full length copies of >91 % of the highly conserved eukaryotic genes are present in each of the transcriptome assemblies while partial sequences are present for almost 100 % of these genes . these data are similar to those reported for other plant transcriptome assemblies  <cit> . all high quality raw reads from each of the five libraries were also mapped back to their respective assembly with bowtie and tophat  <cit>  generating mapping rates of  <dig>  % for p. axillaris,  <dig>  % for p. exserta, and  <dig>  % for p. integrifolia.fig.  <dig> quality metrics of the petunia spp. transcriptome assemblies. a size distribution of assembled transcripts. b cegma completeness assessment of the transcriptome assemblies. c percentage of p. axillaris, p. exserta, and p. integrifolia unigenes with assigned functional annotations from uniref <dig>  tair <dig>  refseq, the pfam domain database, and ncbi genbank non-redundant protein set. in addition, the total percentage of annotated unigenes per species is presented



for p. axillaris and p. exserta, the majority of representative transcripts comprised a single isoform whereas approximately 60 % of p. integrifolia transcripts possessed multiple isoforms . where multiple isoforms were identified, the median number was two for p. axillaris and p. exserta, and three for p. integrifolia. the longest isoform was selected as the representative transcript yielding a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  representative transcripts in p. axillaris, p. exserta, and p. integrifolia, respectively. these transcripts covered between ~ <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp of the transcriptome space . the increased number of transcripts retrieved from the p. integrifolia assembly together with a higher number of transcripts with multiple isoforms, is likely the result of widespread heterozygosity within this species due to self-incompatibility  <cit> .table  <dig> total number of de novo assembled transcripts in each of the petunia axillaris, p. exserta, and p. integrifolia transcriptomes in relation to the number of representative transcripts and their total coverage of the transcriptome space

representative transcripts from each assembly were annotated using blastx searches against five publically available databases . adopting quality thresholds of ≥30 % coverage and ≥70 % identity resulted in an annotation rate of approximately 70 % , with the largest number of annotations retrieved from the refseq and ncbi non-redundant databases. similar rates of annotation were reported for transcriptome assemblies of chickpea and red clover  <cit> . in addition, of the  <dig> predicted petunia proteins available in genbank, ~89 % are present in the p. axillaris, p. exserta, and p. integrifolia transcriptome assemblies.

open reading frames  were extracted from the representative transcripts and the predicted protein sequences were searched for orthologous gene clusters using orthomcl  <cit> . among all comparisons, approximately  <dig>  orthologous clusters were identified, with p. axillaris, p. exserta, and p. integrifolia sharing  <dig>  clusters . a larger number of orthologous clusters were found between p. axillaris and p. exserta, likely due to their closer phylogenetic relationship  <cit> . while p. integrifolia was found to house over double the number of unique clusters . in addition, gene ontology  annotations  of the representative transcripts showed highly equivalent representation of biological process categories among the three species, indicating the uniformity of the transcriptome assemblies and their subsequent annotation .fig.  <dig> orthomcl identified orthologous gene clusters in the three petunia species. a total of  <dig>  orthologous clusters were identified among all comparisons. unique and species specific orthomcl clusters are shown

snp detection and characterization
in the absence of whole genome sequences, comparative transcriptome analysis has proven utility for developing snp markers  <cit> . to facilitate genetic analysis within the genus, the three petunia spp. transcriptomes were utilized for snp discovery using the genome analysis toolkit   <cit> . when utilizing rna-seq data for snp discovery, removal of duplicate reads increases snp detection sensitivity and specificity  <cit> , thus this strategy was adopted resulting in utilization of  <dig>  % of p. axillaris,  <dig>  % of p. exserta and  <dig>  % of p. integrifolia reads that uniquely mapped to the p. axillaris transcriptome . depth of sequence coverage increases the reliability of snp detection  <cit>  and utilization of a minimum threshold for read coverage depth of  <dig> resulted in mapping of  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the reads for p. axillaris, p. exserta, and p. integrifolia, respectively .table  <dig> summary of read depth coverage for petunia axillaris, p. exserta, and p. integrifolia reads mapped to the p. axillaris transcriptome assembly after de-duplication

overall, there were  <dig>  snps between the three species. of these,  <dig>  were located in 5ʹ untranslated regions ,  <dig>  were located within the coding sequence , and  <dig>  were located in 3ʹutrs. snp frequency was calculated by dividing the total length of the reference transcriptome by the total number of snps. when only considering the length of 5ʹutrs, cds, and 3ʹutrs in transcripts , the snp frequencies were  <dig> snp/69 bp,  <dig> snp/61 bp and  <dig> snp/62 bp in these regions, respectively. the overall snp frequency was  <dig> snp/63 bp.

after filtering, among the  <dig>  representative p. axillaris transcripts , we identified snps between p. axillaris and either p. exserta or p. integrifolia in  <dig>  unigenes. gene ontology  annotation revealed that among all unigenes,  <dig>   contained go terms, while  <dig>   of the snp-containing unigenes were assigned with one or more go id . in general, the distribution of go terms was very similar between all unigenes and those containing snps. kegg pathway analysis was carried out to determine functional categorization of unigenes containing snps. a total of  <dig>  unigenes containing snps were annotated by  <dig> ko  identifiers by using only references appropriate for plant species . these unigenes were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. overall, the snp frequency for genes involved in metabolism and organismal systems super pathways was lower than those involved in genetic information processing and environmental information processing.table  <dig> kaas  analysis of super pathways involving snp-containing transcripts

in total,  <dig>  snp positions were detected among p. axillaris, p. exserta and p. integrifolia. of these,  <dig>  were polymorphic across all three species combinations. this calculation was based on positions for which at least one species, p. integrifolia or p. exserta, had sufficient depth of coverage . after removing low depth of coverage snps,  <dig>  snps remained between p. axillaris and p. integrifolia,  <dig>  snps remained between p. axillaris and p. exserta, and  <dig>  snps remained between p. exserta and p. integrifolia. .fig.  <dig> summary of snp loci between three petunia spp. a total number of snp loci between p. axillaris, p. exserta and p. integrifolia; b number of homozygous snp loci between p. axillaris, p. exserta and p. integrifolia. the intersecting portions of the venn diagram illustrate the number of common loci between the comparisons



snps were further classified based on their location; cds or utr and their zygosity. altogether, only  <dig> homozygous snps were polymorphic across all three species combinations . between p. axillaris and p. exserta,  <dig>  snps were homozygous, which comprised  <dig>  % of all snps. there were  <dig>  homozygous snps, 17 % of the total snp positions, between p. exserta and p. integrifolia. between p. integrifolia and p. axillaris, there were only  <dig> homozygous snps, which constituted only  <dig>  % of all polymorphisms, indicating that the self-incompatible p. integrifolia is highly heterozygous. of all snp loci,  <dig>  were located within the cds, of which  <dig>  were biallelic;  <dig> were located within 5ʹutrs, of which  <dig> were biallelic;  <dig>  were located within 3ʹutrs, of which  <dig>  were biallelic. there is a small group of  <dig> snps whose location could not be determined.

as with the unfiltered snps, snp frequency was calculated by dividing the total length of the reference transcriptome  by the total number of snps . overall, the snp frequency was 1/597 bp. the snp frequency was 1/2056 bp between p. axillaris and p. exserta, 1/726 bp between p. axillaris and p. integrifolia, and 1/669 bp between p. integrifolia and p. exserta. all snps among the three species were distributed across  <dig>  unigenes , corresponding to ~76 %  of the entire unigene length. when only considering the unigenes containing snps, the overall snp frequency was  <dig> snp/456 bp  and the highest snp frequency was 1/89 bp. among the snp-containing unigenes, only  <dig>  had  <dig> or more snps . this suggests that the snps were broadly distributed across the transcriptome, which might facilitate snp marker selection for genome wide association  studies.table  <dig> snp frequency, the number of unigenes which contain snps, and percentage of the total unigene length for all three species combinations

snps between p. axillaris and p. exserta were distributed across  <dig>  unigenes . there were only  <dig> unigenes with  <dig> or more snps. the maximum snp frequency per unigene was  <dig> snp/111 bp. between p. axillaris and p. integrifolia, snps were identified in  <dig>  unigenes. there were  <dig> unigenes with  <dig> or more snps. the maximum snp frequency per unigene was  <dig> snp/96 bp. there were  <dig>  unigenes with snps between p. integrifolia and p. exserta, and  <dig> unigenes with more than  <dig> snps. the maximum snp frequency per unigene was 1/89 bp.

due to the stringent nature of the snp discovery parameters employed , the above snp frequencies calculated after the filtering steps are likely underestimated. additionally, for organisms without a fully sequenced genome, using a transcriptome de novo assembly followed by variant detection can result in underestimation of expressed variants  <cit> . even with the collection of different tissue types in our study, there are still likely to be undetected variants.

the percentage of unigenes with ten or more snps was  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the entire snp-containing unigene set between p. axillaris and p. exserta, p. axillaris and p. integrifolia, and p. integrifolia and p. exserta, respectively . on average, there were  <dig>  snps/transcript, with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps/transcript between p. axillaris and p. integrifolia, p. axillaris and p. exserta, and p. integrifolia and p. exserta, respectively. when evaluating the transcripts with more than ten snps for go annotation, the gene percentage in each category was in proportion with the overall transcriptome go annotation , indicating no particular set of genes were enriched regarding snp frequency.fig.  <dig> distribution of transcripts with different number of snps. the x-axis indicates the number of snps within each transcript and the y-axis indicates the number of transcripts within the category. the percentage on top of each bar indicates the percentage of total transcripts fall into the category. all – all three species, a × e , i × a , i × e 



to gain additional insight into base substitutions occurring at each polymorphic site, the transition to transversion ratios  were determined . overall, the transition to transversion ratio  was  <dig> : <dig>  across all species comparisons, the ts/tv was consistently highest for snps within cds, followed by snps located in 3ʹutrs, while the ts/tv was always lowest for snps located in 5ʹutr. the overall ts/tv was relatively stable between species, with a range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the ts/tv ratio was used as a critical metric for assessing the specificity of new snp calls in human genome research  <cit> , and might be a useful parameter for subsequent petunia snp discovery. normally, assuming that mutations are completely random, the ts/tv would be  <dig> . our ts/tv data indicate that each type of transitional change is produced more than three times as often as each type of transversion. transitions occurring more frequently than transversions in transcriptome-derived snps have also been reported in other plant species, including chinese pine  <cit>  and melon  <cit> . the ts/tv bias could be the result of a high degree of methyl c to u in genomes  <cit> . in plants, ts/tv can vary across species. for example, in the exome assembly of four neotropical tree species, ts/tv varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . in the transcriptome from norway spruce, the ts/tv was around  <dig>  to  <dig>  depending on the sequencing quality cut-offs  <cit> . it has been suggested that a higher c↔t transition can be accompanied by a higher number of ts. the same situation was observed in our study. for instance, snps between p. integrifolia and p. axillaris, and between p. exserta and p. integrifolia, had a higher rate of c/t mutations than was observed between p. axillaris and p. exserta, which was accompanied by a slightly higher ts/tv.table  <dig> snp distribution and corresponding transition to transversion ratio  in coding regions , 5′utrs and 3′utrs

apercentage was calculated based on the total snp numbers



minor allele read count frequency was used to calculate the frequency of short reads aligned to the least common allele in all three genotypes. using a small number of genotypes for snp discovery, this measure should provide better support for snp confidence than using minor allele frequency , where the least prevalent allele frequency is calculated based on the genotype of each individual in a given population. for example, if there are only a few individuals in the panel, the smallest minor allele frequency will be 1/2n , in our case, the minimum maf would be  <dig>  %. however, the average depth of coverage was above  <dig>  and for rna-seq data, the preferentially expressed genes will have a much higher read depth. thus, even employing a depth cut-off value of  <dig>  a heterozygous genotype call could have one allele with a much higher read count than the other allele, which might actually be caused by sequencing error or misalignment. this can be detected using the minor allele read count frequency. snps with minor allele reads count frequency ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  accounted for 61 % of the total snps .fig.  <dig> minor allele reads count frequency distribution for snps among p. axillaris, p. exserta, and p. integrifolia




snp validation
a total of  <dig> primer pairs were selected for pcr amplification. of these,  <dig> amplified single dna fragments, containing a total of  <dig> snp loci, matching the expected sizes in p. axillaris and were selected for further sequencing . the failed/unclear amplification might be from primers located across intron-exon boundaries, or from the amplification being across a large intron or in paralogous genes. three of the loci were monomorphic, five yielded poor sequence quality, which was associated with either failure of the sequence reaction or ambiguous base calls that were likely due to heterozygosity of the parents that resulted in amplification of distinct alleles of a given locus. the remaining  <dig> loci were polymorphic between at least two species resulting in an overall snp validation rate of  <dig>  % . for the three monomorphic snp loci, the minor allele sequence read count frequencies were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , indicating that low minor allele sequence read count frequency might be one factor that can introduce false positives in snp identification. the validation rate obtained in this study is comparable with previously reported results for transcriptome derived snps. for example, the validation rate for pea  transcriptome derived snps was  <dig>  % by selecting a  <dig> snps set in a goldengate veracode assay on a large number of pea accessions  <cit> . the validation rate for the snp detected from douglas-fir  was  <dig>  %  <cit>  while, in potato, the validation rate was 85 % for set of  <dig> transcriptome derived snps  <cit> .

caps marker design and validation
twenty restriction enzymes were used to computationally predict caps markers from  <dig>  snp loci . some snp loci are predicted to be digested by two different restriction enzymes, with one recognizing the reference allele and the other recognizing the alternative allele, or by different restriction enzymes with overlapping recognition sequences. for example, for the restriction enzymes alui and saci, saci is a 6 bp cutter recognizing/cutting sequences of gagctˇc and alui is a 4 bp cutter that recognizes/cuts agˇct, thus all alui recognition cites are also recognized by saci. these analyses led to the identification of a total of  <dig>  predicted caps markers . fourteen putative caps markers were randomly selected for validation. all primer pairs amplified products of the expected size, and  <dig> were polymorphic. all  <dig> amplicons for p. axillaris and p. exserta had the expected genotype, while four amplicons from p. integrifolia were homozygous while the genotype prediction was heterozygous. however, the caps markers generated from this study have some limitations. first, the caps marker design pipeline only considered possible restriction enzyme recognition differences between species, the number/size of the fragments generated from digestion was not taken into consideration. thus, there might be multiple small fragments yielded from the digestion, or the digested fragments between genotypes may only vary by a few base pairs. either situation could not be scored successfully on agarose gel genotyping systems. second, there could be sequence differences between the p. axillaris reference genome and the actual parental genotype used for this study , and some restriction enzyme recognition sites predicted in the pipeline might not exist when screening our samples.

simple sequence repeat  marker development
of the  <dig>  p. axillaris unigenes,  <dig>  contain predicted ssrs, and  <dig>  of these possess more than one ssr . the ssr frequency in the p. axillaris transcriptome is approximately  <dig> ssr per  <dig>  kb, which is one-tenth of the snp frequency between p. axillaris, p. integrifolia and p. exserta. the ssr frequency in p. axillaris is lower than the frequency in cassava   <cit> , coffee   <cit>  and peanut    <cit> . among the p. axillaris ssrs, ~42 % are di-nucleotide repeats, of which ag/ct is most prevalent  and ~53 % are tri-nucleotide repeats with aag/ctt repeats present at the highest frequency .table  <dig> summary of ssr markers in the p. axillaris transcriptome



a total of  <dig> primer pairs were developed from  <dig> unigenes . the designed ssr primer pairs included  <dig>  di-,  <dig>  tri-,  <dig> tetra-,  <dig> penta-, and  <dig> hexa- nucleotide repeats . forty-eight ssr markers were randomly selected for their utility in petunia . of these,  <dig>  were successfully amplified and displayed polymorphisms between at least two of the three species examined. for example,  <dig> ssrs were polymorphic between p. integrifolia and p. axillaris,  <dig> were polymorphic between p. axillaris and p. exserta, and  <dig> were polymorphic between p. integrifolia and p. exserta. this success rate was higher than for our previous results developing ssr markers from p. axillaris ests  <cit> .

representation and in silico expression analysis of petunia plastochron-related transcripts
several genes from arabidopsis are known to influence plastochron . local tblastn searches of the petunia spp. transcriptomes using  <dig> arabidopsis plastochron-related proteins as the query sequences revealed the presence of highly homologous unigenes within each transcriptome . the majority  of the recovered transcripts are predicted to encode full-length proteins despite the fact that many plastochron-related genes, including erecta, erecta like- <dig>  serrate and slow motion, yield transcripts close to 3 kb or greater. based on predicted amino sequence alignments, an additional five unigenes appear to be truncated by approximately  <dig> nucleotides  or less at their n-termini . this targeted analysis supports the transcriptome wide assessment of quality using cegma analysis  and indicates an overall high quality assembly of each transcriptome. several of the previously characterized plastochron-related genes are preferentially expressed within the shoot apical meristem or developing leaf primordia  <cit> . congruent with these previous findings, among the plastochron-related homologs identified in petunia, those related to amp <dig>  erecta, pin <dig>  tel <dig>  kluh, serrate and spl <dig> display enriched expression within shoot apices compared to the additional tissues examined . these data suggest conservation of both gene content and expression pattern of plastochron-related genes between petunia and arabidopsis.table  <dig> petunia homologs of plastochron-related genes from arabidopsis

mapping plastochron-related homologous transcripts in an interspecific petunia population
we identified petunia transcripts homologous to numerous plastochron-related genes from arabidopsis . with the previously identified snps,  <dig> of these transcripts were converted to caps markers and used for linkage mapping . together with the previously published ssr and caps markers  <cit> , we constructed a linkage map with a total length of 289 cm consisting of  <dig> markers. of those, eight were caps markers developed from plastochron-related transcripts located on five chromosomes . the average linkage group length was  <dig>  cm with a range from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm . the average marker density was  <dig>  cm.

similar to our previous study  <cit> , three qtl for development rate located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were detected. together they explained 37 % of the variation for development rate . however, the qtl location on chromosome  <dig> shifted away from a caps marker developed from the isopentenyl transferase gene sho, a gene originally identified in an activation-tagged line exhibiting increased lateral shoot production  <cit> . we found that although markers developed from plastochron-related genes were located on the same chromosomes as two of the qtl, they did not co-localize with development rate qtl regions. linkage maps with higher resolution will help better understand the mechanisms for this trait.fig.  <dig> genetic linkage map of a p. integrifolia × p. axillaris f <dig> population. markers developed from plastochron-related genes are highlighted in red. qtl for development rate  are indicated along with the corresponding lod score along the linkage group

CONCLUSIONS
high quality transcriptome assemblies were generated by rna-seq data from three petunia spp. and these were mined for molecular markers and plastochron-related transcripts. we used a snp discovery pipeline to identify over  <dig>  snps across three species. as the majority of the snps were located in exons and over 80 % of the snp-containing transcripts can be annotated, these snps could possess utility in future gene discovery and breeding applications. thirteen percent of the identified snps were polymorphic among all three species, and can be further used for comparative genomics and population diversity studies. additionally, over  <dig>  snps were transformed into caps markers and an additional set of ssr markers were developed. plastochron-related transcripts were identified, converted to caps markers, and genetically mapped in a p. integrifolia × p. axillaris f <dig> population. overall, these data provide sequence, expression information and a large marker resource for the petunia community.
