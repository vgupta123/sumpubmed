BACKGROUND
major histocompatibility complex  molecules play a key role in initiating immune responses. they bind to and expose an antigen  to t cell receptors  triggering an immune response against the infected cell or foreign agent. mhc molecules make multiple contacts with the side-chains of binding peptides, which define the binding motif and determine the specificity of binding  <cit> . prediction of peptides binding to a mhc class ii molecule is difficult due to different types of side chains and because the length of the binding peptides is longer than 9aa   <cit> . it has been previously observed that a core of 9aa is sufficient for binding peptides to a mhc class ii molecules  <cit> , however, the exact location of the binding core  within the peptide is usually unknown and vary.

a binding motif is usually represented either by a consensus sequence or as a weight matrix  <cit> . the presence or composition of a motif can be experimentally determined from a large pool of putative binding peptides  <cit> . however, such wet-lab experiments are costly, time consuming, and cumbersome. amino acids at specific sites of a motif, contributing significantly to the binding are referred to as primary anchor residues and the corresponding sites as anchor positions. by using such position-specific information, earlier studies have found weight matrix models elaborating the nature and strength of binding motifs  <cit> . these models offer binding strengths of every residue at specific sites in the form of a position specific scoring matrix . <cit> 

in general, mhc class-ii prediction methods are categorized into two main classes  <cit> :  quantitative prediction methods that predict inhibitory concentration  values and  qualitative prediction methods that determine the binding status  based on the predictive score. recent quantitative prediction approaches include svrmhc  <cit> , pls-isc  <cit> , arb  <cit> , and smm-align  <cit> . the arb approach uses full length of the peptide whereas both svrmhc and pls-isc approaches use a preprocessing step involving alignment of sequences, based on anchor position-specific residues. the underlying assumption of smm-align is that amino acids occupying the 9-mer binding core motif are sufficient to determine the affinity of peptide-mhc binding. however, in some cases, the predictive performance could be improved by incorporating terminal residues known as peptide flanking residues   <cit> .

qualitative prediction approaches use classifiers such as artificial neural networks  <cit> , hidden markov models  <cit> , support vector machines  <cit> , and their hybrids  <cit> , or profile analysis such as those using iterative learning  <cit> , stochastic approaches   <cit> , gibbs motif sampler  <cit> , profile motifs   <cit> , dna microarrays and virtual matrices   <cit> , and evolutionary algorithms   <cit> . however, given a set of sequences of differing lengths with known binding affinities, the location of the binding core within each sequence must be first identified before classification of sequences. classical multiple sequence alignment techniques often fail to detect binding cores in mhc class ii binding peptides because of weak instances of binding motifs.

all methods predicting peptides binding to mhc molecules have their pros and cons; most show good performance only for datasets upon which they were developed. therefore, there is a need for new algorithms that perform well on previously unseen data. we propose to use moea to align a set of experimentally determined binding peptides at their binding cores and subsequently derive the consensus motif. the methods are especially useful when molecules are promiscuous and bind to a large number of low affinity peptides. the preliminary results of our work have been presented in  <cit> .

i-ag <dig> is the mhc class ii molecule of the nod mouse, critical for the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus  and other autoimmune disorders  <cit> . knowledge of peptides binding to i-ag <dig> is important in understanding the molecular basis of development of iddm in nod mice. experiments have demonstrated that i-ag <dig> binding peptides are 9–30aa long  <cit> . finding motifs in peptide binding to i-ag <dig> is a non-trivial problem  <cit> . despite numerous attempts, no consensus has been reached on the rules of peptide binding to i-ag <dig> molecule  <cit> . however, computational analyses on multiple datasets indicate that experimental motifs satisfy only a subset of rules describing the optimal motif.

to demonstrate the utility in predicting peptides binding to other mhc molecules, our method is tested on two benchmark datasets comprising of peptides of number of different hla  and mouse alleles. the first dataset, referred to as bm-set <dig> here onwards, consists of different combinations of peptides of hla-drb1* <dig> allele, and the second dataset, bm-set <dig>  consists of datasets from thirteen different hla alleles and three mouse alleles.

multi-objective evolutionary algorithms 
evolutionary algorithms  are based on the principles of biological evolution and have often been successful in solving complex search and optimization problems. majority of bioinformatics applications of ea have been in the discovery of motifs such as transcription factor binding sites  <cit> . yet, only a few researchers have used ea for the prediction of peptides binding to protein sequences  <cit> .

an ea consists of  representing input variables as individuals or chromosomes  in a population,  formulating the fitness  to evaluate individuals,  generating a new population by genetic operations  on the current population, and  determining if the population has reached the optimal fitness. the algorithm begins with an initial population and evolves over time. at a particular instance of evolution, every individual is evaluated by its fitness. new populations  are produced from highly fit individuals  selected, which undergo genetic operations. each offspring is paired and compared to its parents. highly fit individuals are retained in the population while less fit individuals are discarded. search mechanisms such as elitism, constraint-handling, and multi-objective optimization are available for finding a better spread of solutions, depending on the needs of the optimization problem  <cit> .

multi-objective evolutionary algorithms  are used to solve problems which require simultaneous optimization of a number of competing objective functions  <cit> . moea maintains a set of solutions ranked by their dominance at a given instant of the evolution. a solution is said to dominate another if it is better or equal with respect to all objectives and strictly better in at least one objective  <cit> . often, there are more than one non-dominated solutions, representing the best ones, collectively known as the pareto front. moea algorithms result in a pareto optimal set of solutions.

non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii  was recently introduced to incorporate several new genetic mechanisms for better convergence, such as non-dominated sorting, elitism, diversity preservation, and constraint handling  <cit> . in nsga-ii, a population is subjected to several rounds of non-dominated sorting. that is, all the non-dominated individuals are identified and assigned the same fitness value until a new set of non-dominated solutions is found. the solutions found in subsequent rounds are assigned fitness values lower than those in the previous rounds. this process continues until the whole population is partitioned into non-dominated fronts with diverse fitness values. the elitism prevents the loss of fit individuals encountered in earlier generations by allowing earlier solutions to survive in the subsequent generations. the diversity of pareto-optimal solutions is maintained by imposing a measure referred to as crowding distance. a solution that satisfies the constraints defined by the objective functions is called a feasible solution.

peptide binding to mhc class ii i-ag7
in this paper, we attempt to find an optimal motif describing peptide binding to mhc class ii molecules, using experimentally determined binding data. there are several factors that impede the derivation of such a consensus motif. the first is the strong resemblance among the peptides isolated in a single experiment and the second is the diversity among different datasets. a motif derived from a dataset lacking diversity indicates a bias towards the dataset used in deriving the motif. such motifs are difficult to generalize on other experimental or previously unseen datasets. the moea based motif detection algorithm is designed to find a consensus motif on i-ag <dig> datasets, which alleviates the influences arising from biased datasets and thereby predicts binding peptides more accurately in new datasets.

RESULTS
predicting peptides binding to mhc class ii
we use our approach to find a consensus motif on seven experimental datasets of peptides binding to i-ag <dig> molecules, obtained from literature  <cit> . the motif is validated using an independent testing set generated from the stratmann dataset  <cit> . the overall quality of prediction was measured using area under curve  of the receiver operating characteristics  curve  <cit> . auc values of all feasible solutions in the final population of ea were evaluated and the solution with the highest auc was chosen as the consensus motif .

seven-fold cross-validation accuracies of moea derived motifs on training dataset.

to compare the performance of our method with earlier methods, a training dataset was created by combining all the experimental datasets given in table  <dig>  motifs derived on the training dataset were tested on an independent test dataset – a balanced set generated from stratmann dataset. the stratmann dataset was balanced by adding randomly generated non-binders. twenty five such balanced test datasets were assembled by generating random samples starting from different seeds and adding them to the stratmann dataset. the results reported are based on the average auc values over all balanced test sets. figure  <dig> shows comparison of performances of motifs derived by moea and by earlier motif prediction approaches such as meme and rankpep. an increase of 4–10% in predictive performance is observed with moea over the other approaches.

comparison of performances of moea derived motifs for bm-set <dig>  with enhanced gibbs sampler  <cit> , tepitope  <cit> , svrmhc  <cit>  and arb  <cit> , is given in table  <dig>  as seen, moea shows comparable or superior performance with gibbs sampler on all datasets except for the southwood dataset. out of the ten non-redundant  datasets, the moea outperformed gibbs sampler, tepitope, svrmhc and arb by seven, nine, eight and ten datasets, respectively.

the performance of moea on bm-set <dig>  was compared with gibbs sampler  <cit> , tepitope  <cit> , svrmhc  <cit> , arb  <cit>  and netmhcii  <cit> . each allele dataset was subjected to five-fold cross-validation and the results are given in table  <dig>  the present method shows comparable or superior performance on majority of allele datasets compared to gibbs sampler, svrmhc, tepitope, and netmhcii. a fair comparison of arb method cannot be drawn because the method has been trained on quantitative data obtained from iedb  <cit> .

discussion
we proposed two approaches using moea for deriving motifs  when the information of only the binders and non-binders are known  and  when, in addition, the information of experimentally  determined motifs are available .

since i-ag <dig> molecule is known to bind to a large number of peptides of low affinity and appears to be a promiscuous binder, the prediction of peptides binding to i-ag <dig> molecule has been nontrivial. this has lead to the definition of a number of suboptimal consensus motifs specific to the datasets. moea derived motifs had superior generalization capabilities to those derived with meme and rankpep techniques as well as to the experimentally determined motifs on other datasets. the performances evaluated on two benchmark datasets indicate that the present moea based algorithm is applicable in deriving motifs on other class ii mhc alleles as well.

the likelihood of finding an optimal motif by moea is higher than by a local or greedy search because of the stochastic nature of ea. the proposed approach learns from the characteristics of both binders and non-binders in the training set whereas other methods use information only from binders to determine motifs  <cit> . moreover, ranges of the parameters involved in moea are known, so the parameters of the fitness functions are quickly estimated in a few cross-validation runs. furthermore, unlike the earlier methods, the present method does not rely on any prior information such as anchor positions to obtain an alignment, prior distributions, etc.,  <cit> . given sufficient data samples representing both binders and non-binders, the method could be applicable to find motifs in other types of molecules. a future direction of this research would be to integrate additional information such as peptide length  <cit>  and pfr  <cit>  as such information has been shown to have the potential to enhance motif detection  <cit> . this would lead to further improvement of the performance of the present algorithm.

even though eas are generally known to be computationally intensive, training for derivation of scoring matrices can be performed off-line and the prediction engines can be provided through web services. as seen in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  a single method does not always perform well on all types of allele datasets. nevertheless, the present method showed higher accuracy in detecting motifs on majority of mhc alleles in the benchmark datasets. therefore, we believe that moea-based methods could provide a general framework for efficiently determining motifs in a wide range of mhc molecules.

in immunology, accuracy and speed in predicting binding peptides is of paramount importance. computationally predicted binders do subsequently need to be validated with wet-lab experiments. by using computational predictions as an initial step, high cost involved in initial screening and time-consuming clinical testing can be significantly reduced. towards this end, the proposed moea methods present a promising way to predict peptides that bind to mhc class ii alleles including promiscuous and low affinity peptide binders.

CONCLUSIONS
we present two moea-based algorithms for finding motifs, one for self-discovery and the other for guided-discovery by experimentally determined motifs, and thereby predicting binding peptides to i-ag <dig> molecule. our experiments show that the proposed moea-based algorithms are better than earlier methods in predicting binding sites not only on i-ag <dig> but also on most alleles of class ii mhc benchmark datasets. this demonstrates the applicability of our methods to find binding motifs in a wide range of mhc alleles.
