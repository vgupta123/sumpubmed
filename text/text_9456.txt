BACKGROUND
limb development and patterning originate from close interactions between tendon, cartilage and muscle precursor cells. mouse forelimb development is first evident at about embryonic day   <dig> . approximately  <dig> h later myogenic cells are identified at the base of the forelimb and at e <dig>  the first hint of humerus is apparent  <cit> . at e <dig>  a miniature model of the forelimb has been formed. limb muscle precursors migrate from the lateral part of the somites into the limb bud where they undergo final differentiation. among the transcription factors involved in early myogenesis are pax <dig> and lbx <dig> whose expression precedes the expression of myogenic regulatory factors . mrfs belong to the myod family of basic helix-loop-helix factors. in mammals there are four such factors: myf <dig>  myod, myogenin, and mrf <dig>  <cit> . little is known about the mechanisms whereby these genes regulate limb muscle development. the homeobox transcription factor pitx <dig> was originally identified as one of the genes responsible for axenfeld-rieger syndrome, mainly affecting eyes, teeth, and abdominal organs  <cit> . pitx <dig> is expressed in a subset of pax3+ limb muscle precursors already at e <dig> . by e <dig>  pitx <dig> is expressed in all limb musculature and persists until adulthood  <cit> . still, pitx <dig> null mutants form nearly all muscle anlagen even though several of these muscle anlagen are distorted, coupled with malformation of the part of the body to which they attach  <cit> . muscles attach to bone through tendons. limb tendon cells originate from lateral plate mesoderm and tendon progenitor cells are regionalized in the dorsal and ventral areas of the limb where they are mixed with muscle progenitor cells  <cit> . compared to other mesodermal tissues, such as blood vessels, cartilage, bone, and muscles, very little is known about the early formation and role of tendons during development. among the transcription factors identified in developing tendons are scleraxis, eya <dig>  eya <dig>  six <dig>  and six <dig> of which eya <dig>  eya <dig>  six <dig> and six <dig> are also expressed in limb muscle precursors  <cit> . this parallel expression in myoblast precursors of somite origin and in mesenchymal cells derived from the lateral plate may ensure correct and concerted migration of the two cell types  <cit> . to further study the role of pitx <dig> in forelimb development we have generated mice that exhibit a brief pulse of pitx <dig> over-expression in the forelimb mesenchyme from e <dig>  to e <dig> . the expression is driven by mouse keratocan  5'-flanking sequence, which has been used previously to achieve over-expression of pitx <dig> in the cornea  <cit> . the construct was termed ktcn-pitx <dig>  keratocan is one of three major components of the extracellular keratan sulfate proteoglycans present mainly in vertebrate corneal stroma but also expressed in non-ocular tissues such as skeletal muscle and tendon  <cit> . the kera gene is expressed in limbs of mouse embryos at e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> . this is the first report of pitx <dig> over-expression in the forelimb. the ktcn-pitx <dig> mice exhibit pitx <dig> over-expression in the anterior forelimb mesenchyme extending from the humerus to the radius. the cells over-expressing pitx <dig> are of non-myogenic origin and co-express six <dig>  as six <dig> is involved in tendon development, we hypothesize that the observed expression disturbs correct muscle insertion, which in the ktcn-pitx <dig> mouse leads to a random left-right distal misplacement of the biceps brachii insertion. this in turn results in a  <dig> degrees twist of the forelimb musculature. the muscle and tendon anomalies also lead to severe skeletal malformations consisting of a shortened, thickened and malformed humerus, a bowed ulna and a deformed radius. these skeletal malformations have some similarities to the pathogenesis of leri-weill dyschondrosteosis, which is characterized by disproportionate short stature and a characteristic curving of the radius, known as the madelung deformity  <cit> . in conclusion, these findings may increase our understanding about the role of pitx <dig> in limb development and on the interactions between muscle, tendon, and bone during development.

RESULTS
ktcn-pitx <dig> mice have shortened, thickened and malformed humerus, deformed radius and bowed ulna
the ktcn-pitx <dig> forelimb phenotype occurs randomly on either left or right forelimb. occasionally both forelimbs are affected . the bone malformations consist of a shortened, thickened and malformed humerus and a diminished deltoid tuberosity. the humerus malformation is most prominent distally and partly distorts the olecranon fossa. the olecranon fossa is a dorsal depression that receives the olecranon  of the ulna when the forearm is extended. this leads to a slight dislocation of the proximal ulna. radius is bent proximally and approaches the elbow joint from a straight angel . this locks the elbow in a simultaneous pronation-extension and forces the ulna to bend upwards to reach the carpals. the limitations in elbow movement in combination with the  <dig> degrees twist of the paw makes the forelimb insufficient to support on . hindlimbs, in contrast, do not exhibit any phenotype. the ktcn-pitx <dig> mice are fertile and have normal life span.

limb malformations are present in e <dig>  and in newborn ktcn-pitx <dig> mice
to investigate potential embryonic bone and cartilage anomalies we stained forelimbs from e <dig>  and newborn mice with alcian blue and alizarin red. at e <dig>  ktcn-pitx <dig> mice display a diminished deltoid tuberosity and newborn ktcn-pitx <dig> mice also exhibit a distal thickening of the humerus. the thickening tends to partly dislocate the radius anteriorly and also slightly dislocate the proximal part of the ulna in a more lateral-dorsal position, which makes the ulna appear twisted . bone and cartilage zones were carefully examined at high resolution but appeared normal in the ktcn-pitx <dig> forelimbs of all ages .

ktcn-pitx <dig> mice over-express pitx <dig> in the forelimbs
the ktcn-pitx <dig> mouse model was originally made to study the function of the homeobox gene pitx2a in eye development and its role in the pathology of axenfeld-rieger syndrome and glaucoma  <cit> . the ktcn-pitx <dig> mice over-express human pitx2a in the cornea and iris under the kera promoter and upstream regulatory elements, but kera is also expressed throughout the limbs of embryos from e <dig>  to e <dig>   <cit> . to study whether the ktcn-pitx <dig> mice express human pitx <dig> mrna in the forelimbs at the same embryonic stages as kera is expressed we isolated forelimb rna from ktcn-pitx <dig> embryos  and performed semi-quantitative rt-pcr. human pitx2a mrna expression level peaked at e <dig>  and e <dig>  and declined thereafter, consistent with the expression pattern of kera . further, we used immunohistochemistry to study the expression pattern of pitx <dig> protein in the forelimbs at e <dig> . in wild type embryos pitx <dig> expression is restricted to well defined anterior and posterior muscle groups consistent with previous observations   <cit> . in the ktcn-pitx <dig> forelimbs we observed a proximal anterior over-expression of pitx <dig> in the mesenchyme close to the humerus but also an anterior over-expression in the mesenchyme expanding from the elbow joint to the distal part of radius. these areas did not stain for muscle specific antibodies against pax <dig>  myod <dig>  myogenin, or myosin . this could either be due to that the cells over-expressing pitx <dig> are not of myogenic origin, or muscle markers are down regulated as a result of the over-expression. in vitro studies have shown that pitx2c over-expression promotes cell proliferation and arrests differentiation in myoblasts  <cit> . however, in the forelimbs of adult ktcn-pitx <dig> mice, all muscle groups are present, indicating that the cells over-expressing pitx <dig> are of non-myogenic origin. in the ktcn-pitx <dig> mice, we consistently observed pitx <dig> over-expression in both right and left forelimbs . it has been reported that pitx <dig> regulates the expression of cyclin d <dig>  after wnt induction in c2c <dig> myoblasts  <cit> . we did not detect any increased expression of ccnd <dig> in the cells over-expressing pitx <dig> or any increased apoptotic activity . notably, the region of over-expression is situated close to where the first phenotypes later appear.

the biceps brachii of ktcn-pitx <dig> mice has a misplaced insertion
to gain a deeper understanding of the forelimb phenotype we dissected forelimbs from adult ktcn-pitx <dig> mice. despite the obvious twist of the musculature, all muscle groups are present and originate and insert correctly except for biceps brachii. biceps brachii is a flexor muscle whose function is to decrease the joint angle at the elbow but also to supinate  the forearm at the radioulnar joints. it originates at two separate sites in the scapula and inserts at the proximal part of the radius. in the ktcn-pitx <dig> mice biceps brachii insertion is altered as its distal tendon is curled around the radius and inserts dorsally at the very most distal part of the bone . this would explain the limited elbow motion but also the permanent pronation of the ktcn-pitx <dig> forelimbs. muscle groups work as antagonists. if the supination movement is impaired its antagonist, the pronator, will dominate, which may result in the pronation position.

pitx <dig> and six <dig> are co-expressed in non-myogenic cells in the ktcn-pitx <dig> forelimbs
to study the molecular mechanism behind the ktcn-pitx <dig> forelimb tendon anomalies and to further characterize the identity of the cells over-expressing pitx <dig>  we analyzed the expression of six <dig> in wild type and ktcn-pitx <dig> forelimbs. at e <dig>  both pitx <dig> and six <dig> are expressed in the developing forelimb musculature , but in the ktcn-pitx <dig> embryos, six <dig> is also expressed in a limited area within the non-myogenic cells over-expressing pitx <dig> . this co-expression is more evident  <dig> h later. at e <dig>  six <dig> expression overlaps a substantial area of the cells over-expressing pitx <dig> . this suggests a relationship between pitx <dig> and six <dig> and indicates that at least part of the cells over-expressing pitx <dig> are involved in tendinous patterning. in addition, studies performed in silico show several potential bicoid/pitx <dig> binding sites in the six <dig> promoter .

discussion
pitx <dig> acts in hindlimb development together with pitx <dig> where the former specifies laterality and the latter determines hindlimb identity  <cit> . during forelimb development pitx <dig> is expressed in almost all muscle anlagen from embryogenesis until adulthood  <cit> . we show here for the first time that over-expression of pitx <dig> in non-myogenic cells of the developing forelimb results in a distal misplacement of the biceps brachii insertion, which gives rise to severe bone malformations, randomly affecting left or right forelimb. the bone anomalies include a diminished deltoid tuberosity, a shortened, thickened and malformed humerus. in addition, it causes the radius to approach the elbow via a perpendicular bend, which in turn limits the elbow movement, and forces a dorsally dislocated ulna to curve over radius to reach the carpals. the phenotype worsens two to three weeks after birth, possibly due to the increased load on the forelimbs as the mouse starts to walk. on the other hand we frequently detected mice with both forelimbs affected from early on. also, mice with only one affected leg never developed any phenotype on the supporting leg. the skeletal malformations have some similarities to the pathogenesis of leri-weill dyschondrosteosis, characterized by disproportionate short stature, curving of the radius, and subluxation of the distal end of the ulna. mutations in the shox gene have been shown to cause the disorder. however, for 27% of the cases, no causative gene has been identified  <cit> . pitx <dig> is expressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm and acts as an effector for left-right asymmetry in mesoderm derived organs such as lungs  <cit> . also, pitx1-/- embryos show left-right asymmetry in the severity of a hindlimb phenotype due to redundancy between pitx <dig> and pitx <dig>  <cit> . still, the limbs are symmetrical. it has previously been shown that function of pitx <dig> is dosage-sensitive  <cit> . hence, the more plausible explanation for the random left-right forelimb anomalies of the ktcn-pitx <dig> mice could be minor differences in pitx <dig> expression levels between left and right. pitx <dig> expression in limbs is restricted to muscle lineages and it has recently been shown that pitx <dig> is one of the most complete muscle markers  <cit> . immunohistochemistry on wild type forelimb sections demonstrate co-expression of pitx <dig> and other muscle markers such as myod, myogenin, and myosin. in contrast, the cells over-expressing pitx <dig> in the ktcn-pitx <dig> forelimbs do not express any of these muscle markers. based on the observed tendon anomalies in the ktcn-pitx <dig> forelimbs we stained for six <dig>  normally expressed in developing tendons. co-expression of pitx <dig> and six <dig> could indicate that the cells over-expressing pitx <dig> are involved in tendon development and positioning. the factors regulating correct attachments of tendons to bone and the time of commitment of tendon precursors to a tendon cell fate in vertebrates are largely unknown  <cit> . however, reports have shown that myotubes can induce tendon primordial into individual tendons and, moreover, if tendon precursors are removed, myotubes attach ectopically  <cit> . it is possible that the observed expression of six <dig> in the cells over-expressing pitx <dig> interferes with the signals coordinating correct tendon insertion. based on the observed co-expression of pitx <dig> and six <dig> in our mouse model it is intriguing to note that both transcription factors are expressed during other developmental processes. neural crest cells that migrate to the periocular mesenchyme during eye development express both pitx <dig> and six <dig>  <cit> . in addition, eya <dig>  another limb tendon marker, is expressed in developing anterior chamber structures of the eye including the iris, ciliary structures, and cornea, tissues that also express pitx <dig>  <cit> . it would be interesting to further study a possible relation between pitx <dig>  six <dig>  and eya <dig>  notably, pitx <dig> is closely related to pitx <dig> and normally involved in and restricted to hindlimb development. when ectopically expressed in the forelimbs it induces transformation and translocation of specific muscles, tendons, and bones of the forelimb  <cit> . finally, the temporal overlap of muscle and tendon formation with the over-expression of pitx <dig> makes the ktcn-pitx <dig> mouse an appropriate animal model to study the development of the musculoskeletal system.

CONCLUSIONS
over-expression of pitx <dig> during mouse forelimb development results in severe tendon, muscle, and bone anomalies. these observations further support a role of pitx <dig> in forelimb development. this animal model may also be valuable for future studies on the interaction between the skeletal elements and muscles of the limb during embryogenesis and it could provide information on new regulatory pathways involving pitx <dig>
