BACKGROUND
dna sequencing, genomic and post-genomic techniques have made available long lists of partially described sequences and impose the construction of databases essential for mining very large data sets  <cit> . whenever complete transcript sequences and gene structure information are not available, misidentification and erroneous annotation can easily occur. in fact, the greatest challenge in biology today is the precise delineation of genes and protein networks able to explain physiological and pathological phenotypes  <cit> .

besides well known model organisms, a number of invertebrate species differing in life cycles and adaptive strategies support the current understanding of the innate immunity, especially those living in fluctuating marine systems  <cit> . filter-feeder bivalves such as mussels, oysters and clams typically harbour a community of commensal, opportunistic and pathogenic organisms composed of endoparasites such as mytilicola and urastoma, protozoans such as bonamia, haplosporidium marteilia, perkinsus spp., bacteria of the genus nocardia and vibrio, herpes and enteric viruses. microbial species take part in the biogeochemical cycles and some of them are expected to play a probiotic role in their typical hosts. the common rod-shaped vibrios  well exemplify associations ranging from mutualistic to pathogenic in aquatic animals  <cit> . v. cholerae, v. parahaemolyticus, v. vulnificus and other nine vibrio species cause mild or severe syndromes in humans while other halophilic vibrios occurring in brackish and marine habitats can greatly affect molluscs, crustaceans and fish . often triggered by environmental factors such as temperature, salinity or pollutants, elements of such microbiota may invade and colonize the host and eventually lead to disease outbreaks and mortality, especially in larvae, spat and juveniles of natural and farmed bivalves  <cit> . compared to oyster and clams, no apparent mortality and fewer pathologies have been reported in mussels  <cit> . it is more likely that mytilus spp. are a reservoir of infective agents for aquatic organisms and humans, since, for instance, they tolerate significant amounts of v. alginolyticus, v. parahemolyticus and other vibrios  <cit> . in fact, comparative and advanced understanding of the early-induced host responses may sustain and improve the aquaculture production in many coastal regions worldwide  <cit> .

immunocompetent mollusc cells, at least the circulating hemocytes, and a variety of molecular effectors provide a rapid and robust line of defence against potential pathogens. once activated by the interaction between pathogen associated molecular patterns  and pathogen recognition receptors , such cells display chemotactic and chemokinetic reactions, participate in encapsulation and melanization, carry out phagocytic or lytic killing. these events are made possible by the concerted action of transmembrane and soluble lectins, toll-like and virus sensing receptors, hydrolytic enzymes and proteolytic reaction cascades, short-lived cytotoxic by-products and antimicrobial peptides   <cit> . according to morphological observations and flow cytometry, bivalve hemocytes are heterogeneous and very dynamic cells of 7- <dig> Î¼m size which can be classified into large granulocytes  most active in phagocytosis and ros production, large hyalinocytes with intermediate activity, small non-phagocytic semigranular cells  and the less abundant blast-like hyalinocytes  <cit> . as mytilus hemocytes respond to interleukin  <dig> , tumour necrosis factor  and to opioid peptides  they may be part of an ancient monokine-like network  <cit> . also relevant to the use of mussels as biosensors of coastal pollution  <cit>  the interdependence of cell processes modulated by chemical contaminants and infective agents requires additional study  <cit> .

the sequence data available for bivalve species are slowly but steadily growing, especially through est collections  <cit> . a set of  <dig>  cdna probes of m. galloprovincialis was arranged to investigate the transcriptional signatures of pollutants  <cit>  but more work has subsequently been devoted to est sequencing, also using technologies which provide very large amounts of short reads more difficult to annotate  <cit> . a double set of 5' and 3' ests of m. californianus,  <dig>  in total, was used to investigate the influence of the tidal cycle on mussel physiology  <cit> . as a result of laboratory treatments performed with environmental pollutants, bacterial antigens and viral-like polynucleotides,  <dig>  high-quality ests of m. galloprovincialis are now organized in a structured collection of  <dig>  transcript sequences  <cit> , named mytibase and including most of the ests publicly available for the mediterranean mussel .

in the absence of genomic information, this knowledge base offered us the unique opportunity to outline the available mussel immunome and develop a new microarray platform. in the following sections we present the most relevant mytibase clusters and singletons related to mussel immunity and the validation of a species-specific immunochip with hemocyte samples of vibrio-injected mussels.

RESULTS
identification of immune-related mytibase sequences
the mytibase descriptions report blast similarity searches, structured gene ontology vocabulary  and identifiable protein features of the interpro database   <cit> . the latter, in particular, supported the characterization of unknown or poorly predicted sequences, and integrated the meaning of a substantial fraction of the mussel transcripts.

not surprisingly, the mytibase sequences  are often defined by multiple iprs with the notable exception of  <dig> ests codifying the mussel amp that could only be recognized by similarity to prototype sequences of mytilin, myticin, mytimycin and defensin. table  <dig> illustrates in decreasing order of abundance the first  <dig> of  <dig> redundant iprs present in the mgcs and the known mussel amp. the protein motifs represented in mytibase point to cell processes which are not restricted to the immune system as only 15% of the total iprs directly refer to immunity. nevertheless, the abundance of transcripts identifying amp precursors or including domains such as complement c1q  and the related tumour necrosis factor-like , c-type lectin  and fibrinogen, alpha/beta/gamma chain, c-terminal globular subdomain  definitely confirm that the mytibase est collection is particularly rich in immuno-related transcripts. conversely, about 41% of the listed iprs are exclusive of single clusters and singletons, with uncommon and intriguing protein motifs exemplified by ipr <dig>  and ipr <dig> . the iprs mentioned are easily found in mytibase as interpro key words.

*, **: the paired cases examplify domains with overlapping architecture. see more on the protein signatures at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro.

since the genome of m. galloprovincialis is not available and sequence data are still limited, we applied a multiple search strategy to identify in mytibase a relevant set of immune-related sequences. a low-stringency tblastn search allowed the extraction of  <dig> mussel sequences related to immune system processes  and  <dig>  sequences similar to those indexed in the multispecies catalogue immunomebase . searches based on key words and manual screening yielded an additional  <dig> inputs and supported the final selection of  <dig> mussel sequences, which can be regarded as an operational set and the starting point for the progressive authentication of immune-related candidates by transcriptional analyses and gene studies. additional file  <dig> describes the selected mgcs and updates their functional annotation whereas the following paragraphs illustrate by abundance and putative function the most relevant ones to the mussel immunity.

transcripts identifying antimicrobial peptides
almost ubiquitous in the living species but highly diverse in structure and biological activity, host defence peptides interact with negatively charged cell membranes, lead to microbe killing and modulate both the innate and inducible antimicrobial responses in mammals  <cit> . four groups of amp are known in mussels: defensins, mytilins myticins and mytimycins  <cit> . the cationic and amphipatic structure of the mature peptides is stabilized by  <dig> intrachain disulphide bonds  according to a unifying tridimensional motif  <cit> . mytibase includes the full length precursor sequences of all the mussel amp with some new variants: they are reported as mature peptide sequences in figure  <dig> 

myticins are subdivided in a, b  and the polymorphic type c   <cit> . searching tblastn similarities to prototype sequences, we identified in mytibase many precursors of myticin c , myticin a  and myticin b . robust non-synonymous snps analysis allowed us to split the sequence cluster of myticin a into  <dig> subgroups named a, a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  confirmed by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequence traces of high-quality, respectively .

mytilin precursors are more heterogeneous in length ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> residues, and can be easily differentiated from the myticin precursors due to a different cysteine pattern. similarly, we identified mytilin a , mytilin b , mytilin c , mytilin d . we could also extend the sequence of mytilin g <dig>   <cit>  and we propose mgc <dig>  as mytilin f, namely a new mytilin component.

the defensin precursors identified in mytibase are mgd <dig> , mgd2b  and three new sequences proposed as mgd <dig>  mgd <dig>  and mgd <dig>  due to the presence of a stop codon just after the 8th conserved cystein, defensins mgd <dig> and mgd <dig> are shorter than the others whereas mgd <dig> is the longest with  <dig> aminoacid residues.

only one mytibase est  corresponds to the mytimycin described in m. edulis  and four other sequences grouped from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ests may be regarded as new mytimycin variants. curiously, two of these ests  display a long insertion in the 5' utr and a signal peptide with maximal cleavage probabilities between positions 18- <dig> from atg. cdnas normalization was essential to reveal the rare mytimycin ests whereas the other more abundant amp sequences can be easily and mainly attributed to hemocyte libraries prepared from immunostimulated italian and spanish mussels, without evidence of preferential geographical distribution . all mussel amp  and one hydramacin-like transcript  have been included in the immunochip.

transcripts containing c1q and tumour necrosis factor-like domains
the overlapping c1q  and tnf-like  domains have probably evolved by divergence from an ancient recognition molecule whose diversification could have started with urochordates and cephalocordates  <cit> . the large family of proteins with a c1q domain support many biological processes, from complement activation, modulatory immune functions, apoptotic cell clearance to coagulation, embryonic development and tissue homeostasis  <cit> .

in mammals, the  <dig> polypeptide chains composing the complement subcomponent c1q are characterized by a short n-terminal region, a collagen-like gly/pro-rich tract and a c-terminal tulip-like structure of globular c1q domains  also found in ficolins and other proteins. the c1q binding to immunoglobulins within immunocomplexes initiates the classic complement cascade and pathogen elimination. in the presence of ca ions, the interaction of self and non-self ligands with charged gc1q residues causes gc1q reorientation and bending of the collagenous region. the activation signal is then transmitted to serine protease precursors  which, in turn, promote the proteolytic complement cascade and formation of a membrane attack complex  <cit> . overall, the modularity and versatility of pattern recognition confirm the essential role of gc1q in both innate and acquired immune responses.

several mgcs display sequence similarity to c1q, tnf, precerebellin, collagen and emilin proteins. searching the tnf-like domain ipr <dig> in mytibase, we identified  <dig> transcripts, most of which are also characterized by the c1q domain ipr <dig>  hidden markov model analysis allowed the recognition of  <dig> additional c1q-containing sequences and the c1q motif was confirmed by manual validation in all  <dig> cases, without evidence of a true tnf domain. to illustrate their molecular diversity, a selection of the most divergent c1q-containing mgcs is reported in figure  <dig>  many of them are similar to a sequence highly expressed in the mantle of the oyster pinctada fucata  <cit>  and some are very abundant, for instance mgc <dig> with  <dig> out of  <dig> ests originating from hemocyte cdnas  <cit> . in addition to the c-terminal globular domain, most of the predicted c1q proteins of m. galloprovincialis  have a short n-terminal signal peptide but lack central collagen-like repeats; hence, they should represent secreted gc1q receptor proteins expected to elicit chemotaxis and pathogen lysis via more ancient complement pathways  <cit> . the abundance and molecular diversity of the c1q-containing transcripts of m. galloprovincialis suggest pathogen-induced expansion of lectin-like prr: the identification of related gene sequences will allow a comparison with the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> c1q gene models reported in homo sapiens, danio rerio and in the amphioxus brachiostoma floridae, respectively  <cit> . the new microarray platform includes  <dig> of these mussel transcripts and also a few mussel transcripts similar to the complement component c <dig>  and a membrane attack complex/perforin/c <dig>  expected to be involved in the pathogen lysis.

additional lectin-like and receptor-related transcripts
protein-carbohydrate recognition is crucial to many cell processes and host-pathogen interactions. lectins are membrane-associated and soluble proteins with specific carbohydrate recognition domains  which can either facilitate mutualistic interactions between host and microbiota or initiate innate and adaptive immune responses  <cit> . acting as recognition receptors, lectins promote opsonization, phagocytosis and the activation of the complement system  <cit> . structural and functional features distinguish eight to fifteen lectin groups largely related to immunity: c-type, s-type or glycan-binding galectins, i-type specific to sialic acids and glycoseaminoglycans also containing an ig-like fold, pentraxins, fucolectins, fibrinogen-like lectins, ficolins, tachylectins and slug agglutinin, chitinase-like lectins, and orphan lectins. transmembrane calnexins and soluble calreticulins support trafficking, sorting and maturation of glycoproteins whereas lectins localized in the plasma membrane or released into the extracellular matrix and body fluids mediate a broad range of processes including cell adhesion, cell signalling, pathogen recognition and endocytosis. compared to more ancient lectins acting in the quality control of glycoproteins, extracellular lectins such as ficolins have evolved independently in the vertebrate and invertebrate lineages. the evolutionary radiation of these molecules emphasises the importance of the glycan code and lectin-ligand interactions in the immune responses and apoptotic cell clearance  <cit> .

each ipr can be referred to upstream- and downstream-related protein domains .

the second abundant lectin-like group recalls fibrinogen and fibronectin proteins and ficolins. like the crd of the mannose-binding lectins, the c-terminal fibrinogen-like domain  of ficolins has a bouquet-like structure which binds the carbohydrate residues of foreign and apoptotic cells  or in association with specific serine proteases  initiates the proteolytic complement cascade and pathogen lysis  <cit> . species-specific expansion of fibrinogen-related proteins  has been reported in the snail biomphalaria glabrata and the mosquito anopheles gambiae  <cit> . in the crayfish pacifastacus leniusculus, a protein containing the fibrinogen-like domain, but devoid of the hemagglutinating activity typical of vertebrate ficolins, acts as negative regulator of the prophenoloxidase system  and interferes with the transformation of quinone compounds to melanin  <cit> .

other mgcs point to galectins , i-type lectins  able to bind carbohydrate ligands via immunoglobulin-like domains, gh <dig> chitinase enzymes , l-type lectins  entailed in the intracellular protein sorting and p-type lectins , transmembrane proteins involved in the transport of lysosomal enzymes from the golgi complex and the cell surface to lysosomes. for instance, chitinases are glycosyl hydrolases widely expressed from cnidarians to mammals, able to degrade the polysaccharide Î²--poly-n-acetyl d-glucosamine and confer protection against chitin-containing pathogens and parasites  <cit> .

mytibase is also rich in sequences with wd- <dig> repeats  and leucin rich repeats . the modular organization of wd and lrr domains of vertebrate proteins sustains the diversity and plasticity of the apoptosome and inflammasome complexes in response to microbial products and metabolic stress, with the latter commonly signalled by ros, nucleic acids, cathepsin and other molecules released by damaged cells  <cit> . in detail, the ligand binding to the carboxy-terminal lrr region of cytosolic receptors of the nod-like family  can trigger receptor clustering, recruitment and activation of initiating caspases, release of il-1r and il <dig> citokines, inflammation and inflammatory cell death .

although many mgcs refer to nucleic acid binding proteins  or rna/dna binding helicases , further study is necessary to assign them an antiviral function typical of intracellular nod-like and rig-like helicase receptors or some membrane-bound tlrs  <cit> . with the possible exception of mgc <dig>  a piwi-like singleton suggestive of silencing and regulative events in germ cells and hematopoietic stem cells, and putative rna helicases of the dead-box family , we could not identify in mytibase the core sirna machinary dcr- <dig>  r2d <dig>  ago <dig> responsible for antiviral responses in drosophila  <cit> .

keeping in mind the  <dig> and  <dig> tlr gene models identified in the genome of strongylocentrotus purpuratus and branchiostoma floridae  <cit> , respectively, the occasional presence in mytibase of tlr-related sequences  is disappointing. in fact, only mgc <dig>  mgc <dig>  mgc <dig> and few other lrr-containing sequences display fragmentary similarity to human, fish and invertebrate tlr proteins. in the human tlrs, extracellular lrrs are arranged to recognize specific pamps whereas the intracellular toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  domain activates downstream signalling pathways. according to a recent comparative overview, the identification of authentic invertebrate tlrs cannot rely on the sequence homology and requires functional studies  <cit> .

present in mytibase are also putative ig-like and mhc-related surface antigens , sequences with a thyroglobulin domain  typical of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins and hla class ii invariant chain, and g-protein-coupled receptors  involved in the transduction of various signals and accounting for about 3% of human genes  <cit> .

other mgcs are similar to von willebrand factor type c  found in plasma proteins promoting adhesion and thrombus formation at injured sites, fasciclin-like proteins , toll-interleukin receptor , speract/scavenger receptor , receptor-binding alpha macroglobulins , mannose-6-phosphate receptor  and tnf receptors .

transcripts involved in signalling and regulative networks
not restricted to the innate immunity, cell signalling against fungal, bacterial and viral antigens occurs in insects through the toll, imd, jak-stat and p13k/akt/tor pathways. the first two are similar to the vertebrate tlr/il and tnf signalling pathways, and interact with distinct nfkb factors to induce the expression of amp and other molecules, whereas the inhibition of the nutrient signalling p13k/akt/tor can restrict viral replication by cell autophagy and reallocation of the resources from growth to immune defences  <cit> .

related to toll/il and tnf signalling are mgcs putatively identifying the lps-induced tnf alpha factor or litaf , tnf receptor associated factor traf , the adapter molecule myd <dig> , pellino which is known to associate with the kinase domain of the pelle ser/thr kinase , nf_kb_inhibitor cactus , a nfkb inhibitor-interacting ras-like protein  and the transcription factor nfkb/rel/dorsal .

definitely, many mgcs include the ankyrin repeat  typical of regulatory proteins but insufficient in itself to provide function recognition. conversely, putative mussel kinases and phosphatases  support the existence of the mitogen-activated protein kinase  signalling, whereas the ef-hand signature  and putative small g proteins  denote calcium regulated pathways. putative zinc finger proteins , transcription factors bzip-like , lim-type , jun-like , p53/runt-type  and repressors of transcription  reinforce the idea of multiple signalling pathways in mussels.

interactions between protein kinase c, fak and src protein tyrosine kinases occur during the integrin-mediated spreading of lymnaea stagnalis haemocytes  <cit>  and robust intracellular signalling is essential to cytoskeleton remodelling, cell adhesion and migration of pamp-activated haemocytes  <cit> . although more than  <dig> mgcs contain a dna-binding domain and some of them include the sh <dig> domain , there is no proof in mytibase of a mussel jak/stat pathway, the main signalling system for a wide array of mammalian cytokines and growth factors. nevertheless, the remarkable presence of a mussel macrophage migration inhibitory factor , transcripts recalling platelet-derived growth factor , interferon-induced proteins , an interleukin enhancer binding factor , an interleukin-1-receptor-associated kinase  and g-protein coupled chemokine-like receptors, altogether evoke a regulatory humoral network able to reinforce mussel immunity. unquestionably, mytibase does not contain an il <dig> homologue, found instead expressed in oyster hemocytes following bacterial stimulation  <cit> .

finally, mgcs denoting histone proteins , deacetylase  and acetyltransferase  enzymes confirm the importance of chromatin remodelling and histone modifications in the regulated transcription of effector genes.

transcripts related to oxidative stress and chaperon proteins
scavenging and enzymatic activities protect the living cells from various stress factors, from endogenous reactive oxygen species  produced for instance by the mitochondrial respiratory chain to the oxidative burst consequent to pathogen recognition at the cell surface  <cit> . partial or complete coding sequences of m. galloprovincialis super oxide dismutase , catalase, glutathione transferase, peroxisomal thiolase and polyamine oxidase have been reported  <cit> . in mytibase, numerous mgcs putatively identify enzymes such as amine oxidases, dehydrogenases, peroxidases, mitochondrial oxidases and reductases. in addition to sod  and glutathione peroxidases  many mussel sequences are featured by the thioredoxin fold/domain , typical of proteins regulating the redox state of cellular thiol groups such as the thioredoxin-like reductases .

interestingly, more than  <dig> mgcs indicate heat shock proteins of different sizes  and related binding factors , mostly known to be modulated following immunostimulation  <cit> .

transcripts identifying proteases, protease inhibitors and proteasome components
proteases of various subfamilies and related inhibitors are essential in organism growth and development. proteolytic reactions typically occur in the complement, coagulation and propo cascades, during apoptotic cell death, antimicrobial peptide synthesis and degradation of pathogen components within the lysosomal, cytosolic and extracellular compartments.

for instance, the insect clip-domain sp can act as cofactor or negatively regulate the melanization response, with a repertoire of  <dig> and  <dig> genes in drosophila melanogaster and aedes aegypti, respectively  <cit> . cleavage of viral and host factors operated by granule-associated sp  slows down viral replication and induces the apoptotic elimination of infected mammalian cells  <cit> . caspases of the cysteine protease family also act in the proteolytic cascade of the apoptosis and, via nfkb signalling, regulate inflammatory responses in drosophila  <cit> .

specific enzyme inhibitors are expected to modulate the same biological processes but also inhibit pathogen growth and invasive behaviour. in fact, trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitor levels correlate with the plant resistance to pathogens, and in the basal metazoan hydra magnipapillata the bactericidal activity of a kazal-type sp inhibitor possibly compensates the absence of migratory phagocytic cells  <cit> .

in mytibase, as much as  <dig> and  <dig> domains denote proteases/proteinases/peptidases and their inhibitors, respectively. many mgcs indicate inherently secreted serine-type endopeptidases of the chymotrypsin/hap family , sp inhibitors with kazal-like repeats  or bir repeats , with the latter belonging to the inhibitor of apoptosis  family  <cit> . other mgcs point to cysteine caspase-like peptidases , astacin-like zinc metallopeptidases  and related inhibitors .

more than  <dig> mgcs denote ubiquitin, ubiquitin-related and proteasome-related components and give emphasis to intracellular processes oriented towards the pathogen elimination  <cit> .

transcripts identifying lysozyme
recognized in  <dig> as an antibacterial molecule and abundant in various animal secretions, lyzozyme hydrolyzes  <dig> -beta-linkages in peptidoglycan and chitodextrin structures. in flies and other invertebrates, lysozyme expression and activity increase after exposure to bacteria, and the species-specific gene number partly depends on the use of bacteria as food resource  <cit> . up-regulation of the mussel lysozyme, with increased percentage of hemocytes expressing lysozyme mrna, was observed at 2- <dig> days post-injection of vibrio anguillarum or micrococcus lysodeikticus  <cit>  whereas maximum expression occurred after  <dig> hours in hemocytes immunostimulated in vitro  <cit> . in mytibase, the  <dig> mgcs denoting lysozymes can mainly be classified in types c and g: among them, mgc <dig> is similar to a c-type lysozyme described in insects but not yet reported in molluscs.

definition and validation of a m. galloprovincialis immunochip
owing to the continuous growth of the genbank/uniprotkb/swissprot databases, recurrent similarity searches and manual validation of the emerging similarities guided the progressive selection of  <dig>  mgcs to be confirmed as components of the mussel immunome. probes of 54- <dig> nucleotide length  have been designed using the 3' end transcript region templates and spotted in four replicates to prepare a new dna microarray platform, namely a m. galloprovincialis immunochip.

taking advantage of a large immunostimulation trial conducted in vivo on mussels from three different european regions  <cit>  we selected and processed hemolymph samples collected at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after the injection of  <dig> million exponentially growing vibrio splendidus cells into the adductor muscle. total rna was purified from two hemolymph pools  per time point, and from paired saline-injected control mussels sampled at  <dig> and  <dig> h . as the amplified cy3/cy5-labeled targets were competitively dye-swap tested on the mussel immunochip, the reciprocal hybridizations of a target pair on quadruplicated probes yielded  <dig> fluorescence signals per probe .

looking at the total hybridization data set,  <dig> % of the mussel probes gave significant fluorescence  with a range of  <dig> - <dig> % per individual array and average values of  <dig> % and  <dig> % lighted spots at  <dig> and  <dig> hours, respectively. these percentages reasonably relate to the number of differentially expressed genes  estimated by permutation from the absolute level and standard deviation of the replicates . soon after the immune stimulation, the over-expressed genes are consistently more numerous than the under-expressed , whereas later in time their proportion roughly equals . converting the log <dig>  values by the relative fold change of expression, they range over two orders of magnitudes from + <dig>  to - <dig>   and from +  <dig>  to - <dig>  .

false discovery rate  and delta value are also indicated .

hierarchical clustering of the immunochip profiles clearly shows the resemblance between biological replicates , greater differences between the time points of  <dig> h and  <dig> h, and interesting discriminant signals such as those related to litaf and iap-like apoptosis inhibitors . the general amp down-regulation detected in the hemocytes of vibrio-injected mussels  confirms previous qpcr data  <cit> . similarly, putative acute phase response proteins  and the macrophage migration inhibitory factor  were under-expressed. conversely, probes pointing to allograft inflammatory factor  <dig>  sod, small hsp <dig>  plasminogen as well as various recognition receptors and molecules supporting intracellular signalling  or cytoskeleton remodelling/motility  were commonly up-regulated . compared to the early response, after  <dig> days we detected a significant expression of proteases and protease inhibitors, litaf  and sequences suggesting various cell functions .

in general, no consistent trends could be defined for the c1q-like and lectin-like molecules. due to their abundance and high sequence diversity, further study is necessary to understand their constitutive and pamp-induced expression in mussel hemocytes.

based on the immunochip hybridization data, the molecular pathways and gene functions mapping out the mussel hemocyte response to the vibrio injection are modelled in figure  <dig>  functionally similar to dendritic cells or macrophages, the mussel hemocytes display a pleiotropic response to the bacterial attack. interacting with bacterial pamps, versatile and redundant recognition receptors undergo conformational changes, oligomerization or clustering. the subsequent activation of cross-talking signal transduction pathways adjusts the biochemical cell machinery towards the expression of specific gene sets and key effector molecules . pathogen-induced oxidative burst and damage-associated molecular patterns  also sustain the inflammasome activation and intracellular signalling. eventually, the endolysosomal and proteasome systems, secretory pathways and whole cell behaviour are recruited to achieve the pathogen killing.

overview of the mussel response to live vibrio splendidus
the most ancient defences of the living organisms are based on neuropeptide and protein hormone receptors, receptor kinases and prr  able to signal the danger and increase the expression of various inflammatory and effector molecules  <cit> . in view of the most recently sequenced invertebrate genomes, the pleiotropic innate immune responses could be described as a coordinated system of elements rapidly evolving and expanding the ability for pathogen sensing/targeting, and evolutionary conserved regulatory factors which finely adjust basic cell processes and direct the development and performance of the immune cells  <cit> .

ancient signalling pathways like those of mapks and nfkb are not exclusive of the immune responses and, not solved by standard sequence searching, the identification of invertebrate interleukine homologues  makes new exploratory approaches necessary  <cit> .

although the hemolymph cells are fundamental in the mussel immunity, it is not clear if cells other than hemocytes contribute to the complex spectrum of rapid innate responses to potential pathogens. consistent with a more general view linking immunity to metabolism and other body processes, typical immune genes and proteins should also be expressed in 'non-immune' cells, tissues and organs  <cit> . for instance, the expression of c1q/tnf-like molecules  has been detected in various tissues, with hemocytes showing the greatest levels, and throughout the development of m. galloprovincialis  <cit> .

similar to cells of the vertebrate monocyte/macrophage lineage, pamp-activated immunocytes achieve pathogen elimination essentially through chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and cytotoxic processes  <cit> . in the mediterranean mussel, agranular hemocytes are cells able to divide as they show replication-dependent chromosomal damage  <cit>  whereas the heterogeneous and abundant granulocytes can be regarded as differentiated cells, mostly phagocytic and able to release antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . accordingly, distinct hemocyte subpopulations appear to respond to potential pathogens with specific patterns of gene expression  <cit> .

in addition to the host response, pathogen-related and physico-chemical factors are other main determinants of disease onset and mortality in aquacultured bivalves. the survival and niche occupation of vibrio cells in changeable habitats  depend on the overall nutritional versatility of these bacteria, chemico-physical conditions for growth but also on the expression of hemagglutinins or lectins mediating the interaction with host cells and active secretions able to inhibit or disrupt the host defence reactions such as proteases, pore-forming hemolysins, ciliostatic and hemocyte-killer toxins  <cit> . as suggested for v. harvey, the modulation of signalling pathways essential to the antimicrobial immune response is an additional way to attack and escape the host response  <cit> .

testing the immunochip performance with hemocytes sampled at  <dig> and  <dig> h from vibrio-injected mussels revealed a general amp downregulation, possibly related to the toxicity of live bacteria and contrasting the enhanced response to the stimulus obtained with heat-killed bacteria  <cit> . according to quantitative real time pcr assays performed on the hemolymph cells, the injection of control mussels with saline solution did not affect the expression of immune-relevant genes, namely mytilin b, myticin b, defensin, lysozyme and hsp <dig>  <cit> . the increase in transcriptional changes from  <dig> to  <dig> h and the slight prevalence of down-regulation signals at  <dig> h in the hemocytes of mussels injected with  <dig> million potentially infective v.splendidus cells mark an incoming functional decline. indeed, a not negligible fraction of the vibrio-injected mussels  showed very slow or unapparent reactivity at  <dig> h  whereas no mortality was observed at  <dig> h or in the control mussels injected with the saline solution only. as spanish and french mussels injected in parallel with equal doses of live vibrio cells in their respective locations did not show signs of distress  <cit>  we suppose that season-related life history factors may underlie the overall reaction of these mussels to the injected bacteria. the delayed  over-expression of a number of proteases and stress proteins supports the functional hypothesis. timing and complexity of the mussel immune response as well as the immunostimulation protocol  could also explain the progressive amp down-regulation observed in the hemocytes of the vibrio-challenged mussels. the hsps  showed instead opposing expression trends with only a couple of probes for small hsps down-regulated at  <dig> h post-challenge. these stress-inducible protein chaperons probably support pro-survival pathways but their multiple roles and complex expression patterns suggest further study  <cit> . in the same hemocyte samples, lectin-like and fibrinogen-like adhesion/recognition molecules showed heterogeneous expression trends whereas the frequent up-regulation of mussel genes relating to the cell shape and motility points to chemotactic and phagocytic hemocyte behaviour. the enhanced expression of litaf and persistent mif down-regulation in response to the injected bacteria encourage us to search regulatory mussel monokines with new immunostimulation trials and approaches other than dna microarray testing.

the samples tested on the immunochip exemplify only two temporal stages of the multi-step response to a reference dose of live v. splendidus cells. the observed transcriptional changes apparently mark the hemocyte activity against the vibrio cells with a mounting inflammatory response  and a shift towards a more general stress condition . a previous equal treatment of m. galloprovincialis with live v. splendidus, caused a dramatic increase in living intra-hemocyte bacteria in less than an hour, suggestive of intense phagocytosis, and a subsequent gradual decrease with only a few viable bacteria at  <dig> h post-injection  <cit> . recruited against active bacteria, the total counts of three distinct hemolymph cells  almost halved at  <dig> h post-injection and, after  <dig> h were still below the normal levels. full understanding of the complex and dynamic response of m. galloprovincialis to the bacterial attack requires further study.

the great number of deep sea vent mussel transcripts made available during manuscript submission  <cit>  and the launch of a new interproscan sequence search interface  will probably speed up the cross-species identification and validation of immune-related genes of marine bivalves. a partial comparison between mytibase and the deepseavent database  rescued  <dig>  annotated protein sequences expressed in both m. galloprovincialis and bathymodiolus azoricus  <cit> . new blastn queries performed with the mgc transcript sequences significantly modulated at  <dig> and  <dig> h in the vibrio-injected mussels against the  <dig>  transcript sequences of bathymodiolus azoricus confirmed the robustness of the mytibase annotations . such similarity searches also ascertained a not negligible sequence diversity of putative homologues  and the absence of typical amp . these findings, as well as previous comparative analysis of large est sets from m. californianus and m. galloprovincialis  <cit> , support the use of species-specific dna microarrays.

CONCLUSIONS
the great molecular diversification of pathogen binding molecules such as the insect down syndrome cell adhesion molecule  <cit> , snail freps  <cit> , sea urchin tlrs  <cit>  as well as the individual variant patterns reported for sea urchin 185/ <dig> molecules  <cit> ] and mussel myticins  <cit>  emphasize the emerging complexity and divergent evolution of the invertebrate immune systems. filter-feeding bivalves such as the mytilus species commonly interact with a 'sea' of microscopic living forms, and can reveal interesting adaptations to co-evolving invaders and environmental changes. as many proteins involved in the immune responses also participate in basic cell processes, evolutionary adaptations differ between and within taxa and the mytilus genomes are not yet available, the use of species-specific dna microarrays represent a rational choice for studying transcriptional profiles and co-expression landscapes, and to validate many immune-related candidate molecules.

in fact, mytibase includes almost all the domains featuring the innate prr, i.e. c-type lectin and ig-like domains, lrrs  domain, nucleotide-binding and toll-interleukin receptor domains, caspase recruitment and helicase domains  <cit> , and reports abundance and diversity of the c1q/tnf-like, lectin-like and amp mussel transcripts. using the protein domains as instructive identifiers of sequence homology and other bioinformatics tools, we have designed  <dig>  immune-candidate probes, organized them into a m. galloprovincialis immunochip and tested this new dna microarray with haemolymph samples exemplifying the early and late response to live v. splendidus cells. from one fifth to one fourth of the immunochip probes gave significant fluorescence signals, respectively, and indicated both the modulation of various cell processes and a very specialized hemocyte transcriptome. accordingly, the immunochip could be confidently used to expand the validation of candidate probes on hemocytes and also in other mussel tissues. the putative relational map resulting from the immunochip data certainly requires further study. in the meantime, a good number of mytibase sequences relevant to the mussel immunity such as for instance the fibrinogen-like peptides are the object of new studies  <cit> .
