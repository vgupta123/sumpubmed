BACKGROUND
three major advances in the development of resources for mapping canine disease genes have been: 1) the development of a radiation hybrid  map composed of large numbers of microsatellite markers and genes that link the canine and human genomes  <cit> , 2) the development of canine specific whole chromosome paints that have allowed preliminary assignment of conserved segments between human and dog  <cit> ; and 3) the publication of a  <dig> x genome sequence of the dog  <cit> . the most recently published rh map of the dog comprises  <dig> markers including  <dig> microsatellite-based markers,  <dig> canine-specific cloned gene sequences and expressed sequence tags , and an initial set of  <dig> canine-specific bac-ends  <cit> . the map was constructed using the rhdf5000- <dig> whole genome radiation hybrid panel  <cit>  and features markers mapped to  <dig> unique positions, defining an average inter-marker distance of one megabase . the map also defines a minimal screening set of  <dig> highly informative well-spaced markers, to be used in the initiation of genome-wide scans  <cit> . a well-defined synteny between the dog and human genomes was established as a function of this work  <cit>  and from extensive reciprocal chromosome painting studies  <cit> .

the above mapping efforts are complemented by the recent release of a  <dig> x sequence of a standard poodle genome  <cit> . the sequence includes  <dig>  million sequence reads that span approximately 78% of the genome. more than  <dig> million base pairs  align uniquely to the human genome, and the resulting alignment includes fragments of putative orthologs for  <dig>  of  <dig>  annotated human genes. the current alignment supports most of the proposed comparative segments, but suggests that the final comparative dog-human map will be composed of at least  <dig> comparative blocks  <cit> .

using the above resources, canine researchers have undertaken genome-wide screens for linkage to a variety of disease loci as well as morphological traits defining differences between breeds. many of these studies have met with success. disease loci have been genetically mapped or otherwise localized in the dog for several disorders including: vision-associated disease such as progressive rod cone degeneration, early retinal degeneration, cone degeneration, and collie eye anomaly  <cit> , kidney cancer  <cit> , narcolepsy  <cit> , rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , severe combined immunodeficiency   <cit> , hip dysplasia  <cit> , cystinuria  <cit> , bleeding disorders  <cit> , ceroid lipofuscinosis  <cit> , and copper toxicosis  <cit> . in addition, quantitative trait loci  have been identified for principal components defining skeletal variation and hip dysplasia  <cit> . in general, investigators have been able to use the existing resources to localize traits of interest to an interval of 10â€“ <dig> mb, but in most cases the causative gene remains to be identified.

to facilitate positional cloning efforts in the canine community, we have localized a large set of randomly selected canine-specific bacs onto the canine 5000-rad rh map, a subset of which we have also localized cytogenetically. the resulting map of  <dig> markers includes  <dig> mapped bac-ends,  <dig> of which have been fish mapped, to generate a dense, accurate and highly integrated map of the canine genome.

RESULTS
general rh map characteristics
this novel rh map of the dog genome contains  <dig> markers of three different types:  <dig> genes,  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> bacs. the map was generated by genotyping  <dig> new bac-end markers on the rhdf5000- <dig> panel, and recomputing the new vectors with those from the previous map  <cit>  using multimap  <cit>  and tsp/concorde  <cit> . table  <dig> summarizes the key features of the new map. the typing of  <dig> markers resulted in an rh map containing  <dig> markers that were eventually grouped and assigned to each of the canine chromosomes, leaving only  <dig> unlinked markers. human orthologs were identified for  <dig> mapped markers. the resolution limit of the rhdf <dig> panel has been determined to be  <dig> cr <dig>   <cit> . thus, markers falling within any  <dig> cr <dig> or  <dig> kb stretch cannot be ordered relative to one another with high confidence and, consequently, are reported as co-localized on the map.

analysis of the entire dataset of  <dig> rh vectors by multimap  <cit>  at a lod score of  <dig> , and for a subset of regions a lod of  <dig> , resulted in  <dig> individual linkage groups that could be assigned to the  <dig> canine autosomes and two sex chromosomes. for chromosomes that were covered by multiple linkage groups, the data were merged and ordered as described in the methods. fish data combined with significant lod scores between selected markers led to the unambiguous assignment and orientation of specific linkage groups to chromosomes and, ultimately, complete coverage of each chromosome.

the resulting  <dig> linked markers defined  <dig> unique positions regularly spaced across all autosomes. the largest chromosome, canine chromosome  <dig> , contains  <dig> markers, while cfa  <dig>  the smallest chromosome at  <dig> mb, has only  <dig> markers . excluding the sex chromosomes, the least dense chromosome, cfa  <dig>  has a marker located every  <dig>  mb, while the most dense, cfa  <dig> and cfa  <dig>  have markers positioned at an average of every  <dig>  mb. the increase in density is due solely to the addition of  <dig> new bac-ends, bringing the total to  <dig> from the  <dig> reported in the previous version of the map. the mean interval size is now  <dig>  mb. the chromosome with the most bacs mapped to it is cfa  <dig>  featuring  <dig> localized to  <dig> unique positions . see all chromosomes in the supporting online material  at . again, the chromosome with the fewest is cfa  <dig>  with  <dig> bacs localized to  <dig> unique positions. this resource provides a dense scaffold on which to build regional physical maps and search for new genes. of particular interest to disease gene mappers will be the  <dig> bacs that are rh mapped to the x chromosome,  <dig> of which are also localized by fish. only two bacs were localized to the y chromosome, one of which is also fish mapped. see table  <dig> for details.

fish mapped bacs
a total of  <dig>  bacs were assigned to a chromosome band, and then ordered along the length of the corresponding chromosome using a combination of metaphase and interphase multi-color fish. cfa  <dig> is shown, for example, in figure  <dig>  the panel of fish mapped clones included clones representing both ends of each chromosome, with the exception of the centromeric end of cfa  <dig>  and the centromeric 20% of cfa  <dig> . nine hundred and eighty-one out of  <dig>  bacs had a unique cytogenetic location, and  <dig> were also ordered on the rh map. this yielded an average of one bac-end that was both fish and rh mapped every  <dig>  mb. see som material for data on all chromosomes and .

integration of fish and rh data
analysis of co-linearity between the two maps was performed by connecting the bac markers in common between the rh map and fish data. this approach allowed the identification of markers that serve as anchors to each chromosome for both rh and fish maps, thus validating their localization and marker order. early in the assembly process, a small number of discrepancies between the two maps were easily identified through graphical drawings of all chromosomes, leading to a systematic re-examination of experimental data and, in most cases, consensus resolution. however,  <dig> bacs did not have one unique cytogenetic location. these are indicated with a double asterisk in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  as well as the som and figures provided on all web sites. for each of these  <dig>  one of their fish localizations was in agreement with the corresponding rh map position. in addition, seven  had an identified human ortholog that was in agreement with the rh map localization. for an additional set of  <dig> bacs, conflict remained after rechecking both the fish and rh data. these are indicated by "#" in all figures. interestingly, the dna used to obtain fish data for these clones pcr amplified successfully with the same primers used to obtain rh data, indicating that the dna samples were the same and had not undergone sample mix-up. finally, a human ortholog sequence was identified that was in agreement with the rh data for  <dig>  of these clones.

although we have no clear explanation for these discrepancies, it is of note that the two mapping methods used different dna sequences to define the same marker. in the rh method, a pair of 25-mer oligonucleotides defining only one end of the dog insert dna is used. by comparison, in the fish analysis, the whole bac encompassing approximately  <dig> kb is hybridized. since the dna for the fish localization was prepared from cultures initiated from single bacterial colonies, these anomalies suggest that at least a subset of the clones may be chimeric. an additional explanation is that the clones are hybridizing to genomic regions containing one member of a multi-gene family. whatever the explanation for these discrepancies, it is noteworthy that the total number of discrepancies between the fish and rh data represent 3% of the total data. this is in agreement with reports that the frequency of chimeric clones in this bac library is very low  <cit> . thus, in most cases, the co-linearity of the fish and rh maps is perfect, i.e. the order of the bacs determined by multi-color fish is identical to that derived from analysis of genotyping data using primers defining single bac-ends.

in addition to the conflicting results described above, in some cases, we note that the order for two closely positioned markers is inverted between the fish and the rh data. however, for all of these cases the distance between the two markers is estimated to be less than 50â€“ <dig> kb, as these clones overlap in interphase nuclei. thus, they are well within the  <dig> kb resolution limit of the rh <dig> panel. such minor inaccuracies in marker order will not be detrimental to gene mapping, as the integrated map has fixed positions every  <dig>  mb with support from fish data. the example of cfa  <dig> is provided . please refer to som and websites for all other chromosomes.

synteny and conserved segments
two criteria were used to assign dog bac clones to orthologous locations of the human genome. first, when compared to the complete human genome, each component of the paired end-sequences had greatest similarity to locations that are separated by 50â€“ <dig> kb. although most bac clones have inserts of 100â€“ <dig> kb, minor differences between the two genomes such as local duplication or loss of specific genes should be accommodated by the 50â€“ <dig> kb range. if one considers a single aligned end-sequence, the probability of the paired end-sequence aligning spuriously within  <dig> kb in the human genome is approximately  <dig> %. the second criterion was that each pair of end-sequences should align in a head-to-head orientation. with this additional condition, the probability of scoring pairs that contain spurious alignments falls to less than  <dig> %.

in the most recent version of the map  <cit> ,  <dig> conserved segments  were detected within the  <dig> canine autosomes. in addition, two cs corresponding to the sex chromosomes and nine singletons were detected. these  <dig> cs were identified through the analysis of  <dig> canine markers having an unambiguous ortholog in the human sequence. in the present map, that number is more than doubled with  <dig> markers having an ortholog in the human sequence. these newer data confirm all previously described cs, and incorporate two singletons into two novel cs for a new total of  <dig> cs. for the sake of clarity, the remaining singletons were not reported in this new version of the map.

interestingly, while the number of cs did not change significantly compared to the previous iteration of the rh map, their nature and composition were altered, as shown for cfa  <dig> . four cs were identified for cfa <dig> that correspond, in order from centromere to telomere, to human chromosomes   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  from the density of markers for which an ortholog can be identified, it is clear that the order of markers is consistent between cfa  <dig> and hsa  <dig>  thus, this cs would be considered a "conserved and ordered segment" . for the cs corresponding to hsa  <dig>  however, two sub-segments are noted which are caused by an inversion. in each of these two sub-segments, the order of markers is comparable to the syntenic portion of hsa  <dig>  and each canine segment would independently be considered a cso.

in addition to identification of some previously unknown cso, the increased number of markers for which a human ortholog could be identified unambiguously allowed for a substantial increase in the size of many previously identified cs. at present, as shown in figure  <dig> and som, cs in the dog are highly contiguous with the human genome. indeed, only a few markers identified as human orthologs fall outside of a cs. this significantly refines our knowledge of evolutionary breakpoints between the dog and human genomes.

discussion
the  <dig> markers that constitute this new map occupy  <dig> distinct positions, with an average of  <dig>  markers per position. this reflects the fact that with  <dig> genotyped markers, we are approaching the saturation level of  <dig> markers predicted on the basis of size of the canine genome, and resolving power of the  <dig> rad panel  <cit> . a detailed analysis of the co-localized markers indicates that in the majority of cases markers are co-positioned with other markers of different types, i.e. bacs and microsatellites, or microsatellite and genes, etc. thus, all of the data will likely prove useful for mapping and cloning genes of interest, as the information provided at each location is non redundant. in addition, even when markers of the same type are co-localized, they are likely to be of value; any given microsatellite is not informative in every pedigree, and closely localized bacs may represent the beginning of an overlapping contig.

a direct consequence of markers mapping to the same positions is that the mean distance between two adjacent positions is now  <dig>  mb, which is very similar to the  <dig> mb calculated for the most recent published version of the canine map  <cit> . again, this reflects the resolving power of the  <dig> rad panel  <cit> , as well as the method of map computation. tsp/concorde considers markers co-localized if they map to a region of  <dig>  mb or less, regardless of rh panel mapping power  <cit> .

the number and identity of conserved segments  between the human and the dog genomes is  <dig>  cs were identified by both fish localization and rh mapping with four chromosomes showing four human/dog cs, and the remainder showing one to three. the number of markers and the resolving power of the  <dig> rad panel allowed us to detect several instances in which cs appear to be split in sub-segments. in several such cases, the order of markers in the two adjacent sub-fragments is conserved, although the two sub-fragments are oriented in opposing directions. following the previously agreed definitions, these sub-fragments are termed cso for "conserved segment order"  <cit> . such a situation is observed in cfa  <dig> . in other instances, one of the two adjacent sub-fragments appears to correspond to a cso, while the other corresponds to a cs. obviously a better distinction between cs and cso segments would require genotyping of additional markers, ideally on a panel constructed with a higher dose of radiation, and with concomitantly higher resolution. such experiments are currently underway using  <dig>  genes derived from the available dog genome sequence  <cit>  and a newly constructed  <dig> rad panel .

as shown in table  <dig>  and as indicated in the results,  <dig> bacs were localized both by fish and rh mapping, with a high level of concordance between the two methods. thus, the map presented here provides a verified anchor point every  <dig>  mb. unlike a fish map that is not altered or modified by the addition of a new dataset, an rh map does change after adding information because different algorithms provide different solutions for local marker order. each is statistically valid when ordering the same set of markers. however, discrepancies may arise as more markers are added to the map. moreover, even one algorithm can generate maps with slightly different marker orders within localized regions, even when only minor adjustments are made to the dataset like removing seemingly redundant markers  <cit> . in the present study, the high degree of anchorage by a set of markers localized in different laboratories with differing technologies yields a high level of confidence for the integrated fish/rh map.

of interest to many researchers will be the multiple applications that a cytogenetically defined and rh verified set of canine bac clones can provide. for example, the ordered set of  <dig> fish mapped canine bac clones with a unique cytogenetic location will be welcomed by cancer geneticists as a means to characterize chromosome aberrations in canine tumors. the dense cytogenetic coverage available for most chromosomes allows the use of serial differential labeling of some or all clones in chromosome-specific panels designed to 'tile' structurally aberrant chromosomes. this approach will allow a much more accurate assessment of chromosome rearrangements than is possible with single color whole chromosome paint probes. in addition, the ordered clones will allow expansion of the current canine bac microarrays, which in turn may be used for a variety of applications including array-based comparative genome hybridization  analysis of canine tumors  <cit> , array-painting of aberrant canine chromosomes, and investigation of cytogenetically cryptic copy number changes and gene dosage alterations in congenital abnormality syndromes. in addition, ordered arrays of bac clones will be an important resource for refining the comparative cytogenetic data within the diverse karyotypes that comprise the canidae. finally, with the imminent release of the 7x canine genome assembly, the resources described in this paper will provide a long-awaited means to translate canine cytogenetics data into canine dna sequence data, thus advancing our knowledge of canine and comparative genomics.

CONCLUSIONS
the presentation of a map containing  <dig> canine specific genes,  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> bacs provides the canine genetics community with nearly all the resources it needs to undertake experiments aimed at both mapping and cloning traits of interest. a dense set of microsatellite markers  for undertaking genome wide scans was provided in the previous iteration of the map  <cit> . these same markers are integrated into the current map. thus, within  <dig> / <dig>  mb of any linked marker on the current map is now an array of anchored bacs for contig building, comparative mapping, and searching for new genes and splice variants. the current map defines some  <dig> conserved segments between human and dog. while we expect this number to approximately double when the 7x canine genome sequence is completed, we speculate that given the density of markers mapped and the distance between adjacent cs, new cs defined by the 7x sequencing effort will be short in size and harbor a limited number of genes. what remains in canine genome map building is the development of a very high resolution gene map that can assist in the assembly of the 7x canine genome sequence now underway, and provide a mechanism for moving easily between canine and human comparative segments. this is currently being undertaken. in the meantime, canine researchers can move forward with the continued development of the dog model for mapping and cloning genes of interest to both human and companion animal health.
