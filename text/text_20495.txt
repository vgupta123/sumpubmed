BACKGROUND
retrotransposons are mobile dna elements that mobilise via a copy-paste mechanism using an intermediate rna to propagate new copies throughout the host genome. as a consequence of their activity, these repeated sequences can make up large proportions of eukaryote genomes. non-long terminal repeat  retrotransposons mobilise using a target-primed reverse transcription  mechanism involving the use of the 3′ hydroxyl group at a dna break to prime the reverse transcription of their rnas  <cit> . as a consequence of this tprt mechanism, short direct target site duplications  flank the newly inserted copies.

non-ltr retrotransposons can be classified into long and short interspersed nuclear elements . lines are mobilised in an autonomous fashion by the retrotransposition machinery they encode. they contain one or two open reading frames  and are transcribed and translated by the cellular machinery. sines, which have no orf and code for no protein, are mobilised in trans by the line-encoded enzymatic machinery. sines are either products of line orf deletion, with preservation of the line sequence 5′- and 3′-ends  or chimeras of cellular, viral or other transposable element rnas  that carry an internal promoter in the 5′-end region .figure  <dig>

trypanosomatid genomes are highly colonised by repeats of mobile elements belonging to the l1tc/ingi clade ; these elements are the best represented retrotransposons in these organisms  <cit> . l1tc and ingi are lines found in the genomes of trypanosoma cruzi <cit>  and trypanosoma brucei <cit> , the agents responsible for american and african human trypanosomiasis  respectively. l1tc is a potentially functional autonomous retrotransposon that encodes its own retrotransposition machinery, which involves apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, reverse transcriptase, rnase h, and nucleic acid chaperone activities . nartc  and rime  are truncated versions of the l1tc and ingi elements respectively. trypanosoma and leishmania spp genomes also contain highly degenerate elements of long and short length related to retrotransposons of the l1tc/ingi clade named dires   <cit>  and siders  respectively . these elements are unable to mobilise by themselves.

while the transcription of several non-ltr retrotransposons is driven by an internal promoter encoded at their 5′-end , others are transcribed starting at host promoters located upstream of the element insertion site  <cit> . recently, a hepatitis delta virus -like ribozyme has been described as the device responsible for the release of retrotransposon rnas in the insect r <dig>  and the t. cruzi l1tc  elements . catalytic cleavage occurs just upstream of the ribozyme domain. other members of the hdv-like ribozyme family have been described in the human genome  <cit>  as well as in insects, plants and fish, in which they have been shown to be functional  <cit> .

l1tc/nartc and ingi/rime are the most abundant repeat elements in the t. cruzi and t. brucei genomes. the 77 nt-long conserved sequence at their 5′-ends, known as the pr77-hallmark, has been shown to work as an internal promoter  and as an hdv-like ribozyme at the rna level  . this pr77-hallmark is also conserved in other lines and sines residing in the genome of trypanosoma vivax, trypanosoma congolense and t. brucei, as well as in dires of trypanosomatids and siders in the genomes of leishmania spp <cit> .

typanosomatid genomes are organised as large clusters of gene tandems constitutively transcribed by rna polymerase ii launched from regions between the clusters . the great accumulation of mobile elements within the ssrs suggests that pr77-hallmark promoter activity is involved in the epigenetic recruitment of rna polymerase ii  <cit> .

mature mrnas are generated by trans-splicing of a short-capped rna, called a spliced leader, which is transcribed from a widely repeated genetic unit via a unique polymerase ii external promoter. trans-splicing is coupled to the polyadenylation of the preceding pre-mrna unit in the polycistronic rna. the regulation of transcription is mainly attributed to post-transcriptional processes related to the stability of mrnas. it has been reported that unstable leishmania mrnas harbouring a sider <dig> retrotransposon in the 3′-untranslated region  are degraded by site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage that takes place at the 5′-end of the second 77-nt signature  .

the pr77-hallmark rna from l1tc has an hdv-like ribozyme secondary structure  <cit> . the rna region located immediately downstream of pr <dig> in l1tc, but not in nartc, attenuates the in vitro co-transcriptional activity of the ribozyme, probably via rapid t <dig> rna polymerase transcription. most likely, in vivo this region induces a structural switch of the 5′-utr after ribozyme cleavage . in vitro, the structure of the entire 5′-utr is recognised as a trna-like structure in l1tc by escherichia coli rnase p m <dig> rna  <cit> , suggesting that the 5′ utr switches into a structure involved in translation  <cit> .

this paper reports that hdv-like ribozymes are also present in most of the l1tc/ingi clade retrotransposons, which are ubiquitous in trypanosomatids. this suggests that, as observed for the r <dig> retrotransposon clade in insects  <cit> , they are the result of the phylogenetic inheritance of a common mobile element ancestor . they therefore likely have a common role in the genetic regulation of their hosts. pr77-hallmark promoter and ribozyme activities may play important roles in trypanosomatid genetic regulation.

RESULTS
identification of putatively active hdv-like ribozyme candidates related to the l1tc/ingi clade in trypanosomatids
a bioinformatic blast search of the eukaryotic pathogen resources database  was used to search for pr <dig> homologues in mobile elements of different trypanosomatid genomes . the pr77-hallmark consensus  <cit>  was used as an initial query in screenings . the putative hdv-like ribozyme structure of each pr <dig> signature was manually explored. the sequence of the identified mobile elements that adopted any folding compatible with an hdv-like ribozyme and the correspondant genomic annotations are given in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  for the in vitro analysis, those that better fitted the previously described folding requirements of the l1tc or r <dig> retrotransposons  were chosen.figure  <dig> 
selected ribozymes putatively active based on their folding. all the screened sequences  were manually folded and those compatible with previously described ribozyme requirements or with minimum alterations were selected for study. the leishmania spp sequences correspond to those identified in the sider elements of the insertion referred to in the text as insertion  <dig>  li/ldsider2b is included in the figure, even though it was not included in the study, to show that the first signature in leishmania sider <dig> elements is a candidate for ribozyme activity. helix p <dig> and pseudoknot p <dig>  are not correctly folded in the li/ldsider2b signature. watson-crick base pairs are depicted in blue and wobble ones in red.



sider elements were found in all the analysed trypanosomatid species. the members of the sider <dig> subgroup contained a single pr <dig> signature located at their 5′-end, while those of the sider <dig> subgroup contained two signatures . elements of the sider <dig> subgroup were identified in l. infantum, l. donovani, l. major, l. mexicana and l. braziliensis. the first signature of the sider <dig> elements seems to fit the hdv-like ribozyme folding of l1tcrz . sider copies from leishmania spp located in two different positions of the genome were selected for phylogenetic analyses . one of them  is located at the 3′-utr of the gene coding for a putative mitochondrial dead box protein. the other  is located at the 3′-utr of the gene coding for a hypothetical protein of unknown function which is conserved and syntenic in all publicly available leishmania genomes . only the ribozymes belonging to the insertion  <dig> siders in the different leishmania spp were assayed for the analysis of ribozyme function .

a single pr <dig> signature was found in t. congolense l1tco and nartco rz), and in t. vivax sider <dig> rz), with folding similar to that shown by the l1tc ribozyme. in addition, two in-tandem pr77-hallmarks were found in t. brucei sider <dig> rz, figure  <dig> and additional file 1: table s1) showing a hybrid folding of ribozymes l1tc and r <dig>  <cit> . no sider <dig> signature was found, either in t. brucei or t. congolense that fitted any folding compatible with an hdv-like ribozyme. thus, for in vitro transcription analysis, two elements were chosen from each species that showed minor structural disruptions rz and sider1βrz; figure  <dig>  additional file 1: figure s <dig>  figure s <dig> and table s1). the sider1β sequences were divergent enough to be detected in the screening using the consensus sequence described by bringaud f et al.  <cit>  as a query. this divergence was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis, particularly with respect to tbsider <dig> elements .

the position of each mobile element selected for the study was localised on a genomic map . the existing synteny in leishmania spp sider <dig> insertions indicates that these insertions were selected in the common ancestor of all the species. actually, the cladograms obtained from both insertions revealed a similar divergence to that previously described  <cit>  for l. infantum, l. donovani, l. major, l. mexicana and l. braziliensis  . the low robustness offered by the branching support value between l. mexicana and l. major in the insertion  <dig> cladogram , compared to that obtained for a different branching in the insertion  <dig> cladogram , points to the latter being more reliable . no consensus was reached for the position of l. tarentolae, which appeared in different positions in the cladograms for insertion  <dig> and  <dig>  and always associated with a weak robustness branching support value . moreover, its position relative to l. braziliensis could not be determined due to a gap in the genome sequencing that partially affects l. tarentolae insertion  <dig> and completely affects l. braziliensis insertion  <dig> and its neighbouring region.figure  <dig>

the localisation of leishmania spp siders in the 3′-utrs has been previously reported, suggesting that these sequences may play a regulatory role  <cit> . moreover, it has recently been shown that some of these sequence repeats promote the downregulation of the mrna where they reside via endonucleolytic cleavage prior to deadenylation  <cit> . the existence of a ribozyme in leishmania spp siders may be involved in this cleavage.

detection of co-transcriptional in vitro activity of the selected candidates
co-transcriptional cleavage activity was measured by resolving the transcription reactions of each ribozyme in denaturing polyacrylamide gels as previously described for l1tcrz  <cit> . since the cleavage point is expected to be located on the 5′-side of the + <dig> nucleotide of each ribozyme  <cit> , the addition of an upstream sequence to the transcription template allowed a cleavage to be detected via its two products: that of the upstream sequence region and the ribozyme catalytic sequence . to analyse the influence of the genomic sequence naturally located upstream of each ribozyme on ribozyme cleavage efficacy, two dna templates were generated for each ribozyme by pcr using specific primers: one bearing the sequence corresponding to the 20 nt-long region naturally located upstream of each ribozyme, and one bearing the 61 nt-long unrelated region from the pgem-t easy vector . these were fused to the pr <dig> sequence of each organism and employed in vitro transcription assays as indicated in methods. figure  <dig> shows the putative ribozymes selected for the in vitro transcription study, together with their acronym according to the trypanosomatid species and type of element to which they belong, and their nucleotide length. transcription reactions were performed at 37°c for 2 h. co-transcriptional cleavage activity was detected in l. infantum, l. donovani, l. major, l. mexicana, t. vivax and t. congolense for ribozymes lmsider2arz, li/ldsider2arz, lmexsider2arz, tvsider1rz, l1tcorz and nartcorz . no l. tarentolae ribozyme was assayed due to a partial sequence gap affecting signature i of insertion  <dig> of sider <dig> in the released genome, and a severe structural disruption in the signature i folding of insertion  <dig> of sider <dig> . signature i of l. panamensis sider <dig> at insertions  <dig> and  <dig> had severe structural disruptions . consequently these hallmarks were not assayed for hdv ribozyme activity either. the data show the ribozyme present in sider2arz from l. infantum, l. donovani, l. major and l. mexicana to be functional, but not that from l. braziliensis .figure  <dig>

ribozymes. the assayed rna constructs are shown in . the striped region indicates the ribozyme region/s, and the grey regions indicate those that do not, a priori, contribute to ribozyme function rz or the attenuator sequences in l1/nartcorz). the results of co-transcriptional cleavage reactions with the unrelated pgem-t easy  <dig> nucleotides and the natural upstream 20 nt-long sequence are shown in  and  respectively. the different cleavage products are presented using the same code as in figure  <dig>  the co-transcriptional cleavage quantification of the active ribozymes, performed in triplicate, is shown in .



the upstream and downstream regions flanking hdv-like ribozymes have been shown capable of influencing ribozyme catalytic activity  <cit> . the present data indicate that the sequence upstream of the ribozyme region may do this . the cleavage activity of li/ldsider2arz and lmsider2arz was moderate when the assayed upstream sequence was the 61 nt-long sequence upstream of the pgem-t easy vector cloning site . in contrast, li/ldsider2arz activity was reduced and lmsider2arz increased when the 20 nt-long wild type upstream sequence was assayed . lmexsider2arz activity was hardly detectable when combined with its wild type upstream sequence, and undetectable when the assayed upstream sequence was the pgem-t easy vector . despite the high level of conservation between the lm, li and lmexsider2a ribozymes and their upstream sequences, no clear pattern of misfolding interactions could be established that might justify the different influence exerted by the natural 20 nt-long and the unrelated 61 nt-long upstream sequences. the cleavage activity of native lmexsider2arz was very low compared to the rest of the functional ribozymes tested. this is consistent with severe folding abnormalities due to a base pair mismatch for the c1a <dig> nucleotides and a short  p <dig> helix .

the catalytic activity of the putative ribozymes in trypanosoma spp revealed tvsider2arz, l1tcorz and nartcorz to be highly active, independent of the upstream sequence . it is worth noting that none of the assayed sider ribozymes from t. congolense and t. brucei showed catalytic activity. this was expected for tcosider1αrz and tbsider1αrz, which have severe folding abnormalities, but not for the tcosider1βrz and tbsider1βrz which a priori show adequate folding . however, in this and other work  on promoter/ribozyme functionality, active ribozymes were detected in l1tc/ingi clade line members from t. brucei and t. congolense.

the effect on the activity of the l1tco and nartco ribozymes exerted by the region downstream of the pr <dig> signature rz and nartcorz constructs, see figure 4a) was also examined since this region attenuates the catalytic activity of l1tcrz  <cit> . although this inhibition may be the consequence of the rapid in vitro transcription velocity of the t <dig> rna polymerase  <cit> , it reveals the induction of an rna conformational switch . the results indicate that the 46 nt-long sequence naturally located downstream of the l1tco and nartco ribozymes inhibits their activity rz and nartcorz, see figure 4b and c; compare lines  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> in figure 4b and c; see figure 4d for quantification of the cleavage products). this result is different to that obtained for the t. cruzi homologous l1tc and nartc, in which only the downstream region of l1tc had an attenuating effect  <cit> . the inhibition detected with respect to l1tco and nartco is expected given the high degree of sequence conservation of the downstream region in both elements and their similarity to l1tc.

the nartco and l1tco elements showed strong sequence homology. however, the sequences located upstream of the pr77-hallmark in both elements are different, and only that of the selected nartco insertion exerted an inhibitory effect. this inhibition occurred only in the nartcorz construct ; it was not seen for nartcorz .

even when they met folding requirements, the active ribozymes of leishmania spp showed only moderate activity compared to those of trypanosoma spp . leishmania siders seem to concentrate in the 3′-utrs in some of the protein coding genes and to act as post-transcriptional regulation signals  <cit> . in this context, a very active ribozyme might promote mrna decay without any regulatory control, while moderately active ribozymes might be regulated by trans-acting rnas or protein factors etc., as has been suggested for some sider signatures  <cit> . however, under the present experimental conditions, no in vitro ribozyme function was detected for any of the pr <dig> hallmarks in the 3′-utr region of the genes showing downregulated mrnas  <cit>    <cit> .

kinetic parameters of co-transcriptionally active hdv-like ribozymes
kinetic assays of the cleavage reaction were performed for each co-transcriptionally functional ribozyme carrying the 61 nt-long pgem-t easy upstream fragment. uncleaved products were gel purified and renatured in mg2+-free buffer. the cleavage reaction started after the addition of mgcl <dig>  three different mgcl <dig> concentrations were assayed . the kinetic curves matched the two-phase decay model characteristic of hdv-like ribozymes .figure  <dig> 
cleavage kinetics of trypanosomatid hdv-like ribozymes. the uncleaved products of the transcription showed in figure 3c  and 4d were gel-purified and subjected to cleavage reaction. time course reactions at different mg2+ concentrations were performed. li/ldsider2arz, lmsider2arz, tvsider1rz and l1/nartcorz kinetic reactions at  <dig>  mm mg2+ are shown in . the lmexsider2arz kinetic reaction at 10 mm mg2+ is shown in . the time course  of the reaction is shown above each line; the empty arrowheads indicate uncleaved products; solid arrowheads indicate cleavage 3′ fragments; the empty circle indicates the cleavage 5′-fragment. all the ribozyme reactions fitted the two-phase decay kinetic curve shown in ; the plotted data are the results of independent assays performed in triplicate. a more extended study is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 



consistent with previous reports  <cit> , the cleavage activity of these hdv-like ribozymes in trypanosoma spp was greater under co-transcriptional conditions than after renaturation. the l1/nartco and tvsider <dig> ribozymes hardly cleaved after post-transcriptional renaturation, while their co-transcriptional cleavage rate was close to 100%. in contrast, leishmania spp ribozymes showed greater cleavage efficiency at 2 h post-transcription than after 2 h of transcription . this is consistent with a possible post-transcriptional regulatory function controlled by external factors. nucleic acids chaperones or other rna binding proteins might induce a refolding similar to that caused by heat shock prior to post-transcriptional cleavage .table  <dig>

l1/nartco
note: *means an ambiguous fitting, and ! means data probably over-estimated. in all cases, the ribozyme kinetics fitted the r <dig> coefficient two-phase exponential decay model better than the hyperbolic model.



it is remarkable that for tvsider1rz and l1/nartcorz, the uncleaved product became progressively less common in the presence of 10 mm mgcl <dig> but with no accompanying accumulation of any cleavage products . this may be an indication of some intrinsic instability of the uncleaved rna at this mg2+ concentration. thus, the cleavage rate of both ribozymes at this concentration is possibly overestimated. interestingly, lmsider2arz cleavage was more efficient at  <dig>  mm than at  <dig> or 10 mm of mgcl <dig> . it may be that an equilibrium displacement towards catalytic folding at  <dig>  mm allows nearly all rna molecules to achieve this state. at higher mg2+ concentrations, non-catalytically active folding may be stabilised, preventing catalysis.

cleavage point determination in functional hdv-like ribozymes
to confirm the putative ribozyme folding, the accuracy of the cleavage point prediction was checked. the cleavage point was expected to lie on the 5′-side of the + <dig> nucleotide of the ribozyme domain shown in figure  <dig>  the downstream cleavage products  obtained by the transcription of constructs using the 61 nt-long pgem-t easy upstream sequence were then gel purified and used as templates for primer extension using radiolabelled specific primers that anneal at the 3′-end of each ribozyme. for lmexsider2arz, the template used for transcription was the natural 20 nt region located upstream of the ribozyme - the only one that allows catalytic activity.

to provide size markers, a sequencing reaction was performed using the primers employed in the primer extension assays. the maximum extension products from each primer coincided with the + <dig> nucleotide  of the tvsider <dig>  l1/nartco, li/ldsider2a, lmexsider2a and lmsider2a ribozymes . additionally, rt extension stops consistent with those previously described on the 3′ side of the helix p <dig> 3′ strand  <cit>  were detected in all ribozymes except for tvsider1rz . these stops were associated with a very tight junction composed of three consecutive gc pairs that would hinder polymerase progression rz had only two gc pairs). thus, it is possible that a c1a <dig> pair in lmexsiderrz contributes to the formation of a tight structure.figure  <dig>

phylogenetic analysis of the origin of the l1tc/ingi ribozyme
the existence of hdv-like ribozymes in related mobile elements within trypanosomatids, their relatively large size and their complexity, together suggest that these ribozyme sequences were vertically transferred. the same has been concluded by other authors  <cit>  for the r <dig> retrotransposon ribozymes in insects. to examine this hypothesis, phylogenetic analysis was performed using the different isolated sider sequences. alignment of the sequences involved in the hdv ribozyme structure within the pr <dig> sequences of tbsider <dig> and lsspsider <dig>  and other siders with pr <dig> signatures of different length, required manual adjustment. these domains contain double stranded motifs and show sequence conservation that may have been promoted by selective pressure. the r2dwi_side sequence from drosophila willistoni, which belongs to the r <dig> retrotransposon clade, was used as a known external sequence for the phylogenetic study of the analysed in-group . this sequence was chosen since r2dwi_side is also a short length side element, and because it bears an hdv-like ribozyme at its 5′-end  <cit> . these features suggest r2dwi_side to be the closest relative to an hdv-like ribozyme-carrying element, yet it maintains enough genetic distance to be considered an outgroup.

the cladogram shows independent clades for the sider <dig> and sider <dig> elements. within the sider <dig> clade, the tbsider <dig> copies are clearly grouped. the tvsider <dig> and tcosider <dig> are also included within the sider <dig> clade and are closely related . lsppsider <dig> and tbsider <dig> are independently grouped within the same clade. the presence of a duplicated signature seems to have defined the differentiation of the sider <dig> and sider <dig> families before the radiation of the trypanosomatids. in this cladogram, the r2dwi_side clearly emerged as a group different to that in which the trypanosomatid siders collected. however, this clearly points towards the existence of a common ribozyme ancestor. the ribozymes of the r <dig> line and hdv show strong nucleotide differences when compared to those found in the trypanosomatid organisms. these differences affect critical ribozyme structures such as the orientation of the two or three gc pairs in helix p <dig> and the number of base pairs and their constituent bases in the p <dig>  pseudoknot . the present results confirm that the sequence/structure requirements used by webb ch. et al.  <cit>  for hdv-like ribozyme screening were too restrictive; the present approach seems to be more flexible . the results of the preliminary phylogenetic study performed here coincide with those of previous studies involving other molecular markers  <cit>  and support the idea that mobile elements as well as the extensive survey of retropositional events that might have occurred during the divergence among some eukaryotes may be used as a powerful method for making phylogenetic inferences  <cit> .

the hdv ribozyme belongs to a group of small catalytic rnas with members that catalyse a similar self-cleaving reaction  <cit> . for 18 years the only two described hdv ribozymes were those observed in hdv rna  <cit> . the high complexity of the hdv-like ribozymes explains why, until now, so few members have been described. the number of known hdv-like ribozymes is, however, now increasing, with examples even found in eukaryotic genomes . the present work localises these ribozymes in a well-characterised and conserved sequence known as the pr77-hallmark. the mobile nature of such retrotransposons may have promoted the spread of hdv-like ribozymes throughout trypanosomatids genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the pr77-hallmark is a well-conserved sequence of the l1tc/ingi clade retrotransposons in trypanosomatids. the present work describes hdv-like ribozymes in the pr77-hallmark of mobile elements of t. congolense, t. vivax, l. major, l. infantum, l. donovani and l. mexicana. the existence of hdv-like ribozymes in these organisms may be a consequence of vertical transfer of a mobile element from a common trypanosomatid ancestor. the ribozyme activity present in the largely immobile sider elements of leishmania spp <cit> , which are pervasively located in 3′-utrs  <cit> , suggests the occurrence of an exaptation event that turned these mobile elements into regulatory sequences.
