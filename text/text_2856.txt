BACKGROUND
tetraspanins constitute a large family of integral membrane proteins, characteristically containing  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> conserved cysteine residues in the large extracellular loop , which form disulfide bonds, and several conserved polar residues in the intracellular loop and transmembrane regions  <cit> . there are  <dig> putative tetraspanin family members in mammals,  <dig> in drosophila melanogaster and  <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans. tetraspanins play diverse roles in cell adhesion, migration and fusion processes, cellular activation and signaling . mammalian tetraspanins such as cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  rds/peripherin, and uroplakins ia and ib have been most extensively studied, with mouse knock-out models available for cd <dig>  <cit> , cd <dig>  <cit> , cd <dig>  <cit>  and a few others. however, the majority of tetraspanins are characterized very little, if at all, at genetic, biochemical or structural levels.

the large extracellular loop  of tetraspanins has received most attention, since it contains functionally important sites. sequence qrd  in cd <dig> is important for association with integrins, which has functional consequences for integrin-dependent cell spreading and multicellular cable formation  <cit> . a site in the lel of cd <dig>  sfq , is essential for cd <dig> function in sperm-egg fusion  <cit> . the crystal structure of tetraspanin cd <dig> lel revealed five α-helixes, a-e  <cit> . helices a, b and e form a relatively conserved region in tetraspanins, whereas the region between helices b and e is the most variable  <cit> . interestingly, the variable region contains most of the functionally important sites involved in tetraspanin protein-protein interactions.

a remarkable biochemical property of tetraspanin molecules is their ability to associate with a large number of other transmembrane proteins, including integrins, membrane-associated growth factors and receptors, mhc class ii molecules, ig superfamily proteins, and each other  <cit> . several of these lateral associations of tetraspanins are detected in "mild" detergents , but are disrupted by "strong" detergents such as triton x- <dig> or sds. multiprotein complexes of tetraspanins and associated molecules, also called the "tetraspanin web"  <cit> , may represent a distinct tetraspanin-enriched membrane microdomain  <cit> . the formation of this microdomain is influenced by palmitoylation of several conserved juxtamembrane cysteine residues in tetraspanins  <cit> .

the transmembrane domains, encompassing nearly half of a tetraspanin protein, are the most conserved part of the molecule . however, very little functional information is available on these domains. the differential detergent sensitivity of tetraspanin-tetraspanin associations suggests that hydrophobic interactions between tm helices may play a role. indeed, when the large extracellular loop  of cd <dig> is deleted, the molecule is still able to associate with other tetraspanins  <cit> . thus, tm domains are strong candidates for mediating tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions.

the importance of tm domain interactions in intramolecular organization was demonstrated in a study showing that cd <dig> fragment tm2- <dig>  lacking tm <dig>  was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, but was transported to the cell surface upon co-expression of tm <dig>  <cit> . this in vivo reconstitution experiment demonstrated a strong interaction between tm <dig> and the rest of the molecule. expression of a truncated cd <dig> molecule  results in intracellular accumulation of the protein and significant misfolding of the lel, as judged by inappropriate disulfide formation and diminished antibody reactivity . similarly, a cd <dig> epitope in the lel is lost in molecules lacking either tm2+tm <dig> or just tm <dig>  <cit> . thus, tm domain interactions and packing are crucial for proper folding, stability and transport of tetraspanin molecules.

in a previous study, we showed that covalent cross-linking of membrane-proximal cysteine residues can be used as a tool for detection of tetraspanin-tetraspanin associations  <cit> . inhibition of cysteine palmitoylation by 2-bromopalmitate  made cysteines available for cross-linking and enabled demonstration of specific tetraspanin homodimerization and low levels of heterodimerization. we concluded that tetraspanin homodimers, formed in the golgi, may be a fundamental structural unit within tetraspanin microdomains.

in this study, we carried out detailed sequence analysis of human tetraspanin tm domains. we show that a heptad repeat containing conserved glycine, asparagine and large hydrophobic residues occurs in tm <dig> and tm <dig> domains, and predict tight intramolecular association of these two domains by packing of the large residues against the small residues. moreover, by using cysteine cross-linking we map a dimerization interface in the human cd <dig> protein, and show that conserved heptad motif glycine residues are also important for intermolecular cd <dig> associations.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of tetraspanin transmembrane domains: presence of the heptad repeat motif
we focused our attention on  <dig> human tetraspanins identified from the swiss-prot and genbank databases. all tetraspanins have in common four hydrophobic stretches  of 20– <dig> residues, and contain highly conserved residues in the second extracellular loop, in particular the cys-cys-gly  motif. detailed analysis of the large extracellular loop sequences  <cit> , and dendrograms based on full-length alignment can be found in earlier studies  <cit> . the length of each transmembrane domain was established based on previous sequence analysis of tetraspanin sequences  <cit> , and on annotations to the database entries. manual adjustments based on sequence homology and hydrophobicity profiles were done to fully delineate the tm domains. the resulting lengths of tm domains were: tm <dig> –  <dig> residues; tm <dig> –  <dig> residues; tm <dig> –  <dig> residues; tm <dig> –  <dig> residues. two more residues could be added onto the n-terminal part of tm2; however, relatively small sequence conservation of these residues among tetraspanins and occurrence of polar/charged side chains in some tetraspanins precluded us from doing so for the global alignment.

figures  <dig> and  <dig> show a multiple sequence alignment of four tm domains of  <dig> human tetraspanins. for each position within the domains, consensus residues were determined and classified  in  <dig> categories: 1) large hydrophobic residues , 2) small residues , 3) cys, and 4) asn. when more than two types of residues occupied a given position in a tm, a dual-color pattern that reflected the prevalence of the particular residue type was used . cysteine residues were shown separately due to their importance as palmitoylation target sites. the highly conserved asparagine residue in tm <dig> was considered separately. no proline residues are found in tm domains 1– <dig> of human tetraspanins.

an inspection of the multiple sequence alignment reveals a repeating heptad amino acid pattern, n, in tm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . heptad repeats promote helical coiled coil interactions in multiple soluble and membrane-spanning proteins  <cit> . in the heptad repeat, hydrophobic residues in positions a and d are of special importance, as they directly mediate interhelical contacts by creating a tight knobs-into-holes packing in the coiled coil structure  <cit> . for instance, in the leucine zipper of the yeast transcription factor gcn <dig>  positions a and d contain val and leu residues, respectively, with an asn residue in a single a position forming a hydrogen bond across the gcn <dig> dimer interface  <cit> .

in tm <dig> of tetraspanins, highly conserved asn, gly and gly residues  appear at d positions of the heptad repeats, and residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are at a positions . in tm <dig>  residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  occupy a positions, whereas residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are at d positions. another highly conserved glycine, gly <dig>  occupies the 3rd g position in tm <dig>  in tm <dig>  the conserved pattern consists of two leucine residues  and a glutamate/glutamine residue  in a positions . two d positions are also conserved – phe/tyr <dig> and ile/val/leu <dig>  tm <dig> lacks a conserved heptad pattern and has only a single conserved position, glu/gln <dig> . these features of tm1- <dig> of tetraspanins are displayed on helical wheel diagrams .

analysis of tm <dig> sequences
the conserved asn-gly-gly motif, occupying designated d positions of the heptad repeat, is the most prominent structural feature of tm <dig>  we also compared sequences of cd <dig> orthologs from  <dig> different organisms  to gain further insight into conservation and variability of the tm <dig> sequence. as shown in figure  <dig>  positions a, d and g in tm <dig> are among the most conserved , while interspecies variability tends to occur in other positions: b , c , e  and f . thus, the positions typically involved in coiled coil interactions  are the most conserved.

when residues of tm <dig> are plotted as a helical wheel, additional structural features are revealed . there are highly conserved aliphatic and aromatic residues in the first three a positions of the heptad motif , as well as in g positions . the "ridges" formed by these bulky residues are flanking the "groove"-forming gly residues of the asn-gly-gly position d motif. in contrast, b, c, e and f positions show an overall higher variability among tetraspanins, as also seen in the comparison of cd <dig> orthologs described above.

analysis of tm <dig> sequences
a landmark feature of tm <dig> in tetraspanins is the presence of highly conserved glycine residues . other substitutions at these positions are almost exclusively small residues, such as ala or ser. in addition, ala, ser or thr occupy position  <dig>  this residue, together with gly <dig> and gly <dig>  forms face a of the helix. residue gly <dig>  is preceded by conserved, chiefly large hydrophobic residues on the same helical face . extremely conserved gly <dig> falls into heptad position g . among cd <dig> orthologs, heptad positions a and d are absolutely conserved, whereas other positions have the following number of substitutions: b – 3; c – 2; e – 1; f – 3; g –  <dig> . two of the f position residues in tm <dig>  also show higher variability among different tetraspanins . cysteine residues are frequently found near the cytoplasmic end of tm <dig> helix at positions  <dig> and 79; these cysteines are likely to be palmitoylated.

analysis of tm <dig> and tm <dig> sequences
the tm <dig> domain provides another example of the heptad repeat pattern. position a is occupied by two highly conserved leucine and a glutamate/glutamine residue . furthermore, two d positions are conserved – phe/tyr <dig>  and ile/val <dig> . in addition, residue  <dig> in position e is generally phe or leu. among cd <dig> orthologs, position a has  <dig> substitution, positions b, c and f each have  <dig>  positions d and e each have  <dig>  and g has  <dig>  thus, as for tm <dig> and tm <dig>  positions a and d are among the most conserved, but overall tm <dig> has more variable positions than tm <dig> or tm <dig> . less than half of tm <dig> sequences contain cysteine residues, and those tend to occur at the internal positions of the helix .

tm <dig> shows less conservation among various tetraspanin family members than the other tm domains . the only highly conserved feature is the glutamate/glutamine residue in position  <dig>  in addition, one or two cysteine residues can be found at the c-terminal end of tm <dig> in some tetraspanins , and many sequences contain additional polar residues . no conserved heptad motif was identified in tm <dig>  as also confirmed by analysis of substitutions in cd <dig> orthologs .

mutational analysis of conserved glycine residues in tm <dig> and tm2
the conserved nature of the asn and gly residues in tm <dig> and tm <dig> prompted an analysis of their functional role. to this end, we have probed whether mutations of these residues destabilize the protein molecule. we expressed a construct of the first and second tms of cd <dig>  connected by the small extracellular loop, and tagged with a c-terminal green fluorescent protein -gfp molecule). in human rhabdomyosarcoma rd cells, the wild-type fusion protein localized mostly in a reticular, intracellular pattern, without forming any large aggregates . remarkably, when double mutants gly25leu + gly32leu and gly67leu + gly74leu were expressed, the protein formed distinct large aggregates in a high proportion of cells . in contrast, double mutant gly77leu + gly80leu did not form such aggregates . results with respective single mutants were similar to that with double mutants, with the aggregation being somewhat more pronounced for leu substitutions of gly <dig> and gly <dig> compared to gly <dig> and gly <dig> mutations. no aggregation was observed for asn18ser and asn18tyr mutants . also, nearly identical results were obtained with human ht <dig> cells .

we interpret these results as an indication that aggregating mutants are destabilized or misfolded while non-aggregating mutants retain the wild-type conformation. intriguingly, mutations to the conserved gg <dig> motifs caused protein aggregation while the mutation of other glycines had no detectable effect. these results also suggest that wild-type gfp, which has weak tendency to self-associate, could enhance non-specific interactions of destabilized mutant tm cd <dig> moieties, leading to their aggregation. consistent with this hypothesis, the aggregation of gly25leu + gly32leu and gly67leu + gly74leu double mutants was suppressed when monomeric gfp molecule, leu221lys  <cit>  was used . the use of monomeric gfp did not affect intercellular localization of wild-type cd <dig> tm , or a gly77leu + gly80leu double mutant .

in summary, leu substitutions of gly residues that are part of the asn-gly-gly  motif in tm <dig>  or gly-gly-ala  motif in tm <dig>  resulted in destabilization and aggregation of gfp-fused tm proteins, whereas substitutions of gly <dig> or gly <dig>  which are not part of these motifs , failed to show such aggregation.

prediction and modelling of interaction between tm <dig> and tm2
consecutive helices in polytopic membrane proteins frequently interact  <cit> . sequence analysis of tm <dig> and tm <dig> helices of tetraspanins reveals a remarkable complementarity in the distribution of large and small residues at heptad positions a and d along the helical axis , suggesting that these residues may interact. to further elucidate the potential for tm1-tm <dig> interaction, the putative interface was modeled using a novel algorithm that considers mutational data during each step of a monte carlo simulated annealing cycle . specifically, gly25leu, gly32leu, gly67leu and gly74leu were scored as disruptive mutations, while asn18ser, gly77leu and gly80leu were scored as silent mutations, based on their effects on protein stability .

the resulting model predicts left-handed crossing of tm <dig> and tm <dig> helices at an angle of +28°. the key element of the structure is the apposition of bulky and small heptad position a and d residues, as follows: gly32-leu63; gly67-leu29; gly25-met70; gly74-trp22; asn18-gly77; ala81-phe <dig> . our model predicts that each of these residue pairs are in van der waals contact. additionally, two potential h-bonds are predicted in this model, indicating close packing: gly <dig> cα to gly <dig> carbonyl oxygen, and trp <dig> cα to met <dig> carbonyl oxygen. the packing is tighter in the ectodomain-proximal portion of the helices , as determined by cα-cα distances between interacting residue pairs.

the key elements of the model are corroborated by the presence of apparently complementary substitutions in tm <dig> and tm <dig> sequences of different tetraspanins . for example, gly <dig> is predicted to interact with trp <dig>  in  <dig> of the  <dig> tetraspanins that contain a substitution for gly <dig>  a compensatory substitution occurs at the trp <dig> position . thus, a larger non-glycine side chain at position  <dig> may necessitate a less bulky non-trp side chain in position  <dig>  likewise, the presence of a cβ at position  <dig>  typically occupied by glycine, necessitates a non-β-branched amino acid at position  <dig>  which is occupied by a β-branched residue in nearly half of all cases. indeed, we find that in each of  <dig> cases in which position  <dig> contains a cβ, a leucine residue occurs in position  <dig>  this analysis is consistent with our molecular model that suggests leu <dig> will pack most favorably against a cβ at position  <dig> than a β-branched residue or a methionine.

role of tm <dig> and tm <dig> heptad motif residues in cd <dig> dimerization
to probe cd <dig> dimerization, we used a cysteine-mediated cross-linking approach. we established previously a simple and efficient method for cysteine-mediated cross-linking  <cit> . after cells are pre-treated with 2-bp for 16– <dig> hours to expose normally palmitoylated cysteines, the cysteines can be cross-linked using any of the following methods: a) spontaneous oxidation in brij <dig> lysates , b) in situ cross-linking, by pre-lysis oxidation of cells with cu2+-phenanthroline  to promote disulfide bond formation. c) in situ cross-linking with thiol-reactive cross-linking agents of defined length . the first two approaches produce in essence "zero-length" disulfides, indicative of close proximity of target cysteines and presumably high specificity of interaction. in contrast, chemical cross-linkers with 6– <dig> Å spacer arm may cross-link with higher efficiency, but not necessarily higher specificity. however, they provide advantages such as variable membrane permeability, and potential linkage cleavability. for tetraspanins such as cd <dig>  membrane-permeable cross-linker dtme  provides highly specific and efficient cross-linking  <cit> . here we have used a cysteine cross-linking strategy, in combination with cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, to map the residues from tm <dig> and tm <dig> contributing to the cd <dig> dimerization interface.

for subsequent cross-linking experiments using cd <dig> tm-gfp protein, the non-dimerizing form of gfp was used. this avoids potential gfp-dependent dimerization and aggregation that can be observed with wild-type gfp, especially when fusions with transmembrane proteins are studied  <cit> . importantly, the leu221lys mutation in gfp prevented aggregation of mutant forms of cd <dig> tm, which was observed with wild-type gfp fusion . the tm fragment of cd <dig> contains three native cysteines – cys <dig>  cys <dig> and cys <dig>  single-cysteine mutants of tm were constructed, in which a cysteine was placed at various faces of tm <dig> or tm <dig> while all of the wild-type cysteines were simultaneously replaced by serines. the mutant proteins were transiently expressed in rd cells , which were then treated for 16– <dig> hours with 2-bp. to achieve maximal specificity in cross-linking we used a "zero-length" agent, cup.

first, single-cysteine replacements were constructed for residues leu <dig>  phe <dig>  gly <dig>  phe <dig> and asn <dig>  covering just over one complete helical turn at the beginning of tm <dig>  while residue asn <dig> is highly conserved, positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are occupied by bulky hydrophobic residues in most tetraspanins, whereas position  <dig> shows less conservation . all of the single-cysteine mutants showed diffused pattern of protein localization, without any signs of aggregation. as shown in figure 7a, the highest level of intermolecular cross-linking was observed for leu14cys and phe17cys mutants, a lower level for phe15cys and gly16cys mutants, and very little cross-linking for asn18cys substitution. these results indicate that: a) the first two transmembrane domains of cd <dig> alone can mediate its dimerization, and b) the g and c residues of tm <dig>  are likely to be part of the intermolecular interface.

similarly, single-cysteine substitutions were made for residues gly <dig>  gly <dig> and ala <dig> in tm2; in addition, proteins carrying a single wild-type cysteine, cys <dig>  cys <dig> or cys <dig>  were tested. no protein aggregation was observed for any of these single-cysteine mutants. as shown in figure 7b, the relatively low level of intermolecular cross-linking of wild-type cd <dig> tm-gfp protein was enhanced dramatically in single-cysteine tm <dig> mutants gly80cys and ala81cys. the gly77cys mutant also had an elevated level of cross-linking. in contrast, any of the three native cysteines  produced level of cross-linking not much greater than the wild-type tm protein. similar results were obtained with cysteine-reactive cross-linker bmb . likewise, comparable results were obtained with single-cysteine mutants of untagged, full-length cd <dig>  using cup  as well as dtme cross-linker .

these cross-linking results for tm <dig> and tm <dig> are consistent with our model that places residues leu <dig>  phe <dig> and gly <dig> on the same side of the tm1-tm <dig> pair . the strong cross-linking with leu14cys, phe17cys and gly80cys places the intermolecular interface toward the c and g phases of the tm <dig> helix, and the g phase of the tm <dig> helix, away from its e and f faces containing wild-type cysteines  <dig> and  <dig> 

critical residues at the tm1-tm <dig> interface also affect dimerization indirectly. to assess specific cd <dig> dimerization, we used a gly80cys substitution at the intermolecular interface for cross-linking. as shown in figure 8a, single replacements of conserved heptad residues in positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  strongly decreased the cross-linking mediated by cys <dig>  the effect was most pronounced for mutations of residues, gly <dig> and gly <dig>  located in the tightly packed extracellular end of tm helices . in contrast, mutations of residues closer to the cytoplasmic end of tm <dig>  had only modest to very little effect on cross-linking.

relatively low efficiency of intermolecular cross-linking via native residues cys <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  correlates well with the predicted location of cys <dig> and  <dig> away from the dimeric interface , and suggests that the extramembrane n-terminal part of cd <dig>  does not self-associate. we next examined whether mutations of conserved asn and gly residues in tm <dig> and tm <dig> decreased low-level background cross-linking via native cysteines. as expected, these mutations had virtually no effect on dimer formation of cd <dig> tm-gfp . the level of covalent dimer formed was not diminished for triple asn18ser + gly25leu + gly32leu and double gly67leu + gly74leu mutants, compared to wild-type tm cd <dig> molecule. similarly, the same triple and double mutations in the context of full-length cd9-gfp protein  produced wild-type levels of cross-linking . we interpret these findings as evidence for at least two types of associations between cd <dig> molecules: primary, involving residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and dependent on integrity of conserved heptad residues in tm <dig> and tm <dig>  and less efficient secondary interactions, probably representing random collision events, and independent of the heptad residues .

tm <dig> and tm <dig> cysteine residues in cd <dig> dimerization
after identifying the roles of conserved tm <dig> and tm <dig> residues in cd <dig> dimerization, we next probed whether residues proximal to tm domains  <dig> and  <dig> are also involved. to this end, disulfide cross-linking of full-length cd <dig> molecules containing  <dig> c-terminal cysteines  or  <dig> n-terminal cysteines  was compared . we found that the c-terminal cysteines were only slightly better than n-terminal cysteines with respect to detection of cd <dig> dimers. however, markedly more trimers and tetramers were detected using c-terminal cysteines. thus, residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> at tm <dig> and tm <dig> in cd <dig> can together form contacts across the dimeric interface and also additional contacts with other neighboring cd <dig> molecules.

discussion
here we provide the first detailed analysis of tetraspanin protein transmembrane domains. first, we show 1) the presence of a heptad repeat motif in tm <dig> and tm <dig>  containing highly conserved asn and gly residues, 2) a leucine and glutamate/glutamine-containing heptad motif in tm <dig>  and 3) high variability and absence of heptad repeats in tm <dig> sequences. second, we provide evidence for a specific, intramolecular interaction between tm <dig> and tm <dig> domains, in which bulky hydrophobic residues pack against gg <dig> motif, and present a molecular model for this interaction. third, experimental mapping of the cd <dig> dimerization interface firmly establishes an additional role for conserved tm <dig> and tm <dig> residues in dimeric intermolecular interactions. fourth, preliminary evidence is provided to suggest that tm <dig> and tm <dig> domains contribute to expansion of cd <dig> dimers into higher order multimers.

conserved residues in tm <dig> and tm <dig> of tetraspanins: role in intramolecular packing
we hypothesized that the first two transmembrane domains of tetraspanins might interact with each other because: a) consecutive tm domains frequently associate in known protein 3d structures  <cit> , and b) they both contain a series of highly conserved amino acids – several gly residues and an asn residue . conserved gly residues are a frequent theme in the organization of interacting transmembrane domains. analysis of 3d helix packing in polytopic membrane proteins reveals that gly residues tend to localize in buried positions, especially at the helix-helix interfaces and helix crossing points  <cit> . due to the absence of a side chain, gly provides a flat surface for packing of a side chain from another residue, without loss of side-chain entropy upon interaction. the most common gly-containing motif is gxxxg  <cit> . in glycophorin a , the major glycoprotein in erythrocyte cell membranes, gly <dig> and gly <dig> are part of the lixxgvxxgvxxt sequence that promotes homodimerization of parallel transmembrane α-helixes  <cit> . in the gpa dimerization motif, gly residues allow for tight packing in the right-handed helical crossing  <cit> . there are also examples of left-handed helical crossing in the context of a gxxxg motif  <cit> . other membrane proteins that use the gxxxg motif for homo- or heterodimerization include bacteriophage m <dig> coat proteins  <cit> , yeast alpha factor receptor  <cit> , integrin α iib subunit  <cit> , and erbb <dig> receptor tyrosine kinase  <cit> . other small residues, such as ala and ser, can substitute for gly in this motif  <cit> .

a protein motif in which gly residues are separated by  <dig> other residues  is also common in transmembrane helices, especially in transporter/channel-like membrane proteins  <cit> . however, the structural features associated with this motif are not well known. in particular, it is unclear whether left-handed gg <dig> heptad repeat motif  can drive membrane helix association. in a recent work addressing this issue, lear et al.  <cit>  showed that a synthetic peptide containing gly at heptad positions a and d could self-associate in vitro, likely in an antiparallel orientation. heptad repeats containing conserved gly residues occur in tm domains of α and β chains of mhc class ii proteins, and mutations of the gly residues disrupt the αβ heterodimer  <cit> . these examples demonstrate that gly-based heptad motifs may be used for both intra- and intermolecular associations.

in this work, we identified a highly conserved gg <dig> motif in the first two tetraspanin tm domains. the gg <dig> sequence in tetraspanins is a part of a larger motif that also includes a conserved asn residue in tm <dig>  and an ala/ser/thr residue in tm <dig> . the seven-residue periodicity of these motifs strongly suggests their involvement in left-handed coiled coil packing reminiscent of the leucine zipper, rather than right-handed packing of the gpa-like gxxxg motif. for antiparallel helices, the left-handed crossing is in fact predominant over the right-handed in known tm domain structures  <cit> .

in our model, heptad gly residues in ngg <dig> and gga <dig> sequences provide specific packing between antiparallel tetraspanin tm <dig> and tm <dig> helices by allowing tight van der waals interactions with large hydrophobic residues . highly efficient packing of bulky side chains against glycine residues is observed in known transmembrane protein 3d structures  <cit> . an example includes packing of helices m <dig> and m <dig> in potassium channel kcsa, where val <dig> in m <dig> is paired with gly <dig> in m <dig>  and leu <dig> in m <dig> contacts ala <dig> and gly <dig> in helix m <dig>  <cit> . in addition to facilitating helix-helix packing, gly residues frequently provide additional cαh...o hydrogen bonds between two helices  <cit> . in our model, two cα-backbone carbonyl h-bonds are predicted – between residues gly27-gly <dig>  and trp22-met <dig> 

although polar and charged amino acid residues  are infrequent in transmembrane domains, they are functionally important. polar residues such as glutamine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and asparagine can promote strong oligomerization of model membrane-associated helices  <cit> . ruan et al.  <cit>  used asparagine scanning mutagenesis to probe the interface of self-associating polyleucine helices by detecting their enhanced self-interaction in vitro and in the e. coli-based toxr assay. thus, a hydrogen bond in an apolar environment can result in strong, though not necessarily specific, association of transmembrane helices. in fact, mutations to polar residues in transmembrane proteins are commonly associated with disease  <cit> . because of this potential for non-specific interactions, polar residues tend to localize at buried positions in tm domains.

in our case, the conserved asn <dig> residue in cd <dig> is predicted to be a part of the tm1-tm <dig> interface, though our model does not predict any electrostatic interaction between asn <dig> and tm <dig> . consistently, substitution such as asn18tyr  in tm-gfp protein was not destabilizing as analyzed by protein aggregation. curiously, the full-length asn18ser cd <dig> migrated slightly slower on sds-page gel , suggesting that asn <dig> does play a role in maintaining conformation of the molecule. the asn18cys single-cysteine mutant shows very little intermolecular cross-linking , supporting the proposed location of this residue at the intramolecular interface. it is tempting to speculate that the "pocket" between tm <dig> and tm <dig> lined by asn <dig> and gly <dig> might be important for accommodating palmitate moieties that target cys <dig> and cys <dig> residues, and/or important for access by the putative palmitoyl transferase to those residues. understanding the exact role of these highly conserved asn <dig> and gly <dig> residues in tetraspanins awaits further investigation.

in summary, we identified conserved glycine residues of tm <dig> and tm <dig> of tetraspanins as key elements required for intramolecular packing. mutations of these key residues  resulted in protein destabilization and aggregation. there is ample evidence in the literature for mutations in transmembrane proteins that lead to protein destabilization, misassembly and pathologic conditions  <cit> . thus, we have identified conserved heptad gly residues in tm <dig> and tm <dig> of tetraspanins as plausible targets of destabilizing mutations with potential functional consequences.

intermolecular interactions in tetraspanins
tetraspanin cd <dig> forms mostly homodimers, but also a low level of heterodimers with cd <dig> and cd <dig>  <cit> . thus, mapping the dimerization interface is an important next step in structure-function analysis of tetraspanins. disulfide-mediated cross-linking, often in combination with cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, is a common strategy to probe oligomerization or intersubunit interactions of transmembrane proteins such as histidine kinase envz  <cit> , m muscarinic acetylcholine receptor  <cit> , e. coli lactose permease  <cit> , synaptobrevin  <cit> , integrins  <cit>  and many others. in tetraspanins such as cd <dig>  membrane-proximal cysteine residues are especially useful targets for disulfide trapping, as their linkage can be enhanced by pre-treating cells with 2-bp. while the ability of wild-type cysteines in cd <dig> to be cross-linked may indicate that they are close to the dimerization interface, more precise mapping was achieved here using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis.

our data clearly identify regions, near the cytoplasmic face of tm <dig> and tm <dig>  important for dimerization. intermolecular zero-length cross-linking was highest when single cysteines were placed in positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in tm-gfp molecule, or at positions  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> in the full-length cd <dig> protein. positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are distinct from the intramolecular interface and are on the same side of the tm1-tm <dig> pair . thus, they are well-positioned to participate in an interaction with another molecule. at the same time, the model predicts that wild-type cysteines , which do not yield very efficient zero-length cross-linking, are on the other side of tm1-tm <dig> pair.

while using the cysteine at position  <dig> as the dimeric interface probe, mutations of conserved residues in tm <dig> and tm <dig>  clearly reduced intermolecular cross-linking. we do not suggest that those residues are directly involved in intermolecular interaction. rather, we propose that destabilization of the intramolecular tm1-tm <dig> interaction by gly to leu substitutions  causes an overall conformational change that reduces dimer formation.

an ala81leu mutation did not reduce cross-linking via cys <dig>  even though single-cysteine ala81cys molecules themselves produced a high level of cross-linking. these results, together with data on gly32leu and gly67leu mutations, are consistent with our model predicting that helices  <dig> and  <dig> interact more tightly near the extracellular end and less at the cytoplasmic end. this would give more flexibility to a cysteine at position  <dig> and also limit the effect of an ala81leu mutation. location of this residue at the membrane/cytoplasmic border could also make it more accessible to cup reagent as compared to residues buried in tm domain, thus elevating the efficiency of disulfide formation of the ala81cys mutant.

multiple interfaces in tetraspanin molecules
in the full-length cd <dig> molecules, the  <dig> c-terminal cysteines  located at or in tm <dig> and tm <dig> promoted efficient dimer and even more efficient oligomer formation compared to the  <dig> n-terminal cysteines . cys <dig> alone can be used to capture cd <dig> dimers  <cit> . these results suggest the existence of two dimeric interfaces in cd <dig> molecule – the tm 1-2/1- <dig> interface and the tm 3-4/3- <dig> interface . in a tm molecule, the destabilization of 1– <dig> interaction, e.g. by gly→leu mutations, would affect the 1-2/1- <dig> interface, as discussed above. however, these mutations would not interfere with the 3-4/3- <dig> interface in a full-length molecule, which includes cys <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  thus, cross-linking of full-length molecules, containing all  <dig> cysteine residues, would be unaffected, as seen in figure 8c. furthermore, wild-type cys <dig>  cys <dig> and cys <dig> are apparently not at the primary 1-2/1- <dig> interface. their relative inefficiency in cross-linking cd <dig> tm protein likely reflects weak secondary contacts between the molecules, or possibly random collision events. such events should be independent of mutations in the conserved gly residues in tm <dig> and tm <dig>  as was demonstrated in figure 8b. the potential existence of two interfaces in tetraspanin molecules, 1-2/1- <dig> and 3-4/3- <dig>  should provide enhanced flexibility for forming additional intermolecular contacts. current understanding of tetraspanin microdomains assumes a few strong, primary homotypic and heterotypic tetraspanin complexes  that help bring together various other proteins, forming secondary-type associations. such properties of tetraspanins may bring signaling molecules such as protein kinase c or phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase to the vicinity of integrins  <cit> .

the organization of the tm <dig> domain points to a potential role in protein-protein interactions. a motif of leu-leu-glu spaced  <dig> residues apart , with highly conserved residues in two consecutive positions d, poses as a likely interaction module. if responsible for heterologous protein-protein interactions, it would form another distinct interface of tetraspanin molecule. our preliminary data indicate that replacing the leu and glu residues in tm <dig> of cd <dig> with ala has no effect on cell surface expression of the protein and its dimerization . it remains to be tested if interactions with other proteins will be affected. similarly, the tm <dig> domain may provide additional contributions to lateral tetraspanin associations. much higher sequence variability, and the lack of a distinct heptad pattern suggests that tm <dig> is a major contributor to diversity among tetraspanin complexes. structure-function analysis of tm <dig> and tm <dig> domains in tetraspanins is the subject of ongoing investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have defined the tm1-tm <dig> intramolecular interface in tetraspanin cd <dig>  providing evidence for glycines  packing against apposing bulky aliphatic residues. second, we mapped an intermolecular cd <dig> interface  to the vicinity of residues leu <dig> and phe <dig> in tm <dig> and gly <dig>  gly <dig> and ala <dig> in tm <dig>  finally, we provide preliminary evidence that tm <dig> and tm <dig> in cd <dig> may contribute to a second intermolecular interface. key cd <dig> residues involved in intra- and intermolecular interactions are highly conserved throughout the tetraspanin family, thus suggesting that our findings will apply to most tetraspanins.
