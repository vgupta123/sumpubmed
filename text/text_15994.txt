BACKGROUND
plants produce a broad array of peptides, short proteins of approximately  <dig> residues or less, largely involved in defense processes  <cit> . with the exception of phytochelatins  <cit> , these plant peptides are ribosomally synthesized either as mature products or precursors that are post-translationally modified  <cit> . the plant peptides vary in size, composition, and mode of action, and many have been associated with defense against pathogens and predators.

these defense-related peptides accumulate either constitutively or are induced by injury/infection  <cit> . the plant defensins, for example, are encoded by a multigene family with small  cysteine-rich protein products. while defensins can constitutively accumulate in plant tissues, specific family members are induced by a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . defensin gene products have been shown to have anti-microbial activities, and have been successfully employed as transgene products in number of plants, including citrus  <cit> .

in a study designed to identify citrus genes transcriptionally up-regulated by insect herbivory, a short transcript encoding an unknown 50-residue protein was identified  <cit> . designated csv03- <dig>  in citrus leaves this transcript was shown to accumulate in response to application of methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, abscisic acid and abiotic stress  <cit> . three additional transcripts with >90% identity to csv03- <dig> were identified in the est database, indicating that it was a member of a gene family. the small proteins encoded by the transcripts were shown to bind dsdna, and the family was designated as a new class of defense-related nucleic acid binding proteins  <cit> . however, unrelated investigations of citrus peptides with potential pharmaceutical applications  <cit>  identified small cyclic citrus peptides with precursors closely related to the csv <dig> family, suggesting csv <dig> membership in a more diverse gene family encoding cyclic peptides  <cit> .

here we describe the structure, expression, evolutionary profile and genomic distribution of members of a diverse gene family of csv03-related scampps. in addition, we show that one of the members, highly expressed in phloem tissue, encodes a cyclic peptide with the potential to act as a k+ carrier ionophore.

RESULTS
scampps peptides
while the four previously described csv <dig> transcripts were identified as encoding nucleic acid binding proteins  <cit> , these proteins show considerable similarity to three cyclic-peptide precursors characterized in unrelated studies   <cit> . the two cyclic peptides from c. aurantium as well as the one from c. natsudaidai are in all likelihood derived from precursor proteins closely related to the four csv <dig> proteins   <cit> . this implies that the csv <dig> genes belong to a larger, and more diverse, family than previously indicated  <cit> . it has recently been suggested that small peptides cyclized n-to-c and lacking disulfides be referred to as orbitides  <cit> .figure  <dig> alignment of scampps precursor proteins and structure of scampps genes.  alignment of the precursor deduced amino acid sequences scampps- <dig> , scampps- <dig> , scampps- <dig> , scampps- <dig> , citrus aurantium- <dig> , citrus aurantium- <dig>  and citrus natsudaidai . boxes indicate predicted cyclic peptide product domains.  representation of a model citrus scampps gene. locations of precursor codons are indicated in dark blue, cyclic peptide product codons in light blue. exon and intron positions indicated by brown and white boxes.  deduced amino acid sequences of c. clementina scampps located on chromosome  <dig> at positions  <dig>   and  <dig>  mb .



in order to more fully characterize this gene family, a consensus sequence  was used to probe the c. sinensis  <cit>  and c. clementina  <cit>  genome assemblies. a total of  <dig> loci with similarity to the consensus sequence were identified on the c. clementina genome , and of these  <dig> were associated with ests  indicating that they represent expressed genes. a total of  <dig> similar loci were identified on the c. sinensis draft genome,  <dig> of which are associated with ests. the expressed genes had the structure indicated on figure 1b, with two exons separated by an approximately 100 bp intron. while the coding sequences of these genes  are short, the transcripts contain relatively long 5’ and 3′ utrs resulting in transcripts of approximately 450 bp . thirty-three of the expressed genes in c. clementina have at least 99% identity to the c. sinensis orthologs. the deduced amino acid sequences of the encoded precursor proteins, verified in two independent assemblies and the est database, are aligned in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> alignment of scampps precursor proteins. deduced scampps precursor protein sequences from citrus for gene products found in both the citrus sinensis and citrus clementina genomes as well as the citrus est database. the predicted cyclic peptide product sequences are indicated, as well as the chromosome number and position  on the encoding gene citrus clementina genome. the scampps precursor consensus sequence is indicated in blue.



the alignments shown in figure 1c support identification of the proteins in figure  <dig> as precursors processed to the small predicted cyclic final products indicated. all three of the previously verified citrus precursors  <cit>  align with specific expressed c. clementina deduced proteins. as a majority of the deduced cyclic products contain a combination of both non-polar/hydrophobic, and polar/charged residues, members of this gene family are referred to as small cyclic amphipathic peptides, or scampps. the previously described cyclic proteins from citrus aurantium and citrus natsudaidai are clearly members of this set .

the scampps precursor product from  <dig>  mb on c. clementina chromosome  <dig>  has been entered to align the -wse- amino-terminal processing site proposed for the other precursors. however, the structural features of the deduced precursor suggests that processing of this peptide results in the underlined gvpiwpywn predicted cyclic peptide.

the processing of the caryophyllaceae orbitide precursors in developing seeds to final, cyclic, products has been shown to occur in two steps  <cit> . initially, the precursors are cleaved at the n-terminal end of the cyclic product by an oligopeptidase, followed by secondary cleavage at the cyclic peptide c-terminus and formation of the final product via a specific cyclase  <cit> . while there is no sequence similarity between the citrus and caryophyllaceae precursors, their structural similarity  <cit>  suggests a similar biosynthetic pathway.

the amino acid content of the scampps predicted cyclic peptides are enriched in non-polar amino acids  relative to expected frequencies  <cit> , and while there is an overall decrease in charged residues, the ratio of basic to acidic amino acids is high in the scampps peptides . this composition is consistent with peptide attachment and insertion into biological membranes  <cit> .

scampps transcription
based on representation in the available citrus est database  <cit> , the individual scampps gene family members can have strikingly different transcriptional profiles . for example representation of individual scampps in cdna libraries from c. sinensis phloem  and c. clementina ovary abscission zone c  can be compared. scampps- <dig>  scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> are highly represented in the phloem and under-represented in the ovary abscission zone, while the reverse is true of scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> .

a sequence comparison of ests encoding scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  these ests are identical prior to the intron, and diverge thereafter. while these mrnas share 97% identity outside the predicted cyclic peptide domains, the cyclic peptide coding sequences more divergent and result in five residue scampps- <dig>  and eight residue scampps- <dig>  cyclic peptide products that share only three common residues. a hypervariable domain is clearly apparent in the alignment as the domain encoding the final cyclic product. these two mrnas share 100% identity in the domain 5′ to the intron processing locus with less conservation 3′ to the cyclic product.figure  <dig> alignment of scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> mrna  <cit> . scampps <dig>  and scampps <dig> . coding domains are indicated in green, mismatches in red. the position of the intron relative to the genomic sequence is indicated by the arrow.



the pattern of sequence divergence, specifically targeting the predicted cyclic peptide-coding domain, is observed in other scampps ests with similar expression profiles . for example, an alignment of scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> ests is shown in figure 4a. while these ests share 97% identity outside the cyclic peptide domain , the cyclic peptide domains share only 43% identity resulting in cyclic peptides  that share only two common residues . this pattern is also observed in comparison of the scampps- <dig> est with an orthologous est from p. trifoliata, an evolutionary divergence of approximately  <dig> million years  <cit> . these transcripts share 95% identity outside the cyclic peptide domain, while the localized changes in the cyclic peptide domain result in  <dig> and  <dig> residue peptides that share a single common residue .figure  <dig> alignment of citrus scampps- <dig> with scampps- <dig> and ortholog from poncirus trifoliata mrna.  alignment of scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> ests. scampps- <dig>  and scampps- <dig> . coding domains are indicated in green, mismatches in red. position of the intron indicated as in figure  <dig>   alignment of scampps- <dig> est and an orthologous est p-scampps- <dig>  annotated as in  above.



the pattern of hypervariability within the predicted cyclic peptide-coding region is a common feature within paralogous/orthologous collections of scampps-encoding ests . this type of hypervariability is common in gene families that mediate interactions between organisms, the conotoxins  providing perhaps the best example  <cit> . the accelerated mutation rates associated with the cyclic peptide domains could reflect either a strong positive selection or specific hypermutation. in the conotoxin case, a targeted mutagenic process producing short hypervariable stretches within the mature toxin domain has been proposed  <cit> . alternative mechanisms for targeted changes within the conotoxin coding region based on formation of highly stable secondary structures within conserved regions  <cit>  do not appear applicable in the scampps genes as they lack obvious potential for such secondary structures in the conserved regions.

genomic structure of the citrus phloem scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> genes
while coding for distinct cyclic peptide products, the first exons of scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> mrnas are identical . the c. sinensis chr <dig> assembly  <cit>  contains single scampps- <dig>  and scampps- <dig>  loci. the scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> genes in this assembly have similar 5′ domains, with a  <dig>  kb relative deletion 200 bp 5′ to the scampps- <dig> transcription start. the c. clementina chr <dig> assembly  <cit>  does not contain a scampps- <dig> gene, but has a scampps- <dig> gene at  <dig>  mb with a 5′ domain similar to the c. sinensis scampps- <dig> gene. the c. clementina chr <dig> assembly also contains a scampps- <dig> –related pseudogene at  <dig>  mb. to evaluate the extent of conservation between these two genes, pcr primers were designed corresponding to 5′ and 3′ sequences conserved on both scampps- <dig> genes as well as c. sinensis scampps- <dig>  these primers were used to amplify the genes from c. clementina genomic dna.

the primers were expected to amplify products with  <dig>  kb of 5′ and 250 bp of 3′ sequence in relation to the scampps- <dig> gene on the c. sinensis chr <dig> assembly. the sequences of two scamps- <dig> and three scampps- <dig> genes amplified from c. clementina were determined, as well as a scampps- <dig> gene amplified from the rootstock carrizo. the source of the 5′ identity of the scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> ests  is shown in figure  <dig>  in which the sequences of a scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> genomic pcr products are compared. the two pcr products  with a 5′ promoter element of 3109 bp share identical sequence from a position 6 bp 3′ to the intron  to a position − <dig>  kb relative to the transcription start. these two genes, which produce very different predicted cyclic products , therefore share the same  <dig>  kb proximal promoter sequence, as well as first exon and intron sequences. the two additional scampps- <dig> pcr products had a 5′ sequence of 3128 bp due to a short variable region  130 bp 5′ to the transcription start . upstream of this variable domain the promoter sequences for the scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> genes were essentially identical . the level of identity in the 5′ domains is consistent with the similar representation of scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> ests in the citrus phloem cdna library .figure  <dig> pcr amplification of scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> genes.  gscampps-3- <dig>   gscampps-4- <dig>  exon, coding and cyclic peptide regions are indicated as in figure  <dig>  the grey boxes indicate the variable domains . the black lines between the two sequences indicate the positions of single base pair differences.



the level of sequence identity among the scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> genes will clearly prevent accurate assembly of individual members from short sequencing reads. the c. sinensis genome assembly  <cit>  contains the intact gscampps-4- <dig> gene  as well as two linked partial gscampps-3- <dig> genes . the c. clementina assembly contains two scampps-4-related pseudogenes at  <dig>  mb  and  <dig>  mb on chr <dig>  both interrupted by repetitive dna sequences.

scampps genomic architecture
as shown in figure 6a,  <dig> of the  <dig> scampps-related c. clementina genomic loci are located in the first  <dig>  mb of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . within this region, the distribution of scampps is non-random, most are present as members of localized scampps gene clusters  <cit> . this genomic region is also rich in arrays of nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat protein  disease resistance gene arrays  <cit> , several of which are proximal to the scampps gene assemblies. the clearest example of this is shown in figure 6b. the region  <dig> - <dig>  mb contains  <dig> tandemly repeated rpp13-like  <cit>  nb-lrrp genes and  <dig> scampps genes. the duplications giving rise to this array resulted in duplication of a proximal scampps gene. figure 6c showed the chromosome  <dig> region  <dig> - <dig>  mb in which a scampps array is also flanked by duplicated nb-lrrp genes.figure  <dig> distribution of scampps, leucine-rich repeat proteins, genes and repetitive dna on citrus clementina chromosome  <dig>   positions 1– <dig>  mb of chr <dig>  scampps genes represented in the est database are indicated in green, those not so represented in red. lrrp genes and pseudogenes are indicated in green. other genes represented in the est database are indicated in green, those not so represented are in grey. ruler indicates position in mb.

identification of scampps- <dig> cyclic product by lc-ms
the scampps cyclic peptide products in figure  <dig> are assigned based on precursor protein similarity to previously identified cyclic products   <cit> . mass spectral analysis of c. clementina phloem proteins was employed to verify this assignment. the molecular ion  of the cyclic scampps- <dig> peptide gvpwaiaa, has a calculated monoisotopic mass of  <dig> . the lc-ms profile of the phloem extract was compared to synthetic cyclic scampps- <dig> product in the expected molecular mass range  . the equivalence of the synthetic scampps- <dig> and the cyclic product from the phloem was established by consistent hplc retention times and ms-ms hcd fragmentation of m/z  <dig>  .figure  <dig> lc-ms of scampps cyclic peptides. . hplc-ms chromatogram of synthetic peptide gvpwaiaa. upper trace is total ion current. lower traced is the extracted ion current profile for the molecular ion  of cyclic gvpwaiaa. . hplc-ms chromatogram of the fractionated phloem extract. upper trace is total ion current . lower trace is ion current profile for  <dig> - <dig>  m/z consistent with the molecular ion  of gvpwaiaa. peak at  <dig>  minutes is consistent with retention time of synthetic cyclic peptide gvpwaiaa.



the ms characterization of the scampps- <dig> chromatographic peak for both the synthetic peptide and the c. clementina phloem extract are shown in additional file  <dig>  the spectra averaged across the lc peak at the expected protonated cyclic peptide mass  also contains a separate, higher mass peak. the higher mass peak in the synthetic peptide sample  is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of the sodium adduct of the cyclic peptide . in contrast, the major peak in the phloem sample, measured as  <dig>  m/z  is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of the potassium adduct of the cyclic peptide. considering the lc conditions were the same in both cases, the relative intensity of the potassium adduct of the phloem sample compared to the synthetic sample indicates the source of the potassium, and therefore adduct, is the phloem. the relative difference in intensity is thought to be reflective of solution-phase binding  <cit> . ms-ms fragmentation of mass  <dig>  m/z revealed minimal fragmentation at the hcd relative collision energy of  <dig>  in contrast to significantly greater fragmentation observed for the non-adducted peptide, giving further evidence of stability of the molecule when complexed with potassium .

to date, no biological role has been assigned to any of the orbitides  <cit> . both the structure and cation binding properties of the scampps- <dig>  open the possibility that this cyclic peptide represents a k+ ionophore  <cit> . this interpretation is also consistent with the fragmentation pattern of the k+ adduct, resulting from the conformational changes expected in the k+ complexed relative to the uncomplexed form of the cyclic peptide  <cit> . while alkali metal ion adducts are commonly observed in electrospray, the potassium adduct is observed only in the plant-derived sample .

discussion
the biosynthesis of cyclic peptides occurs either through non-ribosomal pathways  <cit>  or processing of ribosomally synthesized precursors  <cit> . similar to citrus, the caryophyllaceae family members produce an array of 5– <dig> residue ribosomally synthesized small cyclic peptides derived from short precursor proteins  <cit> . characterization of cyclic peptide biosynthesis in saponaria vaccaria revealed the two-step processing of a precursor, involving an oligopeptidase cleavage of an amino terminal domain followed by an internal cyclization step resulting in removal of carboxy terminal residues  <cit> . with the exception of a conserved glycine residue at the amino terminal end of the cyclic peptide domain, the precursors for the saponaria vaccaria peptides and citrus scampps share no sequence similarity. however, the precursor structures suggest a similar biosynthetic pathway in citrus  <cit> .

previously, scampps gene products have been proposed to be defense-related based on transcriptional profiles  <cit> . this interpretation is supported both by the structure of the final peptide product  <cit>  and the chromosomal distribution of the scampps genes   <cit> . the evolutionary profile of the scampps genes, in particular hypervariability of the predicted cyclic peptide domain, is also consistent with a defensive role  <cit> .

the scampps composition, structure, expression, evolutionary profile and chromosomal distribution are consistent with designation as ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides   <cit> . scampps predicted cyclic products are generally amphiphilic in nature and charged scampps are almost exclusively positive , consistent with disruption of membrane permeability. the presence of the expected scampps- <dig> cyclic peptide in the phloem was confirmed by esi-ms. in addition, these analyses suggested a non-covalent scampps-4-potassium complex. relative binding efficiencies in non-covalent complexes, including polypeptide metal complexes, are known to be reflected in esi-ms analyses  <cit> . the data is therefore consistent with strong binding of potassium by scampps- <dig> peptide in phloem, and opens the possibility that this peptide acts as a carrier-type ionophore capable of transporting k+ cations across a membrane  <cit> .

the majority of the scampps loci identified on the c. sinensis and c. clementina genome assemblies are not annotated. this is not unexpected given the small size of the precursor product, the interruption of this small domain by an intron, and the rapid divergence of genes for ribosomally synthesized peptide products  <cit> .

while processing of the precursor to the cyclic product is unusual, the scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> genes also display an extraordinary evolutionary profile. the hypervariability of the 15–24 bp peptide domain  stands in contrast to the unexpected conservation of the  <dig>  kb upstream from the peptide region . while the scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> genes encode radically different final cyclic products, these genes share > <dig> % identity for the  <dig>  kb 5′ to the peptide. this hyper-conservation may in fact be related to the unusual transcriptional profiles of the scampps- <dig> and scampps- <dig> genes. they are equally represented in the phloem cdna library, each contributing >1% of the total transcripts. the maintenance of this level of transcription may preclude the expected accumulation of minor sequence changes .

CONCLUSIONS
we report here the description of the scampps gene family from citrus. the scampps predicted cyclic products have a number of properties that are consistent with designation as potential ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, including peptide structure, amino acid composition and potential cation binding properties. in addition, the expression patterns, evolutionary profile and chromosomal distribution of the genes encoding these peptides are consistent with this assignment in allowing evolutionary flexibility to respond to biotic challenges.
