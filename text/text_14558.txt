BACKGROUND
selenium has been reported to provide many health benefits in animals, including humans, when obtained from the diet in adequate amounts. for example, selenium has been known to play roles in cancer prevention, aging retardation, immune augmentation, prevention of heart diseases, muscle development and development . many of the health benefits of selenium are mediated by selenoproteins, which contain selenocysteine  as a selenium containing amino acid  <cit> .

selenophosphate synthetase  synthesizes selenophosphate , the active selenium donor in sec biosynthesis, using selenide and atp as substrates  <cit> . sep serves as a selenium donor during sec biosynthesis  <cit> . sec is contained in all selenoproteins  <cit> . sps was first isolated from escherichia coli as one of the enzymes involved in selenoprotein synthesis and was designated seld  <cit> . only one type of sps, seld, exists in lower eukaryotes and eubacteria, however, there are two isoforms of sps, sps <dig> and sps <dig>  that occur in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . one of the major differences in the sequences between sps <dig> and sps <dig> is that sps <dig> has an arginine at the position corresponding to sec in sps <dig>  <cit> .

although it is not clear why there are two spss in higher eukaryotes, recent studies have shown that sps <dig> synthesizes sep from selenide and atp in vitro, while sps <dig> does not have this activity  <cit> . loss of function in nih3t <dig> cells using rna interference technology showed that sps <dig> is required for selenoprotein biosynthesis, while sps <dig> does not affect the biosynthesis of this protein class  <cit> . while some insects such as the red beetle and silkworm have lost the selenoprotein synthesizing machinery including sps <dig>  sps <dig> is still encoded in the genome of these insects, suggesting sps <dig> is required for a function other than sep synthesis  <cit> .

although sps <dig> does not catalyze sep biosynthesis, it plays essential roles in the cell. when the gene encoding sps <dig>  was deleted in drosophila, the embryo showed lethality during development  <cit> , and reactive oxygen species  levels increased  <cit> . the haploinsufficiency of genes involved in the ras-regulated signaling pathway was also suppressed by sps <dig> knockout in drosophila  <cit> . from the finding that the seld  mutant of e. coli can be complemented by human sps <dig> only when l-sec is supplemented in the medium, it was suggested that sps <dig> is involved in the recycling of sec  <cit> . however, the means by which sps <dig> may be involved in sec recycling has not been determined. recently, it was found that the targeted depletion of sps <dig> by rna interference in drosophila sl <dig> cells causes growth inhibition, ros induction and megamitochondrial formation by increasing intracellular glutamine levels  <cit> . interestingly, human sps <dig> was found to interact with the soluble liver antigen, which was recently identified as eukaryotic sec synthase , and the binding reaction was enhanced by sec trna methylase designated secp <dig>  <cit> . it should be noted that secs is a pyridoxal phosphate -dependent enzyme and, therefore, the uptake and/or activation of vitamin b <dig> may be related to selenium metabolism  <cit> .

vitamin b <dig> is a water-soluble compound that contains a pyridine ring. vitamin b <dig> is present in nature as several different forms such as pyridoxal , pyridoxine , pyridoxamine  and their 5'-phosphorylated forms  <cit> . before use, these vitamers are converted to plp, which is the metabolically active form. plp is used as a cofactor for plp-dependent enzymes, where the pyridine ring acts as an electron sink during enzymatic reactions. since animals, including humans, cannot synthesize vitamin b <dig>  they must obtain it from their diet  <cit> . plp can be synthesized through several different pathways, and two types of enzymes, kinases and oxidases, participate in these pathways. for pm to be converted to plp, it is first phosphorylated by a kinase  to form pyridoxamine phosphate , and then the pmp is oxidized to form plp using an oxidase . pn can also be converted to plp using the same kinase and oxidase used for pm. in this case, the phosphorylated intermediate is pyridoxine phosphate . however, pl can be directly converted to plp by phosphorylation using a kinase  <cit> . therefore, kinases and oxidases are important enzymes for plp synthesis.

there are more than  <dig> plp-dependent enzymes in a cell that perform essential roles in various metabolic pathways including amino acid metabolism , fatty acid metabolism , and carbohydrate metabolism  . the plp-dependent enzymes that participate in amino acid metabolism can be classified into  <dig> categories: transaminase, racemase, decarboxylase and α,β-eliminase  <cit> . interestingly, the biosynthesis of sec can be mediated by cystathionine β-synthase  using serine as a precursor and it can also be synthesized by cystathionine γ-lyase  from selenocystathionine  <cit> . both cbs and cgl are plp-dependent enzymes  <cit> . in addition, enzymes that are involved in the degradation of sec, such as selenocysteine lyase , d-selenocystine α, and β-lyase, use plp as a cofactor  <cit> . recently, it was found that scl can interact with sps <dig>  <cit> . therefore, it seems that vitamin b <dig> participates in the metabolism of sec, i.e., in the biosynthesis and/or decomposition of sec.

in the present study, we found that the knockdown of sps <dig> led to the down regulation of genes involved in plp biosynthesis, which, in turn, induced the formation of megamitochondria and the expression of genes responsible for innate immunity. our findings suggest that sps <dig> primarily regulates plp biosynthesis, and the intracellular plp level affects various biological processes such as amino acid metabolism, megamitochondrial formation and innate immune response.

RESULTS
identification and temporal clustering of differentially expressed genes
after the addition of double stranded rnas targeting sps <dig> to the culture medium, total rnas were isolated on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after treatment and subjected to microarray analysis using affymetrix microchips . because megamitochondrial formation begins  <dig> days after knockdown  <cit> , transcriptomes were analyzed before and after megamitochondrial formation to find the primary target of sps <dig>  the knockdown efficiency was approximately 90% which was similar with that obtained in the previous work  <cit> . the log <dig> values of signal intensity of  <dig>  transcripts on each chip were obtained after normalization. by performing two-way anova analysis  against the log <dig> values of signal intensities of transcripts, a total of  <dig> genes were found to be different in their expression between knockdown and control cells. twenty-three genes were selected by model  <dig> and  <dig> genes by model  <dig>  with  <dig> genes being common between the two models .

to analyze the expression pattern of degs generated by sps <dig> knockdown, clustering of degs was performed according to their temporal expression using by self-organizing map  algorithms  <cit> . as a result, the degs were classified into  <dig> clusters . genes belonging to cluster  <dig>  showed continuous increase in their expression by sps <dig> knockdown, and most of them showed more than 4-fold increase on day  <dig>  the expression patterns of genes in cluster  <dig>  were similar to those of cluster  <dig>  but the average expression level was lower than that of cluster  <dig>  genes in cluster  <dig>  showed down-up patterns of expression. the expression of cluster  <dig> genes  was decreased until day  <dig>  and the expression level was maintained afterward. the expression pattern of genes in cluster  <dig>  was a down-down type. genes in cluster  <dig>  showed an expression pattern similar to that of cluster  <dig> genes. however, the average level of expression of cluster  <dig> genes was much lower than that of cluster  <dig> genes.

using six clusters resulted from above, the expression ratios of degs composing a cluster were drawn as a box plot according to their sampling date . as shown in figure 1c, the median values  of all clusters were close to zero on day  <dig>  however, q2s of clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on day  <dig> were significantly decreased. on day  <dig>  q2s of clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were significantly increased, while those of clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> decreased. the interquartile ranges  of each cluster were compared to select cluster whose iqrs were significantly deviated. clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> revealed significant down regulation compared to the other clusters on day  <dig>  the iqrs of those clusters on day  <dig> were lower than - <dig> . therefore, the threshold to select clusters whose expression was significantly changed at a specific sampling date was set to the absolute value of  <dig>  . a gene pool composing the selected clusters that showed the same expression pattern at the same sampling date was used as a gene-set for gene ontology analysis. as shown in figure 1c, there is no cluster showing that their iqrs were located at the outside of the threshold range  on day 1; thus, no gene was selected for go analysis from day  <dig> samples. however, on day  <dig>  the iqrs of clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were lower than the lower threshold , and the genes in these clusters were defined as the early/down gene-set because their expressions were decreased. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> showed a significant increase in their expression on day  <dig>  and the genes in those clusters were defined as the late/up gene-set. on the other hand, genes in clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed significant down-regulation in their expression, and they were defined as the late/down gene-set .

identification of statistically overrepresented biological processes by gene ontology analysis
to predict overrepresented metabolic pathway or biological process that is significantly affected by sps <dig> knockdown, gene ontology  analysis  <cit>  was performed with  <dig> gene-sets  previously defined using bingo software  <cit> . the parameters for statistical test and multiple testing correction were used to binomical test and bonferroni family-wise error rate  correction  <cit> , respectively. as a result, total  <dig> go biological process terms and  <dig> genes, which are included in each go term, were selected. . the terms related to vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis were selected as significant go terms from the early/down gene-set . changing the parameters for statistical tests and multiple testing corrections to benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate   <cit>  and hypergeometric test did not change the results , suggesting vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis is the only significant biological process affected by sps <dig> knockdown at the early stage. go terms selected from the late/up gene-set could be categorized into two distinct biological processes: defense  response and carboxylic acid  metabolism . both defense response  and carboxylic acid processes  were selected with significantly high probabilities. interestingly,  <dig> genes among  <dig> genes  selected from the late/up gene-set are known to participate in defense response. in addition,  <dig> of  <dig> defense response genes encode antimicrobial peptide . no go term was selected from the late/down gene-set. these results strongly suggest that sps <dig> affects vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis at the early stage and then defense response and amino acid metabolism through vitamin b <dig> activity.

validation of expression by quantitative pcr
since the cells that were not transfected with double stranded rna  as control for microarray analysis, it was necessary to confirm that the selected degs have the same expression pattern with the cells transfected with control dsrna. we used gfp dsrna as a control rna and quantitative pcr  was carried out to measure the expression levels. of  <dig> degs from the selected go terms ,  <dig> genes were arbitrarily chosen, and their expressions were compared between sps <dig> knockdown and gfp dsrna treated control cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  all tested genes showed the same pattern of expression as that obtained from microarrays. it should be addressed that all the genes involved in vitamin b <dig> synthesis and encoding amp were tested and showed the same expression patterns.

intracellular pyridoxal phosphate level was decreased by sps <dig> knockdown
because go analysis predicted that vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis was the only pathway affected at early stage by sps <dig> knockdown and the expression patterns of genes involved in vitamin b <dig> synthesis were confirmed, it can be speculated that levels of plp will decrease by sps <dig> knockdown. to test this hypothesis, intracellular plp levels were measured after sps <dig> knockdown. as shown in figure 3a, plp levels in the cells where sps <dig> was knocked down decreased by approximately twofold compared to the control cells. the plp concentration in sps <dig> knockdown cells was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/mg protein. on the other hand, the plp levels in the non-treated control and in gfp dsrna treated cells  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/mg protein, respectively. plp levels in sps <dig> knockdown cells were similar to those observed in 4-deoxypyridoxine , which is an inhibitor of plp biosynthesis, treated cells . these results indicate that the function of sps <dig> is to regulate the biosynthesis of plp in the cells.

inhibition of plp biosynthesis and sps <dig> knockdown showed similar expression patterns
because intracellular plp levels were significantly reduced after sps <dig> knockdown, it can be assumed that plp biosynthesis is the primary target of sps <dig>  and the inhibition of plp synthesis by treating cells with inhibitors will cause similar gene expression patterns as those resulting from sps <dig> knockdown. to test this hypothesis, drosophila cells were treated with 4-dpn for  <dig> days, and the expression level of genes selected by go analysis was measured with rt-pcr. as shown in figure 3b, the level of expression of the early/down genes  was not changed by 4-dpn treatment. because 4-dpn inhibits only the function of proteins that participate in plp synthesis and does not affect the expression of genes encoding those proteins, it is reasonable that 4-dpn does not affect the expression of cg <dig> and cg <dig>  however, the treatment of 4-dpn affected the expression of genes comprising the late/up and late/down gene-sets. of the  <dig> genes tested,  <dig> genes  showed expression patterns similar to those observed by microarray analysis. it should be noted that the late gene-sets include genes responsible for defense response and amino acid metabolism. these results strongly suggest that plp synthesis is the primary target of sps <dig> and that intracellular plp levels regulate other important biological processes such as defense system and amino acid metabolism.

the reduction of intracellular plp level inhibits cell growth and induces megamitochondrial formation
in our previous study, we discovered that sps <dig> knockdown leads to cell growth inhibition and induction of megamitochondrial formation  <cit> . as shown in figure 4a, cell growth was significantly inhibited after the cells were treated with 4-dpn suggesting that the cell growth retardation induced by sps <dig> knockdown was due to vitamin b <dig> starvation. another prominent phenotypic change induced by sps <dig> knockdown is megamitochondrial formation. drosophila sl <dig> cells were treated with 4-dpn for  <dig> days and examined under a confocal microscope after the mitochondria were stained with jc- <dig>  as shown in figure 4b, the cells treated with 4-dpn formed megamitochondria that were similar to those observed in the sps <dig> knockdown cells in terms of their size and number. interestingly, the number of polar mitochondria  in 4-dpn treated cells was similar to that in the control cells, and this mitochondrial polarity pattern was also similar to that observed in the sps <dig> knockdown cells. since megamitochondria formation can arise from several different pathways, we examined whether megamitochondrial formation occurred by the activation of gs <dig> and l <dig>  as shown in figure 4c, both the level of gs <dig> and l <dig> expression was increased. these results strongly suggest that the formation of megamitochondria, which is the most prominent phenotype from sps <dig> knockdown, is induced by the lack of intracellular plp.

discussion
we assumed that the genes whose expression was changed at the early stage after knockdown are involved in the primary target process regulated by sps <dig>  to identify the primary target, degs were isolated after microarray analysis and classified according to their temporal expression pattern; go terms of early changed degs were analyzed using bingo software. it is interesting that only plp biosynthesis was predicted from the early/down gene set, even though the parameters were changed. as shown in table  <dig>  the degs in the early/down gene set that are involved in vitamin b <dig> synthesis are cg <dig> and cg <dig>  cg <dig> is an ortholog of mammalian pyridoxine phosphate oxidase , which catalyzes plp production from pmp and pnp and pl production from pn or pm by oxidizing the substrates  <cit> . the function of cg <dig> was not determined experimentally. however, it has high homology with mammalian phosphoserine aminotransferase and pdxc of e. coli, which are responsible for producing 4-phospho-hydroxy threonine, a precursor of the pyridoxine ring  <cit> . therefore, it seems that cg <dig> plays a role in producing precursors of vitamin b <dig>  interestingly, intracellular plp levels were decreased even though only two genes among four genes that are involved in the plp biosynthesis pathway in drosophila cell were down-regulated . this result suggests that these two genes are involved in an essential step of plp biosynthesis, or sps <dig> may also regulate the other proteins involved in plp biosynthesis post-transcriptionally.

because plp is used as a cofactor for various enzymes that are important for many metabolic pathways, including amino acid metabolism, the inhibition of plp biosynthesis will lead to the inhibition of cell growth. the inhibition of cell growth induced by sps <dig> knockdown seems to be mediated by a decrease in intracellular plp levels. specific inhibition of plp synthesis by 4-dpn treatment led to growth inhibition , suggesting the growth inhibition by sps <dig> knockdown is caused by down-regulation of plp synthesis.

as described in the results, down-regulation of genes responsible for plp synthesis stimulated the expression of degs that participate in the defense response. in addition, most of the late gene-sets showed the same pattern of expression as that seen when cells were treated with 4-dpn . the relationship between vitamin b <dig> and cellular defense, however, has not been demonstrated before this study. previously, it was reported that the knockdown of sps <dig> induced diphthericin expression in drosophila sl <dig> cell when a genome-wide knockdown was performed  <cit> . the inhibition of plp synthesis also induced the expression of various amps, including dipththericin. therefore, sps <dig> plays a key role in innate immune responses, including amp production, by regulating plp level in the cell. the mechanism by which vitamin b <dig> regulates the innate immune system remains to be elucidated.

the fact that the treatment of 4-dpn, like sps <dig> knockdown, induced megamitochondrial formation indicates that intracellular glutamine levels increased with the inhibition of plp synthesis. because plp is used as a cofactor for enzymes that have transaminase activity, it is reasonable to assume that low levels of plp will lead to the inhibition of synthesis of amino acids such as glutamate or glutamine. however, the inhibition of plp biosynthesis induced the expression of gs <dig> and l <dig> . these two genes are involved in the increase of intracellular glutamine levels  <cit> . these results suggest that the lack of plp in the cell provides a signal for compensatory induction of some genes responsible for amino acid metabolism. plp regulation of the expression of gs <dig> and l <dig> has not been elucidated.

a model for the molecular pathways regulated by sps <dig> is summarized in figure  <dig>  sps <dig> regulates the intracellular level of plp by regulating the expression of genes responsible for plp biosynthesis. optimal levels of plp do not induce defense response signaling and glutamine synthesis. however, low levels of plp induce both defense signaling and glutamine synthesis. once defense signaling is stimulated, genes responsible for the innate immune system, including amps, are activated. the activation of genes responsible for glutamine synthesis leads to megamitochondrial formation. the low level of intracellular plp also leads to growth inhibition, presumably through induction of megamitochondrial formation and/or other biological processes. this hypothesis is supported by the observation of cell growth inhibition after the treatment of cells with 4-dpn . however, it is not clear whether the growth inhibition is caused by the induction of both glutamine and amp synthesis or one of these. in our previous study, it was found that conditions inducing megamitochondrial formation, such as the over expression of gs <dig> and l <dig>  also resulted in cell growth inhibition  <cit> . but there is no report showing that the condition for the induction of defense system inhibits cell growth. therefore, the inhibition of cell growth by amp induction is represented as a dotted line in figure  <dig> 

although sps <dig> was found to regulate the biosynthesis of vitamin b <dig>  the mechanism or signal pathway to which sps <dig> is related has not been determined. because sps <dig> is localized to both plasma and nuclear membranes  <cit> , it can be speculated that sps <dig> regulates signal transduction by transducing signals on the plasma membrane or by transporting messengers or transcription factors through the nuclear membrane. the treatment of cell with 4-dpn or sps <dig> knockdown induced the expression of pgrp-sd and toll- <dig>  which are involved in the toll signaling pathway, and pgrp-lf, which is an activator of the imd pathway . in addition, tamo, which is a negative regulator for nuclear import of dorsal, was found to be one of the down-regulated degs. these results strongly suggest that plp, which is regulated by sps <dig>  participates in both the toll and the imd pathways.

interestingly, sps <dig> knockdown induced down-regulation of cg <dig>  which encodes cystathionine β-synthase . cystathionine β-synthase catalyzes both l-cystathionine and l-selenocysteine synthesis  <cit> . therefore, it seems that sps <dig> regulates the synthesis of sec indirectly by regulating the expression of sec synthesizing enzymes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we predicted that vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis is the primary target of sps <dig> by employing bioinformatics methods such as microarray and go analyses and confirmed the prediction experimentally by showing that plp levels were decreased by sps <dig> knockdown and that the inhibition of plp biosynthesis caused the same phenotypes as sps <dig> knockdown.
