BACKGROUND
the grand challenges of the 21st century include fulfilling increasing demands for food, feedstock and chemical raw materials. as potential feedstock for renewable energy, the use of microbes that produce free fatty acid  has been strongly suggested . substantial efforts have been made to engineer escherichia coli  for ffa production . however, when e. coli produces ffa, it requires fixed carbon sources that are too costly to be exploited as feedstock. as an alternative, lignocellulosic biomass was also considered as a feedstock, however this process demands huge amounts of fresh water and farmland  <cit> . thus, photosynthetic cyanobacteria and microalgae that directly convert carbon dioxide into ffa are seen as more promising alternatives. in comparison to microalgae, cyanobacteria can be more easily genetically engineered because they have smaller and less complex genomes, and are often naturally competent for dna uptake  <cit> . moreover, cyanobacteria have the ability to excrete ffa that simplifies the biomass extraction process thereby reducing total cost by at least 70%  <cit> .

there are several aspects to consider when evaluating the potential of a cyanobacterial strain as a candidate chassis strain for ffa production in the context of biofuel production. some of these aspects include: 1/native biosynthetic capability for ffa production and excretion, 2/environmental robustness, 3/strain turnover rate, 4/the necessary gene expression levels, 5/metabolic fluxes, and 6/established genetic engineering tools. the primary aspect to consider is the strain’s natural potential to produce and excrete ffa, as when this potential is weak the strain would be considered as less useful. for simplicity in what follows we will refer to ‘ffa production and excretion’ as ‘ffa production’. in cyanobacteria, fatty acids are synthesized via the type ii fatty acid synthases . focal to fatty acids synthesis are acyl carrier protein  that covalently binds all fatty acyl intermediates during the synthesis process. fatty acid synthesis represents a central, conserved process by which acyl chains are produced and core enzymes required for fatty acids initiation and elongation are well characterized  <cit> . ffa production has been investigated in several cyanobacterial strains including synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> , synechocystis pcc  <dig>  <cit> , synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  <cit>  and arthrospira  platensis nise- <dig>  <cit> . of these cyanobacterial strains, the model system synechocystis pcc  <dig> has received the most research attention because of its ability to grow photoautrophically and heterotrophically. moreover, it was the first cyanobacterial genome to be completely sequenced  <cit> . current applications of cyanobacteria for sustainable production focus on utilizing different metabolic engineering strategies to maximize ffa production  <cit> . however, current engineered strains are not producing sufficient amounts of ffa to be commercially viable. to optimize overproduction of desired products such as fatty acids   <cit> ,  <dig> -butanediol   <cit> , succinate   <cit> , malonyl-coa   <cit> , acetyl-coa   <cit> , ethanol and isobutanol   <cit> , constraint-based strain optimization methods implemented in software packages such as optforce  <cit> , optknock  <cit> , optgene  <cit>  and cied  <cit>  have been used.

experimental evaluations  <cit>  suggest that not all cyanobacteria may be easily genetically engineered for efficient ffa/biofuel production  <cit> . genetic engineering efforts are further affected by the scarcity of available cyanobacterial strains, and the lengthy and costly cultivating and engineering processes. thus, only few cyanobacterial strains have been evaluated for ffa production, and it is highly likely that other natural strains could be a better chassis  <cit> . given the vastness of the bacterial diversity, it would be essential to have a computational method that can rapidly screen all potential strains for ffa production to help narrowing the scope of likely candidates for experimental genetic engineering. the steady accumulation of cyanobacterial genome data  provides an increasingly rich resource that can be used for this purpose in conjunction with available experimental data.

in this study we provide such an in silico screening method ffasc. ffasc estimates and ranks the potential of cyanobacterial strains for ffa production, and hence indirectly biofuel production, based on their predicted proteomes. ffasc has been established based on: 1/a compilation of protein orthologous groups  that impact ffa production; 2/a compilation of relevant assessment criteria; 3/the development of an algorithm that uses the criteria derived from ogs to rank candidate chassis strains based on their estimated potential to produce and excrete ffa. we used ffasc to screen and rank cyanobacterial proteomes for this purpose and indirectly screen their potential as candidates for cyanobacterial biofuel cell factories. the ffasc ranking for the top candidates is supported by their phylogenetic relationship, and by additional indirect in silico evidence. thus, our study suggests that ffasc allows selecting the most promising candidates for experimental validation, whereas the established selection criteria might provide useful insight for efficient metabolic engineering. moreover, although the methodology developed in our study is focused on ffa production, it can be applied in a similar way to other processes  as well as to other bacteria, fungi or plants.

RESULTS
establishing properties that are favorable for cyanobacterial ffa cell factory
the common procedures used to enhance the biotechnological production of ffa include the introduction of heterologous pathways, as well as the modification of the candidate cell factory metabolism via deletion of genes or enhancing gene expression. however, genetic engineering was not based on the consideration of the collective effects of different criteria that characterize a good cyanobacterial cell factory for ffa production, even though experimental outcomes have shown that not all cyanobacteria are suitable producers  <cit> . criteria that would potentially characterize the natural candidate cyanobacterial ffa cell factory include the presence of endogenous fa biosynthesis pathway enzymes  <cit> , as well as associated enzymes that have been modified and tested  to increase ffa production in organisms such as algae, cyanobacteria, yeast, e. coli and diatoms . through a literature search, we identified  <dig> proteins that are relevant for ffa production. we further classified these  <dig> proteins into  <dig> ogs , defined here as sets of proteins that are homologous with sufficient domains in common adequate to assume that they affect fa production similarly. to illustrate how these  <dig> ogs  affect ffa production, in fig.  <dig> we show the link of the  <dig> ogs with the associated metabolic pathways and links to processes associated with energy, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. although these  <dig> proteins cannot be considered complete, they represent the majority of engineering considerations. based on the results we obtained, it appears these proteins capture many of the relevant characteristics of the organism.table  <dig> list of  <dig> ogs relevant for ffa production

classification: nog  and pogs  during genetic engineering experiments on that organism in order to secretion, extraction, or accumulation fatty acid

in total, we identified  <dig> ogs  whose presence in the organisms negatively impacts ffa production. these proteins we collectively named nog . acyl-acp synthetase/long-chain-fatty-acid coa ligase  is an example of one of the cyanobacterial proteins from this group. kaczmarzyk and fulda  <cit>  demonstrated aas is capable of incorporating exogenous ffa from the culture medium into membrane lipids, an opposite process that reduces ffa production. aas is also responsible for recovering endogenous ffa released from membrane lipids. aas knockout mutants for synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  exhibited increased secretion of ffa into the culture medium compared to the wild-type strains  <cit> . the data suggests that the detected ffa is detached from membrane lipids, and also suggests that aas plays a role in recycling the released fa, explaining why the presence of the aas gene negatively impacts the efficiency of the candidate cell factory.

based on reported gene insertion and overexpression experiments, we also identified  <dig> ogs that contain proteins whose presence in the organisms positively impacts ffa production capability . thioesterase  is an example from this group. it was previously demonstrated that tesa cleaves the acyl-carrier-protein from the fa moiety, and in this manner increases fa biosynthesis in e. coli by reducing feedback inhibition  <cit> . thus, ruffing and jones  <cit>  cloned the e. coli-derived truncated thioesterase  and inserted it into the s. elongatus pcc  <dig> genome along with the aas knockout, thereby generating a mutant strain se <dig>  se <dig> produced a higher percentage of saturated ffa and a lower percentage of unsaturated ffa compared to the wild type  <cit> . thus, the presence of ‘tesa positively impacted the efficiency of the biofuel production. the remaining  <dig> ogs identified are required for fa production, but are not included in pog, and we named them rog . the difference between these two groups is that rogs are essential for ffa production, while pogs can be considered as ‘enhancers’.

based on these  <dig> ogs and their subgrouping to nog, pog and rog, we derived criteria for assessment of suitability of an organism for ffa production . in order to estimate an organism’s potential for ffa production, we used all of these derived criteria to generate an overall score that reflects ffa potential. for this purpose we developed ffasc. our optimization process through which we estimated the optimized weights of the criteria used, is based on two species, synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and arthrospira  platensis nise- <dig>  thus, our estimated weights are skewed and not optimal. however, they still provide better qualitative ranking of species for ffa production potential than in the case when all weights are assumed to be equal . these weights could be improved when more confirmed ffa-producing strains become available for this type of study.

screening cyanobacterial proteomes by ffasc
to evaluate the ffa production potential of the  <dig> cyanobacterial strains that have not been considered for ffa/biofuel production and the five cyanobacterial strains included in the reference dataset, the proteomes of all  <dig> cyanobacterial strains were screened using ffasc. the number of protein hits obtained from the sequence homology and domain search were used as an input to generate the og hit numbers associated with each og, and then applied to the derived set of criteria  to predict suitability of cyanobacterial strains for ffa production. the strains were ranked based on the sum of scores generated by all criteria. the higher the score, the better the rank .table  <dig> ranked list of cyanobacterial strains based on their ffa production potential score

even though a limited number of cyanobacterial strains have been engineered as ffa/biofuel producers, several trends can be identified. wild type synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  synechocystis pcc  <dig> and synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> are reported to produce approximately  <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig>   <cit>  mg/l of ffa, respectively. however, these criteria are generally not sufficient to identify the putative chassis strains. ruffing  <cit>  has demonstrated that synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> is a superior host strain compared to s. elongatus pcc  <dig> regarding biomass growth rate, environment tolerance, ffa tolerance and production. the ‘tesa-expressing aas-deficient mutants’ of synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  synechocystis pcc  <dig> and synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  showed an increase in ffa concentration of  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig>   <cit>  mg/l, respectively, indicating that the increase in ffa concentration depends on the favorable traits in each organisms overall genetic make-up. an additional genetic manipulation, that is, the overexpression of rubisco, in synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> further increased the ffa concentration to  <dig> mg/l. to-date the strain with the most genetic manipulations is synechocystis pcc  <dig>  which yields the highest ffa concentration of  <dig> mg/l. however, its genetic modifications include weakening of the cell wall layers that may affect survival capabilities under adverse conditions  <cit> . it was also demonstrated that while engineered s. elongatus pcc  <dig> strains successfully produce and secrete ffa, these cells are compromised with a decrease in chl-a content and photosynthetic yield, as well as changes in pigment localization that may be partially attributed to the unsaturated ffa being oxidized into toxic products  <cit> . such cell physiology associated ramifications are not known for engineered synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  however, engineered synechocystis pcc  <dig> were reported to mainly produce saturated ffa. these potential differences in the host metabolism suggest that synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> may be a better chassis strain for ffa production than s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  nonetheless, both synechocystis pcc  <dig> and s. elongatus pcc  <dig> are fresh water strains. on the other hand, marine strain synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> has been shown to endure salt concentrations up to  <dig> m  <cit> , making it an attractive target for large-scale production using marine water based media. synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> may also be the superior chassis strain, compared to both synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  owing to its short doubling time and remarkable light and temperature tolerance  <cit> . additionally, lyngbya sp. pcc  <dig> was shown to produce less ffa/biodiesel than s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  <cit> , while a. platensis nies. <dig> showed resistance to genetic manipulation  <cit> . thus, the positive reference chassis strains include synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> and synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> as they are easily genetically modified and show superior ffa production followed by s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  thus, lyngbya sp. pcc  <dig> and a. platensis nies. <dig> are considered in this study as negative reference hosts. due to the limited number of candidate cyanobacterial ffa producers. moreover, taking into account the reported outcomes for five cyanobacterial species included in our reference dataset, synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> is expected to perform better than both synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  followed by lyngbya sp. pcc  <dig> and a. platensis nies. <dig> 

the subsequent list of ranked cyanobacterial strains demonstrates that the positive reference strains rank above the negative reference strains. however, they are not the top ranked strains. the positive reference strains synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  ranked at position  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, while negative reference strains a. platensis nies. <dig> and lyngbya sp. pcc  <dig> ranked at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . thus,  <dig> cyanobacterial strains were ranked above the lowest ranked positive control reference strain at position  <dig>  of which  <dig> strains  ranked above all positive reference strains. all  <dig> top ranked strains are unicellular. we further observed that the reference strains were ranked as per experimental outcomes reported in the literature. additionally, weights assigned to criteria after optimization show that  <dig> of the  <dig> criteria have the greatest impact on the score and thus the ranking of the strains for ffa production potential . however, the criteria impact the score of every strain differently as this impact depends on the composition of the strain’s proteome. we point out that since we are interested in the organism’s natural potential to produce fa, we did not normalize the results for the genome size. we further provide heatmap visualization of the cyanobacteria screened for their potential as ffa producers against the  <dig> ogs . the heatmap shows that the majority of the top ranked strains  are placed in one major clade along with cyanobacterial positive reference strains, while the diatoms, used as an outgroup needed for hierarchical clustering, are placed in a clade of their own. also, the negative reference strains do not mix with the clade that contain the top ranked strains, that is, the heatmap shows a clear separation between these clades. moreover, the major clade that contains the top ranked strains generally has a higher number of pogs  and lower numbers of nogs , which contrasts with the clade in which negative reference strains are placed. taken together, the clade with top ranked strains displays more favorable traits for ffa production based on the  <dig> ogs assessed.table  <dig> weights assigned to rules after optimization that reflect the impact of these rules in the overall scoring

a more in depth assessment of the weights assigned to the  <dig> ogs  revealed that the medium ranked group  contains mostly the core enzymes of the general fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. these core enzymes are necessary for any producer strain, and their presence cannot be expected to distinguish weak from strong producers. by contrast, the top ranked group  contains two principal categories of enzymes: those ensuring precursor availability for biosynthesis of lipids and those involved in handling the oxidative stress associated to ffa synthesis. belonging to the first category are acetyl-coa carboxylase  <cit> , pyruvate kinase  <cit> , and acyl-acp synthetase/long-chain acyl-coa synthetase  <cit> . these key enzymes have been validated as metabolic engineering targets for increasing the flux of lipid production  <cit> , and it is not surprising that they have been ranked in the top group. recently, it was shown that the production of ffas in cyanobacteria entails the creation of high levels of reactive oxygen species  which causes oxidative stress, and ultimately loss of membrane integrity  <cit> . several enzymes identified in the top group provide relief from oxidative stress and/or are related to membrane permeability: glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and porin. under light, photosynthesis is known to induce the production of ros which cause lipid peroxidation  <cit> , and the activity of the above-mentioned enzymes can thus also ensure quality control of the produced lipids. a multifunctional lipase was also identified in the top group, coherent with the finding by  <cit>  that stimulating lipid catabolism is required to balance lipid accumulation with efficient growth. the composition of the top group therefore reflects the requirement for the producing cell to handle the flux control points  and to possess enzymes enhancing stress tolerance related to lipid accumulation . the weight values obtained during the optimization procedure thus reflect the importance of these two types of key markers for affecting the strain’s potential as cell factories that can be expected to reach a high titer of lipids.

comparison between ffasc and model seed
since, model seed  <cit>  automatically produces annotations and draft genome-scale metabolic models, we used it here to compare its results with the proposed ffasc approach using the ec numbers corresponding to the  <dig> ogs that affect ffa production. we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> ogs in ffasc can be used for a comparison with model seed, as it only focuses on enzymes required for metabolic model reconstruction. thus, the eight ogs omitted from this analysis include one enzyme that does not have a defined ec number such as ec  <dig> . <dig> -, while other ogs are proteins that do not function as enzymes. for the  <dig> ogs , we found model seed and ffasc have  <dig> identical og hits  for all  <dig> cyanobacterial strains screened . ffasc showed the presence of nine og hits  that were not present in model seed for some species. similarly, model seed showed the presence of four ogs  that were not found to be present using ffasc.fig.  <dig> a comparison of the binary  output for the  <dig> ogs produced by both model seed and ffasc. the length of the bar indicates the number of strains with the predicted og. the absence of bar means the ogs presence/absence for all  <dig> strains are identical in both methods




to analyze this data, we tabulated the engineered genes in model organisms synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> and s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  to show the set of genes known to be present in these organisms . liu et al.  <cit>  made six successive generations of genetic modifications for synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  these modifications include the knockout of slr <dig> and slr <dig>  which encode the cyanophycin synthetases  <cit> . this shows that slr <dig> and slr <dig> are known to be present in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  and is reported as present by ffasc, but absent in model seed. we further verified that rast  <cit>  correctly annotated both slr <dig> and slr <dig> in the synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> genome. however, it was omitted from model seed, due to the lack of gene-protein-reaction  association required for incorporation into seed models. for the four enzymes missing from ffasc, another modification made by liu et al. include the knockout of the slr <dig>  gene responsible for peptidoglycan layer assembly  <cit> . this shows once again that slr <dig> is known to be present in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  and is correctly found by both model seed and ffasc. however, we found that model seed identified slr <dig> in  <dig> additional cyanobacterial strains, whereas ffasc only identified slr <dig> in  <dig> additional cyanobacteria screened. we found ffasc filtered out the other slr <dig> hits as a consequence of the stringent protein-domain condition applied to increase the accuracy underlying ffasc predictions, that is, only homologous protein sequences that have all domains of the associated protein from the group of  <dig> proteins were recorded as og hits. moreover, all the core enzymes of the general fatty acid biosynthesis pathway were identified using ffasc, whereas model seed did not identify fabz due to the lack of gpr association required for incorporation into seed models. here, the differences between model seed and ffasc are a consequence of: 1/model seed is a generic method in which all pathways are treated equally, whereas ffasc is specialized and focuses on ffa production and is built based on proteins known to either positively or negatively affect ffa production; 2/model seed provides the presence or absence of the enzymes, whereas ffasc takes the copy number into account when assessing potential for ffa production; and 3/ffasc include all proteins  that directly or indirectly affect ffa production. taken together, ffasc is more refined in assessing the “natural” cyanobacterial strains potential for ffa production, whereas model seed was developed for a more generic purpose.

additional in silico support for estimated ffa production potential of cyanobacteria
to provide additional support that the predictions obtained by ffasc are reasonable, we used k-means clustering  <cit>  based on the same  <dig> criteria. to cluster the  <dig> target species into k clusters, where distance of species within a single cluster is minimized and distance between clusters or cluster centers is maximized, a value for k has to be set in away that reflects the natural groupings. that is, if k is too small, the clustering algorithms will reduce the total number of groups to the specified value of k, which forces some natural clusters to combine, thereby producing artificial fusions  <cit> . likewise, if the value of k is too large, natural clusters will start dividing in an artificial way, to match the specified k value.

to determine the appropriate number of clusters, we take into account that diatoms are eukaryotes and thus act as a type of outlier. when they fall into the same cluster this would indicate the point at which the artificial grouping is omitted  <cit> . thus, the clustering will be considered good when diatoms fall into a separate cluster. the number of clusters where diatoms start to group together is k =  <dig> and k =  <dig>  the point at which diatoms start to separate is when the number of clusters is k =  <dig>  additionally, using an average silhouette width as the measure of ‘natural’ clustering  <cit> , we found that when considering k =  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  the highest average silhouette width of  <dig>   was associated with k =  <dig>  to further verify the appropriate number of clusters, we also calculated the calinski-harabasz  index for k =  <dig> , k =  <dig>  and k =  <dig>  . ch index results verify that k =  <dig> is the appropriate cluster number. a visual illustration of the case k =  <dig>  shows that cluster  <dig> is the most distant from the other clusters. this cluster includes the  <dig> diatoms alone as the outliers, while the negative reference host lyngbya sp. pcc  <dig> and a. platensis nies. <dig> were placed in cluster  <dig>  top ranked strains, above synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  were all placed in cluster  <dig>  moreover, all positive reference chassis strains; synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and s. elongatus pcc  <dig> were grouped together in cluster  <dig>  additionally, all strains that ranked below synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> but above s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  were either placed in cluster  <dig> or  <dig>  the placement of cluster  <dig> was closest to cluster 6; these clusters slightly overlap one another, but are separate from the other clusters. this indicates that even though k-means clustering does not rank strains, it is still able to discern the potential ffa producers identified with ffasc by clustering them primarily in cluster  <dig> based on the og criteria.fig.  <dig> silhouette plot for clustering quality shows the average silhouette value for clustering  <dig> species into  <dig> clusters. a silhouette index ranges from - <dig> to  <dig> and a value greater than  <dig> and closer to  <dig> indicates that points are in the appropriate cluster

additionally, we note that the three diatoms used in this study are taxonomically distinct , while the  <dig> cyanobacterial strains are classified under only seven orders, namely chroococcales, gloeobacterales, nostocales, oscillatoriales, pleurocapsales, prochlorales and stigonematales . only strains of the order chroococcales and prochlorales are found in cluster  <dig>  which seems to contain the best candidates. strains of the order chroococcales are commonly found in five of the six clusters; however, strains of the order prochlorales were only found in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> that include the positive reference strains and top ranked strains. this suggests that prochlorales species may be potentially good ffa producers.table  <dig> the analyzed strains classified under their associated order names allocated to the six clusters




phylogenetic relationships of cyanobacteria
we explored phylogenetic groupings of  <dig> cyanobacterial strains used in this study. we found that several of our top ranked candidate cyanobacterial strains are grouped together based on their 16s rrna. some exceptions include two thermosynechococcus sp., two synechococcus sp. ja* and candidatus atelocyanobacterium thalassa  .fig.  <dig> maximum-likelihood based phylogenetic tree of  <dig> cyanobacteria and the outgroup using 16s rrna with bootstrap support. the branches and taxa name for positive reference strains are colored in green and for negative reference strains are colored in red, while the top predicted ranked strains are colored in blue 




this result is supported by literature, since the top ranked cyanobacterial strains primarily include prochlorococcus  and marine synechococcus , which are reported to have diverged from common ancestry  <cit> . following the divergence, the prochlorococcus genome is further thought to have ‘streamlined’  <cit> , thus, the genome size of synechococcus and other cyanobacteria is larger than prochlorococcus genome sizes  <cit> . another key feature that differentiates prochlorococcus from synechococcus is their divergent light-harvesting strategies  <cit> : synechococcus uses the phycobilisome as their light-harvesting antenna that are not found in prochlorococcus. these phycobilisome antenna systems are used by synechococcus to adjust to changes in temperature, likely contributing to its greater geographical occupancy range  <cit> . instead, the prochlorococcus main light-harvesting antenna complex is made up of divinyl chlorophyll a and b, prochlorophyte chlorophyll-binding protein , as well as accessory pigment  <cit> . collectively, these pigments increase blue light absorption that is the dominant wavelength in deep waters, restricting prochlorococcus to warmer, oligotrophic oceans  <cit> . since prochlorococcus is reported to be a leading example of a naturally 'streamlined' genome  <cit> , this suggests that these genomes may require less engineering to efficiently produce high yields of ffa. moreover, prochlorococcus can be inexpensively cultivated using seawater  <cit> .

reference strains of the order chroococcales, including synechococcus pcc  <dig>  synechocystis pcc  <dig> and s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  were engineered, and demonstrate the production and secretion of ffa, which provides proof-of-concept. however, none of the predicted top ranked strains of the order chroococcales has been shown to produce ffa. nonetheless, synechococcus utex  <dig> , has recently been reported to be a fast growing chassis strain for biosynthesis using light and carbon dioxide, growing two times faster than s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  <cit> . this finding demonstrates that there are possibly more suitable chassis strains that have not been investigated. moreover, the chisholm group  <cit>  have reported that the prochlorococcus strain mit <dig> produces lipid-containing vesicles that are released into the surrounding seawater. these released lipid-containing vesicles maybe collected without disturbing the growth of the prochlorococcus, as opposed to other cyanobacteria or algae that require destroying one batch of cells and starting with a new batch, to retrieve lipids. ffasc ranked the prochlorococcus strain mit <dig> at position  <dig>  suggesting that if the mit <dig> mechanism is a prochlorococcal trait, there are several other possible vesicle-releasing prochlorococcus strains that may be a better chassis for ffa production. moreover, the fact that the candidate chassis strains are clustered primarily in orders synechococcus and prochlorococcus, is a welcomed surprise that could constitute an additional criterion for positive prediction.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we developed ffasc, a first screening method that ranks the potential of candidate cyanobacteria for ffa production and excretion based on favorable/non-favorable genetic characteristics. ranking the candidate species enables narrowing the experimental focus on more likely candidates for good ffa producers. thus ffasc might prove a useful tool in highlighting candidate strains for industrial-scale biofuel production . the outcome of this analysis suggests unicellular cyanobacterial species such as prochlorococcus marinus, candidatus atelocyanobacterium thalassa , synechococcus sp. cb <dig>  synechococcus sp. rs <dig>  thermosynechococcus elongates bp- <dig>  synechococcus sp. wh  <dig>  synechococcus sp. wh  <dig>  thermosynechococcus sp. nk <dig>  synechococcus sp. ja-3-3ab and synechococcus sp. cb <dig>  as potentially favorable chassis ffa producers. it would also be reasonable to consider other strains with a phylogenetic closeness to the above strains as potential ffa producers as well. moreover, the methodology developed can be adopted for other metabolic production, and for other species.

we plan to follow-up this research by: 1/expanding the orthologous group to other cyanobacterial genes that are closely related to ffa production such as co2-fixation, photosynthesis, cell division, environment tolerance genes and 2/develop the ffasc database to classify and evaluate the ffa production potential of cyanobacterial strains based on their proteomes.
