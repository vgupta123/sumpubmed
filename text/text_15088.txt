BACKGROUND
the transition from high levels of outcrossing  to predominantly self-fertilization  represents a dramatic evolutionary change in the reproductive biology of many angiosperms  <cit> . the allocation of resources in floral anatomy was profoundly altered with the shift to ‘selfing’: compared to their allogamous counterparts, autogamous flowers tend to produce less pollen, scent and nectar, have a shorter distance between receptive stigma and dehiscent anthers, and have smaller petals that open less at maturity  <cit> . one explanation for the shift to selfing is the evolutionary advantage that would accrue to selfing individuals over outcrossers when pollinators or mating partners are scarce, generally referred to as ‘reproductive assurance’  <cit> . in some mixed mating systems, the production of cleistogamous flowers  is promoted in stressed environments  <cit> . earlier studies also have shown that the application of plant hormones that mimic sustained growth conditions ) encourages the production of chasmogamous flowers  <cit> , while the application of hormones that mimic water stress ) promotes cleistogamy  <cit> . these findings draw attention to internal signaling pathways that may have been key instruments in the evolution of selfing through their dual role in environmental stress response and flower development. methyl jasmonate  and other members of the jasmonate family of compounds , represent a major group of plant hormones that could play such a role, as the importance of ja in mediating plant responses to abiotic and biotic stimuli, as well as its contribution to different aspects of flower development, is well established .

the role of ja in flower development has been correlated primarily with male fertility, as most arabidopsis ja-biosynthesis and ja-signaling mutants show defects in stamen development  <cit> . however, components of ja biosynthesis and signaling can affect other aspects of reproductive development in plant species. for instance, mutations in coronatine insensitive  <dig> , an integral component of ja perception in arabidopsis, results in male sterility, while mutations in the coi <dig> homolog in tomato results in female sterility due to defects in the maternal control of seed maturation  <cit> . in addition, arabidopsis ja-biosynthesis mutants such as opda reductase  <dig>  and allene oxide synthase  are male sterile due to inviable pollen or insufficient filament elongation  <cit> ; whereas the inhibition of ja production in maize ja-biosynthesis mutants tasselseed  <dig> , opr <dig> and opr <dig> has negative impacts on male sex determination, as staminates are converted to pistillate flowers in these mutants  <cit> . in rice, defects in ja biosynthesis or perception proteins leads to altered spikelet morphology; floral organ identity and number  <cit> ; flower opening and closure; as well as anther dehiscence  <cit> . these mutant phenotypes demonstrate that ja biosynthesis and signaling elements are necessary for proper flower development but that the roles of ja elements have diversified during the evolution of flowering plants.

positive and negative feedback loops regulating ja production and function are primarily coordinated through the degradation and synthesis/stabilization of ja suppressor proteins, collectively known as jasmonate zim-domain  proteins. the degradation of jaz proteins is mediated by the f-box protein coi <dig>  which associates with other partners  of e <dig> ubiquitin ligase to form scfcoi <dig>  <cit> . upon perception of the ja signal, scfcoi <dig> targets jaz proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26s proteasome  <cit> . the interaction between jaz and coi <dig> constitutes the co-receptor complex required for the perception of the bioactive hormone, ja-isoleucine   <cit> . the degradation of jaz proteins unblocks the activity of transcription factors responsible for anthocyanin biosynthesis and trichome initiation   <cit> ; stamen development   <cit> ; resistance to herbivores   <cit>  and resistance to necrotrophic fungi   <cit> . as a negative feedback mechanism, jaz genes are transcriptionally upregulated in response to high levels of ja  <cit> . among these genes, alternative splice variants  are immune to degradation and repress the ja pathway in the presence of hormone  <cit> . although the general role of jaz proteins during flower development can be anticipated based on their inhibition of the ja signal transduction pathway, the diverse phenotypes associated with ja-insensitivity in different plant species suggest species-specific functions for jaz proteins.

in this study, we used peach  varieties producing either showy or non-showy flowers in order to investigate the role of ja pathway components in floral display. unlike other stone fruits, such as plums, cherries and apricots, which all require cross-pollination in order to achieve fruit set, most peach varieties are self-fertile  <cit> . therefore, these peach varieties, with their distinct flower appearance, present a good model to study ja and jaz roles in petal morphology, independent of the role ja plays in male or female fertility. our results show that a member of the jaz family, ppjaz <dig>  regulates flower development through controlling petal elongation and flower opening, a previously uncharacterized role for the jaz proteins.

RESULTS
showy versus non-showy peach flowers
to elucidate the molecular basis of flower opening and selfing in peach, we examined two varieties with showy flowers  and two varieties with non-showy flowers  . there were only minor differences among the genotypes in terms of stamen and pistil lengths during various stages of flower development. in contrast, clear differences were found among varieties in terms of petal surface area and the timing of anther dehiscence. petal surface area was significantly different  between the showy and non-showy flowers, particularly after stage iii . cell size measurements indicated that reduced petal growth of the non-showy flowers is due to reduced cell expansion . dehiscent anthers were observed as early as stage iii for the non-showy flowers, and not until stage iv in the showy varieties . up to 40% of anthers dehisced in ‘glowing star’ and ‘v85331’ in closed buds , whereas in ‘vabm29’ and ‘bounty’ no more than 5% of anthers dehisced at stage iv, before the number dramatically jumped to 100% at anthesis  . applying conventional botanical nomenclature, the non-showy genotypes were thus considered to be pre-anthesis cleistogamous  while the showy genotypes were considered chasmogamous .figure  <dig> 
different patterns of flower opening, petal growth and anther dehiscence among peach varieties.  four peach varieties were used in this study as representatives for showy, ‘vabm29’ and ‘bounty’, and non-showy, ‘glowing star’ and ‘v85331’ flowers. flowers and flower buds were collected in five stages based on the development of outer and inner floral organs, scale bar = 20 mm.  anther dehiscence and pollen release were monitored in stage iii of flower development. micrographs show closed flowers with three petals removed from each flower to show the development of stamen, scale bar = 6 mm. petal growth, represented as petal surface area  and anther dehiscence   were recorded for the four peach varieties during four stages of flower development .



ja-dependent regulation of floral display in peach
to examine whether the observed differences among peach genotypes can be explained by changes in jasmonates biosynthesis levels, the endogenous levels of ja and ja-ile were quantified in petals of ‘vabm29’ and ‘glowing star’ at stage ii  and stage v . given the potential role of stamens as a source of ja  <cit> , the selection of these two stages  was meant to avoid any residual effect the non-dehiscent stamens might have on the level of ja and ja-ile in petals. as shown in figure 2a, b, both ja and ja-ile were significantly more abundant in petals of ‘glowing star’ at both developmental stages. while the levels of ja and ja-ile declined significantly in ‘vabm29’ at stage v, no differences were noticed between the two developmental stages in ‘glowing star’ . interestingly, the expression levels of two ja biosynthesis genes, ppopr <dig> and pplox <dig>  encoding for opda-reductase  <dig> and lipoxygenase  <dig> , respectively, did not follow the same pattern of ja and ja-ile levels in petals. although the expression of both genes was significantly higher in pcl varieties at stage ii, transcript levels declined almost equally in all varieties at anthesis  . these results parallel a recently published report concerning the regulation of ja pools during the development of coyote tobacco  flowers, in which the authors demonstrated that transcriptional activation of ja-biosynthesis genes precedes rapid flower maturation and accumulation of ja-ile  <cit> .figure  <dig>

these results together indicate that increased ja concentration in flower buds may inhibit full petal growth, a hypothesis partially supported by the application of meja  to stage ii flowers of ‘glowing star’ . meja treatment accelerated petal growth during the first 48 hours, but growth ceased 72 hours after treatment and most flowers failed to open. by contrast, petals of water-treated flowers expanded only slightly during the first 48 hours, but increased dramatically in size by 72 hours post-treatment, with an average increase of 3 mm <dig> more than the meja-treated flowers . such differences in petal growth rate were accompanied by variations in the percentage of dehisced anthers, which significantly increased  after  <dig> and 48 hours of meja treatment compared to water treatment . the application of meja to vabm <dig> did not, however, affect the ratio of anther dehiscence or the petal surface area compared to water treatment , suggesting that differences among pcl and ch varieties cannot be explained by components of the ja biosynthesis pathway only.

the expression profile of peach jaz genes
to gain insight into the role of ja signaling components in the regulation of pcl versus ch phenotypes of peach flowers, nine jaz genes were isolated from a peach cdna library and their expression levels were monitored during the transition of flowers from the bud stage to anthesis. peach jaz proteins  contained the characteristic zim domain and jas motif that are necessary for most jaz functions . based on the conserved motifs and on phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood bootstrap method, the nine identified peach jaz proteins were assigned to seven classes . transcript levels of five peach jaz genes  followed the same pattern as ja-biosynthesis genes ppopr <dig> and pplox <dig> in flower petals, wherein transcripts were significantly more abundant in pcl compared to ch varieties at stage ii and then declined dramatically in all varieties at stage v . meanwhile, three jaz genes  had constant expression levels before and after flower opening . ppjaz <dig> was the only jaz member showing higher expression in stage v than in stage ii and in pcl compared to ch varieties , which strongly suggests a distinct role for this gene during anthesis. the promoter region  of ppjaz <dig> was isolated from genomic libraries of ‘vabm29’, ‘bounty’, ‘glowing star’ and ‘v85331’. the promoter regions contained a number of predicted binding sites for transcription factors with demonstrated roles in floral pigmentation , petal growth  and floral development  . it is also worth noting that one of the cis-regulatory elements that is present in the promoter of ppjaz <dig> is the binding site for the floral homeotic protein, agamous, which interferes with ja biosynthesis during late stages of stamen development through its binding to the promoter of the defective in anther dehiscence <dig> , a catalytic enzyme of ja  <cit> . although all the above-mentioned cis-acting elements exist in pcl and ch varieties, a single nucleotide polymorphism  was detected in the binding site of aintegumenta transcription factor, which is involved in regulation of cell division and organ size  <cit> . interestingly, this snp is present in the sequence retrieved from ‘vamb29’ which has the largest showy flower among all the studied varieties. further investigations on the role of these cis- and trans-acting elements on the expression of ppjaz <dig> are likely to unravel additional molecular elements in ja signaling and action during flower development.figure  <dig>

ppjaz <dig>  a cleistogamy-inducing gene
to test the functionality of ppjaz <dig> in the regulation of the non-showy appearance, we expressed the open reading frame  of ppjaz <dig> in tobacco , which carries typical showy ch flowers. it is worth noting that genetic transformation of peach is still in its infancy and it would take decades to generate stable transgenic trees. on the other hand, the tobacco transformation procedure is well established and transgenic plants/seeds can be relatively easily obtained. three transgenic tobacco lines , selected from several independent transformation events at t <dig> , were selfed successively to generate t <dig> and t <dig> seeds. the segregation of t <dig> seeds on the selection medium did not follow the expected 3: <dig> mendelian segregation, which along with the numerous floral phenotypes obtained in subsequent generations points to multiple transgene insertions. the level of ppjaz <dig> transgene, flower morphology parameters and other molecular investigations were done on t <dig> plants. compared to the wild type , flowers of transgenic plants showed different levels of petal pigmentation, size, flower opening and even fertility. in the cl <dig> group, flowers lacked pigmentation, becoming whitish rather than rose-pink, but flower size and opening were little affected compared to wt . in addition to the loss of petal pigmentation, flowers of the cl <dig> and cl <dig> groups were partially or completely closed , showed defects in stamen morphology  or exhibited short stamen filaments combined with defects in flower opening  . the level of ppjaz <dig> transgene expression exhibited a near perfect correlation with defects in petal pigmentation and petal size of the same transgenic group . in the  <dig> transgenic plants studied, the correlation between the level of ppjaz <dig> transgene and plant height or leaf width was weak . however, the level of transgene was negatively correlated  with petal, stamen and pistil lengths, respectively , collectively indicating that ppjaz <dig> mainly affects floral morphology but not vegetative growth. moreover, fruit set was not affected in most transgenic plants, even in the completely closed flowers  . it can be thus summarized that ppjaz <dig> promotes self-fertilization in closed flower buds, which is effectively an induced cleistogamy.figure  <dig>

 three t <dig> transgenic tobacco plants were identified and selected from independent transformation events. while cl <dig> did not show any major differences compared to wt except for having less corolla pigmentation, cl <dig> and cl <dig> plants were partially or completely closed, respectively.  the expression of ppjaz <dig> transgene in transgenic lines was quantified relative to that of ntactin. wt, wild type.
t <dig> transgenic tobacco plants showed diverse patterns of flower opening.  compared to wt tobacco flowers, flowers of transgenic tobacco plants had less corolla coloration, less petal elongation at anthesis, showed typical cleistogamy phenotype or had impaired flower buds. flowers were collected from t <dig> tobacco plants at the anthesis stage or shortly after anther dehiscence for those flowers that did not open. flowers from each transgenic group were arranged in three panels representing three groups of transgenic lines  generated from three independent t <dig> plants. inside each group the lines were arranged in the same way present in the x-axis of graph b.  the level of ppjaz <dig> transgene was quantified in leaves of each transgenic line using the qrt-pcr approach. the gene expression in each line was normalized to that of ntactin and was calculated relative to the gene expression of a reference sample . the results represent the mean ± se of three replicates prepared from different leaves of the same plant.  scatter plot matrix generated based on the data recorded for  <dig> transgenic and three wt tobacco plants. r is calculated using pearson correlation coefficient. wt, wild type.
cleistogamous tobacco flowers set fruits as normal as the wild-type flowers. while wild-type plants do not show any fruits in the closed-bud stage or in the recently fertilized flowers as indicated by the red arrows , ppjaz <dig> tobacco from cl <dig> a produced only cleistogamous flowers and set fruits as indicated by the blue arrows , confirming the self-fertility nature of these flowers.



features of ja-insensitivity in transgenic plants
inhibition of root growth is a well-defined physiological effect of ja and has been used in many forward genetic screens to discover ja-insensitive mutants  <cit> . to examine whether the phenotypic variations between flowers of wt and transgenic lines are due to ja-insensitivity, the effects of ja on root growth were investigated. while root length of wt and transgenic plants was similar on meja-free medium, significant inhibition of root growth was observed for both wt and cl <dig> h seedlings on medium containing meja  . for cl <dig> g and cl <dig> a, which express high levels of ppjaz <dig> transgene, less inhibition of roots in meja-containing medium was recorded . this effect was even more pronounced with prolonged exposure  to high concentrations of meja : although wt and cl <dig> h plants barely grew, cl <dig> g and cl <dig> a plants developed healthy roots and shoots in high-meja medium .figure  <dig> 
ja insensitivity of tobacco plants expressing ppjaz <dig>   seeds from wt, cl <dig> h, cl <dig> g and cl <dig> a were grown on ms agar without  and with 25 μm meja  for 4 days at 4°c and then for 12 days at 25°c. the growth of cl <dig> g and cl <dig> a roots was less inhibited by meja  compared to wt e and cl <dig> h.  values of root lengths are the means of three replicates  with se. genotypes marked with asterisk  are significantly higher than wt e, according to tukey-kramer hsd .  the effect of long-term exposure to ja on root length was examined by growing the seeds on ms medium supplied with meja  for 40 days. transgenic plants from cl <dig> g and cl <dig> a continued to grow on meja containing medium and produced normal roots and shoots, indicating their insensitivity to meja, while wt and cl <dig> h showed susceptibility to meja treatment. hsd, honest significant difference; ja, jasmonic acid; meja, methyl jasmonate; wt, wild type.



activation of ja-biosynthesis genes in plants has repeatedly been reported in response to herbivorous insect attack  <cit> . mechanical wounding is mostly used to mimic feeding by herbivores, especially generalists. in order to investigate ja sensitivity in ppjaz <dig> transgenic tobacco plants, the induction kinetics of tobacco ntlox <dig>  ntopr <dig> and ntaoc genes, encoding essential enzymes for ja biosynthesis, were monitored in wt and cl <dig> a leaves at  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and 6 hours of mechanical wounding. expression of all genes was significantly lower  in untreated-cl3a plants  compared to untreated-wt plants. after wounding, the three genes showed similar induction kinetics in both genotypes, but expression levels were significantly higher in wt compared to cl <dig> a . for instance, ntaoc transcript abundance increased 41-fold in wt leaves within one hour of wounding, whereas cl <dig> a-wounded leaves showed only a four-fold increase in ntaoc transcripts, compared to the control . these results along with the root inhibition assay indicate that ppjaz <dig> transgenic tobacco plants show clear features of ja-insensitivity.figure  <dig>

differential regulation of ja-related genes in leaves and petals
ja biosynthesis genes are regulated by a positive feedback mechanism, meaning that ja itself can induce the expression of its biosynthetic genes  <cit> . the induction of ja biosynthesis genes does not necessarily require de novo synthesis of transcriptional activators but rather involves the removal of potential suppressors, that is, jaz proteins  <cit> . although this might explain the significantly low level of ja-biosynthesis genes in wounded and non-wounded cl <dig> a, it cannot explain the fertility of these plants which is also a ja-dependent trait. these data had led us to hypothesize that ja biosynthesis downstream of ppjaz <dig> might be differentially regulated in leaves and flowers. to examine this notion, the expression of ntaoc, ntlox <dig>  and ntopr <dig> were studied in leaves and flower petals of  <dig> transgenic and three wt tobacco plants. myc <dig>  arf <dig> and myb <dig> are known positive regulators for the ja biosynthesis pathway and flower opening  <cit> . genes encoding these proteins  were also investigated in wt and transgenic plants. the results of gene expression analyses are presented in table  <dig> and additional file 6: tables s <dig>  s <dig> and can be summarized in three main points: 1) the expression of ja biosynthesis genes is asymmetrically associated with their transcription activators. while the expression of ntaoc was positively correlated with that of ntarf <dig>  both in leaves and petals, respectively, the expression of ntlox <dig> was highly correlated with that of ntmyc2a or ntmyc2b  in both leaves and petals. the expression of ntopr <dig> had minimal correlation with any of the studied transcription factors. 2) although the expression of ntaoc was negatively correlated with the level of ppjaz <dig> transgene in leaves , the expression of these genes was positively correlated in petals , and so were ntarf <dig> and ppjaz <dig>  on the other hand, the expression of ntlox <dig> and its associated genes, ntmyc2a and 2b, was negatively correlated with the expression of the transgene both in leaves and petals. 3) ntmyb <dig> did not show any detectable expression in leaves, but was detected in petals. the expression of this gene in petals was negatively correlated with that of ppjaz <dig> , which is in agreement with the proven role of this gene in flower opening  <cit> . these results strongly support our argument that ja-biosynthesis downstream of ppjaz <dig> is divergent in leaves and petals, the implications of which are discussed below.table  <dig>

ja-insensitivity due to ppjaz <dig> stability
the ja-insensitivity observed in transgenic tobacco plants along with the inability of ja treatment to rescue the cl phenotype in cl <dig> a , suggests that ppjaz <dig> is a highly stable jaz protein. we confirmed this by investigating arabidopsis roots expressing ppjaz1-gfp and those expressing atjaz1-gfp after  <dig>   <dig> and 60 minutes of meja  treatment. fluorescence intensity of atjaz1-gfp chimeric protein decreased substantially within 10 minutes of meja treatment and disappeared altogether after 30 minutes, indicative of complete degradation of atjaz <dig> , in agreement with previous results  <cit> . by contrast, ppjaz1-gfp fluorescence remained unchanged after  <dig>   <dig> and 60 minutes of meja treatment . the stability of ppjaz <dig> was further confirmed in its native cellular environment by transiently expressing ppjaz1-gfp chimeric protein in peach leaves . although ppjaz <dig> is localized in the cell nucleus, the close-up view indicates the existence of nuclear protein bodies  . the formation of npbs has been reported for other signaling molecules as well  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the stability of jaz proteins was demonstrated previously for natural splice-variants that lack the jas motif or when the jas motif is purposely removed from the complete protein  <cit> . in both cases, the absence of the jas domain hindered the interaction of jaz proteins with coi <dig>  which targets these proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin/26s proteasome pathway. the interaction between jaz proteins and coi <dig> is facilitated by ja- isoleucine   <cit> , the most bioactive ja, or coronatine , which is structurally similar to -7-iso-ja-lle  <cit> . to examine whether the stability of ppjaz <dig> was due to lack of interaction with coi <dig>  we used a yeast two-hybrid assay. although the positive control represented by atjaz-atcoi <dig> showed interaction in the presence of cor , ppjaz <dig> did not show interaction with atcoi <dig> or ppcoi <dig> either in the absence or presence of cor . together, these results suggest that the inability of ppjaz <dig> to interact with ppcoi <dig> leads to its heightened stability.

discussion
the role of ja during peach flower development
the role of ja as a floral display regulator in peach was initially supported by the significantly higher levels of ja and ja-ile in petals of pcl peach variety ‘glowing star’ compared to the ch variety ‘vabm29’. similarly, a recent report  <cit>  indicated that ja levels in the corollas of n. attenuata flowers peak at two dap  and then decrease sharply until anthesis  <cit> , suggesting that sustained ja concentration might be associated with restricted petal growth as is the case with the non-showy peach varieties. indeed, the negative impact of ja on petal elongation has already been demonstrated in arabidopsis ja-deficient mutant opr <dig> which exhibits enhanced petal growth compared to wt flowers  <cit> . furthermore, ja-deficient n. attenuata mutants  produced corollas that are longer than those of the wt, but their flowers failed to open  <cit> . in the latter example, the application of cor to young flower buds  encouraged flower opening, but cor failed to rescue flower opening when it was added to more developed buds. collectively, these observations indicate that ja transiently accumulates in patterns regulated by several feedback loops during the transition from bud stage to anthesis.

the uncoupled induction of ja-biosynthesis genes and the increase in ja levels in the petals of the pcl peach variety ‘glowing star’ during anthesis suggests that de novo synthesis is not the case, but it may be rather the transfer of ja to the petals from adjacent organs. indeed, ja biosynthesis is thought to occur in stamen filaments, and ja can be transported to petals by diffusion or through water flow  <cit> . the early anther dehiscence of peach pcl flowers , the enhancement of anther dehiscence by meja treatment , the small petal surface area of peach pcl flowers and the negative effect of meja application on the petal size , all suggest that ja is transported from stamens to petals shortly after anther dehiscence, leading to cessation of petal growth.

such coordination between stamens and petals through ja is crucial for the synchronization among anther dehiscence, petal expansion and flower opening, which enables cross-pollination in ch flowers  <cit> . further support for this hypothesis is provided by arabidopsis ja-biosynthesis  and perception  mutants, which show defects in anther development while producing large petals  <cit> . in these mutants, petal growth is delayed compared to the wt, but petals continue to grow after pollination and subsequently become larger than wt petals. similarly, mutations in osjar <dig>  the ja-amino acid synthetase, resulted in rice plants with defective anther dehiscence and flowers that stayed open for several days  <cit> , implying that the signal mediated through ja to regulate petal growth and flower opening is absent in these mutants. on the contrary, this signal appears to occur early in the pcl peach flowers, where anther dehiscence takes place early and, hence, the petals grow only slightly at the late developmental stages, avoiding an inefficient allocation of resources to floral display in this autogamous species . it has been shown already that the peach stigma naturally matures well before the ovary  <cit> , which is also consistent with cleistogamy.

ppjaz1-mediated cleistogamy
among the nine jaz genes investigated, only ppjaz <dig> showed different induction kinetics before and after flower opening. the higher induction of ppjaz <dig> in the cl flowers at stage v, along with the existence of potential binding sites for transcription factors with crucial roles in flower growth and development in its promoter region, strongly suggest that ppjaz <dig> is associated with the diverse phenotypes of peach flowers. the ectopic expression of ppjaz <dig> in tobacco was coupled with ceased flower opening and reduced corolla coloration, which further confirm the potential regulatory role of ppjaz <dig> during late stages of flower development. accumulation of anthocyanin, the pigment which gives tobacco flowers their color  <cit> , is induced by ja. the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes dfr, ldox, and uf3gt is almost abolished in arabidopsis coi <dig> plants  <cit> , which points to a molecular link between ja signaling and anthocyanin accumulation. hence, the loss of pigmentation in ppjaz <dig> tobacco flowers likely represents a form of ja-insensitivity in these plants.

the closed but self-fertilized cl phenotype mediated by the ectopic expression of ppjaz <dig> in tobacco is reminiscent of knocking-down eobii or its homologs in petunia , coyote tobacco , or ornamental tobacco  through the rnai-based approach  <cit> . similarly, knocking-out eobii homologs in arabidopsis  through t-dna insertion  <cit>  resulted in a cl flower phenotype. in case of arabidopsis and ornamental tobacco, such defects in flower opening were incidental observations and not the focus of experimentation. interestingly, the expression level of eobii homolog in tobacco  was negatively correlated with the level of ppjaz <dig> transgene expression in these plants , indicating that flower closure in these plants might be mediated through the inhibitory effects of ppjaz <dig> over the transcription of ntmyb <dig>  it has also been demonstrated that jaz proteins can physically interact with members of r2r <dig> myb transcription factors  and, hence, attenuate ja-mediated anthocyanin accumulation and ja-mediated anther development, respectively  <cit> . indeed, tobacco transgenic lines with high transcript levels of ppjaz <dig>  had short stamen filaments  and showed low corolla pigmentation . although the application of ga with sucrose and t-cinnamic acid partially restored flower opening in ir-pheob <dig> petunia plants  <cit> , neither ga nor meja treatments  could restore flower opening in cleistogamous cl <dig> a flowers . given the demonstrated stability of ppjaz <dig>  these results together suggest that ppjaz <dig> might have arrested the activity of myb <dig>  myb <dig> or other myb transcription factors which regulate the chasmogamous nature of wt tobacco flowers.

ppjaz <dig> stability
ectopic expression of ppjaz <dig> in tobacco led to ja-insensitivity similar to that obtained after expressing stabilized versions of arabidopsis jaz <dig>  jaz <dig> or jaz <dig>  which lack jas motifs , except that transgenic ppjaz <dig> plants are generally fertile. mutations in, or the removal of, jas motif lead to jaz stabilizations and consequent ja-insensitivity  <cit> . although the half-life of atjaz <dig> in the presence of ja was determined to be  <dig>  minutes  <cit> , ppjaz1-gfp protein expressed in arabidopsis roots or peach leaves did not show any degradation even after 60 minutes of meja treatment. yeast two-hybrid assays further confirmed the stability of ppjaz <dig>  where no interactions were detected between ppjaz <dig> with either ppcoi <dig> or atcoi <dig>  the comparison among ppjaz <dig> and all  <dig> arabidopsis jazs did not show any differences in jas motif or degron sequence that would abolish ppjaz <dig> ability to interact with coi <dig> and accordingly its degradability after meja treatment. the only difference in ppjaz <dig> was the asn  <dig>  which does not exist in arabidopsis jazs . how this difference might affect ppjaz <dig> interaction with coi <dig> is yet to be investigated.

stability of jaz proteins has recently been attributed to the spatial localization of ja signaling in different organs as well as the ja-mediated resource allocation trade-offs. for instance, recent reports have demonstrated that ja pathway regulation differs between roots and aerial parts due to ninja , which along with other elements constitutes a repressor complex negatively regulating ja-signaling. results showed that ninja are active mainly in roots in order to repress ja-mediated root inhibition and allow normal root growth. this role mediated by ninja is thought to involve stable jaz proteins which make up a part of the repressor complex  <cit> . furthermore, plants can manage resource allocation in aerial parts through enhancing the stabilization of jaz proteins under non-optimum light conditions, which in turn encourages growth more than defense  <cit> . similarly, the differential regulation of ja-related genes in leaves and flowers of ppjaz <dig> transgenic tobacco plants suggests ppjaz <dig> as a molecular switch to ja signaling in these organs. one of the ja signaling branches operates in leaves upon wounding/herbivore attack and probably involves jaz-myc interactions  <cit>  and their downstream genes, for example, lox <dig>  whereas another branch operates during floral development to regulate aspects of male fertility and flower opening and is likely controlled by jaz-myb interactions  <cit>  and the up-regulation of other ja-biosynthesis genes, for example, aoc through arf6/ <dig> .

from an ecological perspective, such a regulatory role of ppjaz <dig> should enhance plant fitness in harsh environments and preserve their ability to reproduce. harsh environmental conditions encourage the production of cleistogamous flowers  <cit> . hence, the higher expression of ppjaz <dig> transcripts in the pcl non-showy peach flowers could be evolutionarily driven by stressful conditions that favor induction of these stable forms of jaz proteins in order to switch resources toward self-pollination. among the features associated with enhancing selfing is the reduction in floral display features  that serve to attract pollinators. interestingly, earlier research indicated that cleistogamy protects peach flowers from both extreme weather  <cit>  and diseases, such as flower blight caused by monilinia sp., which usually attacks flowers through stamen filaments  <cit> . further investigations using different ja-deficient mutants could shed more light on these potential associated benefits.

CONCLUSIONS
our results clearly show the involvement of ppjaz <dig>  a stable form of a key intermediate of the ja signaling cascade, in regulating the variations of floral display and self-pollination. using tobacco as a heterologous experimental system we demonstrated that ppjaz <dig> expression can convert chasmogamous flowers into cleistogamous flowers. our results also point toward a role for ppjaz <dig> as a molecular switch for ja signaling in leaves and flowers, a potential mechanism by which plants shift to selfing under harsh environmental conditions. this represents a previously uncharacterized role of jaz proteins in plants.
