BACKGROUND
the development of the complex connectivity of the nervous system involves the concomitant elongation and guidance of axons to specific targets. growing axons are guided at their distal tips by growth cones, which move using relatively autonomous mechanisms to sense and respond to environmental cues. some of these cues are molecules distributed in gradients that either attract specific growth cones up their concentration gradients  or repel growth cones away from their sites of increasing concentrations . one structure whose formation has provided an excellent model in which to study axon guidance is the optic chiasm of the mammalian visual system.

retinal ganglion cell  axons from the two eyes converge on each other at the midline of the ventral part of the brain  where they either cross the midline  or turn away from it , forming the ×-shaped optic chiasm. the formation of this pathway is achieved through, the growth of rgc axons that exit the retina in tight bundles to reach the midline at a position ventral to the hypothalamus, where they either cross or do not cross depending on the retinal locations of their cell bodies. guidance molecules that have been implicated in these regulatory tasks include shh, which acts as a midline repellent to rgc axons except at the point where the chiasm forms
 <cit> , ephrinb <dig> and its receptor ephb <dig>  which are critical for ipsilateral/contralateral sorting
 <cit> , and the extracellular secreted molecules slit <dig> and slit <dig>  which signal via robo receptors to constrain axons to the region of the chiasm
 <cit> .

an interesting aspect of slit <dig> and slit <dig> function at the chiasm is that, although both are expressed at the hypothalamic ventral midline and rgc growth cones respond to individual slits
 <cit> , mice defective in either gene alone have been described as exhibiting either few or no rgc axon guidance defects at the optic chiasm
 <cit> . by contrast, in double-mutant mice lacking both slit <dig> and slit <dig>  a large additional chiasm develops anterior to the chiasm’s normal position
 <cit> . these results indicate that slit proteins co-operate to establish a corridor through which the axons are channelled, thereby helping define the site in the ventral diencephalon where the optic chiasm forms.

the nature of the co-operation between slit <dig> and slit <dig> at the optic chiasm, for example whether one plays a stronger a role than the other, is not clear. one of the main reasons is that previous analyses of the structure of the optic chiasm and the routes taken by the axons it contains rely on non-quantitative anatomical descriptions of its appearances after most or all of its axons have been labelled. the complexity of the chiasm and the large number of axons that it contains make it difficult to carry out quantifications that might reveal effects of the slits individually. in this work we adapted a method based on second-derivative gaussian steerable filters
 <cit>  to allow us to obtain quantitative information on the positions, curvatures and orientations of developing axons in large tracts such as the optic chiasm. steerable filters have been used successfully to quantify key properties of neuronal processes in vitro <cit> , where the separation of the processes makes them clearer and easier to analyze than in vivo. using a steerable-filters-based technique tailored specifically for our purposes, we found previously unreported defects at the optic chiasm of slit2−/− single-mutant mice that correlated with the normal expression pattern of slit <dig>  our results suggest that slit <dig> makes a greater contribution than slit <dig> to the guidance of rgc axons at the optic chiasm. the application of a similar approach to the analysis of other mutants and similarly complex pathways might be a profitable way of finding hitherto undetected defects in some strains.

RESULTS
quantitative analysis of labelled axons at the wild-type chiasm
we first examined dii-labelled axons at the optic chiasm of wild-type mice . figure
1a shows an example of the optic chiasm in a horizontal section at embryonic day  <dig>  . e <dig>  was selected because retinal axons have recently crossed the midline at this age, having first penetrated the diencephalon at e <dig>  erskine et al.,
 <cit> . it is, therefore, the earliest age offering the opportunity to observe potential defects of guidance at the chiasm in mutants.

figure
1b is a high magnification view of the same chiasm as in figure
1a, showing detail of the dii labelled axons. axons such as these were analyzed using gaussian steerable filters, examples of which are illustrated as oriented spatial functions in figure
1c. the filters were convolved with the images of dii-labelled chiasms. only data derived from points along axons were retained; points that were not on axons were excluded using non- maximum suppression, which removed data from areas that did not lie on ridges of high intensity with respect to the surrounding landscape of the image. figure
1d illustrates the outcome: the orientations of filter that gave the best response at each position along the axon are shown as arrows pointing away from the dii-injected eye . an example of applying the algorithm to all the axons at the chiasm is illustrated in figure
1e, which shows only a small subset of directions  for purposes of clarity. the subset is < <dig>  of the size of the full set, allowing the arrows to be shown enlarged compared to those in figure
1d. the algorithm provides a method to quantify automatically a vector field representing the orientations of axons in a given image and also the curls of the vector fields, which measure the degree of curvature of axons at each point. notice that the arrows representing direction  have a constant magnitude whereas those representing curvature  have both direction and length, with the length proportional to the amount of turning.

figure
 <dig> illustrates the results of applying the steerable filter algorithm to sets of e <dig>  embryos that were wild-type , slit1−/− , slit2−/−  or slit1−/−slit2−/− . figure
2a-d shows individual examples of chiasms analyzed as outlined in figure
 <dig>  as can be seen, there is considerable variation in the appearance of these examples, particularly between those that are slit2−/− or slit1−/−slit2−/− and those that are wild-type or slit1−/−. to assess whether this variation can be accounted for by differences in genotype, we combined results from applying the algorithm to all embryos of each genotype. figure
2e-h shows examples of vectors  representing axonal directions from all embryos of each genotype. data from different embryos are shown in different colours, providing a sample of the routes taken by axons in all embryos of each genotype. data from embryos within each genotype group were aligned using the grid system shown in figure
1a. the mean distance between the centre of the two eyes did not vary significantly with genotype, varying by < 8% between groups. the plots in figure
2e-h suggest an anterior shift in the position of the optic chiasm in slit2−/− and slit1−/−slit2−/− embryos compared to wild-type and slit1−/− embryos.
1e. scale bars =  <dig> μm.  plots show the direction vector fields overlaid  from all embryos of each genotype, with each colour representing data from a different embryo. only small subsets of arrows from each embryo have been plotted, for clarity.  heat-maps: in each square we calculated the mean number of arrows, including all arrows from all embryos of each genotype . a colour scale is used to illustrate the spatial distribution of mean densities on a relative scale for each genotype. a, e, i, wild-type, n = 9; b, f, j, slit1−/−, n = 11; c,g,k, slit2−/−, n = 5; d,h,l, slit1−/−slit2−/−, n =  <dig> 

to test this statistically, the area of each chiasm was split into a  <dig> ×  <dig> grid. figure
2i-l shows the spatial distributions of the mean numbers of oriented vector fields  across the chiasms of all embryos of each genotypes . all vectors were included . these values were proportional to the mean densities of axon within each square for each genotype, since in all cases analysis with steerable filters was done at constant intervals and filtering using non-maximum suppression prevented the inclusion of data from areas that contained no axons. note that while these values are proportional to the densities of axon within each square, and can therefore be used to examine distributions of axon, they can not be used to derive values for the absolute numbers of individual axons across the chiasm. our approach does not attempt to trace individual axons and can not, therefore, give their absolute numbers.

the graphs in figure
2i-l suggest an anteriorization of the population of chiasmatic axons in slit2−/− and slit1−/−slit2−/− embryos. for each area of the chiasm we tested for significant differences  between the values from wild-type and slit1−/−, slit2−/− or slit1−/−slit2−/− embryos: results are plotted in figure
3a,e, i. there were no significant differences between wild-type and slit1−/− embryos , but significantly larger densities of axon were located in abnormally anterior positions in both slit2−/− and slit1−/−slit2−/− embryos . there were no significant differences between slit2−/− and slit1−/−slit2−/− embryos .

axon orientations and curvatures in slit1−/−, slit2−/− and slit1−/−; slit2−/− embryos
the same procedure was then applied to values of orientation, curvature angle and curvature magnitude from each area across the chiasm. these values were the averages of the vectors within each square of the  <dig> ×  <dig> grid and, therefore, took no account of the trajectories of individual axons, e.g. whether they crossed each other or not. comparison of wild-type and slit1−/− embryos showed only a few areas returning statistically significant differences in either axon orientation or angle of curvature . comparison of wild-type and either slit2−/− or slit1−/−slit2−/− embryos showed many more areas returning statistically significant differences in axon orientation, many of which were located lateral to the midline . in slit1−/−slit2−/− double-mutant embryos there were also significant abnormalities of axonal orientations in a posterior area contralateral to the injected eye  that were not present in slit2−/− mutants. regarding the angle of axon curvature, most differences between genotypes were found around the midline . no comparison returned any significant differences in magnitudes of curvature . overall, these data indicate that, in slit2−/− and slit1−/−slit2−/− embryos, many axons are oriented abnormally in their route across the chiasm, an observation that agrees with our finding described above that many axons are mislocated. in slit1−/− embryos there were few axon orientation defects, in line with there being no detectable axonal mislocation.

comparison of axonal defects with patterns of slit expression
in agreement with previous studies, in situ hybridizations at e <dig>  revealed strong slit <dig> mrna expression both anterior and posterior to the junction of the optic nerve and the brain 
 <cit>  whereas expression of slit <dig> was strongest anterior to the point of entry of retinal axons 
 <cit> . the analysis above revealed that many retinal axons of slit2−/− and slit1−/−slit2−/− mutants crossed at abnormally anterior locations and here we examined the spatial relationship between the orientations of these axons and the normal slit <dig> expression pattern.

using the same strategy described above for analysis of axons, we combined data from three separate comparably-developed in situ hybridizations to give a map of the average staining intensity for slit <dig> across the ventral midline in  <dig> μm horizontal sections at the level of retinal axonal entry. the system illustrated in figure
1a was used to align data on gene expression in wild-types with data on retinal axons from wild-type or mutant embryos. results are shown in figure
 <dig>  the following vector-fields were obtained. for axons, mean orientations  and mean directions and magnitudes of curvature  were obtained within each square in the  <dig> ×  <dig> grid , using data from all embryos of each genotype. also within each square, the mean vector representing the gradient of slit <dig> expression was calculated . the location of these vector fields in the brain is shown in figure
5a.

axons were labelled from the left eye. in wild-types  labelled axons about 200μm to the left of the midline were oriented roughly 45–75° relative to the midline. they turned to run roughly orthogonal to the midline as they as they approached it . in taking this course, the axons were oriented roughly  orthogonal to the vectors representing the slit <dig> gradient and, therefore, avoided the anterior region of high slit <dig> expression . in contrast, axons on the left of the midline in slit2−/− mutants were oriented roughly orthogonal to the midline throughout their approach, thereby entering the anterior areas where slit <dig> would normally be expressed. many turned at the midline to exit through the contralateral area of high slit <dig> expression . a similar pattern was observed in slit1−/−slit2−/− mutants .

all these analyses together provide a consistent picture in which loss of either slit <dig> alone or slit <dig> and slit <dig> together result in many retinal axons being misoriented on approach and exit from the ventral midline and many being located abnormally anteriorly, where slit <dig> would normally be expressed. it appears that slit <dig> is required to prevent retinal axons from taking this anterior route.

discussion
in this study we have shown it is possible to apply relatively simple image analysis methods to static images of developing axons, quantify key properties relevant to the study of axon guidance and combine data from multiple embryos to make statistical comparisons between groups sharing a particular property . since it is very difficult to trace individual axons in dense axonal tracts in vivo, our approach was to determine the average positions, directions and curvatures of populations of axons. data were combined from multiple embryos so as to allow statistical comparisons that took into account variations between individual embryos or introduced by technical factors such as the degree of fixation, the amount of tracer injected or the precise plane of section in each individual. using this approach, we detected the previously-described defect of chiasm development in slit1−/−slit2−/− mutants
 <cit> . the real value of additional objectivity was demonstrated by our detection of hitherto unreported defects in slit2−/− mutants.

based on their qualitative examination of mutant chiasms, plump et al.
 <cit>  stated that they were unable to detect defects at the chiasm of slit2−/− mutants, with the caveat that they could not exclude defects that were beyond the sensitivity of their experiments. in fact, in the example that they show of labelled axons at the chiasm of slit2−/− mutants  the anteroposterior width of the tract at the midline is about double the width of the wild-type. our quantitative results indicate that there is indeed a defect of the slit2−/− chiasm with many axons mislocated abnormally anteriorly. our results agree with the conclusion of plump et al.
 <cit>  that there are no major defects at the chiasm of slit1−/− mutants. regarding the comparison of slit2−/− and slit1−/−slit2−/− embryos, we found significant misorientation of some of the posterior axons contralateral to the injected eye in double mutants, but otherwise they were similar to single mutants. such misorientation of posterior axons was not found in slit1−/− mutants, indicating that there are abnormalities of double mutants that are not present in either mutant alone. overall, however, our results indicate that, early in the formation of the chiasm, slit <dig> plays a more powerful role than slit <dig> in constraining the growth of axons to their correct location across the ventral midline.

while our results suggest a greater similarity between the effects of loss of slit <dig> alone and loss of both slit <dig> and slit <dig> than was suggested by plump et al.
 <cit> , the results of the two studies are in fact not strictly comparable. plump et al.
 <cit>  reported a major difference between the slit2−/− and slit1−/−slit2−/− genotypes at e <dig> , which is two days later than our findings. although they reported defects of the double mutants at earlier ages, including e <dig> , that look very similar to those found here, they did not provide data on slit2−/− embryos at earlier ages. this raises the interesting possibility that the effects of losing both slit <dig> and slit <dig> become progressively more severe than those of losing slit <dig> alone as the chiasm develops from e <dig>  to e <dig> .

the slit−/− phenotypes reported here have a striking correlation to the ectopic projection of slit−/− retinal axons to the contralateral eye that we reported previously. in wild-type and slit1−/− embryos the inter-retinal projection is relatively small indicating that slit <dig> is dispensable for keeping retinal axons out of the opposite eye. in contrast, loss of slit <dig> function results in a dramatic increase in the size of the inter-retinal misprojection and a further increase occurs in slit1−/−; slit2−/− embryos
 <cit> . it is easy to imagine that these phenotypes are causally linked: those retinal axons that cross the midline in aberrant positions in slit mutants are liable to end up on a track which predisposes them to misproject to the opposite eye. this provides an example of how the novel analysis techniques described here can shed extra light on axon guidance phenotypes previously observed using more traditional techniques.

the effect of slit <dig> is likely explained by its spatial pattern of expression, which was studied here by in situ hybridization due to the lack of suitable antibodies. clearly, it would be preferable to examine the distribution of slit proteins, and our analysis of this issue is based on the assumption that the protein distribution would approximate to the mrna distribution at a tissue level. slit <dig> mrna is expressed in the ventral midline in a position anterior to the normal chiasm. it is straightforward to understand how loss of this expression might be a critical factor allowing axons to cross in an abnormally anterior position. the effects of slit <dig> loss are intriguing and less easily explained. slit <dig> is normally expressed both anterior and posterior to the point of entry of retinal axons. its loss in combination with that of slit <dig> causes some misorientation of posterior axons after they have crossed the midline, but why this defect is not detected in single slit1−/− embryos is not clear. it appears that the presence of other factors provides sufficient guidance even in the absence of slit <dig> and that slit <dig> might be one of these other factors. how slit <dig> and slit <dig> cooperate to prevent contralateral posterior misguidance is not clear. it is possible that slit <dig> prevents axons approaching the midline from acquiring abnormalities that predispose some of them to require slit <dig> repulsion from posterior contralateral territory. in this scenario slit <dig> repulsion would only be required if slit <dig> is lost.

CONCLUSIONS
our results identify a previously undetected but important role of slit <dig> alone at the chiasm, while also showing some degree of cooperation between slit <dig> and slit <dig> and a lack of an obvious role for slit <dig> alone, as suggested by previous work . we suggest that the approach adopted here can increase the sensitivity for detecting axonal defects in mutant strains and might be adopted more widely in the future.
