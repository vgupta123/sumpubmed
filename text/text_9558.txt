BACKGROUND
mastitis is an inflammatory condition affecting the mammary gland and the most frequent disease resulting in serious economic losses and herd management problems in dairy production. bovine mastitis is caused by infection with pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis and escherichia coli <cit> .

s. aureus is a widespread pathogen of relevance to both human and veterinary medicine. it is a major causative factor of bovine mastitis in norway , causes clinical and subclinical intramammary infections and produces 200– <dig> virulence factors. it has been demonstrated that s. aureus invades and survives within mammalian host cells and is competent to replicate in the phagosome or escape the phagosome and persist within the host cells, which can induce anti-apoptotic programs in phagocytes  <cit> . intracellular survival of s. aureus has been implied as an immune-evasive strategy causing chronic mastitis infections in cattle. chronically infected animals are sources of recurrent infections and contribute to spreading s. aureus to other cows and herds.

monocytes and macrophages are critical effectors and regulators of inflammation serving as the first line of innate defence against invading pathogens. during inflammation, circulating monocytes migrate from the blood to tissues in response to chemokine signaling where they differentiate into macrophages. macrophages are capable of phagocytosis and production of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . in the bovine udder, macrophages are present in the mammary gland interstitium and alveolar cells, defending epithelium from invading pathogens  <cit> . local recruitment and action of macrophages in the mammary gland is an essential immunological defence mechanism against infection.

in addition to the classical macrophage activation  induced by interferon gamma , where t helper  <dig> cell-type activation of macrophages triggers a pro-inflammatory response required to kill intracellular pathogens, macrophages also undergo alternative activation. alternatively activated macrophages  are characterized by suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines, anti-inflammatory effects and reduced killing capacity toward pathogens  <cit> . recently, m <dig> macrophages have been further divided into three subsets: m2a, induced by the t helper  <dig> cytokines interleukin  <dig>  and il- <dig> and referred to as wound-healing and tissue repair macrophages; m2b, a less understood group; and m2c, stimulated by il- <dig> and referred to as regulatory macrophages and deactivators of the immune response  <cit> . it has been proposed that alternative activation of macrophages triggered by the intracellular pathogen francisella tularensis is a mechanism by which bacteria can evade the host immune response to favor its intracellular survival  <cit> .

macrophages can also be activated through expression of macrophage surface receptor tumor necrosis factor superfamily member  <dig>  and its functional ligation with cd <dig> ligand  expressed on activated t helper cells. cd <dig> signaling in macrophages induces the nuclear factor kappa b -mediated synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1a, il-1b and tumor necrosis factor alpha , and several chemokines  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that ifnb <dig> and tnfa proteins increase expression of cd <dig> protein in human endothelial cells and blood-derived dendritic cells  <cit> , and nfkb complex increases expression of cd <dig> in murine dendritic cells  <cit> . moreover, studies of the intracellular pathogen toxoplasma gondii have shown that cd <dig> signaling induces the tnfa-dependent antimicrobial activity of macrophages even in the absence of ifng and production of reactive nitrogen intermediates, central elements of classically activated macrophages  <cit> .

it has been suggested previously, that s. aureus cell wall peptidoglycan is a biological effector with different stimulatory activities for several pattern recognition receptors  of immune cells such as toll-like receptor  <dig>  and cytosolic nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain -containing proteins. however, later studies have reported that s. aureus lipoproteins are ligands for tlr <dig>  <cit>  and after engulfment of s. aureus by macrophages, the tlr2/tlr <dig> complex is recruited to phagosomes for an efficient lipoprotein and tlr <dig> interaction . tlr <dig> uses a myeloid differentiation primary response gene  <dig> -dependent signaling pathway resulting in nfkb-mediated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. however, binding of s. aureus peptidoglycan components to intracellular nod <dig> protein leads to nuclear translocation of nfkb and induction of cytokine production and inflammation .

the aim of this study was to evaluate an early phase gene response of bovine macrophages to infection with live s. aureus. challenging macrophages with live bacteria induces several genes and pathways that are involved in immunological response likely also during intramammary infections. transcript profiling of blood monocyte-derived macrophages challenged with s. aureus for  <dig> and 6 hours in vitro were assessed by microarray and the expression of selected genes was validated by reverse transcription-quantitative pcr .

discussion
in this study we have investigated gene response of bovine macrophages to in vitro infection with live s. aureus in order to illuminate the putative mechanism underlying the early immune response for instance during mastitis in cattle. our results have shown that infection of macrophages with s. aureus induced both alternative and classical activation pathways. the most pronounced functional network over-represented in the qtl related subset of our data  involved anti-inflammatory cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig> and socs <dig> as central molecules and these genes were found to be up-regulated . moreover, several proinflammatory cytokines classically activated upon tlr <dig> signaling in response to s. aureus were up-regulated in our study , e.g. il-1b and tnfa, and tlr <dig> was identified as one of the putative upstream regulators . it has been shown that tlr <dig> is involved in prolonged survival of s. aureus in macrophage phagosomes, which was explained by tlr2-dependent inhibition of superoxide production  <cit> . our data support this study, however we suggest that s. aureus infection induces tlr2-dependent alternative activation of macrophages. this is consistent with the model proposed for intracellular bacterial survival of f. tularensis. f. tularensis enters macrophages by a tlr2-dependent mechanism that initiates a temporary inflammatory response. the macrophages are induced to produce il- <dig> and il- <dig> that in turn triggers alternative activation of macrophages and allows f. tularensis to replicate freely. alternatively activated macrophages produce anti-inflammatory il- <dig>  which inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by classically activated macrophages  <cit> . the up-regulation of t helper  <dig> type cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  in our study may suggest that s. aureus infection has polarized bovine macrophages toward a m <dig> subset with wound repair m2a and immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory m2c phenotypes.

also, it has been demonstrated recently that infection with intracellular mycobacterium tuberculosis activates the alternative phenotype of macrophages that inhibit autophagy-dependent maturation and killing of mycobacteria, which indicates that alternative activation of macrophages may contribute to the persistence of mycobacterial infection  <cit> . furthermore, increased cell survival and viability with several inhibitors of apoptosis was found in our study as one of the top molecular functions and networks . bad, baculoviral iap repeat-containing  <dig> , birc <dig> and birc <dig> were found to be up-regulated in response to s. aureus infection  and birc <dig> was found among the differentially expressed genes in list eqg . it has been shown that phosphorylation of bad protein and expression of birc <dig> mrna increased cell survival  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated that apoptosis in phagocytes can also be modulated by pathogens  <cit>  and the increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes in s. aureus infected human macrophages is responsible for extended phagocyte lifetime allowing intracellular bacterial survival  <cit> . interestingly, birc <dig> and socs <dig> are located in the region of qtl markers associated with somatic cell score  in nrf  <cit> , and elevated scs is often an indicator of subclinical mastitis in cattle infected with s. aureus. likely, s. aureus evades the host immune system by induction of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic factors in invaded host cells, which allows the pathogen to persist and replicate in the infected cells during the early stage of inflammation. these findings point toward il- <dig> and il- <dig> as possible expression qtl  for s. aureus induced mastitis, and socs <dig> and birc <dig> as possible eqtl for chronic infections in cattle.

cd <dig> and several proinflammatory cytokines e.g. il-1b, tnfa and il- <dig> were up-regulated in our dataset, and cd <dig> was predicted as the most significant upstream regulator . recent studies have shown, that the synergy of tlr <dig> and cd <dig> signaling contributes to activation of resting b cells  <cit>  and tlr <dig> signaling controls an early listeria monocytogenes infection which involve co-stimulatory molecule cd <dig>  <cit> . moreover, tlr2-dependent activation of nfkb complex and tnfa likely induced co-stimulatory function of cd <dig> signaling in the absence of other immune activators, such as t helper cells or ifng  <cit> . this may suggest that tlr2-dependent activation may also require co-stimulatory function of cd <dig> for efficient s. aureus lipoproteins-induced signaling in macrophages. it has also been shown that cd <dig> signaling in macrophages is modulated by il- <dig> and il- <dig> anti-inflammatory cytokines that act via different mechanisms likely including socs  <cit> , and il- <dig> signaling was found as a top canonical pathway in our dataset . this data together with findings that induction of il- <dig> expression in alternatively activated macrophages is tlr2-dependent suggest that cd <dig> signaling may likely be controlled by anti-inflammatory output of alternative activation of bovine macrophages induced by s. aureus infection.

the top kegg pathway found in david was the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor  signaling pathway , while the top canonical pathway found in ipa was triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells  <dig>  signaling . the synergy between tlr <dig> and trem <dig> stimulates intracellular signals resulting in phagocytosis and production of proinflammatory cytokines. additionally, trem <dig> signaling induces proinflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial muropeptides via the casp1-dependent pathway. this signaling involves increased nod <dig> gene transcription suggesting that trem <dig> acts to amplify the signal also from intracellular nlr proteins  <cit> . in addition to tnfa and il-1b, casp <dig> and nfkb <dig> were found to be up-regulated in our study  suggesting that trem <dig> signaling may likely provide the link between tlr2- and nlr-mediated signal transduction in cytokine-induced inflammation during the initiation of host defense such as in mastitis. furthermore, the most pronounced functional network over-represented in our data involved nfkb as a central molecule , suggesting that nfkb is a fundamental transcription factor linking tlr2-, cd40- and nlr-mediated signaling and induction of proinflammatory activities of macrophages in response to s. aureus.

peptidoglycan was identified as the most significant upstream regulator for the list eqg . previous studies have shown that s. aureus lipoteichoic acid  and/or peptidoglycan activate the macrophages through intracellular nod signaling  <cit> . it was demonstrated in cattle that the s. aureus peptidoglycan component synergized with lta induced production of chemokines in mammary epithelial cells and neutrophil recruitment in the mammary gland  <cit> . this is also pronounced in our data, where the top canonical pathway for genes from list eqg was related to ‘role of cytokines in mediating communication between immune cells’, with il- <dig> and cxc-chemokine ligand  <dig>  chemokines among the significantly up-regulated genes . these results suggest that il- <dig> and cxcl <dig> may be potential eqtl for neutrophil recruitment during s. aureus induced intramammary infections in cattle. these findings together imply an important role for staphylococcal peptidoglycan in nod signaling mediated immune response during mastitis in cattle with likely the principal role of neutrophil recruitment, as demonstrated earlier in the mammary gland  <cit> . intracellular nlr are likely involved in peptidoglycan-induced signaling in macrophages, independent of lipopeptides/tlr <dig> interaction and signaling as demonstrated earlier  <cit> .

we were not able to identify any significantly differentially expressed genes at the 2 h time point, while several genes were found at 3 h p.i in another study  <cit> . the variation between the individuals in macrophage gene expression in response to s. aureus infection was high at the 2 h time point resulting in the lack of significantly regulated genes. this may be due to relatively low expression level of immune response genes at its earliest stage of bacterial infection when high variation is more pronounced compared to the 6 h time point.

our results are in agreement with previous studies of s. aureus mastitis in ruminants  <cit> . however, we have identified the anti-inflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig>  which suggests that s. aureus infection probably leads to induction of alternative activation of the macrophages . the results of this study may reflect the importance of macrophages in modulating the host immune response during mastitis in cattle. it should be noted however, that our data are based on in vitro analysis of blood monocyte-derived macrophages. consequently, the hypothesis needs to be further evaluated by studies of macrophages from bovine mammary glands infected with s. aureus.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated the novel finding that s. aureus infection most probably induces tlr2-dependent alternative activation of macrophages which contributes to persisting staphylococcal infection. moreover, cd <dig> and trem <dig> signaling pathways appear as the most interesting candidates that likely provide the link between tlr2- and nlr-mediated signal transduction determining optimal host defence during mastitis. our study may reflect the role of macrophages in the immune defense of the udder and contributes to further elucidation of the mechanism of early inflammatory responses such as during mastitis in cattle.
