BACKGROUND
invasive candida infections are a serious and often fatal nosocomial disease in immunocompromised patients. the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is difficult because there are no specific clinical manifestations of the disease and colonization and infection are difficult to distinguish. conventional microbiological methods, which include observation of the infecting fungus by histopathology and culture, usually lack both sensitivity and specificity and sometimes they require invasive procedures that can not be accomplished because of the clinical conditions of the patients  <cit> . as a result of these problems, therapy is often initiated late in the course of infection, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality  <cit> .

during the last two decades, much effort has been made to develop reliable tests for rapid diagnosis of invasive candidiasis leading to appropriate therapy. these techniques include the detection of fungal nucleic acid by pcr  <cit> ,  β-d-glucan  <cit> , d-arabinitol  <cit>  and a number of circulating antigens and antibodies  <cit> . however, all techniques have limitations and, at the moment, none of them have found widespread clinical use.

candida albicans is a fungus that can grow in either the yeast form or the hyphal form, and the ability to germinate and form hyphae may be a factor for the virulence of this organism in vivo  <cit> . our group has previously reported that the detection of antibodies specifically directed to antigens expressed on the c. albicans germ tube surface  by indirect immunofluorescence has shown a sensitivity of 79– <dig> % and a specificity of 91–100% for the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis on both competent and immunocompromised patients  <cit> . a number of antigens specifically expressed on the c. albicans germ tube cell wall have been identified recently including hyphal wall protein  <dig>   <cit> , als3p  <cit> , ece1p  <cit>  and hyr1p  <cit> . as it has been studied in other mycoses  <cit> , these antigens can be obtained in recombinant form, allowing the detection of antibodies against them.

in this study, we report the development of both an immunoblotting and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  for the serodiagnosis of invasive candida spp. infections by detecting specific antibodies against a recombinant n-terminal fragment of hwp <dig>  results were compared with an immunofluorescence test to detect antibodies to cagt.

RESULTS
characterization of the recombinant n-hwp <dig> fragment
the purified n-hwp <dig> fragment obtained in this study yielded a protein with an apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda, while the purified int-hwp <dig> yielded a protein of  <dig> kda . both recombinant fragments reacted by immunoblotting with the anti hsv·tag® monoclonal antibody . however, the anti hsv·tag® monoclonal antibody revealed that the purified n-hwp <dig> migrated as a doublet of 36– <dig> kda. the purified rhwp1n13kv-c~myc fragment yielded a protein of  <dig> kda . a monoclonal antibody against the c-myc·tag revealed that the purified rhwp1n13kv-c~myc fragment migrated also as a doublet of 34– <dig> kda . differences in molecular mass between n-hwp <dig> and rhwp1n13kv-c~myc proteins are explained by the different size of the hwp <dig> fragments and the different tags used.

a rabbit anti-n-hwp <dig> antiserum reacted with both n-terminal hwp <dig> fragments . the antiserum revealed the existence of two closely located bands in both n-hwp <dig> and rhwp1n13kv-c~myc fragments with molecular masses of 36– <dig> kda and 34– <dig> kda, respectively . the specificity of the anti-n-hwp <dig> antiserum was confirmed by the lack of reactivity with the int-hwp <dig> fragment .

detection of antibodies by immunoblotting
the reactivity of the n-hwp <dig> was tested by immunoblotting with  <dig> sera from  <dig> different patients. the n-terminal fragment was recognized as a double band of 36– <dig> kda by sera from <dig> patients from group  <dig>  . in four patients, the antibody response against n-hwp <dig> was detected after the blood culture positive for candida. group  <dig> patients with antibodies against the recombinant n-hwp <dig> fragment were infected with c. albicans and c. glabrata . sera from patients infected with c. tropicalis, c. krusei, c. guilliermondii, c. parapsilosis and c. utilis did not recognize the recombinant n-hwp <dig> fragment by this technique. the majority of group  <dig> patients did not react by western blotting . however, two patients from group  <dig>  had antibodies that reacted with the recombinant n-hwp <dig> fragment . none of the sera recognized the int-hwp <dig> fragment.

the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a diagnostic test based on the detection of antibodies against the n-hwp <dig> fragment by immunoblotting were  <dig>  %,  <dig> %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively.

detection of antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence
antibodies to cagt were detected in  <dig> patients with invasive candidiasis  . these patients had titers of antibodies to cagt ranging 1: <dig> to 1: <dig>  and in  <dig> patients , the titer was ≥ 1: <dig>  group  <dig> patients showing antibodies to cagt ≤ 1: <dig> were mainly infected by non-c. albicans species, including c. parapsilosis, c. guilliermondii, c. krusei and c. tropicalis . only  <dig> out of  <dig>  patients without evidence of invasive candidiasis  had antibodies to cagt at titer ≥ 1: <dig> .

considering a cutoff value of = 1: <dig>  the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a diagnostic test based on the detection of antibodies to cagt were  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively.

detection of antibodies by elisa
in an attempt to increase the low sensitivity of the detection of antibodies against the n-hwp <dig> fragment by immunoblotting, we developed and elisa assay for the diagnosis invasive candidiasis. the cutoff value was defined as the mean plus  <dig> times the standard deviation of the relative absorbance values of the sera obtained from patients without evidence of candidiasis. relative absorbance values above the cutoff were considered positive whereas results under the cutoff were negative. thirty-two out of  <dig> patients from group  <dig>  were positive by the elisa test . two patients infected with c. albicans and one patient each infected with c. guilliermondii and c. krusei were negative by this assay . eight out of  <dig> patients from group  <dig> tested  showed false positive results by elisa . group i patients showed higher amounts of antibodies against n-hwp <dig> fragment than patients from group ii, since the mean plus standard deviation were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively .

the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a diagnostic test based on the detection of antibodies to the n-hwp <dig> fragment by elisa were  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. patients infected with c. albicans were more likely to have antibodies to the n-hwp <dig> fragment above the cutoff value. in fact, if only patients infected with c. albicans were taken into consideration, the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the test increased to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, while the specificity remained unaltered.

in a subgroup of  <dig> group  <dig> patients, the availability of serial serum samples allowed to study the kinetics of antibody response to the n-hwp <dig> fragment by elisa and to cagt. antibody titers became positive before the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis was made in  <dig> patients by elisa and in  <dig> patients by indirect immunofluorescence. interestingly, the kinetics of antibody response to the n-hwp <dig> fragment of by elisa was very similar to that observed by indirect immunofluorescence and antibody titers showed a constant rise around the time the clinical and microbiological evidence of invasive candidiasis existed and then fell below the cutoff value if the patient responded to antifungal therapy. the kinetics of antibody response in a patient with invasive candidiasis is shown in fig.  <dig> 

the relationship between the results obtained by elisa and indirect immunofluorescence is shown in figure  <dig>  in patients infected with c. albicans, results obtained by both techniques showed a good agreement since only three patients  were positive by only one technique. in patients infected with non-albicans candida species, the agreement was lower since four patients  were positive by elisa but negative by indirect immunofluorescence. antibody titers obtained with both techniques were lower for patients infected with non-albicans species than for those infected with c. albicans.

homology between c. albicans hwp <dig> and other candida proteins
the presence in patients infected by non-albicans candida species of antibodies that cross-react with c. albicans n-hwp <dig> may be explained by the existence of common epitopes in c. albicans hwp <dig> and other proteins present in non-albicans candida species. to test this hypothesis we searched the genbank database for homology between c. albicans hwp <dig> and other candida proteins. interestingly, the region encoding the first  <dig> amino acid residues of hwp <dig> showed homology with the sequence of proteins of c. dubliniensis, c. famata, c. glabrata and c. lipolytica .

discussion
due to the commensal nature of members of genus candida, the key factor in the laboratory diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is the differentiation between infection and colonization. from a serological point of view, this differentiation may be facilitated if different types of antibodies are detected in each situation. our group has previously reported the detection of antibodies to cagt, which are usually detected in patients with invasive candidiasis at titers ≥  <dig> and are absent or detected at very low titers in patients without invasive candidiasis despite of being colonized by candida spp.  <cit> . the basis for this discrimination lies on the different antigenic composition of blastospores and germ tubes of c. albicans, since germ tubes but not blastospores express a high molecular weight antigen that induces an antibody response  <cit> . due to the mannoproteic nature of the antigen, the detection of antibodies to cagt requires the adsorption of antibodies directed against mannan since they are ubiquitous in human sera  <cit> .

identification of genes encoding antigens specific for the hyphal phase of c. albicans has opened new ways to study the usefulness of these antigens in the serological diagnosis of invasive candidiasis. for example, they can be obtained in recombinant form which, in addition to the availability of highly standardized reagents, will be non-glycosylated when they have been expressed in e. coli. the lack of glycosylation of these recombinant antigens is important because the adsorption of the sera to remove the anti-mannan antibodies will not be necessary, an important improvement when the elisa test is compared to the detection of antibodies to cagt.

c. albicans hwp <dig> is one of the phase-specific genes most studied. the glycoprotein encoded by this gene is specifically expressed on the cell wall surface of germ tubes and hyphae of c. albicans  <cit> , and may be required for virulence in systemic candidiasis  <cit> . its location on the cell wall surface may facilitate the production of antibodies against this protein by the c. albicans-infected host. since the protein has a surface-exposed n-terminal domain that binds antibodies while the carboxyl terminus is most probably covalently integrated in cell wall  <cit> , we selected that fragment of hwp <dig> for our serological studies. the molecular mass of the n-hwp <dig> was determined to be  <dig> kda, much larger than the calculated  <dig> kda. the same discrepancy was observed with the rhwp1n13kv-c~myc fragment used as control, since it yielded a protein of  <dig> kda when the predicted molecular mass was  <dig>  kda. the lack of agreement between the predicted molecular mass and the sds-page-determined molecular mass has been reported previously and is related to the high proline content of hwp <dig>  <cit> . the peculiar migration of the n-terminal fragments of hwp <dig> in sds-page gels seems to be also responsible for the doublet revealed in the western blots by the anti-n-hwp <dig> antiserum and by sera from patients with invasive candidiasis. both bands of each doublet are likely to be the same protein since they also reacted with the monoclonal antisera against the tag sequences of n-hwp <dig> and rhwp1n13kv-c~myc proteins. interestingly, a proline-rich antigen from coccidioides immitis expressed in e. coli also migrated as a doublet in sds-page gels  <cit> .

the diagnostic potential of the detection of antibodies against the n-hwp <dig> fragment was studied by two different techniques: immunoblotting and elisa. while detection of antibodies by immunoblotting showed a very poor sensitivity and negative predictive values, detection of antibodies against the n-terminal fragment of hwp <dig> by elisa notably increased the diagnostic validity, with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. interestingly, these results were very close to those obtained by detecting antibodies to cagt by indirect immunofluorescence. the kinetics of antibody response to cagt antigens was also similar to that of antibodies against the recombinant protein. in some patients, antibody titers showed a constant rise in association with the clinical and microbiological diagnosis of invasive candidiasis and then decreased and eventually fell under the cut-off level if the patient responded to antifungal therapy. these results are in agreement with previously reported results detecting antibodies to cagt by indirect immunofluorescence  <cit> . the relationship between the results obtained by detecting antibodies to n-hwp <dig> and cagt was higher in patients infected with c. albicans than in patients infected with non-albicans candida species. in both cases, the majority of the discrepancies were due to the highest sensitivity of the elisa, since six patients were positive by elisa and negative by indirect immunofluorescence. four of the six patients were infected with non-albicans candida species, confirming previous observations that non-albicans candida species induce lower titers of antibodies to cagt  <cit> .

false negative results by indirect immunofluorescence were observed in a group of patients who were infected by non-albicans candida species. these results are in agreement with previously published results  <cit> . this is despite evidence that most clinically relevant non-albicans candida species including c. stellatoidea, c. guilliermondii, c. tropicalis, c. parapsilosis, and c. krusei grown at 37°c have antigens that cross-react with those present in the c. albicans germ tube cell wall  <cit> . interestingly, the elisa test demonstrated that antibodies to the n-terminal fragment of c. albicans hwp <dig> are detected in patients with infections by non-albicans candida species including c. parapsilosis, c. tropicalis, c. utilis, c. glabrata and c. dubliniensis. the reasons for this reactivity are presently unknown since hwp <dig> is exclusively synthesized during hyphal growth of c. albicans  <cit> . however, most clinically relevant candida species, including c. glabrata, can produce pseudomycelium  <cit>  and it has been recently reported that hwp <dig> mrna may also arise from pseudohyphal growth forms in c. albicans, or possibly from yeast forms, although experimental data to support the presence of hwp <dig> mrna in yeast forms has not been reported  <cit> . it may be possible that under certain conditions, some non-albicans candida species express antigens that elicit antibodies that cross-react with c. albicans hwp <dig>  in agreement with this, moran et al.  <cit>  have recently identified in c. dubliniensis an orf of  <dig> bp with homology to c. albicans hwp <dig>  especially in the region encoding the first  <dig> residues of each protein, and we have observed that the region encoding the first  <dig> amino acid residues of hwp <dig> shows homology with the sequence of proteins of a number of non-albicans candida species including c. dubliniensis, c. famata, c. glabrata and c. lipolytica.

the existence of antibodies that cross-react with c. albicans hwp <dig> in patients infected by non-albicans candida species does not seem to decrease the specificity of the elisa test developed in this study, since these antibodies seem to be present mostly in patients with invasive candidiasis. on the contrary, the existence of this cross-reactivity can be used to increase the sensitivity of the test, especially in a time when infections by non-albicans candida species are increasing  <cit> . however, further studies investigating the induction of c. albicans hwp1-like antigens by non-albicans candida species are warranted.

the high sensitivity and specificity showed by the elisa test developed in this study to detect antibodies against the n-terminal fragment of hwp <dig> in the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis seem to be useful to detect the low levels of antibodies that may be present in hematological patients. however, an increase in both parameters might be obtained by detecting antibodies against other c. albicans germ tube specific antigens such as als3p  <cit> , ece1p  <cit>  and/or hyr1p  <cit> . a mixture of all these antigens may be used in the same elisa in order to optimize the result. alternatively, an increase in the sensitivity can be obtained by combining the detection of antibodies to the n-terminal fragment of hwp <dig> with a test that detects candida antigens.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that is possible to develop an elisa test that allows the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis by detecting antibodies to the n-terminal fragment of c. albicans hwp <dig>  this test is simpler to perform than the detection of antibodies to cagt since it does not need the adsorption of the patient's serum and allows both an objective measurement and the automatization of the test.
