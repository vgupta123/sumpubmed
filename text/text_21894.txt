BACKGROUND
sulfation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification that affects the biological activity of a wide variety of substrates, ranging in molecular mass from less than  <dig> to greater than  <dig> da. the reaction is catalyzed by sulfotransferases using 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate  <dig> as the sulfate donor  <cit> . there are  <dig> sulfotransferases in humans and they can be divided into two major groups according to their sub-cellular localization: those found in cytoplasm and those found in the golgi apparatus  <cit> . cytosolic sulfotransferases, commonly designated as sults, are mainly involved in modifying small molecules , such as steroids, neurotransmitters, and xenobiotics  <cit> . along with p <dig> enzymes, sults play important roles in drug detoxification  <cit> . golgi resident sulfotransferases are involved in modifying numerous glycans and proteins on the cell membranes and within extracellular matrix. glycan sulfation is known to affect hormone pharmacokinetics  <cit> , growth factor and cytokine activity  <cit> , viral  <cit>  and bacterial  <cit>  invasion. protein sulfation is known to be important in protein-protein interactions, such as leukocyte adhesion molecule psgl- <dig> binding to p-selectin on activated endothelium  <cit> .

although the significance and pervasiveness of sulfation have gradually been realized, research on this area has been hampered by the inconvenient assay systems currently available. usually, sulfotransferase assays rely on chromatography steps, such as hplc  <cit>  and tlc  <cit> , to separate substrates and products. however, hplc is difficult to process multiple samples and tlc is unsuitable to separate proteins and polysaccharides. recently, hplc coupled mass spectrometry has been applied to characterize sulfotransferase products  <cit> , but it is difficult to assess enzymatic activity due to its nature of being semiquantitative. colorimetric  <cit>  and fluorescent sulfotransferase assays  <cit>  have also been explored, but these assays are limited to substrates with colorimetric or fluorescent properties. we have developed a versatile electrophoresis-based sulfotransferase assay that can be applied to substrates ranging from small molecules, such as α-naphthol, to large molecules, such as proteoglycans, by taking advantage of the fact that both small and large molecules can be separated from paps during sds-page .

RESULTS
assay development for rhchst4
as an illustration of the general procedure of assay development for all sulfotransferases, the assay for recombinant human carbohydrate sulfotransferase  <dig>  is described here . chst <dig>  also known as high endothelial cell n-acetylglucosamine 6-o-sulfotransferase  or l-selectin ligand sulfotransferase , catalyzes the sulfation at the 6-o position of the non-reducing end n-acetylglucosamine  residues within mucin-associated glycans  <cit> . instead of using native glycan, we used a disaccharide glcnacman as the acceptor substrate.

each rhchst <dig> reaction started with  <dig>  pmol acceptor substrate and  <dig>  pmol of donor substrate. to locate the linear response region of rhchst <dig>  an activity-enzyme plot was first established from  <dig> to  <dig> ng enzyme input in a 2-fold serial dilution fashion . the linear response region was then located from  <dig> to  <dig> ng of enzyme input and the experiment was repeated within this region. a second activity-enzyme plot was then established and a linear regression equation was obtained based on this second plot . because the equation was based on four consecutive data points and had correlation coefficient r <dig> =  <dig> , the slope of the equation,  <dig> pmol/min/μg, was then accepted as the measured specific activity of rhchst <dig> 

to make sure that rhchst <dig> was stable over the time, a product-time plot was also conducted . in this experiment, the amount of enzyme was fixed at  <dig>  ng, but reaction time varied from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes. the enzyme showed a good linear product-time course , indicating that the enzyme was stable over the time. this result therefore validated the  <dig> minute reaction time used in previous experiments.

assay examples
sds-page based sulfotransferase assay has been successfully applied to all sulfotransferases that are available to us thus far. to further illustrate the versatility of this method, we describe the assays of several other representative sulfotransferases using different acceptor substrates. to avoid redundancy, only data directly showing specific activity are presented here .

tpst <dig> assay using psgl- <dig> peptide as the acceptor
tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase  transfers sulfates to the p-selectin glycoprotein ligand- <dig>  on myeloid cells and stimulated t lymphocytes and plays a critical role in the tethering of these cells to activated platelets or endothelia that express p-selectin  <cit> . recombinant human tpst <dig>  was assayed using  <dig>  pmol of acceptor substrate psgl- <dig> peptide and  <dig>  pmol of paps in at 37°c for  <dig> minutes. enzyme linear response region was located from  <dig> to  <dig> ng of enzyme input. under these conditions, the specific activity was determined to be  <dig>  pmol/min/μg .

chst <dig> assay using chondroitin sulfate as the acceptor
carbohydrate sulfotransferases  <dig> , also known as chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase, catalyzes the sulfation at the 6-o position of the n-acetylgalactosamine  residues on chondroitin sulfate  <cit> . in this example, assay was done using  <dig>  pmol of paps and  <dig> μg of bovine chondroitin sulfate as the acceptor substrate. other assay conditions were the same as those of rhchst <dig>  under these conditions, recombinant human chst <dig>  showed a specific activity of  <dig> pmol/min/μg .

hs6st <dig> assay using recombinant human syndecan- <dig> as the acceptor
heparan sulfate 6-o sulfotransferase  <dig>  transfers sulfate to the 6-o position of glcnac residues on heparan sulfate  <cit> . to assay hs6st <dig>  recombinant human syndecan  <dig>  a known heparan sulfate proteoglycan, was used as the acceptor substrate. each reaction was conducted with  <dig> μg of acceptor substrate and  <dig>  pmol of paps in the presence of  <dig>  mg/ml protamine. other assay conditions were the same as those of rhchst <dig>  under these conditions, recombinant human hs6st <dig>  showed a specific activity of  <dig> pmol/min/μg . this experiment also proved that the recombinant syndecans  <dig> carried functional heparan sulfate.

relative mobility of a small molecule to paps
it is clear that the ability of sds-page to separate both large molecules, such as recombinant syndecans  <dig>  and small molecules, such as paps, is essential to the current assay systems. while it is known that protein separation in sds-page is mainly due to differences in molecular size, the separation of small molecules during electrophoresis is not well studied. to see whether a small molecule can be separated from paps and be applicable to the current assay method, we defined ideal mobility  as the speed that the small molecule travels in a constant electric field without any resistance. according to this definition, the following equation was derived ,   

q, charge; m, mass; e, electric field strength; t, running time.

eq. <dig> indicates that the mobility of a small molecule under ideal conditions is dependent on electric field strength, running time, and, q/m ratio. for all molecules in a same electrophoresis, electric field strength and running time are always the same, but the q/m ratios are unique to the molecules. in order to have a more convenient term for sulfotransferase assay, we further defined relative mobility  of a small molecule as the ratio of its mobility to that of paps .   

since the charge and mass of paps  under defined conditions are constant, m' of a small molecule is only dependent on its own q/m ratio. the value of m' suggests whether the molecule can be separated from paps during electrophoresis. the estimated relative mobilities of some small molecules encountered in this report are listed in table  <dig>  because most of the sulfated small molecules have estimated relative mobilities less than  <dig>  meaning that they move slower than paps in an electrophoresis, these molecules are likely to be applicable to sds-page based sulfotransferase assay.

anumbers of sulfate groups are indicated as -ns.

bthe charge numbers on the molecules were estimated based on the numbers of their charged groups, such as -coo-, -nh3+ and -so3-. because some functional groups were partially charged due to the influence of other neighboring functional groups, the corresponding charge number and relative mobility were only estimation.

cassuming the -nh3+ on mono-sulfated dopamine  is completely protonated at ph  <dig> .

dassuming the amine group on the di-sulfated dopamine can only partially protonated, because the two negatively charged sulfate groups could shift the pka of the -nh3+ closer to  <dig> .

e fully charged paps would have a charge number of -4; however, under the assay conditions, paps could be partially charged and the charge number - <dig> was assumed here. the most similar molecule, atp, can exist in mgatp2-, atp4- and atp3- species  <cit>  and overall charge number could be close to - <dig> too.

fbromophenol blue has about half of the mobility of paps and is used as an indicator during electrophoresis.

estimated relative mobility correlated well with observed mobility
to see how the estimated relative mobilities correlate to the actual relative mobilities for the small molecules listed in table  <dig> and further prove that this electrophoresis based assay can be applied to these small molecules, we sulfated corresponding small molecule substrates using sult1a <dig>  sult1e <dig>  sult2a <dig> and chst <dig>  and then separated the reactions on an 8% sds gel . except the reaction for sult1a1/dopamine where two products were observed, one product resulted in other reactions.

according to the definition of mobility, the relative mobility of a small molecule should also be equal to the ratio of the distance that it travels  and the distance that paps travels , i.e.   

the distances of the products and paps traveled in figure  <dig> were then measured and the observed relative mobilities of these products were obtained . the observed values were in the range of ±  <dig>  of the estimated values.

the slow and fast moving bands in the sult1a1/dopamine reaction  are likely due to mono- and di-sulfated dopamine respectively, because their observed relative mobilities correlate well with the estimated relative mobilities for mono- and di-sulfated dopamine respectively. while paps was almost completely consumed in some reactions , significant amount of paps remained in other reactions . in each reaction, paps was consumed by enzymatic sulfation, the rate of which was determined by enzyme kinetics, as well as degradation, which was evidenced by the presence of free sulfate in each reaction. it was to our advantage to leave some paps unconsumed so that we could determine the relative mobilities of the products.

discussion
we have developed a sulfotransferase assay in which the separation of sulfated products and donor substrate paps is achieved using electrophoresis. in each sulfotransferase assay, an activity-enzyme plot was first obtained to locate the linear response region; a second experiment was then performed within this linear region. the specific activity of the enzyme was the slope of the linear regression equation that was obtained upon the second activity-enzyme plot. normally, the linear response region was within low percentage of paps consumption  to avoid the buildup of the side products including 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate  and adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate . pap is reported to be a potent inhibitor to several sulfotransferases  <cit> . the affect of aps to the assay is less clear and the buildup of aps was only seen in aged paps preparation. because sulfotransferase activities are also highly dependent on substrate concentrations due to normal enzyme kinetics and substrate inhibitions that are unique to some of the sulfotransferases  <cit> , all initial substrate inputs were specified in each assay.

this electrophoresis based sulfotransferase assay can be applied to substrates as small as α-naphthol and as large as recombinant proteoglycans. this versatility comes from that sds-page can separate large proteins and small molecules based on different parameters. separation of proteins, including proteoglycans, is largely based on size. separation of small molecules is largely based on q/m ratio. for cases where small molecules are used as acceptor substrates, the estimated relative mobility of a sulfated product to paps can be used to predict whether the molecule is suitable for electrophoresis-based sulfotransferase assay.

the estimated relative mobility correlated better with the observed values for molecules with defined charge numbers, such as dhea-1s and glcnac-man-1s, than the molecules with uncertain charge numbers, such as dopamine-2s and lithocholic acid-1s . this uncertainty was because of the unknown protonation states of some functional groups that were influenced by neighboring functional groups. a much larger deviation of the estimated relative mobility from the observed relative mobility was observed for free sulfate, which may be due to much stronger counter-ion interaction during electrophoresis.

although the current method was developed based on assaying various purified recombinant sulfotransferases, it could be applied to assaying enzyme mixture that contains multiple sulfotransferases, as long as the enzymes are specific for different substrates. for example, if an extract contains both hs6st <dig> and galnac4s6s, we can first assay hs6st <dig> activity with heparan sulfate as the acceptor, and then assay galnac4s6s activity with chondroitin sulfate a as the acceptor. in general, when a certain type of glycosaminoglycan is used as acceptor, the position of the introduced sulfate is determined by the specificity of the sulfotransferase. however, it is hard to determine the exact sugar residues on a glycosaminoglycan chain that the sulfate is introduced into. to do that, we need more sophisticate methods, such as stable isotope labeling with mass spectrometry analysis  <cit> .

the current electrophoresis-based assay offers several advantages. first, this method allows processing multiple samples simultaneously; therefore it is amenable to inhibitor screening and drug development. although the current format using standard polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis apparatus is kind of cumbersome, it is possible to miniaturize the systems by taking advantage of scientific advances, such as nanotechnology, and to make the system high-throughput in a similar way that dna sequencing technology was transformed from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis based method. second, it easily separates mono-sulfated and di-sulfated small molecule products, as suggested in the reaction with dopamine and sult1a <dig>  although mono-sulfated dopamine with sulfation at either 3-o or 4-o position was reported previously  <cit> , di-sulfated dopamine containing both 3-o and 4-o sulfates has not been reported, probably due to the difficult on separating the two species using traditional methods. the observation of di-sulfated dopamine demonstrates how flexible the substrate binding site of sult1a <dig> is  <cit> . third, the electrophoresis-based assay is so versatile that it has been successfully applied to all kinds of substrates that have been tested so far. these substrates include proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, oligosaccharides and various phenolic small molecules. finally, because sulfation is biochemically most similar to phosphorylation, it can be reasonably assumed that this method is applicable to kinase assay as well.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated the versatility of page-based sulfotransferase assay with several representative enzymes, which include carbohydrate and tyrosylprotein specific sulfotransferases. small molecule specific sulfotransferases such as sult1a <dig> can be assayed as long as the sulfated product has different mobility than the donor substrate paps. a method for predicting whether a sulfotransferase can be assayed with the current method has also been provided.
