BACKGROUND
collagen is the most abundant protein found in animals. it has been used widely for industrial and medical applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering  <cit> . human type i collagen is the most abundant collagen type in the human body and is also one of the most studied collagen types. it is a heterotrimer composed of two α <dig>  and one α <dig>  chains with the helical region composed by a repeating composition of xaa-yaa-gly, where x and y are typically proline  and hydroxyproline   <cit> . collagens used commercially are traditionally extracted from animal tissues. these products contain different types of collagen and may be contaminated with potential immunogenic and infective agents considered hazardous to human health. thus, recombinant technology has been developed to produce high quality and animal derived contaminant-free collagens. recombinant collagens have been produced in mammalian cells  <cit> , insect cell cultures  <cit> , yeast  <cit> , and plant cell culture  <cit> .

transgenic plant systems have advantages over other recombinant production systems in terms of lower cost, higher capacity, lower infective agents/toxins contamination risk, and inexpensive storage capability facilitating processing  <cit> . the production of plant derived recombinant collagen i α- <dig>  was reported in  <dig> using tobacco  <cit>  and tobacco cell culture  <cit> . the rciα <dig> was also expressed in transgenic maize seed  <cit>  and barley  <cit> .

a challenge for producing rciα <dig> in non-mammalian expression systems such as transgenic plants is the resulting low regioselective hydroxyproline content that makes the product unstable at physiologically relevant temperatures. in humans the 4-hydroxyproline residues synthesized by prolyl 4-hydroxylases  as a posttranslational modification increase the stability of the collagen triple helix structure  <cit> . the stability of the collagen is increased with the presence of the hydroxyproline primarily through stereoelectronic effects  <cit> . on the other hand, the hydroxyproline content for the rciα <dig> is almost zero in transgenic tobacco  <cit> , or very low in transgenic maize  <cit>  when rciα <dig> is not co-expressed with p4h. since the insect, microbial and plant endogenous p4hs are not able to achieve the same level of hydroxylation of rciα <dig> as present in the human ciα <dig> chain, the co-expression with collagen of a recombinant animal p4h  is necessary to increase the hydroxyproline content of the rciα <dig> to deliver a stable product. in tobacco, co-expression of p4h with an α subunit from c. elegans and a β subunit from mouse  <cit>  or a recombinant human p4h  <cit>  led to increased hydroxyproline levels of the rciα <dig>  similar results were seen in tobacco cell culture  <cit> . however, the tobacco-derived collagen still had lower hyp content compared to native human ciα <dig> making this product unsuitable for use in many applications.

in this study, we generated transgenic maize lines expressing the human rciα <dig> gene alone or lines co-expressing both rciα <dig> and rp4h genes. using high-resolution mass spectrometry  analysis, we measured the percentages of hyp and pro residues in the rciα <dig> protein extracted from transgenic maize seeds as well as the actual positions of hydoxylated prolines. we also performed in vitro pepsin treatment at different temperatures to compare the thermal stabilities of maize-derived hydroxylated or non-hydroxylated rciα <dig> proteins. here, we report for the first time that by co-expressing rp4h genes, maize can produce rciα <dig> with a hydroxyproline content comparable to native human type i collagen. this achievement provides further confirmation that maize seeds can be used to produce exogenous proteins that require mammalian-like posttranslational modifications for use in specific applications.

RESULTS
generation of maize lines expressing rciα <dig> with and without rp4h co-expression in seeds
the constructs used in this study are shown in figure  <dig>  the cgb construct carries a gene encoding a recombinant full-length human collagen type i, rciα <dig>  and the cgd construct carries the rciα <dig> gene and both α and β subunits of recombinant human prolyl 4-hydroxylase, rp4hα and rp4hβ. the rciα <dig> gene was partially maize codon-optimized and its expression was driven by a maize embryo specific globulin- <dig> promoter . a barley alpha amylase signal sequence  was used as a substitute for the human ciα <dig> signal peptide . the combination of embryo specific promoter and the baass has demonstrated high expression of foreign proteins in maize seed  <cit> . the rciα <dig> gene lacks the n-propeptide but contains the telopeptide sequences both at the n and c terminal regions. a  <dig> amino acid bacteriophage t <dig> fibritin foldon peptide sequence  <cit>  was fused at the c-terminus to the rciα <dig> replacing the c-propeptide. the foldon, as the native c-propeptide, facilitates the rciα <dig> triple-helical assembly and enhances its stability  <cit> . to avoid undesired dna rearrangement caused by using identical sequences , we chose to use the maize ubiquitin promoter  to drive the expression of α and β subunits of rp4h. it was shown previously that there is a preferential accumulation of recombinant protein in germ tissue using the ubiquitin promoter  <cit> .

both constructs were introduced into maize hi ii germplasm using immature embryo via an agrobacterium-based transformation system. twelve independent transgenic events for cgb and  <dig> events for cgd, respectively, were recovered and brought to maturity in the greenhouse using pollen donors from an elite inbred. initial transgene expression screens were conducted on both callus and t <dig> seeds using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  to detect the expression of rciα <dig>  and α and β subunits of rp4h. t <dig> seeds from events with the highest transgene expressions were produced by self pollination.

for t <dig> seed analysis, seeds from multiple plants derived from each event were analysed. in depth molecular and biochemical characterizations of rciα <dig> described in this study were performed on t <dig> seeds from one selected cgb and cgd event, respectively. individual seeds of the transgenic events were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction  to separate transgene positive seeds from negative ones. positive seeds were pooled and analyzed by elisa for the expression of the rciα <dig>  negative null segregant seeds were used as controls.

the average expression level of rciα <dig> measured by elisa in event cgb was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g of total soluble protein  or  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/kg of dry seed weight . the highest rciα <dig> content measured to date from a single cgb seed was  <dig>  mg/g tsp or  <dig>  mg/kg dsw. the average expression level of the rciα <dig> in event cgd was about four times lower than that of in event cgb, which was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g tsp or  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/kg dsw. the highest rciα <dig> expression in single cgd seed was  <dig>  mg/g tsp or  <dig>  mg/kg dsw.

the expression of the β subunit of rp4h in the cgd seeds was verified by western blotting with an anti p4hβ monoclonal antibody . a main band at ~ <dig> kd  was detected in cgd, but not in cgb and non-transgenic wild type maize control, as expected. a weak secondary band detected in cgd is likely due to cross-reactivity of other forms of rp4hβ in maize. the detection of α subunit of p4h was performed in transgenic callus but not in seeds .

to determine whether rciα <dig> can also be detected in tissues other than seeds, we performed both protein and transcript analyses of rciα <dig> in cgb and cgd plants. maize leaf samples from  <dig> different development stages were collected. total rna and proteins were prepared from these tissues and subjected to reverse transcriptase pcr  and elisa, respectively. no detectable rciα <dig> transcript and protein could be observed in these samples , suggesting that the rciα <dig> is not expressed in leaf tissue in both lines as expected.

co-expression of rp4h increases the hydroxylation of rciα1
to examine the percentage and positions of the prolines that were hydroxylated by the co-expression of rp4h in the cgd event, we carried out proteomics analysis of gel purified rciα <dig> using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  on the linear ion trap orbitrap  mass spectrometer, a high resolution mass spectrometry . the hrms not only can verify the amino acid sequence of the rciα <dig>  but also can identify the positions of hydroxylated proline residues . in addition to maize-derived rciα <dig> proteins from cgb and cgd, we also included three control samples: gel isolated ciα <dig> fragment from human collagen , pichia-derived rciα <dig>  and pichia-derived hydroxylated rciα <dig>  .

results are summarized in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  the protein sequence coverage by the hrms  on the five samples ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . to compare the percentages and positions of hyp in each sample, we chose the peptide regions in all five ciα <dig> proteins  that were covered by the hrms . the common peptide regions represent  <dig> % of the full-length ciα <dig> sequence . a total of  <dig> pro and hyp out of  <dig> total amino acids  were identified by the hrms in all samples .

for two maize-derived ciα <dig> samples, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> hyp were identified from cgb and cgd , respectively, representing a hyp percentage of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, for these two lines . this result indicates that the co-expression of rp4h in maize can greatly enhance the hydroxylation of prolines on collagen molecules. the increased number of hyp in rciα <dig> from cgd samples may partially contributed to the increased molecular weight and thereby decreased the migration rate .

because rp4h catalyzes hydroxylation of pro residues in the yaa position of the xaa-yaa-gly triplets within collagen strands  <cit> , we further compared the pro residues on all xaa-pro-gly triplets in both maize cgb and cgd lines. hrms analysis identified  <dig> aa  from maize-rciα <dig>  and  <dig> aa  from maize rciα1-oh  as shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig> . among these hrms identified aa, we chose  <dig> aa that were shared for both cgb and cgd. we further identified a total of  <dig> sets of collagenous triplets within the  <dig> aa. among the  <dig> sets of triplets,  <dig> sets  have the pro residues changed to hyp  in both cgb and cgd lines;  <dig> sets  have the pro unchanged  in both lines. on the other hand,  <dig> sets of triplets  have the pro residues changed to hyp  only in rciα <dig> isolated from cgd, indicating that nearly half of the collagenous triplets were posttranslationally modified by the co-expression of rp4h genes in cgd maize line.

seventy-one hyp residues out of  <dig> aa by hrms  were identified in human ciα <dig> control sample . for pichia samples, while only two hyp residues  were found in non-hydroxylated ciα <dig> ,  <dig> hyp residues  were found in hydroxylated ciα <dig> , indicating that the co-expression of p4h in pichia had also dramatically increased proline hydroxylation in collagen .

co-expression of rp4h enhances the thermal stability of rciα1
to further characterize the maize-derived rciα <dig> and rciα1-oh, we carried out thermal stability analysis using pepsin digestion at 10°c for  <dig> minutes after heat treatment of protein samples at 4°c or temperatures ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> °c for  <dig> minutes. the proteolytic resistance of maize-derived collagens were compared with that of the native human collagen and the recombinant collagen from pichia pastoris. figure 5a is a western blot results showing the proteolytic resistance of the collagens after 4°c heat treatment using anti-foldon antibody. both non-hydroxylated rciα <dig> from maize  and non-hydroxylated rciα <dig> from pichia  were not detected after pepsin treatment. by contrast, the hydroxylated rciα <dig> could be detected from both maize  and hydroxylated-ciα <dig> pichia  samples, suggesting that the pepsin digestion resistance of these collagens was associated with the higher percentage of hyp residues.

the thermal stability of rciα <dig> was further characterized by the determination of melting temperature  using western analysis. two different antibodies, anti-foldon and anti- <dig> kd collagen, were used. in our hands, anti-foldon antibody gave results with less non-specific cross-reactive background bands, while anti- <dig> kd antibody appeared to be more sensitive. because the native human ciα <dig> can only be detected with anti- <dig> kd antibody, we used both antibodies in this study. in the experiments shown in figure 5b, maize seeds tsp from cgb and cgd were extracted and concentrated as described above. the quantities of maize-derived rciα <dig> were estimated by elisa. approximately 50- <dig> ng/reaction of rciα <dig> from cgb and cgd were used for pepsin treatment. as a control, commercial human collagen  was spiked into tsp extracted from non-transgenic maize seed for pepsin treatment. as can be seen in figure 5b, both maize-derived rciα <dig>  and rciα1-oh  were as stable as the human collagen control at all temperatures tested in the absence of pepsin. when digested with pepsin, the maize-derived non-hydroxylated rciα <dig>  was degraded after the heat treatment at temperatures as low as 4°c. on the other hand, the hydroxylated rciα1-oh  could still be detected after temperature treatment as high as 35°c when using anti-foldon antibody, and  <dig> °c when using anti- <dig> kd antibody. the difference in tm results was likely due to the sensitivity and epitope recognition sites of two types of antibodies. interestingly, the control native human collagen could only withstand the digestion upto temperature treatment around 31°c. this observation is in fact in agreement with the hrms analysis of the collagens described in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  because the maize-derived rciα1-oh has higher hyp percentage  than that from human collagen control , it is expected that the increased hyp residues could help to increase the thermal stability of the collagen molecules.

discussion
the production of plant-derived recombinant collagens have been reported in tobacco leaves, barley cell culture and seeds, as well as maize seeds as summarized in table  <dig>  previous tobacco-derived rciα <dig> studies showed that different combinations of recombinant human collagens  were used to improve the production of homotrimeric or heterotrimeric recombinant human type i collagen  <cit> . in a recent paper, stein et al  <cit>  achieved a high expression level of  <dig> mg/kg fresh leaves by expressing the collagens under a chrysanthemum rbcs <dig> promoter and vacuolar-targeting signal sequence. early work with tobacco-derived collagens had very low levels of hyp . with co-expression of c. elegans p4hα/mouse p4hβ  <cit>  or the human rp4hα/β  <cit> , hyp levels were increased to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. however, this enhanced hyp level in tobacco is still lower than that of native human collagen ciα <dig>  which is reported as  <dig> % by amino acid analysis  <cit>  or around 15% by the hrms analysis .

both the full length and a smaller fragment  of rciα <dig> were produced in barley cell culture  <cit>  and barley seeds  <cit> . the barley-derived  <dig> kd collagen has  <dig> % of hyp content when produced in seeds without co-expression of rp4h genes  <cit> .

previous work on fractionation, purification and characterization of maize-derived full length and a smaller fragment  of collagen suggested that an accumulation level of about  <dig> mg/kg  and of  <dig> mg/kg  of dsw, respectively  <cit> . a similar maize line accumulating the full length rciα <dig> producing maize line  was used in this study. in our case, the collagen yield of the rciα <dig> accumulating line without p4h co-expression averages  <dig> mg/kg dsw, while the rciα <dig> accumulating line with p4h co-expression  is about  <dig> mg/kg. the hyp percentage in rciα <dig> protein of cgb was reported as  <dig> % using total amino acid composition  analysis  <cit> ; however, it was measured at  <dig> % by using hrms analysis in our study. similarly, the hyp percentage in human ciα <dig> was reported as  <dig> % using aac analysis  <cit> . in our hrms analysis, the hyp for human ciα <dig> measured around 15%. it is not clear why hyp percentages of ciα <dig> proteins measured uniformly higher in hrms analysis than that of in aac analysis. this discrepancy is likely due to the different degrees of resolution of these two very different methodologies. because the concentrations of rciα <dig> and rciα1-oh obtained from maize seeds were too low to be measured by aac analysis in our study, we were not able to obtain aac analysis results for comparison.

p4h is an enzyme that regioselectively modifies the pro residues in collagenous triplets xaa-pro-gly  <cit>  in the er as a posttranslational modification. compared to the pichia recombinant protein production system, maize can produce hydroxylated rciα <dig> with a comparable hyp percentage . interestingly, rciα <dig> produced in maize seems to have a higher base-level hyp percentage when compared to rciα <dig> isolated from pichia with no rp4h co-expression . small numbers of proline at both xaa and yaa positions got hydroxylated in cgb maize line without the co-expression of p4h . it is likely that the rciα <dig> produced in maize is also a substrate for plant endogenous p4hs with lower efficiency  <cit> .

conversely, the expression of human rp4h in maize may also catalyze hydroxylation of pro residues in any plant endogenous proteins with collagenous domains. we checked amino acid sequences of three abundant seed storage proteins  in maize and did not find any collagenous triplets . therefore we do not expect any pro to hyp modifications on these seed storage protein in the rp4h expressing cgd line. in fact, the hyp-only aac analysis on both cgb and cgd seeds showed no differences in hyp contents . however, because both α and β subunits of rp4h were under the control of the constitutive ubiquitin promoter, it is possible that any of the collagenous triplet domains on proteins in plant cells can be modified by rp4h in such transgenic lines. it may be desirable in the future to restrict rp4h expression to seed tissue only using seed specific promoters.

using hrms to analyze posttranslational modification has obvious advantages such as low protein quantity requirement, free of contaminating proteins in samples and reading accuracy. however, it does not give 100% coverage. in this study the peptide coverage ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

because posttranslational modification is a continuous process in the cells, the collagen isolated from the seeds represents a population of protein molecules, i.e., the proline hydroxylation may vary from one collagen molecule to another. in fact, we have performed multiple hrms measurements on samples extracted from same batch of seeds. we found that while positions of pro to hyp modification may vary between measurements, the overall hyp content remained constant between these samples.

the thermal stability tests in this report showed that maize-derived rciα1-oh could still be detected after pepsin digestion followed by heat treatment as high as 35°c  and  <dig> °c . commercial human collagen control undergoing the same treatment could only withstand up to 31°c temperatures. stein et al  <cit>  reported that the melting temperatures for their tobacco-derived collagen heterotrimer and human skin collagen samples were around 39°c. high melting temperature of plant-derived collagen could potentially be useful for certain industrial application where higher melting temperature is desired, for example, biomaterials for tissue engineering  <cit> .

we recovered the maize-derived rciα <dig> from the seed total soluble proteins using a previously described protocol  <cit> . because collagens are acid soluble proteins, the extraction buffer used had a ph of  <dig> . unlike zhang et al.  <cit> , we did not perform extensive purification for rciα <dig> before gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis. when treating such acidic rciα <dig> solutions under high temperature as we normally do before loading protein gels, we were unable to detect them in western blot, suggesting that the combination of acidic buffer and high temperature could be detrimental to collagen integrity. therefore in this study, all maize-derived rciα <dig> samples in acidic solutions were not boiled prior to western blot analysis to avoid collagen degradation.

it is interesting to note that both maize- and pichia-derived non-hydroxylated rciα <dig> were completely digested by pepsin at 10°c after the temperature treatment of samples at 4°c in our study . this result is different from what was reported in barley  <cit>  and maize  <cit> , in which plant- and pichia-derived rciα <dig> were still detectable after the heat treatment of 26-27°c. this could be attributed to the different pepsin treatment protocols used in the experiments. for example, the pepsin experiments reported by zhang et al <cit>  were conducted under ph  <dig>  with a  <dig> minutes heat treatment followed by  <dig> μg/ml pepsin digestion at 4°c for 16- <dig> hr. ritala et al <cit>  conducted the heat treatment for  <dig> min before subjecting the samples to  <dig> μg/ml pepsin digestion at 10°c for  <dig> min under an acidic condition. our conditions were similar to ritala et al except that we used  <dig> μg/ml pepsin for  <dig> min under ph  <dig> . because pepsin functions best in acidic environment, our pepsin digestion under low ph is likely leading to the degradation of non-hydroxylated rciα <dig> even at 4°c. another explanation could be the quantity of the collagen substrate used in different experiments. we estimated that approximately 50- <dig> ng/reaction of unpurified rciα <dig> from cgb seeds were subjected to pepsin digestion in our study. however, zhang et al used about  <dig> -  <dig> ng purified rciα <dig> per reaction in their study  <cit> . the quantity of collagen for pepsin digestion in ritala et al <cit>  was not specified.

we have demonstrated for the first time that mammalian-like hydroxylation of human rciα <dig> can be achieved in transgenic maize co-expressed with a human rp4h. the hyp content in maize-derived hydroxylated rciα <dig> is comparable to that of the native human version, leading to a similar thermal stability of the product. the current expression levels of collagen reported here are too low for large scale production, as desired accumulation level of recombinant proteins for commercial production is estimated between  <dig> to  <dig> mg/kg grain  <cit> . further improvement of recombinant protein production in plants can be achieved by optimization of gene expression including using more effective regulatory elements and protein targeting/retention sequences, as well as using conventional breeding program to select high expression lines over generations  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have shown that properly hydroxylated recombinant human collagen i alpha  <dig>  can be produced in maize seed. by co-expressing recombinant human prolyl 4-hydroxylases , we have successfully produced rciα <dig> containing hyp residue levels that are comparable to native human ciα <dig>  the increased hyp content is associated with increased thermal stability in maize-derived rciα <dig>  application of high-resolution mass spectrometry  allowed us to measure hydroxylated prolines at specific amino acid positions in different samples. our findings indicate that maize seed can be used as a system to produce recombinant proteins requiring mammalian-like posttranslational modifications.
