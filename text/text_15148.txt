BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most frequent polymorphism in the genomes of animals and plants. next-generation sequencing  technologies are able to produce millions of short sequence reads in a high-throughput, cost-effective fashion and thus can be used for de novo sequencing and resequencing of genomes. when coupled with the barcoded multiplexed sequencing strategies  <cit> , these technologies can be amended to carry out high-throughput snp discovery and genotyping for a large number of samples simultaneously for whole-genome association studies to identify genes involved in complex genetic traits  <cit> . all these studies inevitably need a high-quality reference genome sequence for the alignment of genomic sequences of different individuals to call snps and genotypes. however, resequencing is currently not feasible for snp discovery in the majority of crop species, especially those with large, polyploidy genomes such as oilseed rape, cotton, bread wheat and sugarcane, due to lack of a high-quality reference genome sequence and the existence of large amount of homoeologous sequences. in polyploid crops, for example brassica napus l., the presence of two sub-genomes  makes snp discovery and genotyping more challenging because homologous and homoeologous dna sequences from the two sub-genomes have to be analyzed simultaneously. two classes of dna polymorphisms, inter-variety polymorphisms  and inter-homoeologue polymorphisms , are usually mixed together. in addition, the original a and c genomes are already duplicated or triplicated as a result of ancestral polyploidization events  <cit> , which further complicates the discovery and genotyping of snps in b. napus <cit> .

to overcome the complexity of genomes and improve genotyping through-put, approaches such as complexity reduction of polymorphic sequences , restriction-site-associated dna sequencing  and genotyping by sequencing  that coupled reduced representation libraries  with ngs technologies have been developed  <cit>  and extensively used to sequence a similar subset of restriction fragments from multiple individuals for accurate snp discovery and genotyping at low cost  <cit> . recently double digestion radseq  and double digestion gbs  were developed to simplify the procedure and reduce the cost of rrl construction  <cit> . at the same time, several bioinformatics approaches and tools have been developed for snp discovery with reduced representation sequencing data in species without a reference genome sequence. in turkey, sequence reads from rrls were de novo assembled into contigs, which subsequently served as a reference sequence to which all short reads derived from multiple individuals were mapped accurately  <cit> . stacks and radtools have been developed for snp discovery and genotyping in several species  <cit> . but these tools were not specifically developed for snp discovery in polyploid species such as oilseed rape and bread wheat, and thus could not effectively discriminate allelic variations from polymorphisms among homoeologous sequences. to date, no computational tool has the ability to unambiguously and efficiently discriminate snps from homoeologous sequence differences when both copies of the two homoeologous genomes are being sampled.

in this study, we employed a modified ddradseq approach to sequence the reduced representation genomes of the two parents, zy <dig> and no <dig>  and the bnanzdh population derived from these two parents in deep coverage for snp discovery and genotyping. we also developed a bioinformatics pipeline termed rfaptools to unambiguously discriminate between snps versus differences of homoeologous sequences in polyploid crops such as oilseed rape without a reference genome sequence. a pseudo-reference sequence  was built using the sequence reads from the parents and their segregating dh population. by aligning sequence reads of each individual dh line to the prf, both allelic snp and presence/absence variations  were discovered and genotyped.

RESULTS
distribution of in silico ddrad tags in genome of b. napus
a modified ddradseq protocol was used to construct rrls for zy <dig> and no <dig>  and their  <dig> dh progenies . genomic dna was double-digested with restriction enzymes  saci and msei, and fragments in a size range of 141–420 bp were recovered. libraries from  <dig> different individuals tagged with  <dig> barcodes were pooled and sequenced on illumina gaiix or hiseq <dig> platforms. zy <dig> and no <dig> yielded  <dig>  and  <dig>  million pe reads respectively. the  <dig> dh individuals yielded a total of  <dig>  million pe reads, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million reads in different dhs with an average of  <dig>  million reads per dh line .

to estimate the number of saci-msei fragments generated with ddradseq in the b. napus genome, we did in silico double digestion of the b. rapa chromosome a <dig>  as a representative with the same restriction enzymes and obtained  <dig>  saci-msei fragments within the size range of 141–420 bp. the distance between every two adjacent in silico sequence tags on the b. rapa a <dig> reference sequence was calculated. the majority  of adjacent in silico tags were located within less than 25 kb, with  <dig> % tags within 5 kb  and  <dig> % within 5–10 kb . only  <dig> % adjacent tags were located 40 kb apart from each other. the average distance between two adjacent saci-msei fragments was about  <dig>  kb. we further analyzed the distribution of saci-msei tags along the b. rapa a <dig> reference sequence in a sliding window of 250 kb . the number of saci-msei tags varied from  <dig> to  <dig> in every 250 kb window. the distribution of in silico tags along the b. rapa a <dig> reference sequence indicated that the target fragments were evenly and randomly distributed in the brassica genome.

the cumulative length of all in silico saci-msei fragments within the size range of 141–420 bp was  <dig>  bp. thus the genomic complexity should have been reduced by 33-fold . the total genome size of b. napus is estimated to be  <dig>  gb  <cit> . according to the in silico simulation and assuming that b. rapa and b. napus had similar gc content, genomic reduction with saci and msei double digestion should result in ~36 mb of dna or about  <dig>  saci-msei fragments in the size range of 141–420 bp for sequencing, which is equivalent to about  <dig> % of the b. napus genome. the above analyses suggested that the modified ddradseq could significantly reduce the genome complexity of b. napus and also result in a considerably large number of target fragments for snp discovery at the same time.

snp genotyping in dh population and linkage map construction
snp calling is usually performed by aligning short reads of one or more individuals to a high-quality reference genome using soap, maq or other software  <cit> . currently, there is no such high-quality reference genome sequence and no computational tool available for b. napus to differentiate allelic snps from the abundant ihps. to address these challenges, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline named rfaptools that included three modules: assembly of a pseudo-reference sequence, snp discovery and genotyping, and discrimination of allelic snps from homoeologous loci . firstly, a pseudo-reference sequence was assembled using sequencing reads from the parents and dhs as described in the method section. the pseudo-reference sequence contained a total of  <dig>  sequence tags, including  <dig>  sequence tags specific to no <dig>  which was very close to the above prediction.

calling of snp genotypes was done by aligning all sequence reads of the parents and individual dh to the pseudo-reference sequence using the soap software  <cit> . each allele of a complex locus with mixed sequence tags was scored in each parent and dh individual using rfaptools. then a co-occurrence matrix of all alleles at the complex locus was made. allelic variants were subsequently discriminated from homoeologous sequences based on the co-occurrence matrix with rfaptools . theoretically, a dh individual in a segregating dh population should be homozygous and a locus should only confer either allele from the two parents. with a threshold of 25% mmd  in the dh population, a total of  <dig>  simple snp loci  <cit>  containing  <dig>  snps were recovered. snps distributed evenly across the pe reads, with a slightly decrease to the ends mainly due to the base quality declined . of these snp loci,  <dig>   had one unique allele from each parent, while the other  <dig>  snp loci were mined from  <dig> or more mixed homoeologous or paralogous sequences, which had been scored as hemi-snps in transcriptome sequencing  <cit> . all the  <dig>  snp loci, together with  <dig> single-locus ssr loci as anchors to assign linkage groups  to specific chromosomes, were used for linkage map construction. a linkage map comprising of  <dig>  snp loci containing  <dig>  snps and  <dig> ssr loci was constructed using the mstmap software  <cit> . the linkage map contained  <dig> bins with an average density of  <dig>  loci per bin and covered a total length of  <dig> .0 cm, with  <dig>  loci mapped to the a sub-genome and  <dig>  loci to the c sub-genome . a <dig> was the smallest lg that spanned  <dig>  cm and comprised of  <dig> loci, and c <dig> was the largest lg that spanned  <dig>  cm with  <dig>  loci, which were consistent with previous linkage maps constructed with ssr markers  <cit> . all the information of the snp linkage map was listed in table  <dig> 

the number in the parenthesis represents the number of anchor ssr loci in this linkage group.

pav genotyping in dh population and linkage map construction
two millions of sequencing reads were estimated to have a coverage depth of  <dig> folds at each locus on average based on the number of sequence tags in the pseudo-reference sequence. thus we selected a subset of  <dig> dh lines, of which each comprised of about  <dig>  million sequencing reads for pav genotype calling. all pavs that were perfectly aligned to the pseudo-reference sequence and appeared more than  <dig> times in the  <dig> dh lines were called and transformed into genotypes for each individual. a total of  <dig>  dominant pav markers were identified.

to construct a linkage map with the dominant pav markers,  <dig> anchor snp loci with 10% mmd in the  <dig> dh lines were selected from the snp linkage map to form a skeleton map. a linkage map contained  <dig>  dominant pav loci was constructed with these anchor snp loci . the linkage map contained  <dig> bins with an average of  <dig>  pav markers in each bin and covered a total length of  <dig> .8 cm. of the dominant markers,  <dig>  were located in the a sub-genome and  <dig>  in the c sub-genome of b. napus. consistent with the snp genetic map, the largest and smallest linkage groups were c <dig>  and a <dig>  respectively. all information of the pav genetic map was listed in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

validation of snps and genotypes
to investigate the authenticity of identified snps, we randomly selected  <dig> snps that created or destroyed recognition sites of res  for validation of single nucleotide variations. pcr primers were designed to amplify the restriction fragments containing the snps. pcr products from the two parents were digested with the corresponding res. of the  <dig> snps,  <dig>  could be confirmed by digestion, while the other  <dig> did not yield the expected restriction fragments. we further sequenced pcr products of all  <dig> loci amplified from the two parents using the sanger sequencing method to further confirm these snps. all the  <dig> confirmed snps had the expected nucleotide variations, while the remaining  <dig> snps were a mixture of the expected allelic variations and homoeologous sequences. we also surveyed the  <dig> dh lines to validate the called snp genotypes using the above confirmed  <dig> snps. a total of  <dig>  genotypes were generated with an accuracy of  <dig> %, indicating that the genotypes called by aligning sequence reads to the pseudo-reference sequence were reliable. these results further revealed the complexity of b. napus genome, and also demonstrated the efficacy of rfaptools in discriminating allelic snps from homoeologous loci.

alignment of the snp and pav linkage map to the b. rapa reference genome
the sequences of all  <dig>  snp loci and  <dig>  pav loci mapped to lgs in the a sub-genome were aligned to the b. rapa reference genome sequence to validate the genetic linkage maps constructed in this study . if a locus was mapped to multiple paralogous positions in the b. rapa genome, only the location with the best hit was selected for collinearity analysis. alignments indicated that all a sub-genome lgs of these two linkage maps had good collinearity with the b. rapa reference genome sequence except for minor inconsistencies, suggesting that the a sub-genome is retained relatively intact in b. napus <cit>  despite extensive genome rearrangements such as insertions and deletions that have occurred following hybridization of the a and c genomes  <cit> . the inconsistencies between the snp linkage map and the b. rapa reference genome sequences such as regions on chromosome a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  may be caused by the existence of paralogous sequences, differences between b. rapa and b. napus genomes or misassembly of sequence scaffolds . for instance, the inconsistency involving  <dig> snp markers around  <dig>  cm on a <dig> was caused by possible misassembly of partial sequence within scaffold <dig> . the inconsistency from the  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm on a <dig> was caused by possible misassembly involved scaffold <dig>  scaffold <dig>  scaffold <dig> and scaffold <dig>  an inversion from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm involving  <dig> snp markers was observed on a <dig>  which corresponds to about  <dig>  mb of scaffold <dig> . similar results were also observed between the a sub-genome of b. napus and the b. rapa a genome using markers on the pav genetic map .

mapping unassembled and misassembled scaffolds to the b. rapa chromosomes
high-density genetic linkage maps are often used to assign sequence scaffolds or contigs generated by whole genome shotgun sequencing to chromosomes. the genome of b. rapa was sequenced using the solexa technology and  <dig> scaffolds comprised of  <dig>  mb draft genome sequence could be integrated to the b. rapa chromosomes  <cit> , while  <dig> scaffolds larger than 2 kb could not be assigned to specific b. rapa chromosomes. using the snp and pav high-density genetic maps, we were able to assign  <dig> unassembled scaffolds to specific b. rapa chromosomes . the assignment of a scaffold was declared only if two or more loci from the same or adjacent bins were mapped to the same scaffold and at least one snp or pav loci without paralogous sequences in b. rapa genome. scaffold <dig>  was the largest and assigned to a <dig> by  <dig> snp and  <dig> pav loci. scaffold <dig>  was the smallest and assigned to a <dig> by two adjacent pav loci. in addition, we also identified  <dig> instances of and eight instances of misordering of sequence scaffolds . for instance, scaffold <dig>  scaffold <dig>  scaffold <dig> and scaffold <dig> which correspond to a chromosome region from  <dig> to  <dig>  cm on a <dig>  were mis-ordered as revealed by a run of  <dig> snp and  <dig> pav markers , although we could not exclude the possibility of rearrangements in the a sub-genome of b. napus.

discussion
rrls have been extensively used for sequencing a number of individuals in species with a reference genome sequence  <cit> . methods for snp discovery and genotyping generally require mapping sequencing reads to a fully sequenced genome from the same or a very closely related species. the unavailability of the whole genome sequence of the complex allotetraploid b. napus makes it still a challenge to determine genetic differences among individuals, which drastically limits this economically important oil crop to benefit from ngs technology. therefore the development of a reference genome sequence is of high importance. in this study, we developed a pseudo-reference sequence using short reads both from the parents and the segregating dh individuals. sequence tags detected in the two parents were included in the pseudo-reference sequence. with the pseudo-reference sequence, we could discover snps in the unsequenced b. napus using the reference-based snp calling software such as soap that is solely developed for species having reference genome sequence. in addition, the pseudo-reference sequence constructed in this study could be used for any other studies such as genetic mapping and genome-wide association studies in b. napus using the same combination of restriction enzymes and library construction protocol.

in diploid species, it is relatively easy to call snps and genotypes because they do not have homoeologous sequences. but in polyploid species, the existence of homoeologous sequences makes it difficult to differentiate the allelic snps from the homoeologous and also paralogous sequence differences, because multiple sequence reads can align to the same genomic location or an individual sequence read can show significant alignment to multiple genomic locations. for these reasons, previous snp identification methods have utilized only the subset of sequence reads that can be mapped uniquely to a reference  <cit>  and discarded a significant percentage of otherwise mappable reads. b. napus is a recently formed polyploid originated from natural hybridization of the mesopolyploids b. rapa and b. oleracea, which contributed to the constituent a and c genomes, respectively. the ancestrally related segments of the progenitor a and c genomes are homoeologs and kept essentially intact in b. napus <cit> . therefore, polymorphisms detected from short reads in b. napus are a mixture of sequences at homoeologous loci, one corresponding to the a sub-genome homoeologue and the other to the c sub-genome homoeologue. thus it is problematic to analyze allelic snps in b. napus as it is difficult to differentiate snps from the much more abundant inter-homoeolog polymorphisms . in this study, we used two strategies in the rfaptools to solve these problems. the first strategy was to separate the homoeologous sequences that differed with even only one nucleotide into distinct loci on the pseudo-reference sequence. the second strategy was to use the segregation data of the dh population to judge which two of the mixed alleles were allelic. in a segregating dh population with only homozygous genotypes, each individual should have two identical alleles from either parent. if two different alleles appeared in one individual, they should come from different homoeologous loci. followed the segregation rule, we were able to distinguish allelic sequences from homoeologous sequences even just having one nucleotide variation between them using the integrated rfaptools. of the  <dig>  snp loci,  <dig>  were mined from a mixture of homoeologous sequences. in contrast, only  <dig> % snps could be identified in b. napus by aligning rnaseq reads to about  <dig>  unigenes collected from the brassica species  <cit> , indicating that rfaptools coupled with modified ddradseq procedure could efficiently differentiate allelic snps from homoeologous sequence differences in polyploid species.

many analyses of genetic variation using reduced representation sequencing only focused on discovery and genotyping snps  <cit> . however, structural variations are more than single-base-pair differences among individuals  <cit> . in whole genome resequencing, pavs are identified to be structural variations caused by insertions or deletions in some regions of the genome, which could be scored as dominant markers. here the pavs could be caused either by insertions/deletions, or by mutations at re recognition sites. thus they may not be really absent in the genome but could be scored as dominant markers. as revealed by aflp, pavs associated with genome structural variation and mutations at re recognition sites are highly abundant in brassica genome  <cit> . in this study,  <dig>  pavs were scored as dominant markers in dh individuals having sequencing reads higher than  <dig> × coverage depth at each locus. the number of pavs was much more than that of snps, which have not been identified in previous reduced representation sequencing reports  <cit> .

de novo sequencing of the b. napus genome is undergoing with the ngs technologies. assembly of short reads is a great challenge in such a complex genome and high-density sequence-based genetic maps can be a great help to assemble the sequence scaffolds to form integrated chromosomes. however, such a high-density linkage map that may aid in the ordering and anchoring of the sequence scaffolds or contigs is still lacking in the brassica species. in this study, the two high-density linkage maps were constructed, which allowed us to assign  <dig> previously unassigned scaffolds to the b. rapa chromosomes and identify  <dig> possible misassembly and  <dig> possible misordering sequence scaffolds. bancroft et al. identified  <dig> instances of misassembly of sequence scaffolds and a segmental rearrangement using a similar snp bin map  <cit> . therefore the two high-density linkage maps constructed in this study will be very useful for assignment and correction of sequence scaffolds in de novo sequencing of the a, c and ac genomes. furthermore, these maps also provide a platform for maker-assisted selection breeding, map-based gene cloning and comparative genomic research in brassica species.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we constructed reduced representation libraries  for two parents and their  <dig> dh progenies using a modified ddradseq technique. a bioinformatics pipeline termed rfaptools was developed for snps/pavs discovering and genotyping in polyploid species. using these tools, we constructed a snp bin map containing  <dig>  snp loci and one pav linkage map containing  <dig>  dominant loci. both linkage maps showed good collinearity with the b. rapa reference genome sequence. using these linkage maps, we assigned  <dig> unassembled sequence scaffolds to the b. rapa chromosomes, and also identified  <dig> instances of possible misassembly and  <dig> possible instances of mis-ordered sequence scaffolds. these results suggested that modified ddradseq procedure and the bioinformatics pipeline rfaptools developed here is a powerful tool to mine allelic snps from homoeologous sequences, therefore they are generally applicable in either diploid or polyploid species with or without a reference genome sequence.
