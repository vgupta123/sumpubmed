BACKGROUND
shiga toxin was discovered in shigella dysenteriae serotype  <dig> by kiyoshi shiga in  <dig>  <cit> . the cytotoxic effects of escherichia coli-produced shiga toxin on vero cells were first described  <dig> years ago  <cit> . a few years later, the toxin was closely associated with hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome  and other severe disease conditions  <cit> . shiga toxin producing e. coli have been implicated in food borne, waterborne and airborne outbreaks in studies all over the world  <cit> . much of the focus of identification and characterization of shiga toxin has been on e. coli o157:h <dig> strains, even though many cases of shiga toxin associated disease were caused by other serotypes of e. coli  <cit> . the toxin has also been observed in other bacterial genera, including citrobacter, enterobacter and acinetobacter  <cit> .

shiga toxin  <dig>  and shiga toxin  <dig>  are encoded on a lambdoid bacteriophage. stx <dig> is genetically and immunologically distinct from stx <dig>  showing 55–60% genetic and amino acid identity  <cit> . stx <dig> is very similar to the shiga toxin  found in shigella dysenteriae type  <dig>  <cit> . several variants of stx <dig>  and stx <dig>  have been described  <cit> . both stx <dig> and stx <dig> are compound toxins made up of one  <dig> kda a subunit and five identical  <dig>  kda b subunits <cit> . the b subunits form a pentameric hollow ring that encircles the carboxyl end of the a amino acid chain. the b subunits of stx <dig>  and most stx <dig> type toxin molecules bind to specific glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide  receptors in eukaryotic cell membranes. stx2e b subunits preferentially bind to globotetraosylceramide   <cit> , which allows the toxin to target different cell types. once bound, receptor mediated endocytosis produces toxin-containing vesicles that travel through the golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. the a subunit is then proteolytically cleaved into a <dig>  and a <dig> , but a <dig> and a <dig> remain covalently connected through a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues. when the cysteines are reduced, the catalytically active a <dig> enzyme cleaves a specific adenine from the 28s rrna of the 60s ribosomal subunit  <cit> . without this adenine, the gtp/elongation factor tu/amino acyl-trna complex is unable to associate properly with the ribosome. amino acid chain elongation is stopped, usually resulting in cell death.

shiga toxin was shown to have the same n-glycosidase depurinating enzymatic function and active site conformation found in another ribosomal inhibiting protein , ricin  <cit> . comparison of the crystal structures of stx from shigella dysenteriae  <cit>  and stx <dig> from e. coli  <cit>  showed that the active sites were similar to that of ricin. both ricin and shiga toxin are considered type ii rips because of the lectin property of the b subunit that allows the enzymatic a subunit to be internalized for access to the ribosome. abrin, modeccin, volkensin and viscumin are examples of other rips that use the same method of entry and mechanism of action  <cit> .

despite their similarities, stx <dig> and stx <dig> produce different degrees and types of tissue damage. enterohemorrhagic e. coli that produce stx <dig> are more likely to cause hemolytic uremic syndrome than are stx <dig> producers  <cit> . this could be due to accessibility of the active site, differences in the carboxyl end of the a subunit, or differences in binding affinities of the b subunit pentamer to gb <dig>  <cit> .

other studies have shown how different types of pathogenic e. coli and shigella have developed using multilocus sequence typing  of several housekeeping genes  <cit> , genomic hybridization by microarray  <cit>  and comparative genomic sequencing by microarray  <cit> . since shiga toxin is encoded on a mobilizable bacteriophage, we focused on the phylogenetic diversity of the gene rather that the bacterium that happens to carry it. in this study we compared shiga toxin gene nucleotide and amino acid sequences from twenty nine reference strains from the national food safety & toxicology center at michigan state university and twelve clinical isolates from the idaho department of health that contained one or both stx genes. the e. coli strains used are both temporally and spatially distinct . included in the analysis were unique shiga gene sequences that were available from genbank. we confirmed that stx <dig> shows more sequence variation than stx <dig> among our reference and clinical isolates. we also showed that our isolates' stx <dig> and stx <dig> genes each respectively showed little divergence and may display purifying selection.

RESULTS
similarity of shiga toxin  <dig> a and b subunit genes
the shiga toxin  <dig> a and b subunit genes showed very little difference in amino acid sequence . there were only four amino acid differences among the stx <dig> genes in the entire alignment. the change from threonine to serine at a <dig> in strains h <dig>  bcl <dig> and i <dig> would predictably have little effect on the enzymatic activity of the a subunit. the b <dig> change from threonine to serine in 88– <dig> and the b <dig> change from valine to alanine in h <dig> are also unlikely to change the binding function of the b subunit.

the phylogenetic trees made from the nucleotide sequences  and the amino acid sequences  were topologically the same with very short branch lengths. bootstrap replicates in both trees supported the h19/bcl17/i <dig> clade and the shigella dysenteriae/88– <dig> clade. the short branch lengths and relatively low bootstrap values can be directly attributed to the low number of informative characters in the analysis.

similarity of shiga toxin  <dig> a and b subunit genes
the shiga toxin  <dig> a and b subunit sequences showed much more sequence diversity than did the stx <dig> group. none of the putative substitutions replaced key residues used in the active site  <cit>  or either of the cysteines that form the disulfide bridge between a <dig> and a <dig>  there were  <dig> total amino acid differences from edl <dig> stx <dig> in this study's sequences,  <dig> in the a subunit and  <dig> in the b subunit. twenty-five of these changes occurred in i <dig> stx <dig>  the number of positions in each subunit that were affected was  <dig> for the a subunit and  <dig> for the b subunit. the stx <dig> alignment  shows all of the amino acid differences among this study's sequences, along with stx2d <dig>  stx2d <dig>  stx2e, stx2f, stx2g and citrobacter freundii stx <dig> sequences from genbank.

strains e <dig> and b2f <dig> have each been shown to contain two copies of the stx <dig> gene  <cit> . e <dig> carries one stx <dig> gene that is almost identical to the edl <dig> sequence and a second that differs by  <dig> nucleotides. three of these nucleotide differences result in three amino acid changes in the b subunit only. the stx <dig> amplified from e <dig> matches the genbank accession number m <dig> with no equivocal peaks in the chromatogram. b2f <dig> carries the stx2d <dig> and stx2d <dig> genes represented by the accessions af <dig> and af <dig>  respectively. these sequences differ from edl <dig> stx <dig> by  <dig> nucleotides with one amino acid change. the sequencing reaction chromatogram from our stx <dig> amplicon of the b2f <dig> strain showed nucleotide differences between both stx2d <dig> and stx2d <dig> with no ambiguities. these differences resulted in three amino acid changes along the sequence. in both e <dig> and b2f <dig>  the few sequence differences did not affect our analysis. however, until further analysis of our e <dig> and b2f <dig> strains is complete to determine whether they contain one or two stx <dig> genes, our sequences ef <dig> and ef <dig> should be held in question.

the ratio non-synonymous  to synonymous  substitutions was used to estimate whether positive or purifying selection had occurred at each amino acid site. a nonsynonymous:synonymous  ratio of greater than one indicates positive selection at that amino acid site whereas a dn:ds ratio of less than one shows purifying selection. forty percent of the amino acid sites in the full alignment showed purifying selection using the selecton program  <cit> . the stx <dig> a and b subunits showed  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of their amino acid sites were well conserved. 

the nucleotide phylogenetic tree  and the amino acid phylogenetic tree  showed almost the same topology with short branch lengths for our strains. the obvious dissimilarity of stx2e, stx2f and stx2g is striking in both the alignment and phylogenetic trees and is well supported by the high bootstrap values. idaho strain i <dig> had the most divergent sequence among the strains obtained from the idaho state health department and is most closely related to stx2d a subunit  <cit> . the lower bootstrap values in the figures are characteristic of highly similar sequences in the branches. interestingly, the c. freundii stx <dig> grouped with the stx2d group of elastase activated shiga toxins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this investigation into the phylogenetic relationships among shiga toxins confirmed that the two major groups, stx <dig> and stx <dig>  are easily differentiated by both their amino acid and nucleotide sequences. the phylogram in figure  <dig> shows stx <dig> and stx <dig> forming two distinct clades with stx2f branching off significantly from both. the stx <dig> group displayed an almost flat phylogeny whereas the stx <dig> group has much more sequence diversity. stx2d, stx2e and stx2g all show at least 91% similarity to the edl <dig> stx <dig> gene. the stx2f amino acid and nucleotide sequences are only  <dig>  and  <dig>  percent similar to edl <dig> stx <dig> sequences, respectively, making it the most divergent stx <dig> found to date. the greater diversity of stx <dig> sequences could be the result of sampling bias. since the majority of the gene sequences came from human outbreak pathogens and because stx <dig> is associated with more severe disease, this could have an effect on what strains are recovered. despite the fact that diarrheal illness is a leading causes of death worldwide  <cit> , most sources providing isolates used in this study are located in areas with well established public health systems. this source location could also introduce bias into the isolates investigated.

the significance of compiling these sequences became clear when both the stx <dig> tree and stx <dig> tree showed generally flat topologies. our further analysis of the nucleotide sequences for stx <dig> a and b subunits showed that a large proportion of the amino acid sites had undergone purifying selection. our hypothesis when undertaking this project was that shiga toxin sequences from different places and collected at different times would show divergence. our data analysis indicates that there is no significant divergence among either the stx <dig> or stx <dig> gene sequences based on collection time or location. the stx <dig> phylogeny  shows that these genes do not vary greatly and are perhaps undergoing purifying selective pressure. the stx <dig> phylogeny  is also generally flat among the strains we tested. this would indicate that among our strains, both the stx <dig> and stx <dig> gene sequences are closely conserved. one reason for the conservation of this sequence could be that intestinal shiga toxin producing e. coli in the bovine host are mitigating bovine leukemia virus induced disease  <cit> . another recent finding suggests that the shiga toxin might play a role in helping e. coli survive predation from bacteriovores outside of the cow  <cit> . since many of our strains can be related to illness produced from bovine feces, it is possible that a shiga toxin gene that is beneficial to the bacterium that carries it has undergone purifying selection to the benefit of both their bacterial and mammalian host.
