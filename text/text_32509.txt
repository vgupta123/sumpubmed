BACKGROUND
affymetrix genechips™  <cit>  are widely used in biomedical research for genome-wide expression profiling. the level of gene expression is typically summarized from a probe set composed of several  <dig> mer probes designed to span a target region based on a unigene cluster. summarized expression measurements for a probe set are typically derived using a variety of algorithms, including mas <dig>   <cit> , model-based-expression indices   <cit> , robust multi-chip-average   <cit> , and the position-dependent nearest neighbor  algorithm  <cit> .

significant effort has been placed on extracting accurate and robust expression measurements summarized from multiple probes using a variety of statistical algorithms  <cit> . recently, with the public release of microarray probe sequences, attention has been paid to the accuracy of individual probe annotations and its impact on gene expression data  <cit> . probes within a probe set can be both ambiguous  and heterogeneous . for example, examination of the probe sequences incorporated in the affymetrix human genome u95av <dig> array indicates that  <dig> % of the probes are nonspecific and  <dig> % are mistargeted  <cit> . moreover, interpretation of probe signal is complicated by probes cross-hybridizing to similar sequences and transcript variants from alternative splicing  <cit> . it should be noted that grouping probes that map to different targets may create divergent signals that will significantly influence expression measurements from stochastic-model-based summarization approaches . for example, stray signal arising from probes with multiple targets within a probe set have been shown to contribute to misleading biological relationships  <cit> . a more nuanced approach to estimating expression levels calls for consideration of alternative splicing, as more than half of all genes are alternatively spliced in the human genome  <cit> . while use of the unigene-based definition of affymetrix probe sets may be sufficient to provide overall differential gene expression estimates, it is inadequate for distinguishing or preserving signal data arising from different transcript variants  <cit> .

several groups have explored the effects of using alternative microarray annotations. by matching probe sequences to an up-to-date reference sequence  database  <cit> , gautier et al  <cit>  investigated an "alternative mapping" approach, wherein probes were grouped together if they matched a common refseq transcript and were excluded from a probe set if they matched  <dig> or more refseq entries. while this approach increases the specificity of each probe set, it might prove impractical in the long term with the continued growth of the refseq database, resulting in the erosion of probe sets over time. carter et al  <cit>  adopted a redefinition of affymetrix probe sets where probes were matched against cdna clones on spotted arrays. their method showed improved concordance of expression measurements, hinting that concordant annotation would support concordance of results. in contrast, when they used the aceview transcript database to match affymetrix probe sets containing probes that could be sequence matched to the same transcript sequence as the cdna clone , they found relatively low cross-platform consistency as compared to direct sequence overlap. they postulated that the low correlation might be due to a number of factors including the presence of splice variants, the probes being subject to different cross-hybridization patterns, or incorrect clone sequence predictions  <cit> . more recently, dai et al  <cit>  provided a method for redefining affymetrix probe sets using several gene and transcript databases. in their regrouping strategy, all probes that match a single transcript or gene are simply grouped into a probe set. these approaches however, did not account for the heterogeneous manner in which individual probes can target transcripts. hence, the expression signal from a given probe set is summarized across probes that individually map to varied and/or multiple sets of transcript variants.

we propose here a new method for constructing probe sets for affymetrix genechips based on the aceview database, a comprehensive listing of human transcripts  <cit> . the key feature of our probe set definition method is that all probes within a probe set match a common set of aceview transcripts. by doing so, transcript-level annotations are more accurate because probes regrouped within a given probe set homogeneously map to a single transcript variant or a set of alternatively spliced transcripts . however, remapping probes in this way can reduce the size of a probe set, raising concerns of reliability  <cit> . through a systematic evaluation of standard datasets, we establish the minimum probe set size required for deriving a robust expression measurement. finally, we demonstrate the usage of our approach by reanalyzing actual gene expression data from a biological experiment and measuring the concordance between aceview transcript-matched data from two different platforms.

RESULTS
redefinition of affymetrix probe sets
we regrouped probes into a probe set such that all probes within a probe set match a common set of transcripts, based on our current knowledge of the transcriptome found in aceview. the first step was to map individual probes to transcripts in the aceview database . our analysis found that the percentage of probe sequences matching to transcripts in the aceview database is very high; approximately 90% of the probes on the genechips u95a, u133a, and about 80% on the human genome u133a plus  <dig>  array, were mapped to one or more aceview transcripts . in contrast, only about 52% of the probes on u <dig> plus  <dig>  can be mapped to the refseq collection.

probes matching non-human sequences or duplicated probe sequences were excluded from the calculation.

given a specific probe-to-transcript mapping, defining a probe set is straightforward: probes that are mapped to the same set of transcripts naturally belong to a common probe set. there are two ways in which a new probe set can be formed: it can be derived solely from a single affymetrix probe set or it can be formed by merging probes from  <dig> or more affymetrix probe sets. one example of the first scenario is shown in figure  <dig> . the affymetrix probe set 34666_at on the genechip u95av <dig> contains  <dig> probes and targets the refseq entry nm_ <dig> which encodes superoxide dismutase, mitochondrial . a "higher resolution" detailed view based on our probe-to-transcript mapping shows that this probe set actually maps to  <dig> aceview transcripts. using our new probe set definition, the first five probes form one probe set since they all match transcripts sod <dig> baug <dig>  sod <dig> caug <dig> and sod <dig> iaug05; the next  <dig> probes match the transcript set sod <dig> baug <dig> and sod <dig> caug <dig>  so they form another probe set, and the last  <dig> only match transcript sod <dig> baug <dig> to form yet another group. note that, in our new probe set definition, probe sets never share probes, but the transcripts they represent may overlap.

some statistics of the newly defined probe sets for affymetrix genechips u95a, u133a and u <dig> plus  <dig>  are shown in table  <dig>  in the majority of cases, our redefinition splits an affymetrix probe set into smaller probe sets; for example, only about 17%, 15% and 22% of newly defined probe sets maintain the original affymetrix definition for the genechip u95a, u133a and u <dig> plus  <dig>  respectively. unlike the nominally uniform size of all original affymetrix probe sets, such regrouping of probes results in probe sets of varying sizes. for instance, the new probe set size for the u95a chip ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  and for the u133a chip, it ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> . the distribution of probe set sizes for u95a and u133a chips are shown in figure  <dig> 

because of the large transcript-to-gene ratio in aceview, a majority of the probe sets match more than one aceview transcript. interestingly there is an inverse relationship between probe set size and the number of transcripts a probe set targets. the inverse relationship is especially strong in probe sets derived by splitting, i.e. those probe sets smaller than the standard affymetrix probe sets , but it is also apparent in merged probe sets, i.e. those larger than the standard affymetrix probe sets.

evaluation of the effect of probe set size on the detection of differential expression
we observed that increasing probe set homogeneity resulted in smaller probe sets. for example, the redefinition of probe sets on genechip u95a results in 20% of the probe sets containing only  <dig> probe and 40% having fewer than  <dig> probes . to address how the probe set size influences the identification of differential expression, we created  <dig> artificial data sets from the u133a latin square data. each data set contains expression measurements that are summarized from randomly selected subsets  of probes from each affymetrix probe set. we chose the u133a latin square data because all probes of the spike-ins are known to accurately match their intended targets. by eliminating the influence of sequence specificity on gene expression measurements, the results can be evaluated solely on the basis of probe set size. all comparisons were conducted using the evaluative tools in affycomp  <cit> , and the rma summarization algorithm was used to derive summarized gene expression values.

to compare the overall variation in the data, we plotted the inter-quartile range  of the log fold-changes for non-spiked-in probe sets , and the average number of false positives  against the number of probes used for deriving the expression measurements for the probe sets. in both cases, an increased probe set size improves the reliability of expression measurements as shown by the lower variability and a significant reduction in the number of false positives . notably, there is a significant drop of both iqr and afp when the probe set size is greater than  <dig>  next, to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity in detecting differential expression, receiver operating characteristic  curves were plotted and compared . the average roc curves for expression measurements derived from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> probes  were drawn using all data where the fold-change ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  and a subset of data where fold-change equals  <dig> . consistent with our earlier observations of reduced variance, at a given false positive rate, we observed increased power with increased probe set size. importantly, the sensitivity-specificity ratio improved dramatically when the probe set size was  <dig> or more.

application of new probe set definition to biological datasets
by regrouping probes into homogeneous probe sets using the aceview mapping, gene expression is examined at the transcript level rather than the gene level. higher resolution probe set definitions allowed us to identify specific transcript variants that were initially undetectable within the original heterogeneous probe sets. in an earlier experiment using the affymetrix platform, we compared pancreatic tumor cells prior to and after serum removal to study early events accompanying islet cell differentiation  <cit> . here, this data set was reanalyzed with both the original and the new probe set definitions and the two lists of differentially expressed genes were compared. in this analysis, we consider a gene or a probe set differentially expressed if the false discovery rate  adjusted p-value is less than  <dig>  and the fold-change  is greater than  <dig> .

first, we observe that a vast majority of genes were identified by both probe set definitions. of the  <dig> affymetrix probe sets shown to be differentially expressed,  <dig>  represent the same genes as those identified using the new probe set definition. although the gene lists derived from both probe set definitions largely overlap, the new probe set provides additional detailed information on which set of transcripts are likely differentially expressed. one example is shown in figure  <dig>  the affymetrix probe set "33631_at" is significantly differentially expressed , and it targets the gene txnl4a which has at least  <dig> transcript variants . our new definition divides this probe set into two new probe sets, one of which  specifically targets transcripts d and e and seems to be highly significant . the other probe set  targets potentially many different transcript variants at the 3' end of the gene and does not show significant difference in expression levels between control and treatment samples . in this example, applying the new probe set definition clearly helps to identify the specific transcript variants that are likely differentially expressed. it should be noted that such transcript-level information is critical for designing probes and primers for real-time pcr  validation. for example, selecting the primers/probes targeting the 3' end of txnl4a as shown in figure  <dig> would mask the detection of expression level differences between the treatment and control group. table  <dig> lists genes which were identified as differentially expressed by both the affymetrix and the new probe set definitions, but the new sets increased the resolution of the assay, narrowing the detection of differential expression changes to a specific set of transcripts,

the probe set identifiers ending with "_at" are from affymetrix; and those beginning with "b0805_" are newly defined here. fold changes are ratios of the mean values of the treatment versus values of the control group, and the negative values indicate changes in the opposite direction.

comparing the two gene lists also identifies about 13–16% of genes/probe sets which can only be identified as being differentially expressed with either the original or the new probe set definition. the majority of the genes missed by either definition have p-values and fold-changes close to the threshold chosen above , suggesting that the results using the two probe set definitions are largely similar. however, in a few cases, we observed that with higher resolution of the new probe set definition, new transcript level changes are also uncovered. one example is shown in figure  <dig>  where the probe-level signals were plotted . the original affymetrix probe set "34666_at" is not considered to be differentially expressed at the 5% significance level . however, in our new aceview-based definition,  <dig> probes in this probe set  were divided into  <dig> new probe sets. one probe set  which maps to transcript variants b, c, and i of sod <dig>  appears to be significantly downregulated ; the other two new probe sets map to variants b and c  or to b  only, and both probe sets are not significantly changed . from these results, we can infer that variant i might be significantly differentially expressed since it is being uniquely interrogated by b0805_ <dig>  another example is the affymetrix probe set "37513_at" representing stearoyl-coa desaturase . this gene was found to be differentially expressed only by using the new definition , and this change was validated by real-time pcr .

comparing cross-platform data using the new probe set definition
to further evaluate our probe set redefinition, we conducted a full-scale transcript-level cross-platform comparison. most previous cross-platform analyses have utilized gene-level annotations. we hypothesized that transcript-level annotation of probe sets can be used to better match probe identifiers across different microarray platforms, thereby improving the consistency of cross-platform measurements. hence, two identifiers  are matched if both map to a common set of aceview transcripts, whereas the original affymetrix probe sets were matched to codelink probes using common unigene identifiers . table  <dig> shows the cross-platform concordance measured by the pearson's correlation of log-ratios. the overall correlation coefficients calculated using the unigene-based matches are about the same as those using the transcript-based matches. however, after excluding the less reliable probe sets , the correlation derived from transcript-based matches is higher across three replicates . the consistent, though small, improvement in correlations suggests that there may be better cross-platform comparability when the transcriptome is probed with higherresolution. similar improvements are observed when using refseq-based mapping by dai et al  <cit> . furthermore, we observed poor correlation between the affymetrix and codelink data for newly defined affymetrix probe sets with only  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> probes, providing additional evidence that measurements of newly defined probe sets with small probe set sizes  are less reliable than those with larger probe set sizes.

the d1-d <dig> and c1-c <dig> are replicates in the treatment group and the control group respectively. the correlation is calculated on log-ratios, where the pairing of technical replicates is arbitrary. the best concordance between two platforms was observed using aceview-based transcript-level probe sets  and refseq based probe sets.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this report we present a new approach to integrating an up-to-date probe annotation into routine affymetrix array analysis. although the affymetrix genechip arrays are not particularly designed to detect alternative transcripts, with careful transcript-level annotation we have demonstrated that specificity can be achieved by using the new probe set definition. one of the advantages of using the newly redefined probe sets is that it allows the examination of gene expression in-depth at the transcript level, providing a level of clarity in data interpretation unavailable at the gene level or even at the refseq transcript level. with the total number of aceview transcripts at  <dig>  compared with  <dig>  in refseq, probes from all chips examined matched approximately four times the number of transcripts in aceview relative to ones annotated in refseq. in addition, ~80% of all u <dig> plus  <dig>  array probes matched aceview transcripts, which was ~50% more than the number that matched to refseq. such a detailed view is necessary if one needs to design primers or probes for quantitative-pcr verification. moreover, our method naturally separates the ambiguous and cross-hybridizing probes and automatically groups gene specific probes.

although our approach to grouping probes into probe sets is independent of the particular transcript database being used, we consider aceview to be the most comprehensive and accurate database publicly available for conducting such transcript-level reannotation of probes. in comparison to refseq, which is a highly curated yet incomplete mapping of the transcriptome, aceview annotations identify on average,  <dig>  transcripts per gene, greatly exceeding that of refseq's  <dig>  per gene. furthermore, in annotating the encode region <cit> , the quality of aceview transcript annotation has been shown to be comparable with the gold-standard manual havana annotation. if the overall depth and quality was considered, among the  <dig> annotation approaches compared, aceview is "by far the closest match" to the painstaking manual transcript annotation  <cit> .

as a result of maintaining homogenous probe sets and excluding ambiguous and cross-hybridizing probes, this new redefinition often results in small probe sets . using a random sampling of probes from the original affymetrix probe sets, we demonstrate that, without considering the annotation issue, at least  <dig> probes may be required for deriving reliable expression measurements. from all the arrays studied, these adequately sized probe sets comprise 58% of all new probe sets. our observation that probe sets with fewer than  <dig> probes yield poor data may arise from a number of factors. non-functioning probes may exist for certain probe sets: for instance, on the u95a chip, a number of probe pairs for probe sets 407_at and 36889_at were found to perform poorly  <cit> . deviation of probe length on the array from the designed 25-mer, due to synthesis inefficiency, may also contribute to both variability and poor probe performance, including array-to-array variation  <cit> . non-functioning probes due to the latter case are particularly difficult to trace and this problem is probably only circumvented by integrating data from multiple probes.

a recent paper by dai et al  <cit>  provided a method for redefining affymetrix probe sets using several gene and transcript databases. their regrouping strategy, however, is fundamentally different from the current method in that with their method, all probes that match a single transcript or gene are simply grouped into a probe set. however, their method does not generate "transcript-specific" probe sets for genes with multiple transcripts, and does not eliminate probe sets with multiple targets  <cit> . hence, there may be some probes within a newly regrouped probe set that may actually cross-hybridize to a different transcript. an example of this can be considered using figure  <dig> to demonstrate. according to their method, transcript b  would utilize all probes from the original affymetrix probe set. with our redefinition, only the last  <dig> probes  are specific for this transcript. furthermore, with their method, transcript c of sod <dig> will be represented by merging our newly redefined probe sets, b0805_ <dig> and b0805_ <dig>  it is clear that the probes from these different probe sets show gene expression profiles that are markedly different. thus, we expect that the specificity and homogeneity within our probe sets will result in more accurate gene expression measurements, as recently suggested in  <cit> . to demonstrate, using the refseq-based remapping of dai et al, there were clear differences in relative gene expression changes obtained, examples of which are presented in supplemental figures  <dig>  and  <dig>  . however, while these examples demonstrate differences in individual results, they did not translate into global improvements in the cross-platform correlation using our current method over refseq-mapped probe sets. a possible probe selection bias towards abundant transcripts through the use of refseq-based probe sets may account for this lack of difference.

the quality of the new probe set definition depends on a number of factors. it is notable that 2–4% of probes on the human arrays studied are ambiguous , and the resulting probe sets should be used with caution. the gene targeted by each new probe set are made available in the annotation files downloadable from  <cit> . in addition, because of the relative lack of information on poly-a sites, it should be stressed that the current probe sets may not accurately reflect the regulation that occurs at the level of alternative poly-adenylation. for instance, regrouping of probes derived from more than one affymetrix probe set may have resulted from poly-a sites currently unannotated in aceview. conversely, there may have been some probe sets which are split by the presence of partial cdnas in aceview that do not clearly define a poly-a site. as greater sequence coverage and refinement of the human genome become available, a strategy such as described here would permit continuous updating and refinement of probe sets, and better interpretation of results, based on the latest knowledge  <cit> . while we used aceview for redefining probe sets, the method of regrouping probes can be applied using any public or "in-house" database, and the guidelines provided here for creating a viable "probe set" should be generally applicable. this method is also particularly relevant with the recently developed exon arrays which have genome-wide probe content specific to individual exons, observed or predicted. a method to estimate quantitative expression data at the gene-level is suggested in  <cit> . this approach employs a variety of annotations for grouping probes into sets, followed by summarization with the plier algorithm  <cit>  or a derivative of it. however, we note that while transcript level annotations can be derived from naturally homogeneous exon-level probe sets, preliminary examination indicates that not all probe sets are actually homogeneous. exon array probes are based on probe selection regions, or psr, which are built around "exon clusters" or overlapping exons that may or may not share similar splice sites  <cit> . hence exon arrays, while providing a significant improvement over 3' expression arrays towards transcript specificity, may continue to heterogeneously target multiple transcript variants. since an array design of  <dig> probes per single exon minimally satisfies the requirements for a summarized expression value, splitting these into smaller sets might further degrade the accuracy of these probe sets. with the rising number of alternative variants annotated in aceview and elsewhere, transcript-specific arrays would require much higher densities to achieve even greater resolution while maintaining an adequate number of probes from which to extract accurate expression data. as such, probes on whole genome tiling arrays designed for transcript mapping could be grouped de novo based on aceview transcripts and are a viable platform for this strategy.

in conclusion, our transcript-level reannotation and redefinition of probe sets complement the original affymetrix design. redefinitions introduce probe sets whose sizes may not support reliable statistical summarization; therefore, we advocate using our transcript-level mapping redefinition in a secondary analysis step rather than as a replacement. knowing which specific transcripts are differentially expressed is important to properly design probe/primer pairs for validation purposes. the custom chip-description-files  and annotation files for our new probe set definitions  <cit>  are compatible with bioconductor, with affymetrix's expression console or third party software.
