BACKGROUND
molecular mechanisms underlying initiation of new roots have been extensively studied in the plant model arabidopsis thaliana  . in the embryonic primary root of arabidopsis, new root meristems derive from pericycle founder cells. these meristems give rise to post-embryonic roots named lateral roots . several genes related to auxin, involved in the mitotic competence of pericycle cells, in lr primordia initiation, patterning and lr emergence have been identified  <cit> . in cereals, the major part of the root system is made of post-embryonic stem-derived roots named crown roots . rice  is a relevant model to study the genetic control of cr development  <cit> . to date only a few rice mutants with less or no crown root have been identified. one of those is altered in crl <dig> /osgnom <dig> that encodes an arf-gef   <cit>  and is homologous to arabidopsis atgnom <dig>  <cit> . atgnom <dig> regulates the intracellular traffic of pin <dig>  auxin efflux carrier proteins  <cit> , and by consequence modulates polar auxin transport involved in cell division events leading to the differentiation of lr meristem  <cit> . the study of the crl4/osgnom <dig> mutant in rice suggested that ospin may regulate polarised auxin transport that controls the first divisions of the ground meristem, the tissue giving birth to cr  <cit> . two other mutants named adventitious rootless <dig>  and crown rootless <dig>  are devoid of crown root  <cit> . they are both affected in the arl1/crl <dig> gene  that encodes an as2/lob -domain transcription factor  <cit> . crl <dig> is expressed in parenchyma cells adjacent to the peripheral vascular cylinder of the stem that is the area of cr initiation  <cit> . crl <dig> expression is induced by auxin likely via direct binding of an arf  transcription factor  to its promoter  <cit> . crl <dig> is homologous to arabidopsis lbd <dig>  and lbd <dig> that are directly induced by auxin via arf <dig> and arf <dig> and necessary for lateral root initiation  <cit> .

the absence of cr primordia in crl <dig> mutant suggests that the crl <dig> transcription factor acts upstream of the gene regulatory network that control the early steps of cr primordia differentiation. in order to identify genes involved in this process, we compared global gene expression profiles in stem bases of crl <dig> and wild-type  plants, using rice expression arrays . we identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed in the crl <dig> mutant. to arrange molecular events downstream of auxin and crl <dig>  we analysed expression kinetics of a selected subset of  <dig> genes in response to auxin treatment in crl <dig> and wt. this allowed to identify  <dig> crl1-dependent auxin responsive genes. two of them or their orthologues in a. thaliana, fsm /fas <dig>  and gte <dig>  were already reported to be involved in chromatin remodelling and to affect shoot and root development, meristem differentiation and functioning. the third one encodes a map  that may be involved in the control of cell division. our results support the conclusion that these genes, and the related biological processes, are likely involved in crown root differentiation and are under the control of crl <dig> 

methods
plant material and growth conditions
hulled seeds of wild-type and crl <dig> mutant rice  were disinfected and inoculated under sterile conditions in square petri dishes  containing half strength murashige and skoog  medium  and  <dig> % agar type ii  and were incubated in a vertical position at 26°c and under a  <dig> h light/ <dig> h dark photoperiod. stem bases used for transcriptome analysis were collected from  <dig> day-old plantlets. for auxin treatment, seven day-old axenic seedlings were transferred in flasks containing half strength ms liquid medium, the culture medium was supplemented with 10-6m indole acetic acid   one day after transfer. the crl <dig> mutant is a kind gift of pr. makoto matsuoka   <cit> .

rna extraction and preparation
for each biological replicate, twenty stem bases  were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. rna were extracted with plant rneasy  and treated on column with dnase . they were quantified with a nanoquant at  <dig> nm wavelength and analysed for quality on a bioanalyzer  <dig> .  <dig> ng of total rna were used for a single amplification. antisense rna strand were then biotynilated according the affymetrix  ivt express protocol.

array hybridisation and analysis
all steps were performed according manufacturer's instructions  unless otherwise stated. equipments were provided by affymetrix company. twelve μg of biotin-labelled antisens rnas were fragmented and hybridized to genechip rice genome arrays  for  <dig> h at 45°c and  <dig> rpm in a hybridisation oven  <dig>  arrays were washed, labelled with phycoerythrin on the fluidic station  <dig> and read with the scanner  <dig> 7g. data acquisition was done with the genechip command console. array pictures were analysed with mas <dig> algorithm of the expression console software . default parameters were applied, global scaling method was used to normalise data . a comparative analysis was carried out for each biological replicate with mas <dig> algorithm in the genechip operating software . probes with a "present" detection call were kept for subsequent analysis, "absent" or "marginal" were rejected. the three biological replicates were compared. expression of a gene was considered as differentially increased or decreased when its signal ratio was consistently superior to  <dig> or lower than  <dig>  respectively with a p-value p ≤  <dig>  in the three replicates. orygenes database http://orygenesdb.cirad.fr/ 
 <cit>  was used to retrieve gene annotation in rice and in arabidopsis corresponding to selected affymetrix probes. microarray data obtained in this study are available in the gene expression omnibus  database under the reference gse <dig> 

rt-qpcr 
cdna synthesis was performed using rq dnase i-treated total rna preparations  and superscript iii reverse transcriptase kit . relative transcript abundance of selected genes  was determined using the roche lightcycler  <dig> system and the lc <dig> sybr green i master kit . the range of primer efficiencies observed for the couples of primers used was comprised between  <dig>  and  <dig>  measurements were taken for three or four biologically independent sets of samples. a technical replicate was performed for each replicate. expression level of exp  reference gene was used to normalize gene expression level between the different timepoints  <cit> . we verified that both in crl <dig> mutant and wt, the ct value of the exp gene remained stable at different times after auxin treatment and was comprised for different independent biological and technical repetition of the experiment between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in addition, lightcycler melting curves were obtained for the reactions, revealing single peak melting curves for all amplification products. the amplification data were analysed using the second derivative maximum method, and resulting cp values were converted into relative expression values using the comparative ct method  <cit> . mean values of expression levels obtained from different biological repetitions were statistically compared using a student's t-test.

RESULTS
transcript profiling of crownrootless <dig> stem base
total rnas were extracted from wt and crl <dig> stem bases of  <dig> day-old seedlings. the sampled zone was located just above the zone of emergence of cr in the wt, which correspond to the zone where cr primordia differentiate . rnas were amplified, labelled and hybridised on genechip rice genome arrays . transcript profiling of three independent biological replicates obtained from wt and crl <dig> were compared. only genes exhibiting a significant induction or repression in the three replicates were selected for further analysis. we identified  <dig> and  <dig> genes down- and up-regulated respectively at least twofold in the crl <dig> mutant . in both groups, about  <dig> genes were differentially regulated less than 5-fold on average. about 10% of the genes were differentially regulated more than 5-fold in crownrootless <dig> relative to wild-type . genes were annotated automatically with function prediction in rice and arabidopsis and categorised manually according to their putative molecular function . about one third of differentially regulated genes had no predicted function and about one quarter was involved in metabolism. most of the up-regulated genes in crl <dig>  fell into transduction, transcription factor and cell cycle/dna categories whereas down-regulated genes in crl <dig>  were rather distributed in transduction, post-translation/proteolysis and transport categories .

for all genes, and the most similar genes in arabidopsis, we searched for published data relative to their characterised functions. the rice genome sequence has been available since  <dig>  <cit> . despite an important effort of the scientific community to assign to each gene a function, very few genes have been functionally characterised yet. precise information was found for only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes identified, mostly in reference to a known function of the arabidopsis ortholog . interestingly, most of these genes had an assigned function related to signal transduction in particular auxin or to gene expression regulation  associated with root development or meristem differentiation and functioning.

auxin-induced crl <dig> expression was used to determine crl1-dependent auxin-response genes
in order to determine how the genes identified by transcript profiling operate in the gene regulatory network downstream of crl <dig>  we took advantage of the known transcriptional regulation of crl <dig> by auxin. auxin  activates crl <dig> expression within one hour following exogenous treatment . as crl <dig> is a transcriptional activator , we anticipated that expression of crl <dig> target genes would increase between  <dig> and  <dig> hours following auxin treatment in wt plants, but not in crl <dig> plants. we selected a subset of  <dig> genes, including most of the  <dig> genes previously mentioned. these genes were chosen according to a differential regulation in crl <dig> mutant relative to wild-type, their molecular function or their putative role in a developmental process based on available literature data. expression kinetics of the selected genes in response to iaa treatment  in wt and crl <dig> stem base was measured by rt-qpcr.

as expected, crl <dig> expression was highly induced  <dig> hour following auxin treatment and was consistently observed among all the biological replicates with a magnitude ranging between  <dig> and 12-fold. crl <dig> expression level decreased following one hour, as a probable result of a negative feedback loop. expression of osiaa <dig> , an early auxin-responsive gene, was induced in the same time frame than crl <dig> thereby confirming the efficiency of the auxin treatment  <cit> .

auxin homeostasis may be altered in crl <dig> stem base
aux/iaa genes encode regulatory proteins involved in auxin signal transduction that interact with arf tf and repress their activity in absence of auxin  <cit> . tir1-dependent auxin perception leads to the degradation of aux/iaa via the ubiquitin pathway and to the regulation of expression of auxin-responsive genes by arf. this mechanism participates in the regulation of lr differentiation in arabidopsis involving iaa14-mediated arf <dig> and arf <dig> repression  <cit> . in rice, osarf <dig> is able to bind in vitro an auxin response element in the crl <dig> promoter. moreover the expression in rice of a mutated form of osiaa <dig> altered in its ubiquitination site causes the inhibition of the induction of crl <dig> expression by auxin  <cit>  which results in a reduced number of cr  <cit> . here we found that osiaa <dig> was doic and that osiaa <dig> and osiaa <dig> were upic. osiaa <dig> belongs to the same expression cluster than osiaa <dig> and is specifically expressed in differentiated roots and stems  <cit> . osiaa <dig> is mostly expressed in plumule and floral organs whereas osiaa <dig> is expressed in various organs including radicle or root  <cit> . further rt-qpcr analysis showed that osiaa <dig> and osiaa <dig> were early auxin responsive genes both in wt and crl <dig> stem bases . this indicates that their regulation by auxin does not require crl <dig>  it is likely that the absence of root meristem in the stem base of crl <dig> mutant modifies the auxin balance and results in differential regulation of auxin regulated genes independently of crl <dig>  this also holds true for the doic os09g <dig> gene which encodes osbtbn <dig>  a protein presenting homology with nph <dig> family proteins. in arabidopsis the npy <dig>  gene belongs to the nph <dig> gene family and regulates auxin-mediated plant development  <cit> . npy genes are highly expressed in root tips and contribute to root gravitropism response  <cit> . further expression analysis showed that os09g <dig> is an early auxin responsive gene but this response to auxin did not require crl <dig> . in this study we also characterized two late auxin-responsive genes regulated independently of crl1: osmip <dig>  and osprr <dig> . the doic osmip <dig>  gene is very similar to antirrhinum ternary complex factor mip <dig> gene. mip <dig> interacts with mads-box tf involved in meristem determination during floral transition  <cit> . the doic osprr <dig>  gene is orthologous to the arabidopsis aprr <dig> gene belonging to the aprr1/toc <dig>  quintet that participates in the circadian regulation of numerous genes notably involved in flowering time and light response  <cit> . the latter results suggest that auxin-regulated genes involved in the control of meristem functioning are differentially regulated in the crl <dig> mutant, but are not under the direct control of crl <dig> 

expression of nutrient and water status related genes varies in crl <dig> stem base
the absence of cr in the crl <dig> mutant may also modify the nutrient and water status of the plant. we further analysed the differential expression pattern of genes related to these statuses. genes involved in mineral homeostasis and in the response to water deficit indeed appear to be differentially regulated in crl <dig> . the doic os06g <dig> gene encodes a protein orthologous to atspx <dig> . in arabidopsis, atspx <dig> with atspx <dig>  atspx <dig> and atspx <dig> are involved in phosphate  homeostasis  <cit> . in rice osspx <dig> is a negative regulator of p uptake but the function of the other ones is still unknown  <cit> . other genes putatively involved in ion transport such as os02g <dig> that encodes the kob <dig>  have been found to be differentially regulated between wt and crl <dig>  <cit> .

several upic genes with a function related to osmotic stress or abscissic acid were identified. os07g <dig> encodes the oserd <dig>  protein orthologous to zmerd <dig> that enhances drought and salt tolerance when constitutively expressed in arabidopsis  <cit> . os05g <dig> encodes a bzip transcription factor homologous to atareb <dig>  that is involved in abscissic acid signal transduction  <cit> . the doic os05g <dig> gene encodes a protein orthologous to the conserved eukaryotic tor  kinase that promote cell growth in response to favourable conditions. in arabidopsis attor is involved in the inhibition of root growth in response to osmotic stress and excess of nitrate  <cit> . the absence of cr of the crl <dig> mutant may influence the nutrient and water status of the plant, and consequently modulate the expression of nutrient and stress related genes.

genes related to meristem differentiation are deregulated in crl <dig> and some of them are crl1-dependent auxin responsive genes
several genes already identified to regulate processes involved in cell or meristem differentiation are differentially regulated in crl <dig>  the doic os08g <dig> gene encodes a map and is a crl1-dependent auxin responsive gene . this suggests that it can be a component of the gene regulatory network directly controlled by crl <dig>  its function has not been determined yet either in rice or in arabidopsis. nevertheless the function of other map has been characterized in arabidopsis. for example, atmap70- <dig> is involved in the maintenance of cellular polarity and ensures regular extension of plant organs  <cit> . the map spiral <dig> mutant is defective in directional cell elongation and exhibits right-handed helical growth in longitudinally expanding organs such as the roots  <cit> . this suggests that the map encoded by os08g <dig> may be involved in polarized cellular growth during early steps of cr meristem organization regulated by crl <dig> 

different genes have a function related with root hair or root meristem differentiation. the upic os03g <dig> gene encodes an exocyst complex component sec <dig> family protein orthologous to maize roothairless <dig> protein  <cit> .

several upic genes encode wd domain g-beta repeat domain containing proteins that can interact with tf or chromatin associated proteins to regulate gene expression and cell or meristem differentiation processes. one of them, osttg <dig>  , is orthologous to atttg <dig> that is involved in different epidermis cell differentiation pathways, including root hair differentiation in arabidopsis  <cit> . os07g <dig> is homologous to atrid <dig> , involved in cell proliferation and in the control of adventitious root initiation in arabidopsis  <cit> .

other genes have a function related to meristem differentiation and functioning. os03g <dig> is orthologous to atmsi <dig> . msi1-like wd- <dig> repeat proteins are components of different complexes controlling chromatin dynamics. in plants, msi1-like proteins are involved in regulatory pathways controlling reproductive meristem transition, embryo and gametophyte development  <cit> . the upic os08g <dig> gene encodes a putative c2h <dig> zinc finger protein and is homologous to se  in arabidopsis which is involved in mirna gene silencing pathway that participates to coordinate meristem activity and axial patterning  <cit> . the doic os12g <dig> gene encodes a nucleolar complex protein  <dig> orthologous to atrbl  is involved in floral developmental homeostasis  <cit> . in addition the upic os12g <dig> gene, orthologous to atsdg <dig> , regulates the epigenetic transcriptional activation and contributes to the regulation of flc , a gene involved in flowering induction in the shoot apical meristem  <cit> . these genes are probably not directly regulated by crl <dig>  but their differential expression in crl <dig> suggests that the lack of cr meristem differentiation may also induce fedback regulatory pathway acting on general tf and chromatin regulatory factors known to be involved in cell and meristem differentiation.

the involvement of chromatin remodelling factor in cr initiation is supported by the fact that two genes related to this process were found to be doic and crl1-dependent auxin responsive genes . the gene osfsm   encodes a component of the caf <dig>  complex and is orthologous to fas <dig>  in arabidopsis  <cit> . fas <dig> is involved in the regulation of both shoot and root development regulation. fas <dig> is strongly expressed in root tips and contributes to the maintenance of scarecrow expression pattern which is essential to root meristem maintenance and root radial differentiation  <cit> . the rice fsm mutant exhibits an altered development including a reduced number of cr, a reduced seminal root growth and strong defects in root meristem structure. osfsm is also expressed in root tips  <cit> . the other doic and crl1-dependent auxin responsive gene  encodes a bromodomain-containing protein homologous to the arabidopsis gte <dig>  gte <dig> is involved in the maintenance of the mitotic cell cycle and may be related to chromatin remodelling. in gte <dig> mutants, root development is delayed and the number of lateral root is reduced. in addition, in this mutant, a partial loss of identity is observed for quiescent centre cells and the division pattern of initial cells is disrupted  <cit> . fsm and gte <dig> play important roles in the control of root meristem differentiation and maintenance. the differential expression of fsm and osgte <dig> in response to auxin in crl <dig> mutant versus wt suggests that these genes are early crl <dig> target genes and stress that chromatin structure modulation and cell cycle regulation may be essential parameters in early steps of cr meristem differentiation in rice.

CONCLUSIONS
first hypotheses toward the arrangement of the crown root differentiation gene regulatory network controlled by crl1
the differential transcriptome analysis of crl <dig> versus wt allowed the identification of a set of genes differentially regulated in crl <dig> stem base. further rt-qpcr analysis of the response to auxin of a subset of genes in wt and crl <dig> was used to determine their dependence to crl <dig>  some genes such as osiaa and nph3-like, which are involved in auxin response and auxin-mediated plant development are crl1-independent auxin responsive genes. it is likely that the differential regulation of these genes in crl <dig> versus wt results from the absence of cr meristems that may modify the auxin balance in the crl <dig> mutant stem base tissues. the absence of cr in crl <dig> may also modify the nutrient and water status of the plant and result in the differential expression of genes involved in nutrient uptake or water stress response. similarly the absence of cr differentiation in crl <dig> may deregulate the expression of genes involved in the control of meristem differentiation and cell division.

three genes were found to be crl1-dependent auxin responsive genes. they are likely directly regulated by crl <dig>  this concern os08g <dig> which encodes a microtubule-associated protein  that could be involved in asymmetric control of cell division during early steps of cr meristem differentiation, and the two genes fsm and gte <dig> that encode chromatin remodelling and cell cycle regulation factors known to be involved in rice or arabidopsis on the proper cell division patterning and maintenance of the root meristem.
