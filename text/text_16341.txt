BACKGROUND
l-carnitine  is a low molecular ammonium compound, which is synthesized from the two essential amino acids lysine and methionine mostly in liver and kidney . it is an important cofactor for the transport of long chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membranes into the matrix where they can be broken down by ß-oxidation to acetyl-coa to obtain energy via the citric cycle  <cit> . due to its regulative functions on the acetyl-coa pools and its transporting features of acyl groups, l-carnitine covers also a key role in glucose metabolism and assists in fuel sensing  <cit> . an abnormal increase of intramitochondrial acetyl-coa concentration in liver cells leads to increased gluconeogenesis, one aspect of diabetes  <cit> . high levels of acetyl-coa have also been associated with abnormalities in skeletal muscles of diabetic patients, where insulin seems to be unable to mediate the switch from lipid to glucose metabolism leading to decreased glucose utilization  <cit> .

carnitine acetyltransferase  is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme, which transfers short acyl groups from acyl-coa to l-carnitine resulting in an acetyl-carnitine-ester  <cit> . therefore it defines the equilibrium of acetyl-coa  and acetylcarnitine   <cit> . highest expression levels of crat are reached in muscle cells and testis  <cit> . although expression levels are low in liver it exerts a significant metabolic function by regulating acetyl-coa pools at the crossroads of anabolic and catabolic pathways  <cit> . carnitine supplementation promotes crat-mediated acetylcarnitine efflux and improves metabolic outcome in obese rodents  <cit> . furthermore the importance of crat has been recently underlined by the fact that muscle-specific knock-out mice showed increased metabolic inflexibility, meaning that they failed to adjust appropriately to mitochondrial fuel selection in response to nutritional cues  <cit> . another very supportive fact for our study was that niddm patients showed decreased levels of crat mrna levels  <cit> . these findings render crat to be an interesting pharmacological target for treatment of niddm. l-carnitine itself could be a pharmacological tool since supplementation after artificially induced l-carnitine deficiency induces crat expression in a moderate way  <cit> .

murine crat gene  had been mapped on chromosome  <dig> next to the protein phosphatase 2a, regulatory subunit b  gene . no detailed promoter studies have been published so far, but pparα plays a key role in crat transcription control  <cit> . so we hypothesized that a cooperative interplay between l-carnitine and pparα positively influences crat expression.

RESULTS
l-carnitine and pparα induce murine crat expression
the l-carnitine levels in the fcs after dialysis against phosphate buffered saline for 48 h dropped significantly from 36 μm to 16 μm . in a direct consequence the intracellular l-carnitine levels after cultivation in dialyzed fcs were reduced more than 70% and after l-carnitine supplementation could be restored to more than 70% of the original level of 973 μm l-carnitine . under these cell culture conditions we performed our l-carnitine deprivation/supplementation studies.

our first experiments examined the regulation of the murine crat gene by l-carnitine and fenofibrate. crat mrna levels were increased by l-carnitine supplementation  after artificially induced l-carnitine deficiency . additionally we tested the influence of 80 μm l-carnitine on mucrat mrna levels up to 48 hours after supplementation. after 4 hours the first peak of crat mrna levels was detected . a second application rate of 80 μm l-carnitine was added after 15 h and lead to even higher crat mrna levels.  . also the pparα-agonist fenofibrate induced mucrat up to 11-fold  .table  <dig>

l-carnitine raises pparα presence in the nucleus
pparα protein levels in the nucleus increase constantly after l-carnitine supplementation . already 4 hours after l-carnitine supplementation slightly increased levels of pparα levels are detectable in the nucleus  and gets more distinct after longer supplementation periods  and/or fenofibrate  supplementation. the cultivation in dialyzed fetal calf serum slightly reduces the tib <dig> crat protein levels and subsequent l-carnitine does not really influence the steady state crat protein. only fenofibrate is able to increase it distinctly.figure  <dig>

l-carnitine increases crat promoter activity

analysis of the murine crat 5′ flanking sequence
the murine crat promoter and its putative cis-regulatory elements for nuclear factors are depicted in figure  <dig>  analysis of the 5′-flanking region of exon  <dig> revealed several putative transcription factor-binding sites. most importantly a rxrα element was found at −228 bp to −222 bp. the crat promoter is a tata-less one with two sp <dig> binding sites. further on the 5′ promoter region harbors binding sites for hes- <dig>  creb, cac-binding protein and at last a pparα site within the first exon.

l-carnitine raises binding affinity of nuclear extracts to rxrα probe – anti-pparα antibody abrogates this dna-protein formation
to gain more insight into the binding affinities of nuclear extracts to different probes representing the putative transcription factor binding sites we performed several emsas. nuclear extracts of tib- <dig> cells were prepared after 4 h of l-carnitine supplementation at different concentrations. emsa analysis of the dna probe representing the rxrα binding site revealed increased affinity of nuclear extracts to this odn with rising l-carnitine concentrations. additional administration of anti-pparα antibody  directly to the emsa reaction mix lead to weakening of the band shift signal at 40 μm l-carnitine and nearly to extinction of the signal at 80 μm l-carnitine . based on this result we concluded that l-carnitine influences transcriptional activation via pparα.figure  <dig>

further on we performed southwestern blotting to gain more information about the complexity of the protein factors binding to this specific rxrα promoter element. we received three distinct signals at 51 kda, 70 kda and 145 kda. a search in the transfac database via molwsearch  presented lxrα and pparα as candidate factors for the 51 kda signal, c-myb and cmyc as putative factors for the 70 kda band and evi- <dig> for the 145 kda signal .figure  <dig>

discussion
no detailed promoter study of the murine crat promoter has been published so far. basically the crat gene exhibits the typical characteristics of a housekeeping promoter: it harbours no tata box, is gc rich and has two sp <dig> binding sites. the distance to the transcriptional start of the opposing ppp2r <dig>  which is encoded on the complementary strand, is only 586 bp. this leads to the reasonable postulation that this promoter very likely is a bi-directional one. for the human ppp2r <dig> promoter it could be shown that yin-yang  <dig>  is essential for core promoter activity and that it is a p <dig> target gene  <cit> . by applying tess we could find three yy-elements, two at positions − <dig> to − <dig> and + <dig> to + <dig> relative to the ppp2r <dig> transcription start and a third one already in the first exon of the ppp2r <dig> gene. these putative yy-binding sites very likely represent the murine equivalents to the human promoter .

one aim of our work was to identify inducers of transcriptional activation of crat. as depicted in figure  <dig> l-carnitine and fenofibrate are such transcriptional activators. l-carnitine induces crat and other members of the “acylcarnitine shuttle system” like cpt1a and b, as well as cpt <dig> transcription levels in the human system similar to mice  <cit> . beyond that, in a parallel chip-screen study performed by our lab, we observed that hundred of genes throughout the whole genome are transcriptionally in- or decreased by l-carnitine, underlining the importance of this metabolite  <cit> . in case of the murine crat we observed a rather moderate increase of mrna levels  after 4 h of l-carnitine supplementation following artificially induced l-carnitine deficiency. the above-mentioned opposing ppp2r <dig> gene is transcriptionally induced by l-carnitine and fenofibrate very similar to the crat gene as shown in the human liver cell line hep g <dig> , which is another argument for the bi-directionality of the promoter.

the important hyperlipidemic drug fenofibrate is a much more potent inducer of crat transcription levels . but no firm indications exist for a ppre element in crat promoter from bioinformatical analysis. this was also assumed for cpt1a and cpt <dig>  <cit> , but for the latter ppres could finally be defined  <cit> . cpt <dig> hosts a special ppre, namely only one half proportion with perfect consensus sequence   <cit> . our results undoubtedly prove that mucrat is a pparα target, as it has also been indicated in experiments with pparα knock-out mice  <cit> .

by reportergene assays we were able to define an l-carnitine sensitive region within 342 nt upstream the transcription start . within this sequence many different putative binding sites for nuclear factors were predicted in silico. our band shift experiments clearly revealed one rxrα element to be sensitive to l-carnitine supplementation.

based on our data we propose the sequence tgaccccgtgacgg at − <dig> upstream the transcription start to be a possible l-carnitine sensitive rxrα/pparα binding site. band shift assays performed with an oligo desoxynucleotide carrying only the 5′-half of this sequence element showed sensitivity to l-carnitine supplementation. at least the sequence box tgacc is present in the crat l-carnitine binding site, therefore we propose in analogy to the cpt <dig> gene this sequence element being a further imperfect but functional ppre site. increasing l-carnitine levels lead to enhanced binding affinity of nuclear extracts. interestingly the application of anti-pparα to the band shift reaction mix lead to a mitigation of the band shift signal. with increasing l-carnitine supplementation levels the band shift signal almost disappeared, indicating the interference of anti-pparα with the dna-protein complex. such fading out effects have been observed before and were accepted as an experimental proof for a supershift  <cit> . to rule out that this explicit attenuation effect was an unspecific one, caused by the use of antibodies in general, supershift assays were performed with antibodies against several candidates of nuclear receptors . these validation experiments did not result in any significant changes of the dna-protein formation except for pparα. therefore this effect had to be qualified as a specific interaction.

in addition to this effect we were able to reveal an additional close connection between the ppar-system and l-carnitine. transcription levels of ppar-binding protein, pparbp, are also inducible by l-carnitine. chip screen experiments as well as quantitative pcr also provided experimental proof for this effect  <cit> . li jl et al. found experimental proof for an interaction of pparα and l-carnitine as a protective response to oxidative stress  <cit> . this finding provides additional support to our observations that l-carnitine shows cooperativeness with the ppar-system. this supposition is strengthened by the results of the western blot depicted in figure 2a: l-carnitine supplementation leads to increased levels of pparα in the nucleus. obviously increased l-carnitine levels foster the translocation of pparα into the nucleus. it is of fundamental nutrigenomic importance that rxrα/pparα heterodimers are positively regulating transcription rates of fatty acid degradation genes as counterparts to lxrα and srebp1-c, factors which mostly induce anabolic acting fatty acid synthesis genes  <cit> .

carnitine acetyltransferase is a central regulator of intramitochondrial acetyl-coa pools. the latter holds a prominent position in intermediary metabolism as the universal end product of fatty acid, glucose and amino acid oxidation  <cit> . acetyl-coa excess leads to blockage of the tca cycle and subsequently to accumulation of short carbon compounds, which are further on used for gluconeogenesis in liver  <cit> . this is besides insulin resistance another factor of the pathogenesis of niddm  <cit> .

recently the pivotal role of crat in acetyl-coa metabolism was confirmed since experiments with cratm−/− knock-out mice showed that absence of crat leads to accumulation of medium and long chain acylcarnitines in muscles and subsequently to glucose intolerance via overloaded mitochondria  <cit> . these findings indicate a possible positive effect of l-carnitine and fenofibrate in the regulation of glucose homeostasis via direct transcriptional activation of crat, the first due to a metabolic interaction and the latter based on its pharmacology. singular and combined administration of these two compounds should be evaluated in controlled clinical trials in order to verify our findings in vivo.

the interaction of l-carnitine and pparα as we could show is of transcriptional importance. therefore the growth condition where this collaborative interplay is able to trigger the genome deserves deeper investigation. l-carnitine could already be identified as a nutritional modulator of glucocorticoid receptor functions  <cit> . in our electrophoretic mobility assays we also observed a slight induction at one of the glucocorticoid responsive elements  at position − <dig> to − <dig> of the crat promoter, after l-carnitine supplementation, but to a much lesser extend as at the rxrα/pparα binding site . thus possible interactions of l-carnitine with other nuclear receptors like pparα and gre and its molecular basis are worthwhile being investigated in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our investigations we could present a complete study of the murine crat promoter and provide strong evidence for a cooperative interplay of l-carnitine and pparα for its transcriptional regulation, which undoubtedly is of nutrigenomical importance. reportergene and electrophoretic mobility assays located a l-carnitine sensitive region within 342 nt upstream the transcription start, that contains one rxrα/pparα element which is directly responding to l-carnitine supplementation. super shift assays performed with a polyclonal antibody demonstrated that the mucrat gene is a pparα target. these evidences are strengthened by our findings that transcription levels of the ppar-binding protein  are also inducible by l-carnitine. a direct comparison of l-carnitine with the drug fenofibrate revealed, both are inducers of crat transcripts, with one implication that the hyperlipidemic drug fenofibrate exerted a more pronounced effect, based on its pharmacological interaction. within the investigated crat promoter sequence a variety of different putative binding sites for nuclear factors were predicted in silico and verified by experimental approaches. thus possible interactions of l-carnitine with other nuclear receptors like pparα and gre and its molecular basis are worthwhile being investigated in the future. we also could append facts for the bidirectional function of the crat promoter in conjunction with the opposing ppp2r <dig> gene.
