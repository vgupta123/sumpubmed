BACKGROUND
over the last two decades novel assemblies obtained from particles and lipids have been introduced as important tools to novel applications in drug and vaccine delivery  <cit> . particulates such as silica, latex or hydrophobic drugs have been coated by lipids and successfully employed in biomolecular recognition  <cit>  drug delivery  <cit>  and antigen presentation  <cit> . the systematic and quantitative evaluation of particle-lipid interaction has been realized by means of adsorption isotherms of lipids on particles, effects of lipids on particle size and zeta-potential from dynamic light scattering methods and determination of colloid stability from turbidity kinetics or particle sedimentation over time  <cit> . cationic lipids, in particular, are especially interesting to cover particles, since cationic particles may electrostatically combine with a vast variety of oppositely charged biomolecules, cells or other biological structures. cationization, in general, has often been explored as a convenient approach to target active biomolecules into cells  <cit> .

the control of lipid assembly on particles turned out to be dependent on properties of the intervening medium, eg ionic strength, and on the proportion of surface areas for bilayer vesicles and particles in dispersion  <cit> . from equivalence of total surface areas for particles and cationic lipid bilayers, over a range of low ionic strength, a good colloid stability was reported for the bilayer-covered cationic particles  <cit> .

in this work, the interaction between silica previously coated with cationic bilayers of dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide   <cit>  and the model protein bovine serum albumin  is investigated aiming at antigen presentation to the immune system by silica-based cationized particles. bsa choice was due to various reasons: its extensively studied adsorption behaviour at interfaces  <cit> ; its utility to prevent nonspecific binding in biosensing and proteomics applications  <cit> , its conformational adaptability as a "soft" globular protein  <cit> , its thoroughly investigated adsorption onto hydrophobic or hydrophilic particles sometimes resulting in exchange between the adsorbed and dissolved states  <cit>  and its substantial adsorption onto cationic and large dodab vesicles  <cit> .

the  <dig> kda-hsp protein belongs to a conserved protein family of m. leprae heat-shock proteins that display pronounced immunogenicity and are considered important targets of the immunoresponse to mycobacteria and, as such, relevant to subunit vaccine design. peripheral blood mononuclear cells and t-cell lines from m. leprae vaccinated subjects proliferated in response to this protein  <cit> . furthermore, overexpression and scaling-up of  <dig> kda-hsp production in saccharomyces cerevisae has already been described so that this protein is available in sufficient amount for a complete physico-chemical study of the adjuvant-antigen interaction  <cit> .

the dodab cationic lipid and its assemblies in water dispersion have been established as effective immunoadjuvants able to stimulate dendritic cells and often employed to present antigens  <cit> . silica particles are biocompatible, represent a reference adsorbent, offer a chemically well defined surface and are widely used as a chromatographic stationary phase  <cit> .

we have recently combined the typical property of particles that stimulate dendritic cells uptake with the adjuvant effect of dodab by using supported dodab bilayers on latex to present antigens  <cit> . here we take advantage of the biocompatible character of silica  <cit>  to produce dodab-covered silica particles for further immobilization and presentation of two different model antigens: bsa and  <dig> kda-hsp protein.

RESULTS
coverage of silica particles with a cationic bilayer and bsa adsorption
charge density on silica particles increases with ph and ionic strength  <cit>  so that electrostatic attraction between dodab bilayer and silica is substantial over the 1– <dig> mm range of monovalent salt concentration, and leads to dodab bilayer deposition onto particles  <cit> . one should notice that poor or none dodab adsorption on silica was previously reported for pure water as intervening media  <cit> . therefore, the experiments in this work were designed either at  <dig> or at  <dig> mm monovalent salt.

the dodab bilayer in closed vesicles is in the rigid gel state at room temperature. this represents an important limitation regarding deposition of bilayers onto particles hampering the occurrence of vesicle disruption which is essential for bilayer deposition. we have previously shown that closed vesicles with bilayers in the gel state do not disrupt upon contact with silica particles  <cit> , thus, in this work, bilayer deposition on silica is obtained by employing disrupted vesicles or bilayer fragments.

both at  <dig> mm nacl, ph  <dig> , and at  <dig>  mm tris.hcl, ph  <dig> , the dependence of size and zeta-potential of silica particles on dodab concentration shows size minimization and zeta-potential maximization at and above  <dig>  mm dodab . therefore,  <dig>  mm dodab was the final concentration selected to cover silica particles at  <dig>  mg/ml with one dodab bilayer. theoretically, assuming  <dig>  nm <dig> as the dodab area per molecule at the air-water interface and 26– <dig> m2/g as silica specific surface area, the dodab concentration required to cover silica particles at  <dig>  mg/ml with one bilayer would be  <dig> – <dig>  mm dodab, in reasonable agreement with the  <dig>  mm dodab experimentally determined for minimization of particle size and maximal zeta-potential . the bell-shaped dependence of zeta-average diameter of particles as a function of the logarithm of dodab concentration shows the occurrence of two regions of high colloidal stability identified by low sizes and large zeta-potentials in modulus: one at negative and the other at positive zeta-potentials both at mean sizes similar to the one of bare silica and over a range of low and high dodab concentrations .

the stability of the silica/dodab system was sistematically described in a previous work  <cit> . the adjuvant system is very reproducible yielding always the same mean dz and zeta-potential for the same final silica and dodab concentrations. however, upon antigen addition, zeta-potential may decrease to values close to zero so that colloid stability will be low.

size distributions for bsa aggregates, silica/dodab and silica/dodab/bsa particles are on figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> for dispersions in  <dig> mm nacl, ph  <dig>  and in  <dig> mm tris.hcl, ph  <dig> , respectively. interestingly enough, increasing bsa concentration from  <dig> up to  <dig> μg/ml, colloid stability rapidly decreased for the latter environment yielding aggregates with ca.  <dig>  μm mean diameter and zeta-potentials close to zero . the moderate electrostatic attraction in  <dig> mm nacl, ph  <dig>  produced higher colloid stability for silica/dodab/bsa assemblies given their positive charge even at the largest bsa concentration  . however, we privileged the largest adsorbed amount of bsa obtained in tris.hcl, ph  <dig>  for testing immune response.

silica-based cationic bilayers for induction of humoral immune response
vaccines based on recombinant protein antigens require an adjuvant to elicit an immune response  <cit> . the most popular, widely used and the only currently fda-approved adjuvant class in the usa is represented by aluminum salts  <cit> . among these, aluminum hydroxide has a point of zero charge at ph 9– <dig> so that below this range, particles are positively charged  <cit> . for the sake of comparison, size distributions and zeta-potentials were obtained under similar conditions both for aluminum hydroxide and for silica/dodab particles . aluminum hydroxide presents a low colloid stability in the presence of bsa as depicted from the large mean particle sizes obtained both for positively or negatively charged final assemblies with bsa. the comparison with silica/dodab data in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  clearly points out the adequacy of the silica-based supported cationic bilayers as more stable adjuvants from the point of view of colloid stability.

the immunoadjuvant effect of silica-based supported cationic bilayers was evaluated as compared to controls both from the point of view of igg antibody production and cellular immune response as detected from delayed-type hypersensitivity  reaction  <cit>  in mice after immunization and challenge. silica/bsa, dodab/bsa or silica/dodab/bsa induce weak igg production that can be ascribed to nonspecific antibodies given the 1: <dig> serum dilution employed . similarly, the 1: <dig> serum dilution employed to obtain igg production elicited by silica/dodab/ <dig> kda-hsp revealed a weak humoral response against this antigen . interestingly enough, there is no difference between silica/dodab/antigen and dodab/antigen in terms of antibody responses in the case of  <dig> kda-hsp . we have recently explored this to systematically study the interesting property of dodab bilayer fragments as antigen nanocarriers by themselves. they are also able to induce good cellular immune responses at very low dodab concentrations . the absorbance values in figure  <dig> are very low and within the range of nonspecific responses to both antigens and might be related to the antigen preference for self-aggregation in solution instead of adsorption onto the particles as depicted from the large sizes of proteic aggregates in solution . the immune responses to the recombinant  <dig> kda-hsp from mycobacterium leprae were studied in different presentations: free, copolymerized with bovine serum albumin in aggregates , and either surface linked to liposomes or entrapped into liposomes  <cit> . measuring the antibody production of immunized genetically selected mice has compared the adjuvant effects of liposomes and proteic copolymer. among the two liposome preparations, the strongest response was obtained with the surface-exposed antigen-liposomes <cit> .

 animals were sensitized with different systems and footpad swelling was elicited on the 5th day pos-immunization.

silica-based cationic bilayers for induction of cellular immune response
the adsorption of  <dig> kda-hsp onto bare silica or onto silica/dodab particles was quantitatively evaluated over a range of  <dig> kda-hsp concentrations in the mixtures . it was interesting to notice the distinctive shape of adsorption isotherms for both particulate systems: whereas the cationic particulate produced adsorption of high affinity leading to a plateau maximum , bare silica changed the adsorption curve to a typical competitive adsorption profile with protein-protein interaction inducing protein desorption from silica and leading to null adsorption over the high protein concentration regimen . this result emphasizes the importance of cationic character of the particulate for maintaining antigen adsorption on particles.

the  <dig> kda-hsp is similar to bsa in the sense that it tends to form large aggregates in water solution . in figure 10a, this aggregation is characterized at  <dig>  mg/ml of  <dig> kda-hsp concentration indicating negatively charged aggregates  with  <dig> nm of mean hydrodynamic diameter. adding protein at  <dig>  mg/ml of final  <dig> kda-hsp concentration to the silica/dodab particles produced a positively charged particulate with  <dig> nm of mean diameter and zeta-potential of  <dig> mv . increasing final  <dig> kda-hsp by ten times up to a final concentration of  <dig>  mg/ml led to large colloidal instability and mean diameter  due to occurrence of a zeta-potential close to zero  . therefore, for assaying the dth immune response, the protein concentration chosen was intermediary at  <dig>  mg/ml . the dth response induced by silica/dodab/ <dig> kda-hsp after sensitizing the mice with  <dig>  mg/ml  <dig> kda-hsp was excellent and higher than the one elicited by alum adjuvant under analogous conditions . in agreement with the dth response, cytokines production, especially inf-γ, revealed the superior character of the silica/dodab adjuvant in comparison to alum . therefore, the silica/dodab/antigen system is prone to be used as a biocompatible cationic adjuvant for antigen presentation and vaccine design. much larger biomimetic crystals composed of hydroxyapatite or urate with several micrometers of mean diameter and diverse crystal shapes revealed their robust effect on the expression of cd11b, mhc-class ii and cd  <dig> on peritoneal macrophages systems  <cit> . the system described in this work is also expected to provide a variety of shapes since silica particles are forming aggregates from primary particles of  <dig> nm mean diameter. indeed manipulation of the physico-chemical features of the particulates provides means of controlling the innate immune response.

CONCLUSIONS
supported cationic bilayers built on silica can effectively adsorb antigens to elicit superior immune responses in vivo. they can be prepared from a tiny amount of cationic and inexpensive synthetic lipid, just enough for covering silica particles with a cationic layer. the main advantage of this adjuvant system is precisely this low amount of cytotoxic cationic lipid employed in comparison to cationic liposomes usually used over a range of millimolar concentrations. regarding physical properties, silica/dodab particulates are less polydisperse than alum allowing better antigen presentation and eliciting superior cellular immune responses. therefore, cationized silica is a biocompatible, inexpensive, easily prepared and possibly general immunoadjuvant for antigen presentation which displays higher colloid stability than alum and better performance regarding cellular immune responses.
