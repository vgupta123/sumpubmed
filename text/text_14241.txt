BACKGROUND
influenza a viruses have a wide host range for birds and mammals, posing a major threat to animal health as well as a zoonotic threat to humans  <cit> . influenza pandemics can arise from genetic reassortment between avian and human influenza viruses or alternatively by the direct adaptation of avian or mammalian viruses to efficient human to human transmission  <cit> . swine influenza is a major respiratory problem in pigs; in uncomplicated infections the condition is usually mild to moderate and non-fatal, with complete recovery within  <dig> weeks after the onset of clinical signs. the  <dig> pandemic h1n <dig> virus in experimentally infected pigs has been shown to produce similarly mild to moderate signs and pathology  <cit>  as in most human cases of the same virus. the pig is often described as a mixing vessel for the reassortment of influenza viruses from different host species  <cit> . indeed, the  <dig> h1n <dig> pandemic virus has been shown to have originated from viruses of pig, avian and human origin  <cit> . a major determinant of influenza infection is the presence of virus receptors on susceptible host cells to which the viral haemagglutinin is able to bind. avian influenza a viruses preferentially bind to sialic acid α <dig> -galactose  linked receptors, whereas human strains bind to sialic acid α <dig> -galactose  linked receptors  <cit> . as the porcine respiratory tract is the main predilection site for influenza infection and the porcine trachea possesses both sa receptors  <cit> , the pig appears well placed to act as a vehicle for virus reassortment.

although the pig is an important host species of influenza virus infection and in the evolution of the virus to cross species barrier, there is still no detailed information on the expression of its sa receptors. knowledge of the distribution of sa receptors in the pig could facilitate our understanding of the pathogenesis and pathogenicity of the virus in the host. although conventional swine and human influenza viruses are usually not life threatening in their respective host, the outcomes of highly pathogenic avian h5n <dig> infections in humans and pigs are very different. the mortality rate of human cases of h5n <dig> infections is in excess of 60%  whereas the clinical effects of h5n <dig> in experimentally infected pigs are mild  <cit> . a comparative characterisation of the expression and distribution of sa receptors between pig and human may also provide an insight into differences in host response to the same virus. we report here on the relative expression and spatial distribution of saα <dig> -gal and saα <dig> -gal linked receptors in the major pig organs and make qualitative and functional comparisons with corresponding human tissues.

RESULTS
the lectins used were sambucus nigra agglutinin  which is specific for saα <dig> -gal , maackia amurensis i  and maackia amurensis agglutinins . the latter two are specific for saα <dig> -galβglcnac and saα <dig> -galβgalnac respectively  <cit> . overall, both human influenza  and avian influenza  receptor types were extensively detected in the major pig organs examined. each tissue showed distinctive spatial distribution of the two receptors.

sa receptors distribution in respiratory tract
along the upper respiratory lining of trachea and bronchus, sa α <dig> -gal receptor  was dominant in the ciliated pseudostratified epithelia, in which were found mucus secreting goblet cells . the relative abundance of sa α <dig> -gal receptor along the large airways continued down to the cuboidal epithelia of bronchioles. additionally, there was a gradual relative rise in expression of sa α <dig> -gal receptor  towards the lower respiratory lining, such that in the alveolar lining both sa α <dig> -gal and sa α <dig> -gal receptors were similarly expressed and with a degree of co-localisation of expression .

interestingly, in the lamina propria  of the respiratory tract, sa α <dig> -gal  was dominant over sa α <dig> -gal receptor . at these sub-epithelial locations, the less abundant sa α <dig> -gal receptor was mainly confined to mucous/serous glands. to further discriminate between sa α <dig> -gal receptor subtypes, maa i lectin glcnac specific) was used in comparison with the more commonly used maa ii lectin galnac detection). maa i receptor subtype was not detected in trachea and bronchus . however, maa i receptor was relatively more highly expressed than maa ii at the epithelial lining of the lower respiratory tract  .

sa receptors distribution along intestinal tract
in the duodenum, both sa α <dig> -gal and sa α <dig> -gal receptor types were detected . however, sa α <dig> -gal receptor  was weakly expressed, mainly confined to parts of the epithelial border. sa α <dig> -gal receptor  was dominant and localised along the epithelial border and in goblet cells. there was progressive increase of sa receptors towards the lower gut . in the colon, both sa α <dig> -gal and sa α <dig> -gal receptors were strongly detected on the epithelial border and in goblet cells. co-expression of the two receptors in goblet cells was also frequently observed. furthermore, there appeared to be an expression gradient of sa α <dig> -gal receptor along the column of goblet cells in the colon; more sa α <dig> -gal receptor was found in the crypt region than towards the luminal surface . to further discriminate between sa α <dig> -gal receptor subtypes, maa i lectin glcnac specific) was used in comparison with maa ii lectin galnac) binding. there was no maa i lectin binding in the duodenum . the weak presence maa i was mainly confined to a thin border along the colon epithelium .

sa receptors in other major organs
in the liver, sa α <dig> -gal receptor was most prominent along the sinusoid-hepatocyte boundary, suggesting that sinusoidal endothelial cells and/or kupffer cells could be the principal cell type for sa α <dig> -gal receptor expression . sa α <dig> -gal receptor  in the liver was mainly distributed in the connective tissue, such as around the portal triad region. in the brain, neuronal cells predominantly expressed sa α <dig> -gal receptor, with sparse presence of sa α <dig> -gal receptor that appeared to localise to meningeal blood vessels, presumably endothelial cells . in the spleen, both receptor types were diffusely expressed throughout the organ, with concentration of sa α <dig> -gal receptor in the pulp areas which are rich in lymphocytes . in the kidney, both sa α <dig>  and sa α <dig> -gal receptors were largely restricted to glomeruli, with the occasional sa α <dig> -gal positive tubular cells. the renal capsule as well as splenic capsule were sites of mainly sa α <dig> -gal expression. in skeletal muscle, sa α <dig> -gal receptor appeared to be confined to blood capillaries and sa α <dig> -gal receptor was detected along the basement membrane of muscle fibre .

correlation between influenza virus subtype and sa receptor type
to establish a functional correlation between sa receptor types and binding affinity of influenza virus subtypes , virus binding assays were performed on lung and tracheal tissue sections . as predicted, avian h2n <dig> and swine h1n <dig>  viruses bound to lung alveoli with similar affinity and with overlapping spatial distribution, consistent with the spatial arrangement of the two main sa receptor types. on tracheal sections, only swine h1n <dig> strongly bound along the epithelial border and specifically, but less strongly, to the ciliated pseudostratified epithelium. avian h2n <dig> virus showed little or no binding affinity for tracheal epithelium as was predicted.

discussion
to date, there has been no detailed account published on the distribution of sa receptors in the pig, an important mammalian host for influenza infections  <cit> . in this study, we found extensive presence of sa α <dig> -gal  and sa α <dig> -gal  receptors in the major organs examined which suggests that each organ is potentially a target for influenza virus entry or infection. in the porcine respiratory tract, sa α <dig> -gal receptor was dominant in the epithelia of the upper tract  . as the whole of the upper respiratory tract are architecturally identical, characterised by ciliated pseudostratified squamous epithelia interspersed with goblet cells and subepithelial structures of mucous/serous glands, we expect lectin binding patterns in the nasal turbinate and larynx to be highly similar to the reported trachea and bronchus. towards the lower epithelial tract , there was relative increase of sa α <dig> -gal  receptor, along with the continued presence of sa α <dig> -gal receptor . by contrast, sa α <dig> -gal receptor distribution  was widespread in the sub-epithelial mucosa of the respiratory tract , which suggests that the respiratory mucosa is potentially permissive to avian influenza virus replication if the epithelial lining is breached. our tracheal findings are broadly in agreement with a previous observation that avian and human receptors are located in porcine tracheal epithelium  <cit> . it should be pointed out that the source of maa lectin  used in that study and the likelihood of pig variation could account for its more intense detection signal compared with our use of a more specific maa ii lectin  <cit> .

our findings regarding sa receptor distribution along the porcine respiratory are similar to reported human data . in human trachea, sa α <dig> -gal receptor was abundantly expressed on ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells and sa α <dig> -gal receptor was only sparsely detected   <cit> . on human non-ciliated cuboidal bronchiolar epithelial cells sa α <dig> -gal receptor was readily detected  <cit> . in alveoli, sa α <dig> -gal receptor showed diffused expression in different cell types  whereas the greater prominence of sa α <dig> -gal receptor was restricted to type ii pneumocytes  <cit> . although in our pig study, no specific staining was made to distinguish the different cell types along the respiratory epithelia, the relative expression of sa α <dig> -gal and sa α <dig> -gal  receptors from trachea to alveolar region is a close match to the human pattern of expression. indeed, recent improvements in lectin-binding specificity and sensitivity have shown that sa α <dig> -gal as well as sa α <dig> -gal receptors are often both found in different cells types , unlike previous reports that indicated certain type of cells had only one lectin-binding profile  <cit> .

to further discriminate sa α <dig> -gal receptor binding, maa i and maa ii lectins were used. in porcine trachea and bronchus, maa i binding was undetectable. however, on the epithelial lining of porcine bronchiole and alveoli, maa i was more dominant than maa ii . the differential distribution of maa i and maa ii in pig appears to be different from human. in human, maa i shows widespread binding throughout the upper and lower respiratory tract, and maa ii binding was mainly restricted to the alveolar epithelial cells of the lung  <cit> . it has been suggested that in human cases of highly pathogenic avian h5n <dig> infection, the entry of h5n <dig> virus in the upper respiratory tract is mediated by maa i lectin specific receptors  <cit> . as domestic pigs are inherently resistant to h5n <dig> infection  <cit> , it is interesting to speculate that such resistance could be connected to the relative absence of maa i specific receptor on the porcine upper respiratory tract .

on porcine epithelia of small and large intestines, both sa α <dig> -gal and sa α <dig> -gal  receptors were clearly detected in goblet cells, as the main sa receptor cell type . there was more maa ii binding in the colon than duodenum. we further reported the presence of maa i binding in the colon but not in the duodenum . it is not apparent why goblet cells located in the colon crypts showed a greater abundance of sa α <dig> -gal expression than those in the apical region. the little available data on the characterisation of human sa receptors in the intestinal tract showed the absence of both sa α <dig> -gal and sa α <dig> -gal receptors in small and large intestines  <cit>  or absence of sa α <dig> -gal receptor in colon epithelium  <cit> . this is surprising given the abundance of mucin-secreting cells in the intestinal tract especially in colon epithelium. the reported lack or absence of sa receptors in human intestinal epithelia could be attributed to the preservation state of human gut samples and/or the use of less sensitive detection techniques for lectin binding. given that diarrhoea is not an infrequent presenting sign of influenza infection in mammals, such as avian h5n <dig> infection in humans  <cit>  and the  <dig> pandemic a/h1n <dig> infection in pigs  <cit> , there is a need for clarification regarding sa receptor distribution in the human gut.

the spatial distribution of sa α <dig> -gal and sa α <dig> -gal  receptors in porcine liver, brain, spleen, kidney and skeletal muscle closely resembled the distribution in human organs   <cit> . in human liver, sa α <dig> -gal receptors are found on hepatocytes and kupffer cells. in human brain, neuronal cells show abundance of sa α <dig> -gal receptor. in human spleen, both receptor types are localised to t- and b-lymphocytes . in human kidney, glomeruli are the foci of sa α <dig> -gal and sa α <dig> -gal expression. in human cardiac muscle, sa α <dig> -gal receptor is detected in endothelial cells  <cit> . these comparative observations suggest that the major organs examined in the pig, as in humans, are potentially susceptible to the viraemic spread of influenza virus, and that the brain could be particularly susceptible to virus encephalitis from an avian subtype  <cit> . in experimental pigs intra-nasally infected with a low pathogenic avian h5n <dig> subtype, virus recovery was made from the brain stem of  <dig> out of  <dig> animals which highlights neural tissues as potentially susceptible to avian influenza virus infection  <cit> . based on the extensive similarity in the expression and distribution of sa α <dig> -gal and sa α <dig> -gal  receptors between pig and human in the major organs, in particular, in the respiratory tract  it is suggested that the pigs are not more likely to act as "mixing vessels" for influenza virus reassortment between avian and mammalian subtypes than humans.

CONCLUSIONS
we established that both human influenza  and avian  receptor types are extensively present in all pig organs examined, with each tissue showing distinctive spatial distribution of the two receptors. this suggests that each major organ may be permissive to virus entry or infection. based on sa distribution similarity, pigs appear not more likely to be potential hosts for virus reassortment than humans. the relative abundance of sa receptors in the pig intestines highlights a need for clarification on the presence of sa receptors and their potential significance in the human intestinal tract.
