BACKGROUND
the adult drosophila eye consists of 750– <dig> individual unit eyes, known as ommatidia, which are arranged in a hexagonal lattice. each ommatidium consists of  <dig> photoreceptors,  <dig> lens-secreting cone cells and  <dig> primary pigment cells. ommatidia are separated from each other by secondary and tertiary  pigment cells, and by sensory bristles. each of these cell types occupies a stereotypic position within the lattice. pattern formation in the eye is initiated in the 3rd larval instar as a wave of morphogenesis sweeps across the epithelial cell layer in the eye imaginal disc. first, eight photoreceptor cells and four lens-secreting cone cells are specified through sequential inductive interactions. during early pupal stages, cone cells come to cover the photoreceptors. they also recruit two primary pigment cells, which surround the cone cells. cells that have not been specified at this stage form the interommatidial cell  lattice, which will ultimately be composed of secondary pigment cells, tertiary pigment cells, and bristles. these cells initially appear undifferentiated and unpatterned, with several layers of iocs often separating neighboring ommatidia. reorganization begins with presumptive lattice cells maximizing their contacts with primary pigment cells rather than with other lattice cells. this results in each lattice cell being connecting to at least two primary pigment cells, and with each ommatidia being separated by a single layer of lattice cells, arranged in an end-to-end chain. about two-thirds of these cells will go on to develop as secondary pigment cells, each of which makes up one face of the ommatidial hexagon, or tertiary pigment cells, which make up alternative vertices, with bristle groups making up the other vertices. the remainder of the iocs are eliminated by apoptotic cell death  <cit> .

much cell death in drosophila takes the form of apoptosis  <cit> . caspase proteases are the central executioners of apoptotic cell death  <cit> . dronc is required for many cell deaths in the fly  <cit> , including those of the iocs  <cit> . once activated through interactions with the adaptor ark, dronc cleaves and activates effector caspases such as drice and dcp- <dig> that are thought to bring about cell death  <cit> . drice is activated during the stages in which ioc death occurs  <cit> , and drice mutants lack some, but not all, ioc death, highlighting the importance of this protease  <cit> . diap <dig> is a cell death inhibitor that suppresses the activity of dronc and caspases activated by dronc through several different mechanisms  <cit> . reaper   <cit> , head involution defective   <cit> , grim  <cit> , sickle  <cit> , and jafrac <dig>  <cit> , known collectively as the rhg proteins after their founding members rpr, hid and grim, bind to diap <dig> through a short-n-terminal motif and disrupt diap1-caspase interactions through several mechanisms, each of which has the effect of unleashing a cascade of apoptosis-inducing caspase activity. flies that lack hid show defects in drice activation and ioc cell death  <cit> , while mutants for the other proteins are not available. together these observations suggest that ioc death is driven, at least in part, by hid-dependent inhibition of diap <dig>  which facilitates activation of dronc and drice .

ubiquitination, and thus presumably deubiquitination, plays several important roles in the regulation of this cell death pathway. diap <dig> is an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase  <cit>  that can ubiquitinate and inactivate dronc  <cit> . diap <dig> can also promote the ubiquitination and degradation of other pro-apoptotic proteins that it binds such as reaper  <cit> . diap <dig> also ubiquitinates itself  <cit>  and diap <dig> ubiquitination can be stimulated by the rhg proteins  <cit> . many components of the ubiquitin pathway have been identified as regulators of rhg-mediated cell death. examples include the ubiquitin activating enzyme , two components of an scf-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase  and the deubiquitinating enzyme fat facets  <cit> . however, the points at which these proteins work to regulate death are largely unknown.

as noted above, the iocs are initially arranged in double or triple rows between ommatidia in the pupal eye. iocs then rearrange in an end-to end configuration to form a single layer or row of cells separating primary pigment cells of different ommatidia. cell death only occurs after this rearrangement, or sorting, is complete. a key player in this process is the immunoglobulin family protein roughest . in the absence of roughest the iocs remain stacked side-by-side in multiple rows and ioc death does not occur  <cit> . rst is localized in iocs to the border between iocs and primaries  <cit> , in a process that requires de-cadherin and notch  <cit> . recent observations suggest that rst promotes sorting by physically interacting with hibris, another immunoglobulin family membrane protein expressed in primary pigment cells that is also required for ioc sorting and death  <cit> .

the egf receptor pathway provides important anti-apoptotic signals to iocs. loss of egfr signaling in the pupal eye results in fewer iocs  <cit> , while activation of egfr or ras promotes ioc survival  <cit> . egfr activation promotes ioc survival at least in part by negatively regulating hid levels and pro-apoptotic activity  <cit> . pro-survival signaling through the egfr is antagonized by notch-mediated signals , which are required to remove excess iocs  <cit> . the amount of contact an ioc has with primary pigment cells  as opposed to other iocs  is likely to be an important part of the calculus that determines ioc fate. ubiquitination plays important roles in regulating both signaling pathways. the egfr is monoubiquitinated following ligand binding, and this promotes receptor endocytosis and degradation, thus attenuating signaling  <cit> . in the notch pathway, monoubiquitination of both ligands and notch by multiple e <dig> ligases is associated with endocytic events that promote signaling. ubiquitination of notch by other e <dig> ligases is associated with internalization and lysosomal degradation  <cit> .

other proteins that regulate ioc survival have been identified. the runx dna-binding protein lozenge is required for ioc death  <cit> . lozenge pro-apoptotic activity is mediated by its ability to induce the expression of argos, a secreted inhibitor of egfr activation in cone cells, and 2° and 3° cells  <cit> . lozenge also activates expression of klumpfuss, a transcription factor with similarity to the wilm's tumor suppressor, in 2° and 3° cells  <cit> . klumpfuss function is required for normal levels of ioc death, and genetic evidence suggests that it antagonizes egfr signaling downstream of receptor activation  <cit> .

echinus , defined by a single allele, ec <dig>  was identified by calvin bridges in  <dig> as a x-chromosome-linked, recessive, rough eye mutant . more recently, wolff and ready showed that ec <dig> flies had decreased levels of ioc death, much like rst mutants. however, while ioc sorting failed to occur in rst animals, sorting was largely  intact in ec <dig> flies  <cit> . expression of the baculovirus caspase inhibitor p <dig> also prevents death but not sorting, giving rise to a pupal retinal phenotype with many similarities to  that observed in ec <dig> flies  <cit> . together these observations have suggested that ec acts primarily subsequent to sorting, perhaps regulating cell death directly  <cit> . to understand the role echinus plays in bringing about ioc death we generated a number of new echinus alleles and re-examined phenotypes associated with ec <dig> following extensive outcrossing to remove modifiers. multiple alleles, including putative null alleles, show defects in cell sorting as well as cell death. we cloned the echinus locus and found that it encodes multiple isoforms of a protein with homology to the ubiquitin specific protease  family of proteases. somewhat unexpectedly, versions of echinus that lack residues thought to be important for usp catalytic activity can rescue the echinus loss-of-function sorting and cell death phenotypes. we were unable to detect significant interactions between loss- and gain-of-function echinus alleles and a number of known or suspected regulators of ioc death. echinus may primarily regulate cell sorting, with loss of death being only a consequence of an earlier defect in this process. alternatively, echinus may regulate cell sorting and cell death, with regulation of death occurring at a novel point, perhaps through mechanisms that are independent of usp activity.

RESULTS
cg <dig> encodes echinus, which is expressed at low levels ubiquitously in the pupal retina
as a first step to cloning the echinus locus we used both ems mutagenesis and p element excision to generate new echinus alleles. we identified an x chromosome-linked p element insertion line, ecplacz, with a recessive rough eye phenotype that failed to complement ec <dig> . we generated a number of excisions of this element. the rough eye phenotype was reverted in some of these, indicating that the p element insertion was responsible for the echinus phenotype. the ecplacz transposon is located between cg <dig> and cg <dig>  suggesting one or the other of these genes as good candidates to encode echinus.

ommatidia from wildtype flies are arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern , and extra iocs are not observed in pupal eyes . in contrast, adult eyes of ec <dig> flies are rough , and extra iocs are present in the pupal retinas . to determine if cg <dig> encodes echinus we generated flies expressing dsrna corresponding to cg <dig> in order to trigger rnai-dependent knockdown of cg <dig> expression, under the control of the eye-specific-gmr promoter . consistent with this hypothesis, gmr-cg2904-rnai flies had a rough eye phenotype  and extra iocs . to create deletion alleles of cg <dig> we generated excisions from a nearby p element insertion line, ep <dig>  that is wildtype with respect to echinus . multiple excision lines were identified that had rough eyes as homozygotes. each of these failed to complement ec <dig> or ecplacz. breakpoints for four of these were determined, and each was found to delete sequences within the cg <dig> transcript. we have focused our analysis on one of these, designated ecepΔ <dig> . pupal eyes from ecepΔ <dig> also showed extra iocs . we found that the cg <dig> gene was also disrupted by the breakpoints of an excision allele generated from an alternate p element insertion . this mutant also had rough eyes and extra iocs . more recently, a number of new p element insertion lines in the surrounding genomic region have been identified  <cit> . several have a rough eye phenotype that fails to complement ec <dig>  and each of these is located near cg <dig> . we also identified several new ems alleles of echinus . we sequenced cg <dig> coding sequences from one of these and identified an e125-stop change in ec <dig> . we also identified a stop mutation  in the ems-derived ec3c <dig> allele  <cit> . finally, we sequenced cg <dig> coding and nearby regions from the original ec <dig> stock. two significant alterations were noted: an r295-stop mutation in the coding region, and a copia element inserted 3' to the transcript. tunel assays and/or anti-active caspase immunostaining conducted using ecΔ <dig>  ecepΔ <dig>  ecplacz, and ec <dig>  confirmed a reduction in apoptosis in mid-pupal retinas .

together, the above results strongly suggest that cg <dig> is echinus. to test this definitively we asked if expression of cg <dig> could rescue the echinus phenotype. we identified several cdnas for cg <dig> from a larval-pupal library . one of these, designated ec-sf <dig>  was introduced into flies under the control of the gmr promoter . these flies have wildtype-appearing eyes and ioc number , but when introduced into the echinus ecepΔ <dig> background, gmr-ec-sf <dig> restored adult ommatidial patterning and normal ioc cell death . rh <dig> represents a group of  <dig> kb cdna species that overlap echinus on the anti-sense dna strand. rh <dig> is predicted to be a non-coding rna, based on the lack of any reading frame of significant size. to test whether rh <dig> has any role in mitigating the echinus phenotype, gmr-rh <dig> was introduced into the fly . adult eyes of gmr-rh <dig> flies appear wildtype. in addition, when introduced into ecepΔ <dig>  gmr-rh <dig> failed to rescue or alter the echinus rough eye phenotype. together these observations demonstrate that cg <dig> , and not rh <dig>  encodes echinus.

pupal retinas from animals homozygous for new alleles of echinus such as ecepΔ <dig>  ecΔ <dig> and ec <dig>  as well as those from wildtype flies expressing gmr-cg2904-rnai, showed a striking difference from retinas mutant for ec <dig> . ec <dig> pupal eyes showed a significant increase in ioc number subsequent to the time when death normally occurs, and this increase was associated with only a modest level of side-by-side alignment of iocs   <cit> . one of the new ems alleles isolated, ec3c <dig>  which contains a stop codon near the c-terminus of the echinus coding region, showed a similar phenotype . ec3c <dig> is likely to be a partial loss-of-function allele of echinus since ec3c3/dfhc <dig> results in a stronger adult rough eye phenotype than that observed in homozygous ec3c <dig> flies . in contrast, pupal eyes from ecepΔ <dig> and gmr-cg2904-rnai , ecΔ <dig> and ec <dig>  showed a greatly increased number of iocs  and many of these extra cells were aligned side-by-side. the bloomington ec <dig> stock was outcrossed to wildtype flies for  <dig> generations in two independent experiments. interestingly, pupal eyes from both of these outcrossed lines showed an increase in the number of extra iocs  and ioc cell stacking . importantly, both sorting and death phenotypes were rescued by gmr-dependent expression of ec-sf <dig> for multiple echinus alleles . together, these observations suggest that the original ec <dig> line has picked up one or more suppressor mutations and that the true echinus null phenotype in the pupal eye results in extra iocs, with many of these cells being stacked side-by-side. in addition, there seems to be a direct correlation between the severity of defects in sorting and those in cell death. thus, pupal retinas from the original ec <dig> allele and ec3c <dig> displayed mild defects in sorting and ioc death, while retinas from the deletion allele ecepΔ <dig>  outcrossed ec <dig>  gmr-cg2904-rnai, and ecepΔ4/dfhc <dig>  , displayed much more severe defects in sorting and ioc death. these observations raise a question as to whether the echinus decrease-in-ioc death phenotype is a result of loss of echinus function as a death activator, or a secondary consequence of a failure in sorting, which precludes death signaling .

cdnas for echinus have been isolated from early embryos  <cit> , as well as pupal eyes , and genetic interactions between echinus and genes that result in phenotypes in tissues other than the eye have been described  <cit> . thus, it is likely that echinus is expressed in, and plays roles in tissues other than the eye, though our focus in this work is the pupal eye. to determine the echinus expression pattern in this tissue we carried out tissue in situ hybridizations on pupal retinas with an antisense echinus cdna probe. echinus transcripts could be detected at low levels in cone cells, primary pigment cells and iocs prior to, and during the period of ioc death . the ecplacz allele carries a version of lacz that functions as an enhancer trap. therefore, as a second, and perhaps more sensitive method of visualizing echinus expression, we examined β-gal expression in pupal retinas from this line. consistent with the results from echinus tissue in situ hybridizations, β-gal was expressed uniformly in cone cells, primary pigment cells and iocs in wildtype  pupal retinas . these observations do not exclude the possibility that echinus protein is differentially translated in specific cells, but they do suggest that transcription of echinus in specific populations of iocs is not a critical point of cell sorting or cell death regulation.

to explore the question of where echinus expression was required during pupal eye development we took advantage of a gal4-driver, ll54-gal <dig>  that is expressed predominantly, if not exclusively in primary, secondary and tertiary pigment cells, but not cone cells or bristles   <cit> . expression of ll54-gal <dig> in a wildtype background, in conjunction with a uas-driven mirna  targeting all echinus splice forms, phenocopied the echinus phenotype . we cannot exclude the possibility that low-level expression of the echinus-targeting mirna in other cell types in the eye is sufficient to generate this phenotype. this possibility notwithstanding, our observations suggest that echinus normally functions, at least in part, within the pigment cells to regulate ioc fate. interestingly, however, expression of either of two different splice forms of echinus , in an ecepΔ <dig> background, under this same promoter, failed to rescue the ecepΔ <dig> phenotype . this observation suggests, but does not prove, that echinus expression is also required in other cell types to bring about proper ioc sorting and death. analysis of echinus clones will be required to determine definitively the cell types in which echinus expression is required. finally, gmr-driven transgenes are expressed in all cell types in the developing eye  <cit> . as noted above , forced expression of echinus in all retinal cells did not by itself induce defects in sorting or ectopic retinal  cell death. this, in conjunction with the observation that endogenous echinus is expressed uniformly in the pupal retina, is consistent with a model in which echinus expression is not sufficient to induce the death of iocs, though it is necessary.

echinus gives rise to multiple splice forms that encode proteins with homology to ubiquitin-specific proteases
we sequenced multiple echinus cdnas and identified three splice variants  . in each of these, a common 3' coding and utr sequence is spliced to distinct 5' utr and coding sequences. to determine which splice forms are expressed during pupal retinal cell death, we conducted rt-pcr using exon-specific primers. we found that all isoforms were expressed in the pupal retina during the stages when ioc death occurred . no differences were seen when expression of different splice forms was monitored using tissue in situ hybridizations .

each splice form encodes a large protein of roughly  <dig> aa. blast searches identified only one region of homology with other proteins, an n-terminal usp domain, a domain found in one of the seven families of deubiquitinating enzymes . usp-containing dubs are cysteine proteases that are capable of removing ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins from substrates  <cit> . the usp domain features two short, well-conserved motifs – the cys box, which contains the essential catalytic cysteine, and a his box, which contains conserved his and asp residues that are thought to be essential for catalysis. structural studies on the usps hausp and ubp <dig> have revealed that the catalytic histidine and aspartic acid deprotonate the catalytic cysteine allowing for nucleophilic attack  <cit> . ec-sf <dig> encodes an usp domain with all the known essential catalytic residues . database searches identified genomic sequences that if spliced, would generate similar forms of echinus in multiple drosophila species as well as several other insects. outside of the arthropods echinus shows most homology with the mammalian dubs usp <dig> and usp <dig>  with essentially all of this homology occuring within the usp domain. most importantly for the purposes of this report, ec-sf <dig> and ec-sf <dig> encode proteins with truncated usp domains and lack residues important for catalysis. specifically, ec-sf <dig> and ec-sf <dig> contain the catalytic histidine and aspartic acid residues found in the usp his box, but they lack the cys box and its catalytic cysteine. ec-sf <dig> and ec-sf <dig> instead have alternative n-termini that are conserved in drosophilia and show no sequence similarity to the cys box motif . the homologous mammalian dub usp <dig> also encodes  <dig> alternative splice forms, two of which do not contain complete usp domains  <cit> .

echinus lacks usp activity on a model substrate, and usp activity is not required for echinus-dependent death of iocs
we generated flies expressing a microrna that targets ec-sf <dig> specifically, under the control of the gmr promoter. these flies showed an echinus-like adult rough eye phenotype, and pupal eyes contained extra iocs . in contrast, gmr-driven expression of micrornas designed to target ec-sf <dig> or ec-sf <dig> resulted in flies that appeared wildtype, and no extra iocs were observed . we cannot exclude the possibility that the micrornas targeting ec-sf <dig> and ec-sf <dig> failed to phenocopy echinus because they failed to induce a large enough decrease in splice form expression . nonetheless, our results from targeting ec-sf <dig> demonstrate that this splice form, at least, is important for bringing about ioc death, and suggest that it may be the most important for regulating ioc survival. also consistent with this hypothesis is our observation that gmr-driven rnai that targets all splice forms  results in a phenotype similar to that observed in flies in which only ec-sf <dig> was targeted . usp activity per se is unlikely to be sufficient for rescue, since the echinus sorting and cell death phenotypes could not be rescued by gmr-dependent expression of yeast ubp <dig>  a ubiquitin-specific protease known to be active on multiple substrates  <cit>  .

to test the hypothesis that ec-sf <dig> has deubiquitinating activity, we measured its ability to cleave a model ubiquitin-linked substrate, ub-arg-b-gal, a fusion protein of ubiquitin  and eschericia coli β-galactosidase , separated by an arginine  residue  <cit> . ub-arg-β-gal is a stable protein, and thus bacterial cells expressing it form blue colonies in the presence of the substrate x-gal  . deubiquitinating enzymes that remove ub create arg-β-gal, an unstable protein. thus, cells expressing ub-arg-β-gal, as well as an active deubiquitinating enzyme such as yeast ubp <dig>  give rise to white colonies in the presence of x-gal   <cit> . many deubiquitinating enzymes are active in this assay. however, in contrast to yeast ubp <dig>  expression of ec-sf <dig> or ec-sf <dig> in ub-arg-β-gal cells, in the presence of x-gal, resulted in the formation of blue colonies . the human proteins most homologous to ec-sf <dig>  usp <dig> and usp <dig>  also lack activity in this assay  <cit> . these results are consistent with models in which echinus, in particular ec-sf <dig>  lacks deubiquitinating activity. however, as discussed below , the failure to detect cleavage of a model substrate does not rule out the possibility that ec-sf <dig> has activity on other  substrates.

to test the hypothesis that echinus usp activity is required for its ability to bring about the death of excess iocs, we asked if expression of echinus splice forms that lack critical usp catalytic residues, ec-sf <dig> and ec-sf <dig>  could rescue the echinus phenotype. somewhat to our surprise, when introduced into the ecepΔ <dig> background , expression of ec-sf <dig>  or ec-sf <dig> , resulted in complete restoration of normal ioc death. these experiments involve gene overexpression and do not address the question of whether ec-sf <dig> or ec-sf <dig> is normally required for ioc death. however, they do demonstrate that echinus usp activity is unlikely to be absolutely required for ioc death, since these splice forms lack residues necessary for this activity.

echinus does not show significant genetic interactions with components of the core apoptosis machinery, or other pathways implicated in regulation of retinal cell death
our observations presented in fig.  <dig> indicate that null alleles of echinus have a previously unappreciated defect in cell sorting as well as cell death. the cell death defects observed in echinus mutants could simply be the indirect result of a failure in cell sorting. alternatively, echinus may play roles in both sorting and cell death. we have chosen to explore how echinus could be promoting the death of specific iocs. we searched for genetic interactions between echinus loss- and gain-of-function  and signaling pathways known to regulate ioc death. gmr-ec phenotypes in fig.  <dig> refer to ec-sf <dig>  similar phenotypes were observed with gmr-ec-sf <dig> . the rhg family protein hid is required for normal ioc death, as are the caspases dronc and drice. loss or overexpression of echinus had no significant effect on dominant eye phenotypes associated with gmr-driven overexpression of any of these molecules, or several other cell death activators including rpr, grim, debcl  or the caspases dcp- <dig> and strica . echinus loss- and gain-of-function also had no effect on a small eye phenotype associated with a partial loss-of-function in diap <dig> resulting from gmr-dependent expression of dsrna corresponding to sequences within the diap <dig> coding region   <cit>  .

we also failed to see interactions between loss and gain-of-function of echinus and mutations in several other pathways implicated in ioc death. these include the following: the egf pathway ; the runx transcription factor lozenge ; notch ; and jnk  . gmr-gal4-uas-klumpfuss was lethal in combination with gmr-ec. however, the significance of this interaction is unclear since expression of gmr-gal4-uas-klumpfuss alone resulted in only rare adults . finally, no interactions were observed between loss- or gain-of-function mutations in echinus and rst .

discussion
we showed that echinus, a gene required for normal ioc death, corresponds to cg <dig>  cg <dig> generates multiple transcripts, each of which encodes a protein with homology to the usp family of ubiquitin-specific proteases. echinus is necessary but not sufficient to cause ioc death when overexpressed. these results are consistent with models where echinus provides an activity that can modulate other signals that drive the death of specific cells , rather than providing death signals to specific cells. previous analyses of the ec <dig> allele led to a model wherein echinus functions subsequent to ioc sorting  <cit> . however, our analysis of multiple newly generated echinus alleles, including multiple likely null alleles, showed the presence of many excess ioc cells arranged in a side-by-side configuration with respect to primary pigment cells, in addition to excess cells arranged end-to-end. these observations are consistent with a model in which echinus functions to promote proper ioc sorting, with the failure in ioc death being a result of incorrectly positioned iocs being unable to send or receive cell death signals. an alternative possibility that we explored is that echinus plays roles in cell death signaling as well as cell sorting. we failed to observe significant genetic interactions between echinus and known or suspected death regulators. while these observations do not rule out the possibility that echinus acts to regulate death at a novel point, they tend to support models in which echinus functions primarily to regulate cell sorting.

homology searches of genome sequence in other insects suggest that echinus is conserved. but nothing is known about the functions of any of these genes. one splice form of echinus, ec-sf <dig>  encodes a protein that contains catalytic residues essential for usp activity. ec-sf <dig> is expressed in the pupal eye and splice form-specific rnai of this transcript phenocopied echinus. however, ec-sf <dig> was inactive in a deubiquitination assay utilizing a model ubiquitin-β-gal fusion protein substrate. this may reflect the fact that ec-sf <dig> is inactive as a usp. alternatively, echinus may only be active on specific substrates, a phenomenon observed with a number of usps  <cit> . it is also possible that ec-sf <dig>  as with several other usp family members, cleaves proteins modified with other ubiquitin-related proteins such as isg <dig>  <cit>  or nedd <dig>  <cit> . regardless of the answer to this question, our observation that splice forms of echinus that lack residues essential for usp activity rescue the echinus phenotype strongly suggests that ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like protease activity is not essential for echinus function, at least for bringing about the sorting and death of excess iocs. this does not mean that echinus functions are necessarily unrelated to regulation of deubiquitination. interestingly, like echinus, the genes usp <dig> and usp <dig> in human and mouse have a shorter splice form missing key catalytic residues and a longer form that includes these residues . also like echinus, the usp <dig> and usp <dig> long forms are inactive in a deubiquitination assay using a model ubiquitin-β-gal fusion protein substrate  <cit> . this conserved similarity in gene structure suggests a functional requirement for the multiple splice forms of echinus, despite the observed absence of protease activity. inactive versions of known usps can, in some cases, still bind ubiquitinated substrates, functioning as dominant negatives that block deubiquitination, thereby facilitating degradation or other events dependent on ubiquitin conjugation  <cit> . a number of components of the ubiquitin pathway regulate cell death in the fly eye, including the ubiquitin activating enzyme uba <dig>  the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase diap <dig>  two components of an scf-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase , and the deubiquitinating enzyme fat facets  <cit> . perhaps echinus promotes cell sorting and death by binding substrates modified with ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins, thereby blocking the removal of these modifications. alternatively, echinus could titrate cellular inhibitors of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteases. finally, it is important to emphasize that echinus's functions in sorting and cell death may be unrelated to ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins. some usps affect signaling through pathways which are independent of their ability to remove ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins  <cit> . central to addressing these questions is the identification of proteins bound by echinus in the eye.

as a first step in this direction we searched for genetic interactions between echinus and mutations in genes known or suspected to regulate ioc survival. egfr or notch, important upstream regulators of ioc survival. particularly in the case of the echinus overexpression experiments, our observations suggest that echinus is not sufficient on its own to regulate signaling through these pathways. we also searched for interactions between echinus and a number of known or suspected cell death effectors. these included rpr, hid, grim, and the caspases dronc, drice, and dcp- <dig>  for each of these genes, and for the eye-specific partial loss-of-function of diap <dig> induced using gmr-diap1-rnai, expression in the eye results in ectopic cell death. however, none of these phenotypes were significantly suppressed in the echinus loss-of-function background, or enhanced by echinus coexpression. perhaps echinus does not regulate these components, or components in the same pathways, at downstream points. however, there are several caveats to this conclusion. first, echinus is rare at the level of mrna, and thus presumably at the level of protein as well. therefore, it may simply be that loss of echinus, which normally regulates its target in the context of their much lower endogenous expression level, has little effect on phenotypes due to high-level target expression. second, in the cases where echinus was overexpressed, it may be that echinus requires cofactors in order to act on its targets, and these also may be relatively rare and rate-limiting. if true, overexpression of echinus might again be expected to have little effect on phenotypes associated with high-level expression of its target proteins. therefore, our observations allow us to conclude at most that echinus is probably not a rate-limiting, or dose-dependent regulator of the above death activators.

CONCLUSIONS
the echinus locus encodes multiple splice versions of proteins with homology to usp family proteases. but there is no clear evidence that regulation of ubiquitination is relevant to echinus's role in promoting ioc sorting and death. echinus did not show significant genetic interactions with a number of known death regulators, and expression of echinus was not sufficient on its own to induce ectopic death. together these observations suggest several possibilities. the first is that echinus regulates – but only in very specific contexts/cell types – unknown  upstream regulators or effectors of the core cell death pathway. alternatively, echinus may act as a necessary but not sufficient component in a parallel death signaling or effector pathway. finally, echinus may function primarily to regulate cell sorting, with failure in this process leading to cell survival because iocs are unable to effectively transmit or receive death signals. drawing links between echinus and any of these pathways requires the identification of echinus targets.
