BACKGROUND
over the years, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  has been increasingly reported in animals worldwide  <cit> . a specific clonal lineage, mlst st <dig>  has been found to be widespread among pigs in europe and north america, whereas st <dig> seemed to be predominant in asia  <cit> . several spa types were detected within these lineages with spa types t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> being the most frequent in mrsa st <dig>  and t <dig> in mrsa st <dig>  <cit> . colonisation with mrsa st <dig> was also described in other animals like poultry, horses, and calves, and recently, st <dig> has been associated with infections in animals and humans  <cit> . humans that come in close contact with farm animals were more likely to be colonised with livestock-associated st <dig> and had a higher risk of developing infections with st <dig> in case of hospitalisation  <cit> . the pig husbandry environment also represents a large reservoir for mrsa. mrsa st <dig> was recovered from dust samples in pig production holdings in europe with an average prevalence of  <dig> % varying between 0% and  <dig> % among the eu member states in  <dig>  <cit> . mrsa st398-t <dig> was the most dominant type , followed by st398-t <dig> , and st398-t <dig> .  <dig> % of the mrsa from this study were from seven other non-st <dig> strains . the majority of the non-st <dig> strains originated from germany and italy  <cit> .

in  <dig>  dust samples from pig husbandries in switzerland were analysed and did not contain mrsa  <cit> . in fact, there was no mrsa detected during previous studies in swiss slaughter pigs and pig carcasses before  <dig>  <cit> . however in  <dig>   <dig> mrsa st398-t <dig>  which contained the staphylococcal cassette chromosome sccmecv , were found among  <dig> nasal swabs from swiss pigs at two slaughterhouses; these results indicated that mrsa had also emerged in the swiss pig population  <cit> . that same year, an official monitoring of mrsa in pigs at the slaughterhouse was launched to determine the overall prevalence in the entire country. a sampling strategy for monitoring antimicrobial resistance was developed in  <dig>  which considered the geographical distribution and size of the slaughterhouses, and the number of slaughtered pigs in switzerland  <cit> . since  <dig>  this sampling plan was also used for monitoring mrsa. this study will determine the overall prevalence and dynamics of mrsa colonisation in the slaughtered pig population and will indicate if specific genetic lineages of mrsa are colonising pigs in switzerland.

RESULTS
increased prevalence and molecular typing
mrsa  were detected in samples from  <dig> of  <dig> slaughterhouses  in  <dig> and in  <dig> of  <dig> slaughterhouses  in  <dig> . mrsa was mostly found in pigs raised in cantons where the pig population is the highest , that is, thurgau , lucerne , st. gallen , bern , and aargau . single isolates were found in pigs from appenzell innen rhodes, jura, and zurich . in  <dig>  the prevalence of mrsa in swiss slaughter pigs was  <dig> %  with eight out of  <dig> pig nasal samples being positive and increased significantly  to  <dig> %  in  <dig> with  <dig> out of  <dig> nasal swabs containing mrsa. mrsa was detected every month in  <dig>  except in september, with up to five positive samples per month, whereas mrsa was only sporadically detected over the year in  <dig>

antibiotic resistance genes and their functions are indicated as follows: ant-ia, spectinomycin adenylnucleotidyltransferase; blaz, β-lactamase; dfr, dihydrofolate reductase; erm and erm, macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins b rrna methylase; meca, penicillin-binding protein pbp2a; str, streptomycin adenyltransferase; tet, tetracycline efflux protein; tet, tetracycline ribosomal protection protein; vgav, pleuromutilins and streptogramins a atp binding transporter.

nd, not detected; +, the mic values were greater than the resistance breakpoint, but the resistance mechanism remained uncharacterised; blank spaces indicate no resistance

with the exception of one isolate , most of the mrsa contained the sccmecv element . the eight mrsa isolated in  <dig> belonged to five genotypes: st398-t011-v , st398-t034-v , st398-t1451-v , st49-t208-v , and st1-t2279-ivc ; each isolate displayed a different resistance profile . in  <dig>  only three clonal lineages were identified with st398-t034-v  and st49-t208-v  being the most common, whereas st398-t011-v was only detected once .

mrsa isolated from a same slaughterhouse in  <dig> and  <dig> displayed a different genetic profile and were isolated at different days, except for some mrsa st398-t <dig> and st49-t <dig> isolates. they were also detected several times from samples from the same slaughterhouses at different days  as well as during the same sampling day in  <dig> . all samples originated from pigs raised in different husbandry .

resistance profiles
isolates belonging to the most commonly detected genotype, st398-t034-v, shared the same resistance profile; however, one isolate was susceptible to streptomycin and did not contain the streptomycin adenyltransferase gene str . otherwise, st398-t034-v isolates showed resistance to ß-lactams specified by meca and blaz, tetracycline , macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b  antibiotics , spectinomycin , streptomycin , trimethoprim , and tiamulin. the tiamulin resistance could not be attributed to either of the five known pleuromutilin-streptogramin a resistance genes vga, vgav, vga, vga, vga  <cit> , or to the cfr rrnamethylase transferase gene which confers cross resistance to phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidones, pleuromutilins, and streptgramin a antibiotics  <cit> . mutations in the  <dig> rrna and rplc gene were not investigated  <cit> .

different resistance profiles were observed among the st49-t208-v isolates, which was the second most prevalent lineage. the difference was mainly due to the presence, or absence, of either of the mlsb resistance genes erm or erm . in general, st <dig> isolates displayed resistance to ß-lactams , tetracycline , tiamulin , and sulphonamides . notably, st49-t <dig> isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim and resistant to sulphonamides, whereas st398-t <dig> isolates were resistant to trimethoprim and susceptible to sulphonamides.

different antibiotic resistance profiles were also found among the less frequent isolates, st398-t <dig> and st398-t <dig>  they all displayed resistance to ß-lactams  and tetracycline ; however, resistance to mlsb antibiotics , tiamulin , streptomycin , and spectinomycin varied from strain to strain . the st1-t2279-ivc isolate was only detected once and showed resistance to ß-lactams , tetracycline , mlsb antibiotics , and spectinomycin ; additionally, a resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected . the resistance mechanism to fluoroquinolones which may be due to mutations in the topoisomerase genes  <cit>  was not determined. in contrast, mrsa isolates from  <dig> and  <dig> were susceptible to vancomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, quinupristin/dalfopristin, fusidic acid, mupirocin, rifampicin, and linezolid; importantly, none of the isolates carried the panton-valentine leukocidin toxin.

discussion
molecular typing and epidemiology
this study was the first to reveal the presence of mrsa st <dig> in pigs. mrsa st <dig> was already present in  <dig>  but its prevalence increased in  <dig>  the presence of the new clonal lineage st49-t <dig>  which is unique to mrsa from pigs in switzerland, suggests that the selection occurred within the swiss pig population. this idea is supported by the fact that mrsa st <dig> was detected in seven different pigs from seven different farms slaughtered in three different slaughterhouses, and that st <dig> isolates displayed different resistance profiles mainly due to the acquisition of an additional erm or erm gene . the spa type t <dig>  which is associated with st <dig>  was previously found in seven out of  <dig> methicillin-susceptible s. aureus mssa from pigs in switzerland  <cit> , suggesting a possible acquisition of the sccmec element. st <dig> is rarely mentioned in the literature; it was not detected among  <dig> mssa and mrsa from human infections in the  <dig> eu countries, the  <dig> s. aureus colonising healthy adults in switzerland nor within the  <dig> mssa isolates from swiss children  <cit> . st <dig> has only been associated with mssa involved in one human infection in the united kingdom and in three cases of skin lesions and laryngeal ulceration in wild squirrels  <cit> . in the latter three cases, the authors mentioned close contact with persons who fed the squirrels as a possible source of infection. further screening of humans, including people working with food-producing animals, would be necessary to determine if humans also play a role in the dissemination of mrsa st <dig>  as demonstrated with st <dig>  human carriage of st <dig> has been widely documented in other european countries, and the exchange of st <dig> between humans and pigs has been reported in the netherlands and denmark  <cit> . furthermore, st398-t <dig> was the most predominant lineage found in swiss pigs, and has been detected in one out of  <dig> veterinarians in switzerland  <cit> . in our study, st <dig> was only detected once, although it has been associated with mrsa infections in humans in the united kingdom and spain, and in horses in austria  <cit> . st <dig> represented, however,  <dig> % of the mrsa-positive pig finishing holdings in italy  <cit> . cases of transmission of st <dig> between humans and cows have also been reported  <cit> .

transmission of mrsa among pigs during animal transport and at slaughterhouse has been described  <cit> . in our study, no direct association of sts to a specific abattoir has been observed, except for slaughterhouse a, where st398-t <dig> has been predominantly detected in the samples. transmission which may have occurred at slaughterhouse may not be excluded for this abattoir. otherwise, mrsa st <dig> and st <dig> were found in different slaughterhouses at different sampling dates and the pigs originated from different farms.

increase of mrsa prevalence
this study is also the first to describe mrsa prevalence in slaughter pigs in switzerland using a sampling plan which was representative of the swiss slaughter pig population and which was evenly distributed over time. this strategy allowed us to obtain statistically significant and representative data for the evaluation of the chronological distribution of mrsa. such representative sampling criteria were not considered in the two previous studies reporting mrsa in pigs in switzerland, resulting in a less accurate estimation of the prevalence over the entire country  <cit> . however, these studies indicated that the prevalence of mrsa was low among the proportion of pigs analysed before  <dig>  our study also showed that the prevalence of mrsa in  <dig> was low, and indicated an approximate three-fold increase within one year. the increased diversity of mrsa and the emergence of the clonal lineage st <dig> unique to mrsa from swiss pigs suggested that mrsa-positive pigs imported into switzerland have not introduced this mrsa. however, switzerland sporadically imports a low number of breeding pigs, from which mrsa st <dig> may have been introduced. in  <dig>  for example, switzerland imported pigs from denmark , the netherlands , and germany , where the prevalence of mrsa st <dig> is high . like switzerland, the predominant clone in denmark and germany is st398-t <dig>  whereas mrsa st398-t <dig> is the predominant in the netherlands  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
two predominant clonal lineages, st398-t <dig> and st49-t <dig>  are spreading within the swiss slaughter pig population. focus should be stressed on prevention of the transmission of these multi-resistant zoonotic bacteria from the farms into the community. human carriage of mrsa represents a new challenge for public health because people that are in the vicinity of animals have been shown to have a higher risk of developing a mrsa infection when hospitalised. targeted screening for mrsa in at-risk people, that is, farmers, veterinarians, and other people with close contact to animals, as recommended by harbarth et al.   <cit> , should be taken into account upon hospital admission. a study on mrsa decolonisation in humans with close contact to pigs showed a low efficacy due to continuous re-colonisation  <cit> . therefore, effective hygiene measures into the entire pig production chain should be maintained as proposed by the scientific advisory group on antimicrobials  <cit> . nevertheless, periodic monitoring of the mrsa in livestock animals at slaughterhouses is now established in switzerland at the national reference laboratory for antimicrobial resistance , institute of veterinary bacteriology, vetsuisse faculty, university of bern), for the surveillance of mrsa in the livestock population.
