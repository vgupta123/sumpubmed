BACKGROUND
tuberculosis, the disease caused by the pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis, is responsible for approximately  <dig> million deaths annually according to the world health organization  <cit> . at the moment, the genomic annotation of several lineages of mycobacterium sp. is available and largely validated  <cit> . however, the annotation of protein-coding genes is still a challenge in genomic sequencing projects despite advances in computational gene finding  <cit> . consequently, differences in gene annotation introduced by diverse prediction methodology will have a major impact on subsequent studies. in addition, the presence of overlapping genes further increases the difficulty of annotation, resulting in theoretical protein products with different lengths.

an example of such differences can be observed from the number of open reading frames  annotated for the h37rv laboratory strain of m. tuberculosis by two independent institutions  <cit> , representing a difference of up to 12%, simply in the number of annotated genes. in addition, there are differences in the lengths of genes annotated by both institutions due to difference in start codon choice. therefore, the validation of such annotations by identification of protein sequences is highly desirable to further refine the genomic annotations and enable generation of improved unbiased databases. mass spectrometry based proteomic approaches  is by far one of the most sensitive, high-throughput methods available for large scale screening of peptides present in a particular sample . such techniques have emerged to become instrumental in proteomic projects aiming for systematic functional analyses of the genes uncovered by genome sequence initiatives  <cit> . recently, ms-based approaches have been used to aid gene annotation in prokaryote and eukaryote genomes  <cit> , and to validate genomic annotation. deshayes et al.  <cit>  demonstrated, for example, that a mass spectrometry driven validation could identify sequencing errors of the genome of mycobacterium smegmatis that were mistakenly believed to be interrupted coding sequences.

the possibility for in-depth analysis of complex proteomes has been dramatically increased by recent developments in mass spectrometry-based proteomics  <cit> , in particular, by a hybrid mass spectrometry linear ion trap – orbitrap mass spectrometer  <cit> , in which ions are detected with high resolution by their motion in a spindle shaped electrode. it has recently been shown that, by using a 'lock mass strategy', very high mass accuracy is routinely achievable in both the ms and ms/ms modes  <cit> , which virtually eliminates the problem of false positive peptide identification in proteomics.

in this article, we compared the revised original annotation for m. tuberculosis strain h37rv from the sanger institute  <cit>  with the annotation of the same sequence from the institute for genomic research   <cit> . previous results from our group suggested that differences in annotation may lead to divergent proteomic characterization  <cit> , but such results were obtained using low-sensitivity, low-accuracy mass spectrometers. therefore, we now generated a proteomic dataset from m. tuberculosis h37rv culture filtrate acquired on a high-accuracy ltq-orbitrap instrument to improve identification coverage and reliability, and we specifically aimed to identify specific tryptic peptides represented in one or the other annotation.

tryptic peptides specific to one or the other annotation can be observed when a complete gene is described in only one of the annotations. specific tryptic peptides can also be observed when there is discrepancy in choice of the start codon of a particular gene. in that case, specific tryptic peptides can be seen in the n-terminal part of the longer gene. correct choice of start codon may also be confirmed by observation of the very n-terminal peptide with or without its first methionine.

our m. tuberculosis culture filtrates contain a high number of secreted proteins exported through the general secretory pathway  <cit> . in order to identify the n-terminal peptides of processed secreted proteins, where the signal peptide has been cleaved off, we used the signalp algorithm  <cit>  for identification of proteins with signal peptide, and the potential cleavage sites. choice of start codon may however influence prediction of signal peptides using most signal prediction algorithms, including signalp, because they consider the distance between the potential cleavage site and the precursor starting point. as a consequence, the n-terminal peptide of a mature secreted protein may not be detected if the choice of start codon precludes the prediction of the signal peptide  <cit> .

we designed a database containing predicted n-terminal sequences in order to improve the identification of peptides in this area. to avoid repetitive entry generation and high levels of redundancy, the database was organized represented in a concise, ms-friendly format as described by schandorff et al  <cit> . in order to determine the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and n-terminal predictions, these authors created a modified ipi human database where the tryptic peptide containing a possible mutation was inserted at the end of the original entry, but always preceded by the letter "j" . through this method they were able to test and identify several snps without compromising database size, redundancy and reliability of the results. therefore, all gene entries in the sanger and the tigr annotations were submitted to signalp v <dig>  prediction, and sites with a sufficiently high score were selected and appended to the entries as described by  <cit> .

in total, we were able to identify  <dig> proteins from the m. tuberculosis h37rv culture filtrate fractions , representing a more in depth scale of identification from the previous study  <cit> , a difference explainable solely on better ms instrumentation. from those, we detected and validated  <dig> peptides which were specific to one annotation,  <dig> of them were specific to the sanger annotation and only  <dig> was specific to the tigr annotation. in addition, the identified peptides resulted in the identification of  <dig> gene products whose genes are only annotated in the sanger dataset . these data represented  <dig> % of all peptides identified in the study, comprising a rather small protein population detected, indicating that such observations could be even more critical with a larger dataset. therefore, it is of significant importance to generate more precise, unbiased gene annotation datasets from m. tuberculosis to allow more efficient proteomic characterization.

RESULTS
proteomic description of the evaluated data
protein samples from m. tuberculosis h37rv culture filtrate were separated by 10% sds-page and each gel lane was excised in  <dig> fractions, as described previously by målen et al  <cit> . those bands were submitted to in-gel digestion and the resulting peptides were analyzed with a ltq-orbitrap mass spectrometer. figure  <dig> shows an example of a ms/ms spectrum of a peptide of m/z m+h =  <dig> . the mascot engine identified this spectrum as the peptide aaepswngqylvtlsanak, corresponding to the predicted n-terminal of the entry rv2253/nt02mt <dig> annotated as a ''conserved hypothetical protein'' . figure  <dig> also illustrates the fragmentation pattern and identification of y/b series on sequence . in this example mascot was able to correlate  <dig> of the possible  <dig> y ions for this sequence, and  <dig> of  <dig> b ions, resulting in an identification score of  <dig> 

all data acquired from the ltq-orbitrap were analyzed using mascot with two protein databases derived from sanger respectively tigr annotation of the m. tuberculosis h37rv lab strain. in total,  <dig> different proteins were identified in this study. this is two times more proteins and almost four times as many peptides identified as compared to previous results from our group on the same culture filtrates  <cit> . additional file  <dig> reports all peptides identified in this work, in addition to the protein entry to which each peptide belongs . the table also contains information about protein mass, peptide length, observed charge, observed mass over charge ratio, measured peptide mass  mascot score, the presence of modifications , the error of the observed/theoretical mass in ppm and a column showing the number of peptides per identified protein . sequences in red indicate peptides which were identified in only one of the databases, as also indicated in table  <dig> 

since our objective in this study was to scrutinize the differences between the databases, and not to generate a catalogative dataset, we allowed the validation of proteins identified with  <dig> peptide. while such criteria is rarely employed in proteomic studies, we argue that these peptides should be included in our analysis since they have been identified with a highly accurate instrument in an organism with a small genome and thus represent highly statistically significant results. therefore, the identified proteins in the additional file  <dig> were divided in  <dig> categories. first, all proteins with at least  <dig> peptides with minimal score of  <dig> , followed by proteins with only  <dig> peptide but mascot score higher than  <dig> , and finally,  <dig> proteins with  <dig> peptide with score between  <dig> and  <dig> . using such score criteria, we had no reversed hits being validated in the analysis , confirming that our dataset should have extremely low false-positive rates. however, it is important to note that we performed such category separation solely to help the reader to discriminate such identifications as lower confidence ones, and they are statistically acceptable.

sanger versus tigr annotation comparison
the initial comparison of sanger and tigr gene annotation datasets were mostly based on the fact that we were previously able to identify three proteins that were specific to one dataset  <cit> . in addition, there are several differences in the annotations which are available at the tigr comprehensive microbial resource website  <cit> . therefore, we decided to create a comprehensive list of genes annotated on each of the two datasets, and also to determine the genes specific to each. our alignment was based on genes that shared the same stop codon, independent of having different start codons. additional file  <dig> shows a list of  <dig> genes that share the same stop codon in both annotations. this table contains an alignment of the similar annotated genes of both datasets, indicating its position in the genome, the dna gene size, the protein product size, gc content ratio, the stop codon  for the gene, and if available the swiss-prot code. finally, we also calculated the difference in length of the equivalent annotated protein products .

from those,  <dig> had exactly the same base pair/protein sequence size, while  <dig>  had different start codons in the two datasets. strikingly, there are some extremely divergent annotations in terms of gene size, as can be seen for the tigr entries nt02mt <dig>  or nt02mt <dig> , which are  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids longer than the respective entries, rv1483c and rv <dig> in the sanger annotation. however, most of the differences are within the range  <dig> to 15% of the total sequence length. figure  <dig> illustrates the length distribution of the protein product of these similarly annotated genes, and it is clearly observable that the differences are equally distributed between datasets, i.e., both tigr and sanger contribute similarly to the differences observed, therefore initially eliminating the possibility that one of the datasets were generated through a less stringent methodology. for example, while tigr has  <dig> entries with longer genes, sanger has a slightly higher frequency of such cases, with  <dig> entries. however, the ratio of exclusive amino acid sequences per entry is higher in tigr  compared to sanger  .

n-terminal prediction and database generation
since most of the observable differences belong to the n-terminal side of the proteins, and based on the knowledge that exported proteins from m. tuberculosis can be submitted to n-terminal processing by a signal peptidase complex  <cit> , we were naturally concerned that a possible lack of capability to identify such differences could be a result from a database limitation to generate tryptic peptides which correspond to the post-processed n-terminal of the protein. this was already described by rison et al.  <cit> , who generated theoretical tryptic peptides to identify the correct tss of  <dig> proteins from m. tuberculosis. however, those authors chose a database setup which was redundant . this limitation was satisfactorily solved by schandorff et al  <cit> , where the authors designed a database where ''artificial'' tryptic peptides representing predicted n-terminal sequences from human proteins were inserted at the end of its respective protein entry, consequently allowing the identification of this peptide by mass-spectrometry.

to better identify peptides from the n-terminal region of the entries, we designed a similar ms-friendly database as cited above, where all entries that had a signal peptide predicted by the signalp tool v <dig>   <cit>  were modified to insert the post-processed sequence as a tryptic peptide j-tagged to the original sequence. this method is illustrated in figure  <dig>  in this example, the protein rv <dig> from the sanger dataset had the n-terminal predicted to start in position e <dig>  just after the sequence portion aaa, confirming an axa motif . while the peptide epswngqylvtlsanak is not originally a tryptic peptide in the entry , its chance of successful identification is non-existent. therefore, this peptide is re-inserted in the entry after a j letter  and mascot trypsin parameters are changed to consider the j code as a cleavage site of trypsin.

we also considered that additional cleavage sites could be preferred in the neighboring predicted site, or that the prediction was incorrect. therefore, as shown in figure  <dig>  we also inserted in the entry all possible tryptic peptides from the position - <dig> up to + <dig> of the predicted site, to achieve a better coverage of possible positions of n-terminal cleavage. in this study, we utilized this method on both the tigr and sanger datasets, in order to obtain a better chance to identify any exclusive peptides on the n-terminal side of the entries. a total of  <dig> peptides from  <dig> different proteins were identified and are listed in additional file  <dig> and marked as ''nterm'' on its left flanking amino acid category. from those  <dig> peptides, six peptides from proteins rv <dig>  rv3705c and rv <dig> are specific to one dataset. interestingly, for rv <dig> , we identified both the predicted n-terminal in e <dig>  as well as an additional sequence starting in a <dig>  . interestingly, the amino acid a <dig> is also following an axa motif, suggesting that in this case signal peptidase i may recognize and cleave at different portions of the same molecule.

specific tryptic peptides on sanger or tigr identified by lc-ms/ms
once we generated the peptide lists of the identified proteins from sanger or tigr databases, we compared them in order to determine the presence of peptides or proteins which are specific to one of the datasets. to characterize a peptide as such, it is relevant to point out that the observed sequence should be absent from similar entries representing the same gene, and should also be absent from other entries in the database or from the reversed sequences inserted as false-positive delimiters.

in total, we identified  <dig> peptides which were specific to one of the databases, representing a total of  <dig> different proteins . this table is a summarized version of additional file  <dig> showing only the specific peptides, their sequences, their mascot score, total number of peptides identified for that protein hit , in which database they were observed and finally the ppm error observed for the parental ion. while  <dig> of those specific-dataset peptides were identified for protein hits in conjunction with other peptides ,  <dig> of these peptides were observed given our identification criteria of " <dig> peptide per hit". however, those peptides had still a very high mascot score . in addition, the in silico trypsinization of the databases performed by mascot could not identify any other sequence-combinations that could fit with the observed spectra, when such a small mass error as  <dig> ppm was required on the database search .

surprisingly, the vast majority of specific peptides were observed in the sanger database, while only one peptide, from the protein rv3722/nt02mt <dig> was specific to the tigr database . in this figure, it is possible to observe the cid fragmentation pattern of the peptide hqqdyaalqgmk  from the protein aspartate transaminase, identified with a mascot score of  <dig>  this peptide had 9/ <dig> theoretical y ions detected, and 7/ <dig> b ions. below the ms/ms spectra, the alignment between the sanger  and tigr  annotation is shown, indicating that the identified sequence was only annotated as part of the aspartate transaminase gene in the tigr dataset .

most of the differences were due to differences in n-terminal annotations, but  <dig> of these  <dig> proteins were also specific to sanger, while their peptides and the corresponding genes were not annotated in the tigr database. figure  <dig> represents one of these proteins, rv <dig>  a probable lppo conserved lipoprotein, visualized using the artemis tool and the sanger genomic database  <cit> . the genomic region containing lppo, marked with a square, has no defined gene annotation according to the tigr database . below the artemis visualization, the sequence of the protein is represented, and the sequences of the identified peptides  are shown underlined.

discussion
in prokaryotes, due to its simpler gene structure , orf determination using a combination of bioinformatic tools such as coding potential and homology to other confirmed genes from other organisms, is a relatively efficient task, which is achieved through automated and, in lower scale, manual curation . however, high-throughput genomic sequencing, and consequently automatically generated orf determination, results in the identification of genes or gene families which are purely hypothetical. therefore, the determination of the correct coding sequence regions, and its validation, are still challenging tasks. this is illustrated, for example, with the existent difficulty to predict the translational starting site of the predicted orf. our results show that, even with the constant advances in the in silico analysis of genomes and in the annotation of orfs, there are still difficulties to establish reliable determination of coding sequence regions. proteomic approaches are a powerful method to validate such annotations. using two dimensional electrophoresis, jungblut et al.  <cit> , demonstrated this through the identification of protein products from genes which were not reported on the first gene annotation of m. tuberculosis h37rv performed at the sanger institute  <cit> .

it is important to note that differences in annotations as observed for sanger and tigr are expected, due to differences in the methodology used for predicting and validating coding sequences  <cit> . in addition, since primary annotations have been available for a longer time and tested more extensively , they are probably more refined, as is the case for the sanger m. tuberculosis h37rv dataset. however, an extensive generation of protein databases through different prediction methods, without the concern to integrate them, can result in less efficient proteomic characterization on further studies. it is then relevant to be able to validate, through peptide identification, which gene is appropriately annotated, in order to provide more concise and unbiased databases.

it is striking that the tigr dataset, even though it includes a higher number of predicted genes, still failed to annotate  <dig> proteins . similar results were already observed when unpredicted protein products of lipoproteins from methylococcus capsulatus were identified  <cit> . while our results give a straightforward indication that the annotation criteria produced by the group at the sanger institute is more reliable than the tigr, we do not exclude the possibility that this observation may be due to the fact that we performed our validation on a sample that represents only a small portion of the m. tuberculosis proteome. for example, we were able to identify slight differences as observed for esat- <dig> , one of the main components of m. tuberculosis exported proteins  <cit>  and only  <dig> amino acids longer in the sanger database, but failed to detect several other proteins with more remarkable differences. however, it is still important to point out that further annotation comparisons using tigr datasets and other primary annotations could be performed in order to establish more reliable datasets. the comprehensive microbial resource has, at the moment,  <dig> total genomes mostly sequenced by other institutes/consortiums. in some cases, differences in annotations can have variations as extreme as that observed for the organism mycobacterium leprae, with a primary annotation of  <dig> genes  <cit> , but with a tigr annotation of  <dig> protein coding genes.

another important advantage of comparing databases through such an approach is to determine the translational start site  of the annotated gene. this is relevant not only to define the amino acid sequence of the protein  but, most importantly, to define the upstream region of the orf itself. genome-wide and focused studies of promoter structure and other regulatory motifs depend on the correct definition of the intergenic regions defined by the coding sequence annotations  <cit> . therefore, a correct tss assignment directly affects the analysis of both protein function and transcriptional regulation. for m. tuberculosis, it was shown through a proteomic approach  <cit>  that the protein rv1099c had an incorrect tss, and that reassignment completely altered the predicted promoter region for the gene. while in our study we can not ensure that the specific peptides are indeed the n-terminal of the protein, our results are still valid in order to eliminate the incorrect tss annotated in one or the other dataset.

furthermore, differences in tss choices of the annotated gene will also influence subsequent in silico analysis, like n-terminal predictions used in this article. for example, we observed two cases  where the cleavage site for signal peptidase i was correctly assigned only in the tigr dataset, even though the region containing it is correctly annotated on both datasets. however, both entries are shorter in the tigr database , meaning that the predicted cutting site is closer to the tss choice of tigr than it is in the sanger entry, resulting in higher score results for its correct prediction.

therefore, it is desirable to create more concise databases with as little redundancy as possible. differences in annotations from different institutes or consortiums can be assimilated as a single file, allowing a more precise analysis through proteomic approaches. a perfect example of this was demonstrated by  <cit>  and their ms-friendly database, where they not only created modified entries to confirm n-terminal predictions, but also to validate csnp variations and sequence disagreement between different databases. while in most of their cases the difference resides in only one amino acid from case to case, the same method could be easily used to create concise databases for m. tuberculosis or even for other bacteria. figure  <dig> shows an example of how such a database could be built. in this case, the longer entry  would be kept as the "original" entry in the new database. the shorter tigr version, with an n-terminal part that could not be identified as a tryptic peptide in the sanger version is inserted at the end of the "original" entry separated by a neutral code letter. additional n-terminal or tss predictions from both sanger and tigr could also be inserted in the final file. such an approach would probably increase identification efficiency considerably in following proteomic studies.

CONCLUSIONS
by using a combination of high-accuracy mass spectrometry data acquisition, n-terminal prediction and gene annotation comparison, we were able to identify  <dig> tryptic peptides which were specific to one or other of the two most used databases of the m. tuberculosis h37rv laboratory strain. our data indicates that even on a less complex sample isolated from culture filtrate , such differences in gene annotation may be a limitation to proteomic identifications, since specific proteins for one of the databases were also detected. we propose that a more concise and efficient database generation, including divergent annotation, should be achieved to improve ms-based identifications as recently demonstrated with human csnp validation.
