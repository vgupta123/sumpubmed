BACKGROUND
phospholipase a <dig>  forms a diverse class of enzymes with regard to structure, function, localization and regulation. the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn- <dig> fatty-acyl bond of phospholipids to liberate free fatty acids and lysophospholipids  <cit> . major groups of phospholipase a <dig> that have been actively studied in mammalian systems include a) cytosolic ca2+-dependent  or ca2+-independent   <cit>  and b) ca2+-dependent secretory  phospholipase a <dig>  both the cpla <dig> and ipla <dig> are high molecular weight  intracellular enzymes  <cit>  and they have been widely associated with multifaceted network of signaling pathways. however, pla <dig> that acts on membrane phospholipids has been implicated in cell death and differentiation as well as intracellular membrane trafficking  <cit> .

in mammalian cells, pla <dig> activity has been found to increase in response to numerous stimuli such as osmotic challenge, oxidative stress, ischemic conditions and exposure to allergens. the synthesis of different cell specific sub-types and activation of mammalian pla <dig> are associated with cell injury and various pathophysiological conditions  <cit> . in the central nervous system , pla <dig> is known to participate in many physiological activities  <cit>  and has been found to increase significantly following spinal cord injury  <cit> . the role of pla <dig> has also been documented in schizophrenia, brain trauma and alzheimer's disease  <cit>  besides global and focal ischemia in animal models  <cit> . hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation  have been found to show an increase in pla <dig> activity and a concomitant death of neuronal cells. inhibition of cpla <dig> has been found to result in an enhanced survival of the hippocampal neurons  <cit> . evidently, cpla <dig> knock-out mice subjected to focal cerebral ischemia showed significant reduction in infarct volume and the extent of neurological impairment  <cit> . furthermore, strokin et al  <cit>  demonstrated that inhibition of ipla <dig> during ogd could render neuroprotection to the hippocampal slice cultures. furthermore, simultaneous inhibition of cpla <dig> and spla <dig> activities have also been shown to improve survival of glial cells subjected to ischemic injury  <cit> .

the snake venom pla <dig> belongs to the ca2+-dependant secretory pla <dig>  venom phospholipases a <dig> possess an enzymic activity and a wide variety of pharmacological activities such as antiplatelet, anticoagulant, hemolytic, neurotoxic , myotoxic, edema-inducing, hemorrhagic, cytolytic, cardiotoxic as well as an ability to bind antagonistically to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor   <cit> . the snake venom phospholipases are divided into two main groups, group i and group ii, based on their primary structures  <cit> . the group i pla <dig> is found in abundance in the venom of cobras, kraits and sea snakes, while group ii pla <dig> is common in vipers and pit vipers. the cobra venom pla <dig> belongs to group ia that is similar to the pancreatic type group ib protein but without the signature pancreatic loop structure. venom of naja sputatrtix, a malayan spitting cobra, comprises of three isoforms  of group 1a pla <dig>  one of the neutral forms, npla- <dig>  is a highly potent anticoagulant protein that exhibits relatively high enzymic activity  <cit> . this protein has also been shown to possess an ability to bind to all muscarinic receptor subtypes  with a higher affinity to the m <dig> subtype  <cit> .

in this report, in contrast to the reported detrimental effects of mammalian phospholipase a <dig> to the central nervous system, we demonstrate that neutral pla <dig>  from naja sputatrix could reduce neuronal cell death and afford neuroprotection to rat brain subjected to transient focal ischemia. furthermore, ogd induced tissue injury has also been found to be reduced in the presence of npla. real-time quantitative gene expression analysis showed that the pro-survival and anti-apoptotic genes have been upregulated. both caspase  <dig>  and tunel  assays showed that apoptotic cell death can be reduced upon treatment with npla.

methods
purification of npla
phospholipase a <dig>  was purified from naja sputatrix crude venom  using sephadex g- <dig> gel filtration followed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography . the protein fractions were characterized as described by armugam et al  <cit>  and quantitated using the bradford assay .

transient focal cerebral ischemia
male sprague-dawley rats  were obtained from the laboratory animal centre  and maintained on an ad libitum intake of standard laboratory chow and drinking water. all animals were handled according to the guidelines given by the council for international organization of medical sciences  on animal experimentation  and the national university of singapore  guidelines for handling laboratory animals. animals were anaesthesized and left middle cerebral artery occlusion  was performed as described by longa et al  <cit> . the occlusion was confirmed with the real-time measurement of cerebral blood flow  in the territory of the middle cerebral artery  using the laser-doppler flowmetry  and the signals were digitized using a 4-channel powerlab 4sp  and recordings were displayed with chart  <dig> software . reperfusion was initiated by suture withdrawal after  <dig> min. npla  was injected intravenously via the femoral vein at various times of post-occlusion.

recombinant tissue plasminogen activator  was infused intravenously at a concentration of  <dig> μg/g body weight over a period of  <dig> min, starting  <dig> min post-occlusion. mk <dig>  was administered intraperitoneally in  <dig> doses:  <dig>  μg/g body  <dig> min prior to mcao followed by  <dig>  μg/g body weight at  <dig> and  <dig> hr post-occlusion. corresponding controls were treated with sterile saline and all animals were sacrificed after a total of  <dig> hr reperfusion period.

whole brains were rapidly removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. frozen brains were stored at -80°c until use. consequently, there were  <dig> treatment groups:  <cit>  sham-operated ;  <cit>  transient mcao  for  <dig> min and administered with  <dig> μl saline ;  <cit>  transient mcao for  <dig> min and administered with npla intravenously ;  <cit>  transient mcao for  <dig> min and administered with tpa intravenously ;  <cit>  transient mcao for  <dig> min and administered with mk <dig> intraperitoneally .

quantitation of the ischemic infarct volume
whole rat brains were sliced coronally into  <dig> mm slices and incubated in  <dig>   <dig>  5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride  and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. stained brain slices were scanned and the image was analysed using scion image analysis software for measurement of the infarct volume. the infarct size was determined according to engelhorn et al  <cit> . histopathological changes in the brains were evaluated from paraffin embedded brain slices. cell morphology assessment was carried out using the haematoxylin and eosin staining. the degree of apoptotic neuronal cell death was assessed by tunel staining using the apoptag® peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit  according to manufacturer's protocol.

rna isolation and real-time quantitative pcr
total rna was isolated from brain tissues  by a single-step method using trizol® reagent . the rna samples were treated with rnase-free dnase at 37°c for  <dig> min and stored at -80°c until further use. reverse transcription of total rna and real-time pcr studies using sybr-green chemistry  were carried out according to cher et al  <cit> . a dissociation protocol was carried out at the end of each experiment that was performed in triplicates and repeated at least  <dig> times for each case.

organotypic hippocampal slice culture
organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared as described previously  <cit>  with slight modifications. briefly, hippocampii from  <dig> to  <dig> days old sprague dawley rat pups were dissected and sliced to  <dig> μm thickness and placed in ice-cold growth medium . the sliced tissues were placed onto semiporous membranes  and grown for  <dig> to  <dig> days at 37°c with 5% co <dig> enriched atmosphere before subjecting to oxygen and glucose deprivation  studies. propidium iodide  was included in the culture media during the experiments to trace the damage on the tissues.

oxygen-glucose deprivation -mediated ischemic injury
organotypic hippocampal cultures were grown in basal medium  and transferred to six-well plates containing glucose-free medium  saturated with 95% n <dig>  5%co <dig> and placed into an anaerobic chamber at 37°c and 100% humidity for  <dig> mins. npla , was dissolved in distilled water and added to the medium immediately before exposure to ogd. after  <dig> mins, the cultures  were then transferred to a fresh  <dig> well plate containing pre-warmed serum free medium with  <dig> μg/ml propidium iodide  <cit>  and incubated in the co <dig> chamber for  <dig> hours. the hippocampal slices were viewed under confocal microscope and analysis of damaged ca <dig> hippocampal neurons following ogd was carried out using imagepro plus software . hippocampal culture in serum free media was used as controls in all experiments.

astrocytoma  cell culture
the human astrocytoma cells  were cultured in rpmi  <dig> media  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum , 1% l-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin  and maintained in a 37°c incubator with 5% co <dig>  cells were checked regularly under the light microscope and were divided into appropriate culture plates when they reached 70-80% confluence. cells were subcultured at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells  or  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells  as required and subjected to either staurosporine or ogd treatment.

detection of tnf-α, cytotoxicity assay and caspase assay
detection of tnf-α  in the blood serum of rats subjected to mcao  was carried out using the chemikine™ rat tnfα sandwich elisa kit  according to manufacturer's protocol. blood samples from sprague dawley rats  with and without mcao were administered intravenously with saline  or npla  or intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide . lps was used as a positive control to induce inflammation and for the release of tnf-α.

in organotypic hippocampal slice culture studies, cell death measurement was carried out using the lactate dehydrogenase  assay . briefly, the ldh activity in the culture media was measured spectrophotometrically at  <dig> nm using a multi-plate scanning spectrophotometer  at an end point of  <dig> min. caspase-3-like protease activity was measured by fluorometric assay . devd-afc was used as substrate for caspase activity of the cell lysate and the cleaved afc  was measured in a spectrofluorometer at 400/ <dig> nm .

microarray analysis
total rna isolated from sham, mcao and mcao+npla brains was pooled to minimize inter-individual variation and hybridized to each array of the rae-230a or u34a genechip™ according to protocols described in the genechip™ expression analysis package . each chip represented ~ <dig>  genes and ests and data for each treatment were scaled to an average intensity of  <dig>  probe sets designated 'absent' in all treatments by the analysis software were discarded and only genes whose expressions were changed by  <dig> -fold or greater in each pairwise comparison  were deemed significant. differentially expressed genes  were classified according to their biological functions as described in the netaffx analysis center  and pubmed  databases. the data discussed in this publication have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus  <cit>  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig>  .

statistical analysis
all statistical analysis was carried out using single-factor anova followed by  dunnett multiple comparison tests for mcao brain slice analysis and  for all other in vitro experiments, pairwise comparisons were carried out using unpaired student's t-test.

RESULTS
npla reduces infarct volume in mcao rat model
the npla native protein, was purified from naja sputatrix according to the methods described by armugam et al  <cit> . the purity and identity of this protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry and n-terminal sequencing before using in this study. naja sputatrix venom contains three  isoforms of pla <dig>  their molecular mass is approximately  <dig> kda and all of them have anticoagulant and phospholipase activity  <cit> . among them, the npla is a most potent anticoagulant, with an enzymic activity and also competes with atropine for the muscarinic receptor  <cit> .

the anti-ischemic and neuroprotective property of the npla was initially observed in vivo, in rat model subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion . npla was administered intravenously, at doses of  <dig>  μg/g,  <dig>  μg/g,  <dig>  μg/g, body weight  immediately  <dig> min,  <dig> min and  <dig> min after mcao. however, the highest neuroprotective effect  has only been observed at the  <dig>  μg/g rats and therefore all experiments were conducted at this concentration of npla <dig> . the administration of npla immediately upon occlusion  resulted in a significant reduction  in infarct size, as observed by triphenyltetrazolium chloride  staining of serial brain sections . ischemic damage was markedly attenuated in the striatum and cortex of the brain, with more pronounced protection in striatal tissue. administration of npla at  <dig> min post-mcao also reduced the infarct size but to lesser extent . no protection was observed at  <dig> min or later. the abilities of tpa and a non-competitive antagonist of the nmda receptor, dizocilpine  to reduce infarct volume was used as controls and were compared to that of npla. intravenous infusion of  <dig> μg/g body weight tpa did not significantly reduce infarct volume after transient ischemia . the inability of tpa to prevent neuronal death is perhaps not surprising since its efficacy has mainly been demonstrated in embolic stroke models  <cit>  or after mild transient focal ischemia  <cit> . on the other hand, the intra-peritonial administration of mk <dig> in three doses , at  <dig>  μg/g body weight about  <dig> min prior to mcao and followed by  <dig>  μg/g body weight at 6- and  <dig> hr post-occlusion  <cit>  significantly reduced infarct volume to  <dig> % ±  <dig> % as compared to the vehicle control . the extent of neuroprotection conferred by mk <dig> is however lower than that observed for npla  administered immediately post-occlusion. nevertheless, the mk <dig> conferred neuroprotection was significantly higher than that conferred by npla given after  <dig> min of mcao . it should be noted that mk <dig> was administered at  <dig> time points  while the npla was administered only once at  <dig>  μg/g. thus the efficacy of npla mediated protection can be considered to be more pronounced than that of the positive control, mk <dig>  tnf-α has been demonstrated to be elevated upon mcao and this increase in tnf-α activity results in increase of the endogenous spla <dig> expression/activity that is implicated in neuronal damage in ischemic models  <cit> . intraperitoneal administration of bacterial lps  dramatically increased plasma tnf-α levels  as compared to the saline-treated control . in contrast, npla <dig> failed to induce significant tnf-α release or expression in both normal and ischemic rats . thus, the  <dig>  ld <dig> npla  does not induce inflammation or cytotoxicity as previously observed by tan and armugam  <cit> .

reduction in apoptotic cell death upon npla treatment
the paraffin-embedded rat brain  sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and cellular morphology was evaluated using light microscopy. extensive tissue damage and edema were observed in the striatum and cortex of mcao brain slices . neurons appeared shrunken and nuclei were dysmorphic and pyknotic, consistent with apoptotic cell death  <cit> . tunel assay was carried out to assess the extent of apoptosis in ischemic brains . control cells appeared green whereas almost all the neurons in the striatum and cortex of ischemic brains  exhibited apoptosis and their nuclei were stained brown. the degree of apoptosis was greatly reduced by the administration of npla immediately post-occlusion as evidenced by the substantial reduction in number of apoptotic cells. furthermore, real-time pcr analysis on selected genes encoding apoptosis related proteins  and the survival pathway mediating proteins  as well as the signalling pathway proteins , and ion and water channel proteins , showed  that the npla treatment reduces the effects of mcao-mediated neuronal/cell damage via promoting cell survival/protective mechanisms. similarly, we have also observed that staurosporine -mediated cell death in human astrocytoma cells  could be alleviated by  <dig>  μm npla . the reduction in cell death has also been found to be accompanied by a decrease in caspase- <dig> activity . furthermore, inclusion of  <dig>  μm npla in the basal media during ogd, protected the astrocytoma cells from cell death. improved cell viability has always been accompanied by a significant reduction in caspase- <dig> activity .

npla-mediated neuroprotection in in vitro studies
npla-mediated neuroprotection was also observed in the organotypic hippocampal culture subjected to ogd . almost complete  protection was seen at  <dig>  μm npla, which is similar to the protection induced by positive control, mk <dig> . ldh assay showed that npla could reduce the cytotoxicity induced by ogd. the bcl- <dig>  and bcl-xl  genes were upregulated whereas bax  was found to be downregulated in the organotypic hippocampal slice culture in ogd conditions at both  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm npla respectively . similarly, concurrent  and post-treatment with npla showed reduced neuronal injury in a dose-dependent manner in hippocampal slice culture  subjected to glutamate induced excitotoxicity .

global gene expression analysis
global gene expression analysis by oligonucleotide microarray in mcao and mcao+npla showed a total of  <dig> genes .

among these, the endogenous phospholipases  have been found to be upregulated upon treatment of the the mcao rats with npla . the expression of cpla <dig> , reported to contribute to the pathophysiological conditions and neurological deficits during stroke, has also been found to be significantly higher in the npla treated rats. on the other hand, the ipla <dig> , has been found to be downregulated in both the control and npla treated mcao rats. it is noteworthy that the plcs  that are involved in ca2+ dependent signal transduction activities remained highly upregulated in the npla treated animals. however, following a prolonged  reperfusion the expression of all the endogenous phospholipases except pla2-1b, pla2-2a and pla2-2c reached a basal level comparable to that of the control. npla treatment showed an upregulation of pla2-1b, -2a and -2c and a downregulation of endogenous ipla <dig> 

the microarray dataset when clustered by k-means clustering using the genesis software package  <cit>  gave  <dig> clusters of which clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  represented the genes that were fully restored to sham levels following npla treatment .

the genes in cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig>  during mcao revert to normal  level of expression upon npla treatment. the gene ontology classes can also be seen to be quite similar in both clusters  <dig> &  <dig>  the major sites  of action of npla appear to be the membrane and nucleus, implicating involvement of receptors and signaling pathways. this is further observed in pathway analysis using gene ontology  and genmapp program  <cit>  where most of the pathways involved are signalling pathways. cluster  <dig> contains genes that are localized in the ribosome as well.

nucleotide binding  is the most common functional go class found for both clusters. interestingly there are several ion binding related go classes such as calcium and zinc ion binding that are common to both clusters, implicating the involvement of npla in the regulation of ionic levels of the cells. g-protein coupled receptor  protein signalling pathway and intracellular protein transport are among the several common processes that were observed in both the clusters  <dig> &  <dig> 

the pathways involved in apoptosis   <dig>  tnf-alpha-nf-kb and mapk signalling pathways) and inflammation , were observed to be highly affected by npla treatment in mcao rats. nfκb <dig> which is upregulated in npla treatment directly inhibits apoptosis . egfr <dig> pathway regulates apoptosis and many genes of this pathway can be seen in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> . hspa1a also known as hsp <dig> that inhibits apoptosis was found to be further upregulated upon npla treatment than mcao . nfkb <dig> which is upregulated only in npla treatment is known to enhance cell survival. thus, npla treatment appeared to protect the cell by anti-apoptotic as well as cell survival mechanisms.

discussion
npla reduces infarct volume and protects neurons from cell death
in this report, we demonstrate that npla could reduce apoptotic cell death and render neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia. intravenous administration of npla to the mcao rats at  <dig> min and  <dig> min post-occlusion reduced infarct volumes to  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively as compared to the vehicle control. saluja et al  <cit>  observed significant increase in cpla <dig> activity and expression after  <dig> mins and  <dig> mins upon onset of global ischemia. furthermore, in an in vitro study, cpla <dig> activity was not detected in the absence of calcium ion  <cit> . thus, these reports could explain our observation that administration of npla at only  <dig> min  and  <dig> mins and not after  <dig> mins of occlusion, showed neuroprotection in our rat mcao model. significant reduction in ischemic damage has also been observed in histological analysis of the brain slices, where many cell nuclei exhibited normal morphology in npla treated mcao rat brain. neurons within the ischemic core die largely by means of a necrotic mechanism as a result of the excitotoxicity cascade triggered by energy depletion while damage within the penumbra is mediated by mechanisms such as apoptosis. during cerebral ischemia, sub-lethal injury to neurons favours the initiation of apoptosis in the penumbral neurons  <cit> . the npla-mediated protection has been found to target the area/region where cells are undergoing apoptosis and consequently reducing cell death as observed in the tunel assay. daniel and decoster  <cit>  have demonstrated that tunel staining could be used as apoptosis marker and is significant at later times  of cell death. hence, npla appears to possess the ability to protect, possibly the penumbra region from ischemic damage. furthermore, npla-mediated 'protection' was also observed in human astrocytoma cells  exposed to staurosporine  where increased cell viability and reduction in caspase  <dig> activity was observed upon npla treatment . furthermore, significant reduction in fitc-annexin v stained cells were observed in the astrocytoma exposed to sts and treated with  <dig>  μm npla. hoechst <dig> staining showed that lesser number of dna fragmentation occurs in the presence of npla. thus indicating that npla could be mediating cell protection by reducing the apoptotic cell death.

hippocampal slice cultures subjected to ogd also showed that  <dig>  μm npla promoted about 60% and 95% survival at the ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions respectively, whereas  <dig>  μm npla showed 95% protection for both regions. the protection mediated by npla  was similar to that observed for mk <dig>  a selective non-competitive antagonist of nmda receptor. mk <dig> was used as a positive control for neuroprotection as it has been shown to be highly neuroprotective in both models of ischemia and hypoxia  <cit> . we have also observed that the protection shown in the presence of npla is solely mediated by npla and not by intracellular pla <dig> . this is also because  similar protection could not be observed in the vehicle treated control slices subjected to ogd and  the endogenous pla2s are known to mediate cell death rather than protection in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures subjected to ogd  <cit> .

gilroy et al  <cit>  have also demonstrated that ipla <dig> is highly expressed at the onset phase of an acute inflammation with comparatively lower levels of spla <dig>  as well as cpla <dig>  while the spla <dig> and cpla <dig> were the predominant isoforms expressed during lesion resolution. inhibition of both the cpla and ipla has been proposed to be beneficial in reducing infarct volume and increasing the neurological activities of mice subjected to mcao  <cit>  as well as increasing survival and neuroprotection in in vitro experiments  <cit> . the global gene expression data show that npla administration during mcao reduces the ipla <dig> but increases the cpla <dig> and spla <dig> expression . in contrast to the general observation that endogenous pla <dig> promotes pathophysiological condition, forlenza et al  <cit>  reported that reduced endogenous pla <dig>  activity could impair neuronal viability and the functional integrity of both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent cytosolic pla <dig>  endogenous spla2-x and human spla2-iii have been reported to promote neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells  <cit> , an effect that is not observed with the administration of spla-1b or spla-iia. it is noteworthy that the npla belongs to the group 1a  which is similar to the spla-1b but without the signature pancreatic loop.

we have also shown that npla could protect cell death induced by glutamate  in the hippocampal slice culture as well as in the astrocytoma cell culture . furthermore, in a separate in vitro study on astrocytes and hippocampii using glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists as well as an inhibitor to phospholipase activity , we have found that the npla mediated neuroprotection is exerted via the mglur, specifically mglur <dig> and not by its phospholipase activity .

quantitative gene expression analysis on the mcao  ipsilateral brain  and hippocampal tissues subjected to ogd   showed that the pro-survival  and anti-apoptotic  genes were up-regulated while the pro-apoptotic bax gene was down-regulated upon npla administration in both the in vivo and in vitro studies. bax homodimer has been reported to activate apoptosis while the heterodimer  is known to inhibit the process  <cit> . elevated intracellular ratio of bax to bcl- <dig> occurs during increased apoptotic cell death  <cit> . similarly, over-expression of bcl- <dig> in in vivo ischemic studies resulted in reduced apoptotic cell death  <cit> . hence, the quantitative real-time pcr results on the brain sample subjected to mcao and hippocampal slice culture subjected to ogd, further support that apoptotic cell death is reduced upon treatment with npla. the high expression of both anti-apoptotic genes , could possibly result in bax/bcl- <dig> or bcl-xl heterodimerization, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and promoting neuroprotection. similarly, neuroprotectin d <dig>  derivative of docosahexaenoic acid , that promotes strong neuroprotection and neurotrophic activity following ischemia and reperfusion, also up-regulates bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl. neuroprotectin d <dig> was also observed to inhibit the caspase- <dig> activation  <cit> . however, npla improved cell viability and survival in astrocytoma cells subjected to ogd. the increase in cell viability was accompanied by significant reduction in caspase- <dig> activity.

consistently, reduction in caspase activity and increased in cell viability have also been observed in staurosporine-mediated apoptosis in astrocytoma cells treated with npla . oligonucleotide/dna microarray analysis also suggests that npla treatment in mcao rats reduce the impact of mcao-mediated cellular damage to normal  level via inhibiting or reducing the effect of apoptosis and inflammatory mechanisms, thus supporting an anti-apoptotic regulation as a possible mechanism of action for npla-mediated neuroprotection, which is also consistent with our tunnel assays and real-time pcr analysis.

regulation of water and ion channel genes
apoptotic volume decrease , the earliest morphological event of apoptosis that is depicted by pronounced cell shrinkage is believed to involve regulation of water and ion channels. during avd, intracellular ion concentrations are altered following inhibition of na+/k+atpase in conjunction with a transient na+ accumulation followed by the extrusion of both na+ and k+ ions from the cell. decreased intracellular k+ is in turn required for the activation of the apoptotic/caspase cascade and optimal nuclease activity  <cit> . water movement during the avd is mediated primarily via aquaporins and that plasma membrane water permeability directly affects the rate of apoptotic progression  <cit> . aquaporins have been shown to play a pivotal role in the formation and clearance of fluid  during cerebral ischemia. the aqp <dig> is a water specific mercury insensitive water channel that is found abundantly in brain and the aqp <dig> is an aquaglyceroporin that conducts urea, lactate, arsenite, purine and pyrimidines, besides water molecule  <cit> . aquaporin  <dig> and  <dig> have been shown to be down-regulated in experimental ischemic rat brain, while the aqp <dig> knockout mice subjected to mcao showed smaller infarct volume. the regression of ischemic infract also required an up-regulation of aqps  <cit> . interestingly, in our study, both these aquaporins  were up-regulated upon npla administration. up-regulation of aqp <dig> therefore suggests that the lactate and other solutes that were formed during the ischemic injury may be channelled out of the cell via aqp <dig>  thus could prove beneficial in neuroprotection. notably, the kir <dig>  and na+/k+atpase genes were also upregulated upon npla administration in the mcao rat. similarly, we have also observed that expression of the aquaporin genes as well as the kir <dig>  and na+/k+atpase in astrocytoma cells subjected to ogd  were reversed in the presence of npla. expression of genes involved in cell survival promoting pathway  have also been significantly upregulated with npla administration, indicating that an anti-apoptotic, homeostatic  and cell survival regulation are being triggered in npla-mediated neuroprotection.

CONCLUSIONS
snake venom pla <dig> is known for its pathopharmacological activities. we have shown here that npla, a potent toxin isolated from naja sputatrix venom, could reduce neuronal cell death and promote cell survival both under in vivo and in vitro ischemic conditions. its beneficial effects could be seen at a sublethal in vivo dose of  <dig>  μg/g rats  and at a concentration of  <dig>  μm under in vitro conditions.
