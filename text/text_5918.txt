BACKGROUND
allergic contact dermatitis  is a common inflammatory skin disease characterized by eczema and recurrent episodes of itching  <cit> . the disease affects a significant proportion of the population, with prevalence rates of  <dig> % to  <dig> % in europe  <cit> , and the incidence is increasing due to repeated exposure to sensitizing chemicals. acd is a type iv delayed-type hypersensitivity response caused mainly by reactive t helper  <dig>  and interferon γ producing cd8+ t cells, at site of contact with small chemical haptens in previously exposed, and immunologically sensitized, individuals  <cit> . dendritic cells  in the epidermis initiate the immune reactions by responding to haptens bound to self-molecules subsequently activating t cell-mediated immunity.

the reach  regulation requires that all new and existing chemicals within the european union, involving approximately  <dig>  chemicals, should be tested for hazardous effects  <cit> . as the identification of potential sensitizers currently requires animal testing, the reach legislation will have a huge impact on the number of animals needed for testing. further, the 7th amendment to the cosmetics directive posed a ban on animal tests for the majority of cosmetic ingredients for human use, to be in effect by  <dig>  with the exceptions of some tests by  <dig>  thus, development of reliable in vitro alternatives to experimental animals for the assessment of sensitizing capacity of chemicals is urgent. to date, no non-animal replacements are available for identification of skin sensitizing chemicals, instead the preferred assay is the mouse local lymph node assay   <cit> , followed by the guinea pig maximization test   <cit> . an in vitro alternative to these animal models should exhibit improved reliability, accuracy and importantly correlate to human reactivity.

dcs play key roles in the immune response by bridging the essential connections between innate and adaptive immunity. upon stimulation, they can rapidly produce large amounts of mediators that affect chemotaxis and activation of other cells at the site of inflammation, and can selectively respond to various pathogens and environmental factors, by fine-tuning the cellular response through antigen-presentation. thus, exploring and utilizing the immunological decision-making by dcs during stimulation with sensitizers, could serve as a potent test strategy for the prediction of sensitization.

factors that complicate and impede the use of primary dcs as a test platform include adaptable phenotypes and specialized functions of different dc subpopulations, in addition to their wide and sparse distribution. thus, the development of assays based on the predictability of dc function must rely on alternative cell types or mimics of in vivo dcs. for this purpose, a cell line with dc characteristics would be advantageous, as it constitutes a stable, reproducible and unlimited supply of cells. mutz- <dig> is an unlimited source of cd34+ dc progenitors. upon differentiation, mutz- <dig> can acquire phenotypes comparable to immature dcs or langerhans-like dcs  <cit> , present antigens through cd1d, mhc class i and ii and induce specific t-cell proliferation  <cit> . differentiated mutz- <dig> can also display a mature transcriptional and phenotypic profile upon stimulation with inflammatory cytokines  <cit> .

in this report, we present a novel test principle for the prediction of skin sensitizers. to simplify the assay procedures and increase reproducibility, we employed progenitor mutz- <dig> cells, without further differentiation, and subjected the cells to stimulation with a large panel of sensitizing chemicals, non-sensitizing chemicals, and controls. the transcriptional response to chemical stimulation was assessed by genome-wide profiling. from data analysis, a biomarker signature of  <dig> transcripts was identified, which completely separated the response induced by sensitizing chemicals vs. non-sensitizing chemicals and the predictive power of the signature was illustrated, using roc curves. the biomarker signature includes transcripts involved in relevant biological pathways, such as oxidative stress, dc maturation and cytokine responses, which further could shed light on molecular interactions involved in the process of sensitization. in conclusion, we have identified a biomarker signature with potent predictive power, which we propose as an in vitro assay for the identification of human sensitizing chemicals.

RESULTS
the cellular rationale of the in vitro cell culture system
dcs are essential immunoregulatory cells of the immune system demonstrated by their unique property to recognize antigen for the initiating of t cell responses, and their potent regulatory function in skewing immune responses. this makes them obvious targets for assay development. however, primary dcs constitute a heterogeneous and minor population of cells not suited for screening and the choice would be a human dc-like cell line, with characteristics compared to primary dcs. since no leukemic cell line with dc-like properties has been reported  <cit> , the generation of human dc-like cell lines relies on available myeloid leukemia cell lines. mutz- <dig> is a human acute myelomonocytic leukemia cell line with a potent ability to mimic primary human dcs  <cit> . similar to immature primary dcs, mutz- <dig> progenitors express cd1a, hla-dr and cd <dig>  as well as low levels of cd <dig> and cd <dig> . the mutz- <dig> population also contains three subpopulations of cd14+, cd34+ and double negative cells, previously reported to be transitional differentiation steps from a proliferative cd34+ progenitor into a non-proliferative cd14+ dc precursor  <cit> . consequently, constitutively differentiating progenitor mutz- <dig> cells were used as the basis for a test system.

cd <dig> surface expression in response to sensitizer stimulation
cd <dig> is the most extensively studied biomarker for sensitization to date, using e.g. monocyte derived dendritic cells  or human cell lines and their progenitors, such as thp- <dig>  u- <dig> and kg- <dig>  thus, as a reference, cell surface expression of cd <dig> was measured with flow cytometry after  <dig> h stimulation, using  <dig> sensitizers and  <dig> non-sensitizers, as well as vehicle controls . cd <dig> was significantly up-regulated on cells stimulated with 2-aminophenol, kathon cg, 2-nitro- <dig> -phenylendiamine,  <dig> -dinitrochlorobenzene, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, cinnamic aldehyde, p-phenylendiamine, resorcinol, potassium dichromate, and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole. hence, an assay based on measurement of a single biomarker, such as cd <dig>  would give a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 100%. consequently, cd <dig> cannot classify skin sensitizers, using a system based on mutz- <dig> cells.

analysis of the transcriptional profiles in chemically stimulated mutz- <dig> cells
the genomic expression arrays were then used to test the same  <dig> sensitizers and  <dig> non-sensitizers, in triplicates. the vehicle controls, such as dmso and distilled water, were included in twelve replicates. in total, a data set was generated based on  <dig> samples. rma normalization and quality controls of the samples revealed that the oxazolone and cinnamic aldehyde samples were significant outliers and had to be removed, or they would have dominated the data set prohibiting biomarker identification . in addition, one of the replicates of potassium permanganate had to be removed due to a faulty array. this left a data set consisting of  <dig> samples, each with data from measurements of  <dig>  transcripts. in order to mine the data set for information specific for sensitizers vs. non-sensitizers, the software qlucore omics explorer  <dig>  was used, which enable real time principal component analysis  analysis. the input genes were at the same time sorted after desired criteria, i.e. sensitizers and non-sensitizers, based on anova p-value selection. two different anova analyses were performed . first, figure 3a and 3b show pca plots based on  <dig> transcripts with a p-value of ≤  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  from a one-way anova analysis, comparing sensitizing vs. non-sensitizing chemicals. as can be seen in figure 3a, a clear discrimination can be made between the two groups, with non-sensitizers forming a condensed cloud in the lower part of the figure , while sensitizers stretch upwards in various directions . however, a complete separation is not achieved between the two groups at this level of significance. from figure 3b, now colored according to stimulating agent, it is evident that one or more replicate of glyoxal, eugenol, hexylcinnamic aldehyde, isoeugenol, resorcinol, penicillin g and ethylendiamine grouped together with the control group. in addition, one replicate or more of the non-sensitizers tween  <dig>  octanoic acid and phenol grouped closely with the sensitizers. secondly, figure 3c and 3d show pca plots based on  <dig> genes, with p-values ≤  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  from a multi-group anova analysis, comparing each individual stimulation. identifying this large number of genes at this level of significance provided strong indications of the power in the data set. in figure 3d, it is clear that the replicates group together, indicating high quality data. the triplicate samples of potassium dichromate have a discrete profile, which demonstrate a substantial impact of the cells compared to non-sensitizers. furthermore, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2-aminophenol, kathon cg, formaldehyde, 2-nitro- <dig> -phenylendiamine,  <dig> -dinitrochlorobenzoic acid, p-phenylendiamine, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, cinnamic alcohol and resorcinol have replicates that group together, separate from the negative group. still, as can be seen in figure 3c as well as in 3a, complete separation is not achieved with neither of the gene signatures of  <dig> and  <dig> genes both selected on p-values.

backward elimination identifies genes with the most discriminatory power
even though the data set contains genes with p-values down to  <dig> × 10- <dig>  lowering the p-value cutoff did not achieve complete separation between sensitizers and non-sensitizers. gene signatures entirely selected on p-values does not provide the best possible predictive power, since the information is per se not orthogonal. to further reduce the number of transcripts for a predictive biomarker signature, we employed an algorithm for backward elimination . the algorithm removes genes one by one while taking into account not only the impact of genes individually, but how they perform collectively with the entire selected gene signature. for each gene eliminated, the kullback-leibler divergence  value is lowered, until a breakpoint is reached, at which point  <dig> genes remained. continuing eliminating genes at this point causes the kld to rise again, indicating that information is being lost . therefore, the  <dig> genes with lowest kld value were selected for further analysis. pca of the  <dig> analytes now revealed that they have the ability to completely separate sensitizers from non-sensitizers, indicating that these transcripts can be used as predictors for sensitizing properties of unknown samples . importantly, by coloring the samples in the pca by their potency, according to llna, it is clear that potency can also be predicted , as extreme and strong sensitizers tend to group further from the non-sensitizers, while moderate and extreme sensitizers group closer to non-sensitizers. the  <dig> genes are termed the "prediction signature" and their identities are listed in table  <dig>  in addition, the transcriptional profiles of the differentially expressed genes are presented in a heatmap .

the table shows the biomarker genes found by t-test and backward elimination. genes were annotated, using the netaffx database from affymetrix . when found, the entrez gene id http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene was chosen as the gene identifier. the validation call frequency  is the occurrence of each gene in the  <dig> test gene signatures obtained in the validation step.

interrogation of the analysis used to identify the prediction signature
to validate the predictive power of our signature, we used a machine learning method called the support vector machine   <cit> , which maps the data from a training set in space in order to maximize the separation of gene expression induced by sensitizing and non-sensitizing chemicals. as training set, 70% of the data set was selected randomly and the entire selection process was repeated. starting with  <dig>  transcripts, the signature was reduced to  <dig> transcripts, termed "test gene signature", using anova filtering and backward elimination, as described above. the remaining 30% of the data set was used to test each signature. the partitioning of the data set into subsets of 70% training data set and 30% test data set was done in a stratified random manner, while maintaining the relation of sensitizers and non-sensitizers. thereafter, the test gene signature was used to train an svm model with the training set, and the predictive power of the model was assessed with the test set. this entire process was iterated  <dig> times. the frequency by which each gene in the prediction signature was included in the test gene signatures is reported in table  <dig>  figure 6a shows a pca plot based on the test gene signature from one representative iteration. clearly, the separation between sensitizers and non-sensitizers resembles the one observed for the prediction signature in figure 4b. in figure 6a, the samples of the sensitizing and non-sensitizing chemicals in the test set have been colored dark red and dark green respectively, indicating that they are not contributing to the principal components of the plot, but are merely plotted based on their expression values of the selected test gene signature. as can be seen, sensitizers from the test set group with sensitizers from the training set, while non-sensitizers from the test set group with non-sensitizers from the training set. the final outcome of the svm training and validation can be seen in figure 6b, where the areas under the roc curve are plotted for each iteration. the average area under the roc curve of  <dig>  confirms the ability to discriminate sensitizers from control samples. based on this average, the estimated prediction performance of the assay reveals an accuracy of 99%, sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 99%. while this experiment does not validate the prediction power of the prediction signature per se, it does indeed validate the method by which it has been selected, supporting the claim that the prediction signature is capable of accurately predicting sensitizing properties of unknown samples.

interactome, molecular functions and canonical pathways involving the prediction signature
using ingenuity pathways analysis ,  <dig> of the  <dig> molecules in the signature were characterized with regard to the interactome, known functions and  pathways. the remaining  <dig> molecules could not be mapped to any unique ipa entries. the dominating functions identified were small molecule biochemistry , cell death , lipid metabolism , hematological system development , cell cycle , molecular transport , cellular growth and proliferation , and carbohydrate metabolism  .

dominating functions in the molecular signature.  <dig> of the  <dig> molecules were functionally investigated, using ipa. only functions populated by  <dig> or more genes were included in the present study.

pathways possibly invoked by the molecules in the signature were also investigated using ipa. those most highly populated involved nrf2-mediated oxidative response , xenobiotic metabolism signaling , protein ubiquitination pathway , lps/il- <dig> mediated inhibition of rxr function , aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling  and protein kinase a signaling . these pathways are known to take part in reactions provoked by foreign substances, xenobiotics, which supports a relevant biology behind the genomic signature.

discussion
allergic contact dermatitis  is an inflammatory skin disease caused by an adaptive immune response to normally innocuous chemicals  <cit> . small molecular weight chemicals, so-called haptens, can bind self-proteins in the skin, which enables internalization of the protein-bound allergenic chemical by skin dendritic cell . dcs, under the influence of the local microenvironment, process the protein-hapten complex, migrate to the local lymph nodes and activate naïve t cells. the initiation and development of allergen-specific responses, mainly effector cd8+ t cells and th <dig> cells, and production of immunoregulatory proteins, are hallmarks of the immune activation observed in acd. acd is also the most common manifestation of immunotoxicity observed in humans  <cit>  and hundreds of chemicals have been shown to cause sensitization in skin  <cit> . the driving factors and molecular mechanisms involved in sensitization are still unknown even though intense research efforts have been carried out to characterize the immunological responses towards allergenic chemicals. the reach legislation requires that all chemicals produced over  <dig> ton/year are tested for hazardous properties such as toxicity and allergenicity  <cit> , which increase the demand for accurate assays with predictive power for hazard identification. additionally, the 7th amendment to the cosmetics directive  poses a complete ban on using animal experimentation for testing cosmetic ingredients by  <dig> if a scientifically reliable method is available. thus, there is a significant need for predictive test methods that are based on human cells. today, the identification of potential human sensitizers relies on animal experimentation, in particular the murine local lymph node assay   <cit> . the llna is based upon measurements of proliferation induced in draining lymph nodes of mice after chemical exposure  <cit> . chemicals are defined as sensitizers if they provoke a three-fold increase in proliferation compared to control, and the amount of chemical required for the increase is the ec <dig> value. thus, the llna can also be used to categorize the chemicals based on sensitization potency. however, llna is, besides the obvious ethical implications, also time consuming and expensive. human sensitization data often stem from human maximization tests   <cit>  and human patch tests . in an extensive report from the interagency coordinating committee on the validation of alternative methods , the performance characteristics of llna were compared to other available animal-based methods and human sensitization data   <cit> . the llna performance in comparison to human data  revealed an accuracy of 72%, a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 67%.

various human cell lines and primary cells involved in sensitization have been evaluated as predictive test system, such as epithelial cells, dendritic cells and t cells, however, no validated test assay is currently available. thp- <dig>  u <dig>  kg- <dig> and mutz- <dig>  naive or differentiated, are among the human myeloid cell lines most extensively evaluated as platforms for dc-based in vitro assays, as reviewed in  <cit> . these cells are easy to grow and enable standardization of protocols. u <dig> and thp- <dig> are currently being evaluated in pre-validation stage for prediction of skin sensitization. the human cell line activation test  is based upon analysis of cd <dig> and/or cd <dig> expression on thp- <dig> cells after chemical stimulation  <cit> . the myeloid u <dig> skin sensitization test  also involves analysis of cd <dig>  <cit> . these assays are thus very limited in readout. as cd <dig> is among the markers most extensively studied, we evaluated the expression level of this marker in our assay. we demonstrated its relevance but also its insufficient predictive power , since only  <dig> out of  <dig> sensitizing chemicals induced a significant up regulation of cd <dig>  various other single biomarkers have been suggested to be up regulated upon stimulation with sensitizing chemicals, such as cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cxcl <dig>  il-1β, mip-1β, p <dig> mapk, as reviewed in  <cit> , yet single-handedly, none of them have enough predictive power to discriminate between sensitizing and non-sensitizing chemicals. the analysis of biomarker signatures, i.e. combination of biomarkers, has been shown to be superior in molecular diagnostic of cancer and superior to any single biomarker. consequently, we therefore utilized the power of global transcriptomics and screened the gene regulation induced by a large set of well-defined chemicals and controls in search of predictive biomarker combinations.

the large number of differentially expressed genes in mutz- <dig> cells stimulated with sensitizing chemicals vs. non-sensitizing controls revealed that mutz- <dig> indeed had a capacity to differentiate between these two groups. efforts have previously been done to create assays based on genome analysis in various cell systems, such as e.g. cd34+-progenitor cells-derived dcs  <cit> . while such assays might provide in vivo like environments, primary cells are not well suited for a high-throughput format considering both donor-dependent variations as well as ethical aspect of such cell sources. furthermore, previous efforts within in vitro assay development for sensitization that rely on full genome analysis have used a limited set of testing compounds.

the present study utilized in all  <dig> compounds and efforts were made to divide these compounds into two subsets, for training and testing respectively. while these experiments have resulted in successful predictions , it is our experience that sensitizing compounds differ greatly in their induced gene expression profile, as can be seen in figure 3d. in this perspective, we strived to include as many training compounds as possible when identifying our prediction signature, and did not exclude any compounds for validation. instead, we validated the method by which the prediction signature was identified, by subdividing the samples into training and test sets at random, using unseen data for validation, to avoid overfitting. at present, the prediction signature consists of  <dig> transcripts, based on figure 4a. continuing the elimination process beyond  <dig> transcripts causes loss of information, as seen by the rise of kld. experiments have shown that correct classifications are possible even with further reduced signatures, down to  <dig> genes . a reduction of signature size could be assessed in conjunction with validation of the assay, using untested positive and negative compounds in a new test set. by reducing the signature size at this point, the risk of biasing the signature towards this data set increases, making it harder to correctly classify unknown samples. additional test compounds will also serve to assess the frequency of extreme transcriptional profile outliers, such as oxazolone and cinnamic aldehyde, which had to be removed from the analysis performed in this study. a number of reasons may be attributed to the fact that these compounds were not compatible with the assay, such as solubility in the cell media or extreme toxic effects. in those cases, other in vitro alternatives may complement this assay, so that the safety assessment of chemicals for sensitization includes a battery of in vitro assays. naturally, an additional data set with blinded compounds is essential to validate whether the assay truly performs as estimated by the random subdivisions into training and test sets.

of note, our prediction signature is able to predict the potency of sensitizing compounds, as defined by the llna . however, the potency predicted by llna and that of our classifier do not match for all samples. notably, the moderate sensitizer 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate showed resemblance to strong and extreme sensitizers with respect to gene expression profile. similarly, the moderate sensitizers ethylendiamine, hexylcinnamic aldehyde, and glyoxal grouped together with weak sensitizers. these findings support the fact that sensitizing potency, as defined, may need revising.

by studying the identity of the transcripts and their involvement in intracellular signaling pathways, we were also able to confirm the biological relevance of the prediction signature. using ipa, we found that the most highly populated pathways were nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor  <dig>  mediated oxidative response, xenobiotic metabolism signaling, protein ubiquitination pathway, lps/il- <dig> mediated inhibition of retinoic x receptor  function, aryl hydrocarbon receptor  signaling, and protein kinase a  signaling. these pathways are all known to take part in reactions provoked by xenobiotics, and several were associated with oxidative stress. furthermore, toll-like receptor  signaling is among the top pathways found in ipa. recent studies on assay development for prediction of sensitization in vitro have to a large extent focused on how danger signals are provided to antigen-presenting cells, inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as co-stimulatory molecules needed for a specific t-cell response. we hypothesize that these signals are provided through the innate immune responses, in analogy with infections, as reviewed in  <cit> .

the primary pathways found in this study involved nrf <dig> signaling. this is a pathway activated by reactive oxygen species , and is a defense mechanism to xenobiotics and response to cellular stress. in the resting cell, nrf <dig> is bound by kelch-like ech-associated protein  <dig>  and located in the cytosol. in the response to ros activity, keap <dig> is targeted for ubiquitination and protesomal degradation, resulting in the translocation of nrf <dig> to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of genes containing anti-oxidant response elements  in their promoter region  <cit> . the functions of genes transcribed by nrf <dig> association to are include regulation of inflammation, migration of dc and anti-oxidant defense enzymes, such as nadph quinone oxidoreductase  <dig>  and glutathione s-transferases   <cit> , genes found in the prediction signature. furthermore, the nrf2/keap1/are pathway has previously been described as activated in response to skin sensitizers, inducing maturation of dendritic cells  <cit> .

similarly, ahr is a transcription factor in the cytosol that is activated by binding to ligands, which includes a wide range of xenobiotic chemicals, such as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, polyphenols and a number of pharmaceuticals  <cit> . in the absence of a ligand, ahr is bound by a complex of chaperon proteins, keeping it in the cytosol. upon ligand binding, ahr is translocated to the nucleus, where it dimerizes with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator   <cit> . the arnt/ahr heterodimer then binds to xenobiotic response elements  in promoter regions of target genes. the typical target genes for xre include enzymes for drug metabolism, such as the cytochrome p <dig>  superfamily, as well as cytoprotective enzymes mediating defense against oxidative stress, such as nqo <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, while nqo <dig> is under control of both nrf <dig> and ahr, with both are and xre in the promoter region, it has also been shown that ahr is among the target genes for the activated nrf <dig> pathway and vice versa  <cit> . thus, a battery of protective enzymes are induced in response to a variety of xenobiotics, possibly through a number of signaling pathways, ultimately leading to the maturation of dendritic cells, as also indicated by the present data. the protein ubiquitination pathway is involved in degradation of short-lived or regulatory proteins involved in many cellular processes, such as the cell cycle, cell proliferation, apoptosis, dna repair, transcription regulation, cell surface receptors and ion channels regulation, and antigen presentation. of note, both nrf <dig> and ahr are in the resting cell bound by proteins that are targeted for ubiquitination upon ligand binding.

rxr is a nuclear receptor, with retinoic acid as the most prominent natural ligand  <cit> . it has previously been described as important for xenobiotics recognition and glutathione homeostasis, with cytoprotective enzymes as target genes  <cit> .

tlr signaling is known to play a major role in dendritic cell maturation, as they activate transcription of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokine-receptors for homing to lymph nodes and co-stimulatory molecules  <cit> . while tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are present in our prediction signature, others have reported tlr <dig> as a crucial mediator of contact allergy to nickel  <cit> . as these receptors all signal through nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells , it is not surprising that different compounds activate different receptors, considering the chemical diversity of skin sensitizers, as discussed above.

lastly, pka signaling is a vastly versatile pathway activated by numerous stimuli, and, to the best of knowledge, this pathway has not previously been reported in association with skin sensitization. however, individual species of cyps are known to be phosphorylated by pka, in response to elevated levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate , triggered by xenobiotics. in addition, camp levels influence the nuclear translocation of ahr, connecting these two pathways and their impact on cyp activity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have demonstrated the predictive power of a genomic biomarker signature, which correctly classifies sensitizers and non-sensitizers. the biomarker signature was derived from the human dc-like cell line mutz- <dig>  which was challenged with a panel of  <dig> reference chemical compounds. the biomarker genes were shown to be biologically relevant, as demonstrated by their involvement in cytoprotective mechanisms and pathways triggered by xenobiotic substances, supporting their relevance as predictor genes for skin sensitization. the findings reported in this paper might impact the development of in vitro assays for assessment of skin sensitization, which is crucial in order to replace the animal models currently in use.
