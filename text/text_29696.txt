BACKGROUND
over the past decades different expression systems have been developed for production of recombinant proteins. each of these systems has strengths and weaknesses concerning yield, cost, speed, ease of manipulation and folding and post-translational modifications of the target proteins. e. coli is the simplest and most widely used organism for protein expression due to low cost and ease of use but it has serious limitations for expression of mammalian gene products, particularly glycoproteins  <cit> . unmodified yeasts, as eukaryotes, are suitable for the production of proteins that do not require mammalian-type glycosylation  <cit> . however, cultured animal cells still remain the best system in which to produce mammalian glycoproteins, although they have complex nutritional requirements and are sensitive to viral and bacterial contamination  <cit> .

a repertoire of animal viruses has been grown in embryonated chicken eggs since the early 1930's  <cit> . eggs have also been used for large-scale production of viruses, aimed at obtaining purified proteins suitable for vaccines or for structural studies  <cit> . for example, the influenza haemagglutinin  <cit>   and neuraminidase  <cit>   ectodomains obtained after protease digestion of egg-grown virus have been crystallized and their structures solved by x-ray diffraction analysis. chicken eggs have the appealing properties of low cost and ease of manipulation for large-scale production of viruses and recombinant proteins.

since sendai virus  replicates very efficiently in eggs, we contemplated the possibility of using this virus as a vector for large-scale production of heterologous glycoproteins in the allantoic fluid of embryonated eggs. rescue of recombinant sev  <cit>  and other mononegavirales from cdna copies of their respective negative single-stranded rna genomes has been achieved, as well as expression of foreign proteins from the recombinant viruses  <cit> . however, cdna cloning and rescue of recombinant paramyxoviruses still entails laborious and time-consuming steps. these difficulties are circumvented in rescuing replication defective minigenomes. these are short negative-stranded rna molecules in which most of the internal coding sequences of the viral genome have been replaced by a reporter gene . paramyxovirus minigenomes obtained by cdna cloning can be amplified in transfected cells either expressing a minimal set of complementing viral proteins or superinfected with a wild type homologous helper virus. although the minigenome can then be amplified in tissue culture, sev replication is much more efficient in eggs than in cultured cells. therefore, a sev minigenome seemed an attractive and versatile vector for the expression of foreign proteins in chicken eggs.

two heterologous proteins were chosen for proof-of-principle experiments: i) a membrane-anchorless form of the human respiratory syncytial virus  fusion  glycoprotein  <cit>  and ii) a similar anchorless f protein of the recently identified human metapneumovirus  <cit>  . both, hrsv f and hmpv f are structural proteins that are synthesized as inactive f <dig> precursors that need to be cleaved proteolytically before becoming membrane-fusion competent. whereas hrsv f <dig> is cleaved twice at sites i and ii containing furin recognition sequences  <cit> , hmpv f <dig> is cleaved only once after a single arg residue  <cit> . both proteins are trimers in which each monomer is made of the two chains  generated after precursor cleavage. a membrane-anchorless hrsv f protein that lacks the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids , including the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, has been expressed in hep- <dig> cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus  <cit>  . hrsv/ftm- folds into trimers that are seen under the electron microscope as cone-shaped molecules  <cit> . an analogous rvv expressing an anchorless form of hmpv/f protein has been made .

RESULTS
the previously described ha-m-svec-36-cb <dig> plasmid  <cit>   carries a cdna sev minigenome, which encodes an ha tagged sev matrix protein , flanked by a t <dig> rna polymerase promoter and the hepatitis delta virus genomic ribozyme . transcription of svec/ha-m by the t <dig> polymerase results in a positive polarity rna that, after ribozyme self-cleavage, contains at both ends sev sequences required for replication and transcription by the sev polymerase. therefore, expression of the ha-m protein can be achieved by transfecting bsr-t7/ <dig> cells  <cit>   with svec/ha-m and three other plasmids encoding, also under a t <dig> promoter, the following set of complementing proteins: i) the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase encoded by the sev l gene, ii) the phosphoprotein , a cofactor of the viral polymerase and iii) the nucleoprotein , a major structural protein that binds tightly to both sev genome and anti-genome , protecting them from rnase degradation.

the ha-m sequence was replaced in the svec/ha-m plasmid by sequences encoding the ftm- forms of either hrsv f or hmpv f proteins . cloning was designed to follow the "rule of six" , a restriction imposed by the number of nucleotides interacting with each n protein monomer in the sev ribonucleoprotein complex  <cit> . then, brs-t7/ <dig> cells were transfected with svec plasmids encoding ha-m, hrsv/ftm- or hmpv/ftm- and the set of support plasmids. expression of the minigenome-encoded products in transfected cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence of parallel cultures with specific antibodies . twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were infected with sev that provided the required viral products for incorporation of the minigenome ribonucleoproteins into virus particles that would be found, together with wild type sev particles, in the supernatants of transfected/infected bsr-t7/ <dig> cells, constituting now a mixed virus stock; i.e. virus particles harboring minigenomes or full-length genomes.

the mixed sev stocks collected  <dig> hours after sev infection of bsr-t7/ <dig> cells were inoculated into 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for replication within cells of the choriallantoic membrane. amplification of the sev minigenome after each passage was evaluated indirectly by western blot of each recombinant protein. in parallel, multiplication of wild type sev was evaluated by western blot of the allantoic fluid with a monoclonal antibody  specific for the sev f protein. the amount of allantoic fluid in the western blots was standardized with an antibody specific for egg albumin . in general, a major band of the sendai virus f protein was detected after the first passage in eggs, whereas protein bands of the recombinant proteins were detected only after 2– <dig> passages. a cycling expression pattern was observed thereafter. maximal levels of ha-m, hrsv/ftm- or hmpv/ftm- proteins in allantoic fluids correlated with low expression levels of sev f protein and vice versa . this is likely to reflect the competition between minigenomes and full-length sev genomes for replication and incorporation into virus particles. minigenomes being shorter are expected to replicate more rapidly than full-length viral genomes. consequently, minigenomes should quickly outnumber full-length genomes in the infected cells and in the virus particles produced. however, since minigenome amplification and packaging requires helper virus functions, excess minigenome will result in a decrease in minigenome accumulation in the virus stock.

whereas essentially all the hrsv/ftm- was proteolitically processed to the f <dig> and f <dig> chains  about 50% of the hmpv/ftm- precursor remained unprocessed as f <dig> . this different behavior is likely to reflect the different proteolytic processing pathways of hrsv and hmpv f <dig> precursors mentioned above. the sev f protein was processed efficiently to generate the f <dig> chain detected with antibody gb <dig> 

the western blots of figure 2a show that the recombinant ftm- glycoproteins produced in eggs, in contrast to sev ha-m, remained essentially unassociated with sev particles. thus, after sedimentation of virions from the allantoic fluid, ha-m was found exclusively in the pellet fraction, in agreement with previous demonstration that this molecule can replace the matrix protein of helper sev in mature particles  <cit> . in contrast, hrsv/ftm- and hmpv/ftm- were found mainly, in their respective supernatants. the small amount of hrsv/ftm- found in the pellet was probably due to aggregates, generated after complete cleavage of monomers in the protein trimer  <cit> , that may have co-sedimented with sev particles.

as mentioned previously, the small size of plasmids containing cdna copies of sev minigenomes facilitates genetic manipulation of the encoded foreign gene. ftm- mutants could be easily obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the minigenomes. as an example, figure 3a shows the western blot of a hrsv/ftm- mutant , compared to ftm- wild type , in which the basic amino acids of the two furin sites were replaced by asn residues . expression of this mutant in eggs generated an anchorless f protein in which all monomers remained uncleaved , as shown previously for an equivalent mutant expressed from rvv  <cit> . inhibition of ftm- cleavage may be important to maintain this soluble protein unaggregated since, as reported previously, extensive cleavage of its monomers leads to formation of aggregates  <cit>  that sedimented with sev particles as seen in figure 2a.

the hrsv/ftm- protein produced in eggs has been found indistinguishable in a variety of tests  from that produced in cells infected with rvv. as an example, the nn mutant has been purified to homogeneity  following the same purification scheme used previously for purification of ftm- from the supernatant of rvv-infected cells  <cit> . electron microscopy of the purified ftm- nn protein after negative staining revealed the presence of unaggregated cone-shaped molecules  similar to those observed in preparations of the same protein from rvv-infected cells .

mononegavirales minigenomes expressing foreign reporter genes have been used extensively to dissect cis-acting sequences, including promoters, transcription signals and rna editing signals, as well as trans-acting factors required for replication and/or transcription  <cit> . this report adds to this list the use of mononegaviral  minigenomes for high yield production of recombinant soluble proteins in chicken eggs. although only soluble viral glycoproteins have been tested in this paper, there is no reason to believe that the system could not be used for the expression of non-viral glycoproteins, since the expressed molecules were not incorporated into virus particles  but were simply secreted to the allantoic fluid.

coronavirus minigenomes have been used for expression of heterologous proteins in piglets  <cit>  and active gamma-interferon in embryonated chicken eggs  <cit> , although estimation of the amount of foreign protein being expressed was not reported. however, instability of the heterologous gene in the coronavirus minigenome after 4– <dig> passages in tissue culture cells  <cit>  may be an important limitation for its use in the systematic production of recombinant proteins. in contrast, production of the foreign proteins by the sev minigenomes reported here was maintained at least after  <dig> passages in eggs , although following the cycling pattern depicted in figure 1c. nevertheless, high constant production of ftm- proteins was achieved by preparing large stocks of passage  <dig> that were then used to inoculate repetitively eggs for protein purification from passage  <dig> .

production of active human monoclonal antibodies  <cit>  and single-chain antibodies  <cit>  has been achieved in eggs of chimeric hens. expression levels were very high, although the recombinant proteins were found in the egg white that has a high ovalbumin concentration. whereas chimeric chickens may be useful bioreactors for expression of pharmaceutical molecules  <cit> , the intense labor- and time-consuming steps involved in obtaining the transgenic chickens limits the system versatility. in contrast, manipulation of the sev minigenome involves very simple steps that facilitate incorporation of foreign genes and generation of mutant heterologous proteins for comparative studies. expression of these recombinant proteins in the allantoic fluid, that has a limited number of chicken derived molecules, also facilitates the purification steps of the target proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the sev minigenome system described here represents a low-cost, simple and versatile approach for large-scale production of recombinant soluble glycoproteins in the allantoic fluid of chicken eggs.
