BACKGROUND
porcine respiratory tract diseases lead to high economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. clinical signs of disease can be reduced by vaccination against porcine respiratory tract pathogens, but under field conditions the protective effect is often limited in the case of multifactorial disease with several pathogens involved. in general, all vaccines available failed to prevent infection and transmission of pathogens  <cit> . in general, after the onset of acute respiratory disease on a farm, selected pigs are euthanized and necropsied to initiate bacteriological and virological examination of lung tissue. in addition, serological tests are performed in living pigs, which give information about contact with specific pathogens in the past, but not if lung tissue is affected or not  <cit> .

subclinically and chronically diseased animals do not show any clinical symptoms  <cit> ; consequently, they cannot be selected efficiently for further diagnostic procedures or sorted out prior to slaughter. therefore one clinical research aim in the field of diagnostic of respiratory diseases in pigs is to identify pigs with lung alterations which do not show clinical signs, to select them for further diagnostic procedures and by this increase the chance of a successful diagnosis as a basis for solving the herd problem.

the practicability of imaging techniques of the lung like digital radiography and computed tomography  is restricted by high personal and investigation costs  <cit> . ultrasonography was found to be more convenient but was of lower sensitivity, because lung lesions covered by aerated lung tissue were undetectable  <cit> .

infrared thermography  as an imaging method for the detection of elevated body temperature, circulatory disorders or circumscribed organ inflammation would be of high advantage in swine medicine because of its fast, cheap and non-invasive applicability.

one approach to overcome measurement inaccuracies due to a time-dependent drift error of the ir camera is the calculation of a difference temperature between two defined body localizations as an allocation base  <cit> . in the current study, temperature differences between regions of interest  were used to overcome irt device errors and variations between different irt images. selected anatomical localizations could be reproducibly found in the irt image. as depicted in the manufacturer’s instruction of the used ir camera measurement accuracy was ±  <dig> °c which is comparable to other ir cameras used in medicine diagnostics  <cit> .

dependence on ambient temperature is one major cause for the limited practical use of irt in medicine up to now. in several studies in veterinary medicine irt was tested as a diagnostic tool, e.g. to detect a pneumothorax in rats  <cit>  or spine diseases and neuromuscular disorders in horses  <cit> . in calves, the skin temperature around the eyes was found to be a sensitive marker to detect changes in thermoregulation due to respiratory disease  <cit> .

in pigs, irt failed as a diagnostic tool for arthritis, because thick subcutaneous fatty tissue layers prevented the detection of a local inflammatory temperature increase  <cit> .

in swine no reference values for thoracal skin temperatures in pigs with inflammatory lung alterations exist up to now. in the following study, a systematic approach was chosen to evaluate irt as a diagnostic tool for the detection of changes in the surface temperature pattern of the thorax after infection with the lung pathogen actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae .

the aim of this study was to examine the applicability of passive infrared thermography for the diagnostic of lung tissue alterations in pigs at different stages of infection. clinical examination and ct were used to assess the lung health status during the experiment as an allocation base for irt. comparison between both imaging techniques resulted in the determination of specific regions of interest  for temperature measurements. at the end of the study, irt findings were compared to findings from gross pathology and histological examinations.

RESULTS
animal model: clinical and post-mortem scores
prior to infection all animals were tested negative for a.pp. in an apx-ii-enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays  and were defined as healthy according to a clinical score  and a ct score . after infection, challenged pigs developed respiratory disease of varying severity reflected by increased cls, cts, lung lesion scores  and scores according to s.p.e.s. . a significant correlation was found between the s.p.e.s. score and the lls .table  <dig>

several animals showed typical signs of acute pleuropneumonia, as elevated body temperature up to  <dig> °c, dyspnoea, coughing, apathy and vomiting.

twelve pigs had to be euthanized before the end of the experiment, because they suffered from generalized systemic disease with severe dyspnoea. they underwent ct and infrared thermographical examination prior to gross pathological examination.

the acute stage of infection was characterized by disseminated lung tissue alterations recorded by ct.

on day  <dig> after infection significant correlations were found between cls, cts and lls . gross pathological findings ranged from normal lung tissue to severe pleuropneumoniae.

pigs of the control group stayed healthy until the end of the experiment.

surface skin temperatures measured by infrared thermography  during experimental infection and influencing factors

surface skin temperatures as well as temperature differences between thoracal and abdominal regions on the left and right body sites were influenced by several internal and external factors. pearsson´s correlation coefficients  between dependent and influencing variables, their levels of significance  and the number of evaluated pigs  are shown.



because individual pigs were examined subsequently by irt imaging in a cooled chamber on fixed examination days, ambient temperature increased in parallel to the duration of examination due to the presence of the warm, living pigs and the examiner. the high impact also of a relatively cold ambient temperature  onto sensitivity and specificity of the method is reflected in the results of irt measurements in this trial.

student´s t-test for independent samples as well as t-tests for paired observations for the comparison of different stages of infection were performed with those pigs, which have been examined within an ambient temperature range of 7-14°c on all examination days . a significant difference between infected pigs and control pigs was found for the left skin surface difference temperature between lung roi and abdominal roi.figure  <dig>

differences in absolute skin surface temperatures between control pigs and infected pigs were significant already prior to infection , which might be due to the described order of examination. control pigs were examined always at first in a relatively cool environment to avoid infection. a significant correlation was found between ambient temperature and thoracal skin surface temperatures .

this obvious influence of ambient temperature onto the thoracal skin surface temperature was statistically corrected in an analysis of covariance. the corrected data revealed diagnostic significance for the skin surface temperature difference between abdominal and thoracal region on the left body site in the height of the 10th thoracic vertebrae  during the acute stage of infection

as a result of this study, potential cut-offs were suggested, which might allow a practical application of irt by a specific preselection of pigs for further diagnostics although the method is influenced by ambient temperature and other internal factors.

during the acute stage of infection a cut off of 28°c of absolute right thoracal temperature resulted in a specificity of the method of 100%  and a sensitivity of 66%  as shown in figure 3a. a cut off of 2°c temperature difference between thoracal and abdominal region on the left body site resulted in a specificity of 100%  and a sensitivity of 32%  .figure  <dig>

maximal abdominal temperatures continuously increased with the days of examination in parallel to an increase in the body weight.

at the chronic stage of infection the lung lesion score was negatively correlated to body weight  and positively correlated to the clinical  and the ct score . no correlations were found between lung lesion and ct scores and the temperature parameters measured by irt.

validity of lung biopsy
a.pp. could be reisolated from lung biopsies in twelve out of  <dig> infected pigs. while the overall a.pp. detection rate using this method in comparison to positive lung tissue samples was 19-51% , all ten pigs with severe clinical symptoms, which had been sampled until day  <dig> after infection, had positive findings for a. pp. in bioptates .

only two animals belonging to the four pigs with the highest clinical score and showing also high lung lesion scores were a.pp.-positive in lung biopsy samples on day  <dig> after infection. lung tissue samples of the respective pigs were also highly positive. lung tissue samples of twenty-seven pigs were highly positive for a.pp., while in five pigs only moderate and in four pigs only low a.pp.-isolation rates were found . a.pp. was not reisolated from lung tissue of  <dig> pigs. a histological examination of lung tissue confirmed pneumonia and pleuritis in  <dig> out of  <dig> infected pigs .figure  <dig>

discussion
the aim of this study was to evaluate irt as an imaging technique for the diagnostic of respiratory disease in swine. during the trial in living pigs the diagnostic potential of irt was controlled by ct examination.

planning of the study was directed by preliminary findings supporting the hypothesis, that gross pathological lung lesions can be successfully detected in pigs by irt and that the difference temperature between lung region and abdominal region is smaller in pigs with lung alterations due to an inflammatory increase in lung temperature  <cit> . optimal rois for irt on the pig thorax had been previously specified by measurement of tissue layer thicknesses in various anatomical positions .

in general, irt is a simple and non-invasive method to assess the surface temperature distribution of the body  <cit> . an increase in temperature is a basic physical reaction towards a harmful stimulus and is one sign of inflammation besides swelling, pain and redness.

also under physiological conditions skin temperature - as the outer contact organ of the body with the environment - is influenced by many external and internal factors, e.g. sweat evaporation, vascular perfusion, local tissue metabolism and ambient temperature  <cit> . anyhow, infrared thermographical images captured under controlled conditions might be interpretable to diagnose specific pathological conditions and might be a helpful tool to monitor specific body reactions towards stress, especially thermal stress  <cit> . a satisfying reproducibility of irt in a temperature-controlled environment has been shown previously  <cit> .

as hypothezised, mean absolute surface temperatures of the thorax were rising after aerosol challenge during the acute stage of infection , when highest values were recorded. this temperature increase reflects inflammatory mechanisms in the lung  as well as systemic reactions . in contrast to that, prior to infection, absolute surface temperatures were lower. surface temperatures during the chronic stage of infection were slightly higher than those measured prior to infection but lower than in the acute stage of infection. the chronic stage of a.pp.-infection is characterized by sequestrated necrotic lung tissue, which is surrounded by a fibrotic capsule. in these altered lung areas neither tissue ventilation, nor blood circulation occur. obviously these chronic inflammatory processes led not to an increased tissue blood perfusion accompanied by an increase in temperature which can be detected from the outside by irt. local temperatures in lung tissue sequesters might be lower than in non-affected lung areas.

using difference temperatures  between the lung roi and the abdominal roi as an allocation base for the detection of inflammatory lung disorders, sensitivity and specificity of the method should be further improved for routine measurements under practical conditions. the hypothesis was that Δϑ was highest prior to infection, due to physiological ventilation of lung tissue with cool air. during the acute stage of infection, when lung tissue was heated due to inflammation, Δϑ was supposed to decrease. in contrast to that, in patient animals Δϑ was not significantly different between the examination prior to infection and after infection. a significant difference was found between day  <dig> and  <dig> after infection with a higher difference temperature in the chronic stage of infection.

the high significant difference between lower absolute right lung roi temperatures prior to infection in comparison to higher temperatures on day  <dig> after infection was found in all group constellations of patients. in parallel a higher difference temperature between lung and abdominal roi was observed on day  <dig> after infection, which was contradictory to the hypothesis. this might be due to a steeper temperature increase of the abdominal rois on both body sites, which was obviously not proportional to a temperature increase of the lung rois.

the statistical comparison of patient animals with control animals showed, that infected pigs have disease-dependent thoracal surface temperature changes during the acute stage of infection, while no difference was found between both groups on day  <dig> after infection.

in the chronic stage of infection, three weeks later, abdominal roi temperature significantly increased from day  <dig> to day  <dig> after infection in control pigs and to a much lesser extent in the patient pigs. briefly, in healthy pigs a higher growth-dependent increase in abdominal than in lung temperature can be assumed. additionally, differences in abdominal temperatures might be also due to differences in digestive activities. feed depriviation before examination was at least 12 hours in all animals. nevertheless, severity of disease affected the appetite of the pigs, so that individual differences in feed consumption occurred during the trial. some animals still had intestinal contents during examination. the localization of intestine and liver tissue might also be an influencing factor onto thoracal temperatures. the left lung roi was located at the height of the 10th vertebra where liver tissue was underlying. filling of the stomach can dislocate the liver in a more cranial position close to the lung. liver tissue is known to be approximately 1-2°c warmer than the body core temperature  <cit> .

the chronological order of the examination of piglets is assumed to be also a factor influencing the thoracal surface. to avoid contamination of the healthy control pigs with a.pp., they were always examined at first. for this reason the cooled chamber was warmer when patients were examined . as previously published, ambient temperature strongly affects the results of irt measurements, although optimal ambient temperatures for irt have been reported to be <18°c, which was realized in this study  <cit> .

not only the effect of ambient temperature on irt measurement results might limit the application of this method on farms, but also the relative long time until an adequate irt picture can be produced . anatomical landmarks should be visible in the picture, so that the correct rois can be positioned for later temperature evaluation. non-anaesthetized pigs are moving continuously, which will impair the quality of pictures. for this reason further technical improvement of irt cameras will be necessary to pave the way for this technique for practical usage.

for the use of irt adequate facilities and a profound knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the examined species and the pathophysiology of the disease which should be examined might be important to avoid misdiagnosis. because mostly several different bacterial and viral pathogens are involved in porcine respiratory diseases, also lung alterations will be a combination of different gross pathological findings. a detection of these inconsistent inflammatory findings might be even more difficult than those findings reported after experimental mono-infection in this study. also under standardized external conditions, irt is error-prone due to several influencing endogenous factors whose impact cannot adequately be corrected. irt is not sensitive enough to assess the prevalence of pigs with lung alterations in a herd. but, using a cut off with a high specificity as suggested in this study, irt might be a promising tool to detect pigs without clinical symptoms but with lung alterations. using this 2-step diagnostic approach would enable a more targeted and cost-effective diagnostic of respiratory disease.

bacteriological examination of lung tissue bioptates of infected pigs resulted in a.pp. reisolation in 24% of all animals. all animals with severe clinical symptoms, which were euthanized during the first days after infection, had positive findings for a. pp. in bioptates. only 5% of pigs were detected positive by lung bioptates on day  <dig> after infection. for this reason, lung biopsy can be assessed to be a diagnostic option for a. pp. detection only during the acute stage of infection. biopsy of the lung is highly invasive and can cause further problems as bleeding and sudden death.

it can be concluded, that the assessment of irt for the diagnostic of lung alterations requires a comparison of infected and non-infected pigs of the same age and under same ambient temperature conditions. the interpretation of findings is complicated by a non-proportional, partly growth-dependent change in surface temperature of different body regions.

in this study, most appropriate surface temperature parameters for the diagnostic of the lung health status of pigs are the absolute temperature of the right thoracal region in the height of the 7th thoracic vertebra as well as the temperature difference between thoracal and abdominal region on the left body site on the height of the 10th thoracic vertebra.

with a next generation of irt cameras both localizations should be further evaluated for their diagnostic significance in non-anaesthetized piglets with and without lung diseases and under moderate ambient temperature conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
using irt lung alternations are better detectable in the acute stage of infection 4 days after infection than in the chronic stage of infection 21 days after infection. the method is interfering with external and internal factors which have to be regarded during the examination and analysis. especially the effect of ambient temperature on skin surface temperatures visualized in ir-images always has to be considered. the assessment of irt requires a comparison of infected and non-infected pigs of the same age and under same ambient temperature conditions. the application of this tool in the field might be restricted to a selection of pigs for further diagnostic with adequate specificity.
