BACKGROUND
micrornas are small, single-stranded rnas, usually  <dig> nucleotides in length, for the first time identified in ceanorhabditis elegans, and then in various other eukaryotic species which play a key regulatory role in gene expression at the posttranscriptional level
 <cit> . arabidopsis thaliana was the first plant species in which the existence of mirnas was demonstrated
 <cit> . further studies have confirmed the existence of mirnas in all plant species studied
 <cit> . the regulatory roles of mirnas have been demonstrated in plant development, signal transduction, protein degradation, response to environmental stress, and pathogen invasion
 <cit> . additionally, mirnas can regulate their own biogenesis, as shown in the case of mir <dig>  the mir <dig> precursor is localized in the dicer-like  <dig>  intron  <dig>  dicing out of the pre-mir <dig> leads to dcl <dig> mrna degradation, which decreases the level of dcl <dig>  a key protein in mirna biogenesis
 <cit> .

mirnas, together with their almost perfect complementary partners, called mirnas*, form a duplex located in the stem of a hairpin structure . pre-mirnas are embedded within primary-mirnas , which are long products of rna polymerase ii activity that possess their characteristic 5′ cap and 3′ polya tail
 <cit> . mirnas can be located in either arm of a pre-mirna stem. in plants, the enzyme engaged in trimming the pri-mirna hairpins, as well as dicing out mirna-mirna* duplexes, is called dcl1
 <cit> . the dcl <dig> together with serrate  and hyponastic leaves  <dig> , forms microprocessing complex
 <cit>  that ensures efficiency and accuracy of pri-mirna to mirna processing
 <cit> . the efficiency of pri-mirna recruitment to dcl1-hyl1-se complex is stimulated by a rna binding protein tough 
 <cit> , whereas the accuracy of pri-mirna processing requires hyl <dig> dephosphorylation triggered by a c-terminal domain phosphatase-like  <dig> 
 <cit> . se cooperates with a cap-binding complex  to ensure the proper processing of pri-mirnas
 <cit> . another protein involved in a proper plant mirna biogenesis is called sicle . however, its exact function is elusive
 <cit> . the 3′ termini of mirna/mirna* duplexes are 2′-o-methylated by hua enhancer  <dig>  methyltransferase to prevent 3′–5′ degradation or 3′ uridylation
 <cit> . after hasty -driven export of the duplex to the cytoplasm, the mirna is loaded into the rna-induced silencing complex 
 <cit> , while the mirna* is usually degraded
 <cit> . the mirna-loaded risc directs posttranscriptional silencing of the target mrna, or triggers microrna-directed phasing during trans-acting sirna biogenesis
 <cit> . due to the almost perfect complementarity of mirna to its target mrna, it is widely assumed the target mrna is predominantly cleaved
 <cit> . however, there are examples of translation suppression without mrna cleavage, as has been shown for the ath-mir172-triggered downregulation of apetala <dig> expression level
 <cit> . similar to animal models, studies on a. thaliana mirna-action mutants have revealed the existence of translational repression by mirnas
 <cit> .

as previously mentioned, mirna biogenesis produces obligatory side products from dcl1-triggered cleavage of pre-mirnas that results in mirnas* originating from the strand opposite to the mature mirna. while the expression of mirnas* is rarely detected due to their rapid degradation
 <cit> , there are some examples of animal mirna* that remain stable. it has been shown that these stable mirna* are incorporated into risc complexes to posttranscriptionally downregulate mrna translation
 <cit> . it has been demonstrated in the case of human mirna- <dig> and its partner mirna-155*, that both of them regulate type i interferon production
 <cit> . an increasing amount of deep sequencing data for plant small rnas has provided a basis for describing some examples of substantial mirna* representation. the physiological roles of these molecules have yet to be established. supposing mirnas* participate in the posttranscriptional silencing of targeted mrnas, it is still not known whether they are involved in regulation of the same biological pathway as their cognate mirnas. nevertheless, it has been demonstrated for the mir393/mir393* pair that they both regulate plant immune responses through different cellular pathways
 <cit> .

although hundreds of plant mirnas have been identified, their pri-mirnas and genes are mostly unknown. as was demonstrated for arabidopsis, plant mirna precursors can be hundreds or thousands of nucleotides long, with many containing one or more introns that undergo constitutive or alternative splicing
 <cit> . while plant mir genes are predominately located in intergenic loci, there have been an increasing number of examples of intragenic mir loci located within introns of protein coding genes
 <cit> . the mirtrons represent a class of intron-encoded mirnas which are processed from spliced-out introns and constitute hairpin substrates for the dicing machinery
 <cit> . there are  <dig> mirtrons identified in different plant species: five in a. thaliana,  <dig> in rice, and one in cassava 
 <cit> . the existence of plant polycistronic mirna genes that carry multiple mirnas has been shown in a. thaliana, oryza sativa and physcomitrella patens <cit> . bioinformatic analyses suggest that mir genes may also overlap with protein coding genes. in a. thaliana, the mir <dig> gene partly covers the 5′ utr of the protein-coding gene at1g <dig> <cit> . another surprising finding was the discovery of osa-mir <dig>  which is located in the last exon of the putative glyoxylase mrna in rice
 <cit> . these reports suggest there might be additional examples of mir genes overlapping with protein-coding genes. regulated co-expression of protein/mirna-coding genes remains unknown.

barley is an economically important monocotyledonous crop plant. however, little is known about barley mirna precursors and there is no data on mir gene structures. high-throughput sequencing of conserved and novel small rnas is widely used for computational scanning of genomic sequences in search of mirna genes. a bioinformatic search of est sequences resulted in a set of predicted potential pre-mirnas, but until now there has been no experimental evidence validating these data
 <cit> . currently, deep sequencing of barley small rnas gained a set of detailed information concerning mature barley mirnas
 <cit> . lv et al.
 <cit>  has identified  <dig> mature mirnas  from which  <dig> mirnas were deposited into mirbase 
 <cit> . currently, there are  <dig> barley mirna sequences and  <dig> pre-mirna structures deposited in mirbase. however, none of the precursor structures have been validated using experimental approaches. moreover, primary mirna transcripts, as well as the genes for barley mirnas, remain unknown.

in this study, we show experimental evidence for nine conserved barley mirnas and their pre- and pri-mirna precursors, as well as their gene structures. our findings reveal a diverse organization of barley mirna genes, as well as expression levels of pre-mirna and mirna primary transcripts in five barley developmental stages studied. furthermore, we show complex processing events of pri-mirnas, with different pathways leading to various levels of mature mirnas being observed in particular developmental stages. a regulatory role of posttranscriptional processing of pri-mirnas is postulated.

RESULTS
to determine the structures of mirna genes and their transcripts, we selected eight barley cdna nucleotide sequences for micrornas precursors - 156g, 159b, 166n, 168a-5p/168a-3p, 171e, 397b-3p,  <dig> and  <dig> - deposited in genebank,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ <cit>   for which computationally predicted hairpin structures, carrying conserved or newly estimated mirna homologues, were described
 <cit> . moreover, we followed their expression profiles at the level of pri-mirnas, pre-mirnas, and mature mirnas in the following developmental stages: 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-week-old, and 68-day-old plants. we designed 5′ and 3′ race primers to determine the full-length sequences of the pri-mirna transcripts for all pri-mirnas analyzed. on the basis of the nucleotide sequences and hairpin structural similarities, we have identified the barley mirna genes in this study as the orthologues of corresponding genes in rice or wheat. we named the barley mirna genes according to their matching rice or wheat orthologues. the total length of the pri-mirna precursors was calculated on the basis of the longest 5′ and 3′ race products. for all barley pri-mirnas, rt-pcr was carried out using primers designed against the 5′ and 3′ ends of the longest pri-mirna race products to confirm that the longest pri-mirna 5′ and 3′ ends belong to the same precursor molecule. in addition, qrt-pcr was performed to compare the level of all pri-mirnas in the developmental stages studied.

we designed 5′ and 3′ genome walking primers to determine the sequences and structures of the barley mirna genes. the intron-exon structure of the barley mirna genes was established by alignment of the pri-mirna sequences coming from race and rt-pcr experiments with genomic fragments obtained by genome walking, as well as by using the fsplice program
 <cit> . the structure and length for each barley mirna gene, the position of its mirna within the gene, and its rice or wheat orthologues are presented in table 
 <dig> 

# the gene nucleotide numeration starts at the first nucleotide of the gene.

^ based on nucleotide sequence and hairpin structure similarities we classified barley mirs as orthologues of rice or wheat.

mir397b-3p: mir* or functional mirna?
surprisingly, out of the eight mir genes analyzed, mir397b-3p was the only intronless gene . based on the nucleotide sequence and hairpin structural similarities, we classified barley mir <dig> as an orthologue of rice mir397b b. the annotated osa-mir397b is located in the 5′ arm of the hairpin structure. we failed to detect barley mir397b-5p molecules corresponding to osa-mir397b when northern hybridization was used . surprisingly, we detected relatively high levels of barley mir397b-3p, the molecule that corresponds to rice mir397b* . this result may suggest that mir397b-3p is a functional microrna molecule in hordeum vulgare. this observation is in agreement with the recently published results of jeong et al.
 <cit> , who showed that in rice, relatively highly expressed annotated mirna*s of mir529a, mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are likely to be true mirnas and not mirna*s.

detailed analysis showed that the lowest level of mir397b-3p was observed in 1-week-old plants, while the highest level was seen in 3-week-old plants . using a hybridization probe complementary to the 5′ arm of the stem and loop of the hairpin structure, we were able to detect the precursor of mir397b-3p, which is approximately  <dig> nucleotides  long. amplification of the whole pri-mir397b-3p  as well as real-time pcr experiments  revealed the presence of a single transcript expressed almost equally in all developmental stages examined. however, there was no correlation between the level of precursor and mature mir397b-3p, most likely due to detection of putative mir <dig> molecules belonging to the same microrna <dig> family encoded by other loci.

pre-mir159b belongs to the longest known barley precursors’ hairpins
the detailed structures of the mir159b gene and its pre-mirna are shown in figure 
2a and b. comparison of the barley pre-mir159b stem and loop structure to  <dig> barley pre-mirnas deposited in mirbase  revealed that this precursor forms one of the longest hairpins which is  <dig> nt long b. rt-pcr of full-length barley pri-mir159b transcripts demonstrated the presence of both unspliced  and spliced isoforms  c with almost the same expression level . we observed high expression levels of mature mir <dig> using northern hybridization, however, we failed to detect pre-mir159b, which was most likely a result of rapid processing of the pre-mirna . our observations show that the level of mature mir <dig> fluctuates in various developmental stages with the lowest expression level detected in 1-week-old plants, which is in agreement with the real-time pcr results for pri-mir159b . it has to be noted that northern analysis shows the expression of all putative mature mir <dig> family members. in arabidopsis, three members of the mir <dig> family were annotated - mir159a, b and c
 <cit>  - while for monocotyledonous species such as rice and maize, eight and fourteen members of the mir <dig> family have been described, respectively
 <cit> . lv et al.
 <cit>  described three barley mir <dig> species with different nucleotide sequences. mir159b described by us differs in its nucleotide sequence from the three species found by lv et al.
 <cit> . our studies, together with recent results of lv et al. and mirbase, reveal that the mir <dig> family in barley consists of at least four members.

mir166n generates two transcripts with heterogeneous, developmentally specific 5′ ends
the detailed structure of the mir166n gene and its pre-mirna are shown in figure 
3a and b. mir <dig> is represented by a very large gene family in both monocot and dicot plants. its members target mrnas coding for hd-zipiii transcription factors, including phabulosa  and phavoluta , which regulate axillary meristem initiation and leaf development
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, the mir <dig> family consists of seven members
 <cit> , whereas in both rice and maize,  <dig> mir166s were annotated
 <cit> . concerning the barley mir <dig> family, so far only three members, including mir166a, b and c, have been annotated in mirbase  among which only mir166b has been experimentally confirmed
 <cit> . however, despite the identical sequences of mature mir166b and mir166n species, the nucleotide sequences of their pre-mirnas are different, confirming that the mir166n described in this paper is a novel member of the mir <dig> family in barley. interestingly, we identified two heterogeneous 5′ ends for the mir166n transcript, separated by  <dig> nt . using 5′ and 3′ flanking primers for pri-mir166n amplification, we detected two transcript variants: a longer isoform present only in 1-week-old plants, and a shorter form detected in all developmental stages analyzed . in the case of the 1-week-old plants, it is possible that we amplified the shorter transcript using the longer one as a template. however, it was not possible to amplify the longer transcript using the shorter one as a template in the case of 2-, 3-, 6-week and 68-day-old plants. this heterogeneity in the 5′ ends of pri-mirna was also found in arabidopsis mirna precursors. for example, pri-mir169f is represented by two transcripts with 5′ ends that are  <dig> nt apart, while for pri-mir172e, the two most distal of the three identified 5′ ends are  <dig> nt apart
 <cit> .

 <dig>  colors, abbreviations, and symbols as in figure 
 <dig> 

the qrt-pcr analysis confirmed the presence of the mir166n precursor in all developmental stages tested . the lowest expression level of the pri-mir166n was detected in 6-week-old plants as it was also detected in rt-pcr experiments . in addition, we analyzed the existence of spliced  and unspliced  isoforms of the mir166n precursor . during barley development, both the spliced and unspliced precursor variants were present on an almost equal level in each growth stage tested.

using northern hybridization, we identified two pre-mir166n forms varying in length by approximately  <dig> nt . the shorter form  was around  <dig> nt long, while the other  was about  <dig> nt long. the shorter form of the mir166n precursor may represent the hairpin structure, with the stem having mirna and mirna* at the base of this hairpin, while the longer form may correspond to the same hairpin form with an extended stem. the shorter form of pre-mr166n is more abundant compared to the longer one. the highest expression level of pre-mir166n detected in 1-week-old plants corresponded to the lowest level of mature mir <dig> observed in the same growth stage. the level of the mature mir <dig> reached its highest level in 2-week-old plants. in general, our observations show that the mir <dig> level fluctuates when various developmental stages are compared .

mir168a-5p and mir168a-3p are generated from the same precursor and differ in their expression levels
the detailed structures of mir168a-5p/168a-3p gene and its pre-mirna are shown in figure 
4a and b. mir <dig> is a relatively small family consisting of only two members in a. thaliana , three members in o. sativa  and four in zea mays 
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> targets mrna coding for the argonaute  protein, which is crucial for mirna function; hence mir <dig> is involved in a negative-feedback mechanism for controlling all mirnas biogenesis
 <cit> . real-time pcr data have shown that transcripts of mir168a-5p/168a-3p were present in all developmental stages tested . the expression level of the intron-containing isoform  is higher than of the isoform without intron  in all developmental stages studied . similar to pre-mir166n, the expression of two different forms of the mir168a-5p/mir168a-3p precursor was detected by northern analysis. the shorter form of the precursor , approximately  <dig> nt long, may correspond to the pre-mirna having mir168a-5p and mir168a-3p located at the base of the stem, while the longer form  has the extended stem. the expression level of the longer precursor was elevated compared to expression of the shorter one .
 <dig>   pri-mirna168a-5p/168-3p structures  and rt-pcr analysis of their expression in five barley developmental stages .  real-time pcr measurements of pri-mirna mirna168a-5p/168-3p expression levels  and its spliced  and unspliced variants  ; bars on the charts represent standard deviation. values are shown as the mean ±sd  from three independent experiments.  nucleotide sequences of the mature mir168a-5p and mir168a-3p molecules, and northern detection of pre-mirna168a-5p/168-3p long  and short  intermediates, mature mir168-5p and mir168a-3p. u <dig> was used as a loading control. the levels of pre-mirnas and mirna were calculated as described in figure 
 <dig>  colors, abbreviations, and symbols as in figure 
1; asterisk next to band on agarose gel marks nonspecific product.

interestingly, in addition to the expression of mature mir168-5p, we also observed the expression of mir168-3p . there are two possible explanations for this observation:  as postulated for rice and maize, both mir168-5p and mir168-3p molecules could be functional in barley
 <cit>  or  mir168-3p represents a relatively stable molecule of mirna*. it should be noted that a target mrna sequence for the mir168-3p molecule has not yet been identified. using psrnatarget software , we identified a potential target barley mrna  encoding a protein similar to a ubiquitin-like protein from triticum aestivum. the expression level of the mature mir168-5p is notably stronger than the mir168-3p. the expression profiles of mirna168-5p/168-3p in particular developmental stages also differed, which may suggest a functional role of both mirna species, as was reported for mir319b and mir319b. <dig> in arabidopsis <cit> .

intron-containing pri-mir171e undergoes complex splicing events during development
the detailed structures of mir171e gene and its pre-mirna are shown in figure 
5a and b. in the case of the mir171e precursor, alternatively spliced transcripts were detected . what is more interesting the single u <dig> intron can undergo three independent events of alternative splicing. first, proximal to the 5′ end of pri-mirna, 5′ and 3′ splice sites  can be selected resulting in extension of the 3′ exon by  <dig> nt . second, distal 5′ ss and 3′ ss can be selected that result in the 5′ exon’s length increasing by  <dig> nt . third, proximal 5′ ss and distal 3′ ss can be selected, resulting in the removal of a  <dig> nt long intron . the long intron sequence  covers both shorter introns described above . all four variants were confirmed by rt-pcr and the subsequent sequencing of the amplification products . we cannot rule out the possibility that the fully spliced precursor may also be a product of a two-step splicing event, where proximal 5′ ss and proximal 3′ ss are selected in the first step, and distal 5′ ss and distal 3′ ss at the second one. the level of pri-mir171e is almost the same during developmental stages as revealed by qrt-pcr measurements . all four isoforms of the mir171e precursor were detected using real-time pcr . the expression level of the isoform i containing full-length intron was the highest in all developmental stages tested. the lowest expression of the isoform iii might explain the difficulties with its rt-pcr detection using the peripheral primers .

 <dig>  colors, abbreviations, and symbols as in figure 
 <dig> 

using northern hybridization, we detected the mature mir <dig> in all growth stages tested, with a notably elevated level in 3-week-old plants . northern analysis also revealed two pre-mir171e variants - a shorter one of approximately  <dig> nt , which might correspond to the precursor of the hairpin structure with mir171e/mir171e* at the base of the stem, and a longer variant, approximately  <dig> nt long , which might represent the same precursor with the extended stem. interestingly, the level of shortened pre-mirna171e was highest in the 3-week-old plants, which corresponds to the highest level of the mature mirna observed in the same developmental stage. taken together, the developmental analysis of the processing of the mir171e transcript shows a complex landscape of various splicing events that suggests potential regulatory role of splicing in mature microrna biogenesis.

mir156g and mir <dig> are encoded within introns of noncoding genes
the mir156g and mir <dig> genes are especially interesting, since their precursors were found within introns . the position of mir156g is close to the 5′ end of the first intron, while the mir <dig> sequence is located almost in the middle of the third intron . our analysis has revealed that open reading frames  can be identified in both genes. since they are relatively short  to putative  <dig> aa – additional file
1) without significant similarities to any protein sequences deposited in various protein databases, we consider these genes as noncoding. however, it has been shown that  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt orfs in the 5′ end of a legume enod <dig> gene  are translated into two short peptides involved in the control of sucrose use in nitrogen-fixing nodules
 <cit> . the presence of the potential proteins encoded by mir156g and mir <dig> genes should therefore be verified by further studies.

 <dig> 

the mir156g gene consists of six exons and five introns with both mir156g and mir156g* sequences localized within the first intron . all introns carry u2-type signatures. based on nucleotide sequence and structural similarities, we classify barley mir <dig> as an orthologue of rice mir156g . our analysis revealed that mir156g from rice is also intron-encoded, within the p0701f <dig>  gene, described as encoding a hypothetical  <dig> aa protein. this finding suggests an evolutionary conservation of intron-encoded mir156g organization.

using 5′ and 3′ race results and full transcript analyses, we detected eight splice isoforms . isoform i is polyadenylated within the second intron, while isoforms ii to viii are polyadenylated within the last exon . isoforms i–v maintain the first intron in which mir156g is embedded, but the remaining bodies of the precursors represent various alternatively spliced variants. isoforms vi–viii do not contain the microrna-encoding intron, and while still representing splice variants of the same gene transcript, they cannot be named as genuine mirna precursors. this high number of splice variants of the mir156g gene indicates a very complex processing of its transcript.

the level of pri-mir156g is the lowest in the 6-week-old plants as revealed by qrt-pcr analysis . using primers anchored in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  we confirmed the presence of the unspliced isoform containing pre-mir156g in all developmental stages . real-time pcr analyses revealed that the expression level of the transcript with spliced intron  <dig> was gradually decreasing, while the level of the intron  <dig> containing product fluctuates during development .

using primers anchored in exon  <dig> and the second intron, we detected rt-pcr products containing intron  <dig> in 1- and 2-week-old plants, while there was no product in the other three developmental stages . these results suggest that intron  <dig> is spliced from the precursor more efficiently than intron  <dig> . using primers specific for the first and last exons, we amplified various rt-pcr products of partially spliced mir156g transcripts . the obtained pattern of rt-pcr splice isoform products is very complex because of dynamic processing events. therefore the observed complex pattern of multiple splice isoforms can slightly vary between biological replicates. the introns numbered 2– <dig> were spliced in all identified products. the only intron maintained was the first one containing pre-mir156g. these results confirm and extend our previous suggestion that intron  <dig> is spliced less efficiently, not only in comparison to the second intron, but also compared to the other introns of pri-mir156g.

northern hybridization confirmed expression of the approximately 120nt long pre-mir156g in all growth stages tested. hybridization also revealed the presence of two mature mir <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nt long . the  <dig> nt long mature mir <dig> was previously identified in barley using deep sequencing
 <cit> . a  <dig> nt long mature mir <dig> with an additional adenosine residue at the 3′ end is annotated in the databases of many eukaryotic species
 <cit> . both the  <dig> and  <dig> nt mir <dig> species were equally represented in 6-week- and 68-day-old plants; however, in 1- and 2-week-old plants, primarily the  <dig> nt long mir <dig> was detectable. both  <dig> and  <dig> nt long mir <dig> were expressed at the highest level in 68-day-old plants.

the mir <dig> gene consists of seven exons and six introns, with mir <dig> and mir1126* localized within the third intron . all introns are u <dig> type. a search for the presence of orf regions within the gene sequence resulted in the identification of three putative sequences:  <dig> aa,  <dig> aa, and the longest  <dig> aa . no conserved domains were detected in these coding sequences  and no significant similarities to known proteins were found. thus, we concluded that the identified orfs most probably do not represent cds and do not encode proteins.

in the case of the intron-encoded mir <dig> precursor, similar to pri-mir156g, a plethora of splicing isoforms was observed when 5′ and 3' race experiments, as well as rt-pcr amplifications of the full transcripts, were carried out. among the many rt-pcr products, we identified five splice isoforms . we found the fully spliced transcript , as well as transcripts retaining the last intron , and an isoform retaining both the first and the last introns  . in contrast to mir156g, none of the identified spliced isoforms contained mir <dig> or mir1126*, thus they cannot be named pri-mirnas. using a 5′ primer anchored in the third intron upstream of mir1126/mir1126*, and the most peripheral 3′ primer anchored in the last exon, we were able to amplify precursors containing the intron sequence with mir <dig> and mir1126* in all developmental stages studied . real-time pcr analyses confirmed that splice isoforms i–iii lacking intron  <dig> were present in higher amount in comparison to the precursor isoforms iv and v containing intron  <dig> . the observed tendency to maintain the intron-containing mir156g within the transcript, and preferences in splicing the mir1126-harboring intron, may suggest the existence of special regulation of the levels of intron-derived mirnas in barley.

qrt-pcr of pri-mir <dig> shows the highest expression level in 3-week-old plants , which is in agreement with the highest level of pri-mir <dig> in 3-week-old plants detected by northern hybridization . the mature barley mir <dig> molecule is  <dig> nt long, the same as reported for wheat mir <dig> . a sequence comparison between barley and wheat mir <dig> revealed differences in two nucleotide positions. we confirmed the presence of the mature mir <dig> and its corresponding precursor molecule in all developmental stages analyzed .

is mirna <dig>  located in the 3′ utr of a putative protein encoding gene, a functional microrna?
mirna <dig> was located in the 3′ utr of a protein coding gene. this gene structure is presented in figure 
8a. interestingly, two introns in the putative protein/mir <dig> gene  carry the signatures of u12-type introns, with gu-ag dinucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ intron ends, and the classic u <dig> branch point site 
 <cit> . u <dig> introns are rarely present in plant genes, and it is very rare to have two u <dig> introns within a single gene
 <cit> . the other introns are of the canonical u2-type. sequences corresponding to the mature mir <dig> and mir1120* were located downstream of the stop codon in the 3′ utr . the orf is  <dig> base pairs , and encodes a hypothetical protein of  <dig> aa residues with substantial similarity to a hypothetical rice protein .

the sequence and structure of the barley pre-mir <dig> precursor show high similarity to its only known wheat orthologue pre-mir <dig> . for mrna/pri-mir <dig> transcripts, we were able to detect only the fully spliced rna, which is probably due to rapid and efficient splicing of all introns from the primary transcript . the expression level of the mrna/pri-mir <dig> was almost equal in all developmental stages tested . however, the level of the mature mir <dig> varies during development with the lowest amount in 2-week- and 68-day-old plants . this suggests the presence of the posttranscriptional mechanisms regulating the mir <dig> biogenesis. the pre-mir <dig> detected by northern blot is about  <dig> nt long and might correspond to the stem-loop structure predicted for pre-mir <dig> 

unexpectedly, we found an  <dig> nt long region which included mir1120/mir1120* and displayed almost 80% sequence similarity to the short transposon element dna/tcmar-stowaway
 <cit> . bioinformatic analysis revealed that this dna transposable element is overrepresented in the barley genome and exists in around  <dig> copies. the dna/tcmar-stowaway transposon is widespread among both monocot and dicot plants
 <cit> . our finding raises the question whether mir <dig> is a true mirna molecule or it represents a small noncoding rna such as a sirna, especially considering its size of  <dig> nucleotides.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we provide experimental evidence for selected mature mirnas and their pre- and pri-mirna structures in barley. seven of the eight analyzed mirna genes contain one or more introns, and their transcripts are the subject of complex processing events before hairpin pre-mirna species are diced out from their pri-mirna precursors. complex alternative splicing of intron-containing transcripts generated various splice isoforms, which show variations in expression level when studied across five stages of barley growth. two interesting examples of mirnas encoded within introns of noncoding genes were identified. the observed tendency to maintain the intron encoding mir156g within the transcript, and preferences in splicing the mir1126-harboring intron, may suggest the existence of special regulation of the levels of intron-derived mirnas in barley.

the discovery of developmental regulation at the level of expression of mature mirna species as well as their precursors could help explain the regulatory role of mirnas in economically important traits of the barley plant.
