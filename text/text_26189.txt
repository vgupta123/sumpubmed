BACKGROUND
in the high-throughput omics era, metabolomics is a rapidly emerging field that involves non-targeted, comprehensive analysis of known and unknown small biomolecules in a given biological sample  <cit> . while the metabolome is strongly influenced by multiple factors including heredity, diet, disease progression and response to therapy, this metabolomics approach also allows for global assessment of biological variations as a consequence of such variation in genetics or environment. changes in the metabolome can be used to elucidate changes that occur downstream of genomic or proteomic pathways. these changes can further be correlated with alterations or interventions associated with particular biochemical pathways, disease stage or environmental factors  <cit> . metabolomics is a snapshot of the metabolic status of a living system at a specific biological time point. unlike changes in the genome or proteome, metabolic fluctuations take place in a shorter time frame, therefore metabolomics may assist in early diagnosis or real time monitoring of disease  <cit> .

metabolomics promises to be a powerful systems approach for studying metabolic profiles pertinent to a variety of normal and disease states. global metabolic profiling is widely used in clinical studies to assist in early diagnosis or real time monitoring of disease  <cit> , for identifying biomarkers for neuropsychiatric  <cit> , cardiovascular  <cit>  and liver diseases  <cit> , colorectal neoplasia  <cit> , and for characterization of dysregulation in some metabolic pathways  <cit> . metabolomics based methods have also been applied in translational studies to characterize and understand genetically modified rodent models of different disease  <cit> . application of metabolomics has also been shown to be advantageous in drug development, discovery and toxicology fields  <cit> . metabolomics based methods have also been applied in translational studies to characterize and understand genetically modified rodent models of different disease  <cit> . although all these studies are data driven rather than hypothesis driven, metabolomics widen the fields in which hypothesis can be formulated and increase the potential to uncover unexpected correlations and new insights into biological processes.

cancer progression and development affects the whole metabolome. metabolomics of cancer tissues can give insight into mechanisms surrounding carcinogenesis and can help identify cancer biomarkers for establishing preventive and therapeutic treatments  <cit> . recently, several cancer metabolomics studies were carried out in a variety of cancers and used as a diagnostic or disease pattern recognition tool and as an assessment tool for different anti-cancer therapies  <cit> . this approach has great potential in clinical studies  <cit>  such as for tumor typing and biomarker discovery  <cit> .

prevention of colon cancer remains a significant public health issue that is highly associated with genetic and environmental factors such as diet composition  <cit> . evidence is emerging that diet and nutrient factors may play an important role in colorectal cancer incidence and progression  <cit> . consumption of high fat diet in combination with genetic factors leads to energy imbalances and increased risk of colon cancer  <cit> . meanwhile, it was also demonstrated that obesity and excess body weight is a major risk factor for colon cancer  <cit> . several hypotheses have emerged to explain the positive correlation between increased adiposity and colorectal cancer. some recent studies reported that obesity induced insulin resistance and chronic inflammation lead to hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia  <cit> . these have been positively associated with colon cancer risk and development  <cit> .

previous studies have investigated whether a high fat diet promotes formation and development of intestinal polyps in mice genetically predisposed to colon cancer. specifically, studies have investigated the interaction of fat content in the diet and genetic susceptibility to colon cancer in the apc

 mouse model. because mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli  was observed in over 80% of sporadic human colon cancer cases  <cit> , apc

 mice carrying a dominant mutation in the apc gene commonly serve as the mouse model of choice for the human familial adenomatous polyposis  syndrome. apc

 mice spontaneously develop multiple intestinal neoplasia  and numerous intestinal polyps, which increase in number and accelerate in development in response to a high fat diet  <cit> . also, we recently showed that high-fat dietary exposure can increase intestinal polyp formation in the apc

 model by several fold  as well as both systemic and local inflammation before the onset of overt obesity or characteristics associated with metabolic syndrome, such as increase insulin or glucose levels  <cit> .

the first phase of this study was to run untargeted metabolomics profile and association analyses to a clinical outcome on plasma samples  from wild type and apc
min/+
 mice fed either with high fat or low fat diets. acyl-coa profiles  on liver tissue samples were analyzed for all groups as well. the plasma metabolic concentrations found to be statistically different between mutation and diet factors, and statistically correlated to intestinal polyp number, was then studied by large scale functional metabolomics approaches. metabolomic pathway and network analyses reveal an association in the presence of high fat diet and apc mutation between polyp formation and plasma concentrations of metabolic compounds including those involved in the metabolic pathways of several amino-acids, hippuric acid, and nicotinamide. liver acyl-coa profiles also show changes, which may result from a combination of apc
min/+
-mediated cancer progression and high fat diet. these results illustrate that high-throughput mass spectrometry-based metabolomics combined with appropriate statistical modeling and large scale functional metabolomics approaches can be used to investigate complex environment-gene interactions, such as a combined diet-mutation effect, and their association with intestinal polyposis and tumorigenesis. understanding these important interactions in biological systems can potentially lead to the identification of new biomarkers or the development of early diagnostic tools.

/j  mice were purchased from the jackson laboratory  and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle at the wolstein research facility .

diet composition and tissue sample harvesting
the animal experimental design was as previously described in the literature in the field using the same animal model  <cit> . high- or low-saturated fat diets were as previously described  <cit> . briefly, diets were purchased from research diets and contained identical amounts of vitamins, minerals and protein. the high fat  and low fat  diets were made using hydrogenated coconut oil for the fat source. male mice were maintained on normal laboratory diet from birth till 30 days of age, then randomly placed on a high or low fat diet and maintained on this diet for 60 days until dissection and tissue harvesting. at this time , samples were collected from all mice; polyp formation  was assessed by direct observation and confirmed by histology. when present at this time, polyps were counted and measured in size and mass per animal.

sample preparations
powdered frozen liver tissue  of heptadecanoic acid and myristic acid as a retention time locker compound) was extracted with 2 ml of ch3cn/methanol  using polytron homogenizer. the slurry was centrifuged at 3800 rpm, 4°c. the supernatant was collected, dried with air before derivatization. 25 μl of plasma was spiked with 5 nmol heptadecanoic acid. metabolites were extracted with  <dig>  ml of acetonitrile/methanol . samples were centrifuged at 3800 rpm, 4°c. the supernatant was collected, dried with air before derivatization. 30 μl of 15 mg/ml of methoxylamine-hcl in dry pyridine was added to samples and incubated at 30°c for 90 minutes, followed by 70 μl of n-methyl-n-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane. the mixture was incubated at 37°c for 40 min.

gc-ms analyses
mass spectrometry
all solvents, standards and labeled internal standards and derivatization reagents for gc-ms were obtained from sigma-aldrich. gc-ms analyses were carried out on an agilent  <dig> mass spectrometer, linked to a model  <dig> gas chromatograph equipped with an autosampler, a phenomenex zb-5msi capillary column . the carrier gas was helium  and injections were 1 μl in splitless mode. the gc temperature program was: initial temperature 60°c, hold for 1 min, increase by 10°c/min to 325°c and hold 10 min. the injector temperature was set at 250°c and the transfer line at 275°c. ei source and quadrupole temperatures were set at 250°c and 150°c, respectively.

gc-ms metabolite identification and quantification
peak extraction from raw gc/ms data was carried out according to stein’s initial method  <cit>  implemented in the automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system  software developed at the national institute of standards and technology . peak identification was carried out by matching retention time and mass spectral similarity against homemade and fiehn libraries . for quantification of peak areas, the data was exported to the spectconnect server developed by styczynski et al.  <cit>  at massachusetts institute of technology . from the output of spectconnect, the only metabolites retained were those that were consistently detected in at least 80% of samples. all peak areas were normalized relative to the peak area of the internal standard heptadecanoic acid. all relative amounts then were normalized to the relative concentration of the corresponding metabolites in the control sample.

lc-ms analyses
sample preparation
acyl-coa profiles were assayed by lc-ms analyses. samples of 200–300 mg of frozen and powdered liver tissues were spiked with an internal standard of pentanoyl-coa and were extracted with methanol-h2o, 5% v/v acetic acid buffer  using a polytron homogenizer. the slurry was centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4°c. the supernatant was collected and loaded on a spe cartridge  ethyl functionalized silica gel). cartridges were washed with 9 ml of methanol-h2o, 5% v/v acetic acid buffer, acyl-coas were eluted with 9 ml of 50 mm ammonium formate in meoh-h2o , followed by 9 ml of 50 mm ammonium formate in methanol-h2o  and 9 ml of methanol. the slurry was dried with air and the residue dissolved in 100 μl of buffer a.

hplc separation
for short and medium chain acyl-coas hplc separation we used a thermo hypersil gold column  and a  <dig> × 4 mm guard column with the same packing material. the flow rate was 200 μl/min in gradient mode with the following method: the column was equilibrated with 98% mobile phase a . after sample injection, 98% mobile phase a was continued for 3 min, followed by a 23 min gradient to 90% of buffer b . the column was held at 90% b for 5 min, followed by wash by a 10 min. gradient to starting conditions . for long chain acyl-coas, the same column and flow rate were used in gradient mode with the following method: the column was equilibrated with 60% mobile phase a . after sample injection, the 60% mobile phase a was continued for 3 min, followed by a 28 min gradient to 90% of buffer b . the column was held at 90% b for 5 min, followed by a wash by a 10 min. gradient to starting conditions .

mass spectrometry
the analysis was performed with applied biosystems api  <dig> qtrap . nitrogen was used as nebulizer and desolvation gas. declustering potential was 90 v and collision energy was set to 50 ev. acyl coas were detected in multiple reaction monitoring  mode. specific mrm transitions for all acyl coas are provided in .

label-free data preprocessing
raw data acquisition and quantitative processing
all raw gc-ms spectra were processed with amdis software and compared against fiehn gc-ms library . extracted data were exported to the external server while peaks that were not consistently found in 80% of samples have been excluded from the data analysis. through all the samples,  <dig> unique metabolites were detected. out of these detected metabolites,  <dig> in total were fully annotated.

data quality control and pre-filtering
after raw data acquisition and processing, data qc and pre-filtering were performed for this study. to reduce the number of variables  at play, that is, to reduce the dimensionality of the data and error rates in subsequent inferences that are due to the lower number of samples than variables , and to simultaneously remove the variables  with the largest number of missing values without potentially inducing a severe selection bias in the presence of informative missingness , an empirical variable selection procedure was carried out. those metabolites were retained for which the observed count of missing values per metabolite is the nearest upper integer  satisfying two criteria simultaneously:  ν maximizes the difference between the overall number of remaining metabolites after selection and the overall number of missing values,  ν is less than the total sample size n minus the minimal half sample size  over all experimental groups g =  <dig> …,g . here, with an initial number of p =  <dig> metabolites, the procedure retained a final number of p =  <dig> metabolites. out of these selected metabolites,  <dig> in total were fully annotated.

missing value imputation
missing values in lc/ms data arise because of imperfect detection and alignment of peak intensities or by true absence. to account for the non-random nature of the missingness mechanism at play and its extent in this type of data , we used a probability model adapted from wang et al. <cit>  which describes ‘artifactual missing events’. this model makes inferences on the missing values of one sample based on the information from other ‘similar’ samples . it substitutes a missing measurement of intensity with its expected value of the true intensity given that it is unobservable. remaining missing values represent truly absent metabolites in the samples and are typically imputed by taking an estimate of the background noise .

transformation of features
to help remove sources of systematic variation in the measured intensities  and to ensure that the usual assumption of normality is met for statistical inferences, we first applied a log-transformation on the variables . in addition, since the homoscedasticity assumption in multi-group designs is also required, e.g. in anova models, we also applied our recently developed ‘joint adaptive mean-variance regularization’ procedure as described in  <cit>  now available as an r package called “mvr”  <cit> . briefly, the joint adaptive regularization procedure simultaneously overcomes the lack of degrees of freedom and the variance-mean dependence issue in this type of dataset where the number of variables hugely dominates the number of sample  <cit> . the procedure stabilizes the variance and normalizes the concentration values, both of which are required for preprocessing high-dimensional data and making inferences. although, the procedure is designed to stabilize the variance across variables , we observed in our methodology article  <cit>  that it also translates into good variance stabilization effect across sample groups in a multi-group design, as is the case in this study. note that intensity levels on this transformed scale are on the entire real domain, so they are not necessary positive.

experimental design
experimental units, groups, factors and sample size
in this experimental design three factors are at play:  the diet  vs. low fat ), denoted df,  the genotype  vs. mutant ), denoted gf, and  the source of tissue  vs. liver ), denoted tf, representing the variable over which repeated measures are made within each experimental unit. the experimental units under study are the n =  <dig> individual mice or biological replicate. samples were assumed to be independent and randomly sampled from the entire population. further, samples were randomized across the design  and balanced for each combination of diet by genotype by source of tissue experimental group  to have an equal number of biological replicates per experimental group . the group sample sizes used in this study were consistent with other metabolomics studies carried out in the same mouse model . a common reference sample was used to normalize mass spectrometry readouts. no technical replicates were performed. no sample pooling was done. observations were repeated with the same biological replicate for each tissue. in sum, this is a factorial arrangement of treatments  laid out on a balanced completely randomized design  with repeated measures on another treatment  amounting to a total of 2n =  <dig> observations .

statistical analyses
analysis of variance of acyl-coa concentrations profiles of liver samples
the standard error of the means were computed for all absolute or relative concentration means per experimental group . two-sample two-sided t-test p-values, or multi-group anova p-values, were computed for assessing the significance of difference between two groups, or between a group mean and the overall mean across the groups under the assumption of normality and homoscedasticity of concentration levels within each group.

test of independence/association
we carried out a pearson’s chi-square test of independence to assess the independence between the two categorical factors  of the experimental design. basically, we tested the distribution of counts in a 2-by- <dig> contingency table to determine whether there were nonrandom associations between two categorical factors.

principal component analysis of plasma samples
potential groups and outliers among the samples were checked by a principal component analysis   <cit> . a pca scatterplot of samples  was formed by plotting the plasma samples in the first two coordinate axes  of the pc space. the scoreplot represents the scores that each sample has on the pcs. points that have similar scores in the pc space cluster together and correspond to samples behaving similarly.

statistical modeling and inference of differential metabolite concentrations in plasma samples
a standard analysis method in modeling high dimensional data is to fit the same statistical model individually to each variable  and test for the contrast or effect of interest using the hypothesis testing framework. a drawback of this univariate approach is that the correlation structure or dependence between the variables is ignored. however, thanks to the parallel nature of the high-throughput data, some compensating possibilities exist by borrowing information across variables, resulting in more stable variance estimates, which in turn assist in inference about each variable individually. statistical modeling was performed using a linear model of analysis of variance , fitted univariately to each individual variable  for the plasma samples. if we let y
ij
 be the intensity signal on the transformed scale of the jth variable  and ith unit  using the appropriate transformation mentioned above  <cit> , a linear anova model for each individual metabolite j is fitted as follows:

 yij=μj+xijtβj+ϵij

reports for label-free analysis in plasma samples
in this experimental design, contrasts were built for each of the fixed effects of interest, and coefficients were estimated accordingly. variables were ranked in order of evidence of differential concentration. corresponding p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using a recent extension of the standard benjamini-hochberg procedure, which controls the expected false discovery rate   <cit> . this error rate, called the positive fdr   <cit> , results in a procedure that is less conservative than the fdr.  report top-ranked metabolites  from the model fit for each effect of interest. each table consists in columns with the following information: the estimated log2-fold change  or m log-ratio for individual metabolite across effect or contrast of interest. it represents a log2-fc ) between two experimental conditions in the case of a main effect and to a difference in log2-fc in the case of an interaction effect. an estimated average log2-fold change of -  <dig> and +  <dig> correspond to a ½- and 2-fold change respectively. moderated t- and b- statistics represent different measures of statistical significance. the moderated t-statistic corresponds to the usual t-statistic except that information has been borrowed across variables , while the b-statistic is the empirical bayes log <dig> of the posterior odds that the metabolite is differentially expressed. finally raw and adjusted p-values are listed. note that in every list all the metabolites are ranked by adjusted p-value and then by b-statistic.

modeling polyp counts
to analyze how experimental factors  control the relationship between polyp counts and individual plasma metabolite concentrations, we modeled the polyp counts univariately for each variable  using a zero-inflated negative-binomial regression model. this provides a way to account for the excess zeros in addition to allowing for overdispersion simultaneously  <cit> . zero-inflated models are preferable to their classical generalized linear model  counterparts   <cit>  to model these two situations typically occurring in biomedical sciences count data. briefly, zero-inflated models are two-component mixture models combining  a zero-inflated count probability distribution , employed for zero counts, with  a non-zero count probability distribution , employed for positive counts. zero-inflated models allow distinct regressors for each component model. formally, if we denote by c
ij
 the observed polyps count for the ith unit  and jth variable , the probability distribution of c
ij
 counts for each individual metabolite j can be written as:

 prcij=cij|xij,zij=πiji0cij+1−πijfcij|xij 

where i{0}  denotes the indicator function at  <dig>  πij=πzijtγj denotes the unobserved probability of belonging to the zero-inflated count component, modelled by a binomial glm model πzijtγj=expzijtγj using the canonical log link function, and where the vectors of regressors x

implementations, algorithms and softwares
whenever available, implementations and algorithms of our methods are freely available from the cran consortium  at http://cran.r-project.org/. all other r codes written in our group can be provided upon request. for linear modeling and supervised inferences, we used the package “limma”  <cit> . for count data modeling, we used the package “pscl”  <cit> . finally, for the control of the positive fdr, we used the package “qvalue”  <cit> .

functional metabolomics analyses
significantly altered metabolites with pfdr-adjusted p-values ≤  <dig>  outputted from the statistical model were selected for functional metabolomics analyses. metabolite identifiers with their corresponding raw and pfdr-adjusted p-values were up-loaded onto the ingenuity pathway analysis application for biological functions, canonical metabolomics pathways, and interaction network analyses . whenever a multiple-testing correction was required to assess significance e.g. of function, pathway, or network enrichment, we report adjusted p-values using the benjamini-hochberg  method  <cit> , which is the only error-rate control-procedure available for that matter in ipa at this time.

canonical metabolomics pathways
for the computation of enrichment p-values, we used the ipa metabolomics knowledge base as our reference database set, i.e. the universe of all metabolomics entities. significance of each individual pathway was measured in two ways:  a ratio  of the number of selected molecules mapping a selected pathway that meets a cutoff criterion, divided by the total number of molecules that exist in this canonical pathway.  a right-tailed fisher exact test p-value for the probability under the null hypothesis that the association between those metabolites found in a given pathway of our list with all those constitutive of the corresponding canonical metabolomics pathway is explained by chance alone . the smaller the p-value, the less likely it is that the association is random and the more significant the association. note that the right-tailed fisher’s exact test only assesses over-represented pathways, that is, those that have more molecules found than would be expected by chance alone.

metabolomics network analysis
significant metabolites were mapped in ipa to the global molecular network that was developed from the ingenuity knowledge base. networks for these metabolites were algorithmically generated based on their connectivity. a score equal to the negative log of the p-value of the right-tailed fisher’s exact test was assigned for each network. this score takes into account the number of eligible metabolites in our dataset and the size of the network to calculate the fit between each network and the metabolites in the dataset.

cytoscape
metabolomic networks were also generated using cytoscape version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . cytoscape allows users to build and analyze networks of genes and compounds, identify enriched pathways from expression profiling data, and visualize changes in gene expression and/or compound concentration. two plug-in apps were used for metabolic analyses directly from mass spectrometry data:  metscape  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  that traces connections between metabolites, reactions and genes, and provides a bioinformatics framework for the visualization and interpretation of metabolomics data;  metdisease  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  that allows users to annotate a metabolic network with mesh disease terms, explore related diseases within a network, and link to pubmed references corresponding to any node and selection network. metscape uses an internal relational database stored at ncibi to integrate metabolic compounds, reactions and pathway information from kegg, ehmn, or entrez gene ids. metdisease supports both kegg ids and pubchem ids. metscape and metdisease were used in addition to ingenuity pathway analysis to interpret results of canonical pathways found by ipa.

overlap/enrichment analyses
to assess the statistical significance of overlap/intersection of a set of metabolic compounds  with another set of compounds , we tested the null hypothesis that the two sets of compounds are unrelated i.e. that any intersection is due to chance alone . using the hypergeometric distribution as the null distribution, and letting x be the random variable of the observed number of metabolic compounds in common between the two sets, for a given number y of compounds in the first set, l compounds in the second set, and a total of n compounds/molecules from the knowledge database that are associated with the analysis , the probability of observing x = x overlapping compounds under the null is given by:

 px=x|y,n,l=yxn−yl−xnl 

this rejection probability gives the p-value of overlap/intersection, based on the assumed null probability distribution.

RESULTS
grouping of plasma samples
to study global metabolic differences associated with apc
min/+
 mutation and/or different diets we first used an unsupervised statistical approach. principal component analysis  is a visualization and dimension reduction technique that allows detection of any groups or outliers in the data. the pca was carried out in the plasma samples. principal components  derived from the analysis represent rotated coordinate axes pointing to directions of the predictor space  where the spread of the data  is the largest, allowing a better visualization of groups or outliers in the samples . pca scree plots determine the order and the number of principal components  accounting for the largest amount of variance in the data . here, a minimum of  <dig> pc’s was enough to explain most of the cumulative percentage of explained variance for the plasma samples . the corresponding loading plots  ranks the respective contribution of all the variables  to each pc.

based on the previous analysis of explained variance, the first two pcs were retained for groups and outliers detection among the samples. the biplot in figure  <dig> is the pca analysis of the plasma samples. it shows a complete separation between all four experimental groups . notice, however, how the distance between mutant vs. wild-type sample groups increases from low-fat diet to high fat diet treatments. similarly, notice how the distance between high fat diet vs. low-fat diet sample groups increases from wild-type to mutant treatments. overall, this indicates a potential synergistic interaction effect between the diet and genotype factors in plasma metabolite concentration profiles, i.e. that a high fat diet tends to enhance metabolic differences associated with apc
min/+
 mutation, or vice-versa, i.e. that a apc
min/+
 mutation tends to enhance metabolic differences associated with a high fat diet. essentially, this means that a single metabolic process may be affected by a combined treatment of a specific diet and genotype.

evaluation of treatments on metabolite concentration profiles in plasma
to profile the plasma metabolite concentrations across the experimental groups and determine their differential concentrations between experimental groups, we fitted the same linear mixed-effect model of analysis of variance univariately to each individual metabolite as described in the ‘methods’ section. in this experimental design, the primary contrasts of interest are the genotype and diet main effects, as well as their genotype by diet interaction effect. the latter, although harder to interpret, is actually of most interest since this evaluates how a change in genotype  affects a metabolite concentration and how this varies by type of diet ; or alternatively, how a change of diet  affects a metabolite concentration and how this varies by genotype . metabolites were ranked by significance across comparisons. adjusted p-values for multiple testing  and a positive pfdr threshold cutoff of up to 5% were used to determine significance according to our criteria for confirmation of metabolite identification as described in the ‘methods’ section . note that, with the sizes of the lists  of significant tests given below, a pfdr threshold cutoff of 5% means that no more than  <dig> to  <dig> metabolites, depending on the corresponding effect, are expected to be falsely called significant. the false discovery rate  theory, however, does not allow us to determine which metabolites are falsely included in each of these lists, but only their proportions  <cit> .

overall, a significant number of plasma metabolite concentrations changed by effect. these represent metabolites for which the concentration is sensitive to apc
min/+
 mutation, fat diet treatment or an interaction between the two. venn diagrams summarize the counts of significant up- and down-regulated plasma metabolites. in the two main effects of interest,  <dig> plasma metabolites  were found regulated between the genotype groups; and  <dig> plasma metabolites  between the diet groups .

further, to describe how the genotype effect  on a plasma metabolite concentration varies by the diet , or vice-versa, we focused on the genotype by diet interaction effect. in this interaction effect,  <dig> plasma metabolites  were found differentially regulated. this genotype by diet interaction effect result is consistent with observations made for their individual main effects as the majority of metabolites identified as significant in the interaction effect were also found synergistically and/or antagonistically changed for these two factors individually. this is also consistent with the pca interpretation . this result is summarized in a venn diagram  and the list is provided in additional file 7: table s <dig> 

to visually describe the metabolites with significant regulation, it is convenient to visualize them in a so-called volcano plot. . overall, the lists of plasma regulated metabolites reveals the metabolomics variations resulting from the individual or combined effects of a mutation in the apc gene and/or a high-fat diet. in the next section, we further examined how these metabolomics variations correlate to a clinical outcome of interest, namely the intestinal polyp counts.

independence between genotype and diet factors
table  <dig> shows total polyp counts as measured in the intestine at animal sacrifice. on the one hand, wild-type animals do not apparently develop any polyps at all with either diet. this represents a classical situation of artificial over-inflation of zeros in count data analysis in the presence of relatively low counts and sample sizes. on the other hand, all apc
min/+
 mice show polyps growth, and high fat diet promotes polyps development .

we tested the association/dependence of the two main factors  and their contribution to polyp counts . the null hypothesis that is to be tested for comparing two categorical factors in a 2-by- <dig> contingency table is:

 h0:thegenotypefactorisindependentofthedietfactor. 

the χ2-test with one degree of freedom  yielded χ12≫ <dig> with a p-value <  <dig>  e- <dig>  therefore, we would reject the null hypothesis of independence, i.e. there is strong evidence of association of polyp counts with specific groups of diet by genotype factors.

relationship between polyp counts and metabolite profiles in plasma
a mere comparison of plasma metabolite levels between experimental groups cannot answer the causality question as to whether the observed differences arise from or contribute to polyposis and tumorigenesis. typically, this question can only be addressed with respect to the controlled experimental variables of our design, namely the genotype and diet factors. if, however, one models the relationship between the polyp counts simultaneously with the plasma metabolite levels and the controlled experimental variables, one can analyze how changes in the genotype and diet factor levels modify this relationship and determine what the metabolite associated with these changes are.

for each metabolite, we fit a zero-inflated generalized linear model  of polyp counts with respect to the categorical variables of the design matrix  and each univariate continuous measurement of metabolite concentration . with the restriction that this linear model will, by definition, only explore linear relationships, this allows modeling the  correlation between polyp counts and each metabolite concentration profile for each combination of genotype and diet factor levels. specifically, the primary combination of interest in this experimental design is the two-way interaction between genotype and diet since this represents how polyp count varies by metabolite concentration and how this relationship is influenced by the apc genotype  and diet content . individual p-values of the coefficient of interest were reported for each individual model . adjusted p-values represent a positive fdr . with a maximum fdr of 5%, we found as many as  <dig> plasma metabolites having a significant correlation with polyp count in association with an interaction effect . many of the plasma metabolites listed are still uncharacterized or un-annotated . this list reflects how deeply the combination of apc
min/+
 mutation and high fat diets is associated with the plasma metabolome and translates into intestinal polyps formation. they are essential to further determine the underlying metabolomics pathways of the host and the role of environmental factors in relation to the progression of the disease. these results are further analyzed and discussed.

raw p-values from the generalized linear model are reported with pfdr-adjusted p-values as described in the ‘methods’ section. metabolites with pfdr ≤  <dig>  are shown and ranked by pfdr-adjusted or equivalently by raw p-values. accession numbers from the human metabolome database accession , the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  databases, and chemical abstract service  are provided. only annotated compounds of the list of significant compounds are shown here. the full list with hyperlinked accession numbers is provided in .

as an illustration of the above association and influence of controlled experimental variables, we show correlation and regression results between plasma metabolite levels and polyp counts by combination of genotype and diet factor levels for the hippuric acid, the pyrophosphate and nicotinamide metabolic pathways  and the uptake of six amino acids . consistent with previous results, note immediately how the mutant - high fat diet samples specifically cluster in the region of the plot of higher polyp counts . further, note also for the same experimental group of samples the positive  or negative  correlation of polyp counts with plasma metabolite levels. the plot also shows the comparisons of correlation coefficients and determination coefficients observed in each of the combination of genotype and diet factors levels . these results are further analyzed and discussed.

functional analyses in plasma
plasma metabolites correlated with intestinal polyps and associated with a genotype by diet interaction effect  were subjected to functional metabolomics annotations analyses. for reasons explained above, this list of identified metabolites is essential to the understanding of the underlying metabolomics pathways related to the progression of intestinal tumorigenesis and how genetic and environment factors affect it.

biological functions, canonical metabolomics pathways and metabolomics interaction networks analyses were first carried out by ingenuity pathway analyses . remarkably, results show that among the complete list of significant canonical biological functions/diseases found by ipa, the top two ones are annotated as : “cancer” and “gastrointestinal disease” ). also, among the lists of significant ipa canonical metabolomics pathways, the “trna charging” pathway is the most significant ).

integrating molecular networks from high-throughput data is often sought as a powerful means to visualize and model functional interactions in a system of molecular components. to further elucidate the biological meaning of the above “trna charging” canonical pathway as well as the canonical function/disease “cancer and gastrointestinal disease” found by ipa, metscape genes-metabolites metabolic networks were built using their corresponding metabolic compounds. in each network view, connections between metabolites and genes were drawn to form a unified conceptual network as described in the methods section. genes-metabolites networks corresponding to the “trna charging” canonical pathway and to the “cancer and gastrointestinal disease” canonical disease revealed key ‘hub’ compounds also present in our list of interest ; such as, respectively, pyrophosphate, in relation to numerous genes of the rna polymerases family , and nicotinamide, in relation to numerous genes of the poly polymerases  families, as well as sirt- <dig> histone deacetylase . these findings are further discussed. an important property of networks or graphs is related to the node connectivity or node degree, i.e. the number of connections a node has to other nodes. in non-random networks the degree distribution or probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network follows a scale-free power law rather than a binomial distribution  <cit> . this so-called ‘scale-free’ connectivity property is conjectured to be present in most common networks such as biological, genetic, metabolic, social networks and the internet. in any kind of network, the presence of hierarchical structures such as ‘hubs’ and the associated overall high level node connectivity  are hallmarks of non-randomness. here, the figure shows this ‘hub’ feature in at least two prominent metabolite compounds of interest  as well as the overall high level of node degree in both genes-metabolites networks.

we further analyzed the function of plasma metabolites correlated with intestinal polyps and associated with a genotype by diet interaction effect  by building ipa interaction metabolomics networks. among the list of significant interaction metabolomics networks found by ipa , the most significant one is canonically referred to as “increased levels of albumin, cellular growth and proliferation, organismal development” . to add functional description to this biological network, we overlaid the information of the top two biological functions/diseases found by ipa, namely “cancer” and “gastrointestinal disease”. notice the extent of overlap of this metabolomics interaction network with the disease set . the corresponding intersection p-value  was computed as described in the methods section , which is statistically highly significant at the α =  <dig>  significance level, indicating that the two sets of compounds are  truly intersecting. therefore, in addition to showing the specific metabolites  that have a genotype by diet interaction effect associated with polyp counts, this biological network shows the extent of overlap between these metabolites and the disease information, i.e. their relevance to the disease process. furthermore, the biological network also shows the involvement of the hippuric acid metabolic pathway , and consequently its relevance to the “cancer and gastrointestinal disease” canonical function/disease mentioned above. a biological model for this finding is proposed and further discussed.

finally, to gain insight into the underlying metabolic and genetic networks involving the plasma metabolites correlated with intestinal polyps and associated with a genotype by diet interaction effect , we subjected these metabolites to integrated metscape-metdisease disease annotation analyses as described in the methods section. mesh terms corresponding to “gastrointestinal neoplasms” and “gastrointestinal disease” were matched to a metabolites-only network  or a genes-metabolites network . the overlap between the set of metabolic compounds and their annotation to the disease terms is striking. in the former case, a total of  <dig> matching nodes were found out of a total of  <dig> metabolic compounds nodes . the corresponding overlapping p-value was computed here with parameters x =  <dig>  y =  <dig> , l =  <dig>  and n =  <dig> . the resulting p-value  that is below the computer lower bound of floating-point representation let us draw two conclusions. first, the metabolomics signature of “gastrointestinal neoplasms” and “gastrointestinal disease” is certainly present in the list of metabolic compounds of interest . second, and more importantly, the metabolic network views provided in  are useful representations of the metabolite-metabolite interactions sub-networks and of the metabolite-genes workflows that underlie the progression of intestinal polyposis or tumorigenesis and how genetic and environment factors affect it. further, the figure shows hierarchical structures such as ‘hubs’ for many metabolite compounds of interest. this feature and the overall high level of node degree in both networks  are hallmarks of organized non-random networks.

acyl-coa profiles in liver
cancer progression is usually associated with profound changes in energy metabolism since tumor cells stimulate growth through increased glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation pathways  <cit> . because acyl-coas represent important intermediates of lipid metabolism that are affected in cancer  <cit> , we report the concentrations of both long-chain as well as short/medium-chain acyl-coas from the liver tissue. mean absolute concentrations  were normalized per gram of wet liver tissue  . relative concentrations were calculated with respect to acyl-coas concentrations in apc wild-type low fat  animals .

mean concentrations were calculated per experimental group , normalized per gram of wet liver tissue  and computed for the following long-chain acyl-coas: c12-coa, c14-coa, c16-coa, c18-coa, c16:oh-coa, c16:1-coa, c18:1-coa, c18:2-coa, c20:4-coa, c22:6-coa. standard error of the means are indicated. wt-lf, wt-hf, mu-lf, and mu-hf stand respectively for the following combination of treatments: apc wild-type - low fat diet, apc wild-type - high fat diet, apc mutant - low fat diet, apc mutant - high fat diet.

long-chain acyl-coas
total content of long chain acyl-coas data show that the effect of high fat feeding is associated with a very significant fold change between mu-hf and mu-lf groups , while no significant difference is observed between wt-hf and wt-lf  . overall, this profile underscores the synergistic  effect of the apc
min/+
 mutation with a high fat diet in the total content of long chain acyl-coas.

first, looking further into individual long chain acyl-coas, note that the effect of high fat feeding is associated with an increase of specific long chain acyl-coas contents, namely c12-coas and to a lower extent c14-coas, in both apc genotype backgrounds: we report in apc wild-type and apc
min/+
 mutant animals, both fed with high fat, a significant fold change increase of c12-coas content as compared to all other long chain acyl-coas contents  . second, note the remarkable fold change increase of c12-coas content upon high fat feeding in apc
min/+
 mutant animals , which is less pronounced in apc wild-type animals  . the latter profile also underscores the synergistic  effect of the apc
min/+
 mutation with a high fat diet in the content of c12-coas.

short and medium-chain acyl-coas
we found a very significant fold change increase of free acyl-coas contents in the mu-hf group as compared to the other three experimental groups , underlying a strong synergistic  effect of apc
min/+
 mutation with a high fat diet on these compound levels . likewise, note the synergistic  effects of apc
min/+
 mutation and high fat diet in the increase of propionyl-coa  and pentanoyl-coa  levels, indicating that the apc
min/+
 mutation and high fat diet act both alone and in concert on these compound levels . finally, note the increasing  effect of high fat diet on octanoyl-coa levels  and the decreasing  effect of apc
min/+
 mutation in bhb-coa levels  .

acyl-coa/free-coa ratios
the / ratio usually reflects energy demand of the tissue. this ratio alters in response to change in energy state of a system. figure  <dig> shows the / ratios for all four groups. effects of increased availability of free fatty acids on β-oxidation rates and on gene expression of β-oxidation enzymes have already been studied by others  <cit> . these studies illustrate that high levels of dietary fatty acids induce mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation in liver and thus decrease the / ratio. our findings are compatible with those studies and show a significant decrease in the / ratio  for the mu-hf group . this indicates a synergistic effect of the apc
min/+
 mutation with a high fat diet on the relative abundance of acyl-coas to free-coas.

discussion
our study demonstrates that global gc-ms-based plasma metabolomics and targeted lc-ms/ms-based liver metabolite profiling can be combined with clinical observations to investigate diet interventions and genetic susceptibility to intestinal cancer. our results underscore the high potential of metabolomics profiling in pattern recognition and characterization of potential pathways of intestinal cancer. metabolites from different pathways have been identified including tca cycle intermediates, amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids and various acyl-coas. unsupervised and supervised statistical procedures allowed us to study plasma metabolic alterations between wild type and genetically predisposed mice to intestinal cancer  under diet intervention. as a part of our study, we were able to correlate an important clinical outcome of intestinal cancer to plasma metabolic profiles in an animal model genetically predisposed to intestinal cancer, and determine how this is modified by a change of diet. in our experiment, this correlation characterizes how polyp counts in the small intestine vary by metabolite concentration, levels of the genotype factor , and levels of the diet factor . overall, plasma metabolomics concentration profile results indicate that that high-fat diet significantly enhances some of the metabolic perturbations that are associated with apc

 mutation and small intestine tumor development.

increase in some of plasma amino acids levels has been observed. since cancer cells are high proliferation cells and require free amino acids as an energy source  <cit>  or as building blocks for metabolites  <cit> , presumably elevated plasma amino acids levels reflect malignant tissues need for bloodstream amino acid supplies. regarding the role of methionine, there are controversial studies showing either a positive or negative effect of methionine on different types of cancer in various tissues  <cit> . the methionine-mediated dna methylation along with folate and homocysteine  hypomethylation could increase the risk of cancer  <cit> .

while poly polymerase- <dig>  has well-described functions in the regulation of chromatin structure, transcription and genomic integrity, recent evidences point to a role in transcriptional regulation in the context of human malignancy . specifically, parp- <dig> may play an important role in carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer and recent findings have raised the possibility of using parp inhibitor therapy in colorectal cancers clinical trials . the observed negative correlation between nicotinamide concentration levels and polyp numbers , along with the numerous known relations of nicotinamide to genes of the parp family that were revealed in our data , suggest a possible antagonist effect of nicotinamide compound levels on polyp formation and on promotion of intestinal cancer via inhibition of parp activity. alternatively, the reduction of nicotinamide concentration could reflect its consumption as substrate for nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase  to synthesize nicotinamide phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate as a key precursor for synthesis of nad+ <cit> . nad+ is required to support tumor growth, both as substrate for parp  <cit>  and for function of sirt <dig>  an nad+ dependent deacetylase whose activity is associated with deacetylation of p <dig>  consequently leading to progressive tumor growth  <cit> . the potential consumption of nicotinamide to support nad+ synthesis and increased activity of parp and/or sirt <dig> indicates this pathway, which was identified in our studies, is a potentially important target for chemotherapy.

the correlation between plasma hippuric acid  levels and polyp numbers could be a result of different rates of benzoate uptake, possibly through polyps. berger et al. reported in their study that benzoic acid is absorbed from the intestine by sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporters , followed by benzoyl-glycine production in liver from benzoic acid through activation of benzoate to benzoyl coa  <cit> . slc5a <dig> and slc5a <dig> transporters mediate uptake of a variety of monocarboxylates including benzoic acid and show different concentration profiles in normal vs. cancer tissues  <cit> . consequently, we interpret the increase in plasma hippurate concentration as reflecting a stimulation of benzoate uptake from the intestine, probably linked to the monocarboxylate transporter associated with intestinal polyps .

a key question relates to the causality of our findings with intestine polyp formation. should some of the plasma metabolite levels found in animal fed with high fat diet be considered, at least in part, a cause or a consequence of the formation of these polyps? further studies are warranted to determine whether the increase of plasma metabolites levels that is observed in the combination of high-fat diet with apc mutation and for which there is a significant correlation with intestinal polyp formation , could be interpreted as a consequence of tumor formation and not a cause. in some cases, such as hippurate metabolism, this interpretation would be consistent with our proposed biological model for that compound  and support our recent results in the same apc
min/+
 mouse model of intestinal neoplasia in that high-saturated fat-diets increase polyp development and formation  <cit> . alternatively, a possibility that needs to be considered stems from recent studies showing that intestinal and circulating metabolites may be significantly altered by the intestinal microbiome to change the composition and available energy content of ingested nutrients as well as to generate factors which stimulate inflammation, cardiovascular disease and cancer  <cit> .

to investigate deregulations in lipid metabolism, which are critical for energy homeostasis, we have measured liver acyl-coa profiles. high fat diet intervention stimulates fatty acid metabolism by increasing the availability of free fatty acids that might lead to the increase in β-oxidation rates. on the other hand, apart from the nutrition intervention, the fatty acid oxidation pathway is up-regulated in cancer cells since these cells have high proliferation rates and increased energy consumption. our findings show a decrease of / ratio and it presumably reflects up-regulation in β-oxidation pathway as a result of a combination of apc

-mediated cancer progression and high fat diet.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that mass spectrometry-based cancer metabolomics, when used in an appropriate experimental design, can give important insights into genotype characterization and diet intervention effects, and their association with intestinal polyposis and tumorigenesis. although high-throughput mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data feature relative concentrations , these studies show that high-throughput metabolomics combined with appropriate statistical modeling and large scale functional approaches can be used to monitor and infer changes and interactions in the metabolome and genome of the host under controlled experimental conditions. further these studies demonstrate the impact of diet on metabolic pathways and its relation to intestinal cancer progression. based on our results, metabolic signatures of polyposis intestinal carcinoma have been identified, such as those involving nicotinamide and hippuric acid metabolic pathways, which may serve as a useful targets for the development of therapeutic interventions.
