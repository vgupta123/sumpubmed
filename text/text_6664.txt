BACKGROUND
during the last two decades, genome sequencing efforts are providing us with complete genome sequences from many organisms . the generated sequence databases are fundamental tools used by researchers in almost every field of modern biology. in addition they provide the basis for powerful technologies to quantitatively analyze the gene expression profile on the mrna-level using dna microarrays  <cit> . however, it has to be considered that mrna molecules are only intermediate products towards the production of functional proteins and that protein abundance is not necessarily reflected by the amount of the corresponding mrna transcript  <cit> . the concentration of individual proteins at the cellular level or in biological fluids mainly depends on four completely different processes:  protein synthesis,  protein processing,  protein secretion and  protein degradation. as a consequence, systematic quantitative predictions of protein populations are impossible to deduce from genomic or transcriptional data. moreover, proteins frequently undergo post-translational modifications  crucial for their function, activity, and stability and they often play major roles in regulatory networks  <cit> . comprehensive datasets addressing the protein level, therefore, are indispensable for a functional and biochemical characterization of both cells and organisms. the field of high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins using systematic approaches is commonly referred to as proteomics. recent developments in mass spectrometry have revolutionized the field and dramatically increased the sensitivity of protein identification compared to classical techniques like edman sequencing. as a consequence, large proteome investigations have been established covering, e.g., human plasma  <cit> , human brain  <cit>  and human liver  <cit>  as well as model organisms such as caenorhabditis elegans  <cit>  and drosophila melanogaster  <cit> .

this, in turn, has led to the realization that proteomics is not only essential to our understanding of cell function, but in addition is a validation tool for genes predicted in genome annotation projects. recently published results demonstrate that peptide mass spectrometry complements gene annotation in drosophila  <cit>  and humans  <cit> .

although a multitude of whole-genome sequencing projects ranging from microbial  to vertebrate genomes  <cit>  have been initiated in the last decade, no complete genome sequence is available for crustaceans, a species-rich taxa with additional high economical impact.

hence, the daphnia genomics consortium  was founded in  <dig> to develop the waterflea daphnia, a small planktonic crustacean, as a further model system in genomics, but with the added advantage of being able to interpret the results in the context of natural ecological challenges. even though the ecology and ecotoxicology of daphnia has been well studied, because they are a major link between limnetic primary production and higher trophic levels, less work has been done on the genetics of this organism. nevertheless, their clonal reproduction, short generation times, and their transparent body also make them well suited for experimental molecular research.

in this special series of papers published in bmc journals, the first description of the daphnia pulex draft genome sequence  is described. besides investigation on the dna and mrna level, the availability of the daphnia genome sequence opens the door to investigate the proteome of this fascinating species. in this article we present the generation of a first data-set consisting of  <dig>  peptide tandem-mass-spectra derived from daphnia pulex. in order to demonstrate the impact of the daphnia genome sequence on proteomics based studies we compared the number of identified proteins using the daphnia protein database with the number of identifications obtained by searching against the swiss-prot and the drosophila melanogaster protein database . to validate the utility of the daphnia pulex genome for research on different daphnia species, additional  <dig>  peptide tandem-mass-spectra derived from daphnia longicephala were generated and evaluated. in addition, the peptides identified in our approach provide the first experimental evidence for the translation of a broad variety of predicted coding regions within the daphnia genome.

RESULTS
sample preparation
to generate protein lysates suitable for sds gel electrophoresis, pools of about  <dig> waterfleas  were homogenated. the protein concentration of the obtained lysates  was  <dig>  mg/ml for daphnia pulex and  <dig>  mg/ml for daphnia longicephala corresponding to a total protein yield of  <dig> μg and  <dig> μg per daphniid, respectively.

sds-gel pre-fractionation of daphnia proteins
 <dig> μg of total protein from either daphnia pulex or daphnia longicephala, was separated by sds-gel electrophoresis. to evaluate the quality of the electrophoretic separation, the gels were stained with coomassie. an image of sds-gels derived from both daphnia species is shown in fig.  <dig>  both samples showed sharp distinct bands, indicating that the performed electrophoreses had good separation strengths. to generate  <dig> protein fractions of each sample, the corresponding gel lanes were cut into  <dig> pieces as outlined in fig.  <dig>  to get samples suitable for lc-ms/ms, each gel slice was subjected to the in-gel digestion procedure described in the methods chapter.

lc-ms/ms analysis of daphnia pulex proteins
for the qualitative analysis of the daphnia pulex proteome, two samples were fractionized by sds-gel electrophoresis  and subjected to lc-ms/ms analysis. each of the  <dig> gel fractions was separated with one-dimensional reversed phase  liquid chromatography  and a combination of strong cation-exchange  with rp chromatography  respectively. from the 1d-lc-ms/ms runs  <dig>  spectra could be collected and from the 2d-lc-ms/ms runs  <dig>  spectra were acquired. all ms/ms spectra were searched against the non-redundant filtered models database of daphnia v <dig>  gene builds   and evaluated using the peptideprophet software. applying a false discovery rate of = 1%,  <dig> ms/ms spectra could be assigned to peptides within the daphnia database, of which  <dig> were unique. the assignment of peptides to proteins using the proteinprophet algorithm led to the identification of  <dig> proteins with the 1d-lc-ms/ms approach and  <dig> proteins with the 2d-lc-ms/ms startegy . as shown in fig.  <dig>  all except seven proteins identified in the 1d-lc approach could be found in the 2d-lc-ms/ms dataset as well. further analysis of the data revealed that a significant fraction of proteins could be identified in more than one gel slice, as summarized in fig.  <dig>  the overall list of identified proteins and peptides is available as additional file  <dig> 

ontology analysis of the identified proteins
to analyze the ontology of the identified daphnia pulex proteins the entries of the filtered models database were blastp-searched  in the swiss-prot database  <cit> . we chose the swiss-prot database because of its high level of annotation, including entries about protein function, posttranslational modifications as well as a direct link to the gene ontology  databases  <cit> . from the  <dig> sequences derived from the filtered models database,  <dig> homologue  protein sequences could be found. the corresponding protein swiss-prot ids were subjected to ontology analysis using the pandora server . the results of this ontology analysis are shown in fig.  <dig>  in the "cellular component" go database only  <dig> proteins of the  <dig> proteins were listed. their classification analysis revealed that the majority  are of intracellular origin and the fraction of the particularly interesting class of membrane proteins comprises 27%. the "molecular function" go revealed  <dig> proteins the majority of which were classified as proteins with catalytic activity. from these fractions  <dig> were enzymes from which  <dig> could be classified as hydrolases,  <dig> as oxyreductases,  <dig> as transferases and  <dig> as lyases.  <dig> proteins could be classified as enzyme inhibitors. using the "biological process" database  <dig> proteins could be classified from which  <dig> were associated with metabolism,  <dig> with cell growth and/or maintenance,  <dig> with cell communication,  <dig> with response to external stimulus and  <dig> with developmental processes.

searches of ms/ms data in the swiss-prot and drosophila melanogaster protein database
to investigate the benefit of the daphnia pulex filtered models database on the ms based identification of daphnia proteins, cross-species identification, as suggested by several authors  <cit> , was performed using the metazoa subset of the swiss-prot database  and the drosophila melanogaster database from flybase . using the ms/ms spectra obtained with the 2d-lc-ms/ms runs of the daphnia pulex sample,  <dig> daphnia proteins could be identified with the drosophila database and  <dig> with the swiss-prot database with a false-positive identification threshold of = 1%.

lc-ms/ms analysis of daphnia longicephala proteins
to determine the suitability of the non-redundant filtered models database of putative daphnia pulex proteins for the ms-based identification of proteins from other daphnia subgenera, a daphnia longicephala protein lysate was generated.  which could be assigned to  <dig> daphnia longicephala proteins . as shown in fig.  <dig>   <dig> of these proteins could exclusively be identified in daphnia longicephala samples but not in daphnia pulex samples.

discussion
general remarks
for a comprehensive functional and biochemical characterization of organisms, an inventory of their proteins and protein modifications is a prerequisite. in the work presented here, we performed a liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry based qualitative proteome approach with the goal to generate a first protein catalogue of daphnia pulex, the genome of which is presented in this special issue. to complement gene sequences, the generation of a broad dataset of tandem ms  spectra derived from daphnia peptides is particularly interesting for two main reasons:

i) high throughput ms/ms protein identification is based on the comparison of experimentally acquired peptide ms/ms spectra with in silico generated theoretical spectra deduced from protein databases. with a large set of ms/ms spectra it can be tested if the daphnia filtered models protein database is suitable in its current form for proteomics approaches, which are mostly based on protein identification by ms/ms.

ii) the generation of ms/ms spectra derived from daphnia peptides will lead to the creation of a catalogue of identified daphniid peptides. this will be one of the first datasets giving experimental evidence for a variety of so far only predicted proteins. the daphnia filtered models protein database in its current form consists of more than  <dig>  entries. the corresponding genes were either found by est sequencing, by homology searches, or ab initio by gene prediction algorithms. however, for the broad majority of database entries, there is so far no experimental evidence that the corresponding genes are in fact translated and the resulting proteins persist in the organism.

experimental strategy
among all presently available proteomic techniques, the application of liquid chromatography  as a separation tool combined with electrospray ionization   <cit>  tandem mass spectrometry  as an identification tool has the highest performance in terms of protein identifications per time unit. this technique is referred to as lc-ms/ms and has proven its efficiency in many studies  <cit> . since eukaryotic proteomes consist of highly complex mixtures, the reduction of complexity by pre-fractionation on the level of intact proteins prior to lc-ms/ms analysis is mandatory. the number of identifications usually increases with the overall extent of prefractionation efforts. because of its high separation strength we choose 1d-sds-gel electrophoresis for pre-fractionation on the protein level. in this pilot study a number of  <dig> gel fractions were chosen. to determine the impact of two versus one chromatographic steps on the number of identified peptides, we compared the results obtained with one-dimensional reversed phase  liquid chromatography  versus a combination of strong cation-exchange  with rp chromatography. the major advantage of the scx – rp combination is the removal of salt ions from the scx fractions in the rp step, which would otherwise interfere with the ms-analysis of peptide ions. for reasons of performance, we choose a fully automatic online setup, where scx fractions are directly eluted onto a rp trap column. this rp trap column is then switched into the rp chromatography system to finally separate the peptides. the scx flow through as well as  <dig> salt fractions from each of the  <dig> gel slices were captured and analyzed by lc-ms/ms; leading to a total number of  <dig> 1d-lc-ms/ms runs . from this workflow,  <dig>  ms/ms spectra were obtained.

results obtained with lc-ms/ms
using sds-page combined with 1d-lc-ms/ms, we identified  <dig> entries whereas the sds-page – 2d-lc-ms combination led to the identification of  <dig> entries from the non-redundant filtered models database of putative daphnia proteins demonstrating the benefit of a second chromatographic step. in total, we were able to identify  <dig> non-redundant filtered models database proteins of putative daphnia pulex proteins. the overall list of identified proteins can be downloaded as additional file  <dig> 

considering that the main goal of our experiments was to test the benefit of a dedicated daphnia protein database for lc-ms/ms-based proteomics, this result is promising with respect to the straightforward design of this pilot study. as recently demonstrated by  <cit> , an extensive prefractionation on the level of the biological sample , on the cellular, on the subcellular level as well as on the level of proteins and peptides had to be performed to get a catalogue of thousands of experimentally identified proteins from drosophila. our results clearly demonstrate that lc-ms/ms analysis combined with the usage of the daphnia filtered models database is able to identify hundreds of daphnia proteins with a high confidence level in a very efficient way. therefore, this methodology combined with further pre-fractionation steps will lead to an increased analytical depth of the daphnia proteome.

determination of false positive ratios
the general strategy to identify peptides by high-throughput ms/ms experiments is a probability based comparison of experimental spectra with theoretical spectra calculated from protein databases deduced from dna sequences. the software algorithms determine the closest match and a score indicating the reliability of the result. although this identification strategy has proven its strength in many studies, cut-off values for the obtained scores must be chosen carefully to minimize false-positive identifications  <cit> . unfortunately, there are no general rules for the confidence of given scores, because their reliability depends on the experimental setup as well as on the database used for the search. in our study, we applied the commonly used mascot  <cit>  search engine, returning a so called "ions score" for each peptide  of proteins could be identified in more than one gel slice, as summarized in fig.  <dig>  a heterogeneity of molecular masses is frequently observed in this kind of approaches  <cit> . and may be caused by posttranscriptional events such as alternative splicing, posttranslational modifications or proteolytic processing. while, inadequate separation strength of the gel can be excluded due to the presence of sharp distinct bands , proteolysis of these proteins prior to electrophoresis may contribute to this heterogeneity. proteolysis can be caused by daphnia proteases from the intestinal tract. the proteolytic activity of daphnia magna gut protease was previously described  <cit> . in preliminary studies in which we performed 2d-gel electrophoresis of daphnia magna and daphnia longicephala lysates, we tried to eliminate this proteolytic activity with several commercially available protease inhibitor cocktails. the list of tested inhibitors, including the used concentrations, is shown in table  <dig>  however, the obtained spot patterns of all prepared 2d-gels still reflected significant protein degradation .

as the efficient inhibition of daphnia proteases plays a crucial role in further quantitative proteome studies, we screened our catalogue of identified daphnia proteins for proteases. in total, we have identified  <dig> different proteins out of the daphnia database showing significant homology  to known proteases with exo- as well as endopepdidase activity . in the case of the daphnia trypsin proteases identified, the masses of the detected peptides did not fit with the theoretical peptide masses of the porcine trypsin used for digestion of the samples. hence, these peptides clearly originate from daphnia proteins. the list of daphnia proteases in table  <dig> provides a basis for further sophisticated experiments, e.g. determination of cleavage specificities and screening for protease inhibitors.

usability of the d. pulex filtered models database for proteome research on other daphnia subgenera
in phylogenetics, the genus daphnia is split into three subgenera, daphnia, hyalodaphnia and ctenodaphnia. sequence divergence between those subgenera indicates an origin in the mesozoic  <cit> . evolution under different environmental conditions such as uv radiation, salinity or predator regimes was certainly a key factor for diversification in this genus. to validate the utility of the daphnia pulex genome sequence for proteome research on differing daphnia species, we generated lc-ms/ms data of d. longicephala samples. d. longicephala was chosen due to the fact that it belongs to the taxon of ctenodaphnia, in contrast to d. pulex which is grouped in the subgenus daphnia. moreover, d. longicephala is one of the most prominent examples for morphological plasticity  <cit>  and provides an ideal model organism for future work on the genetic basis of the phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity.

for the proteome analysis of d. longicephala, identical amounts of total protein and the same 2d-lc-ms/ms strategy outlined for d. pulex was used. we were able to identify  <dig> proteins from the non-redundant filtered models database of putative daphnia pulex proteins. the difference in number of identified proteins in d. pulex  may well mirror the genetic divergence between both daphnia subgenera. this finding reflects the fact that even a single amino acid exchange in a given peptide mostly impairs its automatic identification by ms/ms search algorithms. nevertheless, the number of identifications obtained from d. longicephala samples demonstrates the suitability of the d. pulex filtered models database for proteome investigations with other daphnia subgenera.

another finding is that  <dig> proteins were exclusively found in the daphnia longicepha samples as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  this result might reflect different concentrations of a given protein in lysates of d. pulex and d. longicephala, e.g. through different metabolic activity and/or differences in their cellular assembly. on the other hand, this result may be due to undersampling, i.e., in highly complex samples, the number of co-eluting peptides exceeds the number of ms/ms spectra which can be acquired by the instrument. therefore in individual lc-ms/ms runs, different low-intensity peptides may be selected for ms/ms analysis by the instrument software. the overall list of identified proteins can be downloaded as additional file  <dig> 

the impact of the d. pulex filtered models database for proteome research of daphniids
although several genome projects on crustaceans are in progress, only expressed sequence tag  libraries  or the sequence of the mitochondrial genome  <cit>  are available in other crustacean species. in cases where only few protein sequences are known, it is a common strategy to search ms/ms-data against databases of the most related species in order to identify identical peptides within the homologous proteins.

to estimate the impact of the d. pulex filtered models database for high-throughput proteomics of daphniids, we compared the results obtained with the daphnia database with the results obtained by searching our ms/ms dataset against two additional databases: as a species specific database we selected the drosophila melanogaster database from flybase  <cit>   consisting of  <dig>  protein sequences. we chose this species because d. melanogaster, belongs to the taxon of hexapoda  and is the closest relative of daphnia pulex with a characterized complete genome sequence  <cit> . both arthropod species belong to a group called pancrustacea, although monophyly of this group is still discussed  <cit> .

the pancrustacean hypothesis, which is supported by molecular analysis , queries that myriapoda are the closest relatives to hexapoda but renders crustaceans and hexapods as sister taxa. given that the latter have likely diverged  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and have evolved in completely different habitats – crustaceans predominantly in aquatic, insects in terrestrial environments – it is expected that protein expression should reflect these evolutionary challenges. even though some crustacean gene families, such as genes responsible for embryonic development are shared with hexapoda  <cit> , several daphnia genes show no sequence similarity to other arthropods  <cit> . therefore, gene transcripts different from those of d. melanogaster might reflect adaptations to aquatic habitats such as chemoreception, oxygen uptake or osmoregulation.

as a protein database of a broad variety of species we chose the metazoa subset of the swiss-prot database  providing a minimum of redundancy. to facilitate a comparison of the results obtained with the different databases, searches of ms/ms spectra were performed using exactly the same parameters. setting a false-positive identification threshold of 1%, only  <dig> daphnia proteins matched to the drosophila database and  <dig> to the swiss-prot database. this finding clearly demonstrates that the d. pulex filtered models database in its current form increases dramatically the number of ms-based identifications and represents an indispensable tool for high-throughput proteome experiments in daphniids. however, many proteins may still be missing in the database. therefore, yet unassigned spectra in our data set can help to find undisclosed coding regions within the daphnia genome. suitable algorithms comprise searching against the entire daphnia genome sequence or de-novo sequencing – ms blast approaches as described by shevchenko et al.  <cit> . finally, the database supports detailed 2d gel analyses to quantify and identify proteins. the application of the latter technique allows the determination of isolelectric points and molecular weights of the proteins and enables the detection of protein isoforms by comparison of experimentally determined ips with theoretical ips from database analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
given that daphnia is an important model organism, for instance to test for deleterious effects of pollutants or environmental changes, the implementation of state of the art techniques in molecular biology such as lc-ms/ms is an auspicious opportunity to unravel mechanisms triggering those critical environmental issues.

our study is the first applying a lc-ms/ms based proteomic approach in daphnia that reflects the utility of the daphnia genome database for molecular works on this multifaceted model organism in several fields of biological research. since a variety of daphnia species are used for different scientific approaches, for instance to elucidate the phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity in daphniids  <cit>  at least  <dig> species have been investigated intensively, it is essential to know the reliability of the daphnia pulex genome sequence for studies on other species. we give experimental evidence for the translation of a broad variety of predicted coding regions within the daphnia genome by using high throughput ms/ms protein identification in two daphnia species. our data demonstrates the applicability of proteomics research in d. pulex as well as in other daphnia species. this will stimulate work on hypothetical functions for yet unclassified proteins followed by functional experiments in this new model organism. moreover, proteomics techniques allow to identify proteins linked to biological phenomena such as induced predator defenses, host parasite-interactions or stress responses to toxic substances.
