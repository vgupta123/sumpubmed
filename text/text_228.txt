BACKGROUND
retrotransposition is an important evolutionary driving force for the creation of new genes with novel lineage- and species-specific phenotypic traits. new genes created through retrotransposition are retrogenes that are devoid of introns. furthermore, paralogues are subsequently created through segmental duplications and sequence modifications. retrogenes could be re-activated by putative promoters and other transcription regulatory elements suitably located upstream of the retrogene insertion sites  <cit> . in the process of transcriptional re-activation, the newly arisen transcript may acquire one or more noncoding exons in the 5'-untranslated region . in the context of our current knowledge of the generation of multiple transcripts from a single gene through alternative splicing  <cit> , the term "retrogene" is used throughout this paper to mean the "genomic copy" of a gene that is consituted of a complete coding sequence without intron interruption taking no consideration on whether the resulting transcripts carry exonised sequences through alternative splicing. whether or not "retrogene" should be redefined as such is debatable.

many retrogenes are functional  <cit> . it has further been estimated that there are in excess of  <dig>  transcribed retrocopies in the human genome over a tenth of which is biologically active  <cit> . interestingly, the bulk of retrogenes is preferably expressed in the testis where the retrogene products actively participate in the spermatogenesis process and serve to further enhance biological functions unique to the male germline  <cit> . transcription in the testis is not as tightly regulated as in other somatic tissues due to hyper transcription rates which could result in non-discriminatory activation of otherwise imperfect or weak promoters  <cit> . such a mode of promiscuous transcription, and possibly erratic alternative splicing processes, could lead to the generation of fortuitous testicular transcripts. promiscuous transcription and transient transcriptional gene activation have also been shown to occur at the crucial stage of zygotic genome activation  <cit> . one outstanding feature of promiscuos transcription is excessive transcription of highly repetitive genomic sequences  <cit> . the bulk of genomic repetitive sequences are transposable elements . a significant number of mammalian genes has been shown to be regulated by transcriptional elements of the endogenous retroviruses  or long-terminal repeats  of tes  <cit> . evidence is emerging to suggest that ervs and other tes may constitute a critical driving force in speciation  <cit> .

we have previously proposed the existence of a novel bipartite tdpoz protein family members of which carry the td , also called math /btb   <cit> . almost all known eukaryotic td proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of protein processing and ubiquitination  <cit> . the representative td proteins, the tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factors , bind to the tumour necrosis factor receptors or other adaptor molecules to participate in cellular proliferation and survival, and in cell-death signalling  <cit> . on the other hand, poz proteins have been implicated in biological processes including dna damage responses, cell cycle progression and in embryonic developmental events and hematopoietic stem cell fate determination  <cit> . the td and poz domains are found in separate proteins in association with other dna-binding or protein-protein interacting domains except for the tdpoz bipartite proteins that we have first reported  <cit> . tdpoz genes are found in both higher and lower animals and in plants suggesting important biological functions. to date, the only functionally characterised mammalian tdpoz protein is the nuclear speckle-associated protein spop. spop acts as an adaptor of daxx in the ubiquitination process involving cul3-based ubiquitin ligase contributing to regulation of hedgehog/gli signalling  <cit> .

in the mouse and rat genomes, tdpoz sequences appear in multiplicity as retrocopies of full-length or truncated coding sequences uninterrupted by introns  <cit> . tdpoz retrogene multiplicity is found only in the two completely sequenced rodent genomes and not in other animals and plants suggesting that the tdpoz retrogenes emerged after the evolutionary divergence of the rodent lineage. the first reported mouse tdpoz retrogene, tdpoz <dig> , is transcribed in the egg and in the pre-implantation-stage embryo  <cit> . other mouse tdpoz retrogenes are subsequently identified and are found to be transcribed in low levels in the pre-implantation embryo and in the testis  <cit> . in the rat, the rtdpoz-t <dig> and -t <dig> genes   are transcribed specifically in the testis  <cit> . database interrogations of the rat genome have further revealed ~ <dig> hits of tdpoz homologous sequences, dubbed rtdpoz for rat tdpoz, that show >85% sequence identities with the t <dig> or t <dig> open reading frame ; these sequence hits are distributed over seven different chromosomes of the rat genome. however, the bulk of the hits is found in a  <dig> -mb cluster in the rn2_ <dig> supercontig  mapping at 2q <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . active retrotransposition and duplication are thought to be the major forces driving the creation and expansion of the rtdpoz sequence repertoire in the contemporary rat genome. in a ~800-kb region at the 2q <dig> locus, twenty-six rtdpoz retrogenes are discerned, including t <dig> and t <dig>  <cit> . the biological functions of the putative t <dig> and t <dig> proteins have yet to be elucidated. on alignment of the cdna and genomic dna sequences, it has been determined that the major 3'-terminal exon of the testicular t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts carry the uninterrupted coding sequences, qualifying t <dig> and t <dig> as retrogenes; however, the transcripts have also acquired two to three short noncoding exons in the 5'-untranslated region  of the transcripts . intriguingly, all the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts share a common 5'-leader exon 1a sequence that appears only once at 2q <dig> and is also unique in the entire rat genome. how exon 1a is added to the 5'-ends of both the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts remains to be addressed. we have also previously reported a minor testicular transcript, dubbed t <dig>  which appears to be a fusion of t <dig> and t <dig> exons  <cit> . are there other t1-t <dig> "chimeric" transcripts, and how are these transcripts generated? in this work, we further explore other novel features in the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts in an attempt to further understand transcription and pre-mrna processing of retrogenes.

RESULTS
developmental regulation of t <dig> and t <dig> expression
to determine the expression status of the t <dig> and t <dig> genes during development, rna was prepared from developmental stages between day  <dig>  to day  <dig>  just before birth. rt-pcr was performed using t1- or t2-discriminating primers located in different exon sequences of the genes . the rt-pcr results show that t <dig> was expressed only at stages e <dig> to e <dig> of development  with a distinctive expression profile for each stage indicating differential t <dig> transcription at these developmental stages. on the other hand, t <dig> was expressed up to e <dig> and the expression profile was rather consistent and was largely similar to that of the testis  <cit>  except that at e <dig>  extra bands were detected, and at e <dig> only the lower band was present . the transcription profiling experiments, hence, establish that expression of the testicular t <dig> and t <dig> genes is developmentally regulated, and that there exists a notable disparity in the expression patterns of the genes at specific developmental stages. this suggests that transcription of the two genes, despite the sharing of the leader exon 1a, is differentially regulated. the t <dig> and t <dig> genes, are silenced at day  <dig>  and day  <dig>  of development, respectively, when organogenesis is now completed and the foetus enters the active phase of growth and expansion.

assorted 5'-utr structures derived from alternative splicing involving transposable element sequences
to fully characterise the multiple t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts, a combination of rt-pcr and rapid amplification of cdna ends  approaches was applied. in the rt-pcr approach, each of the rt-pcr bands was cloned and two to three clones generated from each rt-pcr product were randomly selected for sequence analysis . in this effort, a total of eleven unique t <dig> and t <dig> transcript sequences were derived for all the expressing stages . to define the 5'- and 3'-ends, race experiments were conducted. to avoid discrimination between t <dig> and t <dig> in the race analysis and to increase specificity and sensitivity in detecting transcripts of low abundance, t <dig> and t <dig> consensus primers were used in the first-round cdna synthesis followed by second-round nested pcr using t1- or t2-specific primers. a total of forty-nine 5'-race and twenty-five 3'-race clones were obtained and sequenced. the vast majority of the 5'race sequences were identical with the t <dig> and t <dig> transcript sequences obtained in the rt-pcr experiments above. moreover, all t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts carried the leader exon 1a and the 5'-termini were largely similar to those first reported for the testicular transcripts  <cit> . in the 3'-race analysis, the sequences obtained for the t <dig> transcripts at all developmental stages were identical to the 3'-end of the testicular t <dig> gene and were used to construct the full t <dig> transcript sequences . for the t <dig> transcripts, all except one 3'-race sequences were identical to the 3'-end of the testicular t <dig> transcript. the novel t <dig> 3'-terminal sequence  was a 542-bp 3'-extension of the regular 3'-end for the t <dig> transcripts; the extended 3' sequence also possesses a putative but non-canonical ataaaa polyadenylation signal located 6-bp upstream of the polya tail . a query of the giri repbase database further revealed that the extension was a segment of the non-long terminal repeat  long interspersed element  <dig>  sequence . on the other hand, a similar but shorter transcript, t1e16-a , lacks this l <dig> extension .

the uncovering in the 3'-race experiments of the extended 3'-utr sequence of t <dig> warranted further rt-pcr analysis to confirm the authenticity of the 3'-extension and to further investigate if other t <dig> transcripts carried similar 3'-extension. to achieve this goal, two-round nested rt-pcr was performed across the entire gene sequences stretching from the 5'-terminal exon 1a to the extended l <dig> sequence using primers ex1a-b and 3096r followed by the use of primers ex1a-a and 2965r . in the three t1-expressing developmental stages, one or two rt-pcr bands were discerned indicating, indeed, the existence of multiple t <dig> transcripts with the 3'-extension . the pcr products were subsequently cloned and sequenced and the sequences are designated with the prefix "xt" . full-length xt transcripts are constructed assuming they share the same testicular 5'- and the 3'-end of t1e16-b . a notable exception in the xt transcripts was t1e14-xt <dig> which included a new 45-bp exon the sequence of which was located 887-bp downstream of the leader exon 1a; this transcript also lacks the ubiquitous exons  <dig> and  <dig>  of t <dig> .

the sequences generated by rt-pcr and race were combined to construct full-length t <dig> and t <dig> transcript sequences as follows. for the t <dig> transcripts, 3'-race experiments generated two authentic 3'-ends: the first is as found in the testicular t <dig> transcript and the second is represented by t1e16-b that carries an extended 3'-end resulting from incorporation of an l <dig> sequence. hence, all "xt" transcripts  were complemented with the extended 3'-end of t1e16-b whilst the remaining t <dig> transcripts were 3'-tagged with the 3'-terminal sequence of the testicular t <dig> sequence . for t <dig>  all transcript sequences were tagged with the only 3'-end of the testicular t <dig> derived by 3'-race . to discern possible exon organisation, the transcript sequences were used to query the rat genome sequence . all discernible exon sequences were qualified by the presence of the consensus splice junctions. furthermore, all transcript sequences were also subjected to scrutiny for repetitive sequences by querying the giri repbase database. it is noted in the repbase analysis that the ubiquitous exon  <dig> of t <dig>  and exon  <dig> of t <dig>  are derivatives of l <dig> and the endogenous viral  te sequences, respectively. the derived exon organisation of the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts is displayed in figure  <dig>  in the t <dig> transcript category, transcripts identical to the testicular t <dig> are detected at e <dig>  and e <dig>  but not at the e14-stage of development. most developmental transcripts retain either or both the testicular exons  <dig> and  <dig>  except for t1e14-xt <dig> that has lost both exons. furthermore, t1e14-rt <dig> has retained the 534-bp intron separating exons  <dig> and  <dig>  more significantly, seven t <dig> transcripts carry superfluous exons sandwiched between exons 1a and  <dig>  . the t1e16-b transcript appears to embody all these superfluous exons in two clusters derived from two distinct genomic sequences, designated as l1-erv and s1-hat for convenience of description, whereas other transcripts carry alternatively spliced segments of these two genomic sequences. the l1-erv sequence was a composition of a ~170-bp relic sequence of the highly repetitive l <dig> fused to a short remnant of erv sequence . the s1-hat genomic segment is a ~ <dig> -kb sequence composed of eight short interspersed element  <dig>  remnant sequences and the hat  dna transposon  <cit>  . in a blast query, the s1-hat sequence was further found to be duplicated in tandem in chromosome  <dig> and an almost identical copy was also discerned in chromosome  <dig> of the rat genome . different spliced segments of these two genomic sequences are stitched to different t <dig> transcripts using the splice sites depicted in figure  <dig>  for example, the all-encompassing t1e16-b transcript harbours two l <dig> and two erv subfragments of these two te genomic sequences . incorporation of extraneous te-associated exons results in extended 5'-utrs in the t <dig> transcripts with potential biological consequences as is demonstrated below.

on the other hand, the developmental t <dig> transcripts are uncomplicated in exon organisation . all developmental t <dig> transcripts also carry the leader exon 1a and the uninterrupted coding exon  <dig> . the testicular exon  <dig> , which itself is an erv remnant, may or may not be associated with the developmental t <dig> transcripts. in t2e16-rt <dig>  a superfluous exon derived from l <dig> is found located between the constitutive exon 1a and the coding exon  <dig> replacing exon t2- <dig> . the t <dig> transcripts may be simpler in exon organisation but they are still tinted by te-derived exons.

in summary, sequence analysis of the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts indicates extensive alternative splicing events involving sequences of various highly repetitive te sequences contributing to the 5'-utr of the transcripts, particularly the t <dig> transcripts. in the 3'-utr, two major termination sites were elucidated for the t <dig> transcripts with the 3'-distal termination site contributed by l <dig>  it is also observed that the overall exon organisation of the t <dig> transcripts is uncomplicated whereas the t <dig> transcripts vary extensively in the 5'-utr structure when expressed during development.

detection of t1-t <dig> chimeric transcripts
in our previous work, we presented a testicular transcript which was a composite of t <dig> and t <dig> sequences  <cit> . to authenticate t1-t <dig> chimerism in this work, rt-pcr was performed using a t1- or t2-exon 2-specific forward primer in mix-gene combinations with a t <dig> or t <dig> reverse primers located at the 3'-utr of the respective gene for detection of possible t1-t <dig> or t2-t <dig> exon constitutions. to increase sensitivity and specificity, two rounds of nested pcr were performed: the first-round pcr was done using an exon 1a primer  common to both t <dig> and t <dig>  and a t <dig> or t <dig> 3'-utr sequence-specific reverse primer . in the pcr, plasmids carrying the t <dig> or t <dig> cdna sequence were included as controls; these plasmids generated positive bands corresponding to the respective gene indicating gene specificity . when the testicular mrna was used in the first-round rt-pcr using the t <dig> or t <dig> primers, two major bands were discerned . for subsequent pcr, t1- or t2-specific exon  <dig> forward primer  was used in a mix-gene fashion in combination with the t2- or t1-specific reverse primer  located at the 3'-utr sequence of the respective gene . in the control experiments in which the t <dig> and t <dig> plasmids were also tested in the mix-gene reactions, no pcr products were detected as expected for such mono-gene scenarios . however, when the testicular first-round cdna products were subjected to the mix-gene pcr, two distinct bands were now discerned in each of the mix-gene reactions .

the pcr bands were excised and cloned; two or more clones derived from each of these bands were sequenced; the sequences are given the prefixes t <dig> or t <dig> in the order of appearance of the t <dig> and t <dig> sequences. exon mapping of the sequences derived clearly shows that the mix-gene pcr products are t2–t <dig> or t1–t <dig> chimeric transcripts defined by accurate splice-site demarcation . the  <dig> -kb t21te-rt <dig> sequence is composed of the t <dig> exon  <dig> and partial exon  <dig> truncated within the coding sequence, and the t <dig> exons are accurately spliced to the t <dig> exons  <dig>   <dig> and the full coding sequence of exon  <dig>  the  <dig> -kb t21te-rt <dig> sequence carries t <dig> exon  <dig>  which is spliced to exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of t <dig> . conversely, the  <dig> -kb t12te-rt <dig> sequence is composed of the t <dig> exon  <dig>  spliced to exon  <dig> and the coding exon  <dig> of t <dig> . the t12te-rt <dig> sequence was simplest in structure in being composed of t1-exon  <dig> coupling with the coding t2-exon  <dig>  since these transcript sequences were rt-pcr products obtained rather forcefully through two rounds of pcr, they most likely represent minor populations of authentic t1–t <dig> chimeric transcripts. the naturally occurring 5'- and 3'-ends had not been determined for these chimeric transcripts. we have, thus, produced further experimental evidence that t1–t <dig> or t2-t <dig> chimeric transcripts do exist and their existence raises the question on how these transcripts are generated

embedment of t <dig> and t <dig> exons in a minefield of te sequences
exon mapping reveals that the t <dig> and t <dig> exon sequences are dispersed over a ~ <dig> kb segment in the sequence of the rat rn2_ <dig> supercontig . using a threshold of > <dig> % sequence identity in blast-based queries, the relative physical locations of all the t <dig> and t <dig> exons are derived as shown in a linear order in table  <dig> and figure 5a. an important outcome of this analysis is the finding of duplicated cassettes of the t <dig> exons  <dig> and  <dig>  each with a short intron of ~ <dig> bp separating the exons . for t <dig>  there are also two cassettes of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  . t <dig> exons 2– <dig> in the second  cassette are arranged in a linear order and are separated by relatively short introns. however, the exons in the first  cassette are arranged disorderly in a 4-2- <dig> exon configuration, and the coding exon  <dig> is mapped  <dig>  kb upstream of the tight exons 2– <dig> doublet. a comprehensive exon map is constructed to include all the identified exons; the exons are also re-named based on the linearity of appearance and their presence in the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts . in the revised exon designation scheme, the numerical indicates the order of appearance of the exons; suffices "a" and "b" are used to denote different alleles of the same exons.

sequences with > <dig> % identity between the t <dig> and t <dig> transcript sequences and the genomic sequence of the rn2_ <dig> supercontig  are listed. exons are tabulated in order of appearance in the genomic sequences. putative t <dig> and t <dig> coding exons are shown in heavy letters and are asterisked. the solid and dashed boxes denote the unique t2- and t1-specific exons, respectively, that are duplicated in different chromosomal locations. the relative exon positions are schematized in fig. 5a.

as presented in the preceding sections, numerous t <dig> and t <dig> exons are derivatives of the highly repetitive sequences of the l <dig> and erv transposable elements . when the ~700-kb genomic sequence that harbours all the t <dig> and t <dig> exons were subjected to a repbase query, the sequence was found to be heavily mined with relics of te sequences. an average te occupancy of ~60% is computed; some segments contain as high as ~70% te sequences . in this genomic region, the unique t <dig> and t <dig> exons are precariously embedded within the te minefield. when a transcription read-through primary transcript carries such a heavy loading of redundant te sequences, te sequences that have developed favourable splice junctions could readily be harvested as exons and be inducted into mature transcripts as typically exemplified by the t <dig> transcripts t1e16-a and t1e16-b . in the more simplistic t <dig> splicing, the erv-mt2a has become an almost permanent landmark of the t <dig> transcripts harvested as exon 3a  . in the same token, the erv-mt2b-derived exon 8a or 8b  has also become a permanent fixture of the t <dig> transcripts . at the 3'-end, transcription read-though of the regular transcription termination site into a downstream l <dig> sequence has also resulted in an extended 3'-utr in a significant population of t <dig> transcripts .

a model of t <dig> and t <dig> transcription and post-transcriptional processing
only one copy of exon  <dig>  could be identified in the ~700-kb genomic sequence and also in the entire rat genome. when the completed mouse genome was interrogated for possible presence of the rat exon 1-like sequence, only one exon  <dig> copy was found on chromosome  <dig>  with a  <dig> % sequence identity but there were short ~50-bp segments showing >90% identities between the two sequences . when longer  genomic sequences encompassing exon  <dig> and about 1-kb upstream sequences of the two rodents were aligned, sequence identity remained high at  <dig> %  indicating evolutionary relatedness. the described mouse-rat genomic sequence identity further supports the uniqueness of the exon  <dig> sequence in the rat genome. interestingly, this exon  <dig> sequence is found only in the rodent genomes and not in the genomes of other animals and plants examined  suggesting that the exon had evolved independently since the branching out of the rodent lineage.

since all t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts carry the unique exon  <dig>  our results clearly suggest that both genes are transcribed using a common promoter associated with this leader exon. based on the derived exon order depicted in figure 5a, the generation of the t <dig> transcripts is a simple and direct affair through cis splicing of the proposed pri-a primary transcript .  to explain the generation of the t <dig> transcripts initiating from the exon  <dig> promoter, transcription read-through of the t <dig> exon cluster and a run up to the 3'-distal exon cluster would have to be invoked to first generate a ~600-kb pri-b <dig> primary transcript that terminates at the t1-coding exon 6b  followed by appropriate cis splicing . the downstream t1-coding exon 6b, but not the upstream exon 6a, would have been used due to the fact that the other preceding exons, exons 7a and 8a , are in the correct linear order in the downstream cluster but not the upstream exon cluster . in this scheme, it could not, however, be ascertained if the upstream exons 7a-8a or the downstream 7b-8b exon doublet is used. to explain the generation of the t1–t <dig> chimeric transcripts, transcription initiating from the exon  <dig> promoter and the generation of the transcription read-through primary transcripts pri-b <dig> and -b <dig> would have to occur followed by alternative splicing . for example, the t12te-rt <dig> chimera would have used the upstream exon 7a  that normally appears in t <dig> transcripts splicing to the downstream t <dig> noncoding exon 3b  and the coding exon 4b ; the t21te-rt <dig> chimera would have used the t <dig> exon 3b  stitching to the t <dig> exons 7b-8b-6b cluster.

taken together, the proposed exon organisation offers a model of co-transcription and post-transcriptional processing to explain the structure of the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts. firstly, the close proximity of the leader exon  <dig> with the t <dig> exons  explains why the t <dig> transcripts are uncomplicated with fewer splice variants whereas the t <dig> transcripts are highly erratic and are frequently infused with te sequences due to the extended size of the proposed primary transcripts. secondly, the model also dissembles that chimeric transcripts in both the t1–t <dig> and t2-t <dig> orientations are generated as rogue transcripts that have acquired illegitimate exons of the cousin gene through erratic alternative splicing. although there is no evidence of alternative trans splicing, this possibility could not, however, be completely ruled out.

translational repression by te-derived uaugs and uorfs of t <dig> transcripts
in the 5'-utr sequence of the testicular t <dig> transcript, we could discern three upstream augs  and two upstream open reading frames  of 21- and 75-bp in length both of which are derived from the inserted te sequence ; the upstream 21-bp uorf is in the same reading frame with the t <dig> coding sequence . the 5'-utr-truncated t1e16-rt <dig> transcript lacks the te insertions and, hence, the two uorfs in the 5'-utr . in the lengthy 5'-utr of the t1e16-a transcript the bulk of which is composed of erv and l <dig> sequences , a total of twelve uaugs and seven uorfs are discernible in all three reading frames with sizes ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp .

to investigate if te-containing 5'-utr sequences of different t <dig> transcripts contribute to regulation of gene expression, the 5'-utr sequences of the t <dig>  t1e16-rt <dig> and t1e16-a transcripts were inserted before the luciferase gene under the regulation of the sv <dig> promoter and an sv <dig> enhancer; the constructs were used in transient transfection of the chinese hamster ovary cell line, cho-k <dig>  followed by luciferase activity assays . the results show that the luciferase activities under the regulation of the uaug- and uorf-free t1e16-rt <dig> were maximal in the presence or absent of the sv <dig> enhancer. on the other hand, the uorf-abundant 5'-utr of t1e16-a resulted in the lowest levels of luciferase activity whereas the t <dig> construct with two uorfs showed intermediate level of luciferase activity. similar albeit lower relative luciferase activities were obtained using the testicular cancer cell line lc- <dig> in similar transfection and luciferase assays .

to determine if the varied luciferase activities observed are associated with differential rna stabilities, total rna was prepared from the transfected cells at different post-transfection time points for rt-pcr analysis. at each of the time points examined, the luciferase mrna level was found to be comparable for the three 5'-utr constructs indicating similar luciferase mrna stability despite the presence of different 5'-utr sequences . to discern possible regulation at the translation step, western blot analysis of lysate of the same sets of transfected cells was performed using an anti-luciferase antibody. the results show that the luciferase protein level was maximal for t1e16-rt <dig>  minimal for t1e16-a and intermediate for t <dig>  in direct agreement with the relative luciferase activities determined above . the effects of uaugs and uorfs on translation were further supported by data derived from mutagenesis analysis of the two uorfs of t <dig> in the luciferase constructs . on removal of either or both the uorfs of t <dig>  luciferase activities were partially restored. our data collectively indicate that different 5'-utr sequences in the t <dig> transcript variants carrying different numbers of te-derived uaugs and uorfs could result in repressed translation of the t <dig> gene.

discussion
in a previous work, we first described testis-specific transcription of the rtdpoz-t <dig> and -t <dig> genes  <cit> . in this work, we show that t <dig> and t <dig> are also transcribed in the developing embryo . more significantly, we show that each of the uninterrupted t <dig> and t <dig> coding exons are duplicated and the exons are embedded in a dense field of te sequences. consequently, the embryonic t1/t <dig> transcription displays two novel features: co-transcription of the two genes and frequent exonisation of te sequences into the 5'-utrs of the transcripts.

developmentally-regulated t <dig> and t <dig> co-transcription
co-transcription of t <dig> and t <dig>  in this gene order, is proposed based on the observation that all testicular and developmental t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts discerned share a unique exon  <dig> that resides upstream of the t2/t <dig> exon assemblage . the exon  <dig> sequence is also found to be conserved as a unique sequence in the mouse genome  but not in the genomes of other animals and plants examined, consistent with evolutionary relatedness between the mouse and rat genomes. t2-t <dig> co-transcription implies that the genes are co-ordinately controlled by a common promoter and associated regulatory sequences.

t <dig> transcription is found to occur throughout the e <dig> to e <dig> developmental stages analysed and is silenced beyond e <dig>  on the other hand, t <dig> transcription is restricted only to e14–e <dig>  in rodents, the organogenesis phase of embryonic development comes to an end at about e14–e <dig> from which point on active foetal growth occurs, a process that involves active cellular proliferation as opposed to active differentiation during the organogenesis phase  <cit> . our data collectively suggest that t <dig> expression is a normal monogenic transcriptional event that uses the aauaaa polyadenylation signal located  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the polya tract of the mature t <dig> transcripts  and. on the other hand, t <dig> expression is only realised when t2-to-t <dig> transcription read-through occurs to transcribe the t <dig> coding exons . the occurrence of t2-to-t <dig> co-transcription may be attributed to high rates of transcription associated with active foetal growth similar to hyper transcription rates that have been shown in the testis  <cit> . the silencing of t1/t <dig> transcription at e17–e <dig> does not seem to involve hypermethylation of the exon  <dig> promoter which is unmethylated, despite the presence of a cpg island, in the testis and in all the developmental stages examined irrespective of t1/t <dig> expression . it remains to be investigated if developmental and testicular transcription of the t2/t <dig> locus involves chromatin remodelling or the availability of positive or negative trans-acting factors.

exonisation of te sequences into 5'-utrs of the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts
the most notable finding of this work is the high rate of exonisation of te sequences into the 5'-utrs of the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts through alternative splicing. in some t <dig> transcripts, an alternative transcription termination site is found in an l <dig> sequence located downstream of the constitutive site . frequent te exonisation is clearly associated with the embedment of the constitutive exon  <dig> and the uninterrupted t <dig> and t <dig> coding exons in a ~700-kb chromosomal segment that is heavily populated with te sequences . in this segment, the computed average te content is  <dig> %, much higher than the mean te content of 40% in the rat genome  <cit> . notably, the second exon of the t <dig> gene  and that of t <dig>  are relics of the erv-mt2a and -mt2b sequences, respectively; these te relics have developed strong and stable splice sites to be frequently recruited into 5'-utrs of the transcripts of the respective gene . we also detected apparent t2-t <dig> "chimeric" transcripts that involve only 5'-utrs . on closer examination, all the discerned t <dig> and t <dig> 5'-utr exons, with the exception of the constitutive exon  <dig> and the exon  <dig> of t <dig> , are te remnants . however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the t1– <dig> exon was also originally derived from a te sequence but had lost its te features through evolution for recognition. in other words, all 5'-utr exons, except exon  <dig>  may, in fact, be products of exonised te sequences recruited through alternative splicing.

several salient features of te insertions in the human and mouse genomes have been described based on bioinformatics analysis:  the te exons are mostly intronic;  all te families can be exonised;  te exons are found mostly in the utr, and  potential tissue-specific association  <cit> . in this report, the depicted exon organization of the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts has provided direct experimental evidence to support all of the above features of te-derived exons. an important mechanism that contributes to the exonisation of alu, a highly repetitive and primate-specific te, is the rna-editing-mediated adenosine-to-inosine  modification  <cit> . a-to-i rna editing is catalysed by adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded rna stretches of primary transcripts formed by annealing of inverted-repeat sequences in the pre-mrna  <cit> . the dense field of predominantly line <dig> and erv sequences in the t2/t <dig> locus provides ample opportunities for the t2/t <dig> pre-mrna species to form double-stranded structures for adenosine deaminase-mediated rna editing. furthermore, the te exonization may be driven by the use of cryptic exonic splicing enhancers  as proposed by lin et al.  <cit> . the exact mechanism that is responsible for exonisation of te sequences into the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts is a subject for further investigation.

biologically, te insertions into 5'-utrs of transcripts have been shown to influence gene expression at the level of transcription through the creation of new transcription factor binding sites or by other transcriptional mechanisms  <cit> . alternatively, the presence of te sequences could introduce deleterious uaugs and uorfs to repress translational initiation  <cit>  as we have demonstrated for selected t <dig> transcripts . the complexity of the t <dig> transcript population in the developing embryo impedes detailed determination of the relative abundances of the discerned transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
this work provides evidence to indicate that exonisation of te sequences is a frequent event in the transcription of retrogenes during embryonic development and in the testis and te exonisation may contribute to post-transcriptional regulation of expression of retrogenes through translational repression. the t2/t <dig> locus, thus, provide a spatio-temporal model for further dissection of developmentally-regulated and testis-specific transcription and possible biological significance of te exonisation of retrogenes.
