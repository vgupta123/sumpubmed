BACKGROUND
phosphorus  is an essential macronutrient often limiting the plant growth due to its low solubility and fixation in the soil. improving soil fertility by releasing bound phosphorus by microbial inoculants is an important aspect for increasing crop yield. phosphorus release from insoluble phosphates reported for several soil microorganisms has been attributed mainly to the production of organic acids and their chelation capacity  <cit> . direct periplasmic oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid is considered as the metabolic basis of inorganic phosphate solubilization by many gram-negative bacteria as a competitive strategy to transform the readily available carbon sources into less readily utilizable products by other microorganisms  <cit> .

increased solubilization of fixed soil phosphates and applied phosphates ensuring higher crop yields has been reported on inoculation of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria including pseudomonas, bacillus, rhizobium, micrococcus, flavobacterium, burkholderia, achromobacter, erwinia, and agrobacterium  <cit> . several pseudomonas species have been reported among the most efficient phosphate-solublizing bacteria and as important bio-inoculants due to their multiple biofertilizing activities of improving soil nutrient status, secretion of plant growth regulators, and suppression of soil-borne pathogens  <cit> .

soils in the cold deserts of lahaul and spiti in the indian trans-himalayan region latitude 31° 44' 57" and 32° 59' 57" north and 76° 46' 29" and 78° 41' 34" east are often with low moisture status, high alkalinity, and low organic matter content. the nutritional problems in such soils are often specific in respect of the low phosphorus availability resulting from their high phosphorus-fixing capacity due to high calcium content  <cit> . the vast potential of microorganisms for improving productivity in the region remains unexploited  <cit> . previously we have reported the isolation, selection, and characterization of stress-tolerant and efficient phosphate-solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonas from the cold deserts of the himalayas  <cit> . the aim of the present study was to explicate organic acid production during solubilization of inorganic phosphates and effect on plant growth as a function of phosphate solubilization by fluorescent pseudomonas.

methods
bacterial strains
nineteen phosphate-solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonas included in the present studies were isolated from the rhizosphere of hippophae rhamnoides growing in the cold deserts of lahaul and spiti in the trans-himalayas and characterized based on their phenotypic characters and 16s rdna gene sequencing  <cit> . the bacterial strains were maintained at -70°c in nutrient broth supplemented with 20%  glycerol.

production of organic acids during phosphate solubilization
the bacterial strains grown in triplicate in  <dig> ml nbrip broth supplemented with  <dig> % tricalcium phosphate , mussoorie rock phosphate , udaipur rock phosphate  and north carolina rock phosphate  at 28°c for  <dig> days at  <dig> rpm in a refrigerated incubator shaker  were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min. and passed through  <dig>  μm nylon filter. quantitative estimation of p-liberated from inorganic phosphates was done using vanado-molybdate method as described earlier  <cit> . detection and quantification of organic acids was done on waters  <dig> high performance liquid chromatogram  equipped with pda detector, waters  <dig> plus autosampler, waters  <dig> controller, waters™ pump, waters inline degasser af, and lichrosphere rp- <dig> column  <dig> mm ×  <dig>  mm and  <dig> μm particle size . the mobile phase was  <dig> % ortho-phosphoric acid  in the gradient of flow rate as given in table  <dig>  eluates were detected at λ  <dig> nm and identified by retention time and co-chromatography by spiking the sample with the authentic organic acids. the organic acids were quantified by reference to the peak areas obtained for the authentic standards for gluconic acid , 2-ketogluconic acid , and lactic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, formic acid, citric acid, malonic acid, propionic acid and tartaric acid . each replicate was analyzed in a single run on hplc for  <dig> samples for the four phosphate substrates. the values were presented as the mean of three replicates.

inoculum preparation
the bacterial strains grown in  <dig> ml trypticase soya broth  for  <dig> h at 28°c were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min. and the pellets suspended in  <dig> % nacl . the bacterial suspensions were separately mixed with sterilized activated charcoal  to give a cfu of approximately 107/g of charcoal-based bacterial inoculants.

plant growth under controlled environment
seeds of zea mays var. girija surface sterilized with 20% sodium hypochlorite for  <dig> min. and washed thrice with sterile distilled water were germinated at 25°c in moist sterile vermiculite. uniformly germinated seeds were coated with the water slurry of charcoal-based microbial inoculants  and two seeds per pot sown in  <dig> cm diameter pots filled with  <dig> kg non-sterilized sandy-loam soil. the soil used had ph  <dig> , organic matter  <dig> %, available n  <dig> %, available p  <dig> %, available k  <dig> % and available ca  <dig> %. the germinated seeds treated with the water slurry of sterilized activated charcoal without inoculum were used for the control treatments. n and k were applied in the form of ammonium sulfate @  <dig> kg n/ha, and muriate of potash @  <dig> kg k/ha, respectively. p was applied @  <dig> kg p/ha either as single super phosphate  or tricalcium phosphate  according to the various treatments. the phosphate-solubilizing bacterial  treatments included one p. fluorescens strain, three p. poae strains, ten p. trivialis strains, and five pseudomonas spp. strains in combined application with npk with tcp as the phosphate source. tcp was chosen as phosphate substrate since p-deficiency in soils of the cold deserts of lahaul and spiti is attributed mainly to the presence of insoluble di- and tricalcium phosphates. the influence of psb treatments on plant growth and soil properties was evaluated in comparison to the uninoculated control treatments with or without tcp and ssp. the pots were placed in a complete randomized block design with four replications under  <dig> μm photon m- <dig> s- <dig> mixed incandescent and fluorescent illumination, 16/ <dig> h light/dark cycle and 50–60% rh at  <dig> ± 2°c in an environment control chamber. the plants were removed carefully under a gentle flow of tap water after  <dig> days of sowing. data on root length, plant height , root dry weight and shoot dry weight were recorded. the samples were oven-dried at 70°c for  <dig> days to a constant weight for determining the dry weight.

chemical analyses
the soil samples were air dried and sieved for determining ph, available n, p, k, ca and organic matter content. the plant samples were oven-dried and powdered for estimation of total n, p and k. organic matter was determined by the modified walkley and black method  <cit> . estimation of total n was done by modified kjeldahl's method, total p by vanado-molybdate yellow colour method, total and available k by flame photometric method, and available ca in ammonium-acetate extracts  <cit> . estimation of available p was estimated by sodium biocarbonate method  <cit>  and available n by alkaline permanganate method  <cit> .

experimental design and data analyses
randomized block design with two factor factorial arrangement was adopted for conducting the experiments. the data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance  and the mean of treatments compared by duncan's multiple range test at p ≤  <dig>  using spss software version  <dig> . cluster analysis based on the organic acid profiles was performed using statistica data analysis software system version  <dig> .

discussion
the organic acid production during solubilization of inorganic phosphates by the efficient phosphate-solubilizing strains of pseudomonas trivialis, pseudomonas poae, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas spp., corroborated their involvement in phosphate solubilization  <cit> . gluconic acid was the major organic acid produced as reported during phosphate solubilization by pseudomonas sp.  <cit> , p. fluorescens  <cit> , azospirillum spp.  <cit> , citrobacter sp.  <cit> , and pseudomonas corrugata  <cit> . the production of 2-ketogluconic, oxalic, malic, lactic, succinic, formic and citric acid in small quantities by pseudomonas strains have also been reported during phosphate solubilization by arthrobacter ureafaciens, arthrobacter sp., bacillus coagulans, b. megaterium, chryseobacterium sp., citrobacter koseri, delftia sp., enterobacter intermedium, pseudomonas fluorescens, rhodococcus erythropolis and serratia marcescens  <cit> . none of pseudomonas strains produced propionic acid unlike bacillus megaterium strains during phosphate solubilization  <cit> .

the results indicated that the quantity of organic acids produced differed with the nature of phosphate substrates and pseudomonas strains . the higher solubilization of tcp than urp, mrp and ncrp could possibly be due to the higher gluconic acid production in presence of tcp. the lower production of gluconic acid and lower tcp solubilization by pseudomonas sp. bihb  <dig> than other pseudomonas strains substantiated the involvement of gluconic acid in solubilization of calcium-bound phosphates. succinic acid also appeared contributing to tcp solubilization as it was produced by high tcp-solubilizing strains and not by low tcp-solubilizing pseudomonas sp. bihb  <dig> strain. the lack of oxalic acid production by efficient phosphate-solubilizing pseudomonas strains signified non involvement of oxalic acid in tcp solubilization though this acid has been implicated besides citric, gluconic, lactic and succinic acids in phosphate solubilization in alkaline vertisols  <cit> . pseudomonas sp. strain bihb  <dig> producing the highest quantity of 2-ketogluconic acid but showing the lowest tcp and urp solubilization also differed from enterobacter intermedium reported for the enhanced phosphate solubilization with increasing 2-ketogluconic acid production  <cit> . likewise, no relationship could be ascertained between the quantity of organic acids produced and the solubilization of rock phosphates by pseudomonas strains as the highest solubilization observed for ncrp among the rock phosphates was coupled to the lowest production of total organic acids . previously also the quantities of solubilized phosphorus could not be correlated with the quantities of organic acids in the culture medium  <cit> . upr, mrp and ncrp have fluorapatite structure with the highest substitution of phosphate with carbonate in ncrp  <cit> . the higher solubilization and lowered quantities of organic acids detected in the presence of ncrp could be due to the higher reactivity and greater diversion of organic acids in the neutralization of free carbonates in the solubilization of ncrp as compared to mrp and urp  <cit> . likewise, the higher solubilization and higher production of organic acids in the presence of tcp could be attributed to its amorphous nature with simple structure and absence of any free carbonates as compared to the crystalline lattice structure of the rock phosphates  <cit> .

cluster analysis of organic acid profiles generated different groups revealing inter and intra-specific variation in the production of organic acids by pseudomonas strains . the strains clustered together and those standing outside the clusters or sub-clusters belonged to different pseudomonas species characterized previously by 16s rrna gene sequencing  <cit> . the strains standing outside the clusters differed qualitatively and/or quantitatively from other strains in the production of organic acids . the results implied that pseudomonas strains are independent of their genetic relatedness in their phosphate-solubilizing ability and organic acid production even under similar set of culture conditions. phosphate solubilization is a complex phenomenon which depends on the nutritional, physiological and growth conditions of the culture  <cit> .

the enhanced growth and higher n, p and k contents in maize with psb treatments underlined the advantage of phosphate-solubilizing activity of microorganisms for plant growth promotion . the increased growth and p uptake have been reported on psb inoculations with pseudomonas sp. and serratia marcescens in maize  <cit> , pseudomonas fluorescens in peanut  <cit> , bacillus circulans in mungbean  <cit>  and pseudomonas sp. in wheat  <cit> . the tcp solubilization in soil by fluorescent pseudomonas strains as evidenced by in vitro tcp solubilization, increased soil p availability and higher plant p content would be useful particularly in the cold deserts of lahaul and spiti where soil p deficiency is attributed mainly to the reaction of p with calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate forming insoluble di- and tricalcium phosphates. the rock phosphates recommended for acid soils are reportedly not effective in alkaline soils as p source for the crops  <cit> . the significantly higher plant growth and n, p, and k content in plant tissues and soil with some psb treatments over npsspk might be due to the immobilization of applied p by native soil microbiota and physico-chemical reactions in the soil. the increased and continuous p availability in the soil promotes biological nitrogen fixation  <cit> . no correlation among tcp solubilization, production of organic acids and plant growth promotion could be established as the highest solubilization and plant growth promoting activity was observed for p. trivialis bihb  <dig> not showing the highest organic acid production. however, the lowest organic acid production and plant growth promotion by pseudomonas sp. bihb  <dig> showing the lowest tcp solubilization suggested that phosphate solubilization is an important mechanism of plant growth promotion. pseudomonas strains exhibiting high tcp solubilization in vitro differed significantly in enhancing the plant growth in the soil indicating interplay of some other growth factors besides phosphate-solubilization . apart from making p available to the plants, phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms improve plant health directly by the production of phytohormones  <cit> . pseudomonas strains have been reported to vary in their ability for phytohormone production  <cit> . the bacterial strains also differ in utilizing root exudates in producing biologically active substances and root colonizing ability known to influence the plant growth-promoting action of rhizobacteria  <cit> . plant-microbe interaction is a complex phenomenon with the interplay of several mechanisms and environmental factors.

the decrease in soil ph in psb treatments indicated the production of organic acids by pseudomonas strains as also reported for phosphate-solubilizing aspergillus niger and a. tubingensis  <cit> . however, less ph decline in soil during plant growth promotion experiments than phosphate solubilization in culture medium could be due to the buffering nature of soil  <cit> . the inorganic acids and h+ ions of microbial origin and h+ ions released from the plant roots during ammonium assimilation are also reported to influence the soil ph  <cit> . the studies have shown potential for plant growth promotion by p. trivialis bihb  <dig>  p. trivialis bihb  <dig>  pseudomonas sp. bihb  <dig> and p. poae bihb  <dig> in the presence of tcp as the phosphate source. the native phosphate-solubilizing and stress-tolerant pseudomonas strains are expected to cohabitate as effective microbial inoculants with the crops grown in the cold deserts of lahaul and spiti.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study revealed that the innate ability of organic acid production by pseudomonas strains is independent of their genetic relatedness. significant difference in plant growth promotion among the efficient phosphate-solubilizing pseudomonas strains point at the need for selecting the potential strains based on plant growth promotion in the soils supplemented with insoluble phosphates for their targeted application. the psb strains with high potential for tcp solubilization appear promising for application in the ca-rich and p-deficit soils in the cold deserts of lahaul and spiti for which field studies are required.
