BACKGROUND
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the gram-negative bacterium responsible for porcine pleuropneumonia. this severe and highly contagious infectious respiratory disease causes major economic losses in the swine industry  <cit> . transmission is by means of aerosol or by direct contact with infected animals and the infection may result in rapid death or in severe pathology  <cit> . animals exposed to a. pleuropneumoniae may develop chronic infections or become asymptomatic carriers that may transmit the disease to healthy herds  <cit> . the virulence factors involved in colonization and induction of lung lesions, which include type iv fimbriae, lipopolysaccharides  and the pore forming rtx toxins apxi to iv, have been well characterized . the role of biofilms in a. pleuropneumoniae pathogenicity is gaining recognition.

biofilm formation is involved in the virulence of numerous bacterial pathogens including those of veterinary importance  <cit> . biofilms are defined as structured communities of bacterial cells enclosed in a self-produced matrix attached to biotic or abiotic surfaces  <cit> . the ability to form a biofilm is considered an universal trait of microorganisms. furthermore, biofilms offer protection against hostile environments, the immune response and bactericidal concentration of antibiotics or disinfectants. a. pleuropneumoniae has the ability to form biofilms under certain static growth conditions  <cit>  and several field isolates of a. pleuropneumoniae can form biofilms. for a. pleuropneumoniae, biofilm formation on polystyrene microtiter plates depends on the production of a polymer of β- <dig> -n-acetyl-d-glucosamine   <cit> . the histone-like protein h-ns represses the expression of the pgaabcd operon and the alternative sigma factor σe up-regulates the expression of the operon  <cit> . a h-ns, an autotransporter serine protease aasp and a luxs mutants formed more biofilms whereas a response regulator arca mutant was unable to form biofilms  <cit> . furthermore, the clpp protease has been recently associated with biofilm formation  <cit> . additionally, our laboratory recently used transposon mutagenesis to identify  <dig> unique genetic determinants associated with biofilm formation in a. pleuropneumoniae <cit> . the screen identified genes such as potd <dig>  ptsi, tig and rpmf, which have all been previously associated with biofilm formation in other bacterial species. furthermore, novel genetic determinants were identified. in a recent study, we also demonstrated that the biofilms of a. pleuropneumoniae field isolates were more resistant than their planktonic counterpart to ampicillin, florfenicol, tiamulin and tilmicosin  <cit> . despite recent advancements, knowledge regarding the processes involved in biofilm formation of a. pleuropneumoniae is limited. the transcriptome of heterogeneous population of eshecrichia coli biofilms have been analyzed and such analyses have provided solid insights into the biofilm lifestyle of e. coli <cit> . microarray technology has been used by our laboratory to characterize a. pleuropneumoniae grown under in vitro conditions mimicking steps of the infectious process  <cit>  and during a natural infection  <cit> .

thus, the objectives of this study were to characterize the transcriptome of planktonic cells and biofilm cells cultured at difference stages of biofilm formation cycle and to develop a protocol to grow an a. pleuropneumoniae biofilm under low-shear force in a drip-flow apparatus, a system with an air-liquid interface that can model environments such as the lungs  <cit> .

RESULTS
biofilm formation of a. pleuropneumoniae is a rapid process
it was previously observed that biofilm formation in a. pleuropneumoniae is a rapid process  <cit> . to ensure that biofilm cells were harvested at the most appropriate time for the transcriptional analysis, a biofilm time course was performed to study the biofilm cycle of a. pleuropneumoniae strain s <dig>  biomass was detectable after  <dig> h and was at its maximum after  <dig> h . surprisingly, the biofilm had started to disperse after  <dig> h and a minimum amount of biomass was detected after  <dig> h . it was hypothesized that the dispersal was either caused by a nutritional stress or the accumulation of a dispersal signal. to test this hypothesis, the spent growth medium was removed after  <dig> h and fresh bhi-nad was added to the biofilms. it was observed that changing the growth medium increased biomass and delayed the dispersal by  <dig> h . this suggested that a continuous flow of fresh nutrient or the removal of a dispersion signal is required to maintain the biofilm of a. pleuropneumoniae strain s <dig> 

to further characterize the biofilm process,  <dig> h and  <dig> h biofilms were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . for analysis, biofilms were stained with wga-oregon green to characterize the matrix, and syto- <dig> and propidium iodide to characterize the live cell population and dead cell population, respectively. for all  <dig> stains, a decrease in biomass and change in the morphology of the biofilm were observed at  <dig> h . to complement these observations, images on the z-axis plane were acquired to generate 3d-images of  <dig> h and  <dig> h biofilms. using the 3d-images, data concerning the volume and height of the biofilms were generated and biomass was calculated from the volume and area. at both time points, the biomass of the live cells within a biofilm was larger than the biomass occupied the dead cells. overall, the volume and biomass of a  <dig> h biofilm is larger than a  <dig> h biofilm . although these difference between a  <dig> h and 6h biofilm were consistent in the same experiment, the variation from day to day was too great for the difference to be statistically significant. similar variation is observed when biofilm biomass is measured with crystal violet . thus, the biomass changes observed with clsm does correlate with the changes observed with crystal violet.

athis represents the biofilm formed during the  <dig> h pre-incubation prior to the initiation of the flow of fresh medium.

bimages were obtained with a 4x objective rather than a 40x objective.

for transcriptional analysis, it was decided that microtiter-plate biofilms would be harvested after  <dig> h and 6h of incubation which correspond to growth/maturation and dispersal phases of the biofilm. furthermore, it was decided that the development of a continuous-flow system was required to study biofilm over a longer period of time.

a. pleuropneumoniae forms a large and stable biofilm in a drip-flow apparatus
to study biofilm formation over a longer time period, the properties of several systems were examined. the drip-flow apparatus was selected because it is thought to create an environment with air-liquid interface that closely resembles the lung environment  <cit> , the natural environment of a. pleuropneumoniae. furthermore, a. pleuropneumoniae is able to form a biofilm at the air-liquid interface in a glass tube  <cit> . in the drip-flow protocol, a static incubation is required to ensure that the bacteria are attached to the coupon before the flow is initiated. a  <dig> h-static incubation prior to starting the flow was selected given that biofilm formation was at its maximum between  <dig> h and  <dig> h in our microtiter assay. for the selection of a coupon to support biofilm development, the ability of a. pleuropneumoniae to form a biofilm after  <dig> h on different materials was investigated. after a  <dig> h of incubation in a lab-tek chamber, a. pleuropneumoniae was able to form a biofilm on a glass slide but was not able to form a biofilm on permanox or borosilicate cover slip . the number of cfu and the overall biofilm morphology of a. pleuropneumoniae cultured in a drip-flow apparatus were also determined after a 4h static incubation. the number of cfu per chamber was  <dig>  and the biofilm appeared as thin layers with microcolonies . the volume and biomass of live and dead cells in a  <dig> h biofilm cultured in a drip-flow apparatus was smaller than those of a microtiter plate biofilm . despite the difference in the amount of live and dead cells, the biomass of the matrix as assessed with wga was equal to the microtiter conditions . based on the observations mentioned above, it was concluded that a  <dig> h static incubation was sufficient for a biofilm to form on the glass slide before the flow was started.

to determine the “drip flow” condition, solutions of diluted bhi-nad were assessed for their ability to support the growth of a. pleuropneumoniae and for their inability to disperse a pre-formed biofilm after  <dig> min. the 50% bhi-nad condition did support growth and did not disperse the biofilm after  <dig> min. therefore, it was concluded that a 50% bhi-nad solution would be used in the fresh medium reservoir and a flow of  <dig> ml/hour per chamber would be used. after a  <dig> h static incubation, the flow was initiated and left for  <dig> h. the number of cfu and the overall biofilm morphology was then determined. the number of cfu increased from  <dig> to  <dig> per chamber after  <dig> h of flow and the biofilm was visible with the naked eye . the size of the biofilm makes microscopy analysis difficult. nevertheless, the biofilm could be stained with wga indicating the presence of pga in the matrix and the biomass of live cells was larger than the biomass of dead cells . furthermore, treatment with dispersin b dispersed the biofilm suggesting that pga is also the major component of a  <dig> h-drip flow biofilm . this is the first report that described the formation of a biofilm by a. pleuropneumoniae under low shear force and in a continuous flow system.

genes expressed under static biofilm conditions
at  <dig> h,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed  between the biofilm cells and the planktonic cells . based on their functional classification, the majority of energy metabolism genes identified as differentially expressed were down-regulated in the biofilm and represented the largest group of down-regulated genes . among those, subunits for two key enzymes for anaerobic metabolism were identified: glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and formate dehydrogenase . the largest group of up-regulated genes were transport-related genes followed by genes associated with regulatory functions . among the transport-related genes, two homologues for the transport of key metabolite in the energy metabolism were identified: a c4-dicarboxylate transporter  and a glycerol-3-phosphate transporter . one gene worth mentioning is the gene encoding the sensor histidine kinase, cpxa. it has been demonstrated that the cpxra regulates genes involved in biofilm-formation in e. coli strain mc <dig>  <cit> . additionally, several genes with unknown role or uncharacterized function were down-regulated in the biofilm.

at  <dig> h,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed  between the biofilm cells and the planktonic cells . again, the largest group of down-regulated genes and up-regulated genes were energy-metabolism genes and transport-related genes, respectively . again, subunits of the formate dehydrogenase were down-regulated in the biofilm . additionally, another key component of anaerobic metabolism, which is the anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase chain , was down-regulated in biofilm cells. a homologue for the transport of a key metabolite in the energy metabolism was also identified: a formate transporter . again, most genes that were classified in the hypothetical/unclassified/unknown class were down-regulated in the biofilm.

surprisingly, few genes were differentially expressed in a  <dig> h-static biofilm  and a  <dig> h-static biofilm  when compared to their planktonic counterpart; this represents approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genome. most of the differences between the static-biofilm and planktonic cells are related to the down-regulation of energy metabolism indicating that biofilm cells are less metabolically active as highlighted above. furthermore, up-regulation of the transport function in the biofilm cells suggests that this population relies on import of metabolites for their metabolic needs. based on the transcriptomic analysis, biofilm formation in a. pleuropneumoniae is probably not solely regulated at the transcriptional level and different post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms are probably involved. post-transcriptional regulation of biofilms and its development has been reported for matrix polysaccharides of pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit>  and staphylococcus epidermidis <cit> . furthermore, activity of cell-surface enzymes might be regulated by environmental factors and inside-out signaling without affecting transcription. recently, newell et al.  <cit>  demonstrated a transcription-independent mechanism that regulates biofilm attachment in pseudomonas fluorescens by environmental phosphate and inside-out signaling. overall, the planktonic cells rely on anaerobic metabolism for their energy requirement. furthermore, the down-regulation of energy metabolism-associated genes and the up-regulation of transport-related genes in biofilms suggest that biofilm cells have a reduced energy metabolism and might rely upon the importation of nutrient for their metabolic needs.

stress-related genes are down-regulated in a growing biofilms
given that the biofilm was in its detaching phase at  <dig> h, the transcriptomes of a  <dig> h static biofilm and a  <dig> h static biofilm were also compared to identify probable causes of the dispersal. a total of  <dig> genes  were identified as differentially expressed . based on their functional classification, the largest up-regulated groups were genes associated with transport and energy metabolism . the  <dig> h biofilm was metabolic more active than the 6h biofilm because several anaerobic and glucose metabolism were identified. these include the formate dehydrogenase subunits , anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase  1-phosphofructokinase , and glycerol kinase . the  <dig> h biofilm cells also up-regulate genes transporter for key metabolite in the energy metabolism such as two anaerobic c4-dicarboxylate transporter  and two glycerol-3-phosphate transporter . furthermore, the  <dig> h-biofilm cells appear to be an iron-rich environment given that several genes identified previously were down-regulated  <cit> . these include the transferrin-binding protein gene , the ferric uptake regulator gene , ferritin-like protein gene , haemoglobin-binding protein gene , and the tonb energy system genes . the largest group of down-regulated genes was orfs with unknown role or uncharacterized functions. interestingly, three stress regulators, arca, crp and σe, were down-regulated in a  <dig> h static biofilm . furthermore,  <dig> members of the arca regulon identified by buettner, et al.  <cit>  were differentially expressed in  <dig> h biofilm. the pgaabcd were also down-regulated in a  <dig> h static biofilm but this differential expression is probably controlled by σe. this alternative sigma factor has been shown to control pgaabcd expression  <cit>  and thus our data confirm their observation. another gene of particular interest, apl_ <dig>  was also down-regulated in the 4h biofilm. this gene is predicted to be an autotransporter adhesin. the down-regulation of apl_ <dig> is also interesting because it encodes the autotransporter serine protease aasp. an aasp mutant was unable to form biofilm  <cit> . interestingly, the wecabd  and wzz  genes were up-regulated at 4h and these genes encode proteins involved in biosynthesis of complex carbohydrates such as bacterial common antigen and o-antigens. weca has been shown to play a role in the biofilm formation of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae <cit> .

overall, the functional profile of genes identified as differentially expressed suggest that the biofilm at  <dig> h is healthier and more active metabolically. furthermore, it indicates that the dispersion observed in a  <dig> h biofilm is driven by stress regulators such as arca, crp and σe. the stress initiating the dispersion has yet to be identified but based on the stress regulators, it likely related to a nutritional deficiency in the growth medium. alternatively, a dispersal signal maybe amplified in a closed system.

genes expressed in drip-flow apparatus
bacteria from biofilms cultured using the drip-flow apparatus differentially expressed  <dig> genes  when compared to the effluent bacteria . the largest group of up-regulated genes were those associated with protein synthesis . as observed with static biofilms, one of the major functional category up-regulated in the biofilm was transport-related genes and the largest group of genes down-regulated were those associated with energy metabolism . additionally, the majority of cell envelope associated genes and orfs classified as hypothetical/unclassified/unknown were down-regulated in the biofilm. of particular interest, several membrane protein genes were up-regulated in the biofilm  but several lipoprotein genes were down-regulated . furthermore, the cpxr response regulator gene  was down-regulated in the biofilm. the cpxar two-component system has been associated with regulating the cell envelope composition and biofilm formation  <cit> . the alternative sigma factor, σe, was also down-regulated in a drip-flow biofilm; the expression of its cognate anti-factor, rsea, was unchanged. expression of pgaabcd is controlled by σe as mentioned before  <cit> .

another study has also used microarray technology to dissect the biofilm life style of another bacterium, p. aeruginosa, in a drip-flow assay  <cit> . unlike our study, genes were ranked against markers for particular physiological activities. this allowed the researchers to infer the physiological state of the biofilms and they concluded that the biofilm bacteria were glucose nourished, iron repleted, oxygen limited, and growing slowly or in a stationary-like phase  <cit> . given that there is a lack of transcription study on the physiological activities of a. pleuropneumoniae, it is difficult to make such inferences with our functional classification and cross-referencing analyses. however, the biofilm population appeared to be growing slowly given that energy metabolism-associated genes are down-regulated. metabolism-associated genes and transport-related genes and protein-synthesis genes have also been previously reported as the major down-regulated and up-regulated functional classes in studies relying on microarray hybridizations to characterize gene expression in biofilm population of porphyromonas gingivalis <cit>  and streptococcus pyogenes <cit> . this indicates that a. pleuropneumoniae biofilms behave, in a general sense, similarly to those of other bacterial species. overall, this suggests that biofilm cells have a reduced energy metabolism and might rely upon the importation of nutrient for their metabolic needs; however, the bacteria within the biofilm appear to be highly active in synthesizing proteins.

validation of microarray results by qrt-pcr
to confirm results obtained using the microarrays, five up-regulated genes and five down-regulated genes per experiment were selected for qrt-pcr analysis . the selected genes represented a wide array of log <dig> ratio and in every cases, qrt-pcr results validated the microarray results.

cross-referencing between biofilm conditions
genes differentially expressed in biofilms were cross-referenced to identify genes that were shared among different biofilm conditions . surprisingly, no genes were shared between all three biofilm conditions . both  <dig> h static and  <dig> h static biofilm  had more in common than the drip flow biofilm and the  <dig> h static biofilm  or  <dig> h static biofilm . most genes that were shared among biofilm conditions encoded proteins with unknown role or uncharacterized functions. one set of genes worth noting are the formate dehydrogenase subunit genes, apl_ <dig> and apl_ <dig>  that were down-regulated in  <dig> h and  <dig> h static biofilms. the lack of commonality between biofilms might be due to the fact that each biofilms are in different phase of the biofilm development; the  <dig> h static biofilm is in the growing phase, the  <dig> h static biofilm is in the detaching phase and the  <dig> h drip-flow biofilm is a mature biofilm. the lack of commonality could also be explained by the difference in growth media , atmospheric conditions  and the substrates  between the static biofilms and the drip-flow biofilms.

when the genes identified in the drip-flow experiment were compared to those of the  <dig> h vs  <dig> h static biofilm experiment, several differentially express genes were shared between both conditions . interestingly, two of the stress-related regulators  identified in the  <dig> h vs  <dig> h experiment were not differentially expressed in the drip-flow experiment. furthermore, some genes that were up-regulated in both conditions are ribosomal proteins and a subset of the genes associated with energy metabolism. the majority of the genes that were down-regulated in both conditions encoded proteins with unknown role or uncharacterized functions. however, several of the lipoproteins identified previously were down-regulated in both experiments. furthermore,  <dig> other genes  are worth noting because they encode components of an abc-type transporter; apl_ <dig>  apl_ <dig> and apl_ <dig> encode a maca-like protein, macb-like protein, a tolc-like protein, respectively. an abc transporter has been implicated in the secretion of a dispersin in enteroaggregative e. coli   <cit> . this dispersin is a secreted  <dig> -kda protein encoded by aap  that promotes the dispersal of eaec from surface such as glass and epithelial cells. furthermore, maca and macb have been implicated in the secretion of putisolvin in pseudomonas putida <cit> . putisolvin is a lipopeptide with surface-tension-reducing ability that can inhibit and disperse biofilms of pseudomonas species. overall, this suggests that effluent bacteria from the drip-flow are differently expressing genes related to a naturally detaching biofilm. therefore, a sub-population of the biofilm formed in a drip-flow apparatus appears to undergo a process similar to seeding dispersal. this phenomenon is described as the active detachment process in biofilms that differs from erosion detachment which is passive and shear-mediated  <cit> .

our laboratory recently identified several genetic determinants associated with biofilm formation  <cit>  and these determinants were cross-referenced with genes identified in this transcriptomic study. a total of  <dig> genetic determinants were identified: apl_ <dig>  apl_ <dig>  apl_ <dig> and apl_ <dig>  of the  <dig> genes, apl_ <dig> and apl_ <dig> are the most interesting. apl_ <dig> was down-regulated in the  <dig> h vs 6h experiment and was also down-regulated in the presence of sjpl cells  <cit>  and during the acute phase of a natural infection  <cit> . furthermore, an apl_ <dig> transposon mutant forms more biofilm than the parental strain  <cit> . based on previous observation, we hypothesized that the expression of apl_ <dig> is detrimental to the attachment of a. pleuropneumoniae <cit> . the down-regulation of apl_ <dig> in a growing biofilm fits this hypothesis. apl_ <dig> and its neighbour gene apl_ <dig>  were down-regulated in a  <dig> h biofilm and a apl_ <dig> mutant formed less biofilm than the parental strain  <cit> . in contrast, apl_ <dig> was up-regulated in the  <dig> h static biofilm, in the  <dig> h vs  <dig> h experiment and the drip-flow biofilm. all  <dig> genes encode enzymes involved in riboflavin synthesis. the over-expression of genes associated with riboflavin synthesis during biofilm formation of shewanella oneidensis has been noted before  <cit> . based on these observations, it is reasonable to suggest that the riboflavin synthesis pathway might be important for biofilm formation in a. pleuropneumoniae.

as indicated above, only  <dig> out of the  <dig> genetic determinants identified in a transposon mutant screen were differentially expressed in our biofilm conditions. additionally, h-ns or luxs were not identified as differentially expressed in our transcriptonic study, and arca, aasp, pgaabcd and σe were down-regulated in a growing static biofilm  when compared to a dispersing static biofilm . the absence of several genetic determinants previously identified is puzzling but it is very likely that these determinants play a transient role in biofilm formation or that mutation in those genes have down-stream effect on biofilm formation. the down-regulation of arca, pgaabcd, the anti-sigma e, rsea, and σe was also surprising given that arca and pgac mutants failed to form biofilms and over-expression σe increases biofilm formation  <cit> . the down-regulation of aasp , however, fits with previous observation such as its down-regulation in the presence of sjpl cells  <cit>  and a aasp mutant adhered more to polystyrene  <cit> . therefore, it is likely aasp interfere with adhesion and that the roles arca and σe in biofilm formation are more transient. furthermore, the expression of pgaabcd might be regulated at post-transcriptional level. for example, pgaabcd transcript in e. coli is targeted by rna-binding protein csra and, consequently, increasing the activity of the promoter but reducing pga production  <cit> .

to identify genes that might be involved in host-pathogen interactions and biofilm formation, transcriptomes from this study were cross-referenced with previous transcriptional study performed by our and other laboratories  <cit> . the drip-flow biofilm was the condition that shared the most genes with a natural infection analysis  and an experimental infection analysis . the 4h-static biofilm and the 6h-static biofilm shared  <dig> and  <dig> genes with the natural infection analysis and shared  <dig> and  <dig> genes with the experimental infection analysis. given that the drip-flow transcriptome shared the most genes with the natural and experimental infections transcriptome, this biofilm reactor might be the best model to study biofilm formation of a. pleuropneumonia in vitro. however, there was a poor relationship between the up-regulated and down-regulated genes in the biofilm conditions and the natural infections condition. for example, no genes were up-regulated in the drip-flow biofilm and the natural infection and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in both conditions. there was a better relationship between the genes identified in the transcriptome of a. pleuropneumoniae attached to sjpl cells and biofilm formation. the  <dig> h-static biofilm, the  <dig> h-static biofilm and the drip-flow biofilm shared  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially-expressed genes with the bacteria attached to spjl cells. these included the formate dehydrogenase subunit genes, apl_ <dig>  apl_ <dig> and apl_ <dig>  and these genes were among the genes down-regulated in the static biofilms and cells attached to sjpl cells. the growth condition for the static biofilm and the attachment to sjpl cells share some similarities such as an atmosphere supplemented in 5% co <dig> and the lack of agitation. furthermore, both the adhesion assay  and the biofilm assay  are done over a short period of time. these similarities could explain some of the commonality between the transcriptomes. interestingly, it can, however, indicate that attachment to an abiotic  or a biotic surface  initiate similar changes.

interestingly, apl_ <dig>  which encodes the fine tangled pili,was down-regulated in the drip-flow biofilm and in bacteria attached to sjpl cells  <cit> . this gene was also up-regulated in a natural infection  <cit> , in a growth medium favoring biofilm formation  <cit>  and in a. pleuropneumoniae cultured in the presence of sjpl cells  <cit> . another protein of interest identified in our analysis is the autotransporter adhesin apl_ <dig> which was down-regulated in the  <dig> h vs  <dig> h biofilm experiment. this adhesin is also down-regulated in the presence of epinephrine and up-regulated in the presence of norepinephrine  <cit> . furthermore, a. pleuropneumoniae adhered more to sjpl cells when treated with norepinephrine  <cit> . however, the presence of epinephrine or norepinephrine did not have an effect on biofilm formation  <cit> . differential regulation of apl_ <dig> has also been observed before; apl_ <dig> was up-regulated when a. pleuropneumoniae was cultured in a growth medium favouring biofilm formation  <cit>  and in the presence of porcine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  <cit>  and was down-regulated in a. pleuropneumoniae attached to sjpl cells  <cit> . based on the observations mentioned above, both apl_ <dig> and apl_ <dig> might play a role during early adhesion of a. pleuropneumoniae, more specifically the reversible attachment step of biofilm formation.

CONCLUSIONS
the formation of a static biofilm in a microtiter plate by a. pleuropneumoniae strain s <dig> is a rapid process that reaches its peak by  <dig> h and is fully dispersed by  <dig> h. furthermore, a. pleuropneumoniae can form a robust biofilm under low-shear force in a drip-flow apparatus and this helps to overcome the limitation of a microtiter plate for future biofilm studies. additionally, the dripflow biofilm reactor may represent the better model to study the formation of biofilm by a. pleuropneumoniae. transcriptional analyses also indicated that the formation of a biofilm under low-shear force requires a different sub-set of genes than a biofilm grown under static conditions. candidates involved in early attachment, and dispersion were identified for future work.
