BACKGROUND
during development the cns is vascularized by angiogenesis, in which blood vessels covering the leptomeningeal surface of the brain turn and grow in towards the cns parenchyma  <cit> . ec detach from the growing blood vessels, to proliferate and migrate deeper into the cerebral parenchyma. evidence suggests that the patterns of cerebral angiogenesis are closely matched to the requirements of the surrounding neural tissue. this is well illustrated in the developing cerebral cortex in which emergence of the different neuronal layers is closely followed by the appearance of new blood vessels within each layer  <cit> . this process proceeds in a timely and well-coordinated manner. studies show that cells of the developing cns regulate angiogenesis by secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor   <cit> , and by production of fibronectin along the pathway of migrating endothelial cells  <cit> . more recently, it has been shown that nsc promote vascular tube formation in brain ec in vitro, by a nitric oxide-mediated mechanism  <cit> .

conversely, recent studies have highlighted the role of blood vessels in maintaining the stem cell niche within the cns  <cit> . therefore, communication between ec and neural cells of the developing cns appears to be a two-way street, with each cell type influencing the behaviour of the other. consequently, a better understanding of the molecular signals that mediate these interactions may be important not only for angiogenesis, but also for the maintenance and differentiation of nsc/npc within the cns.

many factors have been implicated in angiogenesis, including the growth factors vegf and bfgf, the ephrins, the angiopoietins  <cit> , and molecules of the ecm, such as fibronectin and laminin  <cit> . interestingly, many of these factors also influence nsc/npc behaviour  <cit> , raising the notion that nsc/npc and ec are both regulated by an evolutionary-conserved set of molecular signals, that help to co-ordinate the establishment and maintenance of the developing cns.

the ecm provides signals that promote ec survival, proliferation, migration and differentiation  <cit> . the major class of ecm receptors are the integrins, which are expressed at the cell surface as noncovalently linked αβ heterodimers  <cit> . within the cns, β <dig> integrins are expressed at high levels by ec  <cit> , and their expression is tightly regulated in different pathological states including stroke, multiple sclerosis and neoplasia  <cit> . an important role for β <dig> integrins in cerebral angiogenesis was suggested by the recent study from this laboratory describing β <dig> integrin expression during postnatal cns development  <cit> . this revealed that brain ec showed a developmental switch in their expression of β <dig> integrins, from predominantly fibronectin receptors  in the early stages of angiogenesis to laminin receptors  in the adult stable state. this suggests that the switch from fibronectin to laminin signalling might be an important factor regulating ec behaviour, switching the cells from an angiogenic phenotype into a more stable differentiated state.

in order to test this idea we recently examined the influence of different ecm proteins on brain ec behaviour in vitro. this showed that fibronectin was the most effective protein at promoting ec survival and proliferation, and that this effect was mediated via the α5β <dig> and αvβ <dig> integrins by a map kinase-dependent signalling pathway  <cit> . this study, like many others, was performed on simple two-dimensional  substrates. in light of the increasing realization that cells within 3-d systems show different modes of behaviour than those in 2-d  <cit> , the aim of the current study was to develop a 3-d system to examine interactions between ec and cells of the developing cns. fluorescent-labelled brain ec were seeded onto neurospheres, free-floating spheres of cells containing predominantly nsc, npc and smaller numbers of differentiated cells. this system models the outside-in ec invasion into the brain that occurs during development  <cit> . in this system, the potential role of β <dig> integrins in mediating ec attachment and migration into neurospheres has been examined.

RESULTS
brain ec attach to neurospheres
the aim of this study was to develop a 3-d system to examine interactions between ec and cells of the developing cns. the neurosphere system was utilized, in which postnatal neural cells are cultured under non-adherent conditions in the presence of the growth factors egf and fgf <dig>  in these cultures, nsc proliferate to form free-floating neurospheres, containing predominantly nsc, npc and smaller numbers of differentiated cells of neuronal or glial lineage  <cit> . as an initial step in this study, primary cultures of mouse brain ec were seeded onto the surface of mouse neurospheres to determine whether ec would attach and migrate into neurospheres, as a means of recapitulating the ec ouside-in invasion of the cns parenchyma that occurs during development.

first, mouse neurospheres were plated in a small volume  of neurosphere media in the centre of wells within a 24-well plate. each drop contained between 20– <dig> neurospheres of size range 80– <dig> μm. neurospheres were used for the first  <dig> passages and then discarded. after leaving the neurospheres  <dig> minutes to settle down on the plastic base, a  <dig> μl single cell suspension containing  <dig>  cell-tracker-labelled mouse brain ec was suspended over the neurospheres. the small volumes were designed to maximise interactions between ec and neurospheres. after  <dig> hours incubation,  <dig>  ml of neurosphere media was gently added to the well, and the plates returned to the incubator. ec adhesion to neurospheres was examined after  <dig> hours co-culture, by observing the living cultures under fluorescent microscopy. as shown in figure  <dig> , after  <dig> hours incubation, it appeared that most neurospheres were covered in fluorescent-labelled ec. to assess the proportion of ec that had attached to neurospheres, the number of attached ec was first counted using fluorescent microscopy. however, this proved very difficult because of the 3-d nature of the culture system and the mobile nature of free-rolling neurospheres. therefore ec attachment to neurospheres was assessed in an alternative approach by quantifying the number ec that did not attach to neurospheres. this was achieved by first, removing all neurospheres and ec from the non-adherent plates into a centrifuge tube and allowing the neurospheres to separate out by gravity. next, the number of ec in the remaining supernatant was counted using a haemocytometer. this showed that of the  <dig>  ec added to the neurosphere cultures,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % had not attached to a neurosphere . in an additional approach the number of fluorescent-labelled ec that attached to neurospheres was also quantified by flow cytometry. in this approach, the sedimented neurospheres containing attached ec were dissociated with trypsin into a single cell suspension before analysis by flow cytometry to quantify the absolute number of fluorescent-labelled ec present within the cell population. this showed that of the original  <dig>  ec plated onto the neurospheres  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  had attached to a neurosphere. these results are largely consistent and show that approximately one-third of the originally-plated ec attach to the neurospheres under the conditions in this assay system.

the co-cultures were maintained for a further  <dig> days to assess whether the attached ec would survive for longer periods. this was important to establish because the ec-neurosphere co-cultures were maintained in serum-free media, so as to prevent nsc/npc adhesion and differentiation, and ec do not normally survive in serum-free conditions  <cit> . however, as illustrated in figure  <dig> , after  <dig> days culture, many ec still remained attached to neurospheres, showing that in this system, ec do survive in the absence of serum. this suggests that ec in contact with neurospheres obtain sufficient pro-survival signals, most likely as a result of their strong adhesion to neurospheres, and from pro-survival factors released from the nsc/npc within the neurospheres.

brain ec migrate into neurospheres
having established that ec can attach to neurospheres and survive for periods of up to  <dig> days, the next aim was to determine whether ec actively migrated into neurospheres, or just remained superficially attached to the neurosphere surface. to examine this, fresh frozen sections of  <dig> day-old ec-neurosphere co-cultures were analysed for the distribution of fluorescent-labelled ec within the neurospheres. as shown in figure  <dig>  many fluorescent-labelled ec were detected within neurospheres, and these cells were distributed not just at the edge of the neurospheres, but throughout the entire neurosphere structure. to examine how effectively ec migrate into neurospheres, the number of ec within neurospheres was determined by counting the number of fluoresecent-labelled ec in  <dig> different  <dig> μm sections of the ec-neurosphere co-cultures, each containing between 10– <dig> neurospheres. as shown in figure 2e, this showed that the majority of neurospheres contained ec, though approximately 25% of neurospheres contained no ec. the observation that some neurospheres contained absolutely no ec, even at the neurosphere surface, supports the idea that ec failed to contact these neurospheres in the original plating procedure. to gain some idea of the survival rate of ec within this co-culture system, a calculation was performed based on the cell counts of ec within co-culture sections. in light of the observation that within this system the average neurosphere diameter was  <dig> μm, it was estimated that by counting ec in  <dig> sections of  <dig> μm each, this would include all ec present. using this calculation, it was determined that over the course of three separate experiments, that of the  <dig>  ec originally co-cultured with neurospheres,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % ec survived up to day  <dig> of the experiment. in light of the observation that neurospheres are capable of fusing in culture  <cit> , it is possible that the appearance of ec within neurospheres could be explained by neurosphere fusion and incorporation of the surface-attached ec into the centre of aggregated neurospheres. to exclude the possibility that this might be the reason for detecting ec within neurospheres, single neurospheres were plated into the centre of wells within 24-well tissue culture plates and then seeded with fluorescent-labelled ec. subsequent analysis of frozen sections by fluorescent microscopy revealed that fluorescent-labelled ec were detected throughout the neurospheres plated as single neurospheres, confirming that ec migrate readily through neurospheres.

when the morphology of the fluorescent-labelled ec inside neurospheres was examined , it was noticed that ec were often grouped together in small aggregates, and in a small number of cases, the ec had formed linear groups of cells, reminiscent of those observed during the early stages of vascular development in the cns  <cit> . these linear groups of ec were never found in the early stages of ec-neurosphere co-culture, and only became apparent after  <dig> days culture. because some studies have reported that nsc within neurospheres can differentiate into ec  <cit> , next, expression of the endothelial-specific marker cd <dig>  was examined by immunofluorescence. this showed that cells within neurospheres not containing any fluoresecent-labelled ec did not express cd <dig>  however in neurospheres receiving ec, cd31-positive cells were distributed throughout the neurospheres, and in some cases the cd31-positive cells showed a linear vascular-like appearance . furthermore, cd31-positive cells negative for the fluorescent cell-tracker label were never detected, suggesting that nsc/npc within the neurosphere did not differentiate into ec.

neurospheres express the ecm proteins fibronectin and laminin
a previous report from this laboratory demonstrated that brain ec express integrin receptors for fibronectin and laminin  <cit> . to address whether these two ecm proteins are expressed within neurospheres, immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen neurospheres, using polyclonal antibodies specific for fibronectin and laminin. this showed that both ecm ligands were expressed within neurospheres . fibronectin was expressed throughout neurospheres, with a pattern that outlined individual cell bodies of the neurosphere. laminin was expressed in an intricate fibrillar pattern, outlining cell processes between cells. interestingly, while fibronectin expression was distributed throughout the neurosphere structure, laminin expression was highest on cells within the core of neurospheres.

integrins promote ec attachment to neurospheres
this study has demonstrated that primary mouse brain ec attach, migrate and survive within mouse neurospheres, thus validating this system as a tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms mediating interactions between ec and nsc/npc within the developing cns. the specific focus of this research group is to understand the role of integrins in regulating ec behaviour within the cns. previously our studies demonstrated a developmental switch in ec integrins, from fibronectin-mediated signalling during the early stages of angiogenesis, to laminin-mediated signalling during endothelial differentiation  <cit> . to extend this work, the next set of studies were designed to test the hypothesis that β <dig> integrins provide important instructional cues that drive the early events of angiogenesis in the cns, such as ec adhesion and migration into the developing cns.

to investigate the importance of integrins in mediating adhesive interactions between ec and neurospheres, the impact of integrin function-blocking reagents on ec attachment to neurospheres was evaluated. fluorescent-labelled ec were added to cultures of neurospheres in the presence of the different function-blocking reagents: control dgr peptide, blocking peptide rgd , isotype control antibody, anti-β <dig> integrin antibody , or the anti-α <dig> integrin antibody, goh <dig>  as before,  <dig> μl containing  <dig>  fluoresecent-labelled ec was suspended over a  <dig> μl drop containing 20– <dig> neurospheres of size range 80– <dig> μm. after  <dig> hours culture the effect of integrin blockade on ec adhesion to neurospheres was quantified, by first, measuring the proportion of ec that remained unattached to ns and second, by flow cytometry of the neurosphere population to quantify the number of fluoresecent-labelled ec that had attached to neurospheres. as shown in figure  <dig>  when compared to control conditions, ec attachment to neurospheres was significantly inhibited both by the rgd peptides  and by the pan-β <dig> integrin antibody , but not by the control dgr peptides, isotype-control antibody or by the anti-α <dig> antibody. flow cytometric analysis yielded very similar results . taken together, these results suggest that ec attachment to neurospheres is dependent on the fibronectin-binding α5β <dig> integrin but not the laminin-binding α6β <dig> integrin.

discussion
in this study a novel 3-d co-culture system to study the interactions between brain ec and neural cells of the developing cns is presented. using neurospheres as a model of the developing cns, brain ec were seeded onto neurospheres in an attempt to mimic the outside-in ec invasion into the cns that occurs during development  <cit> . the studies demonstrate that ec attach, migrate and survive inside neurospheres. in addition, to investigate the potential role of integrins in promoting the early stages of cerebral angiogenesis, the studies revealed that neurospheres express fibronectin and laminin, the appropriate ecm ligands for ec β <dig> integrins, and that ec attachment to neurospheres is mediated by the α5β <dig> integrin.

angiogenesis has become intensely studied because of its involvement in many pathological processes, particularly neoplasia  <cit> . in the cns, angiogenesis is an important part of normal development  <cit> , but it also occurs in a number of pathological conditions in the adult cns, including arteriovenous malformations   <cit> , neoplastic conditions  <cit> , and cerebral ischaemia  <cit> . therefore an improved understanding of the molecular events that underlie brain angiogenesis is of high priority. the growing realization that cells behave differently in 2-d versus 3-d environments  <cit>  has led many to believe that it may be more informative to study ec behaviour in 3-d rather than 2-d systems. to address this, many studies have used matrigel, fibrin or collagen 3-d gels to try and create a more complex 3-d environment  <cit> . however the drawback of these approaches is that while they are 3-d, they may be too simplistic, containing only one or two ecm proteins, and do not contain other cell types that may be important for orchestrating angiogenesis during development. the novel 3-d co-culture system described in this study may be a significant step forward for several reasons. first, the neurosphere system provides a simple 3-d model of the developing cns, containing the major cell types present within the developing cns at the time of angiogenesis, including nsc, npc and other more differentiated cells  <cit> . second, unlike culture systems that use postnatal astrocytes  <cit> , the majority of neural cells within the neurosphere are at an immature stage of development, thus closely mimicking the environmental cues that migrating ec will encounter as they start to invade the developing cns  <cit> . third, unlike the complexity of the developing in vivo situation, the ec-neurosphere co-culture model is relatively easy to establish, and is amenable to manipulation and analysis.

this 3-d system could be used to address several different fundamental questions relating to interactions between ec and nsc/npc. first, it could be used to investigate the influence of ec on nsc/npc maintenance, proliferation and differentiation. in light of the notion that blood vessels may be an important component of the stem cell niche  <cit> , and the findings by temple et al  <cit> , that ec promote nsc proliferation and induce nsc differentiation along the neuronal pathway, it will be interesting to investigate this influence in the 3-d system presented here. second, it could be used to investigate the influence of nsc/npc on ec behaviour and thus angiogenesis. previous data shows that neurons, astrocytes and nsc produce soluble factors that promote angiogenesis  <cit> . the system presented here would be a valuable tool for characterising nsc/npc factors involved in this regulation. third, it provides a good system to examine the role of specific candidate molecules in regulating the different stages of brain angiogenesis. in the work presented here, it is demonstrated that the fibronectin-α5β <dig> integrin interaction is important for the initial ec adhesion to neurospheres. in future studies this avenue will be extended by using ec derived from integrin null mice and sirna to examine the role of individual integrins and key components of the integrin-associated intracellular signalling pathways. in this initial study it was noted that while ec attach and migrate into the body of neurospheres, the actual degree of vascular tube formation after  <dig> days co-culture under baseline conditions was relatively small. in future work, the ability of well-described angiogenic factors such as bfgf  <cit>  or tgf-β <dig>  <cit>  to promote vascular tube formation will be evaluated in this system.

this 3-d system was used to explore the role of ecm-integrin interactions in regulating some of the early events mediating brain angiogenesis. importantly, it was found that ec attached rapidly and migrated into the centre of neurospheres. previously we have shown that in the developing cns, ec switch from a predominantly fibronectin signalling pathway  to a laminin signalling pathways   <cit> . in keeping with the observations of others  <cit>  the work presented here confirms that both fibronectin and laminin are expressed by neural cells within the neurosphere, thus providing the ecm ligands for ec integrins to interact with. interestingly, while fibronectin was expressed throughout the neurospheres, laminin expression was focussed preferentially at the centre of neurospheres. in addition, function-blocking studies showed that the α5β <dig> integrin, a fibronectin receptor, is important in promoting ec attachment to neurospheres. this is consistent with the observation that ec migrating from the brain surface into the parenchyma during development are in close contact with a fibronectin-rich matrix  <cit> , and also from our previous work showing that fibronectin-mediated interactions are dominant in the early stages of cerebral angiogenesis  <cit> . taken together, these findings suggest that fibronectin-mediated events play an important role in the early stages of ec adhesion and migration in the developing cns.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel 3-d system for investigating interactions between ec and nsc/npc is presented. when plated onto neurospheres, brain ec attached, survived and migrated into neurospheres. this system could be used to investigate the reciprocal influence of ec and nsc/npc; to examine how nsc/npc influence cerebral angiogenesis, and conversely, to examine how ec regulate the maintenance and differentiation of nsc/npc. here, this system has been used to show that ec attachment to neurospheres is mediated by the fibronectin receptor, α5β <dig> integrin.
