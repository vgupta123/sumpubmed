BACKGROUND
leptin is an adipocyte-secreted hormone that acts on hypothalamic centers in the brain to control the energy balance of the body  <cit> . leptin deficiency of humans or rodents results in hyperphagia and morbid obesity. in patients with genetic leptin deficiency, therapy with exogenous leptin effectively suppresses hyperphagia and corrects metabolic and other abnormalities  <cit> . however, in most cases of obesity levels of circulating leptin are high, implying a state of resistance to the weight-reducing effect of leptin. consequently, clinical trials using recombinant leptin for the pharmacological treatment of obesity yielded disappointing results  <cit> . leptin resistance in rodents can be induced by short-term voluntary overfeeding  <cit> , by feeding high-fat diet  <cit> , and by chronically elevated leptin levels  <cit> . reduced leptin sensitivity is also a physiological mechanism to allow anticipatory energy intake and storage of nutrients, e.g. during pregnancy or in hibernators  <cit> . mechanisms of leptin resistance include failure of circulating leptin to reach its targets in the brain, inhibition of the intracellular leptin signaling cascade, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and antagonism of the physiological actions of leptin downstream from the primary target cell of leptin  <cit> . regardless of the relative contributions of these mechanisms, it is clear that the ability of leptin to activate intracellular signaling pathways is decreased by high chronic blood levels of leptin  <cit> . however, the mechanisms underlying the leptin-induced state of reduced leptin sensitivity are not yet understood at the molecular level.

the leptin receptor belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily and exists in several splicing variants. leptin binding to the long leptin receptor isoform  activates cytokine-like signal transduction via the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription  pathway. leptin stimulation leads to the activation of jaks that are constitutively associated with leprb and in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the receptor  <cit> . the phosphorylated tyrosines  provide docking sites for proteins with src homology  <dig>  domains. ptyr <dig>  recruits the tyrosine phosphatase shp <dig>  which mediates the activation of the ras/raf/erk pathway, whereas the stat proteins bind to ptyr <dig>  and ptyr <dig>  . the bound stat factors are phosphorylated by the receptor-associated jak kinases, dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to control transcription of specific target genes. leprb-induced stat <dig> activation is essential for leptin regulation of energy balance  <cit> .

although shp <dig> has tyrosine phosphatase activity, its overexpression or knockdown only marginally alters the levels of leptin-induced stat <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . multiple studies support roles for two inhibitory proteins, suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig>  and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1b , as negative regulators of leptin signaling. the level of ptp1b expression modulates leprb signaling in cell lines and in vivo  <cit> , and its upregulation by leptin implies a function as a negative feedback regulator  <cit> . numerous studies have demonstrated that the upregulation of socs <dig> by leptin contributes to the attenuation of leprb signaling in vivo and in cultured cells  <cit> . socs <dig> suppresses cytokine signaling by inhibiting the receptor-associated jak kinase  <cit>  or by targeting bound signaling proteins for proteasomal degradation  <cit> . optimal inhibition of jaks occurs when socs <dig> is recruited to cytokine receptor complexes via binding to specific phosphotyrosine motifs  was sufficient for the attenuation of stat <dig> activation, and that either tyrosine residue can support the suppression of leprb signaling by socs <dig>  finally, we show that the receptor-associated jak kinase has reduced stat-phosphorylating activity after two hours of continuous receptor stimulation. however, the kinase is not dephosphorylated or degraded, and the inhibition of activity depends on the presence of tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> in leprb.

RESULTS
attenuation of leptin-induced stat <dig> activation depends on the presence of either tyr <dig> or tyr1077
to examine the role of tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> in the attenuation of leprb signaling during prolonged ligand stimulation, we determined the kinetics of leptin-induced stat <dig> tyrosine phosphorylation in rinm5f cells. we have previously established the insulinoma cell line rinm5f as a model system to define the differential effects of the intracellular tyrosines in leprb signal transduction and their effects on gene expression  <cit> . we used rinm5f subclones expressing wild type  leprb or mutant receptor construct in which one or both of these tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanine. the presence of tyr <dig> in the mutant receptors allowed us to monitor stat <dig> tyrosine phosphorylation as the principle downstream signaling event. as shown in figure  <dig>  continuous treatment of rinm5f-leprb-wt cells with leptin resulted in a maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of stat <dig> from  <dig> -  <dig> min, after which the level of the phosphorylated stat <dig> declined sharply but remained detectable at reduced levels for  <dig> h. mutation of neither tyr <dig> nor tyr <dig> in leprb-fyy and leprb-yfy abrogated the attenuation of leprb signaling. stat <dig> activation by the leprb double mutant lacking both tyr <dig> and tyr <dig>  did not decline during the 4-h treatment with leptin. similar time courses of stat <dig> phosphorylation were observed in hit-t <dig> cells transiently expressing wild type and mutant leprb constructs .

leptin induces expression of socs <dig> but not socs <dig> in rinm5f cells
we determined the surface expression of leprb in untreated and leptin-treated rinm5f cells to examine whether leptin signaling was downregulated by receptor internalization and/or degradation. after  <dig> h of leptin treatment, binding assays showed only a weakly reduced leptin binding to the cell surface, which could not account for the reduced stat <dig> phosphorylation . next we used the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin d, to reveal whether active gene expression was required for feedback inhibition. as shown in figure 2b, treatment with actinomycin d prevented the decrease of leptin-induced stat <dig> phosphorylation over time. a similar result was obtained by treatment with cycloheximide . these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that leprb signaling in rinm5f cells is attenuated by the upregulation of socs family proteins. therefore, we examined whether leptin induced the expression of socs <dig> and socs <dig> in rinm5f cells. as previously observed in other cell lines , leptin induced a rapid upregulation of socs <dig> mrna levels within  <dig> h but did not affect the expression of socs <dig> . however, socs <dig> mrna was upregulated in response to il-1β or the simultaneous application of leptin and il-1β. we tested this combination of cytokines because we had previously shown that il-1β enhanced the expression of several leptin-induced genes in rinm5f cells  <cit> . in contrast to a previous study in rinm5f cells  <cit> , we observed no upregulation of socs <dig> mrna by il-1β. consistent with previous reports that the transcription of the socs <dig> gene is regulated by stat <dig>  tyr <dig> was sufficient for the induction of socs <dig> expression in rinm5f cells . thus, the leprb constructs used throughout this study were fully capable of inducing the expression of socs <dig> 

inhibition of leprb point mutants by socs <dig> and socs1
next we analyzed the roles of tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> in the negative regulation of leprb signaling with the help of stat3-dependent reporter gene assays. these assays were performed in the hepatoma cell line hepg <dig> to allow for ensuing knockdown experiments with shrna vectors directed against human socs <dig> and socs <dig> . as shown in figure 4a, mutation of tyr <dig>  caused a twofold increase of leptin-induced reporter gene activity, consistent with the known function of this tyrosine as a docking site for socs <dig>  significantly higher luciferase activity was induced by the mutant receptor lacking both tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> , indicating that tyr <dig> also plays a role in the negative regulation of leprb→stat <dig> signaling. however, mutation of tyr <dig> alone did not affect promoter activity .

to determine the requirement of tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> for the inhibitory effects of socs proteins, we studied the effects of socs <dig> and socs <dig> overexpression on the activation of the stat3-dependent promoter by the leprb mutants. both socs proteins were expressed from the same vector and at comparable levels , allowing us to directly compare the inhibitory potencies of socs <dig> and socs <dig> on leptin-induced promoter activation. the expression level of the socs proteins was carefully titrated to attain a submaximal degree of inhibition.

transfection of socs <dig> expression plasmid resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of luciferase activity induced by wild type leprb in hepg <dig> cells . mutation of tyr <dig> in leprb-fyy reduced but did not prevent the inhibitory effect of socs <dig>  in contrast, leprb-ffy was largely resistant to socs <dig> overexpression and was only weakly inhibited by the highest expression levels of socs <dig>  this result provides evidence that socs <dig> inhibits leprb signaling not only by binding to tyr <dig> but also to tyr <dig>  a similar result was obtained in the hamster insulinoma cell line hit-t <dig>  although leprb-fyy and leprb-ffy differed in their sensitivity to socs <dig> only at higher expression levels .

overexpressed socs <dig> inhibited wild type leprb as efficiently as socs <dig> . unexpectedly, socs <dig> had a significantly weaker inhibitory effect on leprb-fyy than on the wild type receptor, suggesting that socs <dig> exerts its effect partially by binding to ptyr <dig>  in contrast to socs <dig>  socs <dig> inhibited leprb-fyy and leprb-ffy with the same potency.

knockdown experiments
we performed knockdown experiments to address whether endogenous levels of socs <dig> suffice to inhibit leprb signaling via binding to ptyr <dig>  endogenous socs <dig> accumulated to higher levels after stimulation of leprb-ffy than leprb-fyy, confirming that tyr <dig> contributes to the negative regulation of the effects of leptin on gene expression. expression of a socs3-directed shrna reduced the expression of leptin-induced socs <dig> below the limits of detection . promoter activation by wild type leprb was enhanced 5-fold by knockdown of socs <dig> expression , indicating that the negative feedback through socs <dig> plays a critical role in the modulation of the leptin response in hepg <dig> cells. promoter activation by leprb-fyy was also significantly enhanced by knockdown of socs <dig>  indicating that tyr <dig> is not essential for the inhibitory effect of socs <dig>  in contrast, the activity of leprb-ffy was not altered by the knockdown plasmid, suggesting that tyr <dig> must be responsible for the inhibitory effect of socs <dig> on leprb-fyy. knockdown of socs <dig> expression increased leprb-induced promoter activity only by approximately 50%  since socs <dig> is not induced by leptin . consistent with the above observation that the effect of socs <dig> was partially dependent on receptor tyrosine motifs, knockdown of socs <dig> did not further enhance the activity of leprb-ffy. however, the difference between the mutant receptor construct did not reach statistical significance.

jak <dig> inhibition during downregulation of leprb signaling is not correlated with dephosphorylation
socs <dig> and socs <dig> harbor kir domains that are thought to suppress jak kinase activity by acting as substrate mimetics  <cit> . we designed an assay to determine the stat-phosphorylating activity of the jak kinase in leprb receptor complexes. immunoprecipitated receptor complexes were incubated with recombinant stat <dig> in the presence of atp, and tyrosine phosphorylation of stat <dig> was determined by western blot analysis with an antibody specific for ptyr <dig> . stat <dig> was used as a substrate because recombinant stat <dig> was not commercially available at that time, and because stat <dig> is also activated by leptin in rinm5f cells  <cit> . similar to stat <dig>  tyrosine phosphorylation of the endogenous stat <dig> in the lysates of the rinm5f- cells was reduced to near background levels after  <dig> h of leptin treatment but remained detectable in the leprb-ffy expressing cells . surprisingly, the phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the activation loop of jak <dig>  was not reduced at this time point, and no difference in jak phosphorylation between wt and mutant leprb was observed. however, stat1-phosphorylating activity of the wt leprb complex was markedly reduced after  <dig> h leptin treatment. in contrast, kinase activity remained constant in the leprb-ffy complexes. this result suggests that i) leprb signaling during chronic receptor stimulation is downregulated at the level of jak activity, ii) kinase activity does not correlate with the phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the activation loop of the receptor-associated jak kinase, and iii) the downregulation of leptin signaling depends on the presence of tyr <dig> and/or tyr <dig> in leprb.

discussion
in the present study we have deciphered the roles of the intracellular tyrosines for the attenuation of leprb signaling, in particular for the inhibitory effects of socs <dig> and socs <dig>  and provide new evidence regarding the mechanism by which leprb signaling is terminated during chronic stimulation.

role of tyr1077
we present a series of results documenting that tyr <dig> has a role in the negative regulation of leprb:  the presence of either tyr <dig> or tyr <dig> in the cytoplasmic domain of leprb is sufficient for the attenuation of leptin-induced stat <dig> phosphorylation .  leprb-ffy induces significantly higher reporter gene activity in hepg <dig> cells than leprb-fyy , suggesting that tyr <dig> contributes to negative regulation of leptin-induced gene expression. a similar effect has been observed in the neuronal pc <dig> cell line  <cit>  but neither in hek <dig> cells  <cit>  nor our previous study of hit-t <dig> insulinoma cells  <cit> . the cell type specificity may be due to varying expression levels of other signaling molecules that compete for binding to ptyr <dig>  such as stat <dig>  socs <dig> or cis  <cit> .  the inhibitory effect of socs <dig> was reduced but still clearly present in the absence of tyr <dig> , whereas the mutation of both tyr <dig> and tyr <dig>  rendered leprb largely resistant to the inhibitory effect of socs <dig> . this result contrasts with that of bjørbaek et al.  <cit> , which suggested that overexpressed socs <dig> failed to inhibit stat3-dependent reporter gene activity mediated by a tyr <dig> mutant leprb construct. this difference may be attributed to the use of erythropoietin receptor-leprb chimeras in that study, or more likely, to the different cell systems used. consistent with the results obtained in  <dig> cells by bjørbaek et al.  <cit> , we show that socs <dig> inhibited leprb-fyy in hit-t <dig> cells only at the highest levels of expression .  the knockdown experiments show clearly that endogenous levels of socs <dig> are sufficient for the inhibition of leprb→stat <dig> signaling via ptyr <dig> in hepg <dig> cells . whereas reporter gene activity stimulated by leprb-fyy was significantly enhanced by knockdown of socs <dig>  this was not the case for the double mutant . thus, the inhibitory effect of endogenous socs <dig> is strictly dependent on the presence of either tyr <dig> or tyr <dig>   finally, leprb-ffy induced higher levels of socs <dig> than leprb-fyy , confirming that the enhanced stat <dig> activation translates into increased expression of an endogenous gene, not just the exogenous reporter construct.

taken together, these results establish a role of ptyr <dig> in the negative regulation of the leprb receptor complex, thus extending the prevailing view that tyr <dig> is critical for the negative feedback regulation of leptin signaling. de souza et al.  <cit>  have determined affinities of  <dig>  μm and  <dig> μm for the binding of socs <dig> to phosphopeptides corresponding to regions surrounding and tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> of leprb. binding to ptyr <dig> in leprb was thus somewhat weaker than to ptyr <dig>  much weaker than to ptyr <dig> in the gp <dig> receptor , but stronger than to the socs <dig> binding site of the erythropoietin receptor .

the capacity of tyr <dig> to substitute for the mutated tyr <dig> provides an explanation for the tyr985-independent attenuation of leptin signaling observed by dunn et al.  <cit> . furthermore, this role for tyr <dig> may also explain why mice homozygous for a knock-in mutation of tyr <dig> leprb display a relatively weak phenotype  <cit> , as compared to mice with the corresponding mutation in the il- <dig> cytokine family receptor signaling subunit glycoprotein  <dig> . the disruption of the negative feedback on gp130-dependent stat signaling causes stat <dig> hyperactivation, and these mice develop a broad spectrum of hematopoietic abnormalities, including splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, thrombocytosis and autoimmune arthritis  <cit> . in contrast, although homozygous leprleu <dig> mice display a phenotype of increased leptin sensitivity, the effect of this mutation was only significant in females and under conditions of high fat diet  <cit> . this mild phenotype is likely due to the negative feedback regulation through tyr <dig>  which partially compensates for the mutation of tyr <dig> 

socs <dig> inhibits leprb signaling
we have shown by direct comparisons that socs <dig> inhibits leprb→stat <dig> signaling as potently as socs <dig>  furthermore, our results challenge the prevailing view that socs <dig> inhibits jak kinases by directly binding to the activation loop, independent of receptor phosphotyrosine motifs  <cit> . even at low expression levels, socs <dig> inhibited wild type leprb more efficiently than leprb-fyy and leprb-ffy . this is not the first report that socs <dig> requires binding to a receptor chain tyrosine for its inhibitory effect. the inhibition of interferon-γ signaling by socs <dig> has been shown to depend strictly on the presence of tyr <dig> in the interferon-γ receptor subunit  <dig>  <cit> . a similar observation has been reported for the g-csf receptor in which tyr <dig> is required for the inhibitory action of both socs <dig> and socs <dig>  <cit> . this result was challenged by a later study in which only the inhibitory effect of socs <dig> but not socs <dig> depended on the presence of tyr <dig>  <cit> . however, these seemingly conflicting data may be attributed to the different cell types used and/or to varying levels of socs overexpression. because high levels of protein expression can conceal potential differences in the avidity of binding sites, we took care to study the effects of the socs proteins on leprb at expression levels that cause only partial inhibition of reporter gene activity. we conclude from our data that the inhibitory effect of socs <dig> on leprb in hepg <dig> cells is strongly enhanced by the presence of the tyr <dig> phosphotyrosine motif. socs <dig> is less dependent than socs <dig> on this binding site , consistent with the higher affinity of jak <dig> for the socs <dig> vs. socs <dig> sh <dig> domain  <cit> . notably, the requirement of docking sites for the actions of socs <dig> and socs <dig> may differ between different cytokine receptors. a recent study has revealed that the feedback inhibition of the oncostatin m receptor by socs <dig> was independent of phosphotyrosine motifs in the receptor chain, whereas the same levels socs <dig> did not inhibit gp <dig> in the absence of tyr <dig>  <cit> . hence, differences in requirement of recruitment sites, in addition to differences in the induction by various cytokines and different kinetics of induction  <cit> , critically determine the modulatory effects of socs <dig> and socs <dig> on cytokine receptor signaling. further analyses will be necessary to characterize the binding of socs <dig> to ptyr <dig> and reveal the physiological consequence of this interaction for the function of leprb.

the inhibitory effect of socs <dig> on leprb signaling has not previously been analyzed as a mechanism of leptin resistance, because leptin does not induce expression of socs <dig> . however, socs <dig> may inhibit leprb as a consequence of crosstalk between signaling pathways  rather than as a feedback mechanism. interestingly, socs <dig> has been reported to be upregulated in adipose tissue in two different models of obesity associated with leptin resistance  <cit> . in the arcuate nucleus, steroid hormone dependent upregulation of socs <dig> contributes to prolactin resistance in late pregnancy  <cit> , and may also contribute to the reduced leptin responsiveness in pregnancy. it remains to be determined whether upregulation of socs <dig> by other pathways plays a part in central or peripheral leptin resistance.

jak inhibition
cytokine receptors are subject to downregulation by a variety of mechanisms, such as internalization, dephosphorylation and degradation. here we have focused on the mechanism by which stat activation through leprb is quickly attenuated within two hours of continuous leptin stimulation. as previously observed in cho cells  <cit> , leprb surface expression was not significantly reduced after two hours . this result is consistent with the previous observation that presence or the absence of leptin did not alter the internalization rate of leprb  <cit> . therefore, we asked whether the stat phosphorylating activity of the receptor complex was altered after two hours of leptin treatment. indeed, we observed markedly reduced activity of the jak kinase associated with wild type leprb but not leprb-ffy. our experimental approach allowed us to exclude several other potential mechanisms of receptor inactivation.  the receptor-associated jak molecules were not dephosphorylated at this time point, excluding the possibility that tyrosine phosphatases, in particular ptp1b or shp- <dig>  are responsible for the fast inactivation of the jak kinases. this result implies that the phosphorylation state of the jaks is not a reliable measure of the catalytic activity, at least when the inactivation kinetics is concerned.  the fact that the amounts of the receptor chain and the jak kinase were not reduced after  <dig> h of leptin treatment suggests that the attenuation of leprb signaling is not a consequence of socs- triggered degradation of the receptor or the associated kinase  <cit> . moreover, termination of stat phosphorylation is not caused by the dissociation of the jak molecules from the receptor complex, a mechanism previously described for the receptors for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin and growth hormone  <cit> .  the direct measurement of the reduced jak activity in the isolated receptor complex excludes the possibility that the decrease of stat tyrosine phosphorylation is exclusively determined by the rate of stat dephosphorylation . the dephosphorylation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> must occur rapidly to allow for the fast termination of leptin signaling, but the downregulation of jak activity is required to achieve the net reduction of stat tyrosine phosphorylation and activation.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we conclude from the available evidence and our present results that the first step in the attenuation of leprb→stat <dig> signaling in cells chronically stimulated by leptin occurs through the fast upregulation of the negative feedback regulator socs <dig>  socs <dig> is recruited to either ptyr <dig> or ptyr <dig> in the receptor chain and inhibits the receptor-associated jak molecules by direct interaction of its kinase inhibitory region  with the activation loop of the kinase. the next step is putatively the dephosphorylation of the jak molecules and/or the receptor, which is a fast event in some cell systems  but was separable from the initial inhibition of jak activity in our experiments. other mechanisms of negative regulation may play a role at later stages and contribute to the state of reduced leptin responsiveness induced by chronic leptin stimulation.
