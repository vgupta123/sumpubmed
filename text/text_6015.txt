BACKGROUND
genetic maps provide specific positions of genetic markers, which are required for performing genetic studies. linkage analyses, which aim to identify genetic loci related to human phenotypes and complex diseases, have been performed with caucasian genetic maps even in asian populations, because no comprehensive asian genetic maps with dense markers have yet been introduced. since multipoint methods are frequently used in linkage analyses, it is important to use correct maps for the population being studied  <cit> .

distance between adjacent genetic markers in genetic maps is calculated from average recombination rates between markers during meiosis with map functions. the kosambi map function is widely used nowadays.

genetic mapping was first introduced using restriction fragment length polymorphism  markers  <cit> , followed by genome-wide human genetic maps with more informative microsatellite markers. the genethon  <cit>  and marshfield  <cit>  maps were created from eight ceph families  <cit> , using  <dig> and  <dig> genetic markers, respectively, but few  meioses. the decode map utilized  <dig> meioses in  <dig> icelandic families with  <dig> markers  <cit> . in addition, several combined genetic maps were generated based on the ceph and icelandic populations  <cit> .

other than for caucasians, however, there are few human genetic maps for different ethnic groups. although genetic maps of four different ethnic groups  were recently constructed, the number of markers was quite small  and the maps were constructed based on nuclear families  <cit> . misspecification of genetic maps may reduce the power of linkage analyses  <cit> , and different ethnic groups may have different recombination rates  <cit> . therefore, separate genetic maps for asian populations are needed to investigate the asian genome more precisely.

we constructed an asian genetic map with  <dig> microsatellite markers using  <dig> genotyped individuals in  <dig> large mongolian families. this study was undertaken as a part of gendiscan  project. the construction of an asian genetic map may be applicable to further linkage studies of asian ethnic groups as well as to understanding the genomic variations between asians and caucasians with megabase resolution.

we genotyped  <dig> families, consisting of  <dig> family members and a total of  <dig> meioses. among the  <dig> family members,  <dig> were genotyped and  <dig> meioses became available for investigation. considering the heterozygosity of the  <dig> microsatellite markers genotyped in this study,  <dig> to  <dig> informative meioses of each marker  were obtained using crimap software  <cit> . only  <dig> markers  showed fewer than  <dig> informative meioses.

the gendiscan map shows the genetic positions of the markers, both sex-averaged and sex-specific, along with the physical positions. a summary of the map is presented in table  <dig>  the physical lengths of the chromosomes are also included. the gendiscan map covers  <dig>  mb, which is  <dig> % of the human genome assembly build  <dig> . when we excluded the telomeric heterochromatic regions, which have a wide range of sequencing gaps in especially acrocentric chromosomes , the coverage increases to  <dig> %.

we compared our gendiscan map with the rutgers map v. <dig>  one of the most accurate genetic maps of caucasians  and including  <dig> polymorphic markers, with an average of  <dig> informative meioses  <cit> . among the  <dig> markers shown in the gendiscan map, we were able to determine the genetic positions of  <dig> microsatellite markers common to both the gendiscan and rutgers map v. <dig>  from rutgers map v. <dig>  the genetic positions of the remaining  <dig> markers, which are not present in rutgers map v. <dig>  were estimated by an interpolation considering the physical positions of the markers from human genome assembly build  <dig> .

the sex-averaged, female and male whole genome lengths were  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively, which are  <dig> â€“ 9% shorter than the respective genome lengths of rutgers map v. <dig> . the genetic lengths of chromosomes of the sex-averaged, female and male maps are illustrated in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. all chromosomal lengths of the gendiscan map were shorter than those of the rutgers map v. <dig> except for male chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and sex-averaged chromosome  <dig>  paired t-tests demonstrated significant differences between the whole genome and chromosome genetic lengths . the whole genome and chromosome  <dig> lengths of all three types of gendiscan map were significantly shorter than those of the rutgers map v. <dig>

the genetic distances between adjacent markers and the 95% confidence intervals were estimated. the average intermarker spacing was  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  cm. the intermarker recombination rate was derived by dividing the intermarker genetic distance by the physical distance. the recombination rate patterns for chromosomes are illustrated in additional files . these figures are helpful in comparing the genome-wide recombination patterns of gendiscan and rutgers map v. <dig>  the sex-averaged recombination rate patterns of chromosome 8p were quite different . we compared  <dig> intermarker genetic distances between gendiscan and rutgers map v. <dig>  and calculated p-values for the significance of these differences . a histogram of these  <dig> normalized intermarker-interval-differences, or z scores transformed from the corresponding p-values, showed that the distribution of intermarker-interval-differences between the gendiscan map and rutgers map v. <dig> was close to normal .

although most of the intervals of the gendiscan map and rutgers map v. <dig> were in good agreement,  <dig> intervals  differed significantly after bonferroni's multiple comparison correction . two of these  <dig> intervals were excluded, since their intermarker genetic distances on rutgers map v. <dig> were derived by interpolation. thus, we identified  <dig> ethnically different marker intervals . the differences in local genomic structure difference in these intervals may cause local recombination rate differences among ethnic groups.

discussion
the human genome varies among ethnic groups as a result of their diverse history. complex phenotypes result from the interaction of different genes with the unique environments to which humans are exposed. finding specific disease loci within families helps identify the genetic causes of complex diseases effectively.

the gendiscan study, which began in  <dig>  was designed to identify specific genetic loci and genes that influence complex traits and diseases in northeast asian populations. as the lifestyle of northeast asians has become more westernized, the prevalence of complex diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and cancers, has increased. linkage analyses require appropriate genetic maps for identifying correct loci. hence we constructed a genetic map of an asian population as an initial step in our gendiscan study.

world populations can be grouped into nine clusters based on genetic distances: african; new guinean and australian; pacific islander; southeast asian; northeast asian; arctic northeast asian; amerind; north african and west asian; and european  <cit> . the northeast asian cluster includes japanese, north chinese, koreans and mongolians. since genetic distance within clusters is closer than between clusters, our genetic map of mongolians may be more applicable to japanese, north chinese and koreans than genetic maps of caucasians.

when we compared the gendiscan map with the caucasian rutgers map v. <dig>  we found that the genetic length of the gendiscan map was much shorter. genome-wide, mongolians show about  <dig>  fewer recombinations per meiosis compared with caucasians. this is due to a general trend of  <dig> marker intervals overall rather than several specific genomic regions. although the genome-wide recombination rate patterns showed good agreement between the two ethnic groups, those of asians were generally smaller. however, we also identified several regions in which the patterns did not correlate; that is some recombination jungles in the gendiscan map appear as recombination deserts in rutgers map v. <dig>  and vice versa.

a previous examination of ethnic differences in genetic maps identified no significant differences for genome-wide genetic length between caucasians and asians, but found a significant local difference on 8p, a finding identical to ours  <cit> . the ethnic difference on 8p is likely due to a frequent local polymorphic inversion  <cit> . interestingly, we found a suggestive inversion of marker orders against the physical map on 8p <dig>  by flips option of crimap. the sex averaged map of chromosome  <dig>  reflecting the inversion, is available on additional file  <dig>  since previous ethnic-specific maps were constructed using a small number of genetic markers  and nuclear families, with most families made up of no grandparents and several children, these findings may be less robust than ours  <cit> . generally, determining the phase of genotypes to find recombinations requires genetic information of three generations, or that of two generations with many children.

recombination is related to diversity of dna sequences, linkage disequilibrium  and copy number changes  <cit> . asian-americans have a smaller number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  than european-americans  and lower minor allele frequencies  of the snps  versus  <dig>  whose mafs > 5%)  <cit> . moreover, asians have a smaller number of haplotypes per block than caucasians   <cit>  and asian americans have fewer copy number variations  than european americans   <cit> . these findings indicate that asians have a more homogeneous genome than caucasians, probably as a result of their low recombination rate.

although genetic studies using snp markers or resequencing on random populations rather than families give fine-scale recombination pattern data, these data are indirect and may be biased by mutation, selection, drift and demography  <cit> . most recombinations occur in short kilobase scale regions, known as recombination hotspots  <cit> . fine-scale data have suggested that these hotspots and intensities may differ among different ethnic groups  <cit> . moreover, population-specific hotspots have also been identified, and populations of close geographic regions tend to show similar hotspot intensities  <cit> . the properties of recombination hotspots are not well known, but some characteristics have been described  <cit> . the local dna sequences of recombination hotspots present more long terminal repeats of retrotransposons, the1a and the1b, as well as ct-rich and ga-rich repeats  <cit> . some dna motifs, such as the cctccct oligomer of the1a and the1b, and the ccccacccc oligomer within recombination hotspots, may be local dna signals of recombination hotspots  <cit> . additional studies of recombination patterns, with comparisons among different ethnic groups, are necessary to understand the nature of recombination hotspots. the present study, which found significantly different marker intervals between two ethnic groups, can facilitate further comparisons of genomic variations among ethnic groups.

some comparative characteristics of the gendiscan map and rutgers map v. <dig> deserve attention. the number of markers used for genetic mapping was quite different . this may have caused the difference in genetic distances, since high, but not low, density markers can identify two very close individual recombination events. these double recombination events, however, were eliminated when constructing both maps, since they were thought likely to be non-mendelian genotyping errors, not two individual recombinations. compared with rutgers map v. <dig>  although the number of markers used in rutgers map v. <dig> was increased nearly twofold  <cit> , the marker-matched genome-wide genetic length of rutgers map v. <dig> is  <dig> cm shorter than that of rutgers map v. <dig> . moreover, construction of the gendiscan genetic map of chromosome  <dig> using fewer and fewer markers increases, rather than decreases, the genetic length . biologically, the double recombinations are considered very rare in human meiosis, since not only is recombination uncommon , but also one chiasma inhibits formation of another chiasma nearby . the kosambi map function, which is widely used and thought to reflect adequate levels of double recombination in humans, has been applied for calibrating the slight possibility of double recombination when constructing genetic maps  <cit> . therefore, if non-mendelian genotyping errors, which appear as double recombinations, were properly eliminated during the cleaning process, there is no reason to expect that small numbers of markers reduce genetic length in genetic maps.

the statistical methods used in the comparisons are also worthy of note. the paired t-test, which is used to compare of genetic lengths of the whole genome and chromosomes, is not the method of choice for testing the difference between sums of intervals , but is the method of choice for testing the difference between the average of intervals. however, since each interval distance of the gendiscan map is significantly shorter than that of rutgers map v. <dig>  the sum of interval distances of gendiscan is likely shorter. we therefore used paired t-tests to compare of whole genome genetic lengths and to estimate the significance levels of their differences.

we assumed that the number of recombination events between markers would follow a binomial distribution, then a normal distribution for estimating the 95% confidence interval of each intermarker genetic distance . adjusted wald methods were used for marker intervals, whose Î¸ equals zero. the 95% confidence intervals of the gendiscan interval distances and p-values for the significance of differences between gendiscan and rutgers map v. <dig> intervals must be interpreted with caution, since they were calculated under those assumptions. however, we believe that those values are helpful parameters for assessing the certainty and finding the significant differences between genetic maps.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we constructed a genetic map with large asian families. the gendiscan map may provide better results than caucasian genetic maps in linkage analysis of asians. we also found that the gendiscan map shows shorter genetic distances than a caucasian genetic map, with asians having  <dig>  fewer recombination events per meiosis than caucasians. the recombination rates of some marker intervals differed significantly between populations. our results illustrate the differences in recombination patterns between ethnic groups and provide clues to their underlying genomic variations.
