BACKGROUND

listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive, facultative intracellular bacterium that causes high mortality foodborne illnesses through contaminated food products  <cit> . l. monocytogenes exists in different environments due to its hardiness in harsh conditions, such as a wide ph range, high salt concentrations and ability to grow and persist at refrigeration temperatures  <cit> . these unique characteristics have made l. monocytogenes one of the major threats to the food industry and public health. several listeriosis outbreaks occurred in united states recently, linked to dairy products and fresh produce . ice cream-associated outbreaks are rarely reported. however, two epidemiologically unrelated outbreaks were linked to contaminated ice cream in recent years. a 2010– <dig> multistate listeriosis outbreak was linked to contaminated ice cream manufactured in the southern united states  <cit> . in late  <dig>  a different listeriosis outbreak in washington state, unrelated to the 2010– <dig> multistate outbreak, occurred in a hospital  in the pacific northwest of the united states, involving patients hospitalized for other medical conditions prior to exposure to milkshakes made from contaminated ice cream mixes manufactured in a company   <cit> . following the investigation of the washington state outbreak, intensive cleaning and sanitizing were conducted in the facility and hospital kitchen, although cleaning of the soft serve shake freezer took extra efforts, because milkshake was made inside the machine and disassembly was required for thorough cleaning  <cit> . in november  <dig>  another patient from hospital x, hospitalized for other conditions prior to exposure to l. monocytogenes, was linked to contaminated milkshakes by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis   <cit> . hospital x was using a different brand of ice cream mix from the  <dig> outbreak, which was tested negative for l. monocytogenes; but isolates recovered from the milkshake samples and swab samples from the milkshake machine matched the outbreak-associated isolates collected in  <dig>  <cit> , confirming that this third patient was also associated with this outbreak.

single nucleotide polymorphism -based and multilocus sequence typing  allele-based whole genome sequence  analyses have been utilized to support the findings of the listeriosis outbreak investigations and offer various advantages over pfge  <cit> . snp-based analyses could target snps in the whole genome  or the core genome . a whole genome mlst  scheme, targeting a specific pan-genome of  <dig> loci defined based on over  <dig> publicly available reference genomes of l. monocytogenes  <cit> , was implemented in pulsenet  <cit> . an alternative way to perform whole genome-based mlst is to target the entire coding loci that are specific to a set of closely-related isolates . this scheme may target loci unique to these isolates, which are not included in any pre-defined pan-genome locus set.

four l. monocytogenes species-specific core genome mlst  schemes have been developed . further, lineage-specific cgmlst schemes for  <dig> genetic lineages of l. monocytogenes were developed to improve the discriminatory power  <cit> . the objective of this study is to determine whether the results of whole genome snp analysis, whole genome-specific mlst /outbreak-specific cgmlst, lineage-specific and species-specific cgmlst analyses were consistent with pfge, and could support epidemiological evidence to delineate the hospital x - acquired outbreak.

RESULTS
isolates selected for wgs analysis are listed in table  <dig>  the outbreak-associated isolates had sequence type   <dig>  belonging to clonal complex   <dig>  a genetic lineage ii clonal group  <cit> . the non-outbreak isolate cfsan <dig>  had st <dig>  which belonged to cc <dig>  a serotype 1/2b or 3b clonal group  <cit> , and thus it is not illustrated in the phylogenetic trees. the outbreak isolates contained listeria pathogenicity island - <dig>  internalin a, b, c, e, f, h, j and p. they did not contain lipi- <dig> or lipi- <dig>  there were no premature stop codons  in inla.table  <dig> list of l. monocytogenes isolates analyzed in this study




the two clinical isolates collected in november and december  <dig> exhibited two pfge profiles, asci-p1/apai-p <dig> and asci-p2/apai-p <dig> . isolates from ice cream products manufactured by company a and environmental samples from company a facility areas, and isolates of unopened ice cream products and machine-dispensed products from hospital x, collected after the outbreak recognition in  <dig>  exhibited asci-p1/apai-p <dig>  asci-p2/apai-p <dig>  asci-p3/apai-p <dig> and asci-p4/apai-p <dig>  one environmental isolate was collected in march  <dig> from company a and one environmental isolate was collected in april  <dig> from company b who purchased dairy ingredients from company a; and they both exhibited asci-p1/apai-p <dig>  after the identification of the case-patient in november  <dig>  isolates were collected from the ice cream that remained in and were dispensed from the milkshake maker in hospital x and environmental samples from different areas  of the milkshake maker; and they exhibited asci-p1/apai-p <dig>  the same as the  <dig> clinical isolate. asci-p1/apai-p <dig>  asci-p2/apai-p <dig>  asci-p3/apai-p <dig> were rare pfge profiles in pulsenet; prior to this outbreak only one isolate in  <dig>  with no epidemiological link to this outbreak, exhibited asci-p2/apai-p <dig>  overall,  <dig> of  <dig> food and environmental isolates had indistinguishable pfge profiles from the  <dig> clinical isolates. two other environmental isolates had pfge profiles not observed in any clinical isolates.fig.  <dig> three asci-pfge banding patterns observed among outbreak-associated isolates




the whole genome snp analysis clustered all food, environmental and clinical isolates in  <dig> and  <dig>  except cfsan <dig> ; and separated them from the outgroup, cfsan <dig>  a cc <dig> strain not associated with the outbreak . isolates exhibiting the two clinical pfge profiles  and an isolate exhibiting asci-p3/apai-p <dig> were clustered together . this is consistent with the epidemiological finding that company a was the likely source of the outbreak in hospital x in november  <dig>  considering samples from unopened containers of ice cream mixes used to make ice cream/milkshakes in hospital x in november  <dig> were not from company a and were tested negative for l. monocytogenes, and that swab samples throughout the hospital kitchen surfaces were tested negative for l. monocytogenes  <cit> , l. monocytogenes isolates linked to the illnesses in  <dig> likely persisted in the ice cream/milkshake machine of hospital x through november  <dig> and contaminated products that were consumed by the case-patient identified in november  <dig>  company b, who purchased ingredients from company a, yielded an environmental isolate that was clustered together with company a isolates. thus, the whole-genome snp analysis was able to trace the spread of the outbreak strain over more than one facility. a second snp analysis containing only outbreak-associated isolates identified  <dig> polymorphic loci and revealed that the pairwise snp distances among all isolates were  <dig> to  <dig> . the food, environmental and clinical isolates collected in hospital x in november  <dig> formed a distinct clade . two snps specifically distinguished the november  <dig> isolates from other isolates, one synonymous snp  in an abc transporter atp-binding protein  and one non-synonymous snp  in 50s ribosomal protein l <dig> .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogeny of outbreak-associated isolates based on single nucleotide polymorphisms  identified by the center for food safety and applied nutrition  snp pipeline using cfsan <dig> for comparison. the tree is rooted at midpoint. isolate id is followed by sample type and collection year and abbreviation of month. the isolates that persisted in the milkshake maker until november  <dig> and the clinical isolate collected in november  <dig> are in blue color. the isolates collected in march and april  <dig> were from ice cream processing facilities, not the hospital milkshake maker




a species-specific cgmlst scheme targeting  <dig> genes  generated a phylogeny congruent with the snp-based wgs phylogeny. outbreak-associated food, environmental and clinical isolates in  <dig> and  <dig> were clustered together and separated from the outgroup . outbreak isolates differed by  <dig> to  <dig>  alleles. among them, isolates collected in  <dig> differed by up to  <dig> alleles; the two  <dig> clinical isolates differed by  <dig> alleles and they differed from the  <dig> clinical isolate by  <dig> and  <dig> alleles. the isolates that persisted in the hospital milkshake machine until november  <dig> and the clinical isolate collected in november  <dig> also formed a distinct clade inside the outbreak cluster. two alleles specifically distinguished the november  <dig> isolates from other isolates, lmo <dig>  and lmo <dig> . another species-specific cgmlst scheme targeting  <dig> genes  also clustered together outbreak-associated isolates collected in  <dig> and  <dig> . with this scheme, outbreak isolates differed by  <dig> to  <dig>  alleles. among them, isolates collected in  <dig> differed by up to  <dig> alleles; the two  <dig> clinical isolates differed by  <dig> alleles and they differed from the  <dig> clinical isolate by  <dig> and  <dig> alleles. however, the outbreak-associated isolates collected in november  <dig> did not form a distinct clade inside the outbreak cluster, because lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> were not in the gene set targeted by 1748-cgmlst. the minimum spanning tree  based on 1827-cgmlst also revealed that the november  <dig> isolates formed its own clade. this tree does not show a clear central allele profile because the majority of the isolates have their unique allele profiles.fig.  <dig> neighbor-joining phylogeny of outbreak-associated isolates based on two cgmlst schemes, a 1827-cgmlst and b 1748-cgmlst, using cfsan <dig> for comparison. the trees are rooted at midpoint. the isolates that persisted in the milkshake maker until november  <dig> and the clinical isolate collected in november  <dig> are in blue color. the isolates collected in march and april  <dig> were from ice cream processing facilities, not the hospital milkshake maker. the minimum, maximum and median of pairwise allele differences of outbreak isolates are indicated near the root

due to the difference in clustering outbreak-associated isolates collected in november  <dig> by the two species-specific cgmlst schemes, we further developed a whole genome-specific mlst scheme  using the annotated genome . this scheme targeted  <dig> loci in the entire genome of outbreak-associated isolates, which could be alternatively named as outbreak-specific cgmlst because those loci were core to the outbreak isolates. we also performed a previously developed lineage-ii specific cgmlst scheme targeting  <dig> loci  <cit> . the results of these two schemes corroborated those of the 1827-cgmlst and whole genome snp analyses: food, environmental and clinical isolates collected in november  <dig> formed a distinct clade inside the outbreak cluster . both schemes indeed contained the genes encoding the 50s ribosomal protein l <dig> and the abc transporter atp-binding protein.

two putative complete prophages in the reference genome cfsan <dig> were predicted by phast/phaster  <cit> : prophage  <dig>  and prophage  <dig> . blast analysis showed that all outbreak isolates contained a conserved prophage  <dig> . blast analysis further showed that all outbreak isolates exhibiting asci-p <dig> and asci-p <dig> contained a conserved prophage  <dig> . the outbreak isolates exhibiting asci-p <dig>  did not contain prophage  <dig> . the non-outbreak isolate  from company a environment aligned with prophage  <dig> and prophage  <dig> for 18% and 71% blast coverage, respectively, indicating significant prophage divergence from outbreak isolates. the outgroup cfsan <dig> aligned with prophage  <dig> and prophage  <dig> for 87% and 14% blast coverage, respectively. the reference genome is a draft genome, and thus multiple fragments that belonged to other putative prophages were also predicted by the software but either they were incomplete prophages or we could not assemble the complete prophages from this draft genome . prophage  <dig> contained an asci restriction site , thus the loss of prophage  <dig> contributed to the asci-pfge pattern change from asci-p <dig> or asci-p <dig>  to asci-p <dig> . loss of an asci restriction site would lead to the combination of two restriction fragments  and loss of the prophage  <dig> would result in a  <dig> kbp deletion. thus the combined fragment should be around  <dig> kbp, which was slightly different from the ~ <dig> kbp fragment . thus other dna variations  could co-cause this pfge banding pattern change. we were not able to identify this variation using the draft genome.

discussion
a 7-gene mlst scheme has been used to define major clonal groups of l. monocytogenes, designated as cc or singleton  <cit>  and it was recently demonstrated that the this definition was generally compatible with wgs clustering  <cit> . isolates associated with this outbreak had st <dig>  belonging to cc <dig> which was commonly isolated in the mid-1950s and its prevalence had since decreased  <cit> . however, it likely has re-emerged recently, evidenced by its isolation in  <dig> clinical cases in lombardy, italy between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , as well as its association with a 2012 u.s. outbreak linked to ricotta salata cheese products manufactured in italy  <cit> . thus, cc <dig> has been involved in at least two outbreaks to date and represents an epidemic clone. inla encodes internalin a, which is involved in the invasion of human intestinal epithelia cells and could play an important role in listeria virulence  <cit> . premature stop codons  in inla lead to truncated protein in some listeria strains and were linked to attenuated virulence of those strains in mammalian hosts and thus it has been  <cit> . moreover, pmscs are mostly found in lineage ii strains and isolated more frequently from food and food production environment than from human listeriosis cases  <cit> . our finding is consistent with previous observation that outbreak-associated strains generally do not contain pmscs  <cit> . to date,  <dig> listeria pathogenicity islands  have been characterized as virulence factors: lipi- <dig> is conserved across the entire species of l. monocytogenes  <cit> ; lipi- <dig> is specific to l. ivanovii  <cit> ; lipi- <dig> is mostly present in lineage i isolates  <cit> ; and the very recently identified lipi- <dig> is present in several lineage i ccs and a few lineage ii, iii and iv strains  <cit> . this explains why we observed only lipi- <dig> in isolates associated with this outbreak. in comparison, the 2010– <dig> multistate ice cream outbreak strains  contained lipi- <dig>  but not lipi- <dig> or lipi- <dig>  <cit>  and the recent isolates  from the stone fruit, caramel apple and leafy green salad outbreaks contained all lipi- <dig>  lipi- <dig> and lipi- <dig>  <cit> .

in this study, wgs could not only trace the transmission of the outbreak strain between two facilities, but also reveal its persistence in the soft serve ice cream/milkshake machine for one year. furthermore, wgs was able to cluster all outbreak-associated isolates, despite their difference in asci-pfge profiles. the milkshake maker had a regular sanitation schedule, and extra sanitizing effort after the outbreak, including disassembly of the machine at least twice, was taken after the outbreak recognition  <cit> . thus, it is probable that while the majority of the l. monocytogenes cells contaminating the milkshake maker in  <dig> were eliminated during sampling and sanitizing; a few cells escaped and/or survived, contaminated other areas of the milkshake maker later, and eventually made their presence in the final product during operation. this also concurred with our results that the food, environmental and clinical isolates collected in november  <dig> formed its own wgs clade and thus had a recent common ancestor.

the high resolution of wgs has been demonstrated in various studies by differentiating outbreak isolates from non-outbreak isolates, especially those matched by pfge  <cit> . in addition, wgs can achieve more than just discrimination between unrelated isolates. for example, it can be used to study the microevolution of different isolates in the same outbreak setting, identify genotypes that may be specific to different product varieties or production lines in the same facility  <cit> , and ultimately shed some light on root cause analysis. for another example, combination of core genome and accessory genome was needed to elucidate the epidemiology of isolates persistent in a food processing facility for 12 years  <cit> . comparison between outbreak and non-outbreak isolates could provide potential candidates for future functional genomics analyses on virulence. comparison among strains persistent in an environment could identify potential candidates for studying the evolution and mechanisms of l. monocytogenes persistence. wgs analyses targeting the entire genome could certainly reveal more potential genetic markers. for example, in this study, whole genome-based analyses, lineage-specific cgmlst and 1827-cgmlst identified unique variants in the genes encoding abc transporter atp-binding protein  and 50s ribosomal protein l <dig>  of the persistent cells, which contributed to the formation of the distinct clade containing these persistent cells in the phylogenetic trees; while 1748-cgmlst did not yield that clustering because of the absence of these two genes in its gene set. the 1827-cgmlst scheme and the 1748-cgmlst scheme share  <dig> common loci , thus, despite their sufficient discriminatory power to distinguish epidemiologically unrelated isolates, differences in results are expected when they are applied to study the microevolution within the scope of an outbreak. we also evaluated another cgmlst scheme targeting  <dig> core genes of l. monocytogenes  <cit>  which contained lmo <dig> and lmo <dig>  and it generated a phylogeny congruent with that by 1827-cgmlst and snp analyses: the november  <dig> isolates formed a distinct clade within the outbreak cluster . it is possible that different isolates collected in november  <dig> simultaneously accumulated snps in both genes during evolution from their  <dig> ancestor; however, it is also possible that their  <dig> ancestor already had these two unique snps, which remained unchanged during persistence in the milkshake maker until november  <dig>  the expression of 50s ribosomal protein l <dig> in l. monocytogenes is affected by alkali-tolerance response, which may be critical for this pathogen to survive in human gastrointestinal tract and during food processing  <cit> . mutation in this gene has been linked to antimicrobial resistance in other bacteria  <cit> . the abc transporter atp-binding protein encoded by lmo <dig> is upregulated when l. monocytogenes was exposed to bacteriocin pediocin  <cit>  or during growth within murine macrophages  <cit> . the exact roles of these two proteins in the survival and evolution of l. monocytogenes in food processing environment remain to be investigated.

generally, a cgmlst scheme targets the entire population of l. monocytogenes  and the core loci comprise ~60% of a typical coding genome. the species-specific schemes are suitable for evolutionary analysis and nomenclature. a standardized nomenclature system based on cgmlst could be beneficial in surveillance studies because isolates from different environment, food commodities and geographical locations analyzed in different studies can be easily compared to suggest possible links. however, vigorous collaborative validation needs to be performed on multiple elements in this nomenclature system: the centralized database, the set of cgmlst targets, the platform to run the analysis, the parameter and algorithm to call allele differences, the mechanism to deal with missing regions due to draft sequencing, and the threshold to define cgmlst or cluster types. minimum spanning tree based on a 7-gene mlst has been used to define clonal complexes  <cit> , in which the majority of the strains share the same sequence type, and that sequence type serves as the central allele profile to define single locus variants. this approach might not be suitable for cgmlst since isolates could easily differ by one allele in cgmlst and thus no clear central allele profile can be easily identified, as illustrated in this outbreak . an approach to define cgmlst cluster type is to set an allele threshold among isolates, but different studies have proposed different thresholds  <cit> . in addition, such approach is not perfect because the entry order of submission of a set of isolates could potentially affect the assignment of cgmlst cluster types of those isolates  <cit> . nonetheless, species-specific cgmlst schemes are generally satisfactory in differentiating epidemiologically unrelated isolates  <cit> . however, when wgs is used to differentiate among a set of closely related isolates and/or to study the microevolution of isolates within the scope of one outbreak, a flexible definition of cgmlst could be explored to fully utilize the high resolution of wgs  <cit> . cgmlst schemes specific to individual lineages of l. monocytogenes contain loci comprising ~80% of a typical coding genome  <cit> . in this study, we developed a wgsmlst, which was essentially an outbreak-specific cgmlst, to analyze the microevolution among outbreak isolates. in contrast to wgmlst which contains a pre-defined set of pan-genome loci  <cit> , this wgsmlst targets the entire set of coding loci of an outbreak isolate, and thus could target any novel loci that are not in the pan-genome pre-defined based on a set of previously published genomes. this is similar to the whole genome snp-based approach that maximizes the resolution by selecting one outbreak isolate as the reference to analyze other outbreak isolates  <cit> .

several previous studies using snp-based wgs analysis employed a complete genome closed by pacbio® technology as the reference  <cit> . however, using pacbio® may not be practical in every outbreak investigations. here, we explored the use of a clc genomics workbench-assembled draft genome  as the reference for the cfsan snp pipeline and produced a wgs phylogeny that supported pfge and epidemiological evidence. we also tried cfsan <dig> assembled by spades assembler  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , and the wgs analysis generated the same phylogeny with minor changes of the lengths of several tree branches . clc and spades both map raw reads to initial assembly for error correction; however, error in the final assembly could still occur. we mapped raw reads of cfsan <dig> to both clc assembly and spades assembly using the cfsan snp pipeline and found that raw reads were consistent with clc assembly but differed from the spades assembly by  <dig> snps. as a result, between the final snp matrices generated using clc and spades assemblies the pairwise snp differences of several isolate pairs differed by 1– <dig> snps. thus, we believe the clc assembly was more accurate than the spades assembly in this case, although we found that spades can be more accurate in other cases . nonetheless, using either assembly as the reference yielded the same wgs clustering. the wgsmlst was defined using the annotated, clc-assembled draft genome of cfsan <dig>  a completely closed cfsan <dig> genome could probably have revealed additional coding regions as wgsmlst loci and thus further improved the resolution of wgsmlst, although this improved resolution may not be critical for the purpose of outbreak investigation.


asci-pfge banding pattern changes due to prophage variations have been observed among isolates associated with a few outbreaks. in this outbreak, a prophage loss led to the loss of an asci restriction site in the prophage, resulting in combination of two asci fragments, although other unidentified dna variations could co-affect the pfge banding pattern change from asci-p1/asci-p <dig> to asci-p <dig>  dna variations underlying the difference between asci-p <dig> and asci-p <dig> were not identified. among isolates of several other outbreaks, gain/loss of prophage in a pfge fragment caused the fragment to shift to a different position in the gel  <cit> . in one outbreak, gain/loss of  <dig> prophages occurred among different isolates, and asci restriction analysis of the completely closed genome allowed the precise determination of the genome positions of all asci fragments, which unambiguously identified the gain/loss of the specific prophage in the specific asci fragment  <cit> . previous analyses have shown that reference-based reads mapping and snp calling in repetitive regions and insertion regions of prophages could yield inconclusive snps, which were usually present in high density   <cit> . recombination events could also generate high - density snps  <cit> . thus, when analyzing a group of closely related isolates  associated with the same outbreak, cfsan snp pipeline offers the option to apply a filter to remove these high-density snps from the final snp matrices. in this study, the  <dig> removed high - density variant regions contained snps only between pnusal001241/cfsan <dig> and other isolates, and these high - density variant regions were all in insertion sites of putative prophages: the prophage  <dig> described above, and  <dig> fragments from other incomplete prophage .

the patients in hospital x involved in the washington state outbreak under discussion in this study and patients in a hospital  involved in the 2010– <dig> multistate outbreak  <cit>  consumed milkshakes prepared from contaminated ice cream products, and this highlights the potential of ice cream as a vehicle for listeriosis infection, given that l. monocytogenes could grow in milkshakes, especially when the milkshakes go through temperature abuse during serving. however, l. monocytogenes in milkshakes prepared from the multistate outbreak-associated ice cream had a relatively long log phase  and a slow growth rate of  <dig>  cfu/log/h at room temperature, which could be attributed to low level of initial amount of naturally occurring l. monocytogenes  <cit>  and/or the variety and levels of competing microflora present in the ice cream samples  <cit> . the ice cream products associated with the washington state outbreak were not available for such analysis. the milkshake maker used in hospital y involved in the multistate outbreak was a drink mixer employing simple propellers and were relatively easy to clean  <cit> , and the environmental testing in the hospital kitchen, including the drink mixer, did not yield l. monocytogenes  <cit> . the milkshake maker used in hospital x was a soft serve shake freezer which held ice cream mix and made milkshake inside the machine to serve through the dispensing nozzle, and had reusable parts of reservoirs, pipes and mixers that made contact with ice cream  <cit> ; thus it was more difficult to clean, which could explain why l. monocytogenes was able to survive the sampling and cleaning. the occurrence of these two outbreaks, involving patients with weakened immune systems, could contribute to our understanding of the risk associated with l. monocytogenes contamination in ice cream.

CONCLUSIONS
wgs analyses clustered epidemiologically related isolates, and clarified the microevolution and persistence of isolates within the scope of one outbreak. a flexible definition of core genome mlst, targeting a species, a genetic lineage or an outbreak, could be explored to offer different levels of resolution based on the set of strains investigated and the purpose of the analysis.
