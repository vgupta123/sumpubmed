BACKGROUND
eukaryotic cells have developed efficient ways to modulate the properties of proteins, in order to rapidly respond to variations of external conditions and to face potentially dangerous external events. among them is the reversible, covalent attachment of modifying groups. post-translational modifications include small entities such as phosphate or acetyl group, but also entire protein, such as the member of ubiquitin  family. ub is a  <dig> aminoacids polypeptide that has been found appended to many proteins. a cascade of enzymes is required for the ubiquitination reaction. the e <dig> activating enzyme transfers ub to an e <dig> conjugating enzyme that, in cooperation with an e <dig> ub ligase, forms a covalent isopeptide bond between the carboxy-terminus of ub and a lysine residue of the target protein. e <dig> enzymes are often characterized by the presence of a c3hc <dig>  finger motif, which binds zinc and is required for ub ligase activity  <cit> . ub contains seven lysine residues that can themselves be substrate of ubiquitination, giving rise to polyub chains that are differentially decoded by the cell. monoub and polyub conjugates are recognized by proteins through means of short domains called ubds   <cit> . the canonical view of ubiquitination as a device to mark proteins for degradation has been evolved to a more multifaceted set of functions, including dna repair, transcription, cell cycle control, signalling, stress response, viral budding, endocytosis and membrane traffic  <cit> .

since it is one of the most abundant post-translational modifications occurring on histones, ubiquitination functions in the reorganization of chromatin, increasing its accessibility to a number of regulatory factors. although the role of such modification has been elusive for long, now it is appearing clear that histone ubiquitination serves to regulate gene transcription, either inhibiting or activating it  <cit> . in addition, it has been recently described a critical role for ubiquitination of histones h2a and h2ax in the response to dna damage. works from different groups pointed out the relevance of this modification in the correct activation of the signalling cascade triggered by the formation of dna double strand breaks   <cit> . activation of atm induced by dsbs elicits a cascade of phosphorylation and ubiquitination events that promotes the formation of supramolecular complexes, namely the dna damage response  foci  <cit> . ddr foci function in integrating and amplifying the signal, which results in cell-cycle arrest allowing the cell either to repair the damage or to die.

we recently identified and characterized two ubds present in rabex- <dig>  a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for rab <dig>  named ruz  and miu   <cit> . in particular, miu is the prototype of a new family of ubds, since it shows similarity with the well-characterized uim motif, but it displays a peculiar inverted orientation in the structure  <cit> . here, we characterized the miu-containing protein rnf <dig> as a new e <dig> ub-ligase that induces the formation of k63-linked polyub chains by means of its n-terminal ring finger domain. we demonstrated that histones h2a and h2ax, but not h2b, are substrates of its ub ligase activity. we found that rnf <dig> is recruited to ddr foci upon formation of dsbs where it co-localizes with the ddr markers γh2ax and 53bp <dig>  and it promotes sustained ubiquitination at the ddr foci. finally, we suggest a double mode of recruitment of rnf <dig> to ddr foci, depending only in part on the functionality of the two miu domains.

RESULTS
rnf <dig> is a new ub binding protein that localizes in nuclear structures by means of the miu domains
we recently identified and characterized a novel family of ubds, named miu  <cit> , which defined a new family of proteins, the miu-containing proteins. among them is rnf <dig> , a  <dig> amino acid-long protein containing a ring finger motif , two miu domains and three putative nuclear localization signals . we previously demonstrated that the isolated miu domains of rnf <dig> were sufficient to interact with ub  <cit> . to address the ub binding ability of the full-length protein, we performed pull-down assays using the gst-rnf <dig> fusion protein. we found that rnf <dig> interacts with ubiquitinated proteins derived from cell extracts , indicating that it is a bona fide ub-binding protein. inactivation of the two miu domains, obtained by ala to gly substitution at position  <dig> and  <dig> of the protein , markedly reduced the binding of rnf <dig> to ubiquitinated proteins. on the contrary, the rf-defective mutant, carrying a double cys to ser substitution  that disrupts the ring finger structure, did not alter ub binding capability. then, we performed an ub-binding assay using synthetic k48-polyub chains that recapitulated the binding specificity obtained with the cell extracts . in fact, we observed that rnf <dig> binding to ub chains depends on the integrity of the mius, while the rf* did not affect the interaction. we can conclude that the miu domains are required for the binding of rnf <dig> to ubiquitinated proteins.

to gain insight into the function of the protein, we studied the subcellular localization of rnf <dig> by immunofluorescence analysis. as expected by the presence of three nls within its sequence, rnf <dig> shows nuclear localization , with a heterogeneous pattern that in most cases appears as marked punctuate staining. aiming at the identification of the domains responsible for the formation of the rnf <dig> positive foci, we tested the localization of the mutated forms of the protein defective in the rf and in the miu domains, carrying either single  or double  substitutions. as shown in figure 1c, we found that the integrity of the miu domains is required for the proper recruitment of rnf <dig> to the nuclear foci, with a major role played by miu <dig>  on the other hand, the inactivation of the rf did not exert any effect on the formation of the rnf <dig> foci, although they appeared smaller then the wild type.

rnf <dig> is a ub ligase with specificity for the formation of k63-linked polyub chains
the rf domain is frequently associated with e <dig> ub ligase activity, working in concert with the e <dig> ub-conjugating enzyme to ubiquitinate specific substrates  <cit> . within the e2-e <dig> complex, the e <dig> enzyme is endowed with the catalytic activity, while the e <dig> ligase confers substrate specificity. to investigate the potential intrinsic e <dig> ligase activity of rnf <dig>  we performed a cell-free in vitro ubiquitination assay using either the wild type protein or the rf-defective mutant. we found that rnf <dig> sustained auto-ubiquitination, and that its e <dig> ligase activity was dependent on the integrity of the rf domain .

then, we asked if rnf <dig> was able to promote ubiquitination also in vivo. we ectopically expressed rnf <dig> and the rf* mutant in hela cells and proceeded with immunofluorescence staining using anti-ub antibody  that recognized ub only when conjugated in chains. strikingly, almost all cells expressing recombinant rnf <dig> dramatically increased the amount of ubiquitinated proteins in the nucleus , which interestingly co-stained with rnf <dig>  as predicted by in vitro studies, the rf-defective form of rnf <dig> did not increase the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins. altogether, these results strongly proved that rnf <dig> is an e <dig> ub ligase, whose activity depends on the integrity of the rf domain.

polyubiquitination on k <dig> is a well-known hallmark for proteasomal degradation, while other types of ub linkage serve to finely regulate numerous cellular processes, including endocytosis and trafficking, transcription, cell cycle control, dna damage response and repair  <cit> . thus, to further characterize the type of ubiquitination promoted by rnf <dig>  we took advantage of two ub-chain specific antibodies recently described  <cit> , namely apu <dig>  and apu <dig> a <dig>  which specifically recognize the k48- or k63-linked ub chains, respectively. immunofluorescence analysis revealed that in the presence of rnf <dig>  the polyubiquitinated proteins were recognized mainly by the k63-linkage specific antibodies, and in minor portion by the k48-linkage specific antibodies . this result indicates that rnf <dig> promotes the formation of k63-linked polyub chains, suggesting its potential involvement in the regulation of nuclear events rather then a function in proteasomal degradation.

rnf <dig> is a chromatin-binding protein that physically interacts with histone core
to better characterize the rnf168-positive nuclear structures, we treated cells ectopically expressing either gfp-rnf <dig> or the vector alone with detergent prior to fixation. interestingly, we found that gfp-rnf <dig> resides in triton x-100-insoluble nuclear structures , suggesting that it is bound to chromatin. notably, the rf-defective mutant retained its nuclear localization upon detergent extraction, while the mutant miu1-2* is largely released by the treatment, suggesting that chromatin association of rnf <dig> is mostly dependent on the integrity of the miu domains. comparable results were obtained with the flag-tagged version of the protein .

this finding prompted us to verify if rnf <dig> is able to interact with histones. to this purpose, we performed a gst pull-down assay incubating gst or gst-rnf <dig> with cellular extracts derived from 293t cells expressing a gfp-tagged version of histones h2a, h2b, h <dig> or h <dig> . interestingly, in all cases we found association with rnf <dig>  suggesting that the interaction likely occurs with the histone core. we can conclude that rnf <dig> is a chromatin-associated protein that is recruited through the binding with the nucleosome.

histones are substrates of rnf <dig> ligase activity both in vitro and in vivo
histone h2a and h2b ubiquitination is emerging as instrumental to finely regulate important nuclear processes  <cit> . since we have shown that rnf <dig> is an ub ligase that interacts with histones, we asked whether it is also able to induce their ubiquitination. thus, we performed the in vitro ubiquitination assay using purified histones h2a and h2b as substrates. to evaluate the ubiquitination status of them we used antibodies that specifically recognize the ubiquitinated form of histones h2a  and h2b . we found that rnf <dig> was able to induce ubiquitination of histone h2a in a rf-dependent manner, while it failed to modify histone h2b .

next, we aimed at verifying if rnf <dig> ligase activity targets histones also in vivo. to test this, we followed two different experimental approaches. first, we performed biochemical analysis on cells ectopically expressing the wild type rnf <dig> or the rf defective mutant, together with histones h2a or h2b . we found that expression of the wild type but not of the rf* mutant markedly increased the level of ubiquitination of h2a . ubiquitination of h2b was not affected . second, we analysed the effect of rnf <dig> expression on h2a ubiquitination by immunofluorescence analysis . as a matter of fact, we found that ubiquitination of histones h2a was highly increased in cells where the wild type rnf <dig> is expressed, while it was not in cells expressing the catalytically inactive rf* mutant . furthermore, we aimed at verifying if the rnf168-mediated ubiquitination of histone h2a occurred through k63-linkage, as suggested by immunofluorescence staining . acid extracts derived from cells ectopically-expressing gfp and gfp-rnf <dig>  together with flag-h2a, showed that rnf <dig> promoted the formation of polyubiquitinated proteins assembled through k <dig> . altogether, our data clearly indicate that rnf <dig> ubiquitinates histone h2a both in vitro and in vivo, likely inducing k63-linked ubiquitination.

rnf <dig> is recruited to dna damage response foci upon dna damage
the importance of ub-mediated network in the ddr and dna repair is continuously increasing. ubiquitination of histones h2a and h2ax is crucial to recruit important ddr mediators like 53bp <dig> and brca <dig> and to promote the signalling cascade elicited by dsbs. since we have shown that rnf <dig> is able to ubiquitinate histones, we asked whether rnf <dig> is also involved in the ddr. first, we tested the ability of rnf <dig> to induce ubiquitination of h2ax, in addition to h2a. our biochemical analysis on histones revealed that expression of rnf <dig> induced ubiquitination of h2ax in a rf-dependent manner , indicating that rnf <dig> is an ub ligase for the histone h2a family. this promising finding highlighted a possible role for rnf <dig> in the complex series of events that regulate the cellular response to dna damage. upon dna lesions, ddr proteins are rapidly recruited to the damaged site, in order to transduce and amplify the downstream response. thus, we tested if also rnf <dig> is recruited to the ddr foci after exposure to genotoxic agents. we found that upon treatment with etoposide, which induces dsbs by inhibition of the topoisomerase ii, rnf <dig> largely co-localized with markers of the ddr , as demonstrated by the co-staining with antibodies directed against 53bp <dig>  γh2ax , and phospho-s/tq . noteworthy, recruitment of rnf <dig> to ddr foci upon induction of dsbs is dose-dependent, as demonstrated by treatment of hela cells, transfected with flag-rnf <dig>  with increasing amount of etoposide . furthermore, we examined the recruitment of rnf <dig> to ddr foci upon treatment with other genotoxic agents, like hydrohyurea and uv light and we found co-localization with γh2ax in all cases . then, we investigated the ability of the rnf <dig> mutants to be recruited to ddr foci, and we found that the rf integrity is not required, since its inactivation did not affect significantly its re-localization . on the contrary, the miu-defective mutant displayed a diffused staining, although a small population is concentrated to ddr foci. to better elucidate this point, we thought to extract soluble proteins by detergent treatment  before fixation and proceed with immunofluorescence analysis . strikingly, triton x- <dig> treatment removed the majority of the miu1-2* from the nucleoplasm, uncovering the portion of the protein that retained the ability to localize to ddr foci. this finding suggests that it might exist an additional mode of rnf <dig> recruitment to ddr, which is miu-independent.

in figure 2c we have shown that rnf <dig> expression dramatically increased the amount of ubiquitinated proteins in the rnf <dig> positive foci. thus, we asked whether we could detect a similar burst of ubiquitination also at the site of dna damage. as predicted, we found that, upon treatment with etoposide, the ubiquitination signal was highly increased at rnf <dig> positive foci, but not in the presence of the rf* mutant .

it has been demonstrated that the ddr can be initiated even in the absence of dna damage by the sole recruitment of the ddr protein  <cit> . since we observed that ectopical expression of rnf <dig> dramatically increased the amount of ubiquitinated proteins in the nucleus, we thought that this event might alone activate the ddr, without genotoxic agents. however, we could not detect any activation of the ddr by simply expressing rnf <dig> . nevertheless, we observed a prolonged ubiquitination in cells that expressed rnf <dig>  compared to control cells, and to the cell expressing the rf* mutant.

overall our data strongly indicate that rnf <dig> is a new histone ub ligase recruited at the ddr foci upon formation of dsbs, where it considerably increased the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins.

discussion
ubiquitination is a versatile intracellular signalling system largely diffused and with a broad spectrum of possible effects. originally considered as a universal mark to target proteins for degradation, now its importance is well recognized in a plethora of cellular processes. in fact, ubiquitination is able to regulate ordinary nuclear events, like transcriptional regulation, or to counteract exceptional harmful situations, such as the formation of dna dsbs induced by genotoxic agents. in both cases, a protagonist role is played by histones, since it has been demonstrated that ubiquitination of histones significantly impacts the regulation of gene silencing and the maintenance of genome stability.

here, we identified and characterized a new ring finger protein, rnf <dig>  which is endowed with ub ligase activity, inducing the formation of k63-polyub chains. rnf <dig> localizes in chromatin-associated structures, and it promotes ubiquitination of histones belonging to the h2a family. upon dna damage induced by chemical or physical agents, rnf <dig> is recruited to ddr foci, where it significantly increases local concentration of ubiquitinated proteins. in this way, rnf <dig> might be able to alter the highly ordered structure of chromatin, thereby permitting the access of regulatory factors and creating the docking site for ubd-containing proteins.

the ubiquitination status of histones is known to influence gene transcription, but the exact consequence of that is still not well understood. it has been recently demonstrated that in xenopus laevis ubiquitination/deubiquitination of histone h2a regulates the cell-cycle m-phase progression and activation of the hox gene expression, thereby driving embryonic development  <cit> . we found that rnf <dig> ubiquitinates histone h2a but not h2b, assessing its specificity for the h2a family. we wonder whether rnf <dig>  by acting as a modifier of chromatin structure, is responsible for the activation or the inhibition of specific genes, and, if this is the case, which is the consequence of such regulation.

another aspect raised from this study is the issue of localization. activation of ddr pathways does not require broken dna, but can be elicited by stable association of single repair factors with chromatin. this has been demonstrated for some ddr proteins, like mdc <dig>  nbs <dig>  mre <dig> and atm, which work as sensor or transducer of damage, but not for downstream effectors like chk <dig> and chk <dig>  <cit> . we reasoned that expression of rnf <dig>  by increasing the ubiquitination of h2a and h2ax on chromatin, might be sufficient to initiate the ddr cascade in the absence of damage. unlikely, we did not observe any significant activation. whether this includes the action of other types of post-translational modifications or the recruitment of additional factors is still not known.

during the preparation of this manuscript, two different groups reported the role of rnf <dig> at the dsbs induced by ionizing radiations  <cit> . they showed that it functions as ub ligase downstream the ub ligase rnf <dig>  by amplifying the ubiquitination signal leading to accumulation of 53bp <dig> and brca <dig> at the site of damage. they demonstrated that recruitment of rnf <dig> to ddr foci is mediated by the binding of the two miu domains to uh2a. although we obtained very similar results, there are some important differences. we found that in the absence of genotoxic treatment, ectopical expression of rnf <dig> can increase the amount of ubiquitinated proteins and in particular of histone h2a and h2ax. this effect is unlikely due to the over-expression of the protein since it has been observed in cells expressing different amount of recombinant proteins, and because it is strictly dependent on the integrity of the rf domain. moreover, we recognized a major role played by the two mius  in the proper recruitment of rnf <dig> to the ddr foci upon dna damage, as observed by stewart et al. and doil et al.  <cit> . conversely, we found that a small but significant population of the miu-defective mutant still localizes to ddr foci. this result might suggest an additional mode of recruitment to dna lesions, which is miu-independent. it will be relevant to identify the molecular partner of rnf <dig> that cooperates in its re-localization to dna damage structures and might be crucial for the full activation of the ddr program.

noteworthy, durocher and colleagues identified two mutations in rnf <dig> gene as responsible of the riddle  syndrome, a recently described immunodeficiency disorder  <cit> . the mutations identified by the authors give rise to two different truncated proteins, which impede 53bp <dig> accumulation at ddr foci and hence the proper activation of ddr. both mutants retain the rf domain, responsible for the ub ligase activity, but lack the miu <dig>  indicating that both the ub binding and the ligase activity are required for the full rnf <dig> activity. our finding that the miu-defective mutant is still partly recruited to the ddr sites suggests that the impairment of the miu domains might generate a partially functional protein.

overall, these findings testified the enormous relevance of proteins that change chromatin structure on the onset of human diseases and tumorigenesis. a systematic search for molecular alterations addressing this important class of proteins will help to elucidate the pathogenesis of the human syndromes that are still orphans.

the dsbs are the most harmful lesions that occur on the genome, and are induced by external stimuli, like physical and chemical agents, or can form spontaneously, during normal dna replication and vj recombination in immune cells. to repair the damage, cells activate several pathways, depending on the cell-cycle phase, which interact each other and cooperate. the homologous recombination  process uses homologous dna sequences to repair lesions, and generally works in phase g <dig>  while during phase g1/s the cell exploits the nhej to ligate broken dsb ends.

although the riddle syndrome is characterized by a severe immunodeficiency, suggesting an altered development of the immune system, it did not display any vj recombination defects  <cit> . nevertheless, it is important to remark that the two truncated versions of rnf <dig> present in the riddle patient might retain a residual activity that allow the execution of certain cellular processes. hence, we speculate that rnf <dig> might have a double role to counteract the formation of the dsbs and to guarantee genome surveillance, both in the process of hr and in nhej.

CONCLUSIONS
we can envision a scenario in which rnf <dig> might regulate chromatin structure, through ubiquitination of histone h2a, and perhaps of other still unknown factors. in addition, upon formation of dsbs, it is rapidly re-localized to the site of lesion, where it participates in the activation of the checkpoint signalling pathways, through activation of either the non-homologous end joining or the homologous recombinantion.
