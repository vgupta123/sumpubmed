BACKGROUND
sweet orange , one of the most important fruit crops worldwide, is responsible for 75% of citrus production used both as fresh fruit and processed juice  <cit> . orange fruit is believed to contain many phytochemicals which are beneficial to human health  <cit> . carotenoids are a group of the health-promoting products which may serve as antioxidants, vitamin a precursors, and cancer-preventing effectors  <cit> . orange fruit is reported with more than  <dig> species of carotenoids  <cit> , but lycopene are absent from common varieties  <cit> . interest in lycopene metabolism and regulation is growing rapidly because a variety of epidemiological trials have suggested that higher intake of lycopene-containing fruits or foods are associated with decreased cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer risks  <cit> . so far, three sweet orange mutants with lycopene accumulation in the fruits were reported: shara  <cit> , cara cara  <cit>  and the recently reported 'hong anliu'  <cit> . 'hong anliu' is a spontaneous bud mutant from its wild type 'anliu' sweet orange. we found that lycopene in the 'hong anliu' mutant was 1000-fold higher than that in its wild type fruits, and in juice sacs the lycopene accumulation was coincided with increased expression of upstream carotenogenic genes and reduced expression of downstream genes  <cit> . thereafter, transcriptional study including cdna microarray in combination with suppression subtraction hybridization  was used to investigate gene expression changes in the mutant, and a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were detected  <cit> . more recently, massively parallel signature sequencing was applied to decipher the transcriptome changes between wt and mt; and the results indicated that partial impairment of lycopene downstream flux are critical for the formation of lycopene accumulation trait in the mutant  <cit> . meanwhile, comparative proteomic analyses were performed between the mutant and its wild type. and the proteomic data, when considered in combination with transcriptional data, suggest that post-transcriptional regulations are involved in shaping the red-flesh trait of the orange mutant  <cit> . however, it remains largely unknown what kind of post-transcriptional mechanism was involved in the red-flesh mutant. so far, one interesting case has been reported in arabidopsis where mirna was proposed to regulate the expression of apetala <dig> transcription factor  in controlling a key carotenoids biosynthesis gene   <cit> . but to date, very little is known about mirnas or mirna-mediated molecular processes that regulate lycopene accumulation in plant fruits.

small rnas  are emerging as important regulators of biological processes on post-transcriptional level in most eukaryotes  <cit> . in plants, srnas are involved in a variety of activities that are essential for genome stability, development, and adaptive responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . there is still increasing data for the implication of srnas in the regulation of other biological processes  <cit> .

based on difference of biogenesis and action, srnas have been mainly grouped into two categories, microrna  and short interfering rna   <cit> . mirnas distinguish from sirnas by their biogenesis. mirnas are cleaved from stem-loop precursor molecules that derive from single-stranded rnas, while sirnas are generated from double-strand rna precursors  <cit> . in plants, mirna regulates gene expression mostly on post-transcription level  <cit> . the majority of the mirnas initially isolated from model plant arabidopsis thaliana was found to be evolutionarily conserved across plant species  <cit> . later, many researches suggested that the mirna repertoire of plant species comprises a set of non-conserved mirnas besides the conserved ones  <cit> . to date,  <dig> mirna sequences have been identified from  <dig> plant species, as revealed from mirna registry database . however, no citrus mirnas have been found in this database so far.

plant mirnas have been identified mostly by two strategies: traditional sanger sequencing of the small rna libraries as for arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and poplar  <cit> ; and computational prediction of conserved mirnas by searching for homologous sequences using est or genomic sequences  <cit> . however, the computation-based approach is mostly limited to the discovery of conserved mirnas; and the small-scale traditional sequencing approach identified mainly conserved mirnas, as suggested by morin et al.  <cit>  and moxon et al.  <cit> . recently developed high-throughput sequencing technology has allowed the discovery of several non-conserved or lowly expressed mirnas as well as quantification of the expression of mirnas. this strategy has been successfully applied to both model plants  <cit> , and non-model plants  <cit> .

the criteria for mirnas characterization and annotation in plants have been advanced since plants have relatively large and complex srna populations within which mirnas are often a minority  <cit> . the minimum criteria include biogenesis criterion that mirna precursors can be folded into stem-loop structure, and expression criterion that mature mirnas should be detected by northern blotting, qrt-pcr or sequencing  <cit> . proof of biogenesis requires data of the cloning or detection of mirna* sequences, which is complementary to mirna sequences in the precursor molecule  <cit> . expression detection can also be done by recently developed qrt-pcr-based methods  <cit> , where each mirna is reverse-transcribed from total rna using a specific stem-loop primer, followed by pcr amplification and detection. this method is believed to be a powerful alternative for sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective detection of mirna  <cit> . target prediction can be an ancillary criterion for mirna annotation. sequence complementarity between mirnas and their target genes is very high in plants, which has made the search for plant mirna target genes a straightforward process  <cit> . a number of prediction algorithms are available publicly for plant mirna target prediction, such as miru  <cit> , wmd <dig>  <cit> , and uea plant srna toolkit  <cit> .

here we described the deep sequencing of srnas from a red-flesh sweet orange mutant and its wild type. comparative profiling of the srna transcriptome between wild type and mutant revealed a set of  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas showing significant expression changes. the annotation of the potential targets of differential mirnas indicated that high ranked genes are that implicated in biological processes including carotenoid biosynthesis, transcription regulation, and photosynthesis.

RESULTS
sequencing and annotation of sweet orange small rnas
our previous studies showed that the stage of  <dig> days after flowering  is the critical stage for the phenotype of color break and global gene expression changes during fruit development in the mutant   <cit> . in this study, srna libraries were generated from fruit pulps of 'anliu' sweet orange  and its red-flesh mutant  'hong anliu' at  <dig> daf stage. deep sequencing of small rna libraries yielded  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unfiltered sequence reads for wt and mt, respectively. the raw srna data were submitted to gene expression omnibus  under accession no. gse <dig>  after discarding low quality sequences containing ambiguous nucleotides, sequences shorter than  <dig> nucleotides, and sequences counts below  <dig> in both libraries,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  reliable sequences were remained for analysis. these sequences represented  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique srna sequences in wt and mt, respectively. the distribution of unique srna length is summarized in figure  <dig>  the overall distribution pattern was similar between wt and mt, i.e. the majority of srnas  were 21- <dig> nt in length with 24-nt srna as the major peak.

the unique srnas were further classified into different rna categories . analysis showed that  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the unique srnas matched the citrus sinensis unigenes . detailed information was shown in additional file  <dig> and  <dig>  further analysis using the srna sequences searching against rfam database revealed that  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the sequences for wt and mt, respectively, matched noncoding rnas including rrna, trna, snrna and snornas . searching the remaining srnas from wt and mt against mirbase v <dig>  identified  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the unique sequences matched known mirnas, which account  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total srnas, respectively .

known mirnas
we identified  <dig> mirnas, belonging to  <dig> familes, in sweet orange by blast against the mirbase v <dig>  using our combined  srna sequences . the potential conserved mirnas were used for blastn against sweet orange unigene dataset to search precursor sequences . since the orange genome is largely unknown, we used orange unigene dataset  and  <dig> Ã— coverage sequence of sweet orange  to predict rna secondary structures. the sequences of perfect match with srna sequences were used for fold-back structure prediction by mfold program  <cit> . the mirna-containing fold-back structures were shown in additional file  <dig> 

to compare the mirna abundance in different libraries, the count of each mirna was normalized to transcripts per million . in the wt srna library, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were the most overrepresented families, with the abundance at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  tpm, respectively. these three mirna families also frequently represented in mt srna library, but the difference is that the mir <dig> abundance ranked third  after mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  in the library. it is interesting that in both libraries mir <dig> was the most frequent mirna which constituted nearly 32% of the mirna transcriptome of sweet orange.

the  <dig> mirna families from sweet orange were compared with those from  <dig> other plant species . generally, the orange mirnas had corresponding homolog in at least one plant species; one mirna mir <dig> only has homolog in phylogenetically distant species physcomitrella. moreover, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were extraordinary that they only have homolog genes in chlamydomonas which belongs to protista kingdom. these data suggest that some orange mirnas are ancient. sweet orange was phylogenetically close to arabidopsis which have  <dig> mirna genes in mirbase v <dig>  database; comparison between them showed that  <dig> mirna familes were conserved between them. when comparing with the  <dig> mirna genes from another fruit crop grapevine,  <dig> of them were conserved between sweet orange and grapevine .

putative targets of mirnas were determined using publicly available algorithms including miru  <cit>  and wmd <dig>  <cit> . of the  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> had putative targets, with the exception of mir167a, mir845b, and mir1520c . many putative targets are transcription factors and homologs of known mirna target genes in other plant species, such as sbp for mir <dig>  nac for mir <dig>  bzip for mir <dig>  ap <dig> for mir <dig> and f-box for mir <dig>  one occasional case in grapevine  <cit>  was also observed in sweet orange: csi-mir <dig> was predicted to target squamosa promoter-binding protein-like  gene while not target to a brassinosteroid signaling regulator as that firstly reported in moss  <cit> .

novel mirnas
after excluding the rrna, trna, snrna, snornas and known mirnas, the remained srna sequences were used to blast search on orange unigenes and  <dig> Ã— coverage sequence of sweet orange ; and secondary structure prediction were done for each locus using the criteria described by jones-rhoades et al.  <cit> . this analysis revealed that  <dig> srna sequences were perfectly matched ests and could be folded into stem-loop structures . search of complementary mirna* sequences showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate mirnas were detected . based on the criteria of loci with stem-loop structure producing sequenced mature mirna and mirna* species as described in meyers et al.  <cit> , these  <dig> sequences were considered as novel mirnas.

a count was normalized as transcripts per million .

all the  <dig> novel mirnas had a predicted target in at least one orange est sequence . putative targets of four mirnas were transcription factors, including nac for csi-novel- <dig> and csi-novel- <dig>  aux/iaa tf for csi-novel- <dig> and yabby for csi-novel- <dig>  it is notable that one mirna potentially target disease resistance genes, i.e. csi-novel- <dig> predicted to target on serine/threonine kinase gene.

to confirm the expression of the novel mirnas, we analyzed the expression of all the  <dig> novel mirnas using stem-loop qrt-pcr. all the genes could be detected by qrt-pcr . of the  <dig> novel mirnas,  <dig> genes showed similar expression pattern to that revealed from sequencing data of the srna libraries. the electrophoresis of the qrt-pcr products confirmed the size and expression of these novel mirnas . moreover, we analyzed the expression of three mirna*s ; and results showed that two mirna*s had different expression pattern from those of corresponding mature mirnas .

mirna-targets associated small rnas
to compare the frequency of small rnas located in mirna-target genes with other genes, we mined the unique small rnas  that matched perfectly to mirna-target genes in sense or antisense strands according to luo et al.  <cit> . target prediction of the  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas produced a total of  <dig> mirna-target genes. then all the  <dig> mirna-target genes were searched against the unigenes on which srnas were mapped. this analysis in wt showed that  <dig>  srnas in sense and  <dig>  srnas in antisense were mapped perfectly on orange unigenes . of the mapped unigenes in wt,  <dig> were mirna-target genes:  <dig> of them produced srnas in sense strand,  <dig> in antisense and  <dig> in both sense and antisense . for mt sample,  <dig>  and  <dig>  srnas were mapped in sense and antisense, respectively . similar analysis revealed that  <dig> mirna-target genes match srnas perfectly, with  <dig> in sense strand,  <dig> in antisense and  <dig> in both strand . this study showed that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the mirna-target genes in wt and mt could be the precursors of srnas. the high frequency of mirna-targets associated srnas suggests that mirna-target genes are hotspots for generation of srnas.

mt mirna
a all the  <dig> mirna-target genes were used for analysis, detailed gene id see in additional file  <dig> 

differentially expressed mirnas between wt and mt
the frequency of each mirnas in the small rna library could serve as an index for the estimation of the relative expression abundance of mirnas. to investigate the expression change of mirnas between wt and mt, the abundance of each mirna was normalized as transcripts per million . a total of  <dig> known mirna genes and  <dig> novel mirnas were up- or down-regulated significantly at  <dig>  level based on z-score statistics . among these  <dig> differentially expressed genes,  <dig> mirnas showed a two-fold or greater  expression difference between mt and wt. table  <dig> summarized the  <dig> mirnas with the most significant expression changes between wt and mt.

a count was normalized as transcripts per million .

to confirm the expression difference of the mirna, we analyzed the expression of  <dig> known mirna genes using stem-loop qrt-pcr in addition to the  <dig> novel mirna genes described earlier. the expression level of each gene in the mt and wt was compared with its abundance from the sequencing data of the srna library. results showed that among the  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas have the same expression pattern in wt and mt as that from sequencing data .

annotation of potential targets of differentially expressed mirnas
functional annotations were further performed to investigate which processes are differentially regulated by mirnas in the mutant. a total of  <dig> potential target genes were predicted based on the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas in sweet orange . interestingly, the potential targets included two important carotenogenic genes, i.e. geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase  gene which targeted by csi-mir <dig> and lycopene Î²-cyclase  gene which targeted by csi-mir <dig>  to evaluate the potential functions of these mirna-target genes, gene ontology  categories were assigned to the putative targets of the  <dig> differentially expressed mirna genes according to the method described by morin et al.  <cit> . figure  <dig> summarized the categorization of mirna-target genes according to the cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. based on molecular function, the genes were finally classified into  <dig> categories, as shown in figure 5b; the most three over-represented go terms are metal ion binding, nucleic acid binding, and transcription factor activity. categories based on biological processes revealed that the mirna-target genes were related to  <dig> biological processes; the most three frequent terms are regulation of transcription, signal transduction, protein modification . moreover, go representations from this study were compared with that based on all the public unigenes from sweet orange in tigr gene index database http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/go_browser.pl?species=orange&gi_dir=csgi; the analysis revealed that the striking differences lies in the high percentage of nucleus, plastid and chloroplast for cellular component, and overpresentation of regulation of transcription, protein modification and photosynthesis for biological process in this study.

the biological interpretation of the target genes of differential mirnas was further completed using kegg pathway analysis. a total of  <dig> different metabolic pathways were found , of which some were consistent with biological processes that already revealed by go analysis. the most represented pathways included carbon fixation , fatty acid metabolism , flavonoid biosynthesis , terpenoid biosynthesis , and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis .

bthe putative target genes of mirna genes which differentially expressed significant at  <dig>  level between the mutant and wild type

high ranked target genes of the differentially expressed mirnas were those implicated in three biological processes including regulation of transcription, protein modification and photosynthesis. it is easy to understand the high frequency of terms 'regulation of transcription' and 'protein modification' since mirna are involved in diverse regulatory events  <cit> . however, the biological process of photosynthesis needs to be verified. moreover, two carotenogenic genes were also predicted to be targeted by mirnas. we further analyzed one gene involved in the carbon fixation  and another gene involved in carotenoid biosynthesis . the results showed that the expression profiles of mirnas are complementary to the profiles of their target genes , implied the possible roles of mirnas in regulation of the biological processes that involved in shaping the mutant trait in sweet orange.

discussion
we have characterized the small rna transcriptome in a red-flesh mutant that with abnormal pattern of lycopene accumulation and its wild type. with deep sequencing strategy by illumina platform, it provides us not only large number of conserved mirnas but also novel mirnas. to the author's knowledge, this is the first report of cloning and characterization of large scale srnas and identification of novel mirnas from sweet orange. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> million srnas were obtained from wt and mt, respectively; and the size distribution of small rnas  is quite similar to those published from phylogenetically close plant species such as arabidopsis  <cit> , with the total percentage of 21- <dig> nt srnas being more than 90% and percentage of  <dig> nt srnas over 50%. this suggests that the illumina sequencing data of srna libraries was reliable.

mirnaome in sweet orange
in this study,  <dig> conserved mirnas belonging  <dig> families as well as  <dig> novel mirna families were identified in sweet orange. the mirnas cloned in this study were compared with those from previously reported citrus mirnas  <cit> , of them four sweet orange mirnas were not overlap with this study. these results suggest that at least  <dig> mirnas exist in the mirna transcriptome  of sweet orange. we believe that this is a conservative estimate since only fruit samples were used in this study. the mirna species in wild type and mutant was different, i.e.  <dig> mirnas were detected in wt sample while  <dig> mirnas were in mt sample. moreover, the expression levels of each mirna varied greatly within the transcriptome, i.e. in mt the abundance ranged from  <dig>  tpm for csi-mir <dig> to  <dig> tpm for csi-mir <dig>  all these data implied that mirnaome, as small rna transcriptome  <cit> , is distinct and complex though mirna sequences are believed to be conserved across different plant families  <cit> .

take a broader view on the small rna transcriptome of sweet orange, we noticed that the size distribution pattern of srnas from sweet orange  is quite similar to arabidopsis as described earlier  <cit> ; however, the distribution pattern is strikingly different from that in pinus contorta, a conifer species  <cit>  where 24-nt rnas was less frequently  and 21-nt rnas were more abundant . the striking difference also existed when compare the sweet orange small rna transcriptome with another gymnosperm plant species, chinese yew   <cit> . when compared with monocot species rice, the difference is less severe but still exists, i.e. in rice 24-nt srnas has the highest percentage  followed by the 21-nt srnas   <cit> . these analyses indicated that the small rna transcriptome is complicated across plant species and can be significantly different between phylogenetically-distant plant families.

a total of  <dig> novel mirnas were identified from sweet orange, as evidenced from the biogenesis characteristics of mirnas including the stem-loop structure of the pre-mirnas  and sequencing of the mirna* in the libraries. the expression of all the  <dig> mirnas was also detected by qrt-pcr analyses. additional qrt-pcr analyses of mirna*s revealed that some mirna* species can accumulated at certain levels in fruits; moreover, the expression pattern of mirna*s in wt and mt fruits can be different from that of mirnas. for example, csi-novel- <dig> has lower expression in mt  than in wt  as confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis; in contrast, csi-novel-05* has higher expression in mt  than in wt  which was also confirmed by qrt-pcr. the differential accumulation of mirnas and mirna*s may be due to the different activities of key enzyme in the srna-pathway, as shown in rice that the differential expression of ago genes in different tissues might cause the change of mirna*s abundance  <cit> .

mirna-targets are hot spots for generating srnas
the relationship of srna genes and the mirna target genes is one of the hot topics in the phenomenon of "mirna-associated transitivity"  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the mirna putative target genes generated srnas. this data implied that mirna target gene could be hot spots for generating srnas. moreover, high percentage of antisense srnas was associated with the mirna-target genes, with  <dig> % and  <dig> % for wt and mt, respectively. the antisense srnas/transcripts can function in post-transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> . the post-transcriptional gene silencing is mainly caused by formation of dsrna duplexes; this could be supported from the observation that 75% of the antisense srnas have their cognate sense transcripts in wt and 64% happens in mt sample in this study.

mirnas in plant fruits
up to now, mirna identification in fruits using a cloning approach is rare except in tomato  <cit>  and grape  <cit> . in this study, cloning from sweet orange fruit led to the identification of  <dig> conserved mirna families. analysis of them revealed that  <dig> mirna families are expressed in fruits of the three plant species; but they are not fruit-specific. furthermore, the comparison between the two fruit crops  showed that  <dig> mirna families are expressed in fruits of both crops, and only mir <dig> is specific to the two species. these analyses suggested that expression and function of fruit-specific mirnas across plant species is lacking, and mirnas involved in fruit ripening may overlap with that function in other organs, or the same mirnas in different organs may have different functions.

mirnas possibly involved in the regulation of lycopene accumulation in the sweet orange red-flesh mutant
the characterization and comparative profiling of entire sets of small rnas , especially the microrna transcriptome, lays the foundation to unravel the complex mirna-mediated regulatory networks controlling lycopene accumulation in the red-flesh sweet orange mutant. in this study, a number of mirnas have been identified to be differentially expressed between 'anliu' sweet orange  and its red-flesh mutant . compared with wt,  <dig> known mirna genes and one novel mirna genes were expressed exclusively in mt. on the other hand, we found  <dig> known mirnas and two novel mirnas were wt-specific. moreover, a total of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were found to exhibit significant expression changes between mt and wt.

target prediction of these differential mirnas could provide information on the biological processes regulated by mirna. putative targets were predicted by psrnatarget   <cit>  and web mirna designer   <cit> . this strategy was also used in arabidopsis for the identification of nutrient-responsive mirnas and their potential targets  <cit> , though further direct validation is necessary to elucidate the true in-vivo targets. however, the annotations of these potential mirna target genes did provide an alternate view of gene regulation of the red-flesh trait formation in mt . we found that three groups of predicted mirna-target genes are most possibly involved in the mutant trait formation of lycopene accumulation. the first interesting observation is that two potential targets  are the key enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway . they encode geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase , a key enzyme for the production of prerequisite molecules for carotenoids accumulation, and lycopene Î²-cyclase , a rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of lycopene to downstream cyclic carotenes. the expression of lycb and csi-mir <dig> also indicated possible interaction between them because of the complementary expression profile . and we also detected the ggps gene expression, but failed due to the incorrect sequence information in the current public database. the second interesting target genes are apetala <dig>  transcription factors, including ey <dig> by csi-novel- <dig>  and tc <dig> by csi-mir172a. in arabidopsis, one ap <dig> protein  has been experimentally validated to interact with phytoene synthase  gene, which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of carotenoids. the rap <dig>  gene was also believed to be regulated by mirna because of the large discrepancy between mrna and protein levels in the overexpression lines  <cit> . the data from this study also supported the proposition, and indicated that rap <dig>   is a potential target of mirna172a in sweet orange. the third group of target genes is those involved in photosynthesis or carbon fixation . the potential target genes associated with photosynthesis fits well with the go results with large number of genes that are located in chloroplast or plastid. moreover, our photosynthesis-related gene expression analysis and in situ detection of the photosynthetic rate confirmed that photosynthesis in mt is stronger than that in wt . the result is quite consistent with our gas chromatographic analyses that the sugars in juice sacs are higher in mt than in wt  <cit> . tomato hp- <dig> mutant which manifested with increased carotenoids, primarily lycopene, showed that genes related with photosynthesis are consistently up-regulated throughout fruit ripening  <cit> . all these evidences implied the important role of photosynthesis in the accumulation of lycopene. taken together, the annotation of the potential targets of differentially expressed mirna genes between wt and mt indicated that several mirna-directed biological processes including carotenoid biosynthesis, transcription regulation, and photosynthesis may be important for the regulation of lycopene accumulation in the sweet orange red-flesh mutant.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a large scale cloning and characterization of mirnas in sweet orange. the interpretation of the small rna data uncovered a total of  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas. meanwhile, comparative profiling of these mirnas between a spontaneous red-flesh mutant and its wild type revealed that  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas are differentially expressed. target prediction of the  <dig> differential mirnas indicated that two key genes of the carotenoid biosynthesis, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase  and lycopene Î²-cyclase , are under mirna regulation. functional annotation of the  <dig> target genes of differential mirna revealed that high ranked biological processes are transcription regulation, protein modification and photosynthesis. the expression of mirnas and target genes involved in photosynthesis and carotenogenesis were further confirmed. taken together, this study provides new insight into the mirnaome and possible mirna-directed molecular processes that regulate lycopene accumulation in the red-flesh sweet orange mutant.
