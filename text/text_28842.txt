BACKGROUND
cardiomyopathy syndrome  is a severe cardiac disease affecting atlantic salmon . since its first diagnosis in norway  <dig>  <cit> , it has also been diagnosed in sea farms in scotland, the faroe island, denmark and canada  <cit> . cms primarily affects farmed fish from  <dig> to  <dig> months after transfer to sea water  <cit> , but cases of cms in wild salmon have also been observed  <cit> .

the diagnosis of cms is based on cardiac histopathology, characterised by severe inflammation and necrosis of the spongy myocardium of the atrium and ventricle  <cit> . inflammatory infiltrates consist of mononuclear cells, probably lymphocytes and macrophages. the compact layer of the ventricle is usually less affected, and always occurs later than changes in the spongious layer  <cit> . farmed salmon suffering from cms often lack clinical signs and may die suddenly due to rupture of the atrium or sinus venosus resulting in cardiac tamponade  <cit> . other symptoms like skin haemorrhages, raised scales and oedema have also been reported  <cit> . at necropsy, ascitic fluid, fibrinous perihepatitis and blood clots on the liver and heart are typical findings  <cit> . the first study indicating a transmissible nature of the disease, showed typical cardiac lesions in salmon post-smolts six weeks post injection of cardiac and kidney homogenate from cms-diseased fish  <cit> .

recently a novel virus associated with cms was cultured and identified  <cit> . the proposed virus named piscine myocarditis virus  is a double-stranded rna virus with structural similarities suggesting assignment to the totiviridae family. in this study, viral rna could be detected by quantitative real-time rt-pcr  from  <dig> weeks post challenge, peaking at 6- <dig> weeks post challenge, coinciding with the increase of histopathological lesions in the heart. virus particles were also detected by in situ hybridization in degenerate and necrotic cardiac myocytes from field outbreaks of cms.

in the present study, the same pmcv inoculum was used to experimentally reproduce cms and to characterise the host immune response in infected salmon post-smolts. to gain an understanding of the immune response and host-virus interaction, a genome-wide approach based on oligonucleotide microarrays was used  <cit> . six gene sets representing different arms of the immune response were identified, and temporal and spatial regulation was evaluated in combination with histology and relative quantification of viral rna. the findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the immune response against pmcv in atlantic salmon, and pathological and protective correlates thereof.

RESULTS
experimental cms infection
no mortality or clinical signs associated with cms was observed. potential contamination by other pathogens was excluded by qpcr for known viruses and bacteria from relevant organs and numbers of samples. histopathological examination of heart was scored 0- <dig> according to severity of cms lesions, as summarised in figure  <dig>  results were used for evaluation of the infection challenge and for design of gene expression analyses. in control groups, one fish had moderate to severe cardiac lesions at  <dig> wpi, and was graded score  <dig> in the spongy layer of the ventricle and score  <dig> in the atrium. for all the other control fish, only score  <dig> and  <dig> were observed. no statistical difference between replicate control groups was found.

groups receiving pmcv inoculum developed cardiac lesions consistent with cms from  <dig> wpi and onwards. at  <dig> wpi, 63% of the infected fish had moderate lesions  in the atrium . lesions were first found in the atrium and subsequently in the spongy layer of the ventricle. the peak of histopathological lesions was observed at  <dig> wpi, with moderate atrial lesions  in 36%, and severe lesions  in 32% of the fish. in the subsequent time points, fewer fish had cardiac lesions, and at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> wpi, respectively  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the fish were scored  <dig>  at  <dig> wpi, only mild focal lesions  were described in the atrium and spongy ventricle. in general, lesions were first found in the atrium and were more severe than in the spongious layer. differences between group  <dig> and  <dig> were significant for atrial lesions at  <dig> wpi and epicardial lesions at  <dig> wpi. lesions in atrium of control groups  <dig> and  <dig> versus infected groups  <dig> and  <dig> were statistically different for all time points except  <dig> wpi, with highest significance between  <dig> and  <dig> wpi . a similar difference was found in spongious lesions with highest significance between  <dig> and  <dig> wpi. lesions in epicardium differed significantly between infected and controls at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> wpi.

viral load
pmcv levels were analysed by qpcr to document viral replication in heart during infection and in the different tissues at early infection  and peak pathology  stages . the same six individuals per time point as used for gene expression analyses were tested. since  <dig> wpi and the two latest time points  were not included in microarray analysis, six randomly chosen samples from group  <dig> and  <dig> were tested respectively. at  <dig> wpi,  <dig> out of  <dig> fish were positive for viral rna in heart . levels increased strongly until  <dig> wpi and then gradually until  <dig> wpi , concurrent with the onset of histopathological changes. levels reached a plateau phase between  <dig> and  <dig> wpi with no significant changes in viral rna. from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi, levels were significantly reduced, indicating a clearance of virus. one week later , both viral load and individual variance were reduced. for most time points, individual variation in viral rna was observed, analogous to the variation observed for histopathology score. correlation between histopathology scores and viral ct levels in heart was highly significant  .

comparison of viral loads between tissues showed highest and equal viral loads in heart, spleen and kidney . significantly lower and equal levels of viral rna were found in blood cells  and liver. except for heart , viral loads were not significantly different between  <dig> and  <dig> wpi in any of the tissues investigated.

identification of gene sets representing immune pathways
the main purpose of the gene expression study was to identify gene sets representing different immune pathways and characterise their regulation over the time course of cms in the infected organs. fish were challenged by injection to ensure simultaneous infection and virus dose. since histomorphological changes were investigated in cardiac tissue, rna from infected versus control heart samples from six time points  were used for microarray analysis. in order to examine responses in fish with similar disease status and infection level, individuals with highest histology scores and viral loads were selected from the time points when pathological changes were significant . after microarray experiments,  <dig> differentially expressed genes with a mean log2-er > | <dig> | in at least one time point were selected. genes implicated in different immune pathways were defined in the resulting list using the stars software package  <cit> , which contains custom annotation of genes on the microarray based on go classes, kegg pathways, mining of literature and public databases and experimental evidence . further, immune genes were arranged in seven sets taking into account both functions and the expression profiles. six gene sets  showed differential expression between at least two subsequent time points , while one gene set  was excluded since no significant temporal changes were found. the log2-er for all genes per gene set and time point were combined from microarray results of the two sample pools  and four sample pools . the resulting expression profiles of the six gene sets are shown as box plots in figure  <dig>  gene composition and temporal regulation for each gene set is presented in the following section.

composition and temporal regulation of immune pathways
1: early antiviral and interferon response
this gene set included  <dig> genes associated with nonspecific innate immunity related to the early antiviral and interferon  responses. this also included predicted pattern recognition receptors  and associated genes, and early induced virus-responsive genes known from other salmonid viral disease profiles in our microarray database . the expression profile showed strongest upregulation at the early stages which levelled off during infection . a median log2-er + <dig>  at  <dig> wpi decreased to + <dig>  at  <dig> wpi. this level remained unchanged until  <dig> wpi followed by a significant decrease to + <dig>  at  <dig> wpi. a heat map showing the expression of ten genes is given in figure  <dig>  these were selected either by random or based on their functional importance as evidenced from other studies in fish or higher vertebrates. early upregulation of the cytoplasmic rna helicases retinoic acid inducible gene i  and melanoma differentiation-associated gene  <dig>  involved in sensing and degradation of viral rna, as well as a gene similar to the membrane-bound toll-like receptor  <dig>  implied activation of virus recognition receptors and antiviral signalling. several genes known to be activated in response to ifn signalling were upregulated, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 1a , myxovirus resistance gene mx, interferon-inducible protein gig2-like and radical s-adenosyl methionine domain-containing protein  <dig>  also known as viperin. a similar expression profile was also observed for a suit of genes known to be induced by ifn but with unknown roles in fish immunity, such as interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats  <dig>  and very large inducible gtpase  <dig> . a transcript encoding the  <dig> kda ro protein was one of several trim/ring finger genes highly induced at  <dig> and  <dig> wpi, supporting the role of this multi-gene family in early virus recognition and host defence  <cit> .

2: complement response
twenty-two genes associated with the complement system were not differentially regulated at  <dig> wpi followed by a gradual upregulation from  <dig> wpi which peaked at  <dig> wpi , concurrent with the onset of cardiac pathology. in subsequent time points expression levelled off, with a weak but significant induction at  <dig> wpi coinciding with pathology peak . the upregulation at  <dig> wpi was significantly stronger compared to earlier and later time points. the heat map of representative genes  shows activation of genes with different roles in the complement system: antigen: antibody-complex binding by c1q; activating enzymes c2b and c1r/s; membrane-binding proteins and peptide-inflammatory mediators c3a/4a/5a, c <dig>  c3- <dig> and c <dig> pre-protein; and membrane-attack protein by c8b.

3: b cell response
this gene set included  <dig> genes involved in differentiation and regulation of b cells and antigen recognition by immunoglobulins. the expression profile was characterised by upregulation at two time points; during early infection  <dig> wpi and at peak pathology  <dig> wpi . the later peak was stronger with median log2-er + <dig>  compared to + <dig>  at  <dig> wpi. the two peaks were separated by the complement activation at  <dig> wpi. immunoglobulin-related genes, represented with  <dig> distinct transcripts, comprised a large part of this group . genes related to antigen receptor signalling included hematopoietic lineage cell-specific  protein  and kelch-like protein  <dig>  . similar function was predicted for several genes with src homology-3/ <dig>  domains and activities, such as src kinase-associated phosphoprotein  <dig>  and dual adapter for phosphotyrosine and 3-phosphotyrosine and 3-phosphoinositide . the tyrosine-protein kinase lyn also plays a regulatory role in b cell receptor response after antigen binding. the cd <dig> antigen, which is expressed in many b cell subsets and in plasma cells in mammals  <cit> , was strongest induced at the early peak. the opposite was found for cd <dig> antigen precursor, suggesting that it may have a role in activated b and t cells.

4: mhc antigen presentation
this gene set included  <dig> genes involved in processing and presentation of viral antigens via mhc class i and ii. the expression profile was similar to that of b cell response, but with less difference in average induction levels between the two peaks at  <dig> and  <dig> wpi, respectively log2-er + <dig>  and + <dig>  . besides, these genes were significantly upregulated already at the earliest time point . the gene set was dominated by genes related to the mhc class i pathway, such as antigen processing by proteasome components psmbs/taps, and antigen presentation by the mhc class i heavy chain and light chain beta-2-microglobulin . examples of mhc class ii related genes were a salmon homologue to the hla class ii histocompatibility antigen gamma chain and cathepsin s precursor, a lysosomal cysteine peptidase involved in degradation of peptides for antigenic presentation on mhc class ii molecules  <cit> .

5: t cell response
the fifth gene set included  <dig> genes with known or presumed roles in the regulation and effector functions of t lymphocytes. the expression profile showed a slight but significant upregulation from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi which increased by additional + <dig> median log2-er at  <dig> wpi and reached maximum of + <dig>  log2-er induction at  <dig> wpi . this peak coincided with highest levels of the mhc antigen presentation and b cell response genes, and the time points when viral load and cardiac pathology were peaking. from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi gene expression dropped significantly. all classes of effector t cells seemed to be activated from  <dig> wpi onwards; cytotoxic  cells by induction of interferon gamma, granzyme and cd <dig> beta and t helper cells by induction of cd <dig> t cell surface glycoprotein . upregulation of other genes with common regulatory roles in t cell activation included cd <dig> antigens, t cell receptor genes, cd <dig> t-cell specific surface glycoprotein and the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase lck.

6: apoptosis
a group of  <dig> genes functionally linked to apoptotic pathways showed a coregulated expression pattern with the t cell response gene set, and was assumed to be involved in controlling cell death of t lymphocytes and/or host target cells, as their maximum induction coincided with the histopathology peak . this gene set included several genes from the family of tnf receptors and caspases, with central roles in the execution phase of apoptosis . interestingly, the majority of genes was linked to the family of rho gtpases, with recently established roles in controlling t cell regulation and apoptosis, e.g. rho-related gtp-binding protein rhof and g precursors, cdc <dig> small effector  <dig>  rho gtpase-activating protein  <dig>  regulator of g-protein signalling  <dig>  and several genes related to the ras superfamily . other important regulators of programmed cell death in immunity which were activated included the tnf decoy receptor  and the programmed cell death  <dig> ligand  <dig> precursor cd <dig> 

tissue regulation of immune pathways
next, we analysed the tissue-specific features of immune transcriptome responses during cms. two rna sample pools  from the same organs as tested for viral load were analysed by microarrays from two time points; before the onset of cardiac pathology at  <dig> wpi and at peak of cardiac pathology/viral load at  <dig> wpi. the six gene sets outlined in the time course study were examined , and their expression profiles are shown as box plots in figure  <dig>  early antiviral and ifn-dependent genes were induced in all tissues, with significantly higher median log2-er at  <dig> wpi compared to  <dig> wpi . levels at  <dig> wpi were similar in kidney, heart, spleen and blood, being lower in the liver. mhc antigen presentation also responded to infection in all examined tissues and, except for heart, levels were generally stronger at  <dig> versus  <dig> wpi . the remaining functional groups showed restricted expression changes. the complement response was upregulated in spleen at the peak of pathology  <dig> wpi . genes associated with b cells were upregulated in heart and at both time points . they also showed a weak but significant induction in kidney at  <dig> wpi and in rbc at  <dig> wpi. the t cell and apoptosis gene sets showed similar expression profiles, with induction in heart which was strongest at peak pathology  <dig> wpi when compared to  <dig> wpi . in addition, a significant though relatively weak increase was found in rbc between  <dig> and  <dig> wpi. similar to the b cell response, kidney showed a transient induction at  <dig> wpi.

real-time qpcr analyses
to verify the microarray results, six differentially expressed genes were analysed by qpcr in the four sample pools from  <dig> wpi. the results produced with two independent methods were in close concordance . the coefficient of linear regression was close to unity  while correlation and linear dependency were highly significant . the qpcr analyses also assessed the individual variation and relationship between viral load and gene expression changes at  <dig> wpi. six genes encoding putative antiviral and ifn-dependent genes from gene set  <dig> were selected due to high induction levels at this early time point. relative expression of rig-i, mda <dig>  stat1a, ifit <dig>  rsad <dig> and baf was determined in  <dig> individuals from cms infected groups  <dig> and  <dig> versus the same control pool as used for the microarray experiments  . these genes were strongly induced in all fish with median fold changes from + <dig>  to + <dig>  . at this time point, no significant histopathological changes were observed, and equal numbers of individuals had histopathology scores of  <dig> or  <dig>  as expected, none of the analysed genes showed significantly different expression between fish with histopathological scores  <dig> and  <dig> . viral load in heart varied between ct 19- <dig> in these individuals, and gene expression levels and virus ct values were strongly correlated for all six genes . this implied that genes were activated as a result of increased viral replication and suggested that they might represent markers of early infection status.

mrna levels  of six genes  from  <dig> individual fish were tested for correlation  against viral loads  at  <dig> wpi.

discussion
this study addressed the temporal and spatial development of immune responses assessed by transcriptome changes during experimental piscine myocarditis virus infection. the regulation of immune pathways was compared to the disease status evaluated by histopathology and viral load, aiming at a comprehensive understanding of the host-virus interactions. these results provide a framework for in-depth functional studies on immunity and for evaluation of preventive strategies such as vaccination and nutritional intervention during cms in atlantic salmon.

challenge trial and infection
since the discovery of cms, its diagnosis has been based on clinical findings and cardiac histopathology  <cit> . a virus with structural similarities to the totiviridae family named pmcv was recently identified as the presumed causative agent of cms  <cit> . thus, pathogenesis and disease progression can now be more thoroughly evaluated by combining virus-specific qpcr with histology. it should be noted that due to difficulties with pmcv cultivation in vitro, virus titration has not been successful yet . consequently, the relative expression of viral rna in this study could not be related to actual numbers of viral particles. cardiac histopathology showed moderate to severe lesions consistent with cms  exclusively in infected groups, with only one exception in control groups at  <dig> wpi. furthermore, replicate groups were very similar to each other with respect to histopathology score. significant differences between group replicates were only observed between infected groups at two time points . the differences between infected and control groups were mainly associated with lesions in the atrium and spongy layer of the ventricle, which were highly significant from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi and  <dig> to  <dig> wpi, respectively. as expected, no lesions were observed in the compact layer of the ventricle, and lesions in epicardium were less prominent. these results are coherent with the pathology as described from clinical outbreaks and previous challenge trials with cms  <cit> .

after the peak in histology score at 8- <dig> wpi, lesions declined gradually suggesting the onset of a recovery phase. this was supported from qpcr analysis of viral load which followed the same pattern: increased replication until  <dig> wpi followed by a plateau phase until  <dig> wpi, and finally decreasing levels to the end point of the challenge trial. thus, the strong correlation between histopathology and viral load which peaked concurrently with the activation of t cell pathway genes, suggest that the observed cardiac lesions resulted from virus cytopathic effects and necrosis of infected myocytes, triggering an inflammatory response followed by activation of t-cell mediated immunity. examination of viral loads across different tissues showed equally high levels of viral rna in kidney and spleen as compared to heart, while liver and blood cells had lower levels. however, increased replication from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi was only observed in heart, supporting that this organ was the main site of virus propagation  <cit> . however, heart may not be the primary replication site, since viral rna was detected in all tissues and blood cells early after infection. high infection levels in kidney and spleen are typical for viral diseases in salmon, and are probably related to their roles in attracting primary infected/antigen presenting cells and priming lymphocytes for specific immunity. from a challenge trial with the recently described piscine reovirus   <cit> , higher viral loads were found in spleen and kidney as compared to lower but equal levels between heart and liver  <cit> . while belonging to different families, both prv and pmcv cause necrosis and inflammation in heart muscle. the lower levels of prv in heart may reflect a more persistently infecting nature compared to pmcv  <cit> .

while clinical cms outbreaks typically give 5-20% mortality  <cit> , no fish died in the present challenge trial. this suggested that during natural cms outbreaks, either larger fish , higher numbers of infectious viral particles or possibly additional stressors must be present to give mortality. coherence between distinct stress factors and viral infection resulting in higher mortality has been shown for other diseases in farmed atlantic salmon  <cit> . an interesting observation was the high proportion of fish with no or moderate cardiac lesions at time points when viral loads and histopathological scores were significant. thus, fish obviously exhibited different outcomes of infection. comparison of these groups is currently under investigation. in the present study, fish with strongest pathology and viral infection were selected at each time point, in order to characterise immune responses at the transcriptome level in fish at similar stages of the disease process and with representative cms pathology. fish was challenged by injection to ensure simultaneous infection of all fish and since cohabitation had shown to give slower development of disease and weaker overall pathology . the individual qpcr analysis of six antiviral genes in  <dig> fish  <dig> wpi showed similar levels of upregulation, supporting that all fish had mounted equal antiviral responses following infection and were in similar disease state. this was further supported by a significant increase in viral loads of fish between week  <dig> and  <dig> 

temporal development of immune responses
early antiviral and ifn responses were activated at every time point and across tissues during infection. however, the overall expression profile showed declined mrna levels with time in spite of increased virus replication. this contrasted the strong correlation between expression levels of six selected genes and viral load observed at  <dig> wpi, implying that activation of these genes with increased production of viral rna was predominant at the early stage and possibly related to autocrine effects, such as pathogen recognition and induction of signalling pathways. the subsequent reduction in transcriptional activity might be due to increased paracrine effects of proteins in the induced innate responses, including both effector functions for clearance of virus and recruitment of immune cells for development of humoral and adaptive immunity. the ifn type i responses to different viral diseases have been reported in salmonids, with particular focus on ifn alpha and mx protein  <cit> . we identified a suite of putative ifn-dependent genes with stronger upregulation which have been unknown or scarcely investigated in salmon. most of these genes have shown responses to other viral diseases in salmon  <cit> . strongest induction at  <dig> wpi was found for ifit <dig> and rsad <dig>  also known as viperin. both genes are known to be induced by ifn and involved in defence against viruses  <cit> . little is known about gig1- and gig2-like genes in fish, but they were induced by viral infection in grass carp cells  <cit> . members of this gene family were also strongly induced in rainbow trout  <dig> h post infection with the parasite causing whirling disease  <cit> . four different genes from the tripartite motif  family c-iv were also significantly induced over several time points. one of them, trim <dig>  has been implicated in the rig-i pathway by regulating the capability of rig-i to activate type i ifn  <cit> . several genes belonging to families of ifn-inducible gtpases were also early induced, including two transcript similar to very large inducible gtpase  <dig>  and eight transcripts similar to gtpase imap family member  <dig>  the role of these novel gtpases in vertebrate infection is gaining interest  <cit> .

proteins of the complement system bind and opsonize viral particles, marking them for phagocytosis by apcs. binding to antigen-antibody complexes makes the complement system a bridge between the innate and the adaptive immune system. this is in line with results of the present study, where upregulation of complement genes at  <dig> wpi took place shortly after the first activation of b cell- and mhc antigen presentation genes and the onset of cardiac histopathology. in subsequent time points, activation of the adaptive immune response was most prominent. this distinct sequence of immune events was evidence for a coordinated regulation of responses, and the 'bridging' role of the complement system between the early innate response and the fully activated adaptive response. coincidence with the first occurrence of moderate cardiac lesions , suggests complement genes as candidates disease markers for the early clinical stage of cms.

the immediate activation of antigen presentation as has been observed during early virus infection in salmon  <cit> , was supported by the upregulation of proteasome and mhc class i pathway genes that coincided with the early ifn/antiviral response at  <dig> wpi. this was analogous to the typical development of an adaptive immune response: while ifns are strongest activated and elicit antiviral effects very early after infection, they also have an activating effect on antigen processing and presentation  <cit> . activation of antigen presentation is also the first step in the cellular immune response mediated by b and t lymphocytes. the first peak of b cell activity was detected at  <dig> wpi following the typical pattern of a humoral immune response in teleost fish, usually expected between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks after infection  <cit> . however, the co-regulated b cell- and mhc antigen presentation genes showed a biphasic expression, with a second and even stronger activation at  <dig> and  <dig> wpi when the clinical signs were also peaking. this observation is probably explained by the higher influx of leukocytes and level of inflammatory reactions in heart tissue as supported by histology. interestingly, stronger second peak of induction occurred after the activation of complement genes at  <dig> wpi. this may indicate that a potential humoral response based on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and virus neutralization is complement-dependent. future development of tools for assessment of virus-specific antibody titers may confirm this. most of the representative genes  followed the typical regulatory pattern for b cell and antigen presentation components. for example, the strongest induction of cd <dig> was found at  <dig> and  <dig> wpi, before the strongest t cell activation was detected. it has been shown that cd <dig> is induced downstream of the antigen receptor during t-independent humoral b cell response  <cit> . however, the majority of genes showed highest upregulation in heart at peak pathology and viral load,  <dig> and  <dig> weeks after infection, indicating their role in b cell responses and presentation of viral antigens to effector t cells. one example was cd <dig>  a surface protein of both b and t lymphocytes which is expressed at low levels in inactive cells but rapidly induced after activation  <cit> . thus, it can be used as a marker of general activation of lymphocytes. in this study it was a representative marker gene for the overall expression profile of b/t lymphocyte-related responses.

the co-regulatory pattern of t cell- and apoptosis-related genes correlating with histopathology score was a prominent feature of the immune response in cms hearts. control of cell death by apoptosis is a fundamental process for regulation of the t cell response and for maintaining homeostasis in the immune system after it has expanded to combat infections  <cit> . importantly, dysfunctional control of t cell function and apoptosis is associated with immunopathology  <cit> . thus, the apoptosis-related profile coinciding with the t cell profile in this study may represent novel genes involved in regulation of effector function and controlled cell death of t cells in salmon. of particular interest were several genes encoding tnf-related proteins and programmed cell death ligand  <dig> . the dominance of genes encoding rho gtpases was interesting, since they have been implicated in the regulation of tcr signaling, t cell cytoskeletal reorganization, t cell migration and t cell apoptosis  <cit> . it seemed to be a borderline from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi when expression of t cell/apoptosis pathways was significantly induced, coinciding with the first occurrence of histopathology scores  <dig> and virus ct values below  <dig>  according to this pattern, the first severe inflammation and cytopathic effects caused by the virus  at  <dig> wpi was probably the priming event for a strong influx of lymphocytes to the infected heart tissue. cardiac elevation of mrna levels for cd <dig>  granzyme and ifn gamma at 8- <dig> wpi indicated activity of cytotoxic cd8+ t cells. genes encoding cd <dig> were also induced, but at lower levels. one week after elevation of t cell activity  viral load and histopathology score were decreasing , and the first significant decrease was evident at  <dig> wpi . this indicated that the cellular effector response mediated by t cells, and in particular cd8+ t cells, was contributing to a successful clearance of the virus infection. among other interesting genes in this group, tnf decoy receptor showed the highest correlation versus histopathology score and viral load. however, the function of this receptor in salmon immunity is not known.

tissue regulation of immune responses
the systemic induction of early antiviral and ifn-dependent genes was expected, given the observed replication of pmcv in all tissues and the fact that most of these genes are presumably activated in the presence of viral rna. the stronger induction at early infection  <dig> wpi compared to peak viral load  <dig> wpi was common for all tissues and blood, and has already been discussed. the functional relation between ifns and mhc antigen presentation pathways was supported by their similar expression profiles across tissues and time points. the only exception was the cardiac expression of the latter, which was equally induced between time points . proteasome and mhc components are commonly induced by ifns during viral infection  <cit> . in addition to heart tissue, where pathology developed, these genes were equally induced in spleen and kidney at  <dig> wpi supporting the importance of these tissues for lymphocyte maturation and priming of the immune response  <cit> . the observation that this induction was not in sync with viral load may further suggest that these responses were time-dependent, e.g. related to the stage of disease rather than viral load and pathology. little is known about the expression of complement components in atlantic salmon during viral infections. in common carp and channel catfish, the highest expression of complement was found in the liver  <cit> . in humans, liver is also the main source of complement component c <dig>  but production in macrophages and endothelial cells has also been shown  <cit> . during cms, complement genes were only activated in extrahepatic tissue and more specifically in cardiac tissue, where virus infection was most prominent. interestingly, complement genes were induced in the spleen during clinical phase, suggesting that splenocytes  represent an important source of complement and can play a role in this response in salmonid virus infection. this induction of complement was also independent of viral load, which was equal between  <dig> and  <dig> wpi. in humans, the complement component c <dig> has an important role in regulating the maturation of b cells in the spleen  <cit> . thus, the induction of splenic complement might reflect signalling events between activation of antigen presenting cells such as b cells and possibly production of virus-specific antibodies. however, more research is needed to understand this process. tissue regulation of adaptive immune responses as represented by expression of b cell, t cell and apoptosis gene sets shared some common features. most notable was the opposite regulation of these responses in heart and kidney between the early and clinical stage, which was characterised by an induced expression from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi in heart, and reduced expression from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi in kidney. interestingly, twelve genes  showed no regulation in heart but induced expression in kidney at  <dig> wpi. on the contrary, at  <dig> wpi induction was restricted to heart while no expression changes were found in kidney. this could be evidence for an early clonal expansion and maturation of effector t cells in kidney which then migrated to the heart for elimination of virus-infected cells four weeks later. the adaptive immune responses in kidney was activated at the early stage of infection despite equally high levels of viral rna at both  <dig> and  <dig> wpi, further suggesting a specific role for kidney in the early priming and maturation of cellular immunity.

CONCLUSIONS
we used oligonucleotide microarrays to assess transcriptome changes in atlantic salmon experimentally infected with pmcv, inducing cardiac pathology consistent with cms and transient viraemia. from comparative analysis of gene expression, histology and viral load, the temporal and spatial regulation of immune responses were characterised and novel immune genes identified, ultimately leading to a more complete understanding of host-pathogen responses and pathology and protection in atlantic salmon during cms.
