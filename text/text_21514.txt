BACKGROUND
expression profiling of the genes encoding extracellular enzymes is of high relevance to several industries. commercial enzyme-preparation are often targeted to a specific activity such as cellulase for the degradation of cellulose and preparation of fabrics, or amylases for the preparation of dense syrups from starch or similar compounds. the world market for industrial enzymes is a multi-billion dollar market  <cit> . another emerging market is the production of second generation biofuels. energy-efficient processes rely on enzymes produced by fungi and other degraders of dead biomass  to produce cheap co2-neutral fuels from non-edible plant matter  <cit> . for this study, we have chosen to study the saprobic fungus aspergillus niger, a well studied, efficient, and widely used enzyme producer  <cit> .

the interest in profiling the expression patterns of genes coding for polysaccharide-active enzyme is not new, but few large-scale surveys have been done. an early study was made by one of the authors  <cit>  using northern blotting to create expression profiles of  <dig> pectinolytic genes under  <dig> different growth conditions. the publication of the first a. niger genome  <cit>  provided the prediction of  <dig> polysaccharide-active enzymes, along with microarrays for expression profiling. this has catalyzed more research, specifically the work of martens-uzunova  <cit> , where expression profiles of  <dig> pectinolytic genes are examined. other studies by yuan et al.  <cit> , examined the degradation of the polysaccharide inulin and identified the regulating protein and, in one case, performed expression profiling of genes from three out of the  <dig> carbohydrate-acting enzyme families predicted by pel et al.  <cit>  to be present in a. niger. while studies of this type address interesting parts of the polysaccharide degradation potential, there is a need to evaluate the entire scope of polysaccharides and enzymes, to fully address the challenges involved in complete degradation of plant biomass for biotechnology purposes.

the degradation of plant biomass is a complex procedure requiring a cocktail of enzymes. furthermore, the polysaccharides are rarely found independently in nature. hemicellulose, found in the cell walls of plants, are a complex three-dimensional structure of several types and structures of polysaccharides such as glucomannan, arabinan, and xylan. it has been shown in several studies  <cit> , that the presence of one simple saccharide can trigger the expression of enzymes for the degradation of an entirely different structure . another possibility with industrial applications is the use of a cheap carbon-source to induce the enzymes required for degradation of a more complex and expensive one  <cit> . one example is the work of yuan et al.  <cit> , where sucrose induces the genes for all of the enzymes required for degrading inulin.

with the complex regulation of expression of a large number of different enzymes and the fact that many different enzymes are needed for the utilization of certain carbon sources , it is necessary to apply a systems-wide approach for mapping the regulatory network. the enzyme expression network can be combined and cross-triggered, so being able to examine the entire system at once can shed light on systems that might not be possible to pre-empt with a hypothesis-driven approach.

in this study, we have compiled knowledge on the structure and degradation of  <dig> types of plant polysaccharides from Â¿ <dig> articles. this has been combined with a list of  <dig> genes from a. niger coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes  <cit>  to form a systematic graphical overview.

this makes it possible to highlight directly on the polysaccharide structures e.g. which genes are actively induced on a specific carbon source. this is a network-based approach for interpretation of data, where the network is provided by the structures of the extracellular polysaccharides, in contrast to the intracellular metabolic or regulatory networks often used for data-interpretation.

we apply this reconstructed network to investigate how enzymes interact to degrade complex polysaccharides with applications within sustainable biotechnology. the correlation of gene expression analysis on three monosaccharides and three complex carbohydrates with the network allowed the detection of concerted enzymatic actions as well as cross-induction of enzymatic cocktails.

we also see the combination of the network mapping of available information on the structure of polysaccharides with the transcription analysis as a source of reference for researchers interested in the induction of specific carbohydrate-active genes on certain substrates.

RESULTS
polysaccharide mapping generates a graphical knowledge base on biomass degradation
in a review of the available literature on the degradation of polysaccharides by a. niger, information was compiled on the following  <dig> types of polysaccharides: starch, cellulose, pullulan, inulin, galactomannan, galactoglucomannan , xyloglucan , as well as the following six distinct components of pectin: smooth pectin , xylogalacturonan, arabinogalactan , arabinan, and rhamnogalacturonan i. the last known polysaccharide component of pectin, rhamnogalacturonan ii, was not included even though the structure has been elucidated  <cit> , since no studies of its degradation by a. niger were found in the literature search. analyses of the degradation of this polysaccharide is made more difficult by the fact that it is composed mainly of highly modified and rare sugars and thought to be the most complex polysaccharide on earth  <cit> .

sixteen structures have been gathered in schematic representations of each type of polysaccharide. an example of this  is found in figure  <dig>  schematic representations for all  <dig> structures and information on the genes are found in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

for each of these structures, the available literature and sequence databases  were examined and information was gathered on the enzymes required for their degradation. this was integrated on the schematic representation of the structure as ec numbers where available, or as enzyme-names if the ec number was not available . this was compared to the annotation of a. niger cbs  <dig>  genome sequence  <cit>  to identify putative isoenzymes for each activity. for each structure, this has resulted in a table containing the activities required for degradation, reference to literature on the characterization of the genes and enzymes, as well as information on the specificities where available. the sequence information is found as uniprot accession numbers as well as gene ids in the a. niger cbs  <dig>  and atcc  <dig> sequence. further information was found in an analysis of the carbohydrate degradation genes from a. nidulans <cit> . an example of this is found in table  <dig>  with the full table and tables for all  <dig> structures found in additional file  <dig>  this annotation is a valuable reference on carbohydrate degradation by a. niger. the combination of structures and specifics on required enzymatic activities and genes makes this a significant extension of previous studies, which are dealing with a subset of the structures and generic enzymatic activities  <cit> .

for each isoenzyme, putative or characterized, is noted literature references and the gene id in the sequencings of a. niger cbs  <dig>  and atcc  <dig>  cazy families are shown in the cazy columnn  <cit> , the list of necessary enzymes are gathered from the work described in refs.  <cit> .

for a number of the studies found in the literature search, it was not possible to link the characterized enzymes with a sequence as only molecular mass and/or isoelectric point of the characterized enzyme were given. however, as these characterizations still include valuable information on the enzymatic capabilities of a. niger, in additional file 17: table s <dig> includes an overview of the literature on characterizations of  <dig> enzymatic activities, where the gene could not be determined.

the mapping of these  <dig> structures includes information on  <dig> unique putative and characterized carbohydrate-active genes from the a. niger cbs  <dig>  sequence  <cit> , and  <dig> from the a. niger atcc  <dig> sequence   <cit> . of these, the products of  <dig> of the genes have been previously characterized . in total, the integrated information includes references to  <dig> articles. a full overview of the structures and the integrated genes is available in additional file  <dig> 

this map also includes a section with an overview of all of the  <dig> genes identified to code for putative or known polysaccharide-acting enzymes sorted into gene families. a plotting of expression indices directly on the structures of the map as well as in the overview section makes a systems-wide examination possible as described in the following.

transcriptome analysis
to assess the regulatory network of genes for extracellular enzymes, a. niger was cultivated on six different carbon sources: three mono-saccharides , and three complex polysaccharides with a defined composition of sugars . crude preparations of polysaccharides may include a multitude of undefined sugars and other types of compounds. the use of defined complex polysaccharides in this type of analysis allows for stronger conclusions on which saccharides induce which genes.

the batch cultivations were performed in shake flasks and samples were taken for transcriptome analysis and determination of free sugar concentrations . pairwise statistical comparisons of data from the sets of biological replicates were performed, and the number of statistically significantly  regulated genes in each comparison is shown in table  <dig> 

all values are shown as averageÂ±standard deviation. cells marked with - were not measured.

the first number in the cells is the number of significantly regulated genes in the pairwise comparison of the carbon sources in the top row and left column. the number marked with an âare the genes that are up-regulated on the carbon source in the top row relative to the one in the left column, while the number with an âdenotes the opposite.

in an examination of the sugar-concentration measurements of table  <dig>  it is rather clear that the sugar-profiles at the time of sampling for transcriptome analysis are quite different, thus giving clear difference between the experimental conditions. the only exception is the profiles on the d-glucose and starch media, where the concentrations of free d-glucose are rather similar. this is most likely due to the fact that the strain employed is an amylase-producer, meaning that starch is rapidly be hydrolyzed to d-glucose, thus making the actual difference between the two carbon sources small. this is reflected in the transcriptome comparison of table  <dig>  where it is seen that only  <dig> genes show significant changes in expression between d-glucose and starch. these genes could either be false positives, genes responding to polysaccharides present in the degraded starch medium, or genes responding to the difference in d-glucose concentration between the two conditions . while polysaccharide induction is not unlikely, a. niger is also known to have gradual responses from  <dig>  â  <dig> mm d-glucose  <cit> .

in a closer examination of table  <dig>  it is seen that a larger number of genes are responding to the polysaccharides xylan and arabinan compared to the monosaccharides and starch. this is expected since degradation of the diverse components and types of covalent bonds constituting complex carbon sources must require a larger set of genes than a simple one-sugar monosaccharide substrate. furthermore, as can be seen in table  <dig>  the concentration of free sugars is roughly an order of magnitude lower in the medium containing the complex carbon sources. it has been shown that crea mediates carbon repression of xylanolytic enzymes by d-xylose, beginning at  <dig> mm and increases in strength up to in the area between 30â <dig> mm  <cit> . these ranges are similar to the concentrations in the comparison of d-xylose and xylan in this study. similar effects within the same ranges of concentration are known for arar and xlnr , as well as for amyr . cross-regulation of these carbon-repressing proteins has also been reported  <cit> . the free sugars are seemingly released from the polysaccharides  in a rate that effectively lessens the effects of carbon repression on these media.

the differences in induction were examined by preparing a map of the carbohydrate active enzymes for each pairwise comparison. for each map, the statistically significantly changed gene expressions are shown . this gives maps of the enzymatic activities induced by a specific monosaccharide or the required enzymatic activities for degradation of a specific polysaccharide. a few examples of comparisons that showed results on a systemic level are discussed here:

arabinan versus l-arabinose
the comparison of these two carbon sources  showed a diverse response. regulation was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> carbohydrate-acting gene families predicted to be present in a. niger <cit> . as the mapping shows, the induction on arabinan unsurprisingly includes all of the activities required to degrade arabinan , but also the entire sets of genes required to degrade the pectin components xylogalacturonan, arabinogalactan and rhamnogalacturonan. this is very likely due to the presence of small amounts of rhamnose, galactose, and galacturonic acid in the preparation of arabinan, as described in the materials section. galacturonic acid is known to induce pectinolytic enzymes  <cit> . the induction on arabinan also includes activities directed towards acid-residues not described in the arabinan preparation, e.g. genes putatively acting on glucuronic acid of arabinogalactan, rhamnogalacturonan acetyl esterase , and ferulic acid esterase b  acting on arabinan. these enzymes are reacting to compounds found in arabinan and rhamnogalacturonan i . it is therefore likely that triggering residues are present in minute amounts in the preparation.

arabinose versus d-glucose
despite only  <dig> genes being regulated, a mapping of these genes revealed that  <dig> of them were coding for putative polysaccharide-active gene products  and all of them induced by l-arabinose. interestingly, all three of the induced arabinan-acting genes were exo-acting arabinofuranosidases , including the characterized abfa and abfb <cit> . however, the remaining induced genes constitute all of the activities of the xylan-acting genes , including Î²-galactosidase laca, endo-xylanases, and Î±-galacturonase a , suggesting that l-arabinose alone can induce the entire complex of xylan-degrading enzymes.

starch versus xylan
a comparison of these two carbon sources is especially interesting, as no bond-types are shared between the two. mapping of the significantly regulated genes  indicates just this. the regulated genes are limited to all of the activities required to degrade starch  and the activities required for degradation of xylan . those up-regulated on starch include glucoamylase a , Î±-glucosidase a  as well as one or more of the three genes for Î±-amylase  with almost identical nucleotide-level sequences. it is not possible with an expression analysis to differentiate between them. the genes induced on xylan are the same genes as described to be induced by l-arabinose in the comparison of l-arabinose and d-glucose, with the exception that the endo-xylanase xlnb is induced on xylan instead of the putative endo-xylanase an15g04550/ <dig> that is induced by l-arabinose. we have thus identified a full set of extracellular polysaccharide-acting genes for the degradation of oat spelt xylan and starch and shown that with the exception of xlnb, l-arabinose induces the same array of xylan-degrading enzymes as does xylan .

transcription-based clustering
to further investigate the regulation of single genes and the functions of genes that appear to be co-regulated, a clustering analysis of the expression indices of all  <dig> putative and characterized glucoside hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases and carbohydrate esterases on the six different carbon sources was performed, thus including also genes which could not be assigned directly to a polysaccharide structure. .  <dig> gene clusters were identified. clustering allows the identification of genes that are only induced by the complex substrates, as well as genes that are induced equally well by a particular monosaccharide as well as the complex polysaccharide.

the transcription profile of each cluster  was examined and classified in terms of regulation on the different carbon sources . if a distinct regulation was evident from the clustering profile, this information was added to the table as well, making this an overview of regulation and possible polysaccharide specificity for each of the  <dig> genes in the survey. the same study was made for the subset of genes coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes that were significantly regulated in one or more pairwise comparisons . this subset consists of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes, and  <dig> of the  <dig> characterized genes. however, as can be seen in additional file  <dig>  the clustering of the subset is very similar to those of the full set of genes . a comparison of the clusters of the two studies are also present in additional file 17: table s <dig>  since the majority of the genes were significantly regulated, and the remainder fall mostly in the same clusters, the following detailed analysis of the clustering was made using the full set, thereby giving information on the expression patterns of as many genes as possible.

as it is evident from figure  <dig>  clusters 21â <dig> are highly similar. in making the clusters, it was attempted to use fewer clusters, and thereby combine these four clusters, however this combination required a decrease of the total numbers of clusters to  <dig>  which increased the variation in the other clusters dramatically . for this reason, it was concluded that they have distinct patterns, as the small standard deviations of the clusters also suggest, and they have been kept as separate clusters. furthermore, as clusters 21â <dig> are almost solely induced on arabinan, one would need to include more pectin-like substrates, e.g. polygalacturonic acid, in the analysis to be able to differentiate between the regulation of these genes. however, what one can conclude from this is that the genes of cluster  <dig> are specific for arabinan, and are not induced by any of the other saccharides in this study. it is interesting that axha clusters with this group, as it was previously shown to be induced on birchwood xylan but not on d-xylose  <cit> . however, no induction on xylan is seen for cluster  <dig>  suggesting that this gene is not induced by oat spelt xylan in this strain.

in examining the clusters for general trends, it was found that for most of the clusters, regulation on d-glucose and starch are very similar. this is in good agreement with the high level of free d-glucose in both cultures shown in table  <dig>  exceptions are clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which should be interesting for determining genes that are sensitive to degradation-products of starch, but not necessarily statistically significant in the comparison of starch versus d-glucose .

for each cluster, a map marking the genes of that cluster was prepared and examined to determine an activity profile if possible .

several of the clusters are targeted to a specific type of polysaccharide. one example hereof is cluster  <dig>  while it does not containing any characterized genes, the genes of the cluster are quite specifically predicted to code for enzymes with activity towards galactomannan and insoluble galactoglucomannan . this homogeneity of functions confirms the putative annotations. as the cluster is up-regulated on the mono-sugars and the relatively easily degradable potato starch, it is likely that this cluster contains genes are induced by mono-sugar-abundance and code for a set of âscouting enzymesâ with the role to liberate more substrates.

cluster  <dig> has the highest level of expression on d-glucose and starch carbon sources. an examination of it with the enzyme mapping , reveals that it constitutes a full set of co-regulated starch-degrading enzymes. the individual genes found in the cluster encode solely amylases and glucosidases, including glucoamylase a  and one or more of the three Î±-amylases with similar sequences discussed above . the starch part of the map can be found in figure  <dig>  the fact that these enzymes cluster together can be seen as a validation of the transcription analysis and the clustering employed.

rather interesting is the observation that the hemicellulose component arabinan seems to induce enzymes acting on cellulose and other Î²-glucans . this is seen in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  each containing one of the characterized cellobiohydrolases  and several putative Î²-glucosidases. Î²-glucans are not found as components of pectins, which makes this pattern a genuine induction across carbon-sources of entirely different chemical make-up.

as discussed above, the profile of cluster  <dig> indicates that it mainly contains genes that can be described as pectinolytic. a map inspection  confirms that these genes have a very distinct profile including all enzymatic activities for the degradation of rhamnogalacturonan i, smooth pectin, and xylogalacturonan, all components of pectin, as are arabinan.

comparison of transcriptional regulation to previous studies
as described in the introduction, relatively few large-scale studies exist where the carbon source-based induction of extracellular enzymes have been studied. there is little overlap in the carbon sources employed in this study. studies of polysaccharides have mainly been done with di-saccharides such as maltose or sucrose  <cit>  or on commercial preparations of pectin for food gelling  <cit> . however, a few have been made, which will be compared to the results of the present study here. a relatively larger number of studies including single or a few genes are published, however, these have been cited in the text above where appropriate, and in additional file  <dig> 

the method applied here is comparable to a study of one of the authors, where a principal component analysis  allows clustering according to expression profiles  <cit> . while that study focuses mainly on pectinolysis, it includes studies of growth on d-glucose, d-xylose, and l-arabinose. the study describes abfaabfb, and laca as being co-regulated and induced by  <dig> mm l-arabinose, which is in good accordance with the results of this work, as all of these are found in cluster  <dig>  interestingly however, that work also reports abna as being induced by l-arabinose and co-regulated with abfab and laca, but in the present work, only induction on arabinan is seen , and with a statistically significant up-regulation on arabinan in all pairwise comparisons. this may be due to our higher concentration of l-arabinose  leading to differences in carbon-repression. the pca also indicates a close relationship between pmeapgax, and abna, which describes accurately the patterns of cluster  <dig> 

faea and faeb are known to be largely co-regulated, but faea is induced on d-xylose due to an induction by the xylanolytic regulator xlnr  <cit> . faea and faeb are separated in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  that are very similar, but cluster  <dig> responds to d-xylose, whereas cluster  <dig> responds to the ferulic acid-containing arabinan, suggesting that faeb is more targeted to arabinan.

another study  <cit>  examines induction of genes on d-xylose and maltose, which has an Î±- <dig> -glucoside bond similar to starch. in figure two in ref.  <cit> , eleven genes can be seen to be induced by maltose and/or d-xylose . all of these are regulated in a similar fashion in the present work, if maltose  is seen to be similar to starch n).

CONCLUSIONS
enzyme preparations have multiple areas of application and are a billion dollar market with a low cost/profit ratio. thus, it is of great importance and interest to gain an understanding of the processes leading to production of enzymes with a specific profile.

in this study, the first genome-scale characterization of all genes coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes identified in a. niger is provided. based on a review of more than  <dig> articles and sequence database searches, information of  <dig> genes and enzymes has been systematized according to the polysaccharide structures they degrade, thereby providing an updated reference on extracellular enzyme-expression in a. niger. this data-integration effort has produced schematic representations  of  <dig> types of polysaccharide-structures specifically updated with the a. niger enzymatic machinery.

an application of this knowledge was performed in a transcription study where statistical analysis as well as expression-level-based clustering and mapping were employed to provide transcription profiles of  <dig> genes on six defined carbon sources, thereby adding considerably to our knowledge of the transcription-level regulation of these genes. new knowledge was generated on the carbon source-based transcriptional regulation of previously characterized genes including, but not limited to, abfa, abfb, agla, cbha, cbhb, glaa, egla, eglb, faea, faeb, laca, pela, pelb, pelc, xlnb, and xyna as well as more than  <dig> uncharacterized genes predicted to code for carbohydrate-active enzymes. the mapping of transcribed genes allowed us to identify induction by mono-saccharides of complete sets of enzymes for degradation of complex substrates, as well as the induction of cellulolytic enzymes on a hemicellulose substrate, e.g. xylan.
