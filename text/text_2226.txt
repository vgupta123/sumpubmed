BACKGROUND
cucumber  is one of the most important vegetable crops cultivated worldwide, immature fruits of which are consumed cooked, processed, or fresh in a considerable amount. agricultural production of cucumbers and gherkins accounted for more than  <dig> million hectares of land yielding  <dig> million tons of produce in  <dig> . however, cucumber has a very narrow genetic base and lack of molecular polymorphism , which impedes the construction of saturated genetic maps and map-based cloning of horticultural important genes. in the past decades, cucumber linkage maps were mostly composed of dominant markers , and did not reach saturated  due to insufficient marker number .

draft genome assemblies of three cucumber lines   successively published provide a good opportunity for developing simple sequence repeats  as co-dominant markers in map construction  <cit> . several ssr-based maps have been developed with 100 ~  <dig> or even more markers , and genes controlling cucumber scab resistant , compact growth , zucchini yellow mosaic virus resistance  , uniform immature fruit color , tuberculate fruit , spine color and mature fruit color , and dull skin  were mapped or fine mapped . the inter-subspecific genetic map with  <dig> ssrs constructed by ren et al.
 <cit>  is the most saturated, followed by an intra-varietal map containing  <dig> loci  <cit> . unfortunately, over one quarter of the mapped ssrs in this inter-subspecific map were found clustering in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> due to the small mapping population  and possible chromosomal rearrangements between the two parents . two consensus maps were developed in cucumber to increase marker density, which were constructed by zhang et al.   <cit> , and yang et al. , respectively  <cit> . both of them employed the gy14 × pi  <dig> map with  <dig> ssrs for map integration  <cit> , whereas marker orders in recombination suppression regions in the 1369-point map were not well placed. the 1681-locus consensus map overcame this drawback by the integrating intra-varietal map by yang et al.
 <cit> , and improved marker orders and density in three chromosomes particularly in chromosome  <dig>  despite the high marker density in consensus maps, it is still difficult to construct saturated maps for f <dig> or ril populations derived from intra-varietal crosses to conduct qtl analysis and molecular mapping in certain populations.

single-nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most abundant and stabile form of genetic variation in most genomes, which have become the marker type of choice in many evolutionary and ecological studies . the advent of massive parallel next-generation sequencing  technologies has made it possible for high-throughput identification and genotyping of snps. however, whole-genome deep re-sequencing is still cost-prohibitive for sequencing and genotyping large populations and usually not necessary  <cit> . reduced representation library  sequencing is one strategy to bring down the cost through genome reduction  <cit> . restriction-site associated dna sequencing  reduces genome complexity by sequencing only the dna fragments with restriction sites in spite of length, and has been proven to be a useful tool for snp discovery and genetic mapping . 2b-rad is a streamlined rad approach that sequences uniform fragments generated by type iib restriction endonuclease, which is suitable for species with large genomes including humans  <cit> . recently, specific-length amplified fragments sequencing  was developed as a modified rrl sequencing strategy for de novo snp discovery and genotyping of large populations  <cit> , which has generated high-density genetic maps with abundant snps for common carp, sesame and soybean .

studies have shown that a number of fruit-related traits are controlled by quantitative trait loci  in cucumber, such as fruit weight and fruit shape index  . fruit length and weight are two traits that significantly correlate with yield and commercial quality of the cultivated cucumber. with a srap -based genetic map , yuan et al.
 <cit>  identified five qtls for fruit weight and seven qtls for fruit length. more recently, cheng et al.
 <cit>  identified five qtls for immature fruit length using  <dig> ssrs on lgs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  miao et al.
 <cit>  detected three qtls for immature fruit length on lg <dig> and lg <dig> with a previously constructed map . five qtls conditioning fruit weight were also identified on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  <cit> . however, the information is still insufficient for map-based gene cloning for cucumber yield and fruit quality improvement.

in this study, a high-throughput and cost-effective slaf-seq approach was employed to generate an snp-based genetic map for cucumber, which contained  <dig>  high quality snps and spanned  <dig>  cm with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. physically, we anchored  <dig> of the ‘9930’ draft genome scaffolds with  <dig>  mb sequences. two mis-assembled scaffolds were verified. nine qtls controlling fruit length and weight were detected on four linkage groups.

RESULTS
high-throughput slaf sequencing and genotyping
a total of  <dig>  gb raw data was generated from illumina sequencing and slaf library construction, which contained  <dig> , <dig> pair-end reads with a length of 100 bp. the gc  content was  <dig> %, and q <dig> ratio  was  <dig> %. in the paternal inbred line ,  <dig> , <dig> reads and  <dig>  slafs were generated, with an average coverage of  <dig> -fold for each slaf. in the maternal line , the number of reads produced for  <dig>  slafs was  <dig> , <dig>  and the average cover for each slaf marker was  <dig> -fold. for the analysis of the f <dig> mapping population,  <dig>  to  <dig>  reads were generated for the development of  <dig>  to  <dig>  slaf markers for each plant; the marker coverage ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold, with an average of  <dig> -fold . the average count of slafs per individual was  <dig>  .figure  <dig>

after correcting or discarding low-depth slaf tags,  <dig>  high-quality slafs were identified, among which  <dig>  were polymorphic with a polymorphism rate of  <dig> % . the parental lines were given with different alphabets as genotypes to determine segregation patterns, and  <dig>  from the  <dig>  polymorphic slafs were successfully encoded and grouped into eight segregation patterns  following a genotype encoding rule . since the two parents  are homozygous cucumber inbred lines with genotypes of aa and bb, only the  <dig>  markers that fell into the aa × bb segregation pattern were used in linkage analysis .table  <dig>

genetic linkage map
after removing incomplete and significant segregation distortion markers,  <dig>  snps were retained for genetic map construction. joinmap  <dig>  assigned all the  <dig>  markers to seven lgs of cucumber . the average integrity of the mapped snp markers reached  <dig> %, representing a relatively high map quality. details of this snp-based cucumber map are presented in additional file  <dig> and summarized in table  <dig> table  <dig> 
summary of the snp-based cucumber genetic map




the total genetic length of the snp map was  <dig>  cm in seven linkage groups with a mean marker distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. the largest linkage group  contained  <dig> snps, while the smallest lg <dig> had  <dig> snps. on average, there were  <dig> snp markers in each linkage group. the genetic distances of seven linkage groups spanned  <dig>  cm  ~  <dig>  cm , with mean marker intervals ranged from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm. ‘gap < = 5′ value, which reflected linkage degree among markers, were  <dig> % on all linkage groups except for lg <dig> .

validation of the snp-based genetic map
the quality of this genetic map was evaluated by heat maps which directly reflected recombination relationships among markers in seven linkage groups . each cell represented a recombination rate between two adjacent markers, the level of which was visualized by different colors ranging from yellow to purple . heat maps indicated snp markers in most lgs were well ordered.

all the mapped snps were used to anchor and orient scaffolds of ‘9930’ draft genome assemblies. physically,  <dig> scaffolds were anchored onto the snp map covering  <dig> %  of the ‘9930’ draft genome sequences . only  <dig> of the  <dig>  snp markers did not have blast hits. locations of all mapped loci on the snp linkage map in the‘9930’ draft genome assembly version  <dig>  are provided in additional file  <dig>  for most scaffolds, more than one snp was assigned to the same scaffold . in several cases, the order of scaffolds oriented by the genetic map disagreed with that in the draft genome assembly. for example, we anchored scaffold000063_ <dig> and scaffold000063_ <dig> to the distal end and one third region of chromosome  <dig> respectively, whereas their positions in the genome assemblies were ~ 3 mb and ~  <dig>  mb, respectively. we thereby designed two single-copy gene probes   to verify their positions by fluorescence in situ hybridization . fish images showed that scaffold000063_ <dig> was at the distal end on chromosome  <dig> and scaffold000063_ <dig> were in a one third region  on the same chromosome. thus these two scaffolds were mis-assembled .figure  <dig>

qtl mapping for fruit length and weight
phenotypic data  in both f <dig> and f2: <dig> families are presented in additional file  <dig>  nine qtls were detected for fruit length  and fruit weight  . immature fruit length had four qtls, and the most prominent qtl designated fl <dig> , accounted for  <dig> % of the observed phenotypic variance . twelve snps covered this interval . a qtl designated fl <dig>  explained  <dig> % of phenotypic variance and was also located on lg <dig>  the effects of other qtls  were comparatively smaller.table  <dig>

three qtls were detected for mature fruit length, with the largest effect displayed by mfl <dig> , explaining  <dig> % of the observed phenotypic variance . sixty-six snps were discovered within the chromosomal region of mfl <dig> . mfl <dig>   and mfl <dig> , two qtls for mature fruit length, were detected on lg <dig> with maximum lod scores of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. notably, mfl <dig>  and fl <dig>  shared the same start marker , as well as a physical length of 5 cm in the mapped region.

two qtls for immature fruit weight  were detected, which both explained  <dig> % of the observed fruit weight variance at maximum . qtl fw <dig>  spanned an interval between  <dig>  ~  <dig>  cm, where eleven snps were identified; the closest marker linked with fw <dig>  was marker <dig>  the other qtl, fw <dig> , was flanked by marker <dig> and marker <dig>  and twelve snps covered this chromosomal region.

discussion
a cost-efficient method of rapid snp discovery and genotyping using slaf-seq
ngs-based marker discovery and genotyping technologies provide a good opportunity for developing snp markers, which are being applied to many studies . whole-genome deep re-sequencing and low coverage sequencing is very costly for large populations and usually unnecessary for linkage mapping and quantitative trait locus mapping. reduced-representation sequencing offers an approach to sample and sequence a small set of genome regions instead of the whole genome  <cit> . rad-seq sequences short dna fragments with restriction sites that are digested by restriction endonuclease despite the length of those fragments. it has been applied for snp discovery and linkage map construction in organisms such as stickleback, rainbow trout, barley, and ryegrass . 2b-rad is a streamlined rad approach that uses type iib restriction endonuclease to produce uniform fragments sequenced through ngs platforms  <cit> . it can screen almost every restriction site in the genome and is simpler than existing rad protocols. however, one drawback of 2b-rad is the read length  constrained by type iib activity. slaf-seq is a recently developed enhanced rrl sequencing strategy for de novo snp discovery and genotyping of large populations  <cit> . like 2b-rad, slaf-seq can also adjust marker identification and genotyping to meet personalized research purposes. the read length in slaf-seq ranges between 30 ~ 50 bp, which may provide efficient locus discrimination as compared to that in 2b-rad . slaf-seq was used to construct saturated snp-based genetic maps in sesame , soybean , and develop 7e chromosome-specific molecular markers for thinopyrume longatum  <cit> . in this study, we generated  <dig>  gb raw data,  <dig> , <dig> pair-end reads, developed  <dig>  slafs through high-throughput slaf sequencing.  <dig>  polymorphic snps were identified for linkage map construction.

the saturated snp-based genetic linkage map in cucumber
in the present study, we report an snp-based genetic linkage map in cucumber using slaf sequencing technology. due to the narrow genetic base in cucumber, it has been difficult to construct high-density genetic maps from intra-varietal crosses to facilitate genetic mapping and qtl analysis of important traits . to date, the most saturated intra-varietal map is constructed by yang et al. with  <dig> ssrs and a mean marker interval of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . the snp map developed herein contained  <dig>  snps and a majority of them were anchored to ‘9930’ draft genome scaffolds . as compared with the 735-ssr map  <cit> , the number of mapped loci, marker density , and total map length  is significantly improved in the snp genetic map. the marker number in this individual map is also an increase in comparison with the two consensus maps by zhang et al.
 <cit>  and yang et al.
 <cit> . we anchored  <dig> scaffolds of ‘9930’ genome scaffolds covering  <dig>  mb of the cucumber genome, which is exceptionally not an increase contrasted to the 735-point , and two integrated maps . this suggests more snp markers are required to anchor scaffolds and cover the entire physical distance of cucumber genome. marker locations on the genetic map and in the scaffolds could infer the quality of both the genetic map and the ‘9930’genome scaffolds. it was demonstrated in several studies that there are mis-assembled scaffolds in the published cucumber draft assemblies  <cit> . in our study, two mis-assembled scaffolds in chromosome  <dig> were verified by single-copy gene fish experiment. this indicated that the snp-based genetic map constructed herein could be applied to detect mis-assembled scaffolds. however, further efforts are needed to address all the scaffold positions as well as improve quality of the snp map.

qtl analysis of fruit-related traits
this study is the first attempt to conduct qtl analysis using a ngs-derived genetic map in cucumber. fruit weight and length are two traits that have direct impacts on field yield of cucumber, thus are important for cultivar improvements. we identified  <dig> qtls for fruit weight and length of mature and immature fruits on three linkage groups. three qtls were detected on lg1; one was on lg <dig>  and five on lg <dig> for fruit yield traits. two pairs of qtls for mature fruit length and immature fruit length shared similar location intervals, fl <dig>  and mfl <dig> , fl <dig>  and mfl <dig> . qtls located in two adjacent marker intervals might take function as one locus. in the previous studies, qtls controlling fruit length were detected on all of the seven chromosomes/linkage groups using f <dig> or ril populations based on different types of markers . for example, cheng et al.
 <cit>  and miao et al.
 <cit>  identified five qtls  and three qtls  that explained  <dig> % ~  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation. among  <dig> qtl s detected by yuan et al.
 <cit> , the qtl on lg <dig> explained  <dig> % of the fruit length variance, which was a dominant qtl. both of the two predominant qtls on lg <dig> in the present study explained ~ 40% of the observed variance. we identified two qtls for immature fruit weight on lg <dig>  which shared one linkage group with the report by yuan et al.
 <cit> , whereas no common lgs with the results from chen et al.
 <cit> . the differences in qtl number, position and phenotypic variance explained might be attributed to different mapping populations  and environment effects  <cit> .

generally, the detected qtl regions in most studies were covered by two markers. nevertheless the chromosomal interval for qtls detected in the present study could cover up to  <dig> snps. for example, the chromosomal region accounted for fl <dig>  on lg <dig>  covered  <dig> snps . this increase in mapped markers is likely to facilitate fine mapping of these qtls in further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we generated  <dig>  gb raw data,  <dig> , <dig> pair-end reads and  <dig>  high-quality slafs using slaf sequencing. a high-resolution genetic map for cucumber was constructed containing  <dig>  snps with a total genetic length of  <dig>  cm. the mean distance between adjacent markers was  <dig>  cm. this snp-based genetic map could be applied to anchor and orient draft genome scaffolds. physically,  <dig> scaffolds from the ‘9930’ draft genome assemblies were anchored. although number of anchored scaffolds was not really an increase compared to existing cucumber consensus maps, the snp map derived from de novo sequencing of a reduced representation genome could still be used to evaluate the quality of draft scaffold assemblies. two mis-assembled scaffold were verified by fish with newly developed single-copy genes. we further applied this linkage map to detect qtls controlling fruit-related traits. nine qtls were identified for fruit length and weight. to date, this study is the first report of large-scale snp identification and genotyping in cucumber. the  <dig> -snp map constructed herein would likely facilitate fine genetic mapping of fruit-related qtls and orientation of draft genome scaffolds.
