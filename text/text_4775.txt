BACKGROUND
plant roots are confronted with the colonization of symbiotic fungal species ranging from pathogens to mutualists  <cit> . while research has largely been focused on the symbiotic and pathogenic interactions, seemingly neutral associations with plant roots by endophytes received less attention  <cit> . endophytic fungi colonize functional roots tissues but disease symptoms do not develop at all or at least not for prolonged periods of time  <cit> . despite their prevalence in many ecosystems, little is known about the nature of interaction with their hosts  <cit> . it is assumed that they behave along the mutualism - antagonism continuum depending on host conditions and environment, as shown for some mycorrhizal fungi .

species belonging to the helotialean phialocephala fortinii s.l. – acephala applanata species complex  are the dominant root endophytes in woody plant species  <cit> . pac shows a global distribution as pac species colonize roots from arctic to subtropical plant species throughout the northern hemisphere . recently, a study proved the presence of pac on the southern hemisphere  <cit> . in contrast to ectomycorrhizal species , which are usually confined to primary, non-lignified roots, pac can be found in all parts of the root system, predominatly on fine roots <  <dig> mm where up to 80% of randomly sampled roots were colonized  <cit> . in addition, pac species are belonging to the first colonizers of tree seedlings in natural forest ecosystems, infecting them within a few weeks after germination  <cit> .

pac is composed of more than  <dig> cryptic species  <cit> , eight of which were formally described  <cit> . among the strains sampled from a single study site, pac species form communities of up to  <dig> sympatrically occurring species. in contrast to agricultural ecosystems, pac communities remain stable for several years  <cit>  although minor long-term changes in the frequency of species can be observed  <cit> . most pac communities are dominated by few species and additional species occur at low frequencies  <cit>  as observed in many other community structures of biological systems  <cit> . species diversity and community structure do not correlate with the tree community, geographical location, soil properties, management practices nor does climate, precipitation and temperature  <cit> . host specificity of pac species was not observed  <cit>  except for a. applanata that was almost exclusively isolated from species belonging to the pinaceae but rarely from ericaceous roots of the ground vegetation  <cit> .

despite the fact that pac species are highly successful colonizers of plant roots and widely distributed in natural ecosystems, their ecological role is still poorly understood. they were described as beneficial, neutral or pathogenic for different hosts, growing conditions and fungal strains  <cit> . new results comparing the effect of pac species and strains on picea abies indicate that the outcome of the interactions is mainly driven by the fungal genotype and follow the antagonism-mutualism continuum. whereas some of the pac/p. subalpina strains were shown to be pathogenic and killed most of the seedlings, others were benign  <cit> . nevertheless, infection by pac is costly for the plant since an increase in plant growth was never observed  <cit> . the outcome of pac-host interactions depends on the ability of pac strains to invade and colonize host root tissues. this is evident by the health status of norway spruce seedlings, which negatively correlates with the biomass of the fungus in roots  <cit> . however, negative effects of harmful pac strains are reduced by the co-colonization of ectomycorrhizal fungi and other pac strains  <cit> .

the dynamics of pac-host colonization was rarely studied , and data on intraspecific variation of colonization dynamics for different pac species is missing completely. in general, pac strains form hyphopodia- or appressoria-like structures to enter root hairs or epidermal cells . after entering the root, pac strains grow inter- and intracellularly and colonize the cortex but rarely invade the vascular cylinder . intercellular labyrinthine fungal tissue resembling the hartig net in ectomycorrhizal fungi as well as mantel-like structures were occasionally observed for pac .fig.  <dig> key features of the colonization of roots by pac species. key steps in the colonization of roots by pac species . figure 1a, b. surface colonization and appressoria/hyphopodia formation of p. subalpina on cistus incanus roots. figure 1c. cross-section of pinus strobus root colonized by pac stained using borax, methylene blue and toluidine blue and counterstained with basic fuchsine. the fungus completely colonizes the cortical tissue up to the endodermis. accumulation of phenolic compounds in the vascular cylinder is evident by the presence of dark granular structures. figure 1d. example of intracellular colonization of p. subalpina in c. incanus cortex 




host defense reactions such as cell-wall appositions or lignituber formation were rarely observed  <cit> . intracellular hyphae traverse host cells by narrow penetration hyphae without apparent lysis of the plant cell wall while the host cell cytoplasma disintegrates after colonization by pac hyphae . pertaining to the ultrastructural level, hyphae are not surrounded by host-derived perifungal membranes, which are regarded as hallmark for biotrophic fungal associations  <cit> . finally, cortical cells of the plant are often associated with thick-walled, heavily melanized fungal cells, i.e. microsclerotia, which were shown to accumulate reserve substances  <cit> .

the availability of genomic sequences provides information on the gene inventory of species and identifies characteristic genomic structures and gene sets associated with different lifestyles . although the number of sequenced fungal genomes increases rapidly, genome sequencing of ascomycetes was mostly restricted to pathogenic, saprophytic or well-known mutualistic species. in contrast, only few endophytes were sequenced and restricted to endophytes in the clavicipitaceae  <cit> . clavicipitalean endophytes are obligate biotrophs, colonize their hosts systemically and follow a very close symbiotic lifestyle with their hosts but roots are not colonized  <cit> . this sets them apart from non-clavicipitalean endophytes isolated from all parts of the plants at high frequencies. an exception is the genome of phialocephala scopiformis, a foliar endophyte, for which the draft genome was recently published albeit with no analysis  <cit> . in the present study, the genome of p. subalpina, the most frequent species of the pac, was sequenced and compared to the genomes of  <dig> ascomycetous species with different lifestyles to get first insights in the genome structure and gene inventory of non-clavicipitalean endophyte.

RESULTS
phialocephala subalpina holds a large and feature-rich genome
the genome of p. subalpina strain uamh  <dig> was sequenced at  <dig> x coverage using the roche/ <dig> gs flx technology. sequence data was assembled into  <dig> scaffolds  with a genome size of  <dig>  mb and an average gc content of  <dig> % . the complete rrna repeat  and the mtdna   <cit>  were assembled manually and validated by sanger sequencing. data sets are accessible at http://pedant.helmholtz-muenchen.de/genomes.jsp?category=fungal. the genome and annotation data was submitted to the european nucleotide archive . mapping of reads data against the assembled genome did not reveal any significant deviations from the average 25x coverage except for the mtdna  and rdna repeat  indicating that no repetitive sequences were collapsed in short scaffolds leading to an underestimation of the genome size.table  <dig> genome statistics for phialocephala subalpina

the annotation pipeline and manual validation resulted in  <dig>  gene models. in addition,  <dig> trna genes coding for all amino acids and  <dig> 5s rrna loci were identified. none of the expected single-copy core orthologous genes found in eukaryotes  was missing in the protein predications for p. subalpina indicating that the core gene inventory had completely been covered. this was supported by est data as  <dig>  out of  <dig>  assembled transcripts  mapped to the assembly with high coverage .  <dig> % of the  <dig>  proteins showed an identity >30% with known proteins in the similarity matrix of proteins database   <cit> . the remaining  <dig>  proteins with less than 30% identity included  <dig>  species-specific p. subalpina proteins. no significant length difference was observed among the high identity and the low identity genes . moreover, mapping of the  <dig>  proteins against the  <dig> est dataset and rna-seq data showed that  <dig>  of these gene models were covered by ≥50% of the orf length with est/rna-seq data . a classification scheme of the gene models based on different analysis is given in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> classification of gene models of p. subalpina. venn diagram showing a classification of gene models based on four different characteristics. putative orthologous gene models were determined by quartets analysis including  <dig> ascomycetous species , putative paralogous gene models in p. subalpina were analyzed using the uclust algorithm, low identity gene models showing <30% identity in simap searches and gene models including ≥ <dig> interpro accessions. five hundred eighty four single-copy and high-identity genes not including interpro accessions were not covered by one of the four characteristics




classification of repetitive elements
repeats that could be classified as transposable elements  accounted for  <dig> % of the genome sequence . in contrast,  <dig> % of repeats identified in repatscout analysis could not be classified to any te family. te were dominated by class i elements of the copia and gypsy families attributing for 55% of all tes. in contrast, class ii tes were less abundant and were dominated by tc <dig> mariner and helitron elements. a large fraction of the repeat consensus sequences of the repeatscout analysis could not be assigned to any te family. tes of all classes/families were evenly scattered throughout the genome of p. subalpina and no evidence for te-rich islands was observed . besides the tes, the genome of p. subalpina also included low-complexity sequences, tandem as well as simple sequence repeats .table  <dig> classification and frequency of the most important transposable elements in the genome of p. subalpina

presence of rnai pathway and evidence for rip mechanisms
homologs of dicer, argonaut and rna-dependent rna polymerase genes were found in multiple copies in the genome of p. subalpina and comparison with other ascomycetes showed that the copy number of each of the three genes was higher than with other ascomycetes . similarly, several copies of cytosine methyltransferase gene of the dnmt <dig> family were present in the genome of p. subalpina . the cytosine methyltransferases encoded in p. subalpina were classified both based on the presence of interpro domains and arrangements of the domains in comparison with neurospora crassa, ascobolus immersus, sclerotinia sclerotiorum and botrytis cinerea homologues. whereas gene models pac_ <dig> and pac_ <dig> included only the c- <dig> cytosine methyltransferase domain  and showed homologies with the rid gene of n. crassa, the other two genes  encoded the c- <dig> cytosine methyltransferase domain as well as bah domains . gene pac_ <dig> has a high similarity with n. crassa dim <dig> whereas gene pac_ <dig> has a high similarity with masc <dig> of a. immersus.table  <dig> presence of rnai and rip core proteins in different fungal genomes

a clear difference in the dinucleotide frequencies was observed in repeat versus genomic control regions and the difference in dinucleotide frequencies was more pronounced in p. subalpina than in s. sclerotiorum . tpa dinucleotides were significantly overrepresented in repeats whereas cpa/tpg were underrepresented suggesting a dominant mode of rip for cpa to tpa mutations. in addition, repeat regions were generally rich in at content as also apa, apt and tdt were more frequent in repeats than in non-repeat genomic regions .fig.  <dig> change in dinucleotide frequencies in repeat regions. change in the dinucleotide frequencies observed in the repeat regions of p. subalpina  and s. sclerotiorum  compared to genomic control regions




the genome indicates horizontal gene transfer  events from bacteria co-occurring in the same habitat
twenty one out of  <dig> genes, originally with a non-fungal best simap hit, showed a skewed taxonomic distribution or higher bit scores with non-fungal taxa in blast searches against the ncbi non-redundant protein  database . phylogenetic analysis for these  <dig> genes showed that they likely result of hgt as the gene trees significantly deviate from the expected species tree . in contrast, the rpb <dig> gene which was used as a control in the analysis, showed the expected ascomycetous phylogeny . in the majority of hgts, the protein sequences taken from the phylogenetically closest non-fungal species were derived from soil-borne bacteria  or to live in the rhizosphere  and share therefore the same habitat as p. subalpina. in  <dig> of the phylogenies, one or few of the closest relatives were of fungal origin while most of the remaining species were of prokaryotic origin. in several cases, p. subalpina clusters together with o. maius and/or p. scopiformis .table  <dig> genes of p. subalpina likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer from non-fungal species

key secondary metabolite genes

among the eight genes for non-reducing type i pkss, two gene clusters were identified in p. subalpina probably involved in the melanin synthesis pathway. whereas pac_ <dig> was placed in the same quartets cluster as g. lozoyensis pks <dig>  pac_ <dig> showed the highest similarity with the gene of a. alternata encoding alm and the gene of a. fumigatus encoding alb1/pksp. in addition, pac_ <dig> was placed in a second quartets cluster. adjacent to both pks genes, a putative hydroxynaphthalene reductase gene was found . however, the two putative scytalone dehydratases  in the p. subalpina genome were not located within either cluster. presence of putative orthologous genes for the two pks for the  <dig> ascomycetous species included in the comparative analysis  showed that only melanized species were included in these two clusters. further, genes of other leotiomycete species, such as s. sclerotiorum, b. cinerea and m. brunnea, were represented in both clusters as p. subalpina. two nrps genes were identified that are likely encoding siderophore synthetases . besides key enzymes in secondary metabolism, the genome of p. subalpina also encodes a fucose-specific lectin  with similarities to the aal protein of aleuria aurantia that was shown to protect the fungus against predators and parasites  <cit> .table  <dig> species included in the comparative genomic analysis

comparative genome analysis proves different lifestyles and enlarged gene families in p. subalpina
to explore the unexpectedly large gene set, the proteome was compared to  <dig> ascomycetous proteomes  using orthologous cluster analysis, interpro motif occurrence and a review of carbohydrate-active enzymes . a total of  <dig>  predicted proteins were grouped into  <dig>  clusters of corresponding putative orthologous genes. proteins of p. subalpina were present in  <dig>  clusters , significantly more than for any other investigated species.  <dig>  clusters included proteins of all  <dig> species and p. subalpina covering core functions in the primary metabolism, energy supply and cell cycle.  <dig> quartets clusters were mostly restricted to pathogens, whereas  <dig> clusters were predominantly found in saprophytic species. principal component analysis based on these two datasets showed that p. subalpina was either placed within the pathogens or close to the saprophytes . moreover, p. subalpina also shared the highest number of quartets clusters with the two mycorrhizal species . the most frequent funcat annotations for the pathogen- and saprophyte-related clusters showed that the secondary and c-metabolism was most often included but also several putative orthologous proteins classified as virulence and disease factors were recognized .fig.  <dig> characterization of p. clusters enriched for pathogens or saprophytes. principle component analysis  based on the presence/absence of species in putative orthologous gene clusters derived from quartets analysis. figure 6a. pca analysis based on  <dig> gene clusters enriched for saprophytic species. figure 6b. pca analysis based on  <dig> clusters enriched in pathogens. figure 6c. venn diagram showing the distribution of orthologous gene clusters for the two ectomycorrhizal species tuber melanosporum and cenococcum geophilum, the saprophyte/ericoid mycorrhizal species oidiodendron maius as well as p. subalpina. abbreviations of species are given in table  <dig>  color code: green: mycorrhizal species, red: plant pathogens, purple: soil saprotrophs and blue: p. subalpina

a total of  <dig>  interpro accessions were annotated among the  <dig> species included in the analysis. a plateau of approx.  <dig> – <dig>  distinct interpro accessions per species was observed when plotting the number of distinct interpro accessions per species against the total number of annotated interpro accessions per species . p. subalpina is represented by  <dig>  distinct interpro accessions, and the highest number was observed in the two saprophyte species t. reesei  and a. flavus . in contrast, mycorrhizal species and the obligate biotrophic pathogen b. graminis included a significantly lower number of interpro accessions.  <dig>  interpro accessions were significantly overrepresented in the p. subalpina genome compared to the average count for the other  <dig> ascomycetous species and  <dig>  interpro accessions were encoded >3x in the p. subalpina genome. mapping of the overrepresented interpro accessions against the gene ontology  showed that catabolic/metabolic processes, transporters, and interpro accessions involved in binding events were most frequent .  <dig>  of the interpro accessions were not linked with go annotations and p. subalpina included among others  <dig> gene models with the fungal heterokaryon incompatibility domain ,  <dig> gene models with the major facilitator superfamily domain  and  <dig> gene models with ankyrin repeats . moreover, several classes of cazymes contained interpro accessions without go annotation such as ipr <dig>  as well as ipr <dig>  and ipr <dig> . only,  <dig> interpro accessions were significantly underrepresented in p. subalpina. the underrepresented interpro accessions frequently showed uneven distributions in the  <dig> ascomycetous genomes, and some of the accessions  are most probably related to transposable elements. similarly to pca based on quartets analysis, pca based on interpro accessions overrepresented in pathogenic and saprophytic species placed p. subalpina either in the pathogenic cluster or the saprophytic cluster .table  <dig> enrichment of go terms for the overrepresented interpro accessions encoded in p. subalpina

eight hundred eighty one gene models in p. subalpina were classified in  <dig> different cazyme families resulting in  <dig> cazyme modules, which are significantly more than observed in the other ascomycetous species. the second most frequently found cazyme modules  were encoded by f. oxysporum. the genome of p. subalpina was especially rich in genes coding for glycoside hydrolases , glycosyltransferases  and redox enzymes . principal component analysis based on the frequency of cazyme modules involved in plant cell wall degradation  such as cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, cutin, and enzymes likely acting on different substrates separated p. subalpina from all genomes . especially modules involved in pectin breakdown were encoded in high copy numbers in the genomes of both p. subalpina and f. oxysporum but p. sublpina included also a higher number of modules for cellulose and hemicellulose degradation . the ectomycorrhizal species t. melanosporum and c. geophilum as well as the obligate biotrophic species b. graminis were separated due to the small number of pcwdes .fig.  <dig> pca analysis based on cazyme modules involved in plant cell wall degradation . principle component analysis based on the abundance of cazyme modules involved in cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and cutin breakdown. the sum of the number of cazyme modules per compound were used for the analysis. abbreviations of species are given in table  <dig>  color code: green: mycorrhizal species, red: plant pathogens, purple: soil saprotrophs and blue: p. subalpina





discussion
in the present study we sequenced the genome of the root endophyte phialocephala subalpina belonging to the phialocephala fortinii s.l. – acephala applanata species complex one of the most prevalent species in forest ecosystems. by comparative genomic analysis with the gene inventory of  <dig> other ascomycetous species we show that p. subalpina links pathogenic and saprophytic lifestyles.

genome expansion due to a large set of distinct genes in gene families
with a genome size of approximately  <dig>  mb, the p. subalpina genome is significantly larger than the average genome size of previously sequenced ascomycetous species  <cit> . genome expansions can be caused by various events including  genome duplications,  invasion of autonomous elements such as tes and expansion of repetitive sequences such as microsatellites and tandem repeats into the genome,  the number and length of introns and/or  the expansion of the gene inventory  <cit> . no evidence for large segmental duplications were observed in the p. subalpina genome by genome-wide alignments using coconut  <cit>  and the frequency of repeats in general and tes in special was small, considering the genome size . proliferation of te is counteracted by three processes which act at different stages of te proliferation. repeat induced point mutations  act on the dna level by introducing c to t transitions and reversing cpg to tpa dinucleotides in repeated regions  <cit> . mip  de-novo methylates repeated dna sequences  <cit>  and rna interference  suppresses te proliferation either by heterochromatin assembly or small interfering rnas, which silence te transcripts . indirect evidence that a rip mechanism is or was active in p. subalpina stems from the skewed dinucleotide distribution in repeat regions. rip is active during the sexual cycle  <cit>  but no sexual stage is known in p. subalpina. however, several lines of evidence suggest that sexual reproduction regularly occurs as  most pac populations showed no gametic disequilibrium,  mating types do not deviate from a 1: <dig> ratio in pac populations and  strong purifying selection was recorded in the mating type loci  <cit> . moreover, teleomorphs are known for phylogenetically closely related species such as phaeomollisia piceae or mollisia spp.  <cit> . therefore, it seems likely that field studies have overlooked the teleomorph of pac species so far  <cit> . common to the rip/mip process is that cytosine dna methyltransferase of the dnmt <dig> family play a key role  <cit> . homologs of cytosine dna methyltransferases were present in p. subalpina including two gene models closely related to n. crassa rid and one protein related to n. crassa dim <dig>  a fourth gene model found in p. subalpina  was closest related to masc <dig> of ascobolus immersus which was placed in a cluster exclusively with basidiomycete species in the study of amselem et al.  <cit> . however, additional analysis showed that also other leotiomycete species included masc <dig> homologs , sclerotinia borealis  and m. brunnea ) adding some additional notable exceptions of ascomycetous proteins in this cluster. beside the indirect evidence of rip/mip, p. subalpina included also rnai key enzymes such as dicer, argonaute and rdrp in multiple copies. based on these findings we hypothesize that p. subalpina has a well-developed arsenal of defense mechanisms in place to counteract the proliferation of tes which may explain the comparative low frequencies of tes.

no significant differences in intron length and the average intergenic distance were observed. however, the gene inventory was one of the largest among ascomycetes with  <dig>  annotated gene models resulting in  <dig>  to > <dig>  more gene models than in other ascomycetes. in the light of the broad host range and the broad geographical distribution of species belonging to the p. fortinii s.l. – a. applanata species complex  <cit>  an enlarged gene repertoire could be expected. however, even compared to other fungal species with broad host ranges such as s. sclerotiorum, b. cinerea and f. oxysporum the number of gene models is large  <cit> . the high numbers of gene models may be the result of the annotation of a large fraction of very short gene models  <cit>  or gene models including te fragments. in p. subalpina, no significant deviation in protein length distributions for low identity genes was observed and a large fraction of the low identity genes were covered by ests. moreover, particular attention was paid to mask tes. therefore, the expansions in the gene inventory of p. subalpina do not result from annotation artefacts. several factors contributed to the high number of gene models found in p. subalpina. first of all, p. subalpina showed a slightly higher fraction of putative paralogous genes than observed on average for the other  <dig> ascomycetous species. f. oxysporum showed the highest fraction of putative paralogous genes and this observation is due to large segmental genome duplication  <cit> . secondly, a significant number of gene models in p. subalpina were species-specific as they showed no significant hits in simap analysis. the high fraction of species-specific genes may be the result of the lifestyle of p. subalpina as well as the missing genome data of closely related species in the loramyces – vibrissea clade  <cit> . indeed, if the supposedly species-specific genes of p. subalpina were blasted against the recently announced genome of the closely related p. scopiformis  <cit> , 28% of the gene models showed significant blast hits . thirdly, significantly more interpro accessions were annotated in p. subalpina including  <dig>  gene models than in any other species used for comparison. the high number of annotated interpro accessions in the gene inventory did, however, not result in an expanded functional catalogue as the number of distinct interpro accessions per species reached a plateau at approx.  <dig> – <dig>  distinct accessions indicating that “more of the same” is present in p. subalpina.

our analyses show that the gene inventory of p. subalpina was also expanded to some extent by hgt from non-fungal organisms. a systematic analysis of the acquired prokaryotic genes by  <dig> fungal genomes by marcet-houben & gabaldón  <cit>  showed that species in the pezizomycotina exhibited a high incidence of inter-domain hgt including between  <dig> and  <dig> proteins per species. the  <dig> hgt events found in p. subalpina likely represents a lower limit of events and closer inspection of uncertain candidates will likely reveal additional hgt events. moreover, hgt events from other fungal species were shown to be another significant source for hgt  <cit> . the phylogenetically closest protein sequences often originated from species in the burkholderiales or actinomycetales that colonize soil and/or roots, i.e., they share their habitat with p. subalpina and rendering a hgt event likely.

in almost half of the cases, the hgt event was unique or occurred recently. in contrast, also older hgt events were detected that were characterized by the presence of multiple fungal species within a clade of non-fungal species  <cit> . interestingly, o. maius and p. scopiformis shared several of the  <dig> studied hgt events. it is possible that the hgt event occurred in a common ancestor as both fungi are related to p. subalpina . alternatively, it might be possible that these genes were introduced twice independently for o. maius as o. maius can also be found in similar habitats as p. subalpina. it is associated with roots of ericaceous shrubs and involved in the decomposition of sphagnum peat  <cit> . genes transferred by hgt can drive important evolutionary innovations as shown for plant pathogens . this was also observed in p. subalpina as several proteins were hydratases or peptidases. notably, two β-lactamases were included that are involved in the detoxification of β-lactam antibiotics  <cit>  and may result in a competitive advantage against other microbes.

the chameleonic genome of p. subalpina
the ecological role of members of the p. fortinii s.l.-a. applanata species complex is still poorly understood. they were described as beneficial, neutral or pathogenic for different hosts, growing conditions and fungal strains  <cit>  and even a role in mycorrhizal associations was hypothesized  <cit> . in order to shed light on the lifestyle of p. subalpina we compared the genome against  <dig> genomes of other ascomycetous species with different lifestyles. all our analyses showed that the gene inventory of p. subalpina supports multiple lifestyles. first, p. subalpina shared more putative orthologous genes with the two ectomycorrhizal species included in the analysis than any other species indicating some affinities with the two species. nevertheless, an important difference is evident. ecm fungi as well as obligate biotrophic pathogens are generally characterized by a reduced gene inventory especially for plant cell wall degrading enzymes   <cit> . however, p. subalpina encodes a high number of pcwdes. moreover, several ecm fungi and obligate biotrophic pathogens show genome expansions due to te proliferation  <cit>  which was absent in p. subalpina.

in contrast to ecm fungi, saprophytes and necrotrophic/hemibiotrophic pathogens are well endowed with enzymes involved in the degradation of plant material  <cit> . the main difference between these two groups is that the pathogenic species must have a specific gene inventory allowing them to invade hosts and overcome plant immune response, i.e., pathogen-associated molecular patterns  or damage-associated molecular patterns   <cit> . whereas necrotrophic pathogens kill the host tissue by secreting effectors like toxins and/or proteins, hemibiotrophic pathogens grow intracellularly. and form specialized structures such as haustoria for nutrient uptake  <cit> . recent comparative genome analysis showed that there are only few genes associated with plant pathogens that are absent in non-pathogens  <cit> . however, domains overrepresented in necrotrophic/hemibiotrophic pathogenic species compared to saprophytes were identified  <cit> . when our dataset was enriched for overrepresented interpro accessions in pathogens only few of the accessions were in accordance with soanes et al  <cit> . however, a closer look showed that also of the accessions listed by soanes et al  <cit>  were also overrepresented in our dataset yet with a factor <2x. irrespective of which interpro accession list was used for analysis, p. subalpina was placed close to the pathogenic species , indicating the robustness of the analysis. the list included genes with protease/peptidase domains, cutinases, pectinases, genes including a necrosis inducing domain or genes with chitin-binding modules. many of these gene classes were shown to play a pivotal role in plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . for example, pamp-induced host chitinases can either be overcome by the action of secreted proteases  <cit>  or the secretion of lysm effectors that may be coupled with a chitin-binding module  <cit> . the finding that p. subalpina includes the repertoire of pathogenic species fits well with the recent host-fungus interactions studies showing that pac strains behave along the antagonism-mutualism continuum and are localized rather towards antagonistic interactions as the colonization results in reduced biomass accumulation of the host  <cit> . however, strong strain-specific differences were observed in the outcome of the interaction with some strains killing the majority of the seedlings and others only marginally affecting the host  <cit>  and future studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. despite the pathogenic gene repertoire observed in p. subalpina, host defense mechanisms such as lignituber formation and cell wall appositions are rarely observed during the invasion of pac strains indicating that pac can manipulate/suppress the plant immune response  <cit> . although the precise mechanisms how p. subalpina suppresses host induced defense mechanisms are unknown, effectors such as small secreted proteins  predicted in the genome of p. subalpina may be candidates as they were shown to function as effectors in plant-fungal interactions  <cit>  and genome-wide differential gene expression studies during host colonization will help to identify possible effectors.

beside the pathogen-related gene repertoire, our analysis shows that p. subalpina has also affinities with saprophyte-specific genes indicating that the species includes the signature of both lifestyles in the genome. a very similar positioning in the analysis was observed for f. oxysporum. indeed, f. oxysporum not only includes the > <dig> pathogenic variants but non-pathogenic strains of f. oxysporum were also isolated as endophytes from asymptomatic roots .

both species share a high number of β-lactamase/β-lactamase-related genes with saprophytes involved in the detoxification of β-lactam antibiotics. β-lactamases are well known fungal defense effector proteins  <cit> , and detoxifying β-lactam antibiotics help to persist against antagonists. besides the β-lactamase genes, those coding for sulfatases and different hydrolases were also enriched in saprophytic species including p. subalpina and f. oxysporum. in contrast to most pathogenic species, p. subalpina showed also an enlarged repertoire of pcwdes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose breakdown as well as proteins with auxiliary activities supposed to be involved in lignin breakdown. indeed, a strain of p. fortinii s.l. was shown to cause soft rot in autoclaved wood of beech and conifer species indicating that members of the pac can degrade lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose  <cit> .

why does p. subalpina stand out of the crowd?
the answer of two fundamental questions is still pending:  why are pac species so amazingly successful in colonizing their hosts and  does the host also benefit from the colonization by pac. at least the second question may be answered by the genome sequence of p. subalpina.

although often hypothesized, endophytic fungi of forest trees were rarely shown to be mutualistic for their hosts  <cit> . however, the closely related needle endophyte p. scopiformis was shown to produce rugulosin, a potent secondary metabolite against herbivory  <cit> . similarly, interaction studies using pathogens , p. subalpina strains and p. abies seedlings showed that some of the p. subalpina strains effectively reduced mortality and disease intensity caused by the pathogens  <cit> . in addition, secondary metabolites were identified in pac species that inhibited phytophthora spp.  <cit> , and the genome of p. subalpina encodes a high number of secondary metabolite key enzymes. some of these are compatible with known pathways and products, such as melanin or ferrichrome-like siderophores. for example, enzymes pac_ <dig> and pac_ <dig> resemble sidc-like  and nps1-like  synthetases, i.e., two distinct types of ferrichrome-like siderophore-producing enzymes  <cit> . also, two non-reducing type i pkss of p. subalpina flanked by hydroxynaphthalene reductases likely involved in the melanin synthesis were recognized. whereas gene pac_ <dig> was placed in the same putative orthologous gene cluster as pks <dig> of g. lozoyensis, gene pac_ <dig> was placed in a second orthologous gene cluster and showed high similarities with the alm gene of a. alternata/the pksp/alb <dig> gene of a. fumigatus. all three proteins were experimentally shown to be involved in the melanin production . several leotiomycete species included genes in both clusters , whereas melanized non-helotialean species and g. lozoyensis were included in one of the clusters . moreover, no gene models of non-melanized species were included in one of these two clusters. to the best of our knowledge this is the first report for the duplication of the melanin pathway in ascomycetous fungi, although the redundancy of important secondary metabolite genes was reported previously  <cit> . still, the products of many of the secondary metabolite key enzymes and clusters remain unresolved. however, they may represent the chemical language of p. subalpina to interact via small molecules with host plants and other microorganisms in the rhizosphere.

although the biomass and turnover rates of fine roots in forest ecosystems largely depend upon tree species, age of forest stands and climate, estimates indicate that as much as 30% of the net primary production is used for fine root production  <cit> . in an abies alba stand for example > <dig>  t/ha fine roots biomass with a cumulative length of >  <dig>  km/ha was estimated  <cit>  showing the importance of fine roots as carbon source. given the fact that species of the p. fortinii s.l. – a. applanata species complex dominate many of the endophytic assemblages in fine roots of temperate and boreal forests  <cit> , pac species have access to a very substantial carbon source. p. subalpina can already colonize the future carbon source by entering healthy fine roots and may then switch to the saprophytic lifestyle as soon as the roots die off. indeed, the signature of both lifestyles was observed in the genome although studies about the importance of pac species in the fine root turnover are missing. moreover, the fungus can escape the highly competitive soil community by colonizing the roots  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of a globally distributed root endophyte allowed for detailed insights in the gene inventory and genome organization of a yet largely neglected group of organisms. our analysis showed that the genome of p. subalpina has a versatile genome including genes for both a pathogenic and saprophytic lifestyle but showed also some affinities with ectomycorrhizal species. the degree of pathogenicity among strains of p. subalpina is high, as observed in f. oxysporum. in f. oxysporum pathogenicity is driven by mobile pathogenicity chromosomes  <cit> . re-sequencing of multiple strains of p. subalpina will help identify the molecular basis of its pathogenicity. in addition, one central question will be to understand the evolutionary trajectory of pac, i.e.whether pac will become more pathogenic in future which would have a severe effect on forest ecosystems health, or whether the pac-host interaction gets less antagonistic.
