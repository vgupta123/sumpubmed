BACKGROUND
pollen tube growth and reorientation occur only at the extreme apex of the tube due to polarized fusion of secretory vesicles, which transport cell wall components to the growing tip  <cit> . this exocytic delivery of material to the extending apex is found in root hairs  <cit> , fungal hyphae  <cit>  and rhizoids  <cit> , all tip-growing cells. in pollen tubes, the membrane material provided by vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane was calculated to exceed the needs to maintain growth rates suggesting an underlying recycling process  <cit> . it was generally assumed that exocytosis events occur mostly at the extreme apex while membrane recycling  would take place further back from the tip, at the flanks of the apex and/or at sub-apical regions. several lines of evidence supported this hypothesis:  higher ca2+ values at the extreme apex  <cit>  which could favour exocytosis;  a higher concentration of pectin methylesterases  <cit> , sec-gfp and agp-gfps  <cit>  reported at the extreme apex;  the presence of an exocyst complex also reported at the extreme tip  <cit> ; and  the absence of clathrin-coated vesicles from the extreme apex in pollen tubes preserved by freeze-fixation  <cit> . however, some of these data only indirectly concerned secretion or were obtained with methods that precluded a proper analysis of vesicle dynamics. the use of fm styryl dyes  helped to generate a picture of vesicle and membrane dynamics during apical growth  <cit>  but no evidence is available at present to actually prove that these labels correspond to that of vesicles destined for exocytosis  <cit> . it nevertheless allowed us to generate other working hypothesis namely the existence of a rapid endocytosis  mechanism at the extreme apex coupled to a "conventional" mechanism with clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurring at sub-apical regions  <cit> .

in this work we tried to further dissect the secretory process by investigating the distribution and role of syntaxins during pollen tube growth. the syntaxins are a large evolutionarily conserved family of proteins required for docking and fusion of transport vesicles in eukaryotic cells. individual syntaxins reside on the organelles of the endomembrane system in which it is believed that they assemble with other proteins of the snare  family to form snare complexes  <cit> . syntaxins are classified on a structural base as qa-snares, they interact on the target membrane with two partners classified as qb- and qc-snares  <cit> . the snare complex on the target membrane  serves as a binding site for r-snares on the transport vesicle  and assures docking of the vesicle to target membrane driving membrane fusion  <cit> . mapping of these proteins in live cells can thus help to pinpoint exocytic events and their dynamics. using gfp-fusion proteins, we analysed the distribution of syp <dig>  a pollen-specific syntaxin , during pollen tube growth and upon modulation by inhibitors and regulatory proteins. although highly conserved, some research has suggested that individual members of particular gene families have distinct localizations and thus may have distinct functions  <cit> . so in order to test how specific is syp localization, we also transformed pollen with gfp-tagged, non-pollen specific, syp <dig> and syp <dig>  all three syps belong to the same sub-family of qa-snares, a family of  <dig> members with broad distribution inside the cell  <cit> . syp <dig> was reported to be involved in aba-related secretion  <cit>  while syp <dig> seems to have a more general function in secretion  <cit> , including a role in cell wall deposition  <cit> . here we report that gfp-syp <dig> showed a specific distribution with a higher labelling at the plasma membrane flanks, 10- <dig> μm behind the apex of growing pollen tubes and that this distribution is affected by regulators of membrane secretion .

RESULTS
to study the distribution of syntaxins during pollen tube growth, pollen of nicotiana tabacum was transiently transfected with a gfp-atsyp <dig> fusion construct with the chimera cloned downstream of the lat <dig> promoter  <cit> . this strategy had already been successfully used in previous studies . tobacco pollen is easily transformed using biolistics, the tubes are large, grow fast and they are more tolerant to the laser irradiation required for imaging . atsyp <dig> is a pollen-specific gene ) from a highly conserved family. to investigate if this specificity is translated into a specific distribution or if syntaxin distribution simply follows the cell's secretory requirements, we also transformed pollen with gfp fusion constructs of atsyp <dig> and atsyp <dig>  non-pollen syntaxins that have been previously characterized in protoplasts by us  <cit>  and with dominant-negative  versions of all three proteins.

syntaxins accumulate in apical vesicles and at the membrane flanks of the growing pollen tube
in actively growing pollen tubes  imaged 5- <dig> h after transformation, free gfp showed a uniform distribution throughout the cytoplasm . in cells expressing gfp-syp <dig> , the fluorescence mainly localized to the plasma membrane with a higher signal at the flanks of the pollen tube  and in the characteristic inverted cone of apical vesicles . when pollen tubes slowed down or ceased to grow, fluorescence was still visible associated to the plasma membrane but the higher apical vesicle labelling dissipated . over-expression of higher levels of gfp-syp <dig>  led to a significantly higher amount of fluorescence associated with the plasma membrane  and perturbations in apical morphology  but not to a significant disturbance of polarity. as recently described by mckenna et al.  <cit>  using phase-correlation analysis, we frequently observed that higher growth rates correlated with higher signals in the sub-apical membrane .

observations made in cells expressing the non-pollen syp <dig>  and syp <dig>  revealed also gfp-chimeras localization on the plasma membrane  in agreement with the highly conserved structure of these proteins . the distribution pattern of the non-pollen syp was nevertheless distinguishable from that of gfp-syp <dig>  with changes that could justify the specific expression profile in different tissues. the fluorescence distribution at the plasma membrane, even at regions further back from the sub-apex , was more uniform with syp <dig> and syp <dig> . this pattern was more similar to the labelling provided by fm1- <dig> and fm4- <dig> dyes , indicative of less specific sorting. higher levels of either gfp-syp <dig> or gfp-syp <dig> led to saturation of plasma membrane fluorescence but to no changes in pollen morphology .

syntaxin localization at membranes is influenced by c levels
to test if the sub-cellular localization of syntaxins was affected by changes in c levels , pollen tubes expressing gfp-fusion constructs of syp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were imaged before and after addition of  <dig> μm gadolinium chloride or  <dig> ,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-octyl ester . gadolinium  is an inhibitor of plasma membrane cationic channels, preventing ca2+ influx, while tmb- <dig> inhibits intracellular ca2+ mobilization  <cit> . at this concentration both inhibitors transiently reduced growth rate but allowed fast recovery upon wash-out .

gd3+ had a similar effect in the localization pattern of all three syntaxins. in pollen tubes expressing gfp-syp <dig>  along with a reduction in growth rate, the addition of this ion to the extracellular medium caused a transient but significant  reduction in the association of the fluorescent signal with the apical  and sub-apical plasma membrane  . however, the signal associated with both apical and sub-apical cytoplasmic regions exhibited no significant changes . the fluorescent signal of syp <dig> and syp <dig> was also found to reduce upon addition of gd3+  but in contrast to syp <dig>  the reduction was below our significance threshold. this suggests that influx of extracellular ca2+ is important for specific syp localization  at the plasma membrane but not to their trafficking through secretory vesicles. we further quantified if the reduced accumulation at the plasma membrane upon addition of gd3+ was higher in the apical or sub-apical region. in all three syntaxins, the reduction was found to be slightly higher in the sub-apical region but this difference was also below our significance threshold.

tmb- <dig> had a reduced effect in the localization of all three syntaxins . its addition caused a transient reduction in plasma membrane and cytoplasmic fluorescence for syp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> but changes were non significant  in contrast with the inhibition of growth rates. these observations suggest that the effects are likely to be a consequence of growth rate inhibition and not directly of intracellular ca2+ modulation.

syntaxins localization is regulated by signalling pathways
the recent modelling of kato et al.  <cit>  suggests that, although essential, syntaxins play more of a structural than a regulatory role in the secretory process. to further investigate this we devised a set of experiments where syntaxins were co-expressed with a truncated version consisting only in the n-terminal portion of syp  <cit>  or with known regulatory proteins of the secretory pathway .

the co-expression of full gfp-syp <dig> with its truncated version  led to no visible change in pollen tube morphology or growth rate. however, the localization pattern of syp <dig> at the plasma membrane shifted with regions further back from the sub-apex now more evidently labelled . this pattern resembles the localization of the non-pollen syps  and suggests a perturbation in the interaction of syp <dig> with its targets. in agreement with a specificity issue, the localization pattern of syp <dig> or  <dig> was not changed by the co-expression with their respective truncated versions .

the co-expression of gfp-syp <dig> with pip5k <dig> led to a different scenario. it was recently shown that over-expression of pip5k <dig>  a protein that normally concentrates in the flanks of the pollen tubes, perturbs pollen tube morphology and affects secretion  <cit> . here we found that co-expression , along with a disturbance in polarity, caused changes in gfp-syp <dig> localization . accompanying the partial loss of polarity, the association of gfp fluorescence with the apical plasma membrane increased, the typical higher labelling of the apical cytoplasm dissipated , and some cells  exhibited large labelled structures in the cytoplasm that extended to the apical region . similar results were obtained when co-expression was performed with gfp-syp <dig> or with gfp-syp <dig>  and indicate a modulation of syntaxin trafficking and distribution by the phosphoinositide signalling pathway.

syntaxin activity was also recently shown to be modulated by small gtpases of the rab sub-family, namely rab <dig>  <cit> . in pollen tubes, expression of a dominant-negative gdp-bound version of rab <dig> was shown to induce depolarization of the growth axis and to disturb membrane trafficking  <cit> . therefore we co-expressed a dominant-negative gdp-bound rab11dn together with gfp-syp <dig>  this co-expression led to significant changes in pollen tube tip morphology, occasional depolarization and also to altered syp localization . as observed with the co-expression of pip5k <dig>  the association of syp with the apical plasma membrane increased and the typical higher labelling of apical vesicles dissipated . furthermore, the expression of the rab11dn led to the labelling of large structures in the apex that could result from vesicle aggregation or large vesicles formation . similar results were obtained when co-expression was performed with gfp-syp <dig> or with gfp-syp <dig> .

discussion
the use of gfp-syntaxin fusion constructs to analyse secretion in pollen tubes
although essential for understanding pollen tube apical growth, the location and dynamics of exocytic events is still controversial  <cit> . gfp fusion proteins have been used linked to secreted proteins  <cit>  so the localization reflects their accumulation and not necessarily the point of vesicle fusion  <cit> . zonia and munnik  <cit>  took advantage of the complementary emission spectra of fm1- <dig> and fm4- <dig> to perform an elegant experiment where the pollen tubes were first labelled with one dye until the endomembrane compartments were saturated and all exocytic vesicles labelled. the authors then imaged the cells shortly after addition of the second dye; the assumption was that the later will label only endocytic vesicles. by comparing the two signals the authors suggested that exocytosis takes place in the flanks of the pollen tube while at the extreme apex endocytosis prevails. although limited by the characteristics of the dyes, this hypothesis raises new questions concerning the localization of the exocytic machinery and vesicle dynamics in the pollen tube apex. here we analysed the localization and dynamics of syntaxin proteins which are required for docking and fusion of secretory vesicles  <cit> . expression of the pollen-specific syp <dig> fused to gfp did not affect pollen tube growth rate or morphology and comparison with data obtained using non-pollen syntaxins  revealed different and specific dynamics. as expected for such protein, the gfp fluorescent signal was strongly associated to the plasma membrane and secretory vesicles in the apical region thus strengthening the use of gfp-syp <dig> as a marker for the study of secretory events in pollen tubes.

syntaxins accumulate at the plasma membrane flanks and in apical vesicles of the growing pollen tube
we found that gfp-tagged syp <dig> mostly localizes to vesicles in the apical inverted cone and to the plasma membrane at the flanks of the growing pollen tube, 10- <dig> μm behind the tip. this pattern suggests that the preferential location for fusion is on a limited membrane domain at the sub-apical flanks and not at the extreme apex , in agreement with the recent hypothesis of an annulus shaped release zone  <cit> . the observation that membrane fluorescence extends to regions further back from the apex is likely explained by diffusion of the gfp-syp <dig> when its ligands  are saturated. when the tubes slowed down  the protein seemed to spread to the extreme apex of the tube and to regions further back from the sub-apical region. in a recent work, enami et al.  <cit>  also looked at the localization of atsyp <dig> and showed its localization all over the plasma membrane and in the apical region. but in this case a critical interpretation is required because the work was done in arabidopsis pollen, a system where is notoriously difficult to obtain proper imaging of growth and cell dynamics. thus our option for using an heterologous system - tobacco pollen - where such limitations are minor and which have been used as a valid model to analyse the sub-cellular localization of arabidopsis protein  <cit> . the data must be interpreted bearing in mind these advantages and limitations.

imaging of the non-pollen syp <dig> and syp <dig> showed significant differences from syp <dig> in the wider labelling of plasma membrane regions. given the high degree of conservation in this protein sub-family, the data suggests that tissue-specificity may be relevant to assign interaction with membrane targets and not to determine rates of vesicle fusion. this hypothesis gain support by the co-expression experiments of syp <dig> with its truncated version deleted of the transmembrane domain but still able to interact with the other partners of the snare complex  <cit> . this co-expression resulted in a less confined accumulation of syp <dig> at the plasma membrane. in other experimental systems , the co-expression of truncated soluble variant of syps induced an alteration of the corresponding gfp-tagged full-length protein distribution pattern  <cit> . this was due to the dominant negative potential of the truncated form that competes with the native protein for the snare partner but has minimal impact on the formation of functional complexes  <cit> . consequently, the "pool" of interactors with the non-mutated syp is reduced and the protein will flow on the membrane differently.

syntaxins play a structural role and are modulated by multiple signalling pathways
calcium is a known regulator of membrane secretion and of pollen tube growth  <cit> . snare fusion is inherently ca2+-insensitive but an increase in ca2+ enhances snare-mediated liposome fusion  <cit> . we thus tested if the labelling intensity of syp localization was affected by changes in the extracellular influx or intracellular release of ca2+. in such experiments we resorted to low concentrations of specific chemical inhibitors that have been widely tested in plant cells  <cit> . but the results must nevertheless be interpreted with caution as one cannot rule out the possibility of side effects. when influx was partially blocked, a transient reduction was observed in the syp <dig> fluorescence associated to the plasma membrane consistent with a reduction in fusion rates but continued membrane recycling. when we instead blocked the intracellular release of ca2+, changes in syps distribution at the plasma membrane were not significant in agreement with recent findings that exocytosis is not profoundly affected by intracellular c  <cit> .

consistent with previous finding that pip5k <dig> modulates secretion and membrane recycling  <cit>  we found that co-expression of pip5k <dig> leads to altered distribution of syps. namely, syp <dig> is displaced and accumulates at the extreme apex and also in large endomembrane structures. this is in agreement with previous reports that ptdinsp <dig>  helps to mark the plasma membrane as the appropriate target for vesicle fusion  <cit>  and that ptdinsp <dig> levels are known to positively correlate with the pool of secretory vesicles  <cit> .

a similar effect was observed upon co-expression with a rab <dig> dn mutant which was reported to modulate exocytosis in protoplasts  <cit>  and to be crucial for tip growth in pollen tubes  <cit> . the observed effect of the rab11dn confirms the role of these small rab gtpases in the targeting of vesicles to the plasma membrane. taken together these data suggests that syntaxins play mostly a structural role in pollen tube growth rather than specifying the rate of vesicle delivery. their turnover and localization most likely follows the changes triggered by the multiple signalling pathways acting on pollen tube secretion. the data also agrees with the theoretical predictions of kato et al.  <cit>  that a knockout of syp <dig> will not affect tube length; only a double knockout of syp <dig> and syp <dig>  will have an effect. however, it should be noted that syntaxins are only one element of the complex machinery required for vesicle fusion and that other factors might be limiting the effect of syp <dig>  additional work is required to characterize the function of syntaxins in plant fertilization.

CONCLUSIONS
it was recently proposed that a rapid endocytosis mechanism might occur in the apex of rapidly growing pollen tubes  <cit> . this mechanism is a ca2+-dependent process, coupled to exocytosis which does not require clathrin  <cit> . this rapid endocytosis could operate in parallel to a system where endo- and exocytosis are uncoupled. the uncoupling would be favoured when cell growth is arrested or it is slowed down  as it occurs in situations where the cell needs to interpret extracellular cues and reorient the growth axis. evidence for the existence of two endocytic modes has been obtained in pollen tubes  <cit>  and all the required molecular components have been identified . the localization here reported for the pollen-specific syp <dig> and its modulation by different signaling mechanisms fits this hypothesis. the changes observed on syp <dig> distribution upon growth modulation possibly reflect a repositioning of the vesicle's docking machinery and highlight the importance of syntaxins in secretion and tip growth.
