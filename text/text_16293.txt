BACKGROUND
the protein encoded by the mammalian delta-like  <dig>  is related to members of the notch-delta family of signalling molecules, but differs in several key respects from other members of this family. dlk <dig> produces multiple alternatively spliced transcripts, giving rise to protein isoforms which are either membrane-bound or proteolytically cleaved and secreted . dlk <dig> has evoked considerable interest because in mammals it is a paternally expressed imprinted gene that is epigenetically regulated, and defective imprinting of dlk <dig> results in developmental abnormalities  <cit> . furthermore, targeted deletion of dlk <dig> in mice results in growth retardation, skeletal malformation and obesity  <cit>  and transgenic mice ectopically expressing ovine dlk <dig> in some muscle fibres, exhibit muscle fibre hypertrophy  <cit> . the developmental mechanisms leading to these abnormalities are unknown and in particular it is unclear the extent to which this protein has the capability of regulating notch signalling in vivo, because it lacks an essential extracellular dsl domain common to all known notch ligands.

notch-ligands are transmembrane proteins that are characterised by a series of egf-repeats in their extracellular domain, and an n-terminal domain, referred to as the dsl domain . the latter appears to be critical for the interactions between the ligands and the notch receptor  <cit> . although dlk <dig> contains  <dig> egf-repeats that are closely related to those found in delta and serrate/jagged, and can bind to notch egf repeats in a yeast two-hybrid assay  <cit> , it lacks the n-terminal dsl-domain which is required for receptor binding and activity of known ligands ; it also differs from characterised notch ligands because its intracellular domain is considerably shorter. truncation of the intracellular domain renders drosophila or xenopus delta proteins incapable of activating the receptor  <cit> . both its lack of a dsl-domain and its short intracellular domain suggest therefore that dlk <dig> would not be able to function as a notch ligand. however, as an inverse correlation between dlk <dig> levels and notch activity have been observed in cultured cells, it is possible that dlk <dig> could be a receptor antagonist  <cit> .

the notch pathway is highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom and has been most extensively studied in drosophila where it was first identified  <cit> . unlike mammals, which have  <dig> different notch receptors, drosophila has a single receptor and provides a simple system to test whether dlk <dig> has the capability to regulate notch in vivo and whether it acts positively or negatively. this approach has successfully been used to investigate functions of bone fide mammalian delta ligands, two of which were effective in activating drosophila notch  <cit> . we therefore generated transgenic flies that express dlk <dig> isoforms under the control of the gal4/uas system  <cit>  and tested for phenotypes indicative of alterations in notch function.

RESULTS
phenotypes from expressing dlk <dig> in the drosophila wing
three different dlk <dig> variants were constructed that mimic the different isoforms detected in vivo: s-dlk, a secreted form produced by proteolytic cleavage in the extracellular domain, m-dlk, transmembrane tethered form that lacks the cleavage site, sm-dlk retains the cleavage site and thus has the capacity to be both membrane tethered and cleaved . we used a series of different gal <dig> driver lines to express these proteins in the developing wing and assessed the adults for phenotypes that would be indicative of effects on notch activity.

notch activity is required at many different stages in wing/notum development. characteristic phenotypes of notch gain of function are wing over-growth, ectopic wing margin structures, loss of veins and bristle loss  <cit> . phenotypes caused by notch loss of function are notching of the wing margin, vein thickening and bristle duplication/tufting or bristle loss  <cit> . the apparently contradictory effects on bristles occur because notch is involved both in the selection of the sensory organ precursor  cells and in the fates within each bristle lineage  <cit> . expression of drosophila ligands in the wing produces characteristics of both notch activation and inhibition. the latter occurs in the cells expressing highest levels of ligands, and is due to an autonomous inhibitory effect on the receptor referred to as cis-inhibition  <cit> . expression of mammalian ligands in similar assays either resulted primarily in notch activation  or had no effect , none had robust cis-inhibitory effects  <cit> .

when dlk <dig> protein was expressed in the wing using several different gal <dig> drivers we detected phenotypes that were consistent with a reduction in notch activity, including wing notching, vein thickening and bristle duplications . in all cases m-dlk produced the strongest phenotypes, sm-dlk resulted in much milder phenotypes and the secreted isoform, s-dlk, had little or no effect. the latter may not be surprising because notch ligands appear to require ubiquitinylation of the intracellular domain and coupling with endocytosis to be active  <cit> . the secreted isoform would not undergo the necessary modifications.

to further investigate the consequences of expressing dlk <dig> we focussed on the ptc::gal <dig> driver which is expressed in a stripe in the central region of the wing and in the scutellum . we used two approaches to vary the levels of expression. we tested effects at 25°c and 30°c, the higher temperature increasing the effectiveness of the gal <dig>  and we compared phenotypes from one and two copies of the transgenes. expression from one copy of m-dlk at 25°c resulted in highly penetrant phenotypes of wing notches and multiple sense-organs, indicative of reduced notch activity . both defects were strongly enhanced at 30°c. in contrast, minor defects of occasional bristle duplications were produced using one copy of sm-dlk . the bristle defects were more penetrant with two copies of sm-dlk and occasional wings had mild-notching . these effects were considerably enhanced at 30°c . thus both m-dlk and sm-dlk produce defects consistent with an antagonistic effect on notch. the transgene producing the membrane tethered m-dlk has a much more potent effect.

in addition to the notch-related defects, we also observed effects on cell proliferation. in particular, expression of sm-dlk resulted in fewer cells in the domain of expression . within the reduced domain the individual cells were larger than normal. in contrast, expression of the m-dlk caused a slight increase in cell number in the domain of expression . together these data suggest that dlk <dig> affects cell growth or proliferation, and that the different isoforms may have distinct inputs on this process. furthermore, although there is evidence that notch can influence cell proliferation in the wing  <cit> , effects on cell size were not seen in other experiments where notch activity was modulated by ptc::gal <dig> ). thus, effects on cell size seen with sm-dlk may be suggestive of additional target or may reveal a novel aspect of notch function.

n ≥  <dig> flies per genotype. see figure  <dig> for areas used for counting. reducing the dosage of notch  does not influence cell numbers.

some dlk <dig> expression phenotypes are enhanced by notch mutations
to confirm that phenotypes produced by m-dlk and sm-dlk are due to effects on notch, we asked whether they could be enhanced if the levels of notch were reduced in flies heterozygous for a loss-of-function notch allele . heterozygosity for notch alone produces mild wing nicking, slight broadening of the veins at the tips  and occasional duplication of the scutellar macrochaetae . even taking into account the effects of notch mutation on the wing margin, the frequency and the extent of wing notching from both m-dlk and sm-dlk was enhanced in n/+ females . furthermore, the effects of bristle duplication were also significantly enhanced . thus by two different criteria, the phenotypes produced by dlk <dig> are enhanced by reducing the amount of notch protein present, indicating that dlk <dig> is antagonising the activity of the drosophila notch receptor.

although most of the effects of dlk <dig> expression are enhanced by notch mutations, the wings from notch/+; ptc::gal4/uas::sm-dlk have a similar size and number of cells in the domain of expression to those with wild-type dose of notch. this is consistent with the hypothesis that the effects on cell size are independent of an action on notch raising the possibility that there is an additional target of dlk <dig> 

effects of dlk <dig> expression on notch targets in the wing imaginal disk
if dlk <dig> is antagonising notch activity we would expect to see down-regulation of notch target genes in the wing imaginal disc. we examined effects of expressing m-dlk and sm-dlk on two notch targets. expression of the transcription factor cut at the wing margin  is dependent on the activity of the notch and wingless pathways  <cit> . the cut regulatory sequences contain binding sites for the dna-binding protein su  suggesting that it is a direct target of notch activation  <cit> . cut expression was strongly inhibited by expression of m-dlk and subtly reduced by expression of sm-dlk . in addition, occasionally there was some ectopic cut detected at the boundary of m-dlk expression in the ventral part of the wing . this suggests that m-dlk may also have some activating potential but only in the ventral domain, where the fringe glycosyl-transferase is absent. in this respect dlk- <dig> appears more similar in function to serrate, which is only able to activate notch molecules that are not modified by fringe  <cit> .

the second target used was the enhancer of split mβ gene mβ), which is expressed in response to notch in a more widespread pattern in the wing mβ::cd <dig> throughout the domain of misexpression  sm-dlk had weaker but still significant inhibitory effects . the inhibition of both emβ and cut expression confirms that expression of dlk <dig> is antagonising notch activity. as this inhibition occurs within the domain of ligand expression, it most likely represents cis-inhibition, i.e. effects on the receptor in the same cell. however we cannot rule out the possibility that there are slight non-autonomous inhibitory effects with m-dlk, as the epithelium often becomes deformed around the domain of expression.

we also wanted to verify that the effects of dlk <dig> on bristles reflect a reduction in notch activity, because some of the adult phenotypes  can also be brought about by increased notch activity. we therefore looked at a marker of sensory-organ precursors, senseless  <cit> . if dlk <dig> is antagonising notch activity we would expect an increase the number of sensory organ precursors in a given cluster. this is what was observed in the clusters that will form the chordotonal sensory organs of the dorsal and ventral radius . both m-dlk and sm-dlk increase the number of senseless-expressing precursors in these clusters, with m-dlk having the stronger effect .

m-dlk and sm-dlk show different cellular locations and effects on notch protein
the differing severity of the m-dlk and sm-dlk might in part be due to the transgenes being expressed at different levels. however, the fact that even increasing the dosage and temperature failed to properly redress the difference, and that the two proteins had distinct effects on proliferation suggested that there are intrinsic differences in the behaviours of the proteins. to investigate these questions we stained wing discs with an antibody that recognises dlk <dig>  this revealed a striking difference in the behaviour of the two proteins. m-dlk had a cortical/membrane distribution , whereas sm-dlk accumulated at highest levels basally, although some membrane associated protein was detectable .

co-staining with anti-notch antibody revealed that m-dlk strongly affects the distribution of the endogenous notch protein . the levels of notch are elevated in m-dlk expressing cells, and there is more protein accumulating at or close to the membrane of these cells. both these effects suggest that m-dlk has an action on notch that stabilises the protein. notch distribution is much less affected by sm-dlk, despite the fact that this isoform consistently accumulates to much higher levels than m-dlk . nevertheless in some cells we also observed redistribution of notch to co-localise with the sm-dlk . we take this co-variance in notch localisation with the expressed dlk isoforms to indicate that they are able to interact, since this resembles the effects seen with expression of known ligands with functional dsl domains  <cit> . in contrast, in these previous studies, ligands with a mutated dsl domain were not able to influence notch distribution  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
dlk <dig> can regulate notch signalling despite its atypical structure
our data indicate that dlk <dig> has the capability to regulate notch receptors in spite of the fact that it lacks an n-terminal dsl domain. this in vivo functional demonstration that dlk <dig> can affect drosophila notch signalling and is consistent with yeast two-hybrid data showing interaction of dlk <dig> with notch <dig> egf repeats  <cit> . that this interaction has likely functional consequences in mammals in vivo, is supported by evidence suggesting that dlk <dig> can modulate levels of notch signalling in adipogenic cells in culture  <cit> . in our assay the effects of dlk <dig> appear to be largely inhibitory. this is in contrast to the effects seen when the typical mammalian delta ligands dll <dig>  dll <dig> and dll <dig> were expressed in flies  <cit> . in those experiments, both dll <dig> and dll <dig> were able to activate drosophila notch, and dll <dig> had no effect. neither dll <dig> not the other two ligands produced inhibitory effects similar to those seen here with dlk <dig>  thus, these effects are likely to reflect specific characteristics of dlk <dig> itself.

notch ligands have the unusual characteristic that they inhibit the notch receptors present on the same cell, as well as activating receptors on adjacent cells  <cit> . it is the autonomous cis-inhibitory activity that we detect with dlk <dig>  with little or no evidence for activation. furthermore, the effects are most profound when we use a membrane-tethered form of dlk <dig> . however, our results with dlk <dig> do not a priori indicate that dlk <dig> acts solely as an inhibitor at the membrane. the ability of ligands to activate the notch receptors is affected by glycosylation  <cit>  and it is possible that the glycosylation state of the drosophila notch is incompatible with dlk <dig> activation. it is also possible that species-specific differences in endocytosis, in interactions with adaptor proteins, or in ligand specificities might also influence the outcome in our experiments. furthermore, mammalian cells have  <dig> notch receptors, and while two of these  contain the same number of extracellular egf repeats as drosophila notch, the others  have fewer and may have different interactions/ligand pairings. thus the outcome of dlk <dig> actions could differ according to which specific notch receptor or ligand-receptor pairing is affected. nevertheless our results do show that dlk <dig> has the ability to regulate notch signalling particularly when membrane tethered; hence it is likely to be an important factor acting on this pathway in mammalian development.

during mammalian embryogenesis, dlk <dig> is expressed in many of the key lineages known to depend on notch signalling for appropriate development, including somite derivatives  <cit> . the relative expression of dlk <dig> and the more typical notch ligands may therefore play an important role in modulating the temporal and spatial control of notch signalling in these cells. once the expression and function of dlk <dig> in situ is better characterised, this may shed light on which of the mammalian receptors is likely to be a target of dlk <dig>  what the functional relationships between dlk <dig> and other notch ligands are, and whether dlk <dig> acts positively as well as antagonistically on notch receptors.
