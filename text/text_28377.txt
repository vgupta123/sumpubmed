BACKGROUND
paracoccidioidomycosis  is the most prevalent systemic mycosis in latin america. epidemiological data indicate a broad geographic distribution in central and south america, from mexico to argentina  <cit> . it is estimated that as many as ten million individuals may be infected with p. brasiliensis in this part of the world. infection occurs primarily in the lungs, from where it can disseminate via the bloodstream and/or lymphatic system to many organ systems, resulting in the disseminated form of pcm  <cit> .

considering the pathogenesis of this disease, the initial stages are of importance since this is when resident pulmonary macrophages interact with the fungus for the first time and become activated.

in this context, multiple characteristics have been proposed as virulence factors that enable the invading organism to cause disseminated infections in susceptible hosts. the ability to recognize and adhere to host tissues, to respond rapidly to changes in the external environment, and to secrete enzymes are all thought to play important roles in virulence. secretion of enzymes, such as phospholipases, has been proposed as one of the strategies used by bacteria, parasites, and pathogenic fungi for invasion of the host and establishment of infection  <cit> .

the role of extracellular phospholipases, particularly phospholipase b , as potential virulence factors for pathogenic fungi, including candida albicans  <cit> , cryptococcus neoformans  <cit> , and aspergillus fumigatus  <cit>  has been reported, although the underlying mechanism has yet to be elucidated. extracellular phospholipase activities have also been detected in in-vitro cultures of p. brasiliensis  <cit> , and plb has been postulated as a potential virulence factor for this pathogen by in-silico analysis  <cit> .

phospholipases are ubiquitous enzymes that are involved in a wide range of biological functions, such as membrane homeostasis, nutrient acquisition, and generation of bioactive molecules. these enzymes are known to contribute to bacterial and fungal virulence through a variety of different interactions with eukaryotic host cells,  <cit>  and to modulate the innate and acquired immune response of the host by generating second messengers such as diacylglycerol or the eicosanoid precursor arachidonic acid  <cit> . furthermore, phospholipase-mediated il- <dig> release induces the host inflammatory response  <cit> .

it has been shown that secreted plb <dig>  a proven virulence determinant of c. neoformans, is required for the initiation of interstitial pulmonary cryptococcosis, being important for the binding of this fungus to human lung epithelial cells prior to its internalization  <cit> . plb <dig>  the product of the cnplb <dig> gene, is a multifunctional enzyme which can degrade dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine , the main component of lung surfactant  <cit> .

the goal of this work was to determine whether p. brasiliensis plb is involved in adhesion of this fungus to and internalization by alveolar macrophage  cells. also, we investigated the role of this enzyme in virulence and modulation of the alveolar pulmonary immune response during infection using alexidine dihydrochloride as a specific plb inhibitor, as well as pulmonary surfactant  as a substrate rich in phospholipids.

RESULTS
the first contact between p.brasiliensis and the host occurs by inhalation of the infectious propagules from the environment. plb has been reported as a potential virulence factor by transcriptome analysis in p. brasiliensis  <cit> . furthermore, experiments performed by our group showed that the plb <dig> gene is up-regulated during the early events of murine pulmonary infection in a paracoccidioidomycosis model , suggesting a possible role for this enzyme in the host-pathogen interaction and reinforcing the hypothesis that plb could be an important virulence factor for p. brasiliensis.

in c. neoformans, plb is necessary for the early events of pulmonary infection and for dissemination from the lung via the lymphatic system and blood  <cit> . specifically, adhesion to alveolar macrophage cells is reduced in a plb deletion mutant of c. neoformans and also in the presence of selective chemical inhibitors of plb and a specific anti-plb antibody. the extent of adhesion was correlated with plb activity, but not with lysophospholipase  or lysophospholipase transacylase  activity  <cit> .

lack of established protocols for conducting experiments that might lead to gene disruption or silencing in p. brasiliensis hinders the validation of the plb gene functionality in this pathogen. in view of this fact, we decided to investigate the role of plb using an in-vitro model of host-pathogen interaction, i.e. the yeast cells of p. brasiliensis infecting mh-s cells. the use of a specific inhibitor and/or an activator of plb could be an effective strategy for investigating the possible role of this enzyme during host-pathogen interaction.

effects of alexidine dihydrochloride and pulmonary surfactant on cell viability, adhesion, internalization, and plb activity during co-cultivation of p. brasiliensis and mh-s cells
in order to verify whether the treatment with alexidine dihydrochloride and pulmonary surfactant interferes with cell viability, colony-forming unit  analysis was performed after co-cultivation of p. brasiliensis and mh-s cells. cell viability of p. brasiliensis was evaluated by cfu analysis after treatment with the plb inhibitor  and  <dig> μg ml- <dig> pulmonary surfactant. the percentage of cell viability was not significantly altered  <dig> h post-infection .

to further investigate the role of plb we evaluated the percentage of p. brasiliensis yeast cells adhered to or internalized by mh-s cells after pulmonary surfactant and alexidine dihydrochloride treatments. the addition of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> pulmonary surfactant increased plb activity by 28% , leading to a strong positive effect on the internalization of p. brasiliensis , at least a 3-fold increase in comparison with the control. also, the proportion of internalized yeast cells  was higher than the proportion of yeast cells adhered to macrophage surfaces . in contrast, we found that  <dig>  μm alexidine dihydrochloride caused an 8-fold inhibition in the levels of phagocytosis by mh-s cells compared with the control . no effects of alexidine dihydrochloride or pulmonary surfactant on adhesion and internalization of heat-killed p. brasiliensis were observed .

phospholipase b activities were assayed after  <dig> h of co-cultivation of alveolar macrophage  cells with p. brasiliensis yeast cells with pulmonary surfactant  and alexidine dihydrochloride , as well as without treatment , as described in materials and methods. *significantly different from the untreated control, p <  <dig>  by the paired 2-tailed student's t-test. results are means ± sem of triplicate assays.

a role for plb activity in adhesion of c. neoformans to lung epithelial cells has already been proposed  <cit> ; dppc is predicted to be the favored lipid substrate for plb, leading to the production of glycerophosphocholine and free palmitic acid. in this context, it is hypothesized that the addition of pulmonary surfactant  would increase the adhesion of p. brasiliensis yeast cells to mh-s cells. these results strongly suggest that plb activity is important in p. brasiliensis adhesion to and/or internalization by mh-s cells.

in the present study, enzyme activities were tested under conditions used for adhesion . p. brasiliensis produced high levels of plb at  <dig> h post-infection.  <dig>  μm alexidine dihydrochloride selectively inhibited plb activity by 66%. in contrast, plb activity in the presence of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> pulmonary surfactant was significantly increased  compared to the control experiment.

modulation of p. brasiliensis and mh-s genes in the host-pathogen interaction
real-time quantitative reverse-rranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction  analysis confirmed that the plb <dig> , sod <dig> , and icl <dig>  genes were up-regulated in p. brasiliensis yeast cells during  <dig> h of interaction with mh-s cells in the presence of pulmonary surfactant. the sod <dig> gene presented a  <dig> -fold increase in expression  and under these conditions a higher percentage of yeast cell internalization was observed . in addition, the icl <dig> and plb <dig> genes presented  <dig> -fold and 2-fold increases in their transcripts levels, respectively. however, in the presence of alexidine dihydrochloride, the levels of transcripts strongly decreased, reaching  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold for plb <dig>  sod  <dig>  and icl <dig>  respectively .

p. brasiliensis metabolic adaptation in response to phagocytosis involves the induction of sod <dig>  which encodes a putative cu, zn sod, an enzyme participating in the elimination of superoxide anions. in-silico analysis showed that p. brasiliensis sod <dig> corresponds to a putative membrane-bound, glycosylphosphatidylinisotol -anchored cu, zn sod, which would allow for better accessibility to host-derived superoxide anions and subsequent rapid detoxification of reactive oxygen intermediates   <cit> . the up-regulation of sod <dig> expression in p. brasiliensis internalized by pulmonary surfactant-treated mh-s cells provides evidence that sod <dig> may also be needed for the elimination of generated superoxides, thus increasing yeast cell survival. this suggests that the sod <dig> gene is probably involved in the survival of p. brasiliensis, corroborating previous data  <cit> .

induction of the glyoxylate cycle upon phagocytosis has been described as an important adaptation by pathogens to the glucose-poor environment within macrophages, since it facilitates the assimilation of two-carbon compounds, the product of fatty acid degradation  <cit> . in p. brasiliensis, both isocitrate lyase and the entire glyoxylate pathway have been shown to be enhanced under low glucose and oxygen tension, in the presence of acetate and high temperature, as well as during intracellular growth  <cit> . our results showed that the icl <dig> gene was up-regulated under increased plb activity, which could be correlated with the fungal survival inside macrophage cells.

the results observed for the gene expression of plb <dig>  sod <dig>  and icl <dig> suggest that, under in-vitro conditions mimicking the lung-environment interaction, gene re-programming was similar to that described for peritoneal macrophages  <cit> , corroborating the importance and effective participation of those genes in the process of adaptation by the fungus to this inhospitable environment.

the process of recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns  depends on the pattern recognition receptors  present in great diversity in the plasma membrane of phagocytes  <cit> . the two main members of this family that recognize fungal components are the c-type lectin-like receptors  and toll-like receptors   <cit> .

to investigate whether p. brasiliensis plb is able to affect the inflammatory response of mh-s cells, we assessed the transcription level of the following key genes: tnf-α , il-1β , nkrf , and nfkb , known to be involved in the phagocytic process, and trl <dig> , cd <dig> , and clec <dig> , signal receptors involved in controlling the immune response. these genes had already been reported to be differentially expressed by peritoneal macrophages infected with p. brasiliensis  <cit> .

in our experiments, trl <dig>  cd <dig>  il-1β, nfkb, and tnf-α genes, which play an important role in the host innate response, were down-regulated during p. brasiliensis-mh-s cell interaction in the presence of pulmonary surfactant or alexidine dihydrochloride compared to the control . in contrast, the main up-regulated genes were those encoding the membrane-related protein clec  <dig>  - a mannose-type receptor, important for more effective phagocytic capacity  <cit>  - and the pro-inflammatory inhibitor , presenting fold-changes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, in cultures exposed to the pulmonary surfactant .

nfkb is a key transcription factor involved in tlr-mediated innate immunity and together with its repressor nkrf is an important regulator of the inflammatory process, a powerful protective mechanism coordinated and controlled by cytokines and chemokines. our data showed an up-regulation of the nkrf gene in the presence of the pulmonary surfactant, suggesting a possible modulation of the innate immune response under conditions of increased plb activity.

cytokine production by mh-s cells during host-pathogen interaction
in order to verify the pattern of mh-s cell activation, the levels of the cytokines interleukin- <dig> , il- <dig>  and tumor necrosis factor-α  were determined. when compared to the control, the mh-s cells treated with alexidine produced higher levels of il- <dig> and tnf-α and lower levels of il- <dig>  however, no significant difference between the control group and the group treated with surfactant was observed .

in the course of experimental fungus infection, cell-mediated immunity is critical for host defense  <cit> . the successful resolution of p. brasiliensis infection depends on a strong th <dig> immune response and down-regulation of th <dig> cytokine production. the immune response involving a preferential th <dig> activation, with ifn-γ production and efficient macrophage activation, is able to control fungal dissemination. ifn-γ production is partly dependent on il- <dig> production in macrophages  <cit> .

our results demonstrated that the interaction between mh-s and yeast cells, in the presence of plb, is capable of shaping macrophage activation, compromising the induction of the th <dig> response and strongly suggesting a pathogen evasion mechanism.

based on these results, we propose the model presented in figure  <dig> to explain the phagocytic mechanism of the interaction between p. brasiliensis and mh-s cells. in the presence of the activator of plb activity , a stimulation of the mannose-receptor clec signal transduction pathway probably occurs, since expression of this gene is induced. the up-regulated clec- <dig> and nkrf and the down-regulated nfkb, tnf-α, and il-1β genes provide evidence that the mannose-receptor clec is the probable mediator of fungal phagocytosis. this is further supported by the increased adherence and internalization of yeast cells by mh-s cells in the presence of the surfactant. also, the trl <dig> and cd <dig> genes are down-regulated, reinforcing the hypothesis that phagocytosis is probably occurring via the clec mannose receptor. in contrast, in the presence of the inhibitor of plb - alexidine dihydrochloride -, the clec <dig> and nkrf genes are repressed, which also corroborates this hypothesis. furthermore, adhesion and internalization are stimulated and, consequently, a gene expression re-programming occurs regarding the genes involved in the survival of the pathogen inside the mh-s cells.

fungal plb exhibits a function related to the regulation of immune responses via the liberation of fatty acid precursors  for host eicosanoid synthesis  <cit> . the production of eicosanoids, potent regulators of host immune responses, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes by fungi in the lungs, may also play a role in modulating the th1-th <dig> balance in the immune response, and may promote eosinophil recruitment or survival of the fungus in the lungs  <cit> . in-vivo and ex-vivo p. brasiliensis infection has been recently proven to induce leukotriene synthesis, which could explain the low levels of cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α, and confirm a pattern capable of interfering in the host response to the fungus  <cit> . thus, in the presence of surfactant there is increased activity of plb, and probably a greater release of substrates for lipid synthesis and production of leukotrienes, which act as suppressors of the innate immune response, confirming the low expression levels of the cytokine tnf-α and il-1β genes. in the proposed model, the genes related to phagocytosis and oxidative burst are up-regulated providing an efficient mechanism for fungal survival. the increase in il- <dig> and decrease in il- <dig> after inhibition of plb participate in the enhancement of ifn-γ activity, which is capable of inducing a cellular immune response. these data confirm the participation of plb in the mechanism of fungal evasion, interfering with an adequate immune response by the host.

CONCLUSIONS
based on these data, we conclude that p. brasiliensis plb is important for adhesion and internalization of yeast cells by mh-s cells. whether plb activity results from the production of eicosanoids or leukotrienes or not remains unknown, although studies are in progress to investigate this possibility. nevertheless, our study clearly identified activities of fungal plb that may enhance virulence and subsequent down-regulation of macrophage activation.
