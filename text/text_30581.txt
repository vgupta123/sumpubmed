BACKGROUND
while the beneficial effects of fruits and vegetables on human health are widely acknowledged due to a number of epidemiological  <cit>  and intervention studies  <cit> , the mechanisms behind such effects remain largely unknown. in the integrated european project, isafruit http://www.isafruit.org, we have set out to uncover effects of apple consumption on a number of biological parameters, as well as to reveal the underlying mechanisms causing these effects. apples were chosen as study object, since apples are among the types of fruits consumed in highest amounts throughout the european union.

one of the possible ways for apples and other foods to affect human health parameters is through alteration of the composition and activity of the intestinal microbiota. recent publications have revealed effects of vegetables and fruit products on the bacterial population of the gut  <cit> . large efforts are presently put into studies on the importance of the intestinal microbiota for health. a number of health related targets may be affected by the intestinal microbiota, including the immune system  <cit> , targets related to cancer prevention  <cit> , resistance to infections  <cit>  and obesity  <cit> . knowledge about the mechanisms involved in beneficial effects of apples may contribute to the design of novel prebiotic substances.

the main purpose of our study was to identify effects of consumption of apples or apple products on the microbial populations in the rat cecum. since the cultivable part of the fecal microbiota probably constitutes only 20-50% of the gut microbes  <cit> , it is important to explore effects on this complex ecosystem by use of molecular fingerprinting methods allowing representation of the non-cultivable bacterial species.

denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes have previously proved very useful for analysis of intestinal bacteria  <cit> . in the present investigation we have used this method for analysis of cecal 16s rrna fragments amplified with universal primers, targeting the whole bacterial community. quantitative real-time pcr was used in order to verify changes observed by dgge. additionally, we studied selected cecal parameters that could be influenced by a changed microbiota. these included measurements of short-chain fatty acids , which have potentially beneficial effects on gut health, as well as of the potentially adverse enzymes synthesized by colonic bacteria, β-glucosidase  and β-glucuronidase .

RESULTS
effect of long-term apple consumption on the rat cecal environment 
consumption of  <dig> g apples a day for a period of  <dig> weeks had no effect on cecal ph, relative cecal weight, or production of scfa . apple consumption led to a small increase  in the activity of cecal β-glucuronidase  from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/g cecal content in  <dig> control animals to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/g in  <dig> animals fed with  <dig> g apples per day  and an increase in beta-glucosidase  from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/g cecal content . dmh treatment of  <dig> animals within each of the groups, ending  <dig> weeks before euthanization, had no effect on any of these observations.

principal component analysis  of dgge profiles containing 16s ribosomal genes amplified by universal bacterial primers revealed that apple consumption affected the composition of bacteria in cecal samples . however, it was not possible to explain this effect by occurrence of specific bands, and thus not possible to identify specific bacterial species affected by the apple diet.

effect of long-term consumption of apple purée, pomace, pectin, and juice on the rat cecal environment 
to clarify which of the components present in apples that caused the increase in enzymatic activity as well as the changes in cecal bacterial composition, a number of different apple components were tested for  <dig> weeks in seven groups of  <dig> initiated animals as described in materials and methods. no effect was observed of any of the components tested on cecal ph, cecal weight and gus activity of the rats . the level of cecal bgl activity was lower in the group fed whole apple purée compared to all other groups, including the control group . none of the components had any effect on the cecal concentrations of acetate and propionate. in the pomace and the  <dig> % pectin groups, there were significant increases in the concentration of butyrate from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g cecal content in the control group to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g in the rats fed pomace  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g in the rats fed pectin  .

comparison of dgge profiles containing 16s ribosomal genes amplified from cecal contents by universal bacterial primers showed no convincing difference between the control animals and animals fed with either apple purée, pomace, clear or cloudy juice . however, animals fed with either  <dig> % or  <dig> % pectin had a clear difference in their composition of cecal bacteria, which was illustrated by pca .

effect of short-term consumption of apple and apple pectin on the rat cecal environment 
to further elucidate the observed effects of whole apples and apple pectin, three groups of eight rats were fed with either control diet,  <dig> g apples a day or 7% pectin for a period of four weeks. there was no significant effect on cecal bgl activity of the rats, but a significant  increase in the activity of gus was observed from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/g cecal content in control animals to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/g in animals fed with pectin . in animals fed 7% pectin there was an increase  in the production of cecal butyrate, a decrease in cecal ph  and an increase in cecal weight relative to total animal weight . the apple fed rats also had a significant drop in cecal ph  and increase in butyrate , but no changes in gus or cecal weight .

in the short-term experiment, pca of the universal dgge profiles did not reveal an effect of apple consumption , as was observed in the long-term trial . however, a marked effect of pectin consumption was observed . sequencing of bands, which were present on the profiles from pectin-fed animals, but not on the control profiles revealed that these bands represented species belonging to the gram-negative genus of anaeroplasma, and the gram-positive genera anaerostipes and roseburia, respectively. similarly, it was found that bands present on the control profiles but absent on the profiles from pectin-fed rats represented gram-negative alistipes and parabacteroides sp .

quantitative real-time pcr was performed to verify the changes found by dgge. bacteroides 16s rrna gene content was significantly lower in both the pectin-fed group  and the apple-fed group  than in the control group . with control levels indexed at 100%, levels were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for the pectin and apple groups, respectively.

there was no statistical significant difference in lactobacillus 16s rrna gene content between the three groups , however there was a trend that more lactobacilli were present in the apple-fed group . likewise, there was no significant difference in bifidobacterium 16s rrna gene content between the three groups , but a clear trend indicated more bifidobacteria in the pectin-fed group than in the control group .

clostridium coccoides 16s rrna gene contents were significantly higher in the pectin-fed group  than measured in the control group and in the apple-fed group . contents of c. coccoides rrna genes in the pectin-fed rats relative to the control rats were  <dig>  ±  <dig> %.

finally, the amount of the butyryl-coenzyme a coa gene, involved in butyrate production, was significantly higher in the pectin group  than in the control group and the apple-fed group . levels relative to control were  <dig> ±  <dig> % for the pectin group.

discussion
this study showed for the first time that intake of whole apples affect the microbial population in the cecum of rats. effects were observed on the composition of the microbiota after  <dig> weeks as well as after  <dig> weeks. in the long-term feeding study the changes could be identified by pca of the gel patterns produced by dgge of pcr amplified 16s rrna genes. in the short-term study, pca did not reveal any major changes, however a statistically significant decrease in the bacteroides group was observed by qpcr. this indicates that even though short-term consumption introduced minor changes in the intestinal microbiota, long-term consumption was required for these changes to be substantial enough to be detected by the pca. the observation that long-term consumption of whole apples influenced the rat intestinal microbiota  is consistent with previous studies showing effects of extraction juices, rich in dietary fibers from apples, on gut microbes in rats  <cit> . in contrast to the extraction juices investigated by sembries and coworkers, the clear and cloudy apple juices applied in the present study contained only very low amounts of dietary fibers and had no effect on the gut microbiota detectable by the methods applied.

addition of either  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig> % of dry apple pectin to the diet caused overall changes in dgge profiles of the cecal microbiota, which for the 7% pectin group was shown to include an increase in species belonging to the gram-negative genus of anaeroplasma, and the gram-positive genera anaerostipes and roseburia, and a decrease in gram-negative alistipes and bacteroides spp . previous studies have demonstrated the ability of some bacteroides species to ferment pectin  <cit>  and shown an increase in the bacteroides population after feeding rats with pectin related products  <cit> . in vitro fermentation studies have showed an increase in bacteroides when low methylated pectin was used  <cit> , but other fermentation studies failed to show any effect on this group  <cit> . the discrepancies between the studies may be due to differences in pectin used and/or the fact that different bacteroides populations were studied.

quantitative real-time pcr  using a primer set constructed based on the sequenced bands from the dgge analysis  specified that three-fold less bacteroides spp were present in samples from pectin-fed rats than in the control. additionally, a more than four-fold increase in clostridium coccoides,  in the pectin-fed animals was showed . furthermore, samples from the pectin-fed animals contained four times as many genes encoding the butyryl-coenzyme a coa transferase as the control samples . this enzyme is known to be present in bacteria from the clostridium cluster xiva, in strains in the roseburia-eubacterium rectale cluster, and in faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which are known to be numerically important butyrate-producers in the human gut  <cit> .

one previous report showed a decrease in butyrate after feeding rats diet containing 5% pectin  <cit> , however other studies have shown an increase in butyrate concentration after incubation of fecal slurry with apple pectin  <cit> , or feeding apple pectin to weaning pigs  <cit> . in consistence with the observed increase in the clostridum cluster xiva, as well as with another previous report  <cit> , our study revealed a significantly higher amount of butyrate in the animals fed diet containing either  <dig> % or 7% pectin . butyrate is considered to be particularly beneficial to the gut mucosa because it induces apoptosis in cancer cell lines and functions as fuel for the enterocytes  <cit> .

our results strongly suggest that the observed changes in the microbiota of the apple-fed rats should be attributed mainly to the pectin present in the apples. this is not surprising, since pectin is probably the component of the whole apple most likely to escape digestion and reach the cecal environment. however, it should be noted that the content of pectin in the apples corresponds to only approximately  <dig> % in the diet, and we find it likely that also other components present in the apples contribute in concert to the observed effect on the microbiota. in support of this, it has been reported that apple pectin and a polyphenol-rich apple concentrate had more effect on cecal fermentations and lipid metabolism in rats when fed together than when fed separately  <cit> .

in the present study, we found a significant increase in gus enzyme activity in cecum of the 7% pectin-fed rats. this is surprising, since it contradicts a number of other reports showing that dietary pectin reduces gus activity in the intestinal environment  <cit> . however, in consistence with our observations, rowland and coworkers  <cit>  reported a significant increase of gus activity in rats after consumption of a diet containing 5% pectin, and bauer and coworkers  <cit>  reported a pectin-induced 10-fold increase in fecal gus activity in pectin-fed rats. additionally, dabek et al.  <cit>  reported that gus activity is preferentially found in members of the firmicutes phylum, whose populations were increased in the 7% pectin fed rats. gus is generally considered as a biomarker for colon cancer development, since it has the potential to activate liver glucuronated toxins and mutagens  <cit> . however, gus may in this way also activate beneficial compounds, such as liver glucuronated plant polyphenols  <cit> . thus, the interaction between dietary pectin, gus activity and colon carcinogenesis remains to be clarified.

CONCLUSIONS
the reduction of ph, potentially caused by the increased scfa production, and the increased cecal weight observed in the pectin-fed rats  indicate increased cecal fermentation, which is considered beneficial for gut health. the observed increase in butyrate, which is considered beneficial for gut health, correlated with an increase in the clostridia xvia cluster that harbors many butyrate producing species. the evidence thus suggests that apples have a health-promoting effect on the rat intestinal microbiota, and that this effect is mainly explained by the presence of pectin in the apples. however, there are lots of cautions to be taken when extrapolating data from animal experiments to humans, and it should be kept in mind that rats metabolize the ingested apple components differently from humans. the data presented here will at a later stage be interpreted in the context of other biological changes recorded during the course of the isafruit project, which includes also human intervention studies.
