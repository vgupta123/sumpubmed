BACKGROUND
cyclin-dependent kinases  belong to a large protein family with  <dig> members described so far in human cells including cdks1- <dig>  along with pctaire and pftaire kinases named after conserved domain sequences  <cit> . these kinases are essential for cell cycle progression, and also are involved in control of transcription, dna repair and post-mitotic cellular process  <cit> . generally, cdks1- <dig>  pctaire and pftaire have been linked to cell cycle regulation, and cdks <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to control of rna polymerase ii  transcription  <cit> . the functions of cdks <dig> and  <dig> have not been defined clearly, but recent research implicates them in coordination of transcription and rna-processing  <cit> .

among the most important and broadly studied roles of cdks in transcription is the reversible phosphorylation of the c-terminal domain  of the largest subunit  of rnap ii. the ctd consists of multiple repeats of an evolutionarily conserved heptapeptide with the consensus sequence tyr1-ser2-pro3-thr4-ser5-pro6-ser <dig>  <cit> . the number of repeats varies among different organisms, ranging from 26– <dig> in yeast to  <dig> in mammals  <cit>  with  <dig> repeats in yeast and  <dig> repeats in human cells required for viability  <cit> . both biochemical and genetic evidence places the ctd in a central position in the 'mrna factory,' where it functions as a platform for interactions with processing factors and other transcription-related proteins  <cit> . more than a passive scaffold, reversible phosphorylation of the ctd regulates the cycling of rnap ii between a hypophosphorylated  form, which is competent to enter the preinitiation complex, and a hyperphosphorylated  form capable of processive transcript elongation  <cit> . throughout this cycle the ctd binds essential transcription-related proteins that help to regulate gene expression, promote efficient elongation, and effectively couple transcription to pre-mrna processing  <cit> .

to date at least five of the cdks  have been shown to phosphorylate the ctd in vitro; they all have been referred to as 'ctd kinases'  <cit> . both cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> are found tightly associated with the pre-initiation complex and are involved in transcriptional regulation  <cit> . the cdk <dig> subunit of p-tefb  induces hyper-phosphorylation of the ctd and stimulates elongation. unlike cdks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which have demonstrated interactions with the ctd in vivo, cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> are primarily cell-cycle related kinases  <cit> . cdk <dig> has been characterized functionally only human and drosophila in mammals and its role in tat-dependent hiv- <dig> transcription is still unclear  <cit> . although phosphorylation of yeast rnap ii by cdk <dig>  can inhibit transcription in vitro, the role of the cdk <dig> in mrna synthesis in vivo is not, as yet, clearly understood. it has been proposed as a candidate for mitotic rnap ii inactivation by inhibition of cdk <dig> ctd-kinase activity  <cit> .

in animals and yeasts, interactions between the ctd and ctd-specific kinases have become a focal point of biochemical and genetic investigations of rnap ii transcription and transcription-linked mrna processing  <cit> . however, the ancestry and evolutionary relationships among ctd kinases have not been investigated thoroughly. evolutionary analyses of the rnap ii ctd show that canonical ctd heptads are strongly conserved only in a subset of eukaryotic groups. in evolutionary trees based on rpb <dig> sequences, all eukaryotic groups in which the ctd is strongly conserved appear to be descended from a single common ancestor   <cit> . the reasons for differential conservation of the ctd have not been clarified, nor have evolutionary correlations been established between strong conservation of ctd structure and the presence of essential ctd/protein interactions. in addition, although the functions of various cdks are reasonably well characterized in mammals and yeasts, very little is known for most other eukaryotes, and the overall evolution of cdks has been investigated only in animals and yeasts  <cit> . therefore, a comparative evolutionary study also can provide clues as to which cdk orthologs, and presumably cdk functions, are present over a broad range of eukaryotic diversity.

here we present a comparative genomic analysis of cdks, using complete genomes from members of the "ctd clade" , as well as from other diverse eukaryotic organisms lacking a canonical ctd , to explore the evolutionary relationships between the ctd and ctd kinases. we also provide a phylogenetic distribution of cdks from a wide range of organisms, suggesting new hypotheses regarding the emergence and evolution of different members of the cdk family.

RESULTS
we identified  <dig> cdk family members,  <dig> from animals, plants, yeasts, and four protists from which genome sequences have been completed, and  <dig> additional cdks from incomplete genome sequences of organisms with known ctd sequences . although all of sequences are included in our supplemental phylogenetic analysis , only  <dig> of them are included in the major phylogenetic analysis ; a large plant-specific amplification of cdk9-like kinases  and sequences from incomplete genomes are excluded . the nomenclature for kinases from arabidopsis followed joubès et al.  and vandepoele et al.   <cit>  . the catalytic core base, gly-rich motif and t-loop, required for characterized cdk function, appear to be conserved across all defined and putative kinase sequences analyzed . the 50% majority rule consensus tree of  <dig>  likelihood trees, sampled from the posterior probability distribution from bayesian phylogenetic inference, is shown in figure  <dig>  this tree provides strong support for grouping a number of previously uncharacterized cdks, from a variety of organisms, with defined cdks from animals and yeast. overall, however, very little support is found for relationships among different cdk orthologous groups.

note: the sequences in bold are the additional sequences from incomplete genomes and uncharacterized cdk <dig> like-kinases from arabidopsis and oryza included in supplemental phylogenetic tree .

in this unrooted tree the highly diversified cell-cycle kinases defined in humans, cdks1- <dig>  fall into a large cluster with 69% bayesian support. this grouping includes cdks from all organisms examined in the study. among these putative cell-cycle cdks, some plant and protistan kinases can be assigned with reasonable confidence to specific cdk groups. for example, apparent orthologs of human cdk <dig> are found in other animals , yeasts, both plants , encephalitozoon and giardia . likewise, putative orthologs of cdk <dig> were identified in all organisms examined, except for the two plants . a number of other sequences, such as tbcrk <dig> and  <dig> from trypanosoma, cluster with cell-cycle kinases but not clearly with any specific cdk family. significantly, and consistent with the results of liu and kipreos   <cit> , cdk <dig> and pctaire-like kinases from fungi and animals form a strongly supported group, indicating their close relationship .

in contrast to cell-cycle kinases, our phylogenetic results failed to identify a clear ortholog of any transcription-related cdks from two of the complete genomes examined, trypanosoma brucei and giardia lamblia. this includes strongly supported clades of presumed orthologs of human cdks7- <dig> respectively. a well-defined cdk <dig> family is recovered, including sequences from yeasts, the microsporidian, plants, and animals. these are the primary groups that make up the "ctd-clade," in which the rnap ii ctd is invariably conserved . cdk <dig> shows an interesting sister relationship to hsccrk from human and apparent orthologs from drosophila, caeorhabditis and arabidopsis. in arabidopsis, four possible cdk <dig> orthologs were found, as reported previously by shimotohno and colleagues   <cit> ; however, atcdkf  is quite divergent from the core cdk <dig> family and related specifically to hsccrk in our analyses. pfmrk from plasmodium, suggested previously to be a cdk <dig>  <cit> , does not fall within the well-defined cdk <dig> group, but clusters with another plasmodium kinase. the a priori hypothesis that pfmrk belongs in the core cdk <dig> group is strongly rejected with our data set in a likelihood paired-sites test.

likewise, glcaklike  has been proposed as a cdk <dig> from giardia, based on nearest sequence similarity to kin <dig> in a more limited comparison to cdk sequences from fission yeast  <cit> . in our expanded analyses of cdks from  <dig> completed genomes, we find no evidence supporting an orthologous relationship to cdk <dig> for this, or any giardia sequence. the a priori hypothesis that glcaklike belongs in the core cdk <dig> group also is strongly rejected in a likelihood paired-sites test.

a robust cdk <dig> family is recovered with strong support values in both distance bootstrap and bayesian inference. like cdk <dig>  this family includes putative orthologs only from members of the "ctd-clade," specifically yeasts, animals and plants. although the microsporidian encephalitozoon is a member of the rnap ii "ctd clade," tblastn searches of the complete genome of encephalitozoon found six cdks but none show a phylogenetic affinity to cdk <dig> 

a cdk <dig> grouping also is supported as monophyletic with representative cdks from yeasts, encephalitozoon, animals, plants and plasmodium. this group is divided into two well-defined sub-clades. one of them consists of bur <dig> from yeast along with cdk <dig> orthologs from animals; the other contains ctk <dig> from yeast, cdc2l <dig> and crkrs from human, and apparent orthologs from drosophila and caenorhabditis, both plants, and plasmodium. a putative cdk <dig> also is found in encephalitozoon, but falls at the base of the larger cdk <dig> grouping and does not associate clearly with either subgroup . plants also contain a large number of putative cdks that show strong phylogenetic affinity to cdk <dig> . these kinases appear to represent a plant-specific amplification of cdk <dig>  although their functions have not been determined experimentally.

human cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> group with apparent orthologs from other animals, plants, fission yeast, and pfcrk <dig> from plasmodium. once again, no kinases from either trypanosoma or giardia show any phylogenetic affinity to this group.

discussion
a suggestion of co-evolution between the rnap ii ctd and ctd kinases
at least five cdks have the capacity to phosphorylate rnap ii ctd repeats in vitro or in vivo  <cit> . kinases that appear to be related closely to cdk <dig>  which can phosphorylate the ctd in vitro, are present in all organisms sampled; however, it is not clear that cdk <dig> interacts with the ctd in vivo or is essential for ctd function. cdk <dig> was found only in human and drosophila and, based on our analyses from a diverse group of eukaryotes, appears to be derived from within a larger cdk <dig> family. in any case, according to its restricted phylogenetic distribution, possible ctd/cdk <dig> interactions cannot explain the conservation of ctd structure in diverse members of the "ctd-clade."

evolutionary investigations of rpb <dig> sequences show that canonical ctd heptads are conserved strongly in only a subset of eukaryotic groups, all apparently descended from a single common ancestor  <cit> . this "ctd-clade" is composed of animals, plants, fungi, and related protistan groups, including microsporidians, chytridiomycetes, choanoflagellates and slime molds . a handful of organisms that do not fall inside the "ctd-clade" do have tandemly repeated c-terminal heptads. for example, rpb <dig> from plasmodium falciparum contains a short set of seven tandem c-terminal repeats. based on codon usage and comparative alignment with sequences from other plasmodium species, these heptads are best explained by a recent tandem duplication of a single heptad motif in p. falciparum or its immediate ancestor  <cit> . no other apicomplexan rpb <dig> contains tandemly repeated heptads, nor does the nearest evolutionary relative of the apicomplexans . although vestigial or convergent heptad repeats are found in a few organisms scattered across the eukaryotic evolutionary tree, strong stabilizing selection on ctd structure appears to be restricted to those eukaryotic lineages found in the "ctd-clade" .

in our analyses of cdks, members of this "ctd-clade" are precisely the same eukaryotes to which clear orthologs of cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> are restricted. when sequences recovered from additional but incomplete eukaryotic genomes are included in phylogenetic analyses, distribution of these two kinases remains tightly correlated with strong conservation of canonical ctd repeats . moreover, unlike cdk <dig>  the primary characterized function of both of these kinases is to mediate rnap iia/iio cycling through reversible phosphorylation of ctd residues  <cit> .

taken together, these findings suggest that the rnap ii ctd has undergone a co-evolutionary process with cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  if phylogenetic results based on cdk and rpb <dig> sequences reflect evolutionary history, the inference of a "ctd-clade" in both sets of analyses suggests that cdk <dig> and  <dig> originated as part of a major shift in the mechanics of rnap ii transcription in the ancestor of the "ctd-clade"  <cit> . it was in that ancestor that reversible phosphorylation of the ctd became a central organizing principle for regulating the transcription cycle, and laid the foundation for more complicated mechanisms of transcriptional control in these organisms. such a profound shift in the mechanics of rnap ii transcription would explain why the ctd is conserved so strongly in members of the ctd-clade, but not in many other eukaryotic lineages  <cit> . in this scenario, other known or putative ctd kinases  originated before canalization of a ctd-based rnap ii transcription cycle, and were adapted later as ctd kinases.

it also is possible that the co-evolution inferred from comparisons of the phylogenetic distribution of rpb <dig> and cdks7/ <dig> does not reflect the pattern of evolutionary history but, instead, results from functional constraints driven by ctd/cdk interactions. both glcaklike from giardia and pfmrk from plasmodium have been suggested previously to be orthologs of cdk <dig>  <cit> ; these hypotheses are rejected strongly by our phylogenetic analyses. assuming these kinases really are cdk7s, then their failure to cluster with other orthologs must be due to phylogenetic artifacts, frequently referred to as "long-branch attraction"  <cit> , that can be common when rates of evolution vary dramatically among sequences. the large amounts of sequence divergence of pfmrk and glcaklike from other cdk7s, along with a complete degeneration of the ctd in giardia species and apicomplexans as a group, are unlikely to coincidental. it is possible that those organisms retaining a rnap ii transcription cycle mediated by cdk <dig> and  <dig> kinase activity form distinct clades, in both rpb <dig> and kinase derived trees, because both sets of proteins share parallel modes of evolution driven by their physical interactions. in this case, the observation of co-evolution between the ctd and ctd-directed kinases need not have a phylogenetic basis, only a functional one.

most putative cdks from giardia and trypanosoma, and several from plasmodium, do not associate strongly with any established cdk family. it is reasonable to assume that at least some of these kinases are orthologs of defined cdk groups, but have diverged to the point that they are not recognizable using sequence-based phylogenetic methods. although such a scenario may have disturbing implications for the use of these methods across broad evolutionary distances, particularly when functional interactions among sequences are unknown or poorly understood, it cannot be ruled out as an explanation for our observations. analyses of additional genomes from diverse eukaryotes are required, both to verify our observations of co-evolution between the ctd and ctd-directed kinases, and to determine its bases.

general evolutionary trends in the cdk family
kinases from protistan organisms
in an effort to understand the broader evolutionary history of cdks, three deep-branching protists with complete genomes, plasmodium falciparum, trypanosoma brucei and giardia lamblia, were included in our study. our blast searches detected  <dig> putative kinases from these protists; six from plasmodium falciparum, four from trypanosoma brucei and five from giardia lamblia . the phylogenetic positions and orthologous relationships of these kinases generally are not well defined by phylogenetic analyses . four of them , along with two microsporidian kinases  branched close to sccak <dig> and spcsk <dig>  cyclin-activating kinases from yeasts. all of these sequences are highly divergent, and it is difficult to determine, whether their branching positions are due to a phylogenetic artifact or a phylogenetic relationship. as noted above, glcaklike kinase has been proposed as a giardia cdk <dig> ortholog based on jtt distance data  <cit> , a relationship not supported by our broader phylogenetic analyses. moreover, there are no experimental data reported on the functions of any of these kinases. other putative protistan cdks, glcdc2l <dig>  pfmrk and pfpk <dig>  scatter among cdks from other organisms, but with no statistical confidence for any implied relationship. our most strongly supported results indicate that six of these kinases  belong to cell-cycle related kinase families cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  in particular, pfpk <dig> is well-supported as an ortholog of cdk <dig>  in addition, two kinases from plasmodium  appear to be transcription-related kinases, pfcrk <dig> groups with the cdk10/ <dig> family, and pfcrk <dig> with cdk <dig> 

the phylogenetic distribution of protistan kinases indicate that cell-cycle related kinases are present, or at least their functions are more strongly conserved , in a more diverse array of eukaryotes than are transcription-related kinases. this pattern also is seen in a more widely-sampled analyses including cdks from a number of organisms with incompletely sequenced genomes, including dictyostelium discoideum that has a canonical rnap ii ctd, and leishmania major, cryptosporidium parvum and entamoeba histolytica, which all lack a ctd . thus, the overall results suggest that cell-cycle related kinases are more ancient than transcription-related kinases, and probably ancestral to them, and that their core functions are more similar across the broad diversity of eukaryotic lineages. it will be interesting to see whether these preliminary hypotheses are supported as more genomes are sequenced completely, particularly from diverse protistan organisms.

cell-cycle related kinases
our analyses support well-defined groups for cell-cycle kinases cdk <dig>  cdk4/ <dig> and cdk <dig>  an ortholog of either cdk <dig> or cdk <dig> is found in all of the organisms in our study, and these two families appear to be closely related. tbcrk <dig> was proposed as a functional homolog of cdk <dig> in trypanosoma  <cit> ; here it groups among cell-cycle kinases, but is not specifically related to cdk <dig>  cdk4/ <dig> appears to be present only in human, drosophila and c. elegans. the cdk <dig> family has undergone expansion in metazoans, including pftaire and pctaire kinases, and putative orthologs of cdk <dig> are detected in plasmodium, trypanosoma and giardia. interestingly, no cdk from plants associates strongly with the cdk <dig> group, while the cdkb-type kinases, which are specific to plants, branch as sister to a broader cdk1/cdk <dig> clade. our overall results suggest that cell-cycle kinases have undergone extensive and independent evolutionary diversification in different eukaryotic lineages, and it may be difficult to classify many of them based on orthologous relationships in phylogenetic analyses. it may be that functional homologies, once established experimentally, will prove to be more consistent criteria for designating cdk groups.

the cdk <dig> family
clear orthologs of cdk <dig> from animals, plants, yeasts and microsporidian are strongly supported as a core family, with cdk-activating kinase from arabidopsis , and its apparent orthologs from animals, branching as a sister group. in addition to their role as ctd kinases, members of the cdk <dig> family in plants, animals and fission yeast can function as a cdk-activating kinase   <cit> . unlike animals and yeast, however, four cdk7-like of caks were isolated from arabidopsis  <cit> . atcdkf , which groups with human ccrk and apparent orthologs from drosophila and caenorhabiditis, exhibits only cak activity but no ctd kinase activity. consistent with the phylogenetic relationships recovered in our analysis, human ccrk and other animal orthologs were recently shown to have cak activity  <cit> . in contrast, atcdkd <dig>  and atcdkd <dig>  display both cak and ctd kinase activity and, along with a single cdk <dig> from rice, are included in a strongly supported cdk <dig> clade. interestingly, and despite its high sequence similarity to atcdkd <dig>  no kinase activity was reported from atcdkd <dig>   <cit> . apparently caks in arabidopsis have diversified substantially, and may be regulated in different ways from those in yeast, animals, and even rice.

sccak <dig> and spcsk <dig> from yeasts also have cak activity; however, despite their functional similarity to kinases in the ccrk group, they do not group with animal or plant caks . interestingly, in the single most likely tree recovered in our expanded bayesian analysis of  <dig> sequences, sccak <dig> and spcsk <dig> group with other caks in the sister clade to cdk <dig> ; however, there is no support for this placement in the bayesian probability distribution. sccak <dig> and spcsk <dig> sequences are highly divergent from all cdks, and the regulation of cak activity in yeast is very different from that of animals and plants  <cit> . thus, alternative lines of evidence may be required to determine whether there is any specific evolutionary relationship among all caks.

the cdk  <dig> family
cdk  <dig>  is a component of the multi-subunit mediator complex, which transduces signals from cis regulatory elements to rnap ii; it is proposed to inhibit transcription initiation by phosphorylation of the ctd. cdk8/srb <dig> and its partner cyclin c/srb <dig>  together with srb <dig> and srb <dig>  form a specific sub-module that is variably associated with the rnap ii holoenzyme, and potentially with the free mediator complex  <cit> . apparent orthologs of cdk <dig> form a well-defined group, including sequences from plants, animals and yeasts. interestingly, although a member of the ctd clade , no ortholog of cdk <dig> was identified from encephalitozoon. our further blast results  failed to identify any of the units of the cdk8/srb <dig>  sub-module in the microsporidia suggesting a loss of cdk8/srb <dig> unit from these highly reduced parasites.

although the cdk8/srb <dig> sub-module has been implicated in negative regulation of transcription by phosphorylation of tfiih, leading to the inhibition of the tfiih ctd kinase and transcription  <cit> , the exact mechanism still is unclear. recent research shows that the mediator containing this sub-module is isolated only in free form, not associated with rnap ii. in contrast, mediator lacking this sub-module associates with the polymerase  <cit> . there also is experimental evidence that negative mediator-rnap ii regulation by the srb8- <dig> sub-module is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans  <cit> . therefore, the absence of identifiable components of the srb8- <dig> sub-module in encephalitozoon suggests cdk8/srb <dig> function is absent from the microsporidia. the loss of cdk <dig> from microsporidia, along with absolute conservation of cdks <dig> and  <dig> in all members of the "ctd-clade"  implies that interactions between the ctd and mediator complex are less strongly entrained into essential rnap ii function, than are those regulated by tfiih and p-tefb kinase activity.

the cdk  <dig> family
cdk <dig> is a component of the p-tefb complex, which is a positive-acting rnap ii transcription elongation factor  <cit> . research has focused on p-tefb from animals and budding yeast. a definitive yeast homolog of animal p-tefb has not yet been determined from functional studies, but two candidates have emerged: the bur <dig> complex and the ctdk-i complex  <cit> . based on our blast and phylogenetic analyses, bur <dig> and ctk <dig>  are found in two distinct but related kinase groups, each with orthologs from other eukaryotes. bur <dig> is identified as the specific ortholog of cdk <dig> from metazoans, budding yeast and probably the microsporidia.

unexpectedly, the cdc2-like <dig> kinases and crkrs from animals are highly supported as orthologs of ctk <dig> from yeasts. although their functions are not yet clear  <cit> , our results suggest that human cdc2-like <dig> kinases and crkrs have cdk <dig> function. recent analyses of crkrs  suggest that it has ctd kinase activity and helps to link transcription directly to intron splicing  <cit> . this ctk <dig> clade also contains putative cdk <dig>  kinases from plants and as well as a cdc2-like kinase from plasmodium . the latter is the only apparent ortholog of a ctd-directed kinase  identified in our analyses from any organism outside the "ctd-clade." it remains to be determined whether pfcrk <dig> possesses the p-tefb function of ctk <dig>  since it is the only protistan sequence present in either cdk <dig> sub-group, and the rnap ii ctd has not been conserved in apicomplexans or their closest relatives .

in addition to the two previously identified copies of cdk <dig>  from arabidopsis, and one from oryza   <cit> , our blast searches also retrieved a large group of cdk9-like sequences  . these kinases are annotated as "cdc2-like" in databases and some of them also were identified in previous analyses of cdk evolution  <cit> . with one exception , all of these kinases group in a single cluster, with 100% support, and as sister to previously identified cdk9s of arabidopsis and oryza . os <dig> h <dig>   from oryza is extremely similar to oscdkc <dig> and very likely a second copy of cdkc  from oryza. there is no evidence of biological functions for these kinases as yet, but our results indicate that they are part of a large cdk <dig> complex specific to plants.

the cdk10/ <dig> family
in this group, orthologs of cdk <dig> are found only in human and drosophila, while cdk <dig> occurs in human, drosophila and caenorhabditis. three putative cdk <dig> orthologs were found in plants . cdk <dig> has been implicated in the regulation of the g2/m phase of the cell cycle  <cit> , but a cyclin partner has yet to be defined. only one protein associated with cdk <dig>  ets <dig> transcription factor, has been identified so far, suggesting a link to transcription  <cit> . cdk <dig> associates with cyclin l as a partner, and is a proposed component of a signaling pathway that helps to coordinate transcription and rna-processing events  <cit> . the close relationship between the cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> may reflect evolutionary and/or mechanistic similarities, but neither kinase family has been well characterized functionally. in addition, bc18h <dig> from s. pombe and pfcrk <dig> from plasmodium show close relationships to the cdk10/ <dig> family, but no function has yet been determined for these kinases either.

CONCLUSIONS
the apparent co-evolution between the ctd and certain ctd-specific kinases suggests an explanation for strong stabilizing selection on ctd structure in some eukaryotes, and its complete degeneration in others. based on the genomes examined in this study, either the origins of cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> in an unknown ancestor of the "ctd-clade," or the canalization of reversible phosphorylation of the ctd in some eukaryotic groups but not others, could account for the variation seen in rpb <dig> c-terminal structure. in either case, once thoroughly "locked" into rnap ii function, the ctd must have recruited other transcription and processing related proteins into a growing machinery of the "transcriptosome"  <cit> . our results suggest that was the case for several cdks that clearly predate the canalization of ctd-based rnap ii transcription; further genomic analyses are underway to look for other protein-protein interactions that could be responsible for strong evolutionary conservation of the ctd in members of the "ctd-clade."

this work also provides a new perspective on the overall evolution cdks and evolutionary relationships among kinase families. our combined genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that transcription-related kinases originated later than cell cycle-related cdks. finally, our results point to potential functions for a variety of previously uncharacterized kinases, based on their apparent orthologous relationships to defined cdks. additional completed genomes, particularly those from broadly diverse protists , will be critical to address these questions further. such comparative analyses will be invaluable in helping to guide experimental studies, which ultimately are required to verify the functional properties of each putative cdk.
