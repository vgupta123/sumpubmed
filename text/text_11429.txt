BACKGROUND
members of the species agrobacterium tumefaciens are plant pathogens, inducing the formation of tumors mostly at the crown of dicotyledonous plant species. the main pathogenic element of the bacteria is the tumor-inducing  plasmid, a fragment of which, the t-dna, is transferred from the bacteria to the plant cell upon infection . the expression of t-dna genes in the plant leads to the formation of the tumor and to the synthesis, by the tumor cells, of specific molecules, the opines. opines are instrumental in the ecological niche constituted by the tumor  <cit> . first, they are used as growth substrates by the tumor-inducing agrobacterium strains via the products of genes located on the ti plasmid. second, some of them also induce the conjugative transfer of the ti plasmid .

in the a. tumefaciens reference strain c <dig> , the genome consists of two chromosomes, a circular one  and a linear one , plus an at plasmid  and a ti plasmid . this latter plasmid bears most of the genetic determinants involved in the induction of plant tumors that are characterized by the presence of opines of the nopaline and agrocinopine families. nopaline is an arginine derivative while the agrocinopines  are arabinose phosphate derivatives . these last two opines induce the conjugative transfer of the c <dig> ti plasmid in conjunction with a quorum sensing  regulatory pathway  . in bacteria, qs couples gene expression with bacterial cell concentration. it involves the production and sensing, by members of a bacterial population, of diffusible signals, the concentration of which mimics that of the bacterial cells. once a threshold cell density is reached , the concentration of the signals permits their perception and the subsequent activation or repression of the transcription of qs-regulated genes . in a. tumefaciens, the qs signal molecule that controls the conjugative transfer of the ti plasmid belongs to the most common signal class in proteobacteria, i.e. the n-acyl homoserine lactone  class; it is n--l-homoserine lactone . ahls are generally synthesized by the prodcucts of luxi and luxi-like genes .

in strain c <dig>  the genetic determinants involved in the conjugative transfer of ti plasmid are induced by the agrocinopines, which bind the accr regulator encoded by the accr gene . this releases the repression of transcription of the accabcdefg operon encoding the transport and degradation of the agrocinopines a and b. bound to agrocinopines, the accr regulator also derepresses the expression of the arc operon. among the arc genes is trar, a member of the luxr family that encodes the qs regulator trar. this latter regulator binds the qs signal molecule 3o,c8-hsl, dimerizes, and activates the transcription of the tra and trb operons involved in the conjugative transfer of the ti plasmid, and to a lesser extent that of the rep operon involved in the replication of the ti plasmid  <cit>  . this complex regulatory system implies that c <dig> ti plasmid conjugation can only occur at high donor cell density and in agrocinopine-rich environments, allowing the efficient dissemination of the main pathogenic element of the bacteria in tumors.

in contrast with the wealth of data dealing with the ti plasmid, little is known about the at plasmid in spite of the fact that it is often found in natural isolates of agrobacterium spp. and can represent up to ca. 10 % of the bacterial genome. the at plasmid can sustain some large deletions  that are associated with a significantly reduced carrying cost to the cell  <cit> . known functions of this plasmid are scarce. one is the utilization of gamma-butyrolactone and gamma hydroxy-butyrate via the products of the blcabc  operon  <cit> . the last gene of this operon, blcc  encodes the lactonase that hydrolyses gamma butyrolactone, as well as numerous qs signal molecules of the ahl class  <cit> . the at plasmid also harbor genes involved in the degradation of amadori compounds such as deoxyfructosyl-glutamate and deoxyfructosyl-glutamine, that are commonly found in decaying plant material  <cit> . at plasmids are also conjugative plasmids. sequence analyses of the c <dig> genome have revealed the occurrence of a type  <dig> secretion system , termed avhb, on patc <dig> that is highly similar to the virb system of bartonella henselae  <cit> . the patc <dig> t4ss  also shares some common traits with two previously identified t4ss of agrobacterium, i.e. the one encoded by the virulence  genes of the ti plasmid  and the one encoded by the trb genes . interestingly, a recent study revealed that also the t4sspat of strain c <dig> is regulated by the master regulator accr encoded by the ti plasmid accr gene  <cit> , a feature that favors the co-transfer of both agrobacterium megaplasmids in the agrocinopine-rich environment of the tumor.

agrobacterium strain p <dig> was previously isolated from a plant rhizosphere  <cit> . this strain exhibited the capacity to synthesize a qs signal of the ahl class. strain p <dig> is non-pathogenic and in agreement with this, no ti plasmid was observed following the complete sequencing of its genome  <cit> . we report here the structure of the ahl produced by p <dig>  we investigated the possibility that this ahl is indeed a qs signal and we identified the relevant determinants in qs. moreover, we report the occurrence of a qs regulation of the expression of the t4sspat in strain p <dig>

identification, extraction and determination of the structure of acyl-homoserine lactones
preliminary tests to evaluate the production of ahls were performed essentially as described earlier  <cit> . aliquots of overnight culture supernatants, or  <dig> fold concentrated ethyl acetate extracts of culture supernatants of the assayed strains, were spotted onto tlc silica plate . both chromobacterium violaceum strain cvo <dig>  <cit>  and agrobacterium strain nt <dig>  <cit>  were used as bio-indicators. when necessary, tlc plates were first submitted to chromatography in a methanol/water solvent system .

for the determination of the structure of ahl, 500 ml of lbm medium inoculated with the p <dig> strain were centrifuged  and the supernatant serially filtered on  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm ultrafilters under vacuum. the filtered supernatant was extracted with ethyl acetate . ethyl acetate was rotary evaporated to dryness at 30 °c, and the extract resuspended in 100 % acetonitrile prior to uplc ms/ms analysis. uplc ms/ms was performed on a waters aquity uplc-tqd apparatus driven by a masslynx  <dig>  software, and fitted with an acquity hss c <dig> column . the temperature was set at 20 °c and the solvent flow at  <dig>  ml/min. the solvent composition is provided in additional file  <dig>  mass spectrometry was performed by electrospay ionization. the triple quadrupole analyzer was used in both ms and ms/ms modes with a m/z mass ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  the most sensitive analytical conditions were first determined using synthetic n--l-homoserine lactone  and 3o,c8-hsl. synthetic n--homoserine lactone  was used as a standard in uplc ms/ms analyses.

gene sequence analyses
identification of orfs, determination of gene organization and comparative genomic analyses of plasmids and chromosomal regions were performed at the ncbi web site , microscope plateform  and inra agmial  <cit>  plateform . in this latter case, the artemis program was used. sequence comparisons were performed using blast tools  with default parameters. blast analyses were achieved on both the non-redundant nucleotide sequence collection  and whole-genome shotgun contigs  databases. prediction of functional domains was achieved using interpro  <cit> . protein sequences were aligned using clustalw  <cit> . phylogenetic trees based on protein sequence analysis were constructed using the neighbor-joining method implemented in mega program version  <dig>  <cit> . bootstrapping was performed with  <dig>  replicates to assess confidence on the nodes.

cloning and mutagenesis
plasmid extractions were performed with the qiaprep® spin miniprep kit . restriction enzymes, t <dig> dna ligase , and t <dig> dna polymerase  were used according to manufacturer’s recommendations. pcr assays were performed in a final volume of 25 μl containing  <dig> x dna polymerase buffer , dntps  <dig>  mm, mgcl <dig> 2 mm, primers  1 μm each, dna polymerase  <dig>  unit, and 1 μl of boiled bacterial suspensions. pcr conditions were 5 min at 94 °c, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °c,  <dig>  min at 58 °c, and 2 min at 94 °c, and a final 10 min incubation at 75 °c phase.table  <dig> pcr primers used in this study

to mutagenize cini, the gm cassette from plasmid p34s-gm  <cit>  was inserted at the unique xbai restriction site of a pgem®-t easy vector  harboring a ca. 800 bp region of the cini gene obtained by pcr amplification . the same cassette was also inserted at the unique sphi restriction site found in a 1240 bp non-coding region of plasmid at , previously amplified and cloned into pgem®-t easy. the resulting plasmids, which are not replicative in agrobacterium, were electroporated  into p <dig> and p4rif strains. double crossing-overs that led to a marker exchange were identified by carbenicillin sensivity and gentamicin resistance assays and verified by pcr using the appropriate primers. the cini mutants and the pat non-coding control mutant were named p4cini and p4rifcini  and p4rifnc, respectively.

another mutant harboring a deletion in the region cinr cini cinx was generated by homologous recombination of a dna fragment that consisted of a gm-cassette surrounded by 375 bp of the 3′ end of the cinr gene and 336 bp of the 5′ end of the cinx gene . this dna fragment was synthesized and cloned into the pma-t vector at the unique sfii restriction site by the provider . the resulting plasmid which is not replicative in agrobacterium was electroporated  into the p4rif strain. double crossing-overs that led to a marker exchange were identified by carbenicillin sensitivity and gentamicin resistance assays and verified by pcr using appropriate primers. this mutant was named p4rifrix.

transcriptomic and rt-pcr analyses
overnight cultures of a. tumefaciens strains p <dig> and p4cini were diluted to an od600nm =  <dig>  in 50 ml ab mannitol. cells were grown at 28 °c up to an od600nm =  <dig>  and harvested by centrifugation . rna was extracted using the nucleospin rna ii kit  and further treated using rnase-free dnase  according to manufacturer’s instructions to ensure the absence of any contaminating dna. rna concentration and purity were assessed using a nanodrop nd- <dig>  rna samples were used in transcriptomics, rt-pcr and rt-qpcr experiments.

for transcriptomic analyses , rna quality was re-evaluated on an agilent bioanalyzer  <dig>  using an rna  <dig> pico kit . total mrna were purified from 1 μg total rna using ribo-zero rrna  removal kit , according to the manufacturer recommendations. directionnal rna-seq libraries were constructed using scriptseq v <dig> rna-seq library preparation kit , according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . library quality was assessed on an agilent bioanalyzer  <dig>  using an agilent high sensitivity dna kit. libraries were sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> instrument, with a truseq sr cluster kit v3-cbot-hs  and a truseq sbs v3-hs - 50 cycles kit , using a single read 50 bp recipe. libraries were pooled in equimolar proportions and diluted to a final concentration of 12pm, according to illumina recommandations. the generated data were demultiplexed by the high throughput sequencing platform of the institute for integrative biology of the cell  using casava software suite . the quality of the data was checked with the software fastqc  <dig> . <dig> from babraham bioinformatics, cambridge, uk). the illumina 3′-adapter was trimmed using cutadapt- <dig> . <dig> , and only reads with a minimal length of  <dig> nucleotides were kept. after the trimming step, the data were mapped using tophat <dig>  with a seed length of  <dig>  to the appropriate reference genome of p <dig> . only unique reads were analyzed. bam output files were sorted with samtools . htseq-count  was used to evaluate the number of reads by gene or by cds. the deseq package  <cit>  was used to analyze the differential expression of genes between the reference strain p <dig> and the cini mutant.

standard rt reactions were performed with 1 μg total rna obtained as indicated above, using random hexamers as primers and the revert aid tm hm inis first strand cdna synthesis kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. rt-qpcrs were performed in a lightcycler®  <dig> ii  apparatus. the data were processed using the 2-ΔΔct method. for all primer sets , the similarities of amplification efficiencies were controlled. the expression of the following  <dig> patp <dig> genes was investigated: avhb <dig>  avhb <dig>  traa, trag, cinr, cini, cinx, and agrotu_ <dig>  the internal control used was the regulator gene blcr , also located on the at plasmid.

measurement of bacterial doubling time
strains p4rif and p4rifcini were cultivated at 28 °c during 40 h in ab mannitol and ab glucose and in the rich media lbm and ty. for each condition, five independent repeats were set up per strain. bacterial growth was estimated by measuring the od600nm every 30 min using a biosreen c microplate reader and according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . generation times were calculated based on the od600nm from graphical plots of the growth curves. the experiment was repeated  <dig> times.

conjugation assays
conjugation assays were performed under in vitro conditions. overnight cultures in lbm of donor and recipient cells were mixed at an equal cell density . twenty μl of the mix were subcultured into 180 μl of ab mannitol and incubated in microplates at 28 °c for  <dig> to 96 h with no shaking, if necessary in the presence of  <dig> nm ahl. dilutions of these mixed cultures were spotted onto lbm agar media supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics to enumerate the different bacterial populations, i.e the donor, recipient, and at plasmid transconjugants. the verification of the presence of the at plasmid in a subset of randomly picked, putative transconjugants was performed by pcr with appropriate primers . for each experiment, at least  <dig> independent repeat assays were performed, and the conjugation frequencies expressed per recipient cells.

plant colonization under bacterial competition assays
tomato plants  were grown in a greenhouse under long day conditions , controlled temperature , in an unsterilized horticultural soil and daily watered with unsterilized tap water. at the zero time point, the pots containing three-week old plants were soaked with the bacterial suspensions  until the maximum water retention capacity of the soils was reached. nine plants were inoculated with the bacteria mixture and  <dig> samples consisting of 10 g of rhizospheric soil  were obtained at each time point, i.e. 1 day post inoculation ,  <dig> dpi, and  <dig> dpi. the soil samples were resuspended in 30 ml sterile nacl  <dig>  % and vigorously vortexed for 30 s. dilutions of these suspensions were plated onto ab mannitol agar supplemented with rifampicin and gentamicin to enumerate cfu after a 2 day incubation. pcr amplifications were performed using the appropriate primers  to discriminate strain p4rifnc from p4rifrix on a subset of  <dig> randomly picked, enumerated colonies per time point.

RESULTS
agrobacterium strain p <dig> produced n--homoserine lactone  but not 3o,c8-hsl
strain p <dig> was identified as one of the environmental strains that activates a beta-galactosidase activity in a. tumefaciens strain nt <dig>  <cit> , a qs bioindicator that responds to long chain ahls  <cit> . the production of short chain ahls was assessed using the c. violaceum bio-indicator strain cvo <dig> and found to be undetectable. ethyl acetate supernatant extracts were obtained from spent culture media of strain p <dig> and analyzed by tlc using synthetic ahl migration standards and the above mentioned bio-indicator nt <dig>  strain p <dig> produced a single ahl molecule spot as judged from the tlc plate, the rf and shape of which suggested that it might be n--homoserine lactone . the presence, in the ethyl acetate extract of the only 3oh,c8-hsl signal molecule, that is not the common signal detected in other agrobacterium strains  <cit> , was confirmed  using ultra-performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometer  analysis.fig.  <dig> identification of n--homoserine lactone  in culture supernatants of strain p <dig>  an ethyl acetate extract of a spend culture supernatant was concentrated, resuspended in 100 % acetonitrile and analyzed by uplc ms/ms. panel a: elution profile of synthetic 3oh,c8-hsl. panel b: mass spectra of synthetic 3oh,c8-hsl. the m/z values  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> correspond to the protonated forms of 3oh,c8-hsl , the dehydrated 3oh,c8-hsl  and the characteristic amine substituted lactone cycle , respectively. panel c: elution profile of the concentrated culture supernatant of strain p <dig>  the major peak migrates as the one of synthetic 3oh,c8-hsl. panel d: mass spectrum of the major peak observed in the concentrated culture supernatant of strain p <dig>  the m/z values and species are identical to those observed for synthetic 3oh,c8-hsl



strain p <dig> displayed a functional luxi-like gene  bordered by two luxr-like genes 
blast analysis of the genome of strain p <dig> revealed the occurrence of a single luxi-like gene that exhibited a 783 bp orf and encoded a deduced  <dig>  kda protein. this protein consisted of  <dig> amino acids. the p <dig> luxi-like gene, that we termed cini , was pcr-amplified, cloned into pgem®-t easy and the production of ahl by the resulting strain was evaluated. the presence of the cloned cini gene in e. coli conferred the ability to produce 3oh,c8-hsl.

the proteins most related to the p <dig> luxi-like protein were other deduced luxi proteins from four agrobacterium strains, namely a. tumefaciens strains 5a, rv <dig>  and ncppb  <dig>  and a. radiobacter strain dsm  <dig> . the p <dig> cini protein was also related to the trai protein of agrobacterium strain c <dig> . outside the agrobacterium genus, the closest deduced protein was cini from rhizobium leguminosarum , hence the name cini for the p <dig> luxi homologue. it is located on the at plasmid of strain p <dig> at coordinates  <dig>  <dig> to  <dig>  <dig> fig.  <dig> genetic determinants of the quorum sensing regulation on patp <dig> and related regions of other plasmids. panel a: genetic organization of the cini region on the pat plasmid of a. tumefaciens strains p <dig> and 5a, a. radiobacter dsm  <dig> and in the genome of r. leguminosarum strain  <dig>  gene sizes are drawn to scale . panel b: phylogenetic relatedness of the deduced cini protein of strain p <dig>  the tree has been constructed using the neighbor-joining method and bootstrap values calculated from  <dig>  re-samplings technique. panel c: phylogenetic relatedness of the deduced cinr and cinx proteins of strain p <dig>  the tree has been constructed as indicated above



the blast analysis was expanded to the right and left side of cini to search for other possible component of a qs regulatory system as their coding sequences are often located in the vicinity of luxi-like genes  <cit> . this analysis revealed the presence to the left and right regions of cini of two luxr-like determinants  that were termed cinr and cinx, respectively. the putative protein cinr  consisted of  <dig> amino acids, while the putative cinx protein  consisted of  <dig> amino acids. both cinr and cinx proteins exhibited the characteristic ahl-binding and dna-binding domains  <cit> . the proteins most related to the p <dig> cinr protein were again the deduced luxr proteins from a. radiobacter dsm  <dig> and a. tumefaciens 5a, rv <dig>  and ncppb  <dig>  outside the agrobacterium clade, the proteins most related to the p <dig> cinr protein were those from ochrobactrum rhizosphaerae sjy <dig> and rhizobium etli with which p <dig> cinr shared  <dig> and 54 % identity and  <dig> and 69 % similarity, respectively . the p <dig> cinr protein was also related to the trar protein of agrobacterium strain c <dig> . the proteins most related to cinx were the luxr-like proteins from the above mentioned agrobacterium strains and, outside this clade, cinr from sinorhizobium meliloti gvpv <dig> with which p <dig> cinx shared 39 % identity and 59 % similarity . cinr and cinx displayed only 29 % identity and 49 % similarity with each other and were therefore only distantly related.

the exact same organization of the cinr cini cinx region was found in data bases only in the four above mentioned agrobacterium strains . a related gene organization was observed in r. leguminosarum strain  <dig>  however in this later strain, cinx was absent and replaced by cins  <cit> .

transcriptome analysis revealed that cini regulated the expression of genes involved in the transfer of the at plasmid in strain p4
the identification of a luxi-like gene involved in the synthesis of an ahl molecule and the presence of luxr-like genes that encode proteins with characteristic ahl-binding and dna-binding domains on patp <dig>  are clear indications that they most likely constitute qs regulatory elements. to identify genes potentially regulated by these qs elements, a cini mutant was generated via the insertion of a gentamicin resistance cassette within cini by homologous recombination . the resulting strain, termed p4cini, lost the ability to produce any detectable ahl signal, as judged from the analyses of spent culture supernatant and ethyl acetate extracts.

rna was extracted from both p <dig> and p4cini strains during the exponential phase of growth, and used to perform transcriptome analyses. only fold changes above  <dig> with a p-value lower than  <dig> 10− <dig> were considered significant. using these parameters,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified , all of them being upregulated in p <dig> when compared to p4cini. most of the genes, i.e.  <dig> out of  <dig>  were located on the at plasmid of strain p <dig> . the remaining  <dig> genes were located on the circular  and linear  chromosomes. gene agrotu_ <dig> encodes a conserved hypothetical protein, agrotu_ <dig> a hypothetical protein, and agrotu_ <dig> a putative nucleotidyl transferase.fig.  <dig> comparison of three patp <dig> regions displaying upregulated genes. fold change of patp <dig> genes obtained from the transcriptome experiments are shown above each panel. upregulated genes of the patp <dig> are shown by arrows with different backgrounds while the non-regulated genes are shown by open arrows. gene sizes are drawn to scale . panel a: the avhb cluster of patp <dig> with genes upregulated or not. the avhb cluster of patp <dig> was aligned with the avhb cluster of patc <dig> and compared with the trb cluster of ptic <dig>  c <dig> genes displaying significant similarity to avhb genes are marked with the same background pattern as used for the corresponding avhb gene of patp <dig>  panel b: the tra cluster of patp <dig> with genes upregulated or not. the tra cluster of patp <dig> was aligned with tra cluster of patc <dig>  up regulated and non-regulated genes are represented as indicated above. panel c: the cinr cini cinx genomic region with upregulated genes of the patp <dig>  the cinr cini cinx genomic region was aligned with the corresponding pat region of a. radiobacter strain dsm  <dig> and compared to the one of r. leguminosarum bv. viciae strain  <dig>  up regulated and non-regulated genes are represented as indicated above



on patp <dig>  a first group of upregulated genes comprised the avhb genes plus the genes agrotu_ <dig>  agrotu_ <dig> and atse. this cluster was located between coordinates  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig> . it encompasses another gene, rcta, which did not appear to be differentially expressed in strains p <dig> and p4cini. the pat avhb genes of strain p <dig> were orthologs to those of patc <dig> that encode the t4sspat involved in the conjugative transfer of this plasmid  <cit> . agrotu_ <dig> encoded a partly deleted avhb <dig> gene. the two other genes, agrotu_ <dig> and atse, encoded a hypothetical protein and a hypothetical host attachment protein, respectively.

a second group of upregulated genes was located between coordinates  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig>  it comprised the traa, trac, trad, trag gene cluster, plus four neighboring genes, namely agrotu_ <dig>  agrotu_ <dig>  agrotu_ <dig> and riorf <dig> . the four tra genes of strain patp <dig> are orthologs to the tra genes of patc <dig>  these genes encode components of the dna transfer and replication  system that recognizes and cleaves at the origin of transfer  of plasmids  <cit> . the genes agrotu_ <dig>  agrotu_ <dig> and riorf <dig> encoded hypothetical proteins with no predicted functional domains, whereas agrotu_ <dig> encoded a putative plasmid stabilization protein. two other genes, namely hipa <dig> and hipb <dig>  located downstream of traa on patp <dig>  were orthologous to respectively atu <dig>  and atu <dig>  of patc <dig>  these genes were not overexpressed in p <dig> compared to p4cini.

the third group of upregulated genes was located between coordinates  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig> . remarkably, this group of genes encompassed cinr, cini and cinx, cini being the most upregulated gene within this set of three. the other genes, sus and msi <dig>  encoded hypothetical proteins, while agrotu_ <dig> encoded a hypothetical protein with a metal-dependent hydrolase domain and msi <dig> a phosphate regulatory protein.

the upregulation of a subset of  <dig> of the above mentioned patp <dig> genes  was confirmed in strains p <dig> and p4cini by rt-qpcr .

cini and 3oh,c8-hsl regulated the conjugative transfer of the pat in strain p4
the above data strongly support the view that cini and the associated 3oh,c8-hsl molecule controlled the conjugative transfer of the at plasmid of strain p <dig>  to validate this hypothesis, two p <dig> mutant strains were used as pat donor strains in conjugation experiments: p4rifcini that harbored a cini gene disrupted by a gentamicin resistance cassette and p4rifnc that harbored the same gentamicin resistance cassette inserted in a noncoding region of the at plasmid . conjugations were performed with strain c <dig>  as a recipient. the average pat transfer frequencies  were  <dig>  10− <dig> in the cross p4rifnc x c <dig>  and  <dig>  10− <dig> in the cross p4rifcini x c <dig> . these two values statistically differed . the transfer frequency of the at plasmid was therefore ca.  <dig> times higher for the strain carrying an intact cini gene than it was for the strain with a mutated cini gene. when  <dig> nm synthetic 3oh,c8-hsl were added in the media that supported the cross p4rifcini x c <dig> , the conjugation frequency was comparable to that observed in the cross p4rifnc x c <dig>  . these results unambiguously demonstrated that cini and the associated 3oh,c8-hsl signal control the transfer of the at plasmid in strain p <dig> fig.  <dig> pat conjugation efficiencies of strain p <dig> and related mutants. crosses involved the pat donor indicated on the x axis and strain c <dig>  as a recipient. conjugation frequencies  were expressed per recipient cells. a kruskal-wallis non parametric test and a post-hoc tukey test were used to evaluate whether the observed differences were significant  or not . results are shown by the letters displayed above the graph



the role of cinr and cinx was assessed using another mutant, p4rifrix that carried a deletion of the cinr cini cinx region replaced by the same gentamicin resistance cassette used to generate p4rifcini and p4rifnc . this mutant was used as a pat donor strains in conjugation experiments that involved strain c <dig>  as a recipient. crosses were performed either in the absence or in the presence of  <dig> nm synthetic 3oh,c8-hsl. the average pat transfer frequencies  were  <dig>  10− <dig> in the cross performed in the absence of the ahl, and  <dig>  10− <dig> in the cross performed in the presence of the ahl, two values that do not statistically differ from each other . these results indicated that either cinr or cinx, or both, are essential for the detection of the ahl signal molecule.

quorum sensing regulation of the conjugation of the at plasmid did not confer a selective advantage in tomato plant rhizosphere
to investigate whether the qs regulated transfer of the at plasmid may provide the host bacteria with a selective advantage, a series of experiments that involved various p <dig> mutant strains were performed. first, the consequences on bacterial growth of the mutation of the p <dig> gene cini was evaluated in vitro, by comparing the generation time of strain p4rif and p4rifcini. in ab mannitol, generation times were  <dig>  and  <dig>  h, respectively. in ab glucose, they were  <dig>  and  <dig>  h, in lbm  <dig>  and  <dig>  h, and in ty broth  <dig>  and  <dig>  h, respectively. these experiments were repeated  <dig> times independently and the differences observed for each culture media were not significant .

the relative fitness of strain p <dig> derivatives producing or not 3oh,c8-hsl was next evaluated in a competition experiment in a more ecologically-significant environment. to do so, and because p <dig> produces large amount of 3oh,c8hsl that can still be sensed by p4rifcini, we used the cinr cini cinx mutant described earlier. tomato rhizospheres were inoculated by agrobacterium strains p4rifrix and p4rifnc at equal cell density and the colonization of the root system assessed at various times by enumeration from soil suspensions of the inoculated bacteria on ab mannitol supplemented by rifampicin and gentamicin. the results  did not revealed any fitness differences of the two competing strains.fig.  <dig> fitness of p <dig> and the p <dig> cinr cini cinx mutant in the tomato rhizosphere. cell densities  of strains p4rifnc and p4rifrix inoculated simultaneously on tomato plants cultivated in an unsterilized horticultural soil were assessed by dilution and plating onto the appropriate media . panel a: cell density of both co-inoculated p4rifnc and p4rifrix. panel b: ratio of the cell densities of each strain. at each time point , the values generated by the  <dig> repeats were statistically analyzed by a mann and whitney non parametric test which indicated that the proportion of the cell densities of the two strains were not statistically different

this study led to the identification of the ahl molecule 3oh,c8-hsl produced by the avirulent agrobacterium strain p <dig>  the 3oh,c8-hsl signal is unusual among agrobacteria but has been described as a qs signal in other systems . in strain p <dig>  several elements indicate that a qs system controlled the conjugative transfer of patp <dig>  these are: , the production of 3oh,c8-hsl in p <dig> culture supernatants, a molecule that belongs to the ahl class of qs signals; , the presence of cini, a luxi ortholog in strain p <dig> involved in the synthesis of the 3oh,c8-hsl signal; , the occurrence of luxr orthologs that encoded proteins that possess characteristic ahl- and dna-binding domains; and,  the results of the transcriptome analysis and conjugation activities. indeed, from the differential transcriptome analysis of strains p <dig> and a p <dig> mutant unable to synthesize the signal molecule, it appears that the wild type p <dig> strain expressed sets of patp <dig> genes involved in the conjugative transfer of this plasmid at a much higher level than the mutant did. in support of this, the conjugation frequency of the at plasmid of strain p <dig> was ca.  <dig> times higher in the wild type strain than it was in the mutant. as a whole, this work is the first identification of the occurrence of qs regulation in the conjugation of an at plasmid in agrobacterium. a possibility exists, however, that a similar system has been identified, but not characterized, by other authors on a transmissible genetic element of agrobacterium  <cit> .

three sets of genes were upregulated in the wild type strain p <dig> . the first set encoded the t4sspat involved in the formation of the conjugation apparatus in the donor bacteria, also termed the mating pair formation  complex  <cit> . the genes and deduced proteins that encode or determine the t4sspat of strain p <dig> were highly related to those present on the at plasmid of strain c <dig>  t4ss are indeed widespread among bacteria, where they ensure the transfer of protein or nucleoprotein complexes outside the bacterial cell . this is the case of the t4ss of a. tumefaciens, known as the vir system, that promotes the transfer of a single strand copy of t-dna from the bacteria to the plant cell  <cit>   and that of several plasmid conjugation systems such as those of the above mentioned pat and pti in strain c <dig> .

the second set of upregulated genes encoded the dna transfer and replication  system, a protein complex also known as the relaxosome. the relaxosome recognizes and cleaves the nic site at the origin of transfer  of plasmids  <cit> . the orit of pat strain p <dig> has not been formally identified, but on patc <dig> the origin of transfer was previously located between the traa and trac genes  <cit> . considering the high relatedness of the sequences of traa, trac and their intergenic region, it is tempting to speculate that the orit of patp <dig> may be located also here. based on the similarity of the deduced protein sequences, patp <dig> traa, trac, trad might encode the relaxosome, while trag may encode the so-called coupling protein that bridges the relaxosome and its cognate t4ss  <cit> . in the rhizobiaceae, three dtr systems have been identified among all species. the types i and ii dtr systems are found to be encoded by autotransferable plasmids, and the type iii by mobilizable ones  <cit> . it has been proposed that class i dtr systems such as the one encoded by the ptic <dig> tra genes, are regulated by qs while class ii dtr sytems, including the one encoded by the patc <dig> tra genes, are regulated by an rcta repressor associated with an rctb anti-activator  <cit> . interestingly, the organization of the four tra genes of patp <dig> did not reveal the presence of traf and trab orthologs downstream of traa, a key feature of type i dtr systems. the absence of traf and trab orthologs on patp <dig> would therefore place the patp <dig> dtr system amongst type ii systems regulated by rcta, especially considering that a rcta ortholog, but no rctb ortholog, is present on patp <dig> . the present study however demonstrated that the patp <dig> type ii dtr system was regulated in a luxi/luxr dependent fashion. this finding therefore indicated that type ii dtr systems could also be regulated by qs, contrarily to what has been suggested earlier  <cit> . we propose that two subclasses of type ii dtr systems exist: a first one regulated by rcta and rctb , and a second by rcta and qs . in agreement with this, a similar situation  was found on the at plasmid of agrobacterium strain 5a  that could therefore also belong to the second class of type ii dtr systems.

in relation with the above, genes encoding components of a qs regulatory system have been detected on patp <dig> among those upregulated in the wild type p <dig> strain with respect to the mutant. the gene cluster structure is quite unusual, as it consisted of a single luxi-like gene surrounded by two luxr-like genes. this organization appears to be unique in the bacterial world, and found only in agrobacterium strains . interestingly, strains p <dig> and 5a belong to the same a. tumefaciens genomospecies  <dig> and have been isolated in different experiments performed with a soil of the same origin .

besides the molecular genetics of pat conjugation, the reported data tackled some ecological aspects of the phenomenon. a recent report indicated that the at plasmid confers a competitive advantage upon the host strain in the rhizosphere but exhibits a high cost under carbon-limiting conditions  <cit> . therefore, we investigated whether the ability to transfer the plasmid also favors or hampers bacterial growth in the rhizosphere environment. no fitness differences were observed under the experimental conditions we used between strains p4rifrix and p4rifnc . from the above, it is reasonable to conclude that the qs-regulation of the conjugative transfer of patp <dig> did not confer a selective advantage upon the plasmid host in the tomato rhizosphere, at least under our experimental conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study led to the identification of novel conjugation system in which qs regulates plasmid transfer. however, contrary to what is observed for the conjugation of the ti plasmid, the qs regulation of pat transfer was not stringent , a feature that suggests that additional regulatory components may exist. the ecological and evolutionary relevance of the qs control of plasmid conjugation is still open to debate  <cit> . although such a regulatory process might be necessary to prevent a futile mobilization of the donor metabolic resources required for the conjugative transfer of a replicon  when the donor population is low, qs regulation does not allow the donor to sense whether putative recipients are present. in relation to this, it has been suggested that qs regulation of plasmid conjugation may serve as a way to detect a presence of a biofilm rather than to evaluate a cell density  <cit> . this suggestion can be related to the diffusion sensing concept described by redfield  <cit> . both hypotheses propose that qs would permit the biological phenomenon, here the conjugative transfer of ti and at plasmids, to occur only or preferentially in confined environments. another report suggested that qs regulation of plasmid conjugation may be a way to switch the bacterial behavior from plasmid donor at high cell density to recipient at low cell density  <cit> . this elegant proposal is based on the existence of genes encoding a plasmid exclusion entry system that relies upon two trb proteins  encoded by the corresponding trb genes of ti plasmids. interestingly patp <dig>  as well as patc <dig>  do not harbor trbj and trbk orthologs. the ecological relevance of qs regulation of the patp <dig> conjugative transfer therefore remains, to some extent, unclear.

additional files
additional file 1: map of the genetic determinants involved in ti plasmid conjugation in agrobacterium strain c <dig>  the functions of operons or genetic regions are as follows: acc, agrocinopine catabolism; arc, agrocinopine regulation of conjugation; noc, nopaline catabolism; tra, conjugative transfer region a; trb conjugative transfer region b; vir, virulence. both the acc and arc operons are regulated by the repressor accr. in the presence of agrocinopines a and b or in an accr mutant, the acc and arc operons are expressed. the expression of the arc operon permits the production of the qs regulator trar. the production of the qs signal 3o,c8-hsl by the synthase trai leads to an accumulation of the signal until its concentration  is sufficient to activate trar and allow the expression of the qs-regulated operons traafbh, tracdg and trb, a phenomenon leading to an increasing production of 3o,c8-hsl and eventually to the transfer of the ti plasmid. the figure is reprinted from chan et al.  <cit>  with the kind authorization from the publisher.
