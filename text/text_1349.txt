BACKGROUND
the catecholaminergic neurons of the cns of vertebrates participate in a wide variety of tasks, including motor coordination, mood regulation, and cognitive function, among others. neurotransmitters catecholamines , namely dopamine , adrenaline , and noradrenaline , are neuroactive molecules that exert strong influence on vertebrates behavior  <cit>  and serve a variety of central and peripheral functions  <cit> .

embryological studies indicate that several extracellular signals, as hedgehog and fgf, are vital to define the development of the prosencephalic ca neurons  <cit> . the homeodomain transcription factor orthopedia , regulated by such signaling pathways  <cit> , is crucial in restricting the fate of multiple classes of secreting neurons in the neuroendocrine hypothalamus of vertebrates  <cit> . specifically, otp is required for the correct differentiation of the ca neurons positioned in the zebrafish posterior tuberculum  and hypothalamus  <cit> . despite all these evidences, the role of specific transcription factors leading to the proper differentiation of the hypothalamic ca neurons remains largely unclear  <cit> .

prox <dig> homeobox gene is the vertebrate homologous of prospero in drosophila melanogaster. during drosophila embryonic development, prospero is expressed in neuronal precursors and determines the neuronal/glial fate of sibling cells  <cit> . prospero/prox1's high level of homology pinpoints possible functional conservation through evolution, suggesting prox <dig> involvement in vertebrate cell fate determination. indeed, also during murine brain development, prox <dig> is expressed in most of the locations in which neurogenesis and glial formation occur during middle and late prenatal and postnatal stages, as the subventricular zone, several regions of the prethalamus and hypothalamus, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus  <cit> .

here, we demonstrated that, in zebrafish, prox <dig> is widely expressed in the developing cns, and one of its expression domains is located in the area corresponding to the ventral part of the pt and the adjacent hypothalamic district, the area hosting the cluster of ca neurons positive for otp <dig> expression  <cit> . moreover, we took advantage of the zebrafish animal model to investigate the in vivo influence of prox <dig> on hypothalamic ca neuronal development by means of morpholino- and mrna- loss and gain of function methodologies.

we provide evidence that prox <dig> is required for the development of hypothalamic neuronal progenitors into mature ca neurons.

RESULTS
homeobox genes are expressed in a temporal and spatial restricted manner and play crucial roles for cell type specification  <cit> . zebrafish prox <dig> is a divergent homeodomain transcription factor whose homologues in drosophila and mice regulate cell proliferation, fate determination and differentiation in cns and sensory tissues  <cit> . noteworthingly, during murine brain development, prox <dig> is also expressed in the hypothalamus  <cit> , where several ca neurons differentiate.

spatio-temporal expression of prox <dig> during embryogenesis
previously published immunostaining analysis of the prox <dig> expression pattern revealed that the gene is active in several zebrafish embryonic districts  <cit> . to explore the role of prox <dig> during zebrafish cns development, we first performed a more detailed characterization of prox <dig> expression during embryogenesis and in adult organs by means of rt-pcr . we detected the presence of prox <dig> transcript at all stages analyzed, including the zygote, indicating that prox <dig> is also maternally expressed . furthermore, we report prox <dig> expression in the adult brain, eyes, and in non-neuroectodermal territories  . the spatial and temporal distribution of prox <dig> transcripts was then examined by whole mount in situ hybridization , following standard protocols, with digoxigenin- and fluorescein-utp-labeled probes  <cit> . at all stages analyzed, from 1â€“ <dig> cell stage to  <dig> days post fertilization , zebrafish prox <dig> expression analysis confirms and improves previous immunostaining results  <cit> . from an evolutionary point of view, the striking resemblance of the prox <dig> expression pattern among vertebrates strongly suggests a conserved role for the gene during evolution. although rt-pcr revealed the presence of maternal and zygotic transcripts, prox <dig> mrna is first detectable through wish around the  <dig> somites  stage in the ectodermic region corresponding to the otic placode . at  <dig> s stage, prox <dig> is also expressed in the lens placode  and in the first formed somites . at  <dig> hours post fertilization , prox <dig> expression persists in the lens  and in the adaxial cells  that will later differentiate in slow muscle fibers  <cit> . moreover, two distinct bilateral prox <dig> signals appear on each side of the midline, at the rostral end of the neural tube, in a region corresponding to the hypothalamus . at the same stage, strong prox <dig> expression signals define the pituitary, the pretectal segment , and each hindbrain neuromeric segment , where prox <dig> expression is visible in segmentally arranged clusters of cells . additionally, prox <dig> signals are detectable in the liver and the posterior lateral line primordium  . starting from  <dig> hpf, further signals appear in the retina, pancreas , and in the cephalic ganglia . at  <dig> dpf, when the retinal's layers are fully differentiated, prox <dig> signal is detectable specifically in the inner nuclear layer, as previously shown in other vertebrates  <cit> , and in the pretectal nuclei . in this work, we focused our attention on prox <dig> role during zebrafish hypothalamic development.

prox <dig> is required for the development of a group of hypothalamic ca neurons
the determination of the neurotransmitter phenotype is an important aspect of neuronal differentiation. degeneration of substantia nigra da neurons in humans is a hallmark of parkinson's disease, and the malfunction of ca neurons in other brain regions is implicated in psychiatric disorders and neuroendocrine dysregulation  <cit> .

in zebrafish, a detailed characterization of the ca neurotransmitter pathway makes this organism a favorite model to address the ontogeny of the vertebrate neurosecretory system  <cit> . th-expressing ca neurons are primarily located in the anterior dorsal telencephalon and hypothalamus of the developing forebrain, with a few additional neurons present near the postoptic commissure and pretectum region  <cit> .  <dig> hpf embryos hybridized with prox <dig> mrna probe and immunostained with th antibody show that prox <dig> transcript is present in close proximity to the most caudal posterior tubercular and the adjacent hypothalamic th-expressing cells, with partial overlap of the two signals . to determine whether prox <dig> is required for ca neuron development, we knocked-down the protein level by injecting  <dig> ng/embryo of a specific atg-targeted morpholino oligonucleotide   <cit> . abrogation of prox <dig> function leads to a severe loss of neurons in the hypothalamic portion of the pt/hypothalamic ca cluster  . this defect is already evident at  <dig> hpf  and persists later during development, as shown by th immunostaining at  <dig> hpf . the overall architecture of the ventral diencephalon was not affected in prox <dig> mo injected embryos, as suggested by the normal expression of shh . therefore, we concluded that the decrease in the number of ca cells is not determined by an alteration in the patterning of the hypothalamus. we also analyzed the th expression levels in prox <dig> mo injected embryos by means of quantitative real time rt-pcr. the th specific mrna level was about five-fold decreased in prox <dig> mo injected embryos when compared to the th expression in control embryos injected with the standard control morpholino oligonucleotide  , confirming the immunohistochemical analysis reported above. to demonstrate that the reduction of th positive cells in the hypothalamus of the embryos is specifically caused by the mo-induced abrogation of prox <dig> function, we performed a rescue experiment by coinjecting the embryos with  <dig> ng/embryo of prox <dig> mo and  <dig> pg/embryo of prox <dig> mrna . 80% of the embryos at  <dig> hpf  rescued the normal phenotype and displayed a proper number of hypothalamic th-positive neurons . on the other hand, overexpression of prox <dig> alone does not lead to supernumerary ca neurons in the ventral diencephalon, nor determines ectopic ca neuron formation, confirming that prox <dig> functions are required for the proper development of the th phenotype in a subpopulation of hypothalamic neurons, but are not sufficient to determine the appearance of supernumerary or ectopic th-expressing cells. interestingly, prox <dig> overexpression induces a slight increase of th mrna levels, as detectable by means of quantitative real time rt-pcr only ; further investigations are necessary to elucidate this aspect that might reflect the ability of prox <dig> to directly modulate th expression in those few cells where the two genes are coexpressed.

in order to address whether prox <dig> is involved in neurogenesis processes, we analyzed the expression pattern of the proneural gene ngn <dig>  <cit> . ngn <dig> expression domains resulted unaffected in prox <dig> mo injected embryos, allowing us to conclude that loss of ca neurons in the hypothalamus of prox <dig> mo injected embryos is not caused by alteration in neurogenesis . moreover, in order to address this issue, we analyzed the development of other neurotransmitter-producing neurons. specifically, the neighboring serotonergic neurons appeared only slightly affected by prox <dig> ablation in comparison to the most relevant effects we observed in the ca population . however, our description of prox <dig> effects on ca neuron development cannot rule out its potential involvement in the differentiation or fate determination of other neuronal types.

prox <dig> functions are required for proper otp <dig> and th phenotypes in the hypothalamic area
to further investigate the roles of prox <dig> in the hypothalamic ca neurons development, we showed that prox <dig> is also able to influence the otp <dig>  phenotype in hypothalamic neurons. as previously reported by our group  <cit> , zebrafish otp <dig> contributes to the specification and differentiation of da diencephalic neurons in the pt and the hypothalamus. in search of possible relationships between prox <dig> and otp <dig> in determining the th phenotype, we performed a double wish that evidenced the coexpression of the two genes in the hypothalamus . we also demonstrated that some of these prox1/otp1-positive cells are also positive for th , supporting the hypothesis that the coexpression of the two genes influences the development of the final th phenotype. injection of the embryos with otp <dig> mo or otp <dig> mrna does not result in significant changes in prox <dig> expression pattern at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . on the other hand, a mo-mediated reduction of prox <dig> levels determines significant modifications in otp <dig> expression pattern in the hypothalamic area, while otp <dig> expression in the rhombomeres resulted unperturbed. specifically, the injection of prox <dig> mo causes the decrease of otp1-positive neurons in the hypothalamus at  <dig> hpf in comparison with embryos injected with the stdr mo . on the contrary, prox <dig> overexpression does not modify otp <dig> hypothalamic domains, nor determines otp <dig> ectopic expression . our findings indicate that prox <dig> is necessary, but not sufficient, to the proper otp <dig> phenotype in the hypothalamic area. interestingly, otp <dig> appearance in the hypothalamus  <cit>  precedes the onset of prox <dig> expression in this area, suggesting that prox <dig> is not involved in the activation of otp <dig> transcription. rather, prox <dig> activity might be vital to control the switch of the otp1-positive cells towards their final th fate. the hypothesis is supported by the evidence that prox <dig> mo and otp <dig> synthetic mrna coinjection did not restore the normal th phenotype . thus, lack of prox <dig> might impede further neuronal differentiation, causing apoptosis or cell misspecification, with consequent loss of otp <dig> and th expression. in order to discriminate between these two possibilities, we performed a tunel assay on prox <dig> mo injected embryos at  <dig> hpf  and at  <dig> hpf . the level of apoptosis is not increased by prox <dig> knock-down, suggesting that the lower number of otp1-positive hypothalamic neurons might be determined by misspecification events rather than apoptosis. interestingly, otp <dig> is expressed in those cells already switched towards a more differentiated state, such as early postmitotic da precursors, as well as newly specified and mature da cells  <cit> . thus, according to the wealth of literature data pinpointing prox <dig> as a key player in the passage from proliferation to differentiation  <cit> , prox <dig> in the hypothalamus might drive the cells towards differentiative processes, leading to the terminal th phenotype of those precursors committed to a ca phenotype by the expression of otp <dig> 

overexpression of prox <dig> and otp <dig> together leads to supernumerary ca neurons in the ventral diencephalon and th positive cells on the yolk surface
to verify whether prox <dig> and otp <dig> together have an impact on the ca phenotype in the hypothalamus, we coinjected their specific mrnas at a concentration of  <dig> and  <dig> pg/embryo, respectively, and stained the embryos for th at  <dig> hpf. as reported above, the injection of prox <dig> mrna alone did not increase the number of hypothalamic ca neurons, nor did single  <dig> pg/embryo otp <dig> mrna injection . comparable results were obtained injecting  <dig> pg/embryo of the gfp mrna as control . the most numerous class in the group of control embryos presented  <dig> ca hypothalamic neurons, and only  <dig> embryos presented more than  <dig> th hypothalamic positive cells. on the other hand, the most numerous class in the group of the overexpressed prox1/otp <dig> embryos  presented  <dig> ca neurons, and  <dig> embryos showed more than  <dig> th hypothalamic positive cells , pointing out the synergistic effect of the prox1/otp <dig> coexpression on the ca phenotype establishment. remarkably, we also evidenced that prox1/otp <dig> coinjection induces th positive cells on the yolk surface , while these ectopic cells were never observed in control  or single  injected embryos . noteworthy, in the cns, the overproduction of th positive cells induced by coinjection was detected in the hypothalamus, suggesting that prox <dig> and otp <dig> genes require additional factors, present in the ventral diencephalon, to induce the th phenotype. thus, we demonstrated that the coexpression of prox <dig> and otp <dig> determines a higher number of ca neurons in the hypothalamus and induces ectopic th positive cells in non-neuroectodermal regions.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we highlight for the first time the role of prox <dig> in the proper development of the ca neurons in the ventral diencephalon. moreover, we provide evidence of regulatory links between prox <dig> and otp <dig> genes in defining the terminal th phenotype in the hypothalamus. the identification of prox <dig> as a key component in the differentiation of hypothalamic ca neurons will help in clarifying the developmental bases of several human behavioral aspects as well as pathologies such as addictions and parkinson's disease.
