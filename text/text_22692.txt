BACKGROUND
human mesenchymal stem cells  are easy to isolate from bone marrow aspirates. in cell culture, they can be expanded as clones showing multilineage differentiation potential  <cit> . it is well known that human msc differentiate when cultured under appropriate conditions into adipocytes, osteoblasts or chondrocytes  <cit> .

human adipocyte development can be studied in vitro starting from msc cultures, which can be induced to follow the process of adipogenesis  <cit> . how to grow msc obtained from bone marrow aspirates and other tissues under adipogenic differentiation conditions  <cit>  is already well established. insulin is known to act through the insulin-like growth factor receptor  <dig>  dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid agonist is used to stimulate the glucocorticoid receptor pathway and methylisobutylxanthine, a camp-phosphodiesterase inhibitor, are used to raise the camp level and thus to stimulate the camp dependent protein kinase pathway. here, we exposed cultured msc to adipogenic conditions in order to examine their adipogenic differentiation potential by the observation of lipid droplets stained with oil red o.

in recent years, new cellular and molecular insights into adipogenesis have been obtained by combining msc as an in vitro model for adipogenic differentiation and new "omics" technologies as monitoring tools. transcriptomics in combination with bio-informatics were not only essential in providing a list of potential adipogenic key player genes, they also allowed for a preliminary global view on biological processes and molecular networks involved in adipogenesis  <cit> , whereas proteomics of adipogenically differentiated msc were important to verify transcriptomic data  <cit> . furthermore, epigenomic approaches have allowed deeper insight in the epigenetic programming of msc from human fat tissue  <cit> , and state-of-the-art microrna array technology revealed the influence of non-coding rna on msc adipogenesis  <cit> . in particular, mir-27a was found to be a negative regulator of adipogenesis via the suppression of pparg expression  <cit> .

during adipogenesis derived from msc, the gene expression profile represents a unique, albeit not totally deciphered, pattern of transcription factors, allowing for the differentially induced regulation of specific pre-adipogenic genes to form pre-adipocytes. these regulatory factors promote further downstream target gene expression, responsible for the formation of typical adipocytes. in vivo, adipose tissue consists of, for one half, classical adipocytes, in which growth and long-term change and storage of lipids and fatty acids can be observed. the other half is composed of pre-adipocytes and supporting cells such as fibroblasts, immune cells  or different blood cells  <cit> . it has been shown that adipocytes cannot grow and accumulate lipids without restriction: for example, after reaching a certain size they are forced to divide into two or more adipocytes. the two observed processes, called hypertrophy  and hyperplasia  are typical observations of adipose tissue expansion  <cit> . after initial expansion under standard culture conditions, cellular growth arrest of proliferating pre-adipocytes is stopped when reaching confluence. however, following the addition of a hormonal cocktail, the cells undergo further cell divisions. in most cases this phenomenon occurs before the terminal differentiation program starts, and development into mature adipocytes begins.

the overall goal of our study was to analyze the pattern of gene expression of human bone marrow msc differentiation into adipocytes during a defined time scale. we were particularly interested in differentially expressed transcription factors corresponding to biochemical pathways involved in the process of adipogenesis. therefore we report genome-wide gene expression profiling of three human msc lines on adipogenic differentiation at five different time points  in reference to normal human fat cell tissue. thereafter, the expression profiles of all cells were analyzed using the online sipagene database for affymetrix microarray expression data, which was set up for chip comparison experiments  <cit> . with this approach, it was possible to describe a specific pattern of gene expression during adipogenic differentiation of human msc and between these msc and native human fat tissue.

RESULTS
isolation, culture and surface marker presentation of human msc
human msc were isolated from bone marrow aspirates and expanded in standard culture media containing selected batches of fetal bovine serum and  <dig> ng/ml basic-fgf. cultures showed the typical fibroblast-like cell morphology of msc growing in a swirling pattern during primary culture  up to passage  <dig> . to verify cell identity, cells were routinely investigated using flow cytometry analysis. measurements revealed a uniformly negative cell population for the hematopoietic markers cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> , and positive for cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> .

osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic potential of msc
expanded msc were routinely tested for their multilineage potential by inducing these cells towards osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation. osteogenic differentiation could be demonstrated in the osteogenesis assay by staining for alkaline phosphatase  activity as well as by intense von kossa staining of a calcified bone matrix. on day  <dig>  induced cultures showed clear signs of enhanced ap activity  and also an increased secretion of mineralized bone matrix  compared to controls . high-density micromass culture for chondrogenesis resulted in the formation of cartilaginous extracellular matrix as demonstrated by alcian blue staining of cartilage glycosaminoglycans  and antibody staining of cartilage-specific collagen type ii . on day  <dig>  non-induced control cultures did not show chondrogenic characteristics . finally, before performing microarrays of adipogenic induced msc, these cells were tested for their adipogenic potential. lipid droplets were visible first after  <dig> to  <dig> days of growth in inducing media . number and size of the droplets increased over the cultivation time of  <dig> days . control cultures showed no lipid droplet formation . as demonstrated by oil red o staining of lipid droplets, the induced cultures showed an increased accumulation of cells with lipid droplets and the number and size of droplets per cell had strikingly increased . the adipocytic differentiation was monitored using flow cytometry with different markers  - see also methods. after  <dig> days, expression of the mesenchymal markers cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd49b, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd49f, cd120a and cd <dig> did not change or was reduced comparing to the beginning and only expression of cd140a had increased  <cit> .

differential gene expression profiling of human msc during adipogenesis
to investigate the adipogenic differentiation program of human msc, we performed differential gene expression profiling using the genome-wide affymetrix genechip technology. three adult msc donors and three native fat cell donors were used in this study and up-loaded to the online chip comparison database https://www.sipagene.de/sipagene. we compared the gene expression profiles of  <dig> individual group samples of adipogenically induced p <dig> human msc grown in adipogenic media  of days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with the undifferentiated msc samples of day  <dig> . additionally, we compared the gene expression profiles of  <dig> samples of human fat tissues with the gene expression profiles of the corresponding msc on day  <dig> . comparative testing of small groups is difficult. using several statistical measures of the database at the same time, we tried to overcome this limitation - for example the percentage of increased or decreased change calls in all  <dig> Ã—  <dig> =  <dig> pairwise comparisons between the individual chips of each group, the mean of the slr and the corresponding fold change, p-values of  <dig> different t-tests and information derived from chip signal calculations including mean -, median -, std - values  as well as present calls. candidate genes were selected based on significance in t-test and increase or decrease - at least in one group comparison, including present call in the group of increased expression. finally, five group comparisons  were performed.

subsequently, as part of a two-step approach , we identified genes with either consistently increased or consistently decreased expression in each of the five group comparisons and therefore are of interest in the context of adipogenesis. among the  <dig>  probe-sets of the genome-wide genechips we found  <dig> genes to be differentially expressed in a highly significant way . from this group  <dig> genes had increased expression values  and  <dig> genes showed decreased expression values , therefore both files represent candidate genes of interest in adipogenic development.

to check for correct annotation of the target sequences of the identified probe sets shown in additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig>  we compared the sequences to entries of the refseq release  <dig> using blast http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi and aligner . most target sequences mapped with 100% match to the 3' end of the corresponding refseq entries for mrnas. for some probe sets the mapping indicated that polyadenylation may occur upstream of the target sequences, may include intron sequences or may even locate outside of sequences referenced to known genes and transcripts - see additional file  <dig> - part a /part b .

finally, we confirmed by quantitative rt- pcr that the gene expression of known adipogenic marker genes were increased in adipocytes, generated not only from primary layers, but also from strictly individualized clones . the clonogenic cells generating the clones were bonafide msc since they were also able, under appropriate conditions, to differentiate into osteoblasts and chondrocytes  <cit> .

cluster analysis of adipogenic gene expression profile
hierarchical cluster analysis of genes was performed using the clustering tool genesis. as shown in figure  <dig>  for all  <dig> differentially expressed genes, undifferentiated msc  clustered in one main group while mscs cultured under adipogenic conditions and the native fat cell tissues clustered into another. this latter group further sub-divided into two groups, one consisting of msc induced to differentiate into adipocytes, and the other consisting of native fat tissue samples. the group of adipogenic-induced msc was also further sub-divided into two groups, representing either msc induced for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days. based on these  <dig> candidate genes, it was possible to detect striking differences in gene expression characteristic of adipogenic differentiation. gene clusters were found to discriminate undifferentiated stem cells  from early committed cells , cells in an advanced stage of differentiation/maturation , and fully differentiated adipocytes . genes characteristic of the different steps of differentiation are presented in detail in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  since the variability of the experimental groups was not very high, further statistical analysis was performed only using mean values of the genes with selectively increased and decreased expression levels.

k-means clustering and database - assisted biochemical pathway analysis
for the  <dig> genes that were selected , two different follow-up analysis strategies were used: k-means clustering and biochemical pathway analysis. applying k-means,  <dig> genes were clustered according to a similar course of expression. the number of clusters was estimated by figure-of-merit analysis  <cit> . sixteen different clusters could be determined, each of them composed of 1- <dig> different genes. applying this strategy, we directly compared all signal values of various kinetic expression profiles. here it was possible to analyze the expression status of human msc during adipogenesis and in comparison with native fat tissue. moreover, groups of genes with a similar expression profile could be identified .

it was also feasible to observe the expression profiles of different cluster genes  and to find further early and late stage adipogenesis marker genes with similar qualities. for example, cluster  <dig> included the early stage adipogenesis genes pparg as well as adipoq, while in cluster  <dig> the very early stage adipogenesis gene plin, but also igf  <dig> was found. the difference between both clusters was demonstrated by the classic kinetic shape of their expression profiles. for the biochemical pathway analysis,  <dig> increased expression adipogenic candidate genes were loaded into the databases david  <cit>  and kegg  <cit> , and then further divided into sub-groups  or just analyzed  depending on their known function, such as pparg signalling or fatty acid biosynthesis . a few strongly expressed candidate genes could not be integrated into our group system according to their already known biochemical function. here of course it is interesting to discuss their possible role during adipogenesis. sometimes, candidate genes with decreased expression values do interact with known biochemical pathways, but quite often we do not find a logical explanation in terms of adipogenesis.

the  <dig> selected genes were analyzed in different online databases , for example in gene studies and the gene products were subsequently in biochemical pathway studies performed. genes, up-regulated during adipogenesis were of most interest. this table  <dig> shows pathways and corresponding genes. for gene names and mean signal values see the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  charts that illustrate expression values as a function of time are presented in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> 

therefore our main focus was on up-regulated genes: only some of the decreased genes will be discussed here and are shown in table  <dig> or in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  most likely, these down-regulated genes inhibit or repress the outcome of biochemical interactions during the process of adipogenesis. in the following, we will highlight some of the most interesting pathways involved in adipogenesis.

the ppar-gamma signalling pathway
we found at least three essential transcription factors of the pparg signalling pathway to be up-regulated: the ccaat/enhancer binding protein Î± , the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Î³  and the retinoid x receptor Î± . we already identified direct targets such as carboxylesterase  <dig>  and gycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like  to be up-regulated .

additional genes implicated in adipogenesis
we also found up-regulation of at least three subsequent adipogenic target pathways:  here just called genes implicated in early adipogenesis, such as the adipocyte differentiation pathway with the two very early fatty acid binding proteins perilipin  and fatty acid-binding protein  <dig> , as well as  adiponectin , a hormone which is thought to be active further downstream in the adipocytokine signalling pathway and, subsequently, in the differentiation process. furthermore, we found up-regulated expression of genes involved in fatty acid transport such as fatty acid transport with the hormone and receptor protein apolipoprotein e  as well as apolipoprotein l,  <dig> , collagen, type v, -alpha  <dig> , fibronectin leucine rich transmembrane protein  <dig> , lectin galactoside-binding, soluble,  <dig>  and c-type lectin domain family  <dig>  member a  as well as the classic transport and reducing enzyme lipoproteinlipase . we also detected up-regulated expression of factors involved in triggering lipogenesis , such as stearoyl-coa-desaturase , acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase beta , diacylglycerol-o-acyltransferase homolog  <dig> , fatty acid synthase , l-3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme a-dehydrogenase short chain , and steroid  <dig> alphareductase 2-like .

the insulin-like signalling pathway
furthermore, genes encoding signalling cascades that are involved in carbohydrate metabolisms as well as in cell growth and cellular interactions were also found to be up-regulated. accordingly, during the observed time period a strongly up-regulated expression was found for the human msc growth hormone receptor  as well as for some transcription factors of the insulin-like signalling pathway  such as the insulin-like growth factor 1-somatomedin c , insulin-like growth factor  <dig> receptor , insulin induced gene  <dig> , insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig> , and the insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig> .

the apoptosis pathway
we detected a whole set of apoptotic factors which were up- or down-regulated during adipogenesis. apoptosis factors or modulators with increased expression during adipogenesis were the activin a receptor type ic , complement component  <dig> , pi-3-kinase-related kinase smg- <dig> , casp <dig> and fadd-like apoptosis regulator , amine oxidase copper containing  <dig>  , cell death-inducing dffa-like effector c , dead  box polypeptide  <dig> , c1q and tumor necrosis factor related protein  and rna binding motif protein  <dig> . we also found at least five apoptosis factors with decreased gene expression including prkc apoptosis wt <dig> regulator , bh <dig> interacting domain death agonist , mortality factor  <dig> like  <dig> , heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein c   and sulfatase  <dig> .

other molecules that have not yet been described in the context of adipogenesis
finally, new candidate genes coding for proteins and possible regulatory factors, which may be related to the adipogenesis of human msc, have been identified. in particular, strong up-regulation of gene expression was found for the human receptor protein scavenger receptor class a member 5-putative  with a putative transmembrane domain and a collagen-like domain, and the endoplasmic reticulum protein melanocortin  <dig> receptor accessory protein , and as well as some zinc finger receptors  such as the proteins imap family member  <dig> .

discussion
in this work we have isolated from bone marrow aspirates human mesenchymal stem cells characterized by their surface marker profile  <cit>  and their osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic potential  <cit>  to study the expression profile of genes involved during maturation and adipogenic differentiation. these cells showed all the important characteristics of human msc and were further used for gene expression profiling analysis during adipogenic development. in studies of human mesenchymal tissue development, the analysis of expression of specific genes, carried out over a distinct time period, is relevant to understanding the maturation process. since the applied cocktail of adipogenic inducers, dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, indomethacin and insulin, was sufficient to promote differentiation of human msc to adipocytes, these msc were further used for gene expression profiling during adipogenesis. our data helped identifying gene sets characterizing the sequential differentiation steps from stem cells to fully differentiated adipocytes. in our study, we observed differentially expressed genes coding for molecules that have not yet been described in the context of adipogenesis. for example the expression of human receptor gene scara <dig> and the endoplasmic reticulum protein gene mrap were highly up-regulated, suggesting new candidate genes effective in adipocytic differentiation. also we have confirmed most of the already described marker genes involved in adipogenesis  <cit> .

the pparg signalling pathway has been intensively studied over several years and scenario through which various adipocyte transcription factors interact with adipogenic target genes have already been proposed  <cit> . pparg is a hormone receptor, which has already been demonstrated to be the master regulator of adipogenesis  <cit> . the dependent downstream-regulation cascade can be controlled by pparg itself or by pparg in combination with the controlling factor c/ebpa .

it is very likely that c/ebpa and pparg direct the final phase of adipogenesis by activating expression of adipocyte-specific genes, such as fatty acid synthetase, fatty acid binding protein, leptin and adiponectin. however, the mainstream interaction between pparg as well as the rxra receptor, another gene product was found to be up-regulated during adipogenesis in our study via ligand-binding, results in a conformational change, namely in the formation of a special heterodimeric protein structure. the remaining functional domain within the complex binds to various peroxisome proliferator response elements  and therefore activates transcription of adipogenic target genes via phosphorylation events, or, alternatively, causes induction of co-activator and co-repressor complexes  <cit> . it has been claimed that about  <dig> proteins can be controlled by pparg, probably via the pparg-rxra signalling pathway  <cit> . therefore, it was not surprising that various biochemical subgroups belonging to carbohydrate metabolism, citrate cycle and energy transfer or ion transport could be reformed on the basis of the identified adipogenic candidate genes. interestingly, we found the pparg target ces <dig>  an enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum and responsible for cellular detoxification  <cit>  to be highly up-regulated. another pparg target example is presented by the addition of a second gpd <dig> enzyme type. the pparg-rxra signalling expression pattern leads to several additional downstream adipogenic target genes and corresponding pathways, which are either up- or down-regulated  <cit> . of course, we also found other up-regulated pparg targets, such as the transcripts coding for fatty acid-binding fabp <dig>  <cit>  and plin, which binds to fatty acids in such a way that lipid droplets are formed and fatty acids are protected against degrading enzymes  <cit> . furthermore, the mobilization of the stored triglyceride is thought to be controlled by interactions among intracellular lipases during hormone-mediated lipolysis and other proteins that coat lipid storage droplets  <cit> . in our study, the mean value of plin was greatly increased after  <dig> days as was that of the hormone adipoq, which is also a known downstream target of the pparg-rxra-regulator. recently, pparg has received attention as a possible pharmacological target for the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic drugs as it is essential for the final phase of adipocyte differentiation and the pro-adipogenic effects of thiazolidinediones have spurred interest in identifying therapeutic compounds that retain anti-diabetic activity without promoting adipogenesis. inhibitors of pparg activity that reduces adipogenesis and thus serve as the basis for the development of effective anti-obesity drugs  <cit>  have already been identified.

further highly expressed genes  were grouped together according to their known biological function and pathway. the lipogenesis group includes fatty acid synthase , which synthesizes fatty acids . this group also includes the enzymes acacb, srd5a2l, hadhsc, and dgat <dig>  acacb is a biotin-containing enzyme, which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa, the rate-limiting step in the fatty acid synthesis. but acacb is also a complex multifunctional enzyme system, which controls fatty acid oxidation through the ability of malonyl-coa to inhibit carnitine-palmitoyl-coa transferase i.

as expected we found the adipokine and adiponectin metabolism  to be up-regulated. adipoq encodes a central cytokine, which is released by adipocytes. it is involved in the control of fat metabolism and insulin sensitivity, with direct anti-diabetic, anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. in the human body, adiponectin stimulates the phosphorylation of the amp activated protein kinase  in liver and the skeletal muscle, antagonizes tnf-Î± by negatively regulating its expression in various tissues such as liver and macrophages, and also by counteracting its effects in adipocytes by enhancing glucose utilization and fatty-acid production  <cit> . the inhibitory potential of tnf-Î± is mediated using the endothelial nf-kappa-b signalling camp-dependent pathway  <cit> . adipoq also plays a role in cell growth, angiogenesis and tissue remodelling by binding and sequestering various growth factors. it is very likely that adiponectin interacts with one of the collagens or is part of the extracellular matrix system  <cit> . at least one of the known collagen receptor genes, col5a <dig>  was slightly up-regulated in our study. we also detected the up-regulation of typical cell-cell signalling factor genes with adhesive/cytokine like function, such as clec1a and lgals <dig>  it has been shown that lgals <dig> can protect mitochondrial membrane integrity and models suggested that it acts as an anti-apoptotic factor, because it prevents cytochrome c release, thereby blocking the effector stage of apoptosis  <cit> . it was discussed in literature that apol <dig> can contribute to the formation of ion channels through intracellular membranes and is therefore involved in mechanisms triggering programmed cell death  <cit> . in any case, the regulator hormone adipoq consists of a collagen domain by itself and can pass through different cellular membranes without any alteration of the domain. acacb is also part of the adipocytokine signalling pathway and seems to play a central enzyme role in rats as well as in man and alterations of the expression pattern can possibly be responsible for obesity, diabetes  <cit> , and other metabolic pathway activities.

in addition, cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha  and other transforming growth factors interfere with adipocyte differentiation. as expected, not all typical examples for adipocytokines  or resistin) are expressed in all types of tissues identically  <cit>  - and some adipocytokines were not found in this study. nevertheless, we detected members that are involved in the adipocytokine-signalling pathway such as flrt <dig>  of which the protein product might also function as a receptor signalling protein as well as a cell adhesion protein  <cit> .

during the adipogenic maturation process, media containing insulin may have resulted in the development of insulin-independent mechanisms  <cit> . this phenomenon probably was the reason why the insulin-independent cellular membrane receptor, which is called glucose transporter-member  <dig> , was missing in our candidate gene list. instead we found up-regulation of the lipoprotein gene stomatin . over-expression of this lipoprotein often results in depressing the basal rate of glucose transport by decreasing the intrinsic activity of glut <dig>  <cit> . however, we also detected insulin-dependent genes, such as insig <dig>  which have been suggested as a target of pparg  <cit> .

during adipogenic differentiation, we found that the expression of igfbp <dig> was down-regulated. the insulin-like growth factor binding family is thought to modify most igf <dig> actions  <cit>  and is very important for human growth, while insulin by itself can bind to the igf <dig> receptor to activate the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-phosphat kinase /akt -signal mechanism of the cellular structure  <cit> . however, a few members of igfbp family, such as igfbp <dig>  do have other biochemical functions. for example igfbp <dig> also binds directly to insulin and in an artificial cell system it was recently demonstrated that glioma cell growth can be mediated by expressing igfbp <dig>  <cit> . this observation fits very well with our second finding, and therefore we assume again that igfbp <dig> has a negative effect on adipocyte differentiation. igfbp <dig> can modulate the stimulatory effect of vascular endothelial growth factors  on angiogenesis by interfering with vegf expression  <cit> . on the other hand, igfbp <dig> is thought to be associated with proteins of the extracellular matrix  like fibronectin depending on bound molecules, which might interfere with igf <dig> and further growth activities  <cit> .

strikingly, we detected increased expression of members of the angiotensin ii modulator family, such as the angiotensin ii type  <dig> receptor  gene, coding for a receptor whose action is mediated by association with g proteins, which activate the phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. the human rennin-angiotensin system can be activated by agtr1a, while angiotensin ii is the main regulator or effector of the cellular proliferation and survival  <cit> . recently, many publications demonstrated that tissue specificity is achieved by modulation of the angiotensin receptor proteins together with effector proteins  <cit> , which would fit well with our data and implies that agtr1a is involved in the adipocyte development. we also found up-regulation of a further g protein-coupled receptor gene, the cannabinoid receptor  <dig> , called cnr <dig>  <cit> . the cnr <dig> receptor is the most abundant g protein-coupled receptor expressed in the brain. however, cnr <dig> has also been detected in adipocytes, which is consistent with our data, suggesting that cnr <dig> is directly or indirectly effective on adipogenesis.

the regulatory factor lipopolysaccharide-induced tnf-Î± factor , which was down-regulated during adipogenesis until day  <dig> and expressed at much lower levels when compared with native fat cell tissue, might play an important modifying role in tnf-Î± gene expression either through induction of lipopolysaccharides  or via using the apoptotic tp53/p <dig> pathway. moreover, some fatty acids act as signalling molecules regulating the differentiation into adipocytes or cell death.

we also found up- or down-regulation of a number of transcripts coding for factors implicated in apoptosis such as litaf, prkc, pawr, bid, morf4l <dig>  and hnrpc. it has been shown very recently that litaf is a transcription factor, which plays an important role in regulating the expression of tnf-Î± and various other inflammatory cytokines in response to lps stimulation, negatively affecting adipocytic regulation  <cit> , but this observation still has to be confirmed. with our comparison approach we demonstrated that several other apoptotic factors or mediators have been increased or decreased during adipogenesis of human msc. the pawr  expression was down-regulated as well. it has regulatory control functions via down-regulating the b-cell lymphoma  <dig>  gene expression. the bh <dig> interacting domain death agonist  was also down-regulated and is responsible for the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. two further down-regulated transcription factor candidates, which do both belong to a part of the apoptosis pathway, are the transcription factor genes mortality factor  <dig> like  <dig>  and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein c  .

we detected the up-regulation of genes, whose encoding factors yet are unrelated to adipogenesis, such as scara <dig> and mrap. it is already known that scara <dig> is a ferritin receptor mediating non-transferrin iron delivery, which is essential for cell growth  <cit> , and that mrap might control cellular trafficking with the help of other transmembrane proteins  <cit> . our data suggest their positive effect on adipogenesis, which should be further investigated in gain and loss of function studies. we also observed up-regulation of central genes coding for enzymes of the glycolytic pathway such as hexokinase  <dig> , which is integrated in mitochondrial membranes instead of working in the cytosol  <cit> , as well as many stress proteins such as the peroxisome control enzyme catalyze .

as a follow-up strategy it will be important to identify regulatory networks related to specific transcription factors. search tools like rvista  <cit>  suggest further regulatory proteins or transcription factors based only on potential binding sites upstream of the genomic sequence of the named genes and calculate the probability that individual binding sites are identified with a significantly increased frequency. for example, the list of our up-regulated candidates  returned gata <dig>  hfh <dig>  ap <dig>  foxo <dig>  pou6f <dig>  foxo <dig>  gre, isre, lbp <dig>  foxp <dig> as potential candidates involved in the regulation of these genes. however, this approach can only generate hypotheses, which require further confirmation by other techniques like chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by array hybridisation. it also will be interesting to check, if some of the detected adipogenic genes of the defined clusters or from one biochemical group  perform a familiar pattern of transcriptional regulation or to find de novo binding strategies on the promotor site of the genes in further experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
adipogenesis is the developmental process by which multipotent msc differentiate into mature adipocytes. we confirmed observations by others that several molecular factors and biochemical pathways are involved in this complex process of adipogenesis. however and to go beyond the state-of-art, we analyzed the entire gene expression profiles of human msc during adipogenesis over a defined time scale and compared the findings with the expression profile of native fat cell tissue as a reference. in this regard our emphasis was on differentially expressed genes coding for key molecules and transcription factors of fat cell development and on the involvement of such factors in biochemical signalling pathways. a battery of known  and new  adipogenic marker genes was found, and some of the newly identified marker genes were linked to specific biochemical signalling pathways.

using the online chip database sipagene it was possible to establish a comprehensive kinetic gene expression system and a network of adipogenesis genes, which otherwise could only be found using multiple special search approaches.
