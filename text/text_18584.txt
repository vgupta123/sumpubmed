BACKGROUND
the plant pathogen phytophthora cinnamomi causes considerable damage to agriculture, horticulture and native plant communities worldwide  <cit> . phosphite , an analogue of phosphate  is a salt of phosphorous acid  and is highly effective in controlling p. cinnamomi <cit> . however, little is known about the mode of action of phi on induction of resistance to this pathogen. understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant―phytophthora cinnamomi interactions and the effect of phi on these interactions may allow the design of strategies to improve disease resistance or the more effective use of phi.

resistance to potential pathogens depends on interaction between different plant defence signalling pathways such as those regulated by the phytohormones salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , ethylene , abscisic acid , and auxin  <cit> . synergistic and antagonistic interactions between different signalling pathways induced by phytohormones and their effect on induction of resistance to biotrophic or necrotrophic pathogens have been well documented  <cit> .

phi is believed to mimic pi and interferes with the manifestation of a wide range of biochemical and developmental pi starvation responses  in arabidopsis thaliana and other plant species  <cit> . pi status is very important for determining root architecture mediated through the auxin signalling pathway and auxin signalling is required for the full pi starvation response  <cit> .

auxin signalling is mediated largely by the scftir <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex  that accelerates auxin/indole-3-acetic acid  repressor protein degradation in response to auxin  <cit> . the aux/iaa repressor proteins are recognized and ubiquitinated by a ubiquitin-conjugation cycle involving an e <dig> , an e <dig> , and the scftir <dig> e <dig>  which consists of a cullin-cul <dig>  the skp1-ask <dig>  rbx <dig>  and the f-box protein tir <dig>   <cit> . pi modulates auxin sensitivity via the auxin receptor tir <dig> and pi starvation increases the expression of the tir <dig> gene in arabidopsis seedlings leading to degradation of aux/iaa repressors and activation of downstream auxin responses  <cit> . sgt1b protein functions in scf-tir <dig> mediated degradation of aux/iaa proteins  <cit>  and interacts with rar1; a component of r-gene-mediated resistance  <cit> . both rar <dig> and sgt1b interact with cop <dig> which is involved in protein degradation by the 26s proteasome  <cit> . furthermore, auxin has been implicated in the induction of resistance against some necrotrophic pathogens including plectosphaerella cucumerina and botrytis cinerea <cit> .

in conclusion, the involvement of the auxin signalling pathway in plant defence and pi signalling, together with interference of phi in pi homeostasis and psr indicates a possible involvement of the auxin signalling pathway in resistance of some arabidopsis accessions to p. cinnamomi, previously reported to possess a predominantly necrotrophic lifestyle  <cit>  and in phi mediated resistance. the objectives of this study were to examine the potential involvement of pi and auxin signalling pathways in resistance to p. cinnamomi by screening the mutants defective in psr, auxin and ubiquitin signalling pathways for their susceptibility to this pathogen and to investigate whether phi induces resistance to p. cinnamomi by manipulating the psr and auxin signalling pathways by studying the effect of phi on pi signalling and the importance of their concomitant effect on activation/suppression of the auxin response pathway in relation to psr. the mechanism of action of phi was further examined by investigating its effect on morphological psr responses and analysis of pi starvation gene expression following phi treatment under pi sufficient and deficient conditions and in auxin and aba response modulation of pi signalling involving auxin.

RESULTS
resistance to p. cinnamomi was reduced in the pi starvation response mutant
to investigate whether pi signalling affects the response of arabidopsis to p. cinnamomi, ecotype col- <dig> and several psr mutants phr1- <dig>  pho2- <dig>  and pho1- <dig> were screened for their susceptibility to the pathogen and the level of infection was determined quantitatively according to eshraghi et al.  <cit> . the qpcr analysis of infection showed significantly  greater p. cinnamomi biomass in the phr1- <dig> mutant compared to that in its wild background col- <dig>  suggesting a role of pi signalling in resistance to p. cinnamomi. furthermore, transferring the cloned phr <dig> gene into the susceptible phr1- <dig> mutant restored resistance to the level observed in the parental background col- <dig>  confirming that the mutant was susceptible due to loss of phr <dig> function. the phr <dig> gene contributes to downstream pi signalling by regulating the expression of pi responsive genes  <cit>  and the phr <dig> mutant is defective in pi signalling  <cit> . pho <dig> and pho <dig> both act downstream of the phr <dig> transcription factor to control the local uptake or transport of pi  <cit> . the pho2- <dig> and pho1- <dig> mutants did not show significant  increase in their susceptibility to p. cinnamomi compared to col- <dig> .

the scftir <dig> complex is involved in resistance to p. cinnamomi infection
the high susceptibility of the phr1- <dig> mutant in the current study, combined with the role of the auxin signalling pathway in the psr and plant resistance  <cit>  suggested a possible involvement of auxin signalling in resistance to p. cinnamomi. qpcr assessment of pathogen biomass showed that tir1-1; an auxin response mutant deficient in the auxin-stimulated scf  ubiquitination pathway  <cit>  was highly susceptible to p. cinnamomi . furthermore, transferring the cloned tir <dig> gene into the tir1- <dig> mutant restored resistance to the level observed in the parental background col- <dig>  and confirmed that susceptibility was due to loss of tir <dig> function in the mutant.

since arabidopsis sgt1b contributes to the auxin response controlled by the scftir <dig> complex  <cit>  and functions in plant disease resistance signalling  <cit> , we investigated whether mutations in sgt1b also affect resistance to p. cinnamomi. qpcr analysis showed no significant  differences in susceptibility of sgt1b- <dig> in comparison to its wild parental background col- <dig>  suggesting that sgt1b does not contribute to scf-related processes in resistance to p. cinnamomi.

the 26s proteasome subunits are involved in resistance to p. cinnamomi
the 26s proteasome is involved in the degradation of aux/iaa proteins and consequently activation of auxin responsive genes  <cit> . in the present study, several arabidopsis mutants defective in 26s proteasome subunits  were screened for their susceptibility to p. cinnamomi. the analysis of infection revealed that the arabidopsis mutants pbe <dig>  a knockout mutant for 20s proteasome  <cit>  and rpn <dig> with reduced auxin sensitivity  <cit>  were both significantly  more susceptible to p. cinnamomi compared to their parental background col- <dig>  with  <dig>  and  <dig>  pathogen biomass , respectively . furthermore, the susceptibility of the arabidopsis 26s proteasome subunit mutants rpt5a , rpt2a , and rpt2b  was significantly  higher compared to that in their background col- <dig> .

inhibition of auxin transport by tiba treatments enhanced p. cinnamomi infection
the susceptibility of the arabidopsis auxin response mutant tir1- <dig> <cit>  suggested the involvement of auxin response pathway in the outcome of a. thaliana―p. cinnamomi resistance . to test this further, blue lupin  seedlings were treated with an auxin transport inhibitor, tiba, and their susceptibility determined. for these studies we used blue lupin rather than arabidopsis because of the large size of the root system and susceptibility to p. cinnamomi allowing clearer observation of potential differences. infection in lupin seedling roots treated with tiba was significantly  greater than in non-treated plants 72 h after inoculation .

expression of pi-and auxin signalling-related genes in response to phi treatments
the relative expression ratios of the pi responsive genes atpt <dig>  atacp <dig> and at <dig>  in col- <dig> grown under pi sufficient or pi deficient conditions were analysed following phi treatments . the transcript levels of at <dig>  atpt <dig>  and atacp <dig> increased significantly  in response to pi deficiency in wild ecotype col- <dig> . in contrast, the transcript levels of the at <dig>  atpt <dig>  and atacp <dig> genes were greatly suppressed  when the pi starved plants were treated with  <dig>  mm phi. furthermore, the high level of phi  suppressed the up-regulation of at <dig> , atpt <dig> , and atacp <dig>  in response to pi deficiency to the levels observed in plants grown in pi sufficient  conditions demonstrating an impact of phi on the psr .

given the apparent involvement of the pi and auxin signalling pathways in the resistance of col- <dig>  the interaction of these pathways with aba signalling  <cit>  and previous observations of the susceptibility of aba signalling mutants by eshraghi et al.  <cit> , the effects of phi treatment on psr gene expression was investigated in col- <dig>  aba2- <dig> and tir1- <dig> plants . the transcript level of the at <dig> in pi deficient, non-phi-treated col- <dig>  aba2- <dig> and tir1- <dig> significantly  increased 100-fold, 112-fold, and 111-fold, respectively compared to pi sufficient col- <dig>  however, phi treatments resulted in suppression of the at <dig> gene in all plants tested with the level of this suppression depended on the concentration of phi applied .

in non-phi-treated col- <dig>  the transcript level of phr <dig>  in response to pi deficiency increased  and phi treatments suppressed the transcript level of this gene with the highest suppression in 20 mm phi-treated plants . although phi treatment in pi deficient grown samples suppressed the expression of phr <dig>  the transcript level of this gene was induced in col- <dig> samples grown in pi sufficient media and the level of this induction depended on the concentration of phi applied in this study . the expression of phr <dig> in response to pi starvation was diminished in aba2- <dig> and tir1- <dig> mutants compared to that in col- <dig> indicating the importance of aba <dig> and tir <dig> genes in induction of phr <dig>  furthermore, phi treatments had no significant  effect on transcript level of the phr <dig> gene in either the aba2- <dig> or tir1- <dig> mutants suggesting that mutation in aba <dig> and tir <dig> genes may disrupt the phi effect on pi signalling.

the high susceptibility of the arabidopsis mutant tir1- <dig>  and the enhanced level of p. cinnamomi infection in roots of tiba-treated lupins  showed that the auxin response pathway plays an important role in resistance to p. cinnamomi. in addition, the induction of phr <dig> gene by phi in col- <dig> samples grown in pi sufficient media suggested that phi induces psr and loss of phr <dig> gene expression in the tir1- <dig> mutant highlighted the possible induction of the auxin response pathway by phi treatments. therefore, we hypothesised that phi mediated resistance to p. cinnamomi may be through induction of the auxin response pathway.

to test this hypothesis, the concomitant effect of phi and pi on auxin signalling in pi sufficient/pi deficient grown col- <dig>  aba2- <dig> and tir1- <dig> mutants following  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and 20 mm phi treatments was assessed by measuring the relative expression ratios of auxin responsive genes, aux <dig>  axr <dig>  axr <dig> and sgt1b transcripts . in non-phi-treated col- <dig> seedlings, pi deficiency increased the transcript levels of aux <dig> , axr <dig> , axr <dig>  and sgt1b  genes indicating activation of the auxin response pathway in pi deficient plants . in pi sufficient col- <dig>  phi treatments  induced significantly  the transcript levels of aux <dig>  axr <dig>  axr <dig> and sgt1b genes and the level of this induction depended on the phi concentrations used . addition of phi to pi starved plants at  <dig>  mm suppressed the enhanced transcript level of aux <dig> ; while, phi treatments at  <dig>  mm had no significant  effect on the expression of axr <dig>  axr <dig> and sgt1b in pi deficient col- <dig> . however, application of phi at higher concentrations  to pi starved plants had no significant  effect on the expression of aux <dig>  axr <dig>  axr <dig> and sgt1b genes .

in pi deficient, non-phi-treated aba2- <dig> mutant, the transcript levels of aux <dig>  axr <dig>  axr <dig> and sgt1b genes did not increase significantly  compared to that in the pi sufficient, non-phi-treated aba2- <dig> mutant  suggesting that psr- responsive expression of the auxin responsive genes is reliant on aba signalling. furthermore, application of phi to the aba2- <dig> mutant grown under either pi sufficient or pi deficient conditions did not increase transcript level of auxin responsive genes  with the exception of  <dig>  mm phi-treated plants for the axr <dig> gene . these results suggest that the phi-mediated activation of auxin responsive genes may involve aba signalling. in the tir1- <dig> mutant, pi starvation did not considerably change the transcription levels of the auxin responsive genes aux <dig>  axr <dig>  axr <dig> and sgt1b confirming a role for tir <dig> in induction of the psr. furthermore, application of phi in pi sufficient or deficient conditions to tir1- <dig> did not affect the transcript levels of the auxin responsive genes tested with the exception of axr <dig> in  <dig>  mm phi-treated, pi deficient plants . the results indicate that aba <dig> is to some extent required for both psr induced auxin responsive genes and phi induced auxin responsive gene expression. likewise, tir <dig> is required for both psr and phi mediated auxin responsive gene expression, suggesting that phi may act through mechanisms involving both aba and auxin.

effects of phi treatment on auxin-mediated root architecture
given the potential of phi to mimic the psr in terms of auxin responsive gene expression, the potential for phi to interfere with morphological responses of plant roots to pi starvation was investigated.

the primary root length of pi starved col- <dig> seedlings was significantly  shorter than that in seedlings grown in pi sufficient media . application of phi resulted in suppression of primary root growth in seedlings grown in pi sufficient media and the level of this suppression depended on the phi concentrations used . pi starvation induced root hair formation in non-phi treated seedlings compared to that observed in pi sufficient grown col- <dig> seedlings . furthermore, treatment of seedlings with a low concentration of phi  resulted in suppression of root hair formation in pi sufficient grown seedlings, while in 20 mm phi-treated seedlings root hair density was increased . phi at both  <dig>  mm and 20 mm concentrations inhibited root hair formation induced by pi starvation.

discussion
the findings of this study supported the role of auxin signalling in the induction of resistance to the predominantly necrotrophic pathogen p. cinnamomi. we further illustrate the effect of phi on pi signalling and the importance of their concomitant effect on activation/suppression of the auxin response pathway in relation to psr.

phosphate starvation response mutant showed susceptibility to p. cinnamomi
the involvement of phi in resistance to p. cinnamomi <cit>  and its interference in the phosphate starvation responses  <cit>  suggested a possible role of pi signalling in the outcome of a. thaliana―p. cinnamomi interactions. qpcr analysis of infection revealed that phr1- <dig>  a mutant defective in response to pi starvation was highly susceptible to p. cinnamomi; while, the mutants pho2- <dig> and pho1- <dig> remained resistant. the myb-like transcription factor encoded by the phosphate starvation response  <dig>  is vital for adaptation to phosphate deficiency in arabidopsis <cit>  and this gene contributes to downstream pi signalling by regulating the expression of pi-responsive genes  <cit> . the pho <dig> in arabidopsis is a sub-component of the pi-signalling network that functions downstream of phr <dig> and regulates a subset of pi-dependent responses, including pi allocation between the shoot and the root  <cit> . thus, mutation in the phr <dig> gene impairs many pi signalling-related functions  <cit> , while pho <dig> and pho <dig> mutations individually attenuate pi uptake and distribution within tissues  <cit> . up-regulation of pho <dig> is shown to be dependent on the phr <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . furthermore, the cross talk between pi, aba and auxin signal transduction pathways have been suggested by ribot et al.  <cit>  demonstrating that application of exogenous aba and auxin down-regulates the expression of pho <dig> independent of the plants’ pi status  <cit> . therefore, mutation of phr <dig> is likely to affect other pi responses in addition to those dependent on pho <dig> and pho <dig> and the regulation of these responses, and resistance to p. cinnamomi, may be associated with aba and/or auxin signalling.

auxin response pathway is involved in p. cinnamomi resistance
the phytohormone auxin, in addition to being involved in many aspects of development and growth in healthy plants  <cit> , plays an important role in plant–pathogen interactions  <cit> . together the role of the auxin  signalling pathway in the psr  <cit> , plant disease resistance  <cit>  and the high susceptibility of phr1- <dig> observed in the present study suggested a possible involvement of auxin signalling in resistance to p. cinnamomi. the qpcr analysis of p. cinnamomi infection in inoculated leaves of col- <dig> and auxin-related mutants showed that tir1- <dig>  an auxin receptor mutant was highly susceptible to p. cinnamomi. an effective auxin response in arabidopsis depends on the removal of aux/iaa family of transcriptional factor  repressors through auxin-stimulated binding by the scftir <dig> complex  <cit>  and the tir <dig> protein acts as an auxin receptor which directly links auxin perception to degradation of the aux/iaa repressor proteins. in arabidopsis auxin response mutants, the defective degradation of aux/iaa transcriptional repressor proteins affect the induction of auxin response factors  and consequently the expression of auxin responsive genes  <cit> . therefore, the susceptibility of the tir1- <dig> mutant which is defective in the f-box tir <dig> protein and aux/iaa degradation  <cit>  suggested that ubiquitin-mediated aux/iaa protein degradation is important in plant resistance to p. cinnamomi.

tiba  treatment also led to the enhanced susceptibility of lupin seedlings to p. cinnamomi suggesting that the suppression of auxin transporters and consequently distruption of auxin signalling is important in plant resistance to p. cinnamomi. llorente et al.  <cit>  also suggested the involvement of the auxin signalling pathway in resistance to necrotrophic pathogens by demonstrating that the suppression of the auxin response pathway enhanced the susceptibility of arabidopsis to botrytis cinerea and plectosphaerella cucumerina.

in arabidopsis, sgt1b contributes to the auxin response controlled by the scftir <dig> complex  <cit> , through scf-tir <dig> mediated degradation of aux/iaa repressor proteins  <cit> . sgt1b also functions in r gene mediated plant disease resistance signalling and in this regard interacts with rar <dig>  <cit> . when challenged with p. cinnamomi the sgt1b- <dig> mutant showed no significant  difference to its parental background col- <dig>  suggesting that sgt1b contributes a redundant role to resistance to p. cinnamomi. together the susceptibility of tir1- <dig>  the enhanced susceptibility of tiba-treated plants and the resistance of sgt1b- <dig> indicated that auxin plays a substantial role in resistance to p. cinnamomi through a scftir1-mediated ubiquitination mechanisim that is independent to sgt1b function.

involvement of 26s proteasome in a. thaliana–p. cinnamomi interaction
the 26s proteasome is involved in the ubiquitination of aux/iaa proteins and consequently activation of auxin responsive genes  <cit> , and mutants that are compromised in 26s proteasome activity attenuate auxin sensitivity and other plant processes such as root apical meristems maintenance, leaf organ size and gametophyte developments  <cit> . in the present study, several arabidopsis mutants defective in 26s proteasome subunits  were screened for their susceptibility to p. cinnamomi. the analysis of pathogen infection revealed that pbe <dig>  a 20s proteasome knockout mutant was highly susceptible to p. cinnamomi in comparison to its parental background col- <dig>  in addition, the rpn <dig> mutant, defective in ubiquitin/26s proteasome-mediated proteolysis in auxin and aba signalling, was susceptible to p. cinnamomi. rpn <dig> is a subunit of the 26s proteasome pathway which affects several regulatory processes in arabidopsis by directing the unwanted proteins to the 26s proteasome for degradation  <cit> . the arabidopsis rpn <dig> mutant shows a decreased sensitivity to auxin and is highly sensitive to exogenous application of aba  <cit> . the reduction in auxin sensitivity in rpn <dig> may relate to its susceptibility to p. cinnamomi and further supports a role for tir1/26s proteosome in resistance to p. cinnamomi.

furthermore, arabidopsis 26s proteasome subunit mutants rpt5a, rpt2a and rpt2b  also showed a higher level of susceptibility compared to that observed in their parental background col- <dig>  the susceptibility of the mutants defective in 26s proteasome subunits to p. cinnamomi suggested a role of 26s proteasome subunits in resistance to p. cinnamomi, possibly through degradation of auxin inhibitor proteins following their ubiquitination by tir <dig> 

concomitant effect of phi and pi is relevant for the activation/suppression of psr- and auxin-related genes
the role of phi in induction of resistance to phytophthora has been demonstrated in several studies suggesting its complex mode of action including  acting directly by inhibition of pathogen growth,  acting indirectly by inducing the release of stress metabolites from the pathogen to elicit the defence response and  indirectly stimulating host defence responses  <cit> . eshraghi et al.  <cit>  found that phi mediated resistance to p. cinnamomi in the susceptible arabidopsis ecotype ler resembled the response of the resistant ecotype col- <dig> in terms of timing and the defence responses induced. similar observations for phi mediated resistance were reported for p. infestans-challenged potato  <cit>  and p. palmivora-challenged a. thaliana <cit> . previous research demonstrated that phi primed some aspects of the defence response, such as the expression of defence genes involved in the sa, ja/et pathways in the absence of a pathogen  <cit> . however, screening sa and ja/et related knockout mutants in the presence/absence of phi suggested that phi mediated resistance to p. cinnamomi in a. thaliana was independent of the sa, ja or et signalling pathways  <cit> .

phi has also been shown to interfere with a broad range of biochemical and developmental responses including psr in plants  <cit>  many of which have been shown to rely on auxin signalling involving the scftir <dig> upp complex  <cit> . the susceptibility of arabidopsis auxin response pathway mutants and the pi response mutant phr- <dig> to p. cinnamomi in this study together with the interference of phi in pi homeostasis and its role in the induction of plant defence responses against p. cinnamomi <cit>  suggested that phi mediated resistance could be through its’ effect on pi signalling, and in particular, on the auxin signalling pathway.

the transcript levels of the psr responsive genes atpt <dig>  atacp <dig>  and at <dig> increased in response to pi deficiency. however, phi applications at all levels suppressed their enhanced expression similar to that observed in plants grown in pi sufficient media, demonstrating the effect of phi in suppression of psr. these results are supported by ticconi et al.  <cit>  who reported a similar effect of phi on suppression of psr genes. while phr <dig> expression was increased by phi treatment of col- <dig> under pi sufficient conditions, similar increases in expression of atpt <dig>  atacp <dig> and at <dig> were not observed. this may be because phr <dig> contributes to downstream pi signalling by regulating the expression of pi responsive genes  <cit>  and pho <dig> and pho <dig> both act downstream of the phr <dig> transcription factor to control the local uptake or pi allocation between the shoot and the root involving atpt <dig>  at <dig> and atacp <dig> <cit> . although the mutation in the phr <dig> gene impairs many pi signalling-related functions, the studies by ribot et al.  <cit>  suggested that the expression of pho <dig> is independent of the plants’ pi status. therefore, phr <dig> is likely to affect other pi responses in addition to those dependent on pho <dig> and pho <dig> and the regulation of these responses.

perez-torres et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that auxin sensitivity was enhanced in pi deficient arabidopsis plants largely through increased expression of tir <dig>  which accelerated the degradation of aux/iaa proteins. in addition to the potential interaction with psr/auxin signalling described above, eshraghi et al.  <cit>  suggested that phi acts partially through an aba dependent mechanism. therefore, to investigate whether phi acts through tir <dig> or aba <dig> and whether mutations in these two genes are affecting the impact of phi on psr, the effect of phi on expression of at <dig> and phr <dig> at the transcriptional level was further tested in pi sufficient and pi deficient grown col- <dig>  aba2- <dig> and tir1- <dig>  although in col- <dig> phi treatments suppressed the enhanced transcript levels of phr <dig> induced by pi deficiency, phi enhanced the transcript levels of phr <dig> in pi sufficient grown samples and the level of this induction depended on the phi concentrations used. these results suggested that although phi suppressed the psr in pi starved plants, application of phi to pi sufficient plants resulted in activation of psr. one explanation for this may be competition between pi and phi for uptake or transport. it has been shown in brassica spp. that high phi concentrations inhibit plant development by competing with pi absorption  <cit> . our results showed that the expression of phr <dig> in response to pi starvation was affected in the aba2- <dig> and tir1- <dig> mutants suggesting the importance of aba <dig> and tir <dig> genes in the induction of phr <dig> and psr. furthermore, phi treatments had no considerable effect on transcript level of the phr <dig> gene in either aba2- <dig> or tir1- <dig> mutants suggesting that mutation in the aba <dig> and tir <dig> genes may disrupt the phi effect on pi signalling.

the induction of the phr <dig> gene by phi in col- <dig> samples grown in pi sufficient media suggested that phi induces psr and the loss of phr <dig> gene expression in the tir1- <dig> mutant highlighted the possible induction of the auxin response pathway by phi treatments. to test this further, the concomitant effect of phi and pi on auxin signalling in pi sufficient/pi deficient grown col- <dig>  aba2- <dig> and tir1- <dig> mutants was assessed by measuring the relative expression ratios of the auxin responsive genes, aux <dig>  axr <dig>  axr <dig> and sgt1b transcripts. pi deficiency increased the transcript levels of all genes tested suggesting the induction of the auxin response pathway in pi starved plants. in pi sufficient col- <dig>  phi treatments  induced the transcript levels of aux <dig>  axr <dig>  axr <dig> and sgt1b and the level of this induction depended on the phi concentrations used. moreover, pi starvation did not considerably change the transcription levels of the auxin responsive gene aux <dig>  axr <dig>  axr <dig> and sgt1b in the aba2- <dig> and tir1- <dig> mutants confirming a role for aba <dig> and tir <dig> in the induction of the psr. overall, the results suggested that aba <dig> and tir <dig> genes are required for both psr and phi mediated auxin responsive gene expression, indicating that phi may act through both the aba and auxin pathways.

effect of phi on root morphology
considering the potential of phi to mimic the psr in terms of auxin responsive gene expression, the effect on morphological responses to pi starvation was investigated, as pi status acting through auxin signalling is important for determining root architecture  <cit> . pi deficiency suppressed the primary root length and induced root hair formation in roots of ecotype col- <dig> and the application of phi resulted in suppression of primary root growth in seedlings grown in either pi sufficient or pi deficient media in a dose–response manner. the morphological responses of pi starved roots were consistent with those previously described  <cit> . phi at lower concentration  inhibited root hair formation induced under phosphate starvation; however, 20 mm phi induced root hair formation in pi sufficient plants. gilbert et al.  <cit>  also showed that phi dramatically increased the number of proteoid root segments  in pi sufficient lupin seedlings. overall, both, morphological and gene expression data suggested the involvement of the auxin signaling pathway and phosphate signalling in responses to phi treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
this study highlighted the importance of pi signalling in plant resistance to p. cinnamomi by illustrating the susceptibility of phr1- <dig>  and linked this role with the auxin response pathway through the susceptibility of tir1- <dig> and tiba-treated plants to p. cinnamomi. a role for the 26s proteasome, which is required for auxin signalling  <cit> , was further supported by the susceptibility of lines with mutations in various components. moreover, the link between phi treatment and psr, as demonstrated by morphological psr responses and analysis of pi starvation gene expression following phi treatment under pi sufficient and deficient conditions and in auxin and aba response mutants, suggested that the mechanism of action of phi may include modulation of pi signalling involving auxin.
