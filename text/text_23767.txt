BACKGROUND
small rna  regulatory pathways  control gene expression through a variety of mechanisms  <cit> . components of the microrna, small interfering , and piwi rna pathways, three major srrps, are present in mosquitoes  <cit> . in each of these pathways, gene expression is regulated in the cleavage and degradation of mrnas. cellular processes as diverse as development, anti-viral defense and maintenance of the germline are controlled by these mechanisms  <cit> . in general, the size of the cleavage products reveals the pathway by which degradation occurs  <cit> . in mosquitoes and other invertebrates, sirnas of ca. 21- <dig> nts are expected to be produced by a dicer-2/r2d2/argonaute  <dig>  dependent cleavage mechanism, whereas micrornas  are produced by a dicer-1/loquacious/ago <dig> dependent mechanism  <cit> . intriguingly, components from these two pathways do not function exclusively from one another. dicer- <dig> and an alternate spliceform of loquacious interact to produce endogenous sirnas   <cit> . this alternate pathway is also an important regulator of host gene expression and selfish genetic elements  <cit> . piwi pathway products, pirnas, 24- <dig> nts in length, are produced in a dicer-independent manner  <cit> . moreover, an additional srna size class has been described in the anti-ago <dig> antibody immunoprecipitation of unusually small rnas    <cit> .

triggers for srrps are only partially understood. the anti-viral and endo-sirna pathways have a double-stranded rna trigger which activates processing and loading of an 20- <dig> nt sirna guide strand  <cit> . once loaded, the risc may be recycled. the mirna pathway relies on microrna-encoding genes that are processed in a dgcr8/drosha-dependent manner  <cit> . in contrast to sirnas, mirnas, also 20- <dig> nts, bind to target transcripts with imperfect complementarity. piwi pathway srna biogenesis is less understood but likely involves a single-stranded rna trigger .

mosquito-borne dengue virus is a human health threat in tropical urban areas and causes sporadic outbreaks in the southern us  <cit> . it is transmitted to humans by aedine mosquitoes and has bypassed the requirement for an enzootic amplification cycle, thus increasing the threat to public health. arboviruses must successfully replicate in mosquitoes, escape anti-viral defense, and then invade salivary glands in order to be transmitted during blood feeding to subsequent hosts. using radioisotopic detection, newly replicated dengue virus serotype  <dig>  genomes can be detected in ae. aegypti higg's white eye  midguts, the initial site of infection, as early as  <dig> days post infection , and viral interfering srnas  at  <dig> dpi  <cit> . the best described anti-viral rnai pathway relies on a dicer- <dig> dependent mechanism whereby the ago <dig> endonuclease cleaves target rnas  <cit> . silencing of rnai component transcripts ago <dig>  r2d <dig> and dicer- <dig> in ae. aegypti increases denv <dig> titers; therefore these components play an important role in controlling arbovirus replication  <cit> . another component of the rna-induced silencing complex  is tudor-sn , a transcriptional co-factor  <cit> . given the presence of a functional rnai pathway, it remains a mystery as to how arboviruses overcome anti-viral defense to establish persistent infections and perpetuate the arbovirus disease cycle.

srnas represent the product of host mrna or viral rna cleavage in an rnai-specific manner. detection and characterization of rnai pathway degradation products in arbovirus-infected mosquitoes lends insight into the interplay between virus and vector at a level of sensitivity not formerly possible. the goals of this study were to a) characterize changes in virna production and b) to identify host processes that are differentially regulated by rnai over the course of infection. denv <dig> jamaica  <dig>  was used to infect its natural mosquito vector, aedes aegypti. most current rna deep sequencing studies use duplicate technical replicates. by using triplicate biological replicates, deep sequencing and rigorous statistical metrics similar to those used for microarrays, we identify products of rnai pathway activity that are altered in denv2-infected mosquitoes. the resulting data provide a basis for determining cellular pathways important to virus infection. this analysis is unique in that we focus on only those gene targets which are cleaved by post-transcriptional srrps producing srnas from 13- <dig> nts. therefore, targets may be revealed that would not be identified using traditional microarray approaches. alterations to gene expression levels that are controlled at the transcriptional level or by mechanisms of the de-capping or de-adenylation mrna decay pathways will not be considered here  <cit> .

RESULTS
virus feeding
ae. aegypti rexville d-puerto rico were fed a blood meal containing denv <dig> jamaica  <dig> and negative controls were fed blood with an equivalent volume of un-infected insect cell culture homogenate. as with previous studies  <cit> , the mosquitoes had an infection rate of 50% at  <dig> dpi and geometric mean titers of  <dig>  log <dig> plaque-forming units  per mosquito.

rnai machinery components
we performed a series of experiments to determine how ae. aegypti rnai pathway components respond to a blood feeding or denv <dig> infection. hemocytes are critical to mosquito immunity, circulate in the hemolymph and harbor denv <dig> particles  <cit> . to give an indication of whether risc complexes are present in hemolymph before blood feeding, thus supporting the hypothesis that mosquitoes mount an anti-viral response upon infection, soluble fractions were collected using two different methods, separated and probed with anti-ago <dig> antibody. high molecular weight complexes containing ago <dig> are present in cells from hemolymph/fat body fraction prior to a blood meal and depleted at  <dig> day post-blood feeding . purified hemolymph from sugar-fed and blood-fed females showed a  <dig> kda species, and all samples showed the lower molecular bands that are commonly seen in ae. aegypti   <cit> .

to determine whether ago <dig>  dicer- <dig> or tsn expression levels are modulated during denv <dig> infection, we used quantitative real-time pcr to measure component mrna levels in midguts at the initial site of infection. dicer- <dig> and ago <dig> transcript levels were significantly enriched in denv2-infected midguts over un-infected blood-fed controls at  <dig> dpi . at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi, variability in ago <dig> and dicer- <dig> transcript levels increases, thereby negating significant differences compared to un-infected controls. by  <dig> dpi, transcript levels are indistinguishable from those of un-infected controls . in contrast, tsn transcriptional co-factor levels were depleted at  <dig> dpi and enriched at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. immunoprecipitation  of ago <dig> complexes from un-infected blood-fed and denv2-infected mosquitoes  and subsequent cloning revealed srnas of  <dig> to  <dig> nts. the srna sequences prepared from the ip-cloning were not among those of the over- or under-represented host srnas . multiple bands are present in the immunoblot, and there is little difference in the intensity of ago <dig> bands when denv2-infected and blood-fed controls are compared. a faint ago <dig> band at  <dig> kda is present in un-infected mosquito ips and not in denv2-infected mosquitoes.

deep sequencing reveals virus-derived usrnas, sirnas, and pirnas
pools of twenty mosquitoes from three biological replicates each of virus-infected and un-infected blood fed controls were collected at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi, for a total of eighteen libraries. srnas up to about  <dig> nts in length were isolated from total rna and deep sequenced using sequencing-by-ligation. library sequences were aligned sequentially to the ae. aegypti published transcriptome, . using this approach, we identified reads mapping to published mrnas, small non-coding rnas, novel mrnas and the viral genome. small non-coding rnas, such as trnas and small nuclear rnas, included in the published aedine transcriptome were also analyzed, because recent evidence indicates that they may be regulated by rnai-dependent mechanisms  <cit> .

virna reads aligning to the denv <dig> jam <dig> genome represented  <dig> %-  <dig> % of total filtered reads over the course of the infection . mapped reads included both sense and anti-sense virnas, and there was replicate-to-replicate variation in the number of mapped virnas . srnas from un-infected controls aligned to the viral genome indicate the level of false positive matches . the distribution and abundance of virna reads changed over the course of infection.  <dig> mean mapped virna reads were identified at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> at  <dig> dpi and ~ <dig>  at  <dig> dpi. at  <dig> dpi, virnas represent rnai-mediated degradation of ingested virus  <cit> . there were slightly fewer 20- <dig> nts virnas than  than 24- <dig> nts virnas  . at  <dig> dpi, very few virnas were seen. this result was unexpected, because full-length viral genomes have been observed in midguts at this time period  <cit> . the size distribution among 20- <dig> nt and 24- <dig> nt srna size groups was 55% and 26%, respectively. by  <dig> dpi, virnas were most abundant and represented about  <dig> % of total library reads; 71% and 9% have lengths of 20- <dig> nts and 24- <dig> nts, respectively. virnas of  <dig> to  <dig> nts from a representative library show a slight g/c bias in base composition at the 3' end and a slight bias for 'a's along the length of the srna . endo-sirnas  from drosophilids show a similar bias  <cit> . however, sense strand virnas of 24- <dig> nts showed no preference for a 'u' at the 5' end and only a slight bias for 'a' near position  <dig>  as reported elsewhere  <cit> . although host-derived pirnas are expected to have a preference for an 'a' at position  <dig>  this feature is not always seen in virnas of 24- <dig> nts  <cit> . we asked whether the lack of a u at the 5' end was an artifact of read alignment by looking at all the bases immediately 5' to the matched read, as well as immediately 3' to the 5' end. we found no preference for a u in either case . further, there is no primer sequence at the 5' end of srna sequenced reads in the solid platform. we asked whether the lack of a 5' u could be unique to ae. aegypti by looking at mosquito-derived sindbis virus virnas generated by illumina sequencing and analyzed using nextgene software. in this case, a preference for a u at the 5' end of positive sense virnas of 24- <dig> nts was observed . therefore, the lack of a predicted 'u' at the 5' end of virnas in the current data set is either unique to denv infection but not sinv infection or a previously unreported artifact of the illumina or solid platforms.

host srna profiles
to identify host factors that are differentially regulated by srrps during denv <dig> infection, we asked whether srna profiles mapping to host rnas change in denv2-infected mosquitoes compared to un-infected controls. srna profiles were categorized by the target rna to which they mapped, as well as by srna size group. changes to ncrnas were also measured, because recent evidence suggests that they are regulated by rnai pathway activity  <cit> . for this line of inquiry, we did not distinguish between 20- <dig> nt sirnas, endo-sirnas, or micrornas. we reason that enriched srna profiles for a given target represent the product of enhanced target cleavage, in the absence of concomitant transcriptional repression or mrna decay  <cit> . conversely, depleted srna profiles among the denv2-infected pools would be indicative of fewer degraded mrnas. we defined a single srna profile as the number of reads mapped to a single target transcript. the presence of srnas aligning to a given transcript would be expected to change sporadically across the three biological replicates if they arose through non-specific decay events. moreover, non-specific decay events should produce srnas across all size groups in similar frequency. therefore, we expect that srna levels with statistically significant enrichment or depletion represent altered rnai pathway activity.

the rna-seq program edger was used determine the significance of srna profile enrichment or depletion for sense and anti-sense srnas across all three replicates for each timepoint  <cit> . sense strand reads were more abundant than anti-sense reads. all target transcripts are categorized by read orientation in additional file  <dig>  a cut-off value of  <dig>  false discovery rate  was used to determine whether changes were statistically significant  <cit> . srna populations mapping to mrnas and ncrnas were grouped into functionally similar categories. figure  <dig> shows functional categories for which srna profiles were modulated over the course of infection. at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> unique targets showed enriched srna profiles compared to controls, whereas at  <dig> dpi, only  <dig> targets had significantly enriched srna profiles . under-represented srna profiles were much less abundant;  <dig> unique targets showed depleted srnas in denv2-infected mosquitoes at  <dig> dpi, and  <dig> targets showed depleted srnas at  <dig> dpi . very few differentially abundant profiles were observed at  <dig> dpi, therefore they were excluded from further analysis .

 <dig> dpi srna profiles presented in figures 3a and 3b were distributed by srna size group and presented in figures 3c and 3d. srnas were required to maintain statistically significant enrichment  or depletion  within their particular size group. at  <dig> dpi, srnas mapped to targets of mitochondrial function , transcription and translation , as well as ncrnas, i.e. trnas and u rnas, are the most abundant of all srnas in the 24- <dig> nt size range . the srnas from figure 3c were analyzed to determine whether 12- <dig> nt usrnas, 20- <dig> nt srnas, or 24- <dig> nt pirnas might be modulated simultaneously for the same target. additional file  <dig> depicts the number of targets that share multiple srna size classes at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi.

quantitative rt-pcr was used on an independent biological replicate to test our hypothesis that srna profiles of host genes would be inversely proportional to mrna levels, and thus are indicators of rnai-dependent mrna degradation. most changes to gene expression at the early timepoints should occur in infected midguts. eleven of thirteen selected rna targets, sampled at  <dig> dpi, showed the expected inverse relationship at the timepoint at which srna profiles changes were observed .

discussion
we used deep sequencing of multiple biological replicates to characterize denv2-derived virnas. we showed that the pattern of virna production changes dramatically over the course of infection and that a functional rnai pathway is not sufficient to clear denv <dig> infection in ae. aegypti. the presence of sense and anti-sense virnas at  <dig> dpi indicates that denv <dig> has initiated replication by this time period and the nascent viral genomes are accessible to rnai pathway activity. however, by  <dig> dpi, mean mapped reads have dropped by half. because a previous study showed evidence of full-length viral genomes at  <dig> dpi, we speculate that viral genomes are protected from rnai-mediated degradation  <cit> . this time period also marks the prelude to expanded virus infection in the midgut prior to dissemination and therefore could be a critical window wherein the vector competence phenotype is determined for a given individual. moreover, early host responses may determine whether a persistent virus infection will be established in susceptible mosquitoes or, alternatively, cleared in resistant individuals. our host srna profile data support this hypothesis. significant differences in srna profiles across mosquito pools are most pronounced at  <dig> dpi, lessened at  <dig> dpi and not detectable by  <dig> dpi. this could be due to increasingly individualized host responses as the infection progresses.

this is the first demonstration that virnas of 24- <dig> nts are a product of arbovirus infection using a natural vector/virus combination and important supportive evidence that the pirna pathway plays a role in anti-viral defense in mosquitoes, as has been postulated previously  <cit> . virnas are most abundant in the 24- <dig> nt size group at  <dig> dpi. as infection progresses, the virna size range is altered, until at  <dig> dpi, the predominant population of virnas are from 20- <dig> nts, indicative of a dominant dicer2-dependent rnai response.

we show that high molecular weight complexes containing ago <dig> are present in cells of the mosquito's open circulatory system prior to infection. this is the first evidence from mosquitoes showing the presence of these high molecular weight complexes. multiple anti-ago <dig> antibody cross-reacting bands are present in whole mosquitoes, suggesting that several ago <dig> isoforms are present  <cit> . the  <dig> kda ago <dig> protein previously identified in mosquito midguts was not seen in ips of whole mosquitoes  <cit> , likely because of preferential binding of smaller molecular weight products. moreover, a  <dig> kda alternate spliceform has been identified and could be represented in the  <dig> kda ip band . we also immunoprecipitated 20- <dig> nt srnas and usrnas  from aedine mosquitoes using anti-ago <dig> antibody. the presence of the usrna size class adds to the complexity of possible regulatory control mediated by ago <dig>  gene expression of anti-viral rnai components is enhanced early in denv <dig> infection, in contrast to alphavirus infection, which does not produce significant alteration to either ago <dig> or dicer- <dig> transcript levels  <cit> .

total transcriptome-mapped reads grouped by srna size group show an overall increase in 24- <dig> nt size group in denv-infected libraries ; although this result is not statistically significant, a similar result was also observed in west nile virus-infected culex pipiens quinquefasciatus . virus-derived usrnas were also observed, however it is unclear the role these srnas play in the infection process.

host factor analysis relied on statistically significant differences in srna profiles of denv2-infected mosquitoes across three biological replicates. srnas were mapped unambiguously to target mrnas on the published aedine transcriptome. if mapped srnas were the result of mrna decay by rnai-independent mechanisms, we would expect their profiles to change sporadically across the independent replicates and thus be removed during statistical analysis.

srna count data for each target was compared between denv2-infected pools and those of blood-fed controls. changes to host srna profiles were observed at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi but not at  <dig> dpi. analysis of target functional groups indicates that mrnas coding for transcription/translation, transport, cytoskeletal or structural components, and mitochondrial functional processes, especially oxidative phosphorylation and oxidation/reduction are differentially degraded by rnai pathways during denv <dig> infection. these processes have all been previously identified as being important to flavivirus entry, replication and dissemination  <cit> . viruses must usurp canonical host pathways in order to replicate and establish persistent infections in host mosquitoes. therefore, these gene expression changes could represent a generalized stress response, bonafide host anti-viral responses or virus manipulation of host processes to facilitate infection. although further study will be required to tease apart these subtle differences, our data demonstrates that srrps are altered early during the course of denv <dig> infection.

mitochondrial targets were among the functional groups significantly affected in  <dig> dpi denv2-infected samples. the 20- <dig> nt srna size class was the most common size class acting on mitochondrial target mrnas. targets involved in atp production and other aspects of oxidative phosphorylation were especially affected. key targets are located in respiratory complexes i and iii . similar targets have also been identified in human cells infected with denv <dig>  <cit> . the modulation of mitochondrial targets in denv2-infected mosquitoes suggests that mitochondria may be stressed during infection, and the host is regulating gene expression to respond to this stress. denv <dig> infections are characterized by membrane proliferation in both mammalian and mosquito cells; these membranes are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . perhaps mitochondrial stress stems from the increased energy load required to re-organize intracellular membranes and support denv <dig> infection.

small non-coding rnas , such as trnas and small nucleolar rnas , are cleaved by dicer-dependent mechanisms  <cit> . changes to trna and other ncrna levels could be one mechanism used by hosts in anti-viral defense to slow viral replication. this is supported by the observation that codon usage bias differs among mosquitoes and flaviviruses  <cit> . distinct subsets of trna and u spliceosomal ncrnas are affected during denv infection . further study is needed to determine the mechanisms by which ncrna pattern changes would affect denv replication.

CONCLUSIONS
together, these data indicate that profound changes occur in mosquito metabolic pathways early in the denv2-infection process. mosquitoes use srrps in multiple lines of defense against arboviruses but remain unable to prevent persistent infections. the important features of the denv2-infection process described here provide a context for future studies to define cell autonomous host responses to arbovirus infection in vector mosquitoes.
