BACKGROUND
the tasmanian devil , an endemic species on the island state of tasmania, australia, is the largest remaining carnivorous marsupial in the world  <cit> . tasmanian devils  were found on mainland australia up to  <dig>  to  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . the tasmanian population has been isolated for over  <dig>  years and has undergone two population crashes, due to the current disease epidemic and in around  <dig>  <cit> . as a result, the devil population has an overall low level of genetic diversity  <cit> . currently, the devil faces extinction due to the emergence of a fatal contagious cancer - devil facial tumour disease . dftd was first detected in  <dig> at mt william national park in the northeast of tasmania   <cit> . since then, it has rapidly spread south and westwards to over 85% of the original devil distributional range and caused severe population declines  <cit> . research has revealed that dftd is a clonal cell line, likely of schwann cell origin, which is transmitted between individuals as an allograft by cellular inoculation   <cit> . the "grafted" tumour cells can overcome immunological barriers of the host and adapt in unrelated individuals without inducing immune rejection  <cit> . the low level of genetic diversity at the major histocompatibility complex  is believed to have contributed to this process  <cit> .

the mhc is one of the most studied gene regions in vertebrates due to its critical roles in disease resistance and transplantation success. mhc genes have been cloned and characterized from representatives of all vertebrate classes except agnathan fish  <cit> . based on the structure and function of their encoded proteins, mhc genes are grouped into three classes   <cit> . class i and ii genes are further classified by function as classical and nonclassical, with classical class i and ii genes encoding cell surface molecules that present antigens to t lymphocytes  <cit> . the mhc class i genes are encoded by an α chain, which associates with a β2-microglobulin chain to become a functional class i molecule  <cit> . classical class i  molecules are ubiquitously expressed in all tissue types and function in the recognition and destruction of foreign, virus-infected or malignant cells by cytotoxic t cells  <cit> . nonclassical class i  genes encode class i-like molecules with varied functions, and generally exhibit lower expression levels, tissue specific expression and/or lower levels of polymorphism  <cit> . mhc class ii molecules are heterodimers of an α chain and a β chain, both of which are encoded in the mhc. they are expressed in cells participating in immune responses such as b lymphocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages. these molecules present antigens derived from intravesicular and extracellular pathogens to cd <dig> helper t cells, which release signals to trigger antibody production and inflammatory responses that kill the pathogens  <cit> . in most species, there are multiple closely related mhc gene paralogues, which result from gene duplication events during the evolution of mhc  <cit> . due to selective pressures from ever-changing pathogens in the environment, these antigen-presenting mhc genes evolve rapidly and are usually highly polymorphic in their peptide-binding regions , enabling the immune system to recognize an extensive range of pathogenic antigens  <cit> .

previously, we isolated and characterized devil mhc class i and class ii β chain transcripts  <cit>  and demonstrated low levels of genetic variation in these sequences, especially in eastern tasmania  <cit> . in the northwest, a slightly higher level of diversity was observed using single-strand conformation polymorphism  typing, while sequencing revealed variation in class i allelic numbers in different individuals  <cit> , but due to the inherent difficulties in studying the mhc in non-model species, we were not able to rule out null alleles or experimental artefacts. here we describe the mhc class i and class ii regions of the tasmanian devil based on the construction of bac contigs. we confirm that variation in the number of class i genes occurs due to a deletion within a class ia locus.

RESULTS
characterization of mhc regions
the mhc regions of two individuals were characterized. cedric, whose parents came from dftd-free northwestern tasmania , produced an antibody response when injected with irradiated dftd cells  and at the beginning of the project was thought to be a "resistant" animal because he did not develop dftd following a disease challenge. since then cedric has succumbed to dftd, but remains one of very few animals to be able to mount an antibody response to dftd. the other individual, named spirit, was originally from bangor  and was euthanized in  <dig> due to multiple dftd lesions and metastases to the lungs.

four genomic regions of approximately  <dig> kb in length were assembled and annotated based on ten fully sequenced bac clones  .  <dig> genes and pseudogenes were predicted, comprising five class i genes, four class ii genes, four antigen-processing genes, eight class iii genes and thirteen other genes and pseudogenes. genbank accession numbers of the bac clones and coordinates of the predicted genes are shown in table  <dig>  the annotated genes were mostly named after their orthologues in the human with the exceptions of mhc class i and ii genes, which were given species-specific names based on the nomenclature proposed by klein and colleagues  <cit>  and their evolutionary relationships with previously characterized marsupial genes  <cit> .

genes in the bac overlapping regions are only shown once. letters c and s in bac clone names indicate cedric's and spirit's library, respectively

two of the analysed regions contain class i genes  and the other two contain class ii  . all four regions were physically mapped to the same area on devil chromosome 4q, indicating the genomic location of the devil mhc . based on comparisons to the mhc of the grey short-tailed opossum  and the tammar wallaby , region  <dig> is likely located between region  <dig> and region  <dig>  which encompasses a suite of well-conserved class iii genes . in region  <dig>  class i saha-ud is flanked by five non-mhc genes usp <dig>  tomm <dig>  prickle <dig>  frs <dig> and pgc, which are found ~ <dig> mb proximal from the mhc in human and ~ <dig> mb distal from the mhc in opossum; however, according to fish mapping result, these genes are closer to the mhc in the devil than in opossum .

class i genes
a total of five class i genes were identified and named saha-ua, ub, uc, ud and uk. except saha-ud, they are all closely linked  and are localised with psmb <dig>  psmb <dig>  tap <dig> and tap <dig> genes, which are involved in antigen processing and transportation. saha-ua, ub, uc and ud have evolved from recent gene duplications in the devil lineage  and are not orthologous to class i genes in the opossum or the tammar wallaby. saha-uk is orthologous to modo-uk in the opossum and maeu-uk in the tammar wallaby , both of which have been suggested to be nonclassical genes  <cit> .

the genomic data allowed us to assign mhc alleles to loci using phylogenetics . table  <dig> describes the alleles sequenced on each of the two haplotypes, and by deduction the alleles found on the un-sequenced haplotypes of cedric and spirit. we were able to resolve that previously isolated devil class i sequence variants sahai* <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> belong to locus saha-uc, ua, ub and ud, respectively. meanwhile, five novel alleles, named sahai* <dig> -  <dig>  were found and assigned to genes. alleles from saha-ud, which were previously called group  <dig> alleles  <cit> , are divergent from other genes and form a discrete phylogenetic clade with 94% bootstrap support. saha-ua, ub and uc are closely related, with ua and ub alleles interspersed within the same clade. at nucleotide level, the sequence identity between these three genes is extremely high , with saha-ua and ub sharing up to 99% nucleotide identity in their introns .

the sequence  <dig> bp upstream of the translation start sites was searched for gene regulatory elements, as promoters of mhc class i genes in mammals are mostly contained within this range  <cit> . in saha-ua, ub and uc, this region is highly similar, with only one single nucleotide variation in the tata sites. putative sites of an enhancer a, an interferon stimulated response element , the s-x-y motifs, caat and tata boxes were identified . saha-ud was not included in the alignment in figure  <dig> due to low sequence identity. compared to saha-ua, ub and uc, regulatory elements including enhancers, isre, s and x motifs are not conserved at this locus, which may indicate different expression or function of this gene.

comparison of two mhc class i haplotypes
the mhc region containing the class ia genes in cedric and spirit  contains three indels. spirit's haplotype has an intact saha-ua gene, whereas cedric's has a deletion  that results in the loss of a large portion  of saha-ua and renders it a pseudogene. furthermore, cedric's haplotype also lacks two other long segments that are present in spirit's, one  lying between the pseudogene and saha-ub, and the other  between saha-ub and saha-uc. further investigation on this genomic region revealed  <dig> putative long interspersed element  segments interspersing the mhc genes , nine of which closely flank  the indels and saha-ua, ub and uc. two of the putative lines are located inside the indels and only found in spirit's haplotype.

a pcr test was developed to detect the presence or absence of the deletion in saha-ua in devils. haplotypes without the deletion generate a single band of  <dig> bp in size, which contains amplicons from saha-ua, ub and uc genes. a second band  is generated when a haplotype contains the deletion in saha-ua, representing an amplicon from only the pseudogene, which has arisen due to the deletion .

population study
the frequency of the saha-ua deletion was assessed in samples from seven geographic areas across tasmania .  <dig> individuals were investigated:  <dig> from dftd-affected areas in eastern tasmania ;  <dig> from west pencil pine, an area on the disease front; and  <dig> from the dftd-free northwestern coast region. the deletion is most prevalent in the northwest , followed by west pencil pine , bronte park , narawntapu  and st marys . none of individuals from fentonbury and buckland contained the deletion.

class ii genes
four class ii genes were identified, all belonging to the marsupial class ii da gene family. previously isolated dab transcripts were aligned against the three β chain paralogues and 100% match was found between transcripts sahadab* <dig> , sahadab* <dig>  and sahadab* <dig>  and genes saha-dab <dig>  dab <dig> and dab <dig>  respectively. sequence comparison of these three genes is shown in table  <dig>  saha-dab <dig> and dab <dig> share high nucleotide identity in both exons  and introns . they are both similar to saha-dab <dig> in exon sequences, but differ from it significantly in the introns due to multiple deletions/insertions of nucleotide fragments. in the 5' untranslated region, putative sites of s-x-y motifs are identified in both α and β chain genes, though tata and caat elements are not found in these genes .

discussion
function of mhc genes
based on the genomic characterization of the mhc genes, as well as expression and diversity studies, we are now in the position to assign previously identified mhc alleles to loci and make informed deductions about the likely role of these genes in immune response.

four class ii loci are described in this study, saha-daa, dab <dig>  dab <dig> and dab <dig>  transcripts from the three β chain genes have previously been described  <cit> . these loci likely encode functional antigen-presenting molecules based on homology to other members of the da gene family, which have been studied in a variety of marsupial species . no other class ii gene families have been identified in the devil, indicating that either the devil only has one functional class ii gene family or the other genes are too divergent from known marsupial class ii genes to be detected by the probes.

amongst the five characterized class i loci, we propose that saha-ua, ub and uc are functional class ia genes on the basis of three facts. first, their transcripts have been amplified from all tissue types examined so far, including blood, spleen, skin, liver, kidney and dftd cells  <cit> . second, genetic variation, though the level is not high, is present at these loci, particularly in the putative peptide-binding regions . third, promoter elements in the 5' untranslated region are well conserved between these genes and the class ia genes in the opossum and the tammar wallaby  <cit> , sharing  <dig> % and  <dig> % nucleotide identity respectively. whether the single nucleotide variation in tata box affects the expression level of saha-ua remains uncertain. the number of class ia loci in the devil is comparable to those in the opossum  and the tammar wallaby .

saha-uk has been found transcribed in the blood and spleen and is likely a class ib gene based on orthology with the class ib modo-uk in the opossum and maeu-uk in the tammar wallaby. it has been suggested that the high conservation of this gene over extended evolutionary periods indicates that it may serve a critical, marsupial-specific function  <cit> .

saha-ud, which has been found transcribed in the blood, spleen and dftd cells, shows features of a class ib gene. this locus has significantly lower levels of polymorphism than saha-ua, ub and uc, and its 5' regulatory elements are divergent. within the α <dig> domain, saha-ud alleles share extremely high sequence identity  and only one of the  <dig> putative peptide-binding amino acid residues is polymorphic . elucidation of the functional role of saha-ud in the devil remains to be determined.

genomic characterization allowed us to assign previously characterized "group 1" alleles to class ia loci saha-ua, ub and uc, and "group 2" alleles to saha-ud . the previous description of individuals containing only "group 1" or "group 2" alleles  <cit>  was likely due to experimental artefact caused by nucleotide mismatches  within the pcr primer hybridisation sites. here, we propose that class ia loci saha-ub and uc are likely present in all devils, whereas saha-ua is lost in certain haplotypes. we suggest that in future studies new primers should be designed for saha-ud and the three class ia genes separately to ensure high primer efficiency.

copy number variations  in the mhc
a genomic cnv is a duplication or deletion of a genomic segment larger than  <dig> kb in size  <cit> . in addition to single nucleotide polymorphisms, cnvs represent a major class of genetic variation and are widespread in the human genome  <cit> . large-scale genome-wide disease association studies have revealed a number of cnvs in the hla that are associated with crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> .

when we first proposed the hypothesis of "class i gene copy number variation" in the devil, we were referring to the concept of cnv in a narrow sense, namely variation in the number of class i loci  <cit> . with the new findings from this study, it is necessary to expand the concept to take into account other cnvs of non-coding sequences lying within the devil mhc.

three genomic copy number variants that intersperse with the mhc class ia genes were identified between cedric's and spirit's haplotypes. the one within saha-ua is convincingly a deletion, while the other two are difficult to classify as either duplications or deletions. the loss of functional class i genes due to cnvs is not specific to the devil. a case has been reported for a human haplotype where a  <dig> kb deletion turns hla-a into a pseudogene  <cit> . the mechanisms underlying the generation of these cnvs in the devil mhc are not clear, though a possible explanation may be implied from the presence of the putative line fragments in the affected regions encompassing the three cnvs and saha-ua, ub and uc genes . these retrotransposons may play a role in causing the cnvs as evidence has been found in primate genomes that lines are centrally involved in the generation of cnvs and can mediate deletions up to  <dig> kb in size  <cit> .

the higher frequency of the saha-ua deletion in the northwest may indicate that the eastern and western populations have been exposed to different selective pressures. it is tempting to continue to speculate that the deletion of saha-ua, which was found in cedric and occurs in high frequency in the northwest of tasmania, may provide animals with some level of resilience to dftd. this is consistent with the observation that the spread of dftd is slowing down as the disease front reaches genetically disparate populations in the northwest and that the incidence of disease in these populations is much lower than in similar populations in the east  <cit> . this gene deletion may be advantageous for the following reasons. first, the loss of saha-ua may increase the mhc antigenic dissimilarity between host and tumour, as a saha-ua allele, sahai* <dig>  has been found to be transcribed in the tumour  <cit> . second, the cnvs may alter the expression level of the adjacent mhc genes by affecting regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers as well as inhibitory elements. in fact, it has been found that cnvs can even influence the expression of genes that are up to  <dig> mb away  <cit> . here we have only looked at two devil mhc haplotypes and have only scratched the surface of the genetic variation that could be present amongst devil genomes. the role of this variation in the varied susceptibility/resistance of devils to dftd needs to be further investigated.

comparison with the opossum and tammar wallaby mhc
previous comparative studies revealed that the mhc of the opossum and the tammar wallaby exhibit distinct features in gene content and organisation  <cit> . sequencing of tasmanian devil mhc regions has provided us a better understanding of the marsupial mhc.

in the tammar wallaby, all class ia genes  are un-linked to the mhc region  <cit> , whereas in the opossum the only confirmed class ia gene  is located within the mhc and close to antigen-processing genes . the organisation of class ia genes in the devil is similar to that of the opossum, with ua, ub and uc adjacent to tap <dig>  tap <dig>  psmb <dig> and psmb <dig>  this indicates that the dispersal of class i genes across the genome in the tammar wallaby is not a common characteristic of the australasian marsupial and has occurred after the divergence of devil and tammar wallaby's common ancestor at ~ <dig> million years before present  <cit> .

four class ii gene families have been characterized in the opossum - da, db, dc and dm  <cit> . da, db and dm have also been identified in the tammar wallaby. the class ii genes have undergone large-scale expansion in the tammar wallaby, resulting in up to  <dig> dab loci  <cit> . however, such an expansion of class ii genes is not seen in the devil, with devils having a single daa and three dab genes. on the contrary, the devil genome may have undergone gene deletions that have lead to loss of the db and dc gene families.

in this study, we have focused on characterizing mhc class ia and ii genes in the devil. future work will involve characterization of the functional roles of the putative class ib genes, as well as genes involved in the antigen processing machinery.

CONCLUSIONS
four tasmanian devil genomic regions containing five mhc class i genes and four mhc class ii genes were characterized by bac based sequencing, which allowed us to assign previously sequenced mhc alleles to loci. we propose that saha-ua, ub and uc are class ia genes, saha-uk is a transcribed class ib gene and the role of saha-ud remains to be determined. the expression of saha-ua, ub and uc may be influenced by three genomic cnvs that are found within or adjacent to these loci. future studies should focus on the role of cnvs in the mhc in susceptibility/resistance of devils to dftd.
