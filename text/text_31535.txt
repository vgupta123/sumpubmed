BACKGROUND
globally, maize  is an important source of food and nutritional security for millions of people in the developing world, especially in sub-saharan africa  and latin america  <cit> . maize is a staple food in many of the ssa countries and is commonly grown by resource poor, small-scale farmers in rural areas. it covers  <dig> million hectares in ssa that produce  <dig> million metric tons  <cit>  but the average maize yield in the region is estimated at  <dig>  tons per hectare, which is about 20%, 37% and 56% of the average maize yield in developed countries, brazil and philippines, respectively  <cit> . several factors, including high frequency of drought stress, scarcity and high cost of irrigation, and farmers’ inability to obtain quality seeds and fertilizers, contribute to such low productivity in the region. given the unpredictable nature of drought and climate variability over years, breeders must develop improved maize hybrids that are able to withstand drought stress without significant yield penalty under optimal rainfall conditions  <cit> . for developing drought tolerant maize, selection can be done directly under water stress, indirectly under well-watered  conditions, or under both optimal and stress conditions  <cit> . however, heritability of grain yield under water stress has been reported to be lower than yield under optimal environments  <cit> . hence, physiologists and breeders have devoted significant efforts in identifying relevant secondary traits correlated to grain yield for indirect selection. these include anthesis silking interval  between male and female flowering and several other morpho-physiological traits  <cit> .

the ability to transfer target genomic regions associated with trait of interest using molecular markers resulted in extensive qtl mapping experiments in most economically important crops. such studies aimed at the identification of molecular markers for marker assisted backcrossing , marker assisted recurrent selection  and qtl cloning  <cit> . using mabc, ribaut and ragot  <cit>  introgressed  <dig> qtl associated with yield components and flowering in maize from a donor parent into a drought susceptible recurrent parent. the authors reported increased grain yield and reduced asi under water-limited conditions. the best mabc progeny outperformed the recurrent parent by two to four times under severe drought conditions, with no yield reduction under optimal conditions. however, drought is a complex trait influenced by genetic background and other environmental factors; thus, relying on a few qtl for mabc is unlikely to create optimally drought tolerant lines for target population of environments. individual drought associated qtl generally explain a very small proportion of the phenotypic variance for grain yield, asi or barrenness. qtl for drought related traits are also often cross-specific and remain undetected in crosses from different genetic backgrounds. most qtl are detected under either drought stress or optimal conditions , and there is no assurance that qtl detected from inbred lines will function in the same manner in hybrids. thus, they must be fully validated in several environmental conditions and hybrid combinations before deployment in a large breeding program.

mars is another marker based breeding technology that seeks to accumulate favorable alleles from several genomic regions within a single population  <cit> . in maize, the mars protocol involves  development and evaluation of testcross performance of bi-parental populations in multi-location experiments;  genotyping of the f2: <dig> population ;  undertaking an ad hoc significance test to identify a subset of markers that are significantly associated with the target trait; and  one generation  of selection of the best cycle  <dig> families based on phenotypic index derived from testcross performance, followed by 2- <dig> cycles of selection based solely on markers with significant effects  <cit> . currently, the international maize and wheat improvement center , in collaboration with the national agricultural research systems  from  <dig> countries in africa, the international institute of tropical agriculture , the african agricultural technology foundation , the monsanto company, and several regional and national seed companies in africa, is working in large scale projects that aim to develop and disseminate drought tolerant maize for ssa using conventional breeding, mars, and/or transgenic technology. these include the drought tolerant maize for africa  and the water efficient maize for africa  projects. for the mars component of the wema project, cimmyt developed and evaluated  <dig> bi-parental mapping populations, which formed the base for this study. all these populations have been phenotyped with common protocols and genotyped under a common single nucleotide polymorphism  platform.

comparisons among independent qtl mapping projects usually attempt to determine if loci identified in each are the same by comparing the chromosomal position of a common subset of markers across different studies and/or indirectly by comparing each mapping population to a reference map  <cit> . co-localized qtl may not be identical, however, especially when they are associated with large confidence intervals. meta qtl analysis  <cit>  is a better method for combining data from independent studies to detect consensus qtl and to shrink the qtl confidence intervals. meta-analyses have been used in maize, wheat, rice, rapeseed, potato, cotton, soybean, barley, cocoa and apricot  <cit> . in maize, meta qtl  for drought tolerance  <cit> , flowering time  <cit> , grain yield components  <cit> , ear rot resistance  <cit>  and silage quality  <cit>  have been reported. hao and colleagues  <cit>  collected published qtl results and data related to drought tolerance for  <dig> mapping populations from the maizegdb website  and conducted meta-analyses on a total of  <dig> and  <dig> qtl detected under water stressed and well watered conditions, respectively. the authors reported  <dig> consensus mqtl for drought-tolerance related traits under water stress and  <dig> mqtl under well watered conditions. in most qtl meta-analyses published so far  <cit> , authors compiled published linkage maps and qtl results from independent studies using different phenotyping protocols, constructed consensus linkage maps using a subset of markers common to the different studies, and projected mqtl positions and their confidence intervals onto the consensus map. limitations of those studies are caused by the use of different phenotyping protocols, different qtl mapping methods, too few common markers, or by too few populations, causing lower confidence in the mqtl and the delimited intervals. the objectives of the present study were to identify mqtl for grain yield and asi across  <dig> bi-parental maize populations genotyped with a common snp platform and phenotyped with a common protocol in multi-location experiments both under water stressed and well watered environments.

RESULTS
phenotypic distribution, heritability and correlations
the mean phenotypic distribution for gy and asi for all  <dig> bi-parental populations under water stressed and optimum environments was either normal or approximately normal . broad-sense heritability for gy  varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  under water stressed and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  under optimum environments. for asi, heritability under water-stressed and optimum environments varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively . populations with heritability <  <dig>  under stressed  and/or <  <dig>  under optimum  environments were excluded from qtl analysis. in the dataset used for qtl mapping, therefore, broad sense heritability for gy and asi varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  under water stressed and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  under optimum conditions. there was significant but low to moderate negative correlation between gy and asi under stressed  and optimum  conditions .

linkage and consensus mapping
the map length in the population specific linkage maps varied from  <dig> to  <dig> cm, with a mean of  <dig> cm . the total number of mapped snps per population varied from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig> . the average number of snps mapped per chromosome in the population specific maps was  <dig>  . chromosome  <dig> had fewer markers  compared to all other chromosomes due to low marker polymorphism in the initial polymorphism screening between parents . the mean map distance between markers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm and the overall mean across all  <dig> populations was  <dig>  cm. the final consensus map consisted of  <dig> snps with a total map length of  <dig> cm. as shown in figure  <dig>  the number of markers per chromosome in the consensus map ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> snps ; map length per chromosome ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> cm, with a mean of  <dig> cm. the map distance between markers in the final consensus map ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm and the overall mean was  <dig>  cm, which is much smaller than the overall mean distance  of the population specific maps. all except  <dig> intervals had a map distance <  <dig> cm .

qtl in individual populations
from the  <dig> studies, composite interval mapping  uncovered a total of  <dig> qtl for gy and  <dig> qtl for asi . figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the frequency distribution of the qtl for gy and asi by lod score and phenotypic variance explained by each qtl and chromosome. under stressed environments,  <dig> qtl for gy were uncovered  in  <dig> of the  <dig> populations with heritability >  <dig>  . the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by each gy qtl under stress environments varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, and there were between  <dig> and  <dig> qtl per chromosome . the average phenotypic and genotypic variance explained by each gy qtl under stressed environments was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. in the optimum environments, a total of  <dig> qtl for gy were detected across all  <dig> populations. the number of gy qtl per population under optimum environments varied from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>  qtl, and each qtl explained  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. the qtl were distributed across all chromosomes with the number of qtl per chromosome ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  with a mean of  <dig>  qtl. the mean phenotypic and genotypic variance explained by each gy qtl under optimum environments was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

for asi, a total of  <dig> qtl with heritability >  <dig>  were uncovered in  <dig> populations under stressed environments . each qtl for asi explained  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance under water stress, and they were distributed across all chromosomes with each chromosome containing from  <dig> to  <dig> qtl, . the mean phenotypic and genotypic variance explained by each qtl for asi under stress was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. qtl for asi with heritability >  <dig>  were detected in  <dig> of the  <dig> populations under optimum environments, with the number of qtl varying from  <dig> to  <dig> and an average of  <dig>  qtl per population. each qtl for asi explained  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance under optimum environments. the qtl for asi under optimum environments were distributed across all chromosomes with the number of qtl per chromosome ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and an average of  <dig>  per chromosome. the average phenotypic and genotypic variance explained by each qtl for asi under optimum environments was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. several qtl for gy and asi had overlapping confidence intervals, and they appeared in clusters in the linkage maps .

meta-analyses
all qtl identified in individual populations were projected on the consensus map separately for gy and asi first, and then for the combined qtl results of both traits . the analysis of the combined traits increased the number of qtl per chromosome from a range of 4- <dig> to a range of 8- <dig>  the statistical power via single trait-analysis and combined traits analyses was the same . the meta-analysis sharply reduced the total number of qtl from  <dig> to  <dig> mqtl, compared to individual populations . nine of these mqtl were specific to asi,  <dig> to gy, and the remaining  <dig> were common to both gy and asi . table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> present information about each mqtl, including chromosomal position, genetic and physical confidence interval, r <dig>  flanking markers, and number of candidate genes in the interval. eight of the  <dig> mqtl were associated either with asi  or both asi and gy  under water stressed environments only. the other  <dig> mqtl were detected both under stressed and optimum environments and the remaining  <dig> mqtl were associated with gy, asi or both traits under optimum environments only.

see additional file  <dig> for more information.

the number of mqtl identified on each chromosome varied from  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  mqtl per chromosome. the low marker density on chromosome  <dig> may have reduced the number of mqtl uncovered on this chromosome. the mean phenotypic variance explained by each mqtl varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> % and the overall average was  <dig> %. the 95% genetic confidence intervals for the mqtl varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, with an average of  <dig>  cm, which is half the sizes of their respective original qtl . the 95% physical confidence intervals ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb with an average of  <dig>  kb. the total number of candidate genes within the physical intervals varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> candidate genes per mqtl . the physical to genetic distance ratio varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb/cm, and the average was  <dig>  kb/cm.

eighteen of the  <dig> mqtl were detected in only a single population,  <dig> mqtl in  <dig> populations,  <dig> mqtl in  <dig> populations,  <dig> mqtl in  <dig> populations,  <dig> mqtl in  <dig> populations, and  <dig> mqtl in  <dig> populations . no mqtl was detected in more than  <dig> of the  <dig> populations. among the  <dig> mqtl mapped in 4- <dig> populations, four mqtl  were associated with gy under both stress and optimum conditions;  <dig> mqtl  were associated with gy only under optimum conditions; and the remaining  <dig> mqtl  were associated with gy under optimum and asi under water stressed and/or optimum environments. mqtl <dig>  is located on chromosome  <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm and has a physical interval of  <dig> kb. this qtl explains on average  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for gy both under water stress and optimum environments and encompassed  <dig> candidate genes. mqtl <dig>  is located at the proximal end of chromosome  <dig> and has a physical interval of  <dig>  kb; it accounted on average for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for gy both under water stress and optimum environments and encompassed  <dig> candidate genes. mqtl <dig>  is located on chromosome  <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm and has a physical interval of  <dig>  kb; this qtl explains on average  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for gy both under water stress and optimum environments and encompassed  <dig> candidate genes. mqtl <dig>  is located on chromosome  <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm and has a physical interval of  <dig>  kb. the latter mqtl explains on average  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for gy both under water stress and optimum environments and encompassed  <dig> candidate genes.

discussion
the projection of many qtl on a consensus map for meta-analysis allows to ascertain whether the qtl detected under water stressed conditions are a subset of those detected under optimal conditions, and if the qtl are common across different mapping populations . our study clearly demonstrated four times as many mqtl expressed under optimum conditions than under stressed environments. there was lower broad-sense heritability both for gy and asi under stressed  than under optimum  environments, which may be an indication of a larger environmental component to the variance associated with stressed compared to optimum conditions. although heritability under stress is sometimes comparable with heritability under optimum conditions, many studies  <cit>  have also reported lower heritability under water stress than under optimum conditions. the mqtl were very specific to genetic background, but  <dig> of the  <dig> mqtl  found in  <dig> to  <dig> populations had small to medium genetic  and physical  intervals and may be important regions for marker assisted backcrossing, qtl cloning for transformation, and/or functional analysis. four of these mqtl  seem the most suitable for future studies and eventual incorporation into breeding lines because  they were associated with gy under both water stressed and optimum environments;  they were detected up to  <dig> genetic backgrounds;  they accounted on average  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for gy under stress and optimum conditions, and  they encompassed lower number  of candidate genes.

candidate genes can be identified through positional cloning using qtl confidence intervals  <cit> , but confidence intervals need to be as small as possible. combining results from several genome-wide surveys  <cit>  and/or by merging qtl data from different studies  <cit>  can help accomplish this. our results from meta-analysis clearly demonstrated a gain in precision, reaching up to 12-fold smaller confidence interval in the mqtl, as compared with the population specific maps . similar results have been reported in other studies  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  the number of candidate genes within the  <dig> most conserved mqtl associated with gy both under water stressed and optimum environments varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  and will thus require a further shrinking by fine mapping. this can most easily be done by increasing marker density evenly in the target regions, for example via genotyping-by-sequencing , which will generate nearly a million snps per sample at a cost of about $ <dig> to $ <dig> . at least 10% of these snps are expected to be polymorphic between parents in a given cross, and will thus generate at least  <dig> thousand polymorphic snps for fine mapping. the mapping populations presented in this study have been submitted for gbs, which may narrow down the physical confidence interval of the mqtl. further fine mapping and/or qtl validation can also be done by increasing the size of the mapping populations. the four mqtl for gy detected in multiple populations under both stressed and optimum environments were also associated with asi under stress and/or optimum conditions. however, we are unsure if this was due to the pleiotropic action of a single gene or multiple linked genes  <cit> . if the cause is tight linkage of multiple genes, fine mapping of large numbers of recombinants will break up the linkage. although this is a labor and time-consuming process, it will be proposed for the conserved mqtl of large phenotypic effect.

some of the mqtl detected in this study explained up to 13% of the phenotypic variance for gy and asi under stress and/or optimum conditions. because each mapping populations had an average of  <dig> progenies, it is possible that some of the mqtl of large effect may showed upward biased estimation  of the phenotypic effects  <cit> . mqtl with large physical intervals may also contain several linked genes influencing the same trait. this has been reported even in cases where qtl effects have been fine mapped to more than one specific gene  <cit> . as far as we are aware, this is the first study that reports extensive mqtl results using over  <dig> individuals that were genotyped using the same snp platform and phenotyped in the same way across a wide range of managed water stressed and well watered environments. future investigations may involve fine mapping and/or verification of some of the mqtl regions detected across 4- <dig> populations using large population size and high marker density. the results from this study provide highly valuable information for researchers working on qtl mapping for possible use in marker assisted selection and/or qtl cloning.

CONCLUSIONS
meta-analyses reduced the number of qtl by 68% and narrowed the confidence intervals up to 12-fold, but none of the mqtl were detected in more than  <dig> populations, confirming the uniqueness of qtl from different populations. nevertheless, at least  <dig> of the  <dig> mqtl were detected at least in  <dig> populations and may be considered for fine mapping and validation using large population sizes and high marker density, such as gbs. these four mqtl were located on chromosomes  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> . about 65% of the mqtl uncovered under water stressed and/or optimum environments coincided between grain yield and asi but it is unclear whether such large number of coincident mqtl was due to pleiotropic effect or tight linkage.
