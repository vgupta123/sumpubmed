BACKGROUND
alfalfa  has long been cultivated as the most important legume forage crop in the world. the widespread use of alfalfa is due to its high forage quality. alfalfa forage is high in crude protein , but its rumen undegraded protein  content is low. most proteins of alfalfa are degraded in rumen into small n-containing molecules, instead of essential amino acids that are required by animals, subsequently decreasing the utilization value of alfalfa n and consequently releasing to the environment and causing pollutions  <cit> . k, ca, mg, and p are essential minerals to animals, which are involved in various physiological activities regulating metabolisms  <cit> , affecting growth and development, and improving the quality of animal products. for example, an increased concentration of k in diet could reduce trans-fatty acids in milk  <cit> , prevent metabolic alkalosis and decrease the risk of hypocalcemia and milk fever in cows  <cit> . thus, identification of genes that control aforementioned forage quality component traits will provide insights for alfalfa breeding programs.

most quality traits, like cp, rup, and mineral elements, are quantitative traits coded by multiple genes, influenced by environment, and complexed by genotype by environment interaction. traditional linkage mapping is the most common approach to detect quantitative trait loci  conditioning complex traits in plants. to date, several qtl studies in mineral elements have been reported based on linkage mapping investigations in oryza sativa  <cit> , triticum aestivum  <cit> , and brassica napus  <cit> , and zea mays  <cit> . compared with linkage analysis, association mapping is a recently-emerged alternative robust tool to overcome the restriction of classical qtl mapping  <cit> . it has been widely applied in the major crop species to detect qtls by establishing marker-trait associations . recently, huang et al.  <cit> , and nawaz et al.  <cit> , respectively reported marker-trait associations  for mineral elements in rice using association mapping. but for alfalfa, little information is available for the genetic structures in cp, rup and mineral elements, by linkage analysis or association mapping. in the present study, genome wide association  approach was used to investigate ssr markers associated with the six quality traits in a core collection of alfalfa.

RESULTS
phenotypic variations in an alfalfa association mapping population
the six measured traits for  <dig> alfalfa genotypes are given in table  <dig>  the average values of crude protein  and ca were slightly increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  while k and mg were just the opposite . all the datasets showed normal or nearly normal distributions . the anova results indicated that all the traits were significantly influenced by genotype, environment and genotype × environment interaction  . for genotype, the most notable effect was detected in ca  and the smallest in rup  . the most significant environment and genotype × environment effects were both observed in rumen undegraded protein , while the slightest in mg and k . the results indicated sufficient genetic variability existed in the alfalfa collection that was appropriate for the association mapping research. interestingly, pearson’s phenotypic correlation coefficients were highly significant between the traits  . among  <dig> pairs of the six traits, eight pairs showed positive correlations while the remaining seven pairs appeared to be negatively correlated .table  <dig> phenotypic variation for six quality traits in alfalfa in 3 years

association analysis
to control false positive trait-marker associations, three models, namely general linear model , q, and q + k, were compared with each other using the quantile-quantile  plot shown in fig.  <dig>  in general, the p value obtained from the q + k model was more close to the expected p value than the other two models . using the respective mean phenotyping values of the 3 years,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> marker-trait associations  were detected by glm, q, and q + k model, respectively . the result showed that the false positives were appropriately controlled by using the q + k model. therefore, the following analyses were based on the q + k model.fig.  <dig> qq plot of observed versus expected p – values using three different models for six traits. the glm naive , glm q-model  and mlm

based on the q + k model, a total of  <dig> mtas, respectively,  <dig> in  <dig>   <dig> in  <dig> and  <dig> in  <dig>  were detected significantly for the six measured traits with  <dig> ssr markers in at least 1 year . for cp, three, two and eight mtas were significant in 3 years, respectively, with the explained phenotypic variance  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . for rup, six, four, and two mtas were identified to be significant in 3 years, respectively, with the r <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. for ca, eight, six, and ten significant mtas were detected in 3 years, respectively, with the r <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. for k, four, zero, and two mtas were significant in 3 years, respectively, with the r <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. for mg, three, zero, and nine mtas were detected in 3 years, respectively, with the r <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. for p, six, five, and seven mtas were detected in 3 years, respectively, with the r <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig> %.

among the  <dig> mtas, most were detected only in 1 year for cp, rup, k, mg, and p except those for ca. five mtas with ca were repeatedly observed in 2 years. the alleles, m215_ <dig> and m583_ <dig>  which located in chromosome one, were respectively detected in  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig>  the alleles, m13_ <dig> and m13_ <dig>  which located in chromosome two, were detected in  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the allele m429_ <dig> located in chromosome four was detected in  <dig> and  <dig> .

among these associated alleles, some alleles were found associated with multiple traits especially in  <dig>  five alleles, m13_ <dig>  m19_ <dig>  m350_ <dig>  m429_ <dig> and m53_ <dig>  co-associated with ca and mg in  <dig>  and the other three alleles m19_ <dig>  m359_ <dig> and m46_ <dig> co-associated with cp and p in  <dig> . one allele, m630_ <dig> was co-associated with k and mg in  <dig>  and m225_ <dig> co-associated with ca and p in  <dig>  the significant associations of the same alleles with multiple traits might be the result of pleiotropy.

mining of elite alleles
the phenotypic effect of each allele that significantly associated with each of the six traits was shown in additional file  <dig>  in this study, the alleles with positive effects are considered to be elite alleles for all the six measured traits. among the  <dig> alleles associated with cp,  <dig> showed positive effects. the allele m257_ <dig> had the most positive phenotypic effect  in  <dig>  for rup, five alleles had positive effects and allele m83_ <dig> had the most positive phenotypic effect  in  <dig>  only one allele m520_ <dig> showed a positive effect  associated with k. the allele m630_ <dig> had the most positive phenotypic effect  in  <dig> among the  <dig> alleles associated with mg. the allele m225_ <dig> had the most positive phenotypic effect  associated with p in  <dig>  however almost all of elite alleles mentioned above were only associated in 1 year. the m13_ <dig> was only one that stably associated with ca over different years although it has small positive effect .

discussion
in this study, alfalfa genotypes showed significant levels of genetic diversity , as revealed by anova of all the six traits, and the most traits were highly heritable, showing a broad variation among the alfalfa genotypes . all the traits were significantly influenced by environment and genotype × environment interactions. two important environment factors, precipitation and temperature, were investigated during the 3 years . there was no any significant difference on the temperature during the 3 years. whereas, some significant difference was observed for precipitation especially in april and may among 3 years which was the important development stage of the alfalfa. obviously, the precipitation is the main factor leading to environmental variance and ultimately affect the six quality traits in the study. correlation analysis of different traits is considered very useful in exploring interrelationships. in the present study, numerous significant correlations were observed between the six different traits . these correlations may be due to the impact of a single gene on multiple traits or co-association of physically closely located genes  <cit> .

association mapping is a reliable method for quickly identifying the loci responsible for natural variants in a target phenotype  <cit> . recently, association mapping was also used to identify loci associated with the biomass yield and stem composition  <cit> , and verticillium wilt resistance  <cit>  in tetraploid alfalfa and forage yield and nutritive value in diploid alfalfa  <cit> . however, less information is known about the association of ssr loci with crude protein, rup, and mineral elements in plant species. huang et al.  <cit>  reported a total of  <dig> marker-trait associations identified for the five mineral elements in rice. nawaz et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> marker loci associated with eight grain elemental concentrations in brown rice. the present study is the first attempt in characterizing the alfalfa genotypes using genomic ssr markers for crude protein, rup, and four mineral elements in a diverse set of worldwide collection of alfalfa accessions. a total of  <dig> mtas was identified as associated with measured traits based on the association analysis using the mlm model . most of the loci associated with the six traits were identified only in a specific year, suggesting their expression for these traits is significantly influenced by the environment. however, stable associations with ca were identified in our study, such as the alleles m215_ <dig> and m583_ <dig> located in chromosome one, m13_ <dig> and m13_ <dig> located in chromosome two, m429_ <dig> in chromosome four . therefore, these associated markers and identified genotypes with favorable alleles could be used for marker assisted selection in alfalfa breeding after validation.

it is reported that co-localized or pleiotropic associations may be helpful to reveal some important genomic regions or genes for the desirable traits  <cit> . in this study, several co-localized associations were detected. for example, m13_ <dig> was found associated with ca, and mg in chromosome two, suggesting that it may be possible to select for high ca, and mg lines using molecular markers in these regions . m19_ <dig> was found associated with crude protein and p in chromosome two, indicating that it may be possible to select for high crude protein and p lines . similar results were reported in rice  <cit> , aegilops tauschii  <cit> , and festuca arundinacea  <cit> . furthermore, the markers associated with more than one trait may be effectively used of improving more than one trait in marker assisted selection. the phenomenon of co-localization may be caused by pleiotropy of the same gene involved in the metabolism and physiological processes of several elements or is the presence of clustered genes that are tightly linked responsible for the accumulation of different elements in rice grain  <cit> .

because of the complex nature of the studied traits and limited markers used, most of the experimental results showed poor repeatability and lower explained phenotypic variance  as indicated by the similar research  <cit>  . but some of elite alleles were still detected associated with the studies traits. these will be useful for molecular marker assist selection breeding in alfalfa compared to traditional phenotype-based selection.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study is the first attempt in characterizing the alfalfa genotypes using genomic ssr markers for cp, rup, and four mineral elements  traits in a diverse set of worldwide collection of alfalfa accessions. our results showed that this alfalfa association panel could be appropriate for association analyses targeting complex agronomics traits with optimal association models. the markers associated to the qtls in the study could be effectively used in improving locally well adapted germplasm by marker assisted introgression of desirable alleles.
