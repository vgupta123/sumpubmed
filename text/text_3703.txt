BACKGROUND
ligand stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor  and the three other members of the egfr family of receptor tyrosine kinases  results in tyrosine autophosphorylation, recruitment of signaling proteins, and activation of distinct complement of signaling pathways that regulate a great variety of cellular responses  <cit> .

one of the signaling pathways that is activated by the egfr is the phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase /akt anti-apoptic signaling pathway  <cit> . the pi- <dig> kinase holoenzyme consists of a regulatory subunit  and a catalytic p <dig> subunit. the regulatory subunit contains two sh <dig> domains that bind specifically to pyxxm motifs in a variety of cellular proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases such as the pdgf  receptor, and c-kit and docking proteins such as irs   <dig>  irs <dig> and gab <dig>  although the cytoplasmic domain of the egfr does not contain any canonical p <dig> binding motifs, egf stimulation leads to pi- <dig> kinase activation by an indirect mechanism. it has been proposed that the pi- <dig> kinase is activated in response to egf stimulation as a consequence of formation of egfr/erbb <dig> heterodimers  <cit> . unlike egfr, the cytoplasmic region of erbb <dig> contains at least six pyxxm motifs  <cit> . indeed, egf stimulation of cells co-expressing the egfr and erbb <dig> results in recruitment and activation of pi- <dig> kinase by tyrosine phosphorylated erbb <dig>  <cit> .

egf stimulation of pi- <dig> kinase may also be mediated by the docking protein gab <dig> . egf stimulation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of gab <dig> enabling recruitment and activation of pi- <dig> kinase by the three canonical pyxxm motifs on gab <dig>  <cit> . gab <dig> was originally identified as a grb <dig> binding protein, and was shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to treatment with a variety of growth factors  <cit> . gab <dig> contains a number of tyrosine residues that could serve as potential binding sites for the sh <dig> domain containing proteins grb <dig>  pi- <dig> kinase, and the protein tyrosine phosphatase shp <dig>  <cit> . while there have been reports that gab <dig> binds directly to the egfr via an 83-amino acid stretch termed the met-binding-domain or mbd  <cit> , the majority of gab <dig> is believed to be indirectly associated with the egfr via the adaptor protein grb <dig>  which binds to a proline rich region on gab <dig> via its c-terminal sh <dig> domain  <cit> .

cells over-expressing a mutant gab <dig> protein containing tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at the three p <dig> binding sites have been shown to be defective in egf-induced jnk activation, and treatment of cells over-expressing wild type gab <dig> with pi- <dig> kinase inhibitors interferes with mapk signaling in response to egf treatment, thus revealing a link between gab <dig> and pi- <dig> kinase in egf-induced mitogenic signaling  <cit> . furthermore, the pi- <dig> kinase product phosphatidylinositol  triphosphate  has been shown to bind to the pleckstrin homology  domain of gab <dig> resulting in membrane-association of gab <dig>  suggesting a positive feedback loop in which pi- <dig> kinase acts as both an upstream regulator and a downstream effector of gab <dig> signaling via the egfr  <cit> . gab <dig> thus acts as a docking protein facilitating the recruitment of a multi-protein signaling complex including the egfr, p <dig> and shp <dig> in response to egf treatment.

although the role of the shp <dig> protein in the control of egfr/gab <dig> interactions is not well understood, several studies have suggested that gab1-associated shp <dig> may influence egf-induced pi- <dig> kinase signaling. previous work has shown that gab <dig> is not a global substrate of shp <dig>  as complex formation between gab <dig> and shp <dig> does not reduce the total egf-induced tyrosine phosphorylation levels of gab <dig>  <cit> . however there have been several reports suggesting that shp <dig> may specifically de-phosphorylate the tyrosine phosphorylation sites on gab <dig> that bind to p <dig>  thus terminating recruitment of pi- <dig> kinase and egf-induced activation of the pi- <dig> kinase pathway  <cit> . it has been shown that cells devoid of shp <dig> show an increase in pi- <dig> kinase activity, as well as elevated and sustained levels of akt activation in response to egf treatment  <cit> . it was reported that treatment of cells with pi- <dig> kinase inhibitors or with the phosphatidylinositol  triphosphate  phosphatase pten interferes with the association between gab <dig> and shp <dig> in response to egf treatment, suggesting pi- <dig> kinase may be required for shp <dig> recruitment of gab <dig> following egf stimulation  <cit> . however, the mechanism for this postulated recruitment is unknown.

in the experiments presented here we utilized fibroblasts isolated from gab1-/- mouse embryos in order to examine the role of gab <dig> in egf-mediated activation of the pi- <dig> kinase/akt cell survival pathway. we also address the question of whether erbb <dig> recruitment of pi- <dig> kinase is dependent on or independent of gab <dig>  our results demonstrate a clear requirement for gab <dig> in recruitment and activation of pi- <dig> kinase in response to egf stimulation. additionally, we show that while shp <dig> does not mediate global dephosphorylation of gab <dig>  it does appear to negatively regulate the egf-induced activation of pi- <dig> kinase through an undefined mechanism. finally we demonstrate that erbb <dig> is capable of recruiting pi- <dig> kinase in the absence of gab <dig>  but gab <dig> functions as the major mediator of pi- <dig> kinase activation in response to egf stimulation.

RESULTS
previous studies have suggested that erbb <dig> and gab <dig> can function as links between egfr and pi- <dig> kinase. in this report we use mefs derived from gab <dig> -/- embryos  <cit>  to explore the contribution of gab <dig> and erbb <dig> to egf stimulation of pi- <dig> kinase and akt in these cells.

gab <dig> is essential for egf stimulation of pi- <dig> kinase and akt
mefs derived from gab1-/- or wild type  embryos were stimulated with egf and assayed for gab <dig> tyrosine phosphorylation, for activation of pi- <dig> kinase and for akt stimulation. as shown in figure 1a, the endogenous gab <dig> present in wt mefs is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to egf treatment. as shown in figure 1b, gab <dig> -/- mefs displayed very low levels of egf-induced pi- <dig> kinase activity relative to cells expressing gab <dig>  we did observe an approximate 2-fold increase in this low-level basal pi- <dig> kinase activity in gab <dig> -/- mefs, which represents a gab1-independent signaling pathway. gab <dig> -/- and wt mefs were additionally stimulated with egf and the activation of akt was analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies which recognize specifically the activated form of akt. as shown in figure 1c , gab <dig> -/- cells display no activation of akt in response to egf, while wt mefs show egf-stimulated akt activation within two minutes of egf treatment.

the cdna encoding the wild type murine gab <dig> sequence was cloned into a retroviral vector, and the virus was used to infect gab <dig> -/- mefs. stable cell lines were selected for co-transduction of a puromycin resistance gene and pools of selected cells were used for further analysis. as shown in figure 1a, the ectopic gab <dig> protein was expressed at slightly lower levels in the gab <dig> -/- mefs relative to endogenous gab <dig> expression seen in the wild type mefs. quantitation by densitometry reveals gab <dig> expression in wild type mefs to be  <dig> -fold higher than ectopic gab <dig> expression in gab <dig> -/- mefs. treatment with egf induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the exogenous gab <dig> protein expressed in the gab <dig> -/- mefs at levels similar to endogenous gab <dig> in wild type mefs. as shown in figure 1b, expression of exogenous gab <dig> in the gab <dig> -/- mefs results in gab1-associated pi- <dig> kinase activity that is augmented following egf treatment. the low level of egf-induced pi- <dig> kinase activity observed in the gab <dig> -/- cells may be due to signaling via an alternate, gab1-independent mechanism. these cells were additionally treated with egf over a period of time and the activation of akt was assayed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the ser <dig> phosphorylated form of akt. the experiment presented in fig 1c shows that ectopic expression of gab <dig> in the gab <dig> deficient cells rescues egf-induced akt activation to levels similar to those observed in egf-treated wild type mefs. taken together, these results demonstrate that gab <dig> is required for egf-stimulation of pi- <dig> kinase and akt.

the canonical p <dig> binding sites on gab <dig> are essential for pi- <dig> kinase and akt activation in response to egf stimulation
the cdna encoding a mutant gab <dig> protein, containing tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutations at the three binding sites for the p <dig> regulatory subunit of pi- <dig> kinase  , was cloned into a retroviral vector and used to generate pools of stable mef cell lines as described above. we first assayed the cells for gab <dig> expression, and for the ability of the mutant gab1f446/472/ <dig> protein to become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to egf treatment. as shown in figure 2a, both wild type gab <dig> and gab1f446/472/ <dig> undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to egf treatment . quantitation of multiple experiments by densitometry reproducibly demonstrates that gab1f446/472/ <dig> is tyrosine phosphorylated following egf treatment to similar levels when normalized for gab <dig> expression levels. we next subjected lysates from unstimulated or egf stimulated cells to immunoprecipitation with anti-gab <dig> antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-p <dig> antibodies. as has been demonstrated previously  <cit> , wild type gab <dig> readily coimmunoprecipitated p <dig> following egf treatment, while the gab1f446/472/ <dig> mutant protein failed to show an association with p <dig>  confirming that the gab1f446/472/ <dig> protein is deficient in p <dig> binding. similar levels of gab <dig> expression in these cells were confirmed by reprobing the gab <dig> phosphotyrosine blot with anti-gab <dig> antibodies . additionally, total cell lysates of all gab <dig> expressing cell lines described in this study were subjected to anti-gab <dig> immunoblotting, providing independent evidence for similar levels of gab <dig> expression across all cell lines .

because the substrates of shp <dig> are for the most part unknown, we were additionally interested in examining the state of egfr tyrosine phosphorylation following treatment with egf in order to determine if the failure of gab <dig> to bind p <dig>  and potentially recruit shp <dig>  would influence levels of egfr autophosphorylation. however, stimulation with egf for varying time intervals revealed no significant differences in the levels of autophosphorylation of egfr in cells expressing wild type gab <dig> versus the gab1f446/472/ <dig> mutant . a linear representation of the egf-induced egfr tyrosine phosphorylation following normalization for egfr expression levels is shown in figure 2b . these results are consistent with our finding that p <dig> binding to gab <dig> does not influence the recruitment of shp <dig> to the gab <dig> signaling complex, and are inconsistent with the conclusion that gab <dig> mediates a pi- <dig> kinase-dependent recruitment of shp <dig>  <cit> .

we next explored the role of gab <dig> in egf-induced activation of the pi- <dig> kinase/akt cell survival pathway utilizing the gab1f446/472/589expressing cells. we first assayed the gab1-associated pi- <dig> kinase activity directly through a pi- <dig> kinase assay. as shown in figure 2c, immunoprecipitation of wild type gab <dig> following egf treatment brings down associated pi- <dig> kinase activity. however immunoprecipitation of gab1f446/472/ <dig> is not associated with significant levels of pi- <dig> kinase in the presence or absence of egf stimulation. in order to assay the effects of egf stimulation on signaling downstream of pi- <dig> kinase, gab <dig> -/- mefs expressing no gab <dig>  wild type gab <dig> or gab1f446/472/ <dig> were treated with egf over varying times and cell lysates were immunoblotted for serine-phosphorylated akt. mutation of the p <dig> binding sites on gab <dig> essentially eliminated all egf-induced akt activation relative to cells expressing wild type gab <dig> . the binding of p <dig> is absolutely required for gab1-mediated activation of pi- <dig> kinase and akt following egf treatment  <cit> .

previous work has indicated that treatment of cells with pi- <dig> kinase inhibitors reduces levels of egf-induced complex formation between gab <dig> and the protein tyrosine phosphatase shp <dig>  <cit> . this finding suggests a role for gab <dig> in the pi- <dig> kinase-dependent recruitment of shp <dig> following egf stimulation. we have examined the possibility that mutation of the p <dig> binding sites on gab <dig>  which prevents pi- <dig> kinase activation, altered egf-induced recruitment of shp <dig> as compared to the recruitment of shp <dig> by wild type gab <dig>  for this purpose, lysates from unstimulated or egf-stimulated cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-gab <dig> antibodies following immunoblotting with anti-shp <dig> antibodies. the experiment presented in fig 2a shows that mutation of the p <dig> binding sites on gab <dig> did not affect recruitment of shp <dig> by gab <dig> following egf stimulation . as has been previously observed  <cit> , we noted a low level of basal association between shp <dig> and both gab <dig> and gab1f446/472/ <dig>  which may be due to incomplete growth factor starvation prior to egf stimulation in these experiments.

expression of gab <dig> mutant protein deficient in shp <dig> binding rescues egf-induced pi- <dig> kinase/akt activation in gab <dig> -/- mefs
to assess the role of the protein tyrosine phosphatase shp <dig> in gab1-mediated signaling induced by egf, two gab <dig> mutants were generated and expressed in pools of gab <dig> -/- mefs. the first contained tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutations at the two binding sites for the shp <dig> protein tyrosine phosphatase   and the second contained mutations at the shp <dig> binding sites as well as at the three pi- <dig> kinase binding sites described above . we first assayed the ability of the mutant gab <dig> proteins to become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to egf. as shown in figure 3a  both wild type gab <dig> protein and the gab1f627/ <dig> protein readily undergo tyrosine phosphorylation when stimulated with egf. quantitation following densitometry indicates that gab1f627/ <dig> is reproducibly tyrosine phosphorylated to levels approximately  <dig> -fold higher than gab <dig>  this result suggests that gab <dig> may be a substrate of shp <dig>  and that blocking shp <dig> binding thereby increases egf-induced gab <dig> tyrosine phosphorylation. the gab1f446/472/589/627/ <dig> mutant reproducibly displayed lower levels of tyrosine phosphorylation following treatment with egf suggesting that these five tyrosines are the main phosphorylation sites on gab <dig> 

immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-gab <dig> antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-shp <dig> antibodies demonstrates that wild type gab <dig> forms a complex with shp <dig> following egf treatment, while the gab1f627/ <dig> mutant proteins fail to show an association with shp <dig> thus confirming that phosphorylation of tyr <dig> and  <dig> is required for shp <dig> binding . the basal interaction we observed between gab <dig> and shp <dig> in the absence of egf stimulation  is absent in the gab1f627/ <dig> mutant, even following prolonged exposures of the western blot.

we did not detect a change in the tyrosine phosphorylation of egfr in cells expressing gab <dig> proteins that are deficient in recruitment of shp <dig>  the experiment presented in fig 3b shows cells stimulated with egf over varying periods of time and cell extracts assayed for levels of egfr tyrosine autophosphorylation. as has been previously reported  <cit> , recruitment of shp <dig> by gab <dig> does not alter the magnitude or kinetics of tyrosine autophosphorylation of egfr . levels of egfr autophosphorylation are represented linearly following quantitation by densitometry and normalization for protein expression levels .

previous work with shp <dig> -/- cells demonstrated an elevated and sustained activation of pi- <dig> kinase and akt in response to egf treatment, and it was proposed that shp <dig> may act to dephosphorylate gab <dig> at one or both of the p <dig> binding sites  <cit> . we utilized the gab <dig> proteins deficient in shp <dig> binding to assay more directly the role of the shp2-gab <dig> complex in mediating activation of pi- <dig> kinase and akt in response to egf stimulation. as shown in figure 3c, immunoprecipitation of gab1f627/ <dig> brings down  <dig> -fold higher basal levels of pi- <dig> kinase activity relative to wild type gab <dig> as assayed by pip <dig> production. importantly, gab <dig> mutants defective for shp <dig> binding show approximately 2-fold higher gab1-associated pi- <dig> kinase activity in response to egf treatment. consistent with these findings, previous studies have demonstrated that cells transiently over-expressing gab1f627/ <dig> bound more p <dig>  <cit> . in both gab <dig> and gab1f627/659expressing cells the gab1-associated pi- <dig> kinase activity is augmented by egf treatment. as expected, the additional mutation of the p <dig> binding sites eliminates gab1-associated pi- <dig> kinase activity. in order to assay the effects of egf stimulation on signaling downstream of pi- <dig> kinase, cells were treated with egf for varying periods of time and cell lysates were assayed for akt activation by immunoblotting with p-ser <dig> akt antibodies. interestingly, cells expressing the gab1f627/ <dig> protein reproducibly showed activation of akt with significantly sustained kinetics relative to cells expressing wild type gab <dig> . as expected, the additional mutation of the p <dig> binding sites  limited akt activation to levels similar to those observed in the gab <dig> -/- cells, confirming the requirement for pi- <dig> kinase association with gab <dig> to induce egf-mediated activation of the akt pathway. taken together, these results suggest a role for shp <dig> in negatively regulating the egf induced activation of the pi- <dig> kinase pathway via gab <dig>  possibly by dephosphorylating gab <dig> at p <dig> binding sites.

expression of erbb <dig> in gab <dig> -/- mefs enhances activation of the pi- <dig> kinase signaling pathway
as described above, pi- <dig> kinase is recruited to the egfr via the adaptor protein gab <dig>  the results presented here demonstrate that gab <dig> is required for egf-induced activation of the pi- <dig> kinase pathway via the egfr, presumably because this receptor does not contain binding sites for the p <dig> regulatory subunit of pi- <dig> kinase. the catalytically inactive erbb <dig> receptor, however, contains at least six binding sites for p <dig>  <cit> , and thus may bypass the requirement for gab <dig> in response to egf by heterodimerizing with the catalytically active egfr. in order to test this hypothesis, retroviral vectors were used to introduce either the gab <dig> or erbb <dig> genes into gab <dig> -/- mefs that endogenously express the egfr but not erbb <dig>  and pools of stable cell lines were selected for further analysis. we first assayed the ability of the endogenous egfr to be tyrosine autophosphorylated in response to egf, as well as the ability of the exogenous erbb <dig> receptor to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to stimulation with either egf or neuregulin . the experiment presented in fig 4a shows that all cell lines exhibit egfr autophosphorylation in response to egf treatment , while only cells expressing the ectopically introduced erbb <dig> protein show erbb <dig> tyrosine phosphorylation in response to egf stimulation. interestingly, erbb <dig> reproducibly shows constitutive low-level tyrosine phosphorylation that is augmented only  <dig> -fold in response to egf treatment. cells expressing erbb <dig> show tyrosine phosphorylation in response to treatment with nrg . expression of egfr and erbb <dig> in the appropriate cell lines was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for egfr and erbb <dig>  respectively . the apparent decrease in egfr expression in cells co-expressing egfr and erbb <dig> following egf treatment was not observed in repetitions of this experiment, and is likely due to a stripping anomaly. additionally, we demonstrated that gab <dig> -/- mefs that express wild type gab <dig> display gab <dig> tyrosine phosphorylation in response to egf treatment, while gab <dig> -/- control cells or those expressing erbb <dig> do not show gab <dig> phosphorylation .

in order to test the ability of erbb <dig> to rescue the egf-induced activation of the pi- <dig> kinase/akt signaling pathway in gab <dig> -/- mefs, we first assayed these cells for egf-induced pi- <dig> kinase activity. cells were either left unstimulated or were stimulated with egf and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. phosphotyrosine-associated pi- <dig> kinase activity was then assayed by analysis of pip <dig> production. as shown in figure 4c, both cells expressing wild type gab <dig> and erbb <dig> show pi- <dig> kinase activity, while gab <dig> -/- cells do not. interestingly, egf induces pi- <dig> kinase activity to a greater degree in cells expressing gab <dig> relative to cells expressing erbb <dig>  in order to assay the effects of egf stimulation on signaling downstream of pi- <dig> kinase, cells were treated with egf over varying periods of time and assayed for the presence of ser473-phosphorylated akt. treatment of cells expressing either wild type gab <dig> or erbb <dig> with egf induced rapid activation of akt, although cells expressing wild type gab <dig> reproducibly displaed higher levels of phosphorylated akt with significantly sustained kinetics relative to gab <dig> -/- cells expressing erbb <dig> . equal loading and expression levels of akt were confirmed by immunoblotting . cells expressing erbb <dig> displayed activation of akt in response to treatment with nrg at levels similar to or greater than that seen in gab1-expressing cells following egf treatment, with activation reproducibly observed at longer time points . again, equal loading and expression levels of akt were confirmed by immunoblotting . the phosphorylation of akt in cells expressing gab <dig>  which shows modest enhancement following treatment with nrg, may be attributed to alternate signaling pathways including those mediated by erbb <dig> and erbb <dig>  involvement of these receptors was not explored in this study. taken together, these results demonstrate that erbb <dig> can partially compensate for gab <dig> deficiency in egf-induced activation of the pi- <dig> kinase/akt signaling pathway, although gab1-mediated activation appears to be more robust, and likely represents the primary mechanism by which egf stimulates pi- <dig> kinase and akt. while erbb <dig> is relatively ineffective at mediating egf-stimulation of pi- <dig> kinase activation, it is an efficient mediator of pi- <dig> kinase stimulation in response to nrg stimulation. thus, egf and nrg can stimulate pi- <dig> kinase activation in normal and transfected cells by means of gab <dig> and erbb <dig>  respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here demonstrate an absolute requirement for gab <dig> in egf-induced activation of the pi- <dig> kinase/akt signaling pathway. using this approach we demonstrated a strict requirement for association between gab <dig> and p <dig> in egf-induced pi- <dig> kinase activation, suggesting that gab <dig> indeed provides an essential link between the egfr and pi- <dig> kinase. additionally, p <dig> binding does not play a significant role in shp <dig> recruitment to the egfr-gab <dig> signaling complex, in contrast to previous studies  <cit> . we further demonstrated that the gab1-shp <dig> complex is responsible for the negative regulation of the strength and duration of pi- <dig> kinase/akt signaling in response to egf previously observed in shp <dig> -/- cells. erbb <dig> expression can bypass the requirement for gab <dig> in egfr signaling and can partially rescue egf-induced activation of the pi- <dig> kinase/akt cell survival pathway. this alternate pathway to pi- <dig> kinase activation may provide cells with a means of controlling either the strength or duration of pi- <dig> kinase signaling through differential expression of gab <dig> and erbb <dig>  since the erbb3-mediated response appears to be weaker. thus gab <dig> plays an essential role in bringing together a multi-protein signaling complex in response to egf that modulates a critical aspect of cellular survival.
