BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is one of the leading causes of hospital-associated infections worldwide, with clinical manifestations including skin and soft-tissue infections, sepsis, pneumonia and toxic shock syndrome. a large proportion of these infections can be attributed to globally disseminated, methicillin-resistant clones associated with healthcare settings , often arising in individuals with predisposing risk factors  <cit> . in the past two decades, community-associated methicillin-resistant s. aureus  clones distinct from ha-mrsa clones have emerged to cause infections in otherwise healthy individuals and are often characterised by enhanced virulence and transmissibility  <cit> . some of these clones have become a major cause of nosocomial infections, obscuring the distinction between ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa  <cit> . although most research has so far originated from industrialised countries such as the united kingdom and united states  <cit> , there is an increasing awareness of the emergence of ca-mrsa clones in non- and newly-industrialised nations in africa, asia and the indian subcontinent  <cit> . some of these clones have now become globally disseminated  <cit> .

sequence type  <dig>  was originally isolated from india and bangladesh, where it has become increasingly common  <cit>  and appears capable of invading healthcare environments and displacing previously successful nosocomial mrsa  <cit> . it has subsequently been identified in england, france, germany, ireland, italy, norway, abu dhabi, saudi-arabia, malaysia, australia and new zealand  <cit> , often in patients with family background or travel histories to india or bangladesh  <cit> . in the past few years, several draft genomes have been assembled, revealing the genomic composition of st772-mrsa-v  <cit> . this lineage is closely related to clonal complex cc <dig> and harbours the relatively small and mobile staphylococcal cassette chromosome sccmec type v  <cit> . the draft genomes accommodate a novel prophage Φ-ind772pvl, carrying the enterotoxin gene sea and an operon encoding panton-valentine leukocidin , luks/f-pv  <cit> . this potent combination of toxins on the same prophage has so far not been reported in other strains of s. aureus  <cit> . a heavily truncated hlb-converting phage is also present, which carries only scn  as part of the immune evasion cluster  <cit> . in addition, a variety of enterotoxins and superantigens have been detected in st772-mrsa-v, including the variable presence of sec and sel, as well as the enterotoxin gene cluster egc  <cit> . finally, several genes encoding antibiotic resistance determinants  and non-synonymous mutations in resistance-associated genes have been discovered, which correspond to previously identified multidrug resistant phenotypes of st772-mrsa-v  <cit> .

despite these advances, the genomic location and context of resistance and virulence factors, which are frequently associated with mobile genetic elements   <cit> , has not yet been unambiguously determined in st772-mrsa-v  <cit> . published draft genomes of st772-mrsa-v have employed short-read sequencing technologies , resulting in relatively fragmented assemblies  and annotations and may lack important positional information of elements associated with resistance or virulence . recently, third-generation sequencing technologies have allowed for the closure of complex genomic regions and the recovery of contiguous genome sequences  <cit> , including for s. aureus  <cit> .table  <dig>

in this study, we present the complete genome sequence of dar <dig>  a multidrug resistant strain of st772-mrsa-v from mumbai, india  <cit> . pacific bioscience  single-molecule real-time  sequencing resulted in a single contig containing the complete chromosome of dar <dig>  which was error checked and corrected with illumina reads. annotation and comparison to nine other isolates from australia, malaysia and india highlighted an association of resistance and virulence determinants with mges. additional resistance-associated mutations and gene redundancy explain the multidrug-resistant phenotype of dar <dig>  the closed genome sequence fully defines the genomic composition of dar <dig> and provides a valuable reference genome for future investigations into the genomic epidemiology and phylogeography of st772-mrsa-v.

RESULTS
smrt sequencing and subsequent assembly generated a single continuous sequence containing the complete chromosome of dar <dig> . a second shorter sequence was identical to the plasmid pkh- <dig>  carrying cadmium resistance gene cadd and its regulator cadx . the length of the completed chromosome was  <dig> , <dig> base pairs  with a g + c content of  <dig> %.  <dig>  protein coding regions, as well as  <dig> rrnas,  <dig> trnas,  <dig> ncrnas  and  <dig> transposases associated with insertion sequence elements and transposons  were identified and annotated. notably, gaps in the draft genome assemblies of other strains of st772-mrsa-v  frequently occurred in the vicinity of transposases, suggesting that some of the short read assemblies were unable to bridge gaps associated with repetitive genomic elements. this clearly emphasizes the potential for obtaining fully defined de novo assemblies using third-generation sequencing technologies, which are able to resolve both local and global repeats  <cit>  and avoid the introduction of reference bias. in silico multi-locus sequencing typing confirmed st <dig>  with a single allele divergence from st <dig> . although a single locus variant of st <dig> , the agr locus of dar <dig> is part of agr group ii rather than group iii. a close relationship of the core genome is evident for all available genomes of st772-mrsa-v. excluding mges, the pairwise core genome snp differences between dar <dig> and other st772-mrsa-v genomes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> snps . dar <dig> harbours the staphylococcal cassette chromosome sccmec type v containing the cassette recombinase ccrc2; the composition and arrangement are nearly identical to the previously identified sccmec in strain  <dig>  <cit> , with the exception of an additional mobile element inserted immediately upstream of the terminal direct repeat dr <dig>  the element carried the bifunctional aminoglycoside modifying gene aaca-aphd and was flanked by transposases of is <dig>  its composition identified the element as transposon tn <dig>  <cit>   and it was present at the same location in all available genomes of st772-mrsa-v, except strain  <dig> .figure  <dig> comparison of draft genomes of nine strains of st772-mrsa-v to the complete reference genome of strain dar <dig>  the outer ring describes the location of selected genes associated with antibiotic resistance , resistance mutations  and selected staphylococcal toxins and superantigens  in dar <dig>  the second ring denotes mobile genetic elements, including pathogenicity islands, phages and the integrated resistance plasmid, as well as the staphylocccal cassete chromosome sscmec-v-c <dig> . the third ring designates the location of transposases  as determined by the final annotation of dar <dig>  the subsequent rings and colours in the legend represent the strains used for comparison with dar <dig> the innermost rings shows the gc content  and gc skew . note that redundant genes in the reference genome  appear as multiple copies in the comparison genomes, even if they only exist as a single copy .



resistance to multiple antibiotics mediated by mobile genetic elements
we found several additional resistance-associated genes, most of which were located on mges and correlated with the resistance phenotype of dar <dig> . one core genome copy of the dihydrofolate reductase gene dfra and two copies of dfrg were identified, which have been linked to high-level trimethoprim resistance in s. aureus  <cit> . the first copy of dfrg was found in the context of several phage genes and within the boundary of the terminal attachment site  of a putatitve sapi, partially identical with the pathogenicity island sapitokyo <dig>  . the island also contained the enterotoxin genes sec and sel, placed in a similar context and position as vsa <dig> type ii, a pathogenicity island of strain mw <dig>  <cit> . monecke et al.  <cit>  noted the frequent but variable presence of sec and sel in st772-mrsa-v, which was supported in this study by the absence of the putative sapi in strain  <dig> . the second copy of dfrg was found in the chromosome at  <dig> , <dig> bp. both sequences, with two adjacent coding regions for hypothetical proteins, were identical to genomic regions in st <dig> strain tw <dig> from the uk  <cit> , the trimethoprim-resistant s. pyogenes strain a <dig> from india  <cit>  and part of the transposon tn <dig> from listeria monocytogenes  <cit>  . analysis with resfinder  <cit>  confirmed the presence of the two dfrg copies in dar <dig>  but only identified the sapi-associated copy in the draft genomes of 07– <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and kt/y <dig> and the core-associated copy in isolates  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  lvp <dig>  vh <dig>  the presence of dfrg was also confirmed by mapping paired-end short reads against our resistome database and corresponded to a high-level trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  resistance phenotype of dar <dig>  . the dfrg gene was previously thought to be rare in s. aureus colonising humans, but has recently been found to be widespread in sub-saharan africa  <cit> .table  <dig>

similarly, two copies of the beta-lactam resistance operon  were identified in dar <dig>  the first copy was part of a partial integrated plasmid highly similar in composition to the plasmid p18810- <dig>   found in ca-mrsa strain  <dig> of usa <dig>  <cit>  and nearly identical with the integrated plasmid in strain 11819– <dig> of ca-mrsa st80-iv    <cit> . the integrated plasmid encoded a resistance cluster composed of apha-iii, sat <dig> and a partial aade , as well as mphc and msra , thus resolving the genomic context of these genes previously noted by monecke et al.  <cit> . draft genomes of strains 07– <dig> and  <dig> respectively lacked or carried a truncated, plasmid-associated blaz, whereas the integrated plasmid was entirely absent in strains  <dig> and  <dig> . the second copy of the beta-lactam resistance operon was located immediately downstream of three transposases related to tn <dig> and was present in all isolates of st772-mrsa-v. the tn554-like transposon  <cit>  was previously found with nearly identical sequence composition in h-emrsa- <dig>  and ho  <dig>  <dig>  of st <dig>  <cit> .

resistance to multiple antibiotics mediated by core chromosome genes and mutations
three additional, chromosomal resistance genes identified in dar <dig> were the transporter genes nora and norb, whose altered expression is associated with quinolone resistance  <cit>  and the efflux pump tet, which can confer resistance to tetracyclines when upregulated  <cit> . the presence of tet alone did not result in phenotypic resistance for dar <dig> . notably, tet also facilitates the efflux of antibacterial fatty acids, which promotes survival in an abscess environment and colonisation of skin surfaces  <cit> .

furthermore, the chromosomal genes grla/grlb and gyra/gyrb harbour common non-synonymous mutations associated with increased resistance against quinolones in s. aureus  <cit> . we found two mutations in st772-mrsa-v, one in grla  and another in gyra . these correspond to ciprofloxacin-resistance associated mutations previously found in st772-mrsa-v and other sts from india  <cit> . we also detected non-synonymous mutations in the genes dfra , iles- <dig>  and mprf  that were present in all examined strains of st772-mrsa-v. these were located in the vicinity of mutations that have previously been linked with resistance to trimethoprim  <cit> , mupirocin  <cit>  and daptomycin  <cit>  in s. aureus, respectively.

phage and virulence determinants
in addition to the antibiotic resistance factors and the putative sapi, dar <dig> harbours the genomic islands vsaα, vsaβ and vsaγ. these were present in all investigated genomes of st772-mrsa-v  and encoded several superantigen-like proteins and toxin determinants, including the enterotoxin gene cluster  on vsaβ as well as α-haemolysin  and exfoliative toxin a  on vsaγ. in addition, vsaα harbors aadk, encoding aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, which is associated with low-level streptomycin resistance in bacillus subtilis  <cit> . the recently described prophage Φ-ind772pvl, containing the staphylococcal enterotoxin a  and the pvl-operon , was also found in all isolates, confirming its widespread presence in st772-mrsa-v from india  <cit> . dar <dig> harboured the heavily truncated hlb-converting prophage encoding the staphylococcal complement inhibitor   <cit> , immediately followed by the hlg-related leukocidin genes lukf and luks  <cit> . we also found a second putative enterotoxin gene with high similarity to sea within the chromosome at  <dig> , <dig> bp  . additionally, dar <dig> contained one previously undetected prophage region at  <dig>  bp. this prophage did not harbour known resistance or virulence genes and the central region was present only in dar <dig>   <dig> and lvp <dig> . the entire region was similar to φmu50b of strain mu <dig>  , with the core region showing highest similarity to φnm <dig> and φnm <dig>  .

finally, a putative and a truncated transposase for is <dig> were found in the vicinity  of the global transcriptional regulator of virulence rot . benson et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that insertion of is <dig> elements into the promoter region of rot was responsible for derepression of cytotoxin expression and increased virulence of usa <dig> strains. although we did not examine the functional significance of this arrangement, the role of gene expression regulation is becoming increasingly recognized to contribute to variations in virulence and antibiotic resistance of s. aureus  <cit>  and thus may be of interest to future investigations into st772-mrsa-v. similarly, the functional role of the agr group ii locus in dar <dig> is of interest as it differs from the agr group iii locus found in other clonal complex  <dig> strains  <cit> .

comparison to other sts
there are notable differences between dar <dig> and other sequenced ca-mrsa strains with regards to acquired antimicrobial resistance and virulence determinants . the level of multi-drug resistance is greater than that seen in the key ca-mrsa clones from the us – usa <dig>  <cit>  and mw <dig>  <cit> , europe – st <dig>  <cit> , australia – st <dig>  <cit> , and asia – st <dig>  <cit> . in particular, dar <dig> has mges encoding for resistance to cotrimoxazole and aminoglycosides that are not present in the other ca-mrsa genomes. the integrated plasmid harbouring resistance genes blaz, mphc, apha-iii and msra is found only in dar <dig> and st <dig> strain 11819–97; although in contrast to 11819– <dig> the integrated plasmid is not within the sccmec element in dar <dig>  <cit> .

although all the above listed ca-mrsa strains harbor pvl-encoding phage, the combination of sea and pvl on Φ-ind772pvl only occurs in st772-mrsa-v  <cit> . in comparison to the other strains that carry 2– <dig> enterotoxin genes, dar <dig> harbors  <dig> such genes, including sec and sel on the putative sapi and the enterotoxin cluster seg, sei, sem, sen and seo on vsaβ. dar <dig> contains capsid type  <dig>  but lacks both the serine-like protease operon spl and lukd/e. in total, compared to other important genome sequenced ca-mrsa strains, dar <dig> contains a striking combination of acquired antimicrobial and virulence determinants. it should be noted that the small number of available genomes examined in this study may cause a bias towards isolates that are particularly virulent or multi-drug resistant and therefore may not be an accurate assessment of these traits in the lineage at large. however, previous studies on larger collections that included molecular typing of resistance and virulence factors have determined similar resistance profiles and confirmed the widespread presence of virulence determinants, such as the egc gene cluster or pvl  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the complete genome of st772-mrsa-v is remarkable for the presence of multiple mges mediating a highly antibiotic resistant phenotype. this phenotype is further augmented by the presence of core genome resistance-associated mutations and redundancy of some resistance mediating genes. for example, dar <dig> demonstrates high-level resistance to tmp-sxt  and contains three relevant resistance genes, dfra and two copies of dfrg. additionally, dar <dig> carries a large complement of virulence factors including multiple enterotoxins, α-haemolysin and pvl.

recommended oral antibiotics for the treatment of community-associated s. aureus skin and soft tissue infections include anti-staphylococcal β-lactams, clindamycin, tmp-sxt, erythromycin, and doxycycline  <cit> . dar <dig> is resistant to all of these antibiotics except for doxycycline , which if up-regulated could conceivably result in phenotypic resistance). unfortunately, a multidrug-resistant genotype is not restricted to dar <dig> and appears to be a consistent feature of all st772-mrsa-v strains analysed in this study. thus, simple oral treatment options for the st <dig> lineage are truly limited.

the increasing prevalence of st772-mrsa-v in india and its appearance in multiple regions of the world  <cit> , should raise concerns. as with highly resistant gram-negatives, drivers of the emergence and spread of st772-mrsa-v need urgent study. here, we have defined the bacterial factors that contribute to the multidrug-resistant phenotype of this lineage. studies to understand the global phylogeography of st <dig> can now make use of the closed reference genome of dar <dig>
