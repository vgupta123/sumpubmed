BACKGROUND
plasmopara viticola  berl. and de toni is a biotrophic oomycete that causes downy mildew in grapevine
 <cit> . this devastating disease occurs worldwide, particularly in regions with warm and wet conditions during the growing season. p. viticola mainly infects leaves and clusters of young berries and produces oil spot lesions on the adaxial leaf surface accompanied by massive sporulation on the abaxial surface. although downy mildew can be controlled by frequent applications of chemical fungicides, concerns about the environmental impact of pesticide overuse
 <cit>  and the development of resistant p. viticola populations
 <cit>  have sparked an interest in alternatives to chemical treatments.

the grapevine industry relies predominantly on vitis vinifera, which is susceptible to downy mildew. resistance traits have been identified in wild grapevine species, and the mechanisms of resistance to downy mildew have been characterized in resistant genotypes
 <cit> . transcriptomic analysis supports the view that downy mildew resistance is mainly a post-infection phenomenon
 <cit>  and highlights the importance of transcriptional reprogramming in both resistant and susceptible genotypes in response to p. viticola inoculation
 <cit> . transcriptional changes associated with p. viticola infection of susceptible grapevines have been related to a weak defence response
 <cit>  and to the establishment of a compatible interaction
 <cit> . the response of resistant genotypes has been characterized by strong and rapid transcriptional reprogramming of processes related to defence, signal transduction, and secondary metabolism, which are either not induced or induced to a lesser extent in susceptible grapevines
 <cit> . in particular, downy mildew resistance has been correlated with enhanced expression of genes encoding pathogenesis-related  proteins and enzymes of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and with specific modulation of signal transduction components and markers of hypersensitive response  in resistant grapevines
 <cit> .

downy mildew symptoms can be significantly reduced in susceptible grapevines by preventive application of resistance inducers, such as chitosan
 <cit> , laminarins
 <cit> , β-aminobutyric acid 
 <cit> , acibenzolar-s-methyl 
 <cit> , and thiamine
 <cit> . treatments with plant extracts
 <cit>  or microbial extracts
 <cit>  have also been found to increase grapevine resistance to downy mildew. the ascomycete trichoderma harzianum strain t <dig>  significantly reduces downy mildew symptoms by activating grapevine resistance both locally and systemically
 <cit> , although the molecular events responsible for resistance induction have not yet been clarified. trichoderma spp. strains have been characterized in model systems based on their ability to induce plant resistance against pathogens
 <cit>  by reprogramming the plant transcriptome
 <cit> . specific strains of beneficial microorganisms can improve plant performance by activating a plant-mediated defence mechanism known as induced systemic resistance 
 <cit> . through root or leaf interactions
 <cit> , beneficial microorganisms are recognized by the plant, which results in a mild but effective activation of the plant immune responses in all tissues
 <cit> . isr confers broad-spectrum resistance to various types of pathogens and abiotic stresses
 <cit>  and is usually regulated by jasmonic acid - and ethylene -dependent signalling pathways
 <cit> . rather than directly activating plant defences, beneficial microorganisms that induce resistance usually prime the plant so that it responds more strongly upon exposure to the stress condition
 <cit> . primed plants display faster and/or stronger activation of the defence responses after pathogen inoculation
 <cit> . because plant defences are activated only when they are really needed
 <cit> , priming provides advantages in terms of energy costs for the plant
 <cit> , and it is probably evolved to save energy under pathogen-free conditions
 <cit> . the benefits of priming outweigh its costs when disease does occur, and priming is seen as a promising strategy in modern disease management
 <cit> . the absence of apparent energy costs associated with t39-induced resistance in grapevine suggested a priming state activation
 <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance induction have been only partially revealed
 <cit> , and information regarding induced resistance in grapevine is particularly scarce
 <cit> .

in this study, we used illumina rna-seq analysis to characterize the global transcriptional dynamics associated with t39-induced resistance in grapevine. to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate molecular events underlying induced resistance in plants, and it is also the first transcriptome-wide characterization of resistance induced by a beneficial microbe in a non-model plant. our analysis revealed that the reduction of downy mildew symptoms is related to a complex transcriptional reprogramming in t39-treated plants, both before and 24 h after pathogen inoculation. in particular, the reaction of t39-treated plants to pathogen inoculation is associated with enhanced expression of p. viticola-responsive genes and specific modulation of some genes related to defence in resistant grapevines. our study has identified genes that could be valuable as markers of isr activation for subsequent selection of new resistance inducers with improved ability to stimulate plant defences.

RESULTS
rna-seq sequencing and mapping of reads to the grapevine genome
the ability of t <dig> to activate local and systemic resistance processes has been previously reported in grapevine
 <cit> , and leaf treatment was used to study responses to t <dig> treatment and pathogen inoculation in the same plant organ. leaf samples were collected before and 24 h after p. viticola inoculation from t39-treated and control plants, and resistance induction was confirmed by phenotypic analysis . four different treatments were analysed by rna-seq: control , t39-treated , p. viticola-inoculated control  and p. viticola-inoculated t39-treated  plants. three biological replicates of each treatment were analysed, with each biological replicate sequenced twice in separate lanes . between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million paired-end reads of  <dig> nucleotides were obtained for each sequencing replicate, and an average of 94% of these passed the quality control test . summing the reads of two sequencing replicates, more than  <dig>  million filtered reads were obtained for each biological replicate , corresponding to a coverage of at least 32× the grapevine transcriptome .

gene expression estimation by rna-seq
gene expression level was assessed on the basis of both unique and multi-reads  to improve evaluation of members of multigene families
 <cit> , and it was expressed as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped  values using cufflinks
 <cit> . between one and nine transcript isoforms were recognized for each grapevine gene, and  <dig>  to  <dig>  novel genes were identified in each sequencing replicate , representing important new information for genome annotation. about 66% of grapevine genes were expressed in each sequencing replicate . high correlations between sequencing replicates were obtained , and read counts were summed to obtain better coverage and improve variance estimation of each biological replicate
 <cit> . considering the expression of all grapevine genes, the pearson’s correlation coefficient between control and t39-treated plants  was greater than that between control and p. viticola-inoculated plants , suggesting that few transcriptional changes were caused by t <dig> treatment and that major transcriptional reprogramming occurred after pathogen inoculation.

pearson’s correlation coefficients are based on the expression values of all grapevine genes, expressed as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped , in control , trichoderma harzianum t39-treated , plasmopara viticola-inoculated control , and p. viticola-inoculated t39-treated  plants.

grapevine genes differentially expressed during trichoderma harzianum t39-induced resistance
deseq statistical analysis
 <cit>  revealed that  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed with respect to the control with a false discovery rate  of 5% and a minimum fold-change of two in at least one pairwise comparison . about 90% of these genes were expressed in all treatments , indicating that t <dig> and p. viticola caused a significant modulation  of genes normally expressed in control leaves. relatively few genes were specifically expressed in response to the t <dig> treatment  and after p. viticola inoculation in control  and t39-treated plants .
 <cit>  with a false discovery rate  of 5% and a fold-change greater than two in at least one pairwise comparison.  grouping of differentially expressed genes into  <dig> clusters based on the expression profiles. genes modulated by t <dig> were distinguished as those with comparable expression levels before and after p. viticola inoculation in t39-treated plants , genes initially modulated by t <dig> and further modulated by p. viticola inoculation in t39-treated plants , and genes affected exclusively by t <dig> . genes modulated by p. viticola with comparable expression levels in control and t39-treated plants were classified as those with  and without  direct modulation by t <dig>  genes modulated by p. viticola with greater modulation  in t39-treated than in control plants  where classified as those with  and without  modulation by t <dig> treatment. genes modulated by p. viticola exclusively in control plants were classified as those with  and without  modulation by t <dig>  whereas genes modulated by p. viticola exclusively in t39-treated plants were grouped in cluster  <dig> .

the expression profiles of the differentially expressed genes were determined by cluster analysis, and genes were grouped into  <dig> clusters based on their expression modulation . among genes modulated by t <dig>   <dig> had comparable expression levels before and after p. viticola inoculation in t39-treated plants , while  <dig> genes were initially modulated by t <dig> and then further modulated by p. viticola inoculation in t39-treated plants . in addition, the expression of  <dig> genes was affected exclusively by t <dig> treatment and not by p. viticola . p. viticola inoculation resulted in modulation of  <dig>  genes with comparable expression levels in control and t39-treated plants at 24 h after inoculation; of these,  <dig> genes were directly modulated by t <dig> treatment  and  <dig>  genes were not . interestingly,  <dig> genes showed reinforced modulation in t39-treated plants compared to control plants after p. viticola inoculation , indicating enhancement of the grapevine defence reaction to the pathogen. among these genes,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were modulated  or not  by t <dig> treatment, respectively. a total of  <dig> genes were modulated by p. viticola exclusively in control plants; of these,  <dig> genes were directly modulated by t <dig> treatment  and  <dig> genes were not . conversely,  <dig> genes were modulated by p. viticola exclusively in t39-treated plants , and they represent the specific reaction to p. viticola of t39-treated plants. isr-responsive specific genes were mainly induced , while genes modulated by p. viticola exclusively in control plants were mainly repressed .

functional annotation of differentially expressed genes
differentially expressed genes were automatically annotated and then grouped into  <dig> functional categories of gene ontology  biological processes ; genes that could not be associated with any biological process category were assigned to the go root . although the group of genes with unknown function was the largest ,  <dig> categories were represented to different degrees in differentially expressed genes compared to the grapevine transcriptome. dna  and protein  metabolic processes were significantly underrepresented among the differentially expressed genes, but response to stress , response to stimulus , and signal transduction  categories were significantly overrepresented. likewise, transport  and metabolism of carbohydrates , lipids , secondary compounds , and energy  were significantly overrepresented. the large fraction of differentially expressed genes with unknown function highlighted the identification of novel processes potentially relevant for the induction of plant resistance and for the response of grapevine to p. viticola inoculation. however, additional studies are required to better characterize the relevance of these genes in the mechanisms of t39-indiuced resistance.
 <cit> . asterisks indicate go functional categories differentially represented in the differentially expressed genes compared to the entire grapevine transcriptome according to gostat statistical analysis 
 <cit> .

after genes with unknown function were discounted, a specific distribution of up- and down-regulated functional categories was observed in the various clusters . genes of cluster  <dig> involved in carbohydrate, protein, and secondary metabolism were mainly induced by t <dig> , whereas those related to lipid metabolism and transport were mainly repressed . genes of cluster  <dig> related to protein metabolism and transcription were mainly repressed by t <dig> and subsequently induced by p. viticola inoculation of t39-treated plants. more specifically, t <dig> treatment directly induced the expression of genes encoding protein kinases and receptor-like protein kinases, myb transcription factors, hormone-responsive genes, defence-related proteins, and enzymes of secondary metabolism. annotation of genes modulated exclusively by t <dig>  revealed down-regulation of processes related to response to stimulus, cellular component organization, and protein metabolism .
 <cit> .

genes that were similarly modulated by p. viticola in control and t39-treated plants  were mainly related to primary metabolic processes and signal transduction . in particular, genes involved in cellular component organization and carbohydrate metabolism were mainly induced . more specifically, p. viticola induced six cellulose synthase-like genes, six expansin genes, as well as genes encoding enzymes of glucan biosynthesis and hexose metabolism. conversely, lipid metabolic process, signal transduction, response to stress, and response to stimulus were mainly repressed by p. viticola ; this included genes encoding protein kinases, receptor-like protein kinases, disease resistance proteins, and prs.

the categories of response to stress, secondary metabolism, and dna metabolism were significantly overrepresented in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  and the genes in these categories were mainly up-regulated following p. viticola inoculation . in particular, expression of protein kinase, disease resistance protein, chitinase , stilbene synthase , resveratrol o-methyltransferase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , and transcription factor genes was enhanced after p. viticola inoculation in t39-treated plants compared with control plants.

clusters of genes modulated by p. viticola exclusively in control plants revealed global down-regulation of genes related to protein metabolic process , response to stress , and response to stimulus . interestingly, the same categories repressed by p. viticola in control plants were globally induced in t39-treated plants . in particular, genes related to protein metabolic process, response to stress, response to stimulus, and transcription were mainly up-regulated by p. viticola in t39-treated plants . this active reaction to the pathogen in t39-treated plants included expression of protein kinases, transcription factors, auxin and ja/et signals, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and defence-related genes.

validation of rna-seq analysis
to validate the rna-seq results, we used real-time rt-pcr to analyse the expression levels of  <dig> differentially expressed genes . we selected genes with different expression profiles and expression levels, including genes associated with different functional categories . although the extent of modulation revealed by real-time rt-pcr and rna-seq may differ
 <cit> , the real-time rt-pcr expression profiles in our analysis were in complete agreement with the rna-seq data for  <dig> genes. the expression profiles generated by real-time rt-pcr and rna-seq differed for three genes in one treatment and for two genes in all treatments. these differences could be due to differences in sensitivity, particularly in distinguishing members of multigene families. specificity for rna-seq analysis was observed in two grapevine chitinases  that are known to be strongly  or weakly  up-regulated after p. viticola inoculation

we also validated the rna-seq method by confirming the expression of previously identified markers of plant response to trichoderma spp. and p. viticola . our rna-seq data confirmed p. viticola-dependent up-regulation of pr <dig>  pr <dig>  pr <dig>  and pr <dig> genes in susceptible grapevines

 <cit> . the rna-seq analysis revealed t39-dependent induction of genes that are known to be involved in trichoderma-induced resistance in other systems
 <cit> . moreover, rna-seq analysis confirmed the modulation of genes known to be affected by p. viticola in grapevines
 <cit> .

discussion
rna-seq analyses of leaf samples collected before and 24 h after p. viticola inoculation from t39-treated and control plants resulted in the identification of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes. these genes formed  <dig> clusters of different expression profiles, highlighting the complex transcriptional reprogramming of t39-induced resistance. t <dig> treatment directly affected the expression of grapevine genes and to a greater extent enhanced grapevine response to p. viticola inoculation, indicating a dual effect of t <dig>  at the sampling time points selected in this analysis, we showed that a limited number of changes in gene expression were caused by t <dig> treatment and that more intense transcriptional reprogramming took place after pathogen inoculation. in particular, opposing modulation of genes related to response to stress and protein metabolism was observed in t39-treated and control plants at 24 h after p. viticola inoculation, indicating inhibition of disease-related processes and induction of active defence in t39-treated grapevines. based on the expression profiles, genes directly modulated by t <dig>  as well as genes with reinforced or specific modulation in t39-treated plants after pathogen inoculation are strong candidates for activation of plant self-protection and consequent inhibition of disease-related processes and symptoms development.

grapevine processes directly affected by trichoderma harzianum t39
analysis of the expression profiles revealed a set of genes directly modulated by t <dig>  and whose expression was not affected by the subsequent pathogen inoculation . several genes of cluster  <dig> were involved in signal transduction processes, indicating that they may be related to the initial events of recognition of the beneficial microorganism and induction of resistance, as recently demonstrated by the proteomic analysis of t39-induced resistance
 <cit> . enzymes known to mediate microbial recognition and to trigger defence responses in plant species
 <cit>  were up-regulated by t <dig>  and these included  <dig> receptor-like protein kinase genes, three protein kinase genes, and one protein phosphatase gene. in particular, the serine/threonine kinase receptor  was similar to the arabidopsis frk <dig> induced by bacterial flagellins
 <cit> , and a protein kinase was homologous to the trichoderma-induced kinase  of cucumber
 <cit> . furthermore, the stkr gene  is induced by p. viticola in resistant grapevines
 <cit> , suggesting that it plays a crucial role in the activation of specific defence processes against downy mildew.

our data suggest that resistance induction was also mediated by hormone signalling and transcriptional reprogramming. genes related to et metabolism  were induced by t <dig> treatment, together with two myb , one fama, and one nac transcription factors. activation of et metabolism was in agreement with previous data showing that ja/et signals are involved in t39-induced resistance
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, myb <dig> plays a crucial role in trichoderma-induced resistance
 <cit>  and is required in early signalling of rhizobacteria-induced resistance in arabidopsis <cit> . the nac gene is involved during oxidative stress
 <cit> , and response to oxidative stress after t <dig> treatment was suggested by modulation of two peroxidases, three glutathione s-transferases , and one thioredoxin. moreover, defence-related genes  were also directly induced, indicating that the maximum expression level of these genes was probably reached after t <dig> treatment and that this was sufficient to contribute to defence against subsequent p. viticola inoculation. other defence-related genes were pre-induced by t <dig> and further induced after p. viticola inoculation , indicating reinforcement of grapevine defence after pathogen inoculation.

enhanced reaction of t39-treated plants to plasmopara viticola
plant resistance induced by beneficial microorganisms has been associated with faster and/or stronger activation of defence responses after pathogen inoculation
 <cit> . p. vitiocla-responsive genes with enhanced expression in t39-treated plants were clustered to distinguish between those directly modulated  and those not modulated  by t <dig> treatment. these expression profiles provide strong support for the view that trichoderma spp. may have a dual effect: it directly stimulates induction of some genes and further reinforces modulation of these and other genes after pathogen inoculation
 <cit> . the dual effect was also reported for defence-gene modulation during resistance induced by sulfated laminarin
 <cit>  and for phytoalexin accumulation during resistance induced by rheum palmatum extracts
 <cit> .

enhanced reaction of t39-treated plants included induction of genes related to response to stimulus and response to stress categories, suggesting improvement of signalling pathways and activation of defence reactions in response to pathogen inoculation. in particular,  <dig> receptor-like kinase genes  and six protein kinase genes  of signal transduction were primed in t39-treated plants. in agreement with our results, priming was associated with increased expression of mitogen-activated protein kinases  in arabidopsis plants
 <cit> . up-regulation of mpk genes was also associated with the reaction of resistant grapevines to p. viticola <cit> , and post-translational modification may be the additional mechanism for activating mpks in response to pathogens
 <cit> . moreover, expression of stress-related genes was enhanced in inoculated t39-treated plants, and these genes included pr <dig>  pr <dig>  pr <dig>  pr <dig>  chit <dig>  and osmotin . similar profiles were observed for arabidopsis pr genes during t. asperelloides t <dig> and pseudomonas syringae interactions
 <cit> , indicating common mechanisms of trichoderma-induced resistance against biotrophs. primed profiles were found in resistance-related genes . peronospora parasitica resistance genes  must be expressed at optimal levels to function against downy mildew in arabidopsis <cit> , and specific profiles of grapevine rpp genes suggest fine tuning during t39-induced resistance.

a key role of transcriptional regulation and secondary metabolic processes in t39-induced resistance was also indicated by the priming profiles of four myb, two wrky, and  <dig> et-responsive transcription factors , and of pal and stss genes. moreover, the category dna metabolic process was significantly overrepresented in isr-primed genes. in particular, expression of the histone-lysine n-methyltransferases suvr <dig> and atx <dig> was enhanced after p. viticola inoculation, reflecting possible involvement of epigenetic modifications
 <cit>  in t39-induced resistance.

genes with enhanced expression in t39-treated plants have been previously related to defence against downy mildew in resistant grapevines. this was the case for pr genes , invertase genes , and genes related to secondary metabolism , for which up-regulation was greater in resistant than in susceptible grapevines upon p. viticola inoculation
 <cit> . the expression profiles of these marker genes suggest that the defence processes usually activated against downy mildew in resistant grapevines are partially stimulated in susceptible plants by t39-induced resistance.

disease-related processes inhibited in t39-treated plants
another important aspect of t39-induced resistance was evidenced by genes modulated by p. viticola exclusively in control plants . these genes were mainly down-regulated , and they reflect exploitation of cellular resources and/or suppression of defence responses during the compatible interaction. down-regulation caused by p. viticola in control plants involved categories of response to stress and primary metabolic processes. many signalling components , transcription factors , and disease resistance proteins were repressed, supporting the view that suppression of endogenous signals is required to establish the compatible interaction
 <cit> . three abc transporters  were also repressed, and suppression of some abc transporters increases the susceptibility to oomycete pathogens
 <cit> . specific alteration of carbohydrate metabolism by p. viticola in control plants was highlighted by modulation of glucosidase, galactosidase, mannosidase, and sucrose synthase  genes. moreover, repressed genes of cluster  <dig> were classified into the categories of energy metabolism  and defence response , reflecting disease-related process employed by p. viticola only in control plants. p. viticola might need to actively suppress plant defences during leaf colonisation through microbial effectors, as demonstrated in other oomycetes
 <cit> . particularly, hemibiotrophic and biotrophic species establish intimate associations with plants
 <cit> . to establish infection, these pathogens must suppress the plant defence and manipulate the host metabolism by microbial effectors  that are translocated inside the plant cell or secreted into the extracellular space within plant tissue
 <cit> . p. viticola effector genes have been recently described
 <cit> , and modulation of host cell defences through virulence factors in susceptible grapevines has been indicated by histochemical
 <cit>  and transcriptomic
 <cit>  analyses. in agreement with the phenotypic observations, the specific modulation of grapevine genes in inoculated control but not in inoculated t39-treated plants indicates that t39-induced resistance acts by inhibiting some disease-related processes and probably by interfering with some pathogen-induced processes.

specific transcriptional response of t39-treated plants to plasmopara viticola
in contrast to broad down-regulation of genes in control plants , genes specifically modulated by p. viticola in t39-treated plants  were mainly induced . these opposing reactions to p. viticola are particularly evident in genes related to protein metabolism, response to stimulus, and response to stress, which were mainly induced in t39-treated plants and mainly repressed in control plants. up-regulation of genes associated with these categories has been observed in resistant grapevines
 <cit> , indicating that the defence processes of resistant genotypes could be partially activated in susceptible varieties by t39-induced resistance. in particular, all nbs-encoding resistance  genes modulated by p. viticola in control plants  were repressed, whereas those with isr-responsive specific profiles  or isr-primed profiles  were mainly up-regulated. opposing modulation of nbsr genes probably reflects suppression of plant defence in control plants and activation of defence responses in t39-treated plants. interestingly, the nbsr genes of clusters  <dig> and  <dig> belong mainly to the va component genome of grapevine
 <cit> , indicating subgenome-dependent regulation of gene expression
 <cit>  in grapevine.

defence signals specifically activated in t39-treated plants included those mediated by auxin , et , and ja . the role of ja/et signalling pathways in t39-induced resistance has also been demonstrated by phytohormone-affected arabidopsis mutants
 <cit>  and by expression analysis of grapevine marker genes
 <cit> . isr is commonly regulated by ja/et-dependent signalling pathways, and it is especially active against pathogens deterred by defences that are controlled by ja and et
 <cit> . the auxin response pathway is connected to the sa and ja/et signalling networks
 <cit> , and crosstalk between hormonal pathways
 <cit>  enables the fine tuning of defence mechanisms so that the plant can tailor its response to the specific invader
 <cit> . et exerts its resistance-stimulating activity in concert with ja
 <cit> , and ja pathways are involved in the reaction to p. viticola in resistant grapevines
 <cit> . thus, enhancement of ja/et signals in t39-treated plants supports the view that increased resistance to downy mildew is mediated by partial activation of extant defence mechanisms normally activated in resistant genotypes. reaction to the pathogen was also mediated by specific up-regulation of  <dig> receptor kinases,  <dig> protein kinases, two bhlhs genes, one myb gene, and the npr <dig>  gene.

our results also suggest that the cell redox balance is altered in t39-treated plants after pathogen inoculation. the reaction of t39-treated plants to pathogen inoculation included the induction four peroxidases and a gst. antioxidant enzymes are often induced in response to pathogens, and alteration of oxidative-stress metabolism has a prominent role in the t39-induced resistance of grapevine to downy mildew
 <cit> . peroxidases play several important roles in pathogen resistance by contributing to the production of reactive oxygen species, the reinforcement of cell walls, and the production of phytoalexins. accumulation of stilbene phytoalexin is one of the most important defence processes activated by resistant grapevines in response to p. viticola <cit> ; genes of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis  were specifically induced in t39-treated plants, confirming activation of pathways known in resistant genotypes. however, additional defence mechanisms against p. viticola are activated in resistant genotypes. in particular, hr-related genes  were not induced and localised hr necrosis was not observed in t39-treated plants.

common transcriptional response of control and t39-treated plants to plasmopara viticola
although specific transcriptional reprogramming of t39-treated plants was observed,  <dig>  genes had comparable expression levels in control and t39-treated plants after p. viticola inoculation . the pathogen-responsive processes not affected by resistance induction were mainly related to primary metabolism and signal transduction. in particular, expression profiles of genes related to starch metabolism  indicated the source-to-sink transition of p. viticola-infected leaves
 <cit> . likewise, genes related to photosynthesis  and to the calvin cycle  were similarly modulated in inoculated control and t39-treated plants, possibly reflecting the establishment of a compatible interaction. p. viticola inoculation also resulted in the down-regulation of genes involved in the signal transduction processes  and defence response , indicating a pathogen-dependent suppression of the host reaction mechanisms.

other markers of p. viticola infection in susceptible grapevines showed comparable modulation in t39-treated and control plants, such as enzymatic resistance protein
 <cit> , zeaxanthin epoxidase
 <cit> , catalase
 <cit> , isoforms of chalcone synthase
 <cit> , and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase
 <cit> . these results suggested that transcriptional changes associated with the compatible interaction
 <cit>  were not completely inhibited in t39-treated plants, which is consistent with the observation that downy mildew symptoms were reduced but not completely blocked by t <dig> treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptome analysis reported here represents a major contribution to the characterization of induced resistance mechanisms in a non-model plant. we used the rna-seq approach to characterize the transcriptional changes associated with the reduction of downy mildew symptoms in t39-treated grapevines and thereby established a foundation for a more detailed time-course analysis of induced resistance in grapevines. our data show that t <dig> directly activates microbial recognition mechanisms in absence of pathogen infection and enhances the expression of defence processes after p. viticola inoculation. reduction of downy mildew symptoms is related to inhibition of disease-related processes and activation of defence mechanisms after p. viticola inoculation of t39-treated plants. t39-induced resistance is associated with enhanced expression of specific genes related to resistance against downy mildew in wild grapevines, indicating that induced resistance can partially mimic defence processes of resistant genotypes. in addition, the genes identified in this work represent an important source of markers of resistance induction and can be used to select beneficial microorganisms with an improved ability to induce plant resistance. these markers can also be used to clarify how environmental conditions affect induced resistance.
