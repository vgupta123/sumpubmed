BACKGROUND
danio rerio is one of the few model organisms used to examine developmental regulation of vertebrate biological processes. much has been leaned regarding transcriptional control of organogenesis, including development and growth of the heart  <cit>  and brain  <cit> . although the zebrafish is often used to study vertebrate development, random mutagenesis screens have identified several important genes involved in physiology and behavior. the importance of ion channels is exemplified by mutants such as the slow mo mutant, which disrupts the heart rate due to changes in the pacemaker current   <cit> . another mutation in zebrafish, the lethal island beat , disrupts the α1c l-type ca2+ channel subunit, which regulate heart growth independently of effects on contractions  <cit> . the role of ion transporters and ca2+ homeostasis is further emphasized by the arrhythmias observed in tre embryos, which have a mutation of the na+-ca2+ exchanger  <cit> . the zebrafish may be an appropriate model for studying human inherited arrhythmias, for example in a recent study defining mutations of a delayed rectifier k+ current in contributing to long qt syndrome  <cit> . although the description and function of ion channels in zebrafish systems biology is beginning to emerge  <cit> , little is known about the expression and functional characteristics of most zebrafish ion channels.

in drosophila, shaker was the first type of k+ channel to be described  <cit> . this was soon followed by homology cloning of shab, shaw and shal  <cit> . many more voltage-activated k+ channels have since been described in mammals  <cit> , but the corresponding preferential mammalian nomenclature for these first four are kv <dig>  kv <dig>  kv <dig> and kv <dig>  <cit> , with several members in each of these subfamilies. the kv <dig> subfamily contains three members; kv <dig> , kv <dig>  and kv <dig>   <cit> . the kv <dig> x k+ channels are expressed in a variety of tissue, with particularly high levels in the brain and heart. the kv <dig> subunits form functional channels, with very similar biophysical and pharmacological properties, that are responsible for transient, voltage-dependent k+ currents in the nervous system  in the neuronal system. these somatodendritic subthreshold a-type k+ current in nerve cells contribute significantly to determine somatodendritic signal integration. the corresponding k+ current in the heart is called the transient outward k+ current , which contributes to action potential repolarization  <cit> .

shal-type k+ channel subunits are highly conserved evolutionary and are present even in primitive metazoans such as the jellyfish  <cit> . we show using sequence and phylogenetic analysis that orthologs of all three mammalian kv <dig> subfamily members exist in danio rerio. we collectively named these subunits zshals, in keeping with the nomenclature where "kv" is reserved for mammalian subunits  <cit> . we also describe the biophysical and pharmacological properties of zshal <dig> , as well as its regulation by the kv <dig> accessory subunit, ncs- <dig>  characterization of channel function and distribution is an important first step in understanding that the physiological role of ion channels in this model animal system.

methods
electrophysiological measurements in oocytes
stage v-vi oocytes were prepared from xenopus laevis and  <dig> nl of in vitro transcribed crna  were injected using a  <dig> μl micropipette . two to three days after the injection, oocytes were voltage-clamped using the standard two-electrode voltage-clamp technique as described previously  <cit> . recordings were obtained using a geneclamp  <dig> amplifier  with data sampled at  <dig> khz and filtered at  <dig> khz. currents were elicited by depolarizing steps from - <dig> to + <dig> mv in  <dig> mv increments every  <dig> s from a holding potential of - <dig> mv . the recording chamber was continually perfused . to avoid contamination with ca2+-activated cl- currents, a low cl- recording solution containing in  na-glutamate  <dig>  k-glutamate  <dig>  cacl <dig>  <dig> , mgcl <dig>  <dig>  hepes  <dig>  was used. all experiments were performed at room temperature .

data analysis
data were analyzed using the pclamp suite of software  and origin for windows . leak subtraction was not performed.

inactivation parameters
the time constants of inactivation were obtained by fitting the current traces to a sum of two exponential functions.

recovery from inactivation
a double pulse protocol was used to access the time course of recovery from inactivation. two depolarizing pulses to + <dig> mv were separated by intervals of increasing duration  at - <dig> mv. the peak current amplitude during the test pulse  was normalized to that recorded during the first pulse  and plotted as a function of the inter-pulse duration. curve fitting of the data points was performed to iio=imax⁡+a⋅e−tτ, where imax is the maximum current during the recovery time . a and τ are the relative amplitude and time constant respectively.

steady-state inactivation
a pre-pulse voltage protocol was used. the membrane was held at voltages ranging between - <dig> mv and - <dig> mv for a period of  <dig> seconds  followed by a  <dig> s test pulse to + <dig> mv, during which peak current amplitude  was measured. data were normalized to the peak current amplitude following a pre-pulse at - <dig> mv , and plotted as a function of pre-pulse potential. the line through the data represents the best nonlinear least-squares fit to a boltzmann function, iio=1), where vh is the voltage where half-maximal inactivation was observed and k is the slope factor.

normalized conductance-voltage curve
conductance  was calculated with the following equation: g = ipeak/, where ipeak is the peak current amplitude, e is the test potential and ek is the equilibrium potential for k+ . the conductance  was normalized to the maximal conductance at + <dig> mv  and plotted as a function of the test potential.

statistics
comparisons between two groups were performed using the student's t-test or the rank sum test. to test for overall significance when using more than two groups, we used the  <dig> way-anova or, when tests for normality failed, the non-parametric kruskall-wallis test . if the overall significance was obtained, multiple comparisons were performed to a control group respectively using the dunnet's t-test or dunn's test. values of p <  <dig>  were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
identification of zshal3
homology searches of the zebrafish est databases  <cit>  revealed an entry  with sequence similarity with the mammalian shal-related subunit, kv <dig> . we tentatively named this subunit zshal <dig>  we obtained the cdna and sequencing revealed the full-length zshal <dig> coding region, in addition to some 5'- and 3'- untranslated regions . the coding region is located on chromosome  <dig> . when translated, the amino-acid sequence of zshal <dig> is very similar to the mammalian kv4's. the sequence identity is respectively 77%, 73% and 65% with human kv <dig> , kv <dig>  and kv  <dig>  subunits . most divergence occurs in the intracellular n- and c-termini. important structural features of the mammalian kv <dig> subunits are conserved, including a six-transmembrane topology, a t <dig> domain and a k+ channel signature sequence. zshal <dig> also bears several putative consensus sequences for phosphorylation by pkc, as well as a single consensus sequence each for pka and tyrosine phosphorylation .

zshal <dig> corresponds to the short splice variant of mammalian kv <dig> . the long splice variant contains the sequence glsylvddpllsvrtstik within the intracellular c-terminus. we did not identify a genomic region on this zebrafish chromosome that translates to a similar sequence and it is unclear at this point whether zebrafish also generates two zshal <dig> splice variants.

biophysical characterization of zshal3
we injected xenopus oocytes with zshal <dig> crna and recorded currents 2– <dig> days post-injection. macroscopic two-electrode voltage clamp currents resembled those of kv <dig> -injected oocytes. upon depolarization zshal <dig> currents activated rapidly and inactivated with maintained depolarization . the inactivation time course is similar to that of mammalian kv <dig>  the time constants of fast and slow inactivation at + <dig> mv for zshal <dig> and kv <dig>  were, τfast =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms , τslow =  <dig> ±  <dig>  ms and  <dig> ±  <dig>  ms, respectively . zshal <dig> currents activated with depolarizations beyond - <dig> mv. the voltage at which half-maximal steady-state inactivation is achieved is - <dig> ±  <dig>  mv. recovery from inactivation was determined using a two-step voltage protocol and the time constant was  <dig> ms at - <dig> mv.

pharmacological blockade of zshal <dig> currents
kv <dig> currents are typically blocked by compounds such as 4-aminopyridine  and flecainide  <cit> . a comparison of effects of these compounds on kv <dig>  and zshal <dig> is shown in fig  <dig>  both currents were effectively blocked by high 4-ap concentrations . at low concentrations , 4-ap does not block kv <dig> currents . flecainide  also effectively blocked both kv <dig>  and zshal <dig> currents. these data demonstrate that structural elements required for channel block by these compounds are conserved between mammals and fish. in xenopus oocytes, we previously showed that kv <dig>  currents are time-dependently blocked by phorbol esters  <cit> . activating pkc with pma  led to a similar progressive inhibition of zshal currents . interestingly, before inhibition occurred, we consistently saw a slight activation of zshal currents. this was also often observed with mammalian kv4s .

modification of zshal <dig> by accessory subunits
in mammalian heterologous expression systems and in xenopus oocytes, kv <dig> current amplitudes are increased by co-expression with the accessory proteins, kchips and ncs- <dig>  these accessory subunits additionally slow the inactivation time course  <cit> . we examined the effects of ncs- <dig>  on zshal <dig> currents. as with kv <dig> currents, zshal <dig> currents were enhanced in oocytes co-injected with ncs- <dig> crna . the peak zshal <dig> currents with and without ncs- <dig> were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μa at + <dig> mv, respectively, . the increase in zshal <dig> currents occurred at all test potentials examined without a significant shift in voltage dependence of activation as shown in the normalized conductance-voltage relationships . ncs- <dig> also slowed the time course of zshal <dig> inactivation . the time constants of fast and slow inactivation at + <dig> mv for zshal <dig> currents with and without ncs- <dig> were τfast =  <dig> ±  <dig>  ms  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms , τslow =  <dig> ±  <dig> ms and  <dig> ±  <dig>  ms, respectively . as observed for kv <dig> channels  <cit> , there was no effect on the voltage-dependence of inactivation. the voltage at which half-maximal steady-state inactivation occurred  were - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv and - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv for zshal <dig> and zshal3/ncs- <dig> currents, respectively and the slope factors  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively; n =  <dig> for each experiment; fig 4e). a small but significant acceleration of recovery from inactivation was induced by ncs- <dig>  were  <dig>  ms and  <dig>  ms with and without ncs- <dig> respectively; fig 4f).

discussion
comparison with mammalian kv <dig> subunits
we identified a zebrafish homolog of the mammalian kv <dig>  subunit, which we named zshal <dig>  it has a high degree of sequence similarity  with members of the kv <dig> subfamily. within the transmembrane domains  and pore region the sequence similarity is much higher , suggesting evolutionary conservation of these regions responsible for channel function. the three mammalian kv <dig> subunits differ from each other in defined regions of the intracellular n- and c-termini. it is interesting that most of the sequence divergence between zshal <dig> and kv4's also occur in these regions, suggestive of subunit-specific roles of these divergent regions.

biophysical and pharmacological properties of zshal3
zshal <dig> behaved in most respects identically to mammalian kv <dig>  channels when expressed in xenopus oocytes. the "threshold" voltage for activation is around - <dig> mv, which is similar to kv <dig>  when expressed in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . this is not entirely surprising given the sequence similarity on the core region  of the polypeptides. once activated, zshal <dig> inactivates at rates similar to kv <dig> . the molecular mechanisms involved in kv <dig> inactivation are not well understood, but classic n-type  or c-type  inactivation may not occur. there may be a concerted interaction between the intracellular n- and c-termini in causing kv <dig>  inactivation  <cit>  and it is likely that a similar mechanism may operate to cause zshal <dig> inactivation. the similarities in voltage-dependence of inactivation and rates of recovery from inactivation further support the notion of evolutionary conserved inactivation mechanisms. the zshal subunit may be useful in further elucidating kv <dig> inactivation, which is thought to occur predominantly from a pre-open closed state  <cit> . pharmacologically, both zshal <dig> and kv <dig>  are blocked by 4-ap and flecainide. there is evidence that the 4-ap binding site is on the cytoplasmic surface of the kv <dig>  channel at, or adjacent to, the domains involved in channel inactivation  <cit> . flecainide sensitivity, in contrast, is mediated by a single residue in the s <dig> transmembrane domain of voltage-gated potassium channels  <cit> . this residue is l <dig> in the case of kv <dig> , which is conserved in zshal <dig> . because of this sequence conservation, it is likely that these compounds may also block zshal <dig> currents by interaction with these homologous residues. furthermore, as observed for kv <dig>  current  <cit> , zshal <dig> current was also largely modulated by pkc activation, suggesting that a similar functional role for signal transduction-mediated modulation of a-type current may exist in zebrafish.

modulation of zshal <dig> by accessory subunits
kchips and ncs- <dig>  strongly modulate kv <dig> currents by increasing their expression levels and slowing their inactivation  <cit> . since ncs- <dig> may be the evolutionary ancestor of the ca2+-binding protein family <cit> , we examined the effect of ncs- <dig> and found this kv <dig> accessory protein to affect zshal <dig> in an identical manner. kchips  bind to kv <dig> subunits by interacting with specific residues. a major interaction site for kchips binding within kv <dig>  lies within the n-terminus – particularly with the proximal n-terminal region  <cit> . the absolute conservation of residues and domains involved in interaction, despite divergence in other parts of the n-terminus, suggests an evolutionary conserved mechanism of modulation of shal  subunits by accessory subunits, which predates the vertebrate evolutionary branching point of mammals and fish. indeed, inspection of zebrafish genome suggests orthologs of at least some of the kchips , as well as a ncs- <dig> ortholog . it remains to be seen whether these zkchips or zncs- <dig> will have any influence on zshal currents.

other shal-related family members in zebrafish
there are three members in the mammalian kv <dig> subfamily . similarity searches of the zebrafish genome revealed homologs for each of these mammalian kv <dig> subunits. the putative subunits zshal <dig>  zshal <dig> and zshal <dig> are respectively located on zebrafish chromosomes  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  and correspond to kv <dig> , kv <dig>  and kv <dig> . the sequence similarity between zshals and kv4's are greater than observed with other mammalian kv subunits . given this high degree of sequence similarity, as well as the similarities in the functional and pharmacological properties between zshal <dig> and mammalian kv4's , it is expected that these additional zshal members will have biophysical and pharmacological properties resembling their mammalian orthologs. however, this prediction  still needs to be examined.

possible functional significance of zshal expression in zebrafish
without detailed electrophysiological recordings of native currents in zebrafish or in the absence of knockout experiments, it is not possible to determine the functional significance of zshal expression in the fish at this point. given the similarities in function and regulation of zshal to their mammalian orthologs , one would expect these channels to have similar functions in the fish as they do in the mammal. known functions of kv <dig> subunits in mammals include a role in somatodendritic subthreshold a-type k+ currents, which operate in the subthreshold range of membrane potentials  <cit>  and may be involved in determining the properties of dendritic, backpropagating action potentials and long-term potentiation  <cit> . preliminary whole-mount in-situ hybridization experiments suggest that zshal <dig> may be expressed in neural tissues of zebrafish embryos . depending on the protein distribution and dentritic localization of zshals, they may have similar functions. if any of the zshals  are expressed in the zebrafish heart, then by analogy with the mammalian heart, one would expect these subunits to give rise to a 'transient outward k+ current', which helps to determine action potential shape and cardiac contractile properties  <cit> . the regulation of zshals by accessory proteins such as ncs- <dig>  also suggests a similarity in how these channels are regulated in-vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a member of the shal subfamily of k+ channel subunits in zebrafish and named it zshal <dig>  since it appears to be the ortholog of the mammalian kv <dig>  subunit. we report the biophysical and pharmacological characterization of zshal <dig>  we demonstrate that zshal has similar functional and pharmacological characteristics compared to kv <dig>  and it is similarly regulated by pharmacological agents and by the kv <dig> accessory subunit, ncs- <dig>
