BACKGROUND
congenital anomalies remain a serious clinical problem, affecting over  <dig>  pregnancies per year in the uk, and  <dig>  pregnancies per year across europe  <cit> . amongst the most common forms of birth defect are those involving the cardiovascular or nervous systems, in around 30% and 10% of cases, respectively. basic research into the causes of birth defects is required, in order to enable progress in helping to prevent these disorders.

the mouse is an appropriate model organism for the study of many human birth defects, including nervous system and cardiovascular abnormalities. the developmental basis of mouse neural tube closure and heart formation mirrors that in human gestation, while the ability to genetically manipulate the mouse allows valuable experimental approaches. n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea  mutagenesis has proven a powerful method for the creation of novel mouse mutants that provide models of human birth defects. moreover, the random nature of single base substitutions generated by enu permits the formation of an allelic series of mutations at any locus, facilitating the determination of gene and protein function.

the central nervous system develops from the neural tube, an embryonic precursor that is formed early in human gestation, at around 24- <dig> days following conception. the morphological events of human neural tube formation are mirrored closely in the mouse, with a well characterised sequence of events that take place between embryonic day   <dig>  and  <dig>  of mouse development  <cit> . neural tube closure initiates at the base of the future hindbrain, termed closure  <dig>  at around the  <dig> somite stage. two further sites of closure initiation are observed at about the  <dig> somite stage, one near the forebrain-midbrain boundary  and the other at the rostral extent of the forebrain . continuation of closure between these points results in the completion of cranial closure by around the  <dig> somite stage, while progressive closure along the spine continues as the embryo elongates, with final closure at the posterior neuropore at about the  <dig> somite stage.

failure to complete the normal process of neural tube closure results in neural tube defects , which affect around  <dig> in  <dig> established pregnancies  <cit> . the type of neural tube defect depends on the region of the embryonic axis that is affected. anencephaly occurs following failure to complete closure in the head, while spina bifida results from disruption of posterior neuropore closure. failure of the initial event of neural tube closure  results in the most severe form of ntd, craniorachischisis, in which almost the entire brain and spinal cord remains open. anencephaly and craniorachischisis are invariably lethal, owing to the disruption of brain formation. cases of spina bifida are compatible with postnatal survival but often associated with lower body paralysis or dysfunction. craniorachischisis accounts for around 10% of ntd cases  <cit> .

studies with model organisms are essential in helping to elucidate the genetic, molecular and cellular defects that cause these congenital abnormalities which, in turn, provides the potential to identify and develop novel preventative therapies. over  <dig> mouse mutants are known with neural tube defects  <cit>  however relatively few of these exhibit the condition of craniorachischisis. indeed, mutations in only eleven genes leads to craniorachischisis, which makes the identification of novel mutants with this disorder of high scientific and clinical interest.

strikingly, amongst those mutants with craniorachischisis, almost all genes affect the planar cell polarity  signalling pathway, either directly or indirectly. the pcp pathway was first identified in drosophila, since disruption of the polarity of cells within an epithelial plane  leads to visible phenotypes that include disruption of the regular orientation of hairs on the wings and misorientated ommatidia in the eye. a set of proteins were defined as the core components of the pcp pathway, since they are required for pcp in multiple tissues. these core components include the transmembrane proteins, strabismus/van gogh, flamingo/starry night and frizzled , and the intracellular protein dishevelled . the pcp pathway is also known as the non-canonical wnt pathway, since it shares components  with the canonical wnt-Î²-catenin signalling pathway; however, the drosophila ligand for pcp remains unknown. several of the mouse craniorachischisis mutants affect genes that are homologues of these core pcp proteins, including vangl <dig> and vangl <dig> , celsr <dig> , frizzled and dishevelled  <cit> . these genes are required for planar cell polarity in mammals, as evidenced by disruption of the regular orientation of sensory hair cells within the cochlear epithelium in mutants for celsr <dig>  <cit> , vangl <dig>  <cit> , vangl1/vangl <dig>  <cit>  and fz3/fz <dig>  <cit> , and disruption of the planar arrangement of hair follicles in fz <dig>  <cit> , vangl <dig> and celsr <dig> mutants  <cit> . craniorachischisis is also observed following disruption of mouse scrib  <cit> . although originally defined as a gene involved in apical-basal polarity rather than planar polarity, several lines of evidence indicate that scribble affects pcp signalling; mouse scrib mutants demonstrate defects in pcp generation in the inner ear  <cit> , scrib demonstrates genetic and biochemical interactions with vangl <dig>  <cit>  and drosophila scrib has recently been shown to play a role in pcp  <cit> . similarly, ptk <dig> mutants exhibit craniorachischisis and pcp defects in the inner ear  <cit> . ptk <dig> mutant mice demonstrate a genetic interaction with vangl <dig>  <cit> , while xenopus ptk <dig> forms a complex with dishevelled and frizzled <dig>  <cit> . most recently, mutation of sec24b has been shown to cause craniorachischisis, and sec24b affects pcp through regulation of vangl <dig> protein trafficking  <cit> .

here, we report the identification of a new enu-induced mutant allele that we have named chuzhoi . homozygous chuzhoi mutants exhibit craniorachischisis, owing to failure to initiate neural tube closure in the future cervical region, closure  <dig>  we demonstrate that the phenotype of chuzhoi mutant embryos is consistent with a defect in convergent extension, with a broadened midline and reduced rate of increase in the length-to-width ratio of mutant embryos compared to wild-type. in addition, we demonstrate that chuzhoi mutants exhibit disruption of planar cell polarity in the inner ear, and exhibit a genetic interaction with both vangl <dig> and celsr <dig>  thus, chuzhoi mutants exhibit a number of key characteristics of a planar cell polarity mutant. we show that chuzhoi maps to the central region of chromosome  <dig>  and demonstrate that chuzhoi carries a splice site mutation in ptk <dig>  this mutation is predicted to cause the insertion of three extra amino acids into the ptk <dig> protein. chuzhoi mutants exhibit disruption of the expression of the ptk <dig> protein. this new mutant provides an additional genetic resource to help define the developmental role of the pcp pathway and the molecular function of ptk <dig> 

RESULTS
chuzhoi is a novel mutant with severe neural tube defects
chuzhoi arose during a screen for recessive enu-induced mutations that affect the morphology of mid-gestation embryos  <cit> . the mutant was identified through the presence of the severe neural tube defect of craniorachischisis, in which the neural tube was open from the midbrain/hindbrain boundary throughout the spinal cord . mutants exhibited a shortening and kinking of the body axis and some displayed ventral body wall closure defects , with protrusion of the guts and liver . mutants also commonly displayed failure of eyelid closure . skeletal preparations revealed splayed vertebrae in chuzhoi homozygotes, a consequence of the open neural tube defect, and clearly demonstrated a shortening and skewing of the spinal cord . skeletal preparations also demonstrated fusions and bifurcations of the ribs in chuzhoi mutants  and occasional  postaxial or preaxial polydactyly .

severe neural tube defects in chuzhoi are consistent with a defect in convergent extension
craniorachischisis occurs as a result of failure to initiate neural tube closure. examination of embryos over the time of closure  <dig>  revealed that in +/+ and chz/+ embryos neural tube closure was initiated at the 5- to 7-somite stage and, at e <dig> , only the posterior neuropore remained open . in contrast, chuzhoi homozygous mutant embryos failed to initiate neural tube closure at e <dig>  and, at e <dig> , although the forebrain was closed the rest of the neural tube was persistently open , even at later embryonic and fetal stages . several mouse mutants with craniorachischisis exhibit an abnormal, broadened morphology of the ventral midline of the neural plate at the stage and site of closure  <dig>  as seen in vangl2lp/lp  <cit> , scribcrc/crc  <cit> , celsr1crsh/crsh  mutants and the ptk <dig> gene trap allele  <cit> . this defect is thought to mechanically prevent closure  <dig> by placing the neural folds too far apart to appose and fuse  <cit> . we examined chuzhoi embryos in order to determine if this morphological defect is present. histological sections demonstrated a broadened morphology of the neuroepithelium in chuzhoi mutants, creating a u-shaped ventral midline that is distinct from the v-shaped midline observed in wild-type embryos . wholemount in situ hybridization with probes for brachyury and shh confirmed the wider structure of the floor plate and notochord, evident particularly in posterior embryonic regions, just anterior to the primitive streak . the morphology of the node appeared abnormal by e <dig>  , with a shortened anterior-posterior length and enlarged width in chuzhoi, while at e <dig>  no reproducible difference in node morphology was apparent between mutant and wild-type embryos .

the cause of the broadened midline in vangl2lp/lp mutants has been reported as a defect in the cellular process of convergent extension  <cit> . a defect in mesodermal convergent extension in the ptk <dig> gene trap allele has also been reported  <cit> . to assess convergent extension in chuzhoi mutants, we measured the length and width of embryos over the time of neurulation . we found a significant reduction in the rate of increase of the length/width ratio, in chuzhoi mutants compared to wild-type and heterozygous littermates . this is consistent with a disruption of convergent extension in the chuzhoi mutants. in contrast, other tissue and cellular characteristics were normal in chuzhoi mutants, including rates of cellular proliferation  and apical-basal polarity  within the neuroepithelium at the stage and site of closure  <dig> 

chuzhoi mutants exhibit disruption of planar cell polarity in the inner ear
mutants with craniorachischisis often disrupt regulation of planar cell polarity, evident most easily from disruption of the regular orientation of sensory hair cells within the cochlear epithelium. this prompted us to examine hair cell polarity in chuzhoi mutants. phalloidin staining revealed the typical wild-type pattern of three rows of outer hair cells  and one row of inner hair cells  with uniformly polarized arrangement of stereociliary bundles in the basal regions of the organ of corti from e <dig>  heterozygous fetuses . in contrast, basal cochlea regions of chuzhoi mutants exhibit disruption of the arrangement of the stereociliary bundles on the third row of outer hair cells , with randomised cell orientation. apical regions of the cochlea in heterozygous mice also conform to the normal arrangement of three rows of ohc and one row of ihc . however, chuzhoi homozygous mutants demonstrate a broadened region of ohc with four apparent rows of cells, plus also additional cells external to the row of inner hair cells . these data reveal that chuzhoi mutants have disruption of planar cell polarity in the inner ear.

chuzhoi mutants exhibit abnormal lung development
our recent observation of lung defects in other pcp mutants  <cit> , prompted us to examine lung morphology in chuzhoi mutants. chuzhoi mutants exhibited striking defects in lung development. at e <dig> , the lung lobes were reduced in size and highly misshapen  compared to wild-type littermates . histological examination of the lung lobes revealed thickened interstitial mesenchyme with infrequent septation, in homozygous chuzhoi mutants compared to wild-type littermates . these defects will result in reduced airway space, and this would be expected to cause breathing difficulties after birth, though this is impossible to determine since mutants die at birth from the severe neural tube defects. notably, the chuzhoi lung phenotype is similar to that observed in other mutants with craniorachischisis, including vangl2lp/lp, celsr1crsh/crsh  <cit> , and scribcrc/crc .

chuzhoi mutants exhibit abnormal heart development
several mouse mutants with craniorachischisis also exhibit heart defects, prompting us to examine chuzhoi mutants for cardiac malformations. seven chuzhoi homozygous embryos were examined at e <dig>  for cardiovascular abnormalities. of these, five had obvious malformations affecting the outflow region of the heart. in normal hearts, the aorta exits from the left ventricle  whereas the pulmonary trunk, which gives rise to the pulmonary arteries, exits from the right ventricle . in contrast, in three chuzhoi embryos, the defect of double outlet right ventricle was observed, whereby both the aorta and the pulmonary trunk exit from the right ventricle . this was found, in each case, in association with a ventricular septal defect . in the remaining two cases, the connections between the ventricles and the great arteries were concordant, although the vessels were parallel rather than spiralling round one another. interestingly, in three out of seven hearts examined, the pulmonary arteries, and to a lesser extent the pulmonary veins, were abnormally dilated ; this did not correlate with the presence of double outlet right ventricle.

the phenotype of double outlet right ventricle in the vangl2lp/lp mutant is attributed, at least in part, to gross abnormalities in embryo morphology, with incomplete embryonic turning and abnormal heart looping. we examined chuzhoi mutant embryos for a similar defect. abnormalities in cervical flexure are observed in homozygous vangl2lp/lp mutants  <cit> . similarly, a pronounced reduction in cervical flexure was evident in chuzhoi mutant embryos, compared to wild-type littermates . at e <dig> , positioning of the developing heart appeared to be abnormal in chuzhoi homozygous mutants. the looping of the heart is reduced, but this may be a secondary consequence of the incomplete embryonic turning and consequent abnormal malformation of the embryo; the angle of the malformed heart is similar to the angle of the forelimb buds, in both wild-type and mutant embryos . we propose that the defects in cardiovascular development may, at least in part, be secondary to defects in early heart morphological changes, which may themselves be caused by defects in embryonic turning. the observed kinking of the body axis at later stages, noted above  is also indicative of incomplete embryonic turning.

chuzhoi mutants exhibit minor defects in neural crest cell distribution
heart defects can arise owing to abnormal neural crest cell specification or migration, prompting us to examine neural crest cell distribution in chuzhoi mutant embryos. sox <dig> is expressed in neural crest cells as they emerge from the dorsal side of the neural tube and in derivatives including cranial and dorsal root ganglia   <cit> . examination of sox <dig> expression demonstrated the presence of migrating neural crest cells in chuzhoi mutant embryos, although their distribution appeared abnormal. in the branchial region, chuzhoi mutants exhibited an apparent fusion of the ninth and tenth cranial ganglia , while the trigeminal ganglion appeared enlarged and misshapen . the distribution of neural crest cells in the spinal region also appeared abnormal, with a narrower domain of sox <dig> expression and disturbance of the normal v-shaped arrangement of cells . this may be a consequence of the altered morphology of the somites and dorsal root ganglia in the mutant embryos. the anomalies in sox <dig> expression pattern suggest that although there are some defects in neural crest cell distribution, there is no substantial defect in neural crest cell migration. this conclusion is further supported by several additional observations in chuzhoi mutant embryos, including: the presence of approximately normally sized thymic rudiments; comparable sox <dig> expression patterns in neural crest derivatives; normal Î±-smooth muscle actin staining in the outflow tract at e <dig> , and normal outflow tract septation .

chuzhoi genetically interacts with vangl2lp and celsr1crsh but not scribcrc
the chuzhoi mutants exhibit phenotypic similarity with other mouse mutants, including vangl2lp/lp, scribcrc/crc and celsr1crsh/crsh. all four mutants exhibit craniorachischisis and defects in eyelid closure, while a ventral closure defect is observed with high penetrance in scribcrc/crc and lower penetrance in both vangl2lp/lp and celsr1crsh/crsh  <cit> . we have previously reported that vangl2lp and scribcrc genetically interact, such that doubly heterozygous fetuses exhibit craniorachischisis  <cit> . similarly, vangl2lp and celsr1crsh genetically interact, as do scribcrc and celsr1crsh; in both cases, a proportion of doubly heterozygous embryos demonstrate severe neural tube defects . the ptk <dig> gene trap allele demonstrates a genetic interaction with vangl2lp  <cit> . these results prompted us to test for a genetic interaction between chuzhoi and other mutants with craniorachischisis. heterozygous chuzhoi mice were intercrossed with either vangl2lp/+, scribcrc/+ or celsr1crsh/+ heterozygotes, and embryos examined for a mutant phenotype. in all cases, the proportion of double mutants obtained followed expected mendelian ratios . the phenotypes and penetrance of interactions varied markedly, between mutants. while in all cases, the majority of doubly heterozygous embryos were phenotypically normal , a proportion of vangl2lp/+;chz/+ embryos exhibited spina bifida  or craniorachischisis , while some doubly heterozygous celsr1crsh/+; chz/+ embryos displayed spina bifida . in contrast, the doubly heterozygous scribcrc/+ ; chz/+ embryos were all phenotypically normal . the range of phenotypes, and the penetrance of these defects, is distinct to that observed for intercrosses between other craniorachischisis mutants, such as vangl2lp/+; scribcrc/+  <cit>  and vangl2lp/+; celsr1crsh/+ . the variation of phenotypes and penetrance may be partly attributed to genetic background effects. nevertheless, the observation of an interaction between chuzhoi and both vangl2lpand celsr1crsh suggests that the gene disrupted in chuzhoi plays a role in modifying pcp signalling in the mammalian embryo.

chuzhoi carries a splice site mutation in ptk <dig> generating a three amino acid insertion
genetic mapping using a genome-wide panel of  <dig> snp markers on  <dig> affected individuals revealed linkage to chromosome  <dig> . analysis with additional microsatellite markers and increased numbers of affected individuals refined the critical region to  <dig> mb . this region contains many genes, including ptk <dig>  since a gene trap allele of ptk <dig> exhibits similar phenotypes to chuzhoi  <cit>  we examined ptk <dig> in this mutant. sequencing of cdna revealed a nine nucleotide insertion in the ptk <dig> transcript in chuzhoi mutants  while analysis of chuzhoi genomic dna identified a single nucleotide substitution at the 3' end of ptk <dig> intron nine . this intron is of the gt-ag subtype, and the mutation creates a splice acceptor site with closer similarity to the consensus sequence  <cit>  than the wild-type . the new splice acceptor site in chuzhoi results in the nine nucleotide insertion in the transcript which encodes three amino acids in the ptk <dig> protein . following breeding of chuzhoi to congenicity, all phenotypically abnormal embryos  genotype as homozygous mutant for ptk <dig>  supporting this mutation as being causative for the craniorachischisis phenotype. moreover the colony is maintained by genotyping at the ptk <dig> mutation, with no observed recombination events between this and the chuzhoi mutant phenotype. thus, despite over  <dig> opportunities for meiotic recombination, chuzhoi has not segregated from the ptk <dig> mutation providing further support to our hypothesis that disruption of ptk <dig> is causative for the chuzhoi mutant phenotype.

mouse ptk <dig> encodes a type ia transmembrane protein of  <dig> amino acids with seven extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and an intracellular kinase homology domain  <cit> . analysis by western blotting with an antibody raised against the extracellular domain of ptk <dig> detects two isoforms, of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda  <cit> . since experimental analyses give no evidence for alternative splicing of mouse ptk <dig>  <cit> , and there is annotation of only a single transcript in ensembl , the  <dig> kda band is likely to be full length n-glycosylated ptk <dig> protein while the smaller isoform may be a cleavage product  <cit> . the splicing mutation in chuzhoi is predicted to insert the three amino acids alanine-asparagine-proline into the protein, after the fifth ig-like domain . western blot analysis revealed a change in abundance of ptk <dig> in the mutant embryos. in chuzhoi embryos at e <dig> , abundance of the full length protein was slightly increased but, more significantly, abundance of the smaller isoform was markedly reduced, relative to wild-type littermates  although ptk <dig> remains entirely in the membrane fraction of protein extracts. at earlier embryonic stages, around the time of initiation of neural tube closure, the expression of ptk <dig> was reduced relative to later embryonic stages and, more notably, the abundance of the smaller isoform was reduced relative to the larger isoform . nevertheless, the abundance of the smaller isoform was detectably decreased in chuzhoi homozygous mutants . this demonstrates that the insertion in ptk <dig> in chuzhoi mice causes a detectable change in the ptk <dig> protein. together, the mapping, phenotyping, genotyping and protein data provide strong evidence to support our hypothesis that chuzhoi is a new allele of ptk <dig> 

ptk <dig> expression coincides with regions of phenotypic defects in chuzhoi
we examined the expression of ptk <dig> in neurulation stage embryos by wholemount in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. as reported previously  <cit> , ptk <dig> rna was first detected at the caudal end of embryos, during head fold and early somite stages . at the 4-somite stage, immediately prior to closure  <dig>  ptk <dig> continued to be expressed most intensely at the caudal end of the embryo, while lower levels of expression were detected elsewhere, including the neuroepithelium and somites . intense caudal staining continued at later stages, with less intense staining evident elsewhere . ptk <dig> encodes a transmembrane protein, and immunostaining with an anti-ptk <dig> antibody detects ptk <dig> within the cell membrane  <cit> . immunofluoresence on transverse sections of 4-somite stage embryos detected ptk <dig> within the cell membranes of both the neuroepithelium and mesenchyme . in contrast, we observed a significant reduction in membrane localization of ptk <dig> in the chuzhoi mutant . it is important to note that in chuzhoi mutants, some ptk <dig> protein can still localize to the membrane; however, the protein levels are much reduced. the chuzhoi mutant images  required longer exposure times  than wild-type sections  in order to provide broadly comparable photographs, in keeping with the reduced expression detectable by western blotting. the difference observed in chuzhoi mutants adds further support to the argument that chuzhoi mutation affects the ptk <dig> gene.

at later embryonic stages, ptk <dig> mrna was detected in several other tissues, including the eyelid epithelium  and, most intensely, in the lung epithelium , while sense controls gave no detectable staining . expression of ptk <dig> in eyelid epithelium correlates with the defect in eyelid closure observed in chuzhoi mutants and the ptk <dig> gene-trapped allele  <cit> . notably, several other pcp genes are expressed in the eyelid epithelium, including vangl <dig>  scrib and celsr <dig>  and mutants for these genes also exhibit eyelid closure defects  <cit> . expression in the lung epithelium is consistent with defects observed in lung development and, again, mirrors the lung expression of vangl <dig>  scrib and celsr <dig> 

chuzhoi mutants show no alteration in the stability or localization of vangl <dig> or celsr <dig>  and ptk <dig> protein shows no disruption in vangl <dig> or celsr <dig> mutants
we examined the expression of ptk <dig> protein in vangl2lp/lp, celsr1crsh/crsh and scribcrc/crc homozygous mutant embryos at the time of onset of neural tube closure, by western blotting. at this embryonic stage, most ptk <dig> protein appeared to be present as the full length form, with barely detectable levels of cleaved isoform. no difference in overall amounts of ptk <dig> were observed in any of the mutants, compared to their heterozygous and wild-type littermates . we examined the cleavage of ptk <dig> in vangl2lp/lp, celsr1crsh/crsh and scribcrc/crc mutants, by repeating the western analysis with e <dig>  embryos. no difference in the proportion of full length and cleaved isoforms was observed in any of the mutants, compared to their wild-type littermates, and both isoforms were retained in the membrane fraction in all cases . in addition, we examined the expression of scrib, vangl <dig> and celsr <dig> in chuzhoi mutant embryos, at the time of initiation of neural tube closure. no observable difference was apparent between the amount of scrib, vangl <dig> or celsr <dig> protein expressed in chuzhoi homozygous embryos, compared to wild-type littermates . therefore the interaction between chuzhoi and vangl2lp and celsr1crsh appears to be mediated by changes other than expression levels of the proteins.

the genetic interaction may alternatively be mediated through changes in the subcellular localisation of the proteins. we assessed this possibility by immunofluorescence. ptk <dig> was detected in the cell membranes of both neuroepithelium and mesoderm in wild-type embryos immediately prior to the onset of neurulation . a similar distribution of ptk <dig> was detected in both celsr1crsh/crsh and vangl2lp/lp mutants at this stage , with no obvious defect in ptk <dig> localisation. we also examined the expression of vangl <dig> and celsr <dig> in chuzhoi mutants by immunofluorescence. celsr <dig> appears to be restricted to the neuroepithelial cell plasma membrane in wild-type embryos preceding initiation of neural tube closure , and this distribution was observed in chuzhoi homozygous mutant embryos . vangl <dig> protein in wild-type embryos was also localised predominantly in the plasma membrane of the neuroepithelial cells, with an apparent enrichment along apical membranes . in a number of embryos, we observed an apparent decrease in vangl <dig> protein localisation at the apical membrane , but this difference was not always reproducible and other embryos appeared normal. scrib localisation appeared similar in wild-type and chuzhoi mutants . on balance, while other subtle defects may have remained undetected, these data suggest that the interaction between chuzhoi, crsh and lp is mediated neither by changes in levels of protein expression nor by alterations in protein localisation.

discussion
chuzhoi is a new mouse mutant revealing further evidence for function of the pcp pathway in neural tube closure
investigating the function of any gene is greatly helped by the existence of multiple mutant alleles of that gene. enu treatment of mice has proven to be a powerful method for generating new mutations and, since enu introduces random, single nucleotide changes, it provides a diverse array of alleles, including nonsense, missense and splice site mutations. these alleles encode a rich resource of genetic defects, often with a spectrum of phenotypic abnormalities that range from complete nulls, through hypomorphs to gain-of-function alleles. an allelic series of genetic mutants is a valuable resource in elucidating the function of the protein.

chuzhoi is a novel mouse mutant that arose from an enu screen. we have demonstrated that chuzhoi maps to the central region of chromosome  <dig>  and show that chuzhoi mutants contain a splice site mutation that results in a three amino acid insertion in the extracellular domain of ptk <dig>  while we have not fully excluded the possibility that other mutations in the critical interval might contribute to the chuzhoi phenotype, we have a number of pieces of evidence to strongly support ptk <dig> as a very good candidate for the chuzhoi mutation. the chuzhoi mutant exhibits a number of phenotypes that were previously reported for a gene trap allele of ptk <dig>  <cit>  including craniorachischisis, abdominal closure defects and eyelid closure defects. in addition, we document abnormal planar cell polarity in the inner ear; both the misorientation of ohc <dig> cells, and the disrupted arrangement of the rows of ohc and ihc are highly reminiscent of that reported for the ptk <dig> gene trap allele  <cit> . moreover, we have found a disruption in ptk <dig> protein expression in the chuzhoi mutants.

chuzhoi mutants exhibit the severe neural tube defect of craniorachischisis, owing to failure to initiate neural tube closure. notably, almost all other mutants with this defect affect genes involved in the pcp pathway. these include those that affect the "core" pcp genes, including vangl <dig>  vangl1/vangl <dig>  celsr <dig>  frizzled3/frizzled <dig>  dishevelled1/dishevelled <dig> and dishevelled2/dishevelled <dig>  <cit> . disruption of wnt5a can also lead to craniorachischisis, and wnt5a genetically interacts with vangl <dig> mutants  <cit> . other mutants with craniorachischisis are not "core" pcp genes, but genetically interact with the pcp pathway, such as scrib  <cit> and the sfrp1/sfrp2/sfrp <dig> triple mutants  <cit> . craniorachischisis occurs following mutation of sec24b, a protein recently shown to affect membrane localisation of vangl <dig>  <cit> . failure of neural tube closure is seen also in mouse mutants for smurf1/smurf <dig>  which affect pcp signalling by interacting with phosphorylated dishevelled and par <dig>  leading to the localised ubiquitination and degradation of prickle  <cit> . zic2/zic <dig> double mutants exhibit craniorachischisis though this may be a result of exencephaly and severe spina bifida, rather than a failure of closure 1; genetic interaction between zic mutants and the pcp pathway has not been assessed  <cit> . only a single mouse mutant, chato , demonstrates failure of closure  <dig>  in a pcp-independent manner  <cit> . however, the phenotype is more severe than observed in other closure  <dig> mutants, with very short and broad axes, notochord irregularities distinct from those of the pcp mutants, disruption of heart formation and death at around e <dig>   <cit> .

the phenotype of chuzhoi is very similar to that of other pcp mutants and therefore likely indicates a role within the pcp pathway. indeed, our documentation of polarity defects in the cochlea provide direct evidence that chuzhoi disrupts the pcp signalling pathway. in addition, we have demonstrated a genetic interaction between chuzhoi and mutants in two core pcp genes, celsr <dig> and vangl <dig>  thus our novel mutant provides additional evidence linking pcp disruption to failure of neural tube closure.

in mutants exhibiting the craniorachischisis phenotype, early embryos display a defect in their morphology, with broadened neural folds, and this defect is thought to preclude neural tube closure by mechanically placing the neural folds too far apart to appose  <cit> . we show that chuzhoi mutants similarly exhibit a broadened midline defect, with a u-shaped rather than v-shaped ventral midline and broadened domains of shh and brachyury expression. the broadened midline defect is thought to arise as a result of disruption of convergent extension, a process first documented in frogs and fish, whereby cell rearrangement and intercalation in the mesoderm and neuroepithelium contributes to narrowing and lengthening of the embryo in a process dependent on the pcp pathway  <cit> . recent time-lapse live imaging studies have demonstrated convergent extension in mouse embryos, with cell intercalation in the axial mesoderm immediately anterior to the node at e <dig>   <cit> . moreover a defect in convergent extension in embryos prior to neurulation has been documented in vangl2lp/lp  <cit> , sfrp1/sfrp2/sfrp <dig> triple  <cit>  and par <dig> mutants  <cit> , while convergent extension defects of the cochlea are observed in vangl2lp/lp, dishevelled1/dishevelled <dig>  <cit>  and wnt5a mutants  <cit> . the ptk <dig> gene trap allele has recently been shown to have defective convergent extension cell movements in the mesoderm  <cit> . we demonstrate here that the chuzhoi mutant embryos have a reduced rate of increase of their length-to-width ratio, compared to wild-type littermates, consistent with disruption of convergent extension.

disruption of heart and lung development in chuzhoi mutants
the chuzhoi mutant exhibits a number of phenotypic similarities to the ptk <dig> gene trap allele  <cit>  and, in addition, exhibits abnormalities in heart and lung development not reported for the ptk <dig> gene trap allele. chuzhoi mutants exhibit defects in the heart including double outlet right ventricle  with a ventricular septal defect , or parallel arterial trunks. several other pcp mutants exhibit cardiovascular defects, though the range of defects is only partially overlapping. vangl2lp/lp and celsr1crsh/crsh mutants exhibit dorv and vsd as fully penetrant defects  <cit>  while scribcrc/crc mutants exhibit dorv in only a proportion  of embryos examined  <cit> . dorv is observed in some dishevelled mutants, including 38% of dvl2-/-, 36% of dvl3-/-, 38% of dvl1-/-;dvl2-/- and 32% of dlv2+/-;dvl3+/- mutants, while others exhibit persistent truncus arterious, in which the outflow tract fails to divide into the aorta and pulmonary artery  <cit> . the common defects suggest the chuzhoi mutation may affect pcp-dependent processes in heart development. however, chuzhoi mutants also exhibit dilation of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein, a phenotype not reported in other pcp mutants, suggesting that ptk <dig> has additional, perhaps pcp-independent, roles in development. it is notable that disruption of off-track  causes abnormal heart development  <cit> , supporting our hypothesis that the chuzhoi phenotype is caused by disruption of ptk <dig> 

the origin of the cardiovascular defects in chuzhoi mutants remains to be experimentally determined. abnormal positioning of the great arteries, including dorv, is thought to result from defects in outflow tract  rotation during heart development  <cit> . evidence for abnormal oft rotation is supported by the observation of parallel arterial trunks in chuzhoi mutants. in vangl2lp/lp, the cardiac alignment defects are attributed in part to abnormalities in cardiac looping  <cit> , as well as defects in myocardialization of the outflow tract cushions  <cit> , which may also affect oft rotation. defects in neural crest cell contribution can affect oft rotation  <cit>  and, indeed, neural crest cells may provide the initiating signal for myocardialization  <cit> . however, although ptk <dig> is important for neural crest cell migration in xenopus  <cit> , we found that chuzhoi mutants demonstrate only minor abnormalities in neural crest cell distribution in the cranial or spinal regions, and these are likely secondary to the abnormal embryo morphology. in contrast, chuzhoi mutants have incomplete embryonic turning, and this defect may cause abnormal looping of the developing heart, with consequential effects on oft rotation and alignment. indeed, in chick embryos, sirna disruption of off-track causes failure of bending of the heart loop and abnormal expansion of the ventricular region  <cit> .

chuzhoi genetically interacts with vangl2lp and celsr1crsh but not with scribcrc
the genetic experiments reported here demonstrate an interaction between chuzhoi and vangl2lp, and between chuzhoi and celsr1crsh. the difference in the penetrance of phenotypes in the two crosses may be partly attributable to genetic background effects, since celsr1crsh is congenic on balb/c, whereas vangl2lp and chuzhoi are congenic on c3h/heh. background variation may also account, in part, for the different results obtained for the cross between ptk <dig> gene trap allele and vangl2lp/+ reported previously  <cit>  and the cross between chuzhoi and vangl2lp/+ reported here. the former cross involved a genetic background of approximately 75% c57bl/ <dig>  25% c3h/he in doubly heterozygous individuals and 94% exhibited spina bifida  <cit> . in contrast, the genetic background of our intercross was almost 100% c3h/heh. a high proportion of c57bl/ <dig> in the embryos may increase the severity and penetrance of the mutant phenotype; indeed, this is supported by the observation of spina bifida in single loop-tail heterozygotes  <cit> . an increased penetrance of the ntd phenotype on c57bl/ <dig> compared to c3h backgrounds is seen in other mutants, including vacuolated lens  <cit>  and circletail .

the evidence of a genetic interaction between chuzhoi and both vangl2lp and celsr1crsh indicate that chuzhoi can influence the pcp pathway, although the molecular mechanism of this interaction remains unclear. we have demonstrated that the expression level and membrane localization of ptk <dig> are not detectably disrupted by mutation of either vangl <dig> or celsr <dig> and, similarly, celsr <dig> expression and localization appear unaltered in chuzhoi mutants. we have some data to suggest that vangl <dig> localisation may be subtly altered in chuzhoi mutants, with a reduction in protein at the apical membrane. xenopus ptk <dig> has been shown to localize dishevelled to the plasma membrane, by forming a complex with dishevelled and frizzled <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that mammalian ptk <dig> might act in the pcp pathway in a similar way, perhaps forming a complex involving dishevelled, frizzled, vangl <dig>  and celsr <dig>  <cit>  although detailed biochemical studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. however, disruption of ptk <dig> does not alter dvl <dig> localisation  <cit> . moreover, yeast 2-hybrid experiments with the intracellular domain of mouse ptk <dig> as bait against three different libraries isolated neither dishevelled nor frizzled, nor other members of the pcp pathway . further experiments are required to ascertain the precise molecular function of mammalian ptk <dig> 

we did not detect a genetic interaction between scribcrc and chuzhoi. while we cannot fully exclude genetic background effects, since both scribcrc and chuzhoi are congenic on c3h/heh , we believe that genetic background does not play a large contribution to the absence of mutant phenotype in the scrib/chuzhoi double heterozygotes. rather, we suggest that the absence of an observed genetic interaction between scribcrc and chuzhoi implies that scrib and ptk <dig> may affect the pcp signalling pathway through distinct mechanisms.

a number of mutants demonstrate a trans-heterozygous interaction with vangl2lp mice, and this is commonly used as evidence for a function within the pcp pathway. the vangl2lp mutation is semi-dominant, and vangl2lp/+ mice exhibit a number of disorders including delayed closure of the neural tube  <cit> . this delay means that vangl2lp/+ embryos are more sensitive than wild-type strains to embryonic conditions, so that sub-optimal environmental or genetic conditions that alone have no observable effect, may cause an ntd phenotype when crossed to vangl2lp/+. it is possible, therefore, that apparent genetic interactions can occur as a result of non-specific effects on embryonic conditions, rather than from a molecular pathway intersection. in this regard, it will be important to ascertain additional  data to confirm interaction specificity.

molecular function of ptk <dig> protein
ptk <dig> is similar to the receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family of proteins, with seven extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane motif and an intracellular kinase homology domain. however, the kinase homology domain lacks the dfg triplet that is necessary for the chelation of mg2+ during phosphotransfer and required for kinase activity  <cit> . ptk <dig> is therefore thought to encode a pseudokinase, lacking catalytic function. although other proteins lacking the dfg motif have been found to have kinase activity through the use of an alternative motif  <cit> , experimental evidence confirms that mammalian ptk <dig> lacks kinase activity and is not phosphorylated in cell culture  <cit> . ptk <dig> orthologues in hydra  and chicken  also lack kinase activity  <cit> . in contrast, the drosophila homologue of ptk <dig> , mediates calcium-dependent homophilic binding, and is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in cultured cells  <cit> . ptk <dig> has been proposed to be part of an unusual receptor tyrosine kinase signalling mechanism involving transmembrane domain-mediated interactions rather than kinase activity  <cit> , or to mediate signal attenuation  <cit> . the transmembrane domains of the ptk <dig> family are unusually highly conserved, across evolution, and this has been argued to support an important role for this domain  <cit> . notably, the kinase-like domain of xenopus ptk <dig> is required for the physical interaction of ptk <dig> with dishevelled  <cit> .

ptk <dig> protein exists as at least two isoforms in mouse
western blotting of mouse ptk <dig> detects two isoforms, of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda, using an anti-ptk <dig> rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the extracellular domain of ptk <dig>  <cit> . although human ptk <dig> encodes five alternatively spliced variants  <cit> , there is no evidence for alternative splicing of mouse ptk <dig>  an alternative hypothesis is that ptk <dig> undergoes protein cleavage. intriguingly, generation of the extracellular domain of human ptk <dig> as a soluble fusion protein gives rise to a band of approximately  <dig> kda  <cit> , similar in size to the lower band observed endogenously and raising the possibility of juxtamembrane cleavage of ptk <dig>  juxtamembrane cleavage of other type i transmembrane proteins commonly involves adam proteases  <cit> , but this ectodomain cleavage event usually results in the production of a soluble factor  <cit> . in contrast, the smaller isoform of ptk <dig> remains within the membrane fraction of cells, indicating that this putatively cleaved isoform is not freely soluble but remains either integral to the membrane or closely associated with membrane proteins. comprehensive biochemical experiments are required to elucidate the precise basis of the two isoforms observed by western blotting, and to investigate the possible existence of an intracellular fragment following cleavage.

regardless of the precise mechanism of formation of the lower molecular weight isoform, it is intriguing that chuzhoi mutants reveal decreased abundance of this smaller isoform on western blots. since the insertional mutation in chuzhoi occurs between the fifth and sixth immunoglobulin domains, this cannot directly disrupt a juxtamembrane cleavage site, although it may inhibit cleavage indirectly, for example, by protein misfolding. alternatively, the chuzhoi mutation may result in reduced stability of the smaller isoform. the reduced abundance of the smaller isoform in chuzhoi raises the possibility that this may be the biologically active moeity. however, the relative abundance of the smaller isoform is much reduced at earlier embryonic stages, including at the onset of neurulation, arguing against this hypothesis. an alternative suggestion is that the insertion in chuzhoi disrupts function of the full length ptk <dig> protein through protein misfolding. further biochemical studies on the protein function may help to distinguish between these possibilities.

CONCLUSIONS
our results with a new mouse mutant provide additional evidence that disruption of the planar cell polarity signalling pathway causes defects in neural tube, heart and lung development. this mutant provides a new genetic tool to help investigate the function of the pcp pathway and the precise molecular role of the likely candidate gene product, ptk <dig> protein.
