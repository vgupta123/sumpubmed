BACKGROUND
posidonia oceanica  delile  is a mediterranean endemism. plants colonize soft bottoms producing large meadows that span from the sea surface to 35– <dig> m depth. meadows are highly productive ecosystems, as they produce high amount of oxygen and organic compounds, sustain complex food nets, act as a nursery/refuge for several species. they also play a crucial role in coastal preservation, by stabilizing sediments and reducing hydrodynamics effects   <cit> .

many human activities and natural events are responsible for the widespread meadows regression, such as modified hydrogeological regime and littoral transport  <cit> , pollution  <cit> , aquaculture  <cit> , trawling  <cit> , anchorages  <cit> , placing of cable/pipes or damping  <cit> , in addition to grazing, sea storms, climatic changes, etc.  <cit> . all lead to alterations of posidonia ecosystems.

phenolic compounds are widespread secondary metabolites in plants. they play a role in herbivore/pathogen protection  <cit>  and are considered stress indicators in terrestrial plants  <cit> . phenols compounds have been identified in marine phanerogames  <cit>  and high concentrations of phenolic compounds in posidonia leaves were found in a few cases a) under competition with caulerpa taxifolia  <cit> , b) under mercury contamination  <cit> , c) nearby offshore aquaculture cages  <cit> . an attempt to identify specific phenolic compounds in posidonia leaves in response to different environmental pressures did not give clear-cut results  <cit> . this may be due to the fact that posidonia leaves are temporary structures with a relatively short lifespan  at the mediterranean mid-latitudes. therefore they show marked seasonal fluctuations in common physiological processes – including synthesis and accumulation of phenolic compounds  <cit> . rhizomes have a lifespan much longer than leaves: consequently, they undergo less marked fluctuations and may carry the memory of experienced environmental pressures.

the 2-d electrophoresis protein analysis produces maps of all the expressed proteins, in a given time and under a specific environmental condition. the protein pattern is a dynamic entity varying from cell to cell in the same organism, it is constantly modulated by external and internal signalling and reflects changes in the physiological state. the proteomic approach, based on the simultaneous separation of hundreds of proteins in the same 2d-electrophoretic gel, represents a powerful tool to monitor the "health state" of ecosystems, by comparing quantitative/qualitative pattern differences of protein expression in organisms living in polluted/non-polluted areas.

in this work we choose the rhizome, in particular the basal section, as the most reliable plant portion to evaluate possible alterations of both phenols content and protein expression.

the aim of this study was to verify the feasibility of phenols quantification coupled to 2-d electrophoretic protein analysis in rhizomes, as a novel "diagnostic" tool to monitor posidonia meadows conservation status.

RESULTS
phenols content
total phenols were measured in distal, intermediate and basal sections of sampled rhizomes. mean value  of the distal sections was  <dig>   ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  intermediate sections mean was  <dig>   ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and basal sections mean was  <dig>   from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

data of total phenols content in samples collected in  <dig> from the s. marinella meadow were compared to data previously obtained with identical experimental procedure from rhizomes of the same meadow collected in  <dig> and from rhizomes of the talamone meadow . samples from the well preserved meadow of talamone  <cit>  showed the lowest and less scattered phenols values, samples from the s. marinella meadow  showed highly scattered values . we found that the overall phenols content in s. marinella- <dig> samples was lower than the content detected in  <dig> samples, however in both cases values were higher than the ones obtained from the talamone samples .

phenols content differences between talamone and s. marinella- <dig> samples are statistically significant for all the sections , differences between s. marinella- <dig> and s. marinella- <dig> samples are highly significant for basal and intermediate sections , significant for the distal section . the lowest phenols content may be consistently associated with the good health state of the talamone meadow  <cit> .

in this study on the s. marinella meadow the three lowest phenols contents found in rhizome basal sections were:  <dig>  mg/g ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  mg/g ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/g ±  <dig> ; the three highest were:  <dig>  mg/g ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  mg/g ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/g ±  <dig> . posidonia shoots from these six sampling sites were chosen for protein analyses.

protein analysis
in order to assess a possible match between different phenols content and variations in protein expression, at first we determined the overall expression pattern of posidonia rhizome by 2-d electrophoresis. the polypeptides falling within the experimental window of pi 3– <dig> and 12– <dig> kda and sufficiently abundant to be detected by the silver staining procedure were taken into account. protein patterns from low and high phenols samples were combined and the experimental values of pi and molecular weight for each isoelectric spot were calculated by a dedicated computer software using reference proteins with known pi and molecular weight, commonly called "anchors" . proteins, accounting for a total of  <dig> spots, ranged from pi  <dig>  to pi  <dig>  with an apparent molecular weight ranging from  <dig> da to  <dig> da .

two representative 2-d gels from low and high phenols are shown in fig.  <dig>  computer-assisted cross-comparison revealed qualitative differences that accounted for differentially expressed proteins:  <dig> spots are peculiar of low phenols whereas  <dig> spots characterize high phenols samples, accounting for  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the entire map, respectively. these differences were consistently found in all the examined samples.

at low phenols content, differentially expressed proteins ranged from pi  <dig>  to pi  <dig> , with an apparent molecular weight ranging from  <dig> da to  <dig> da. in high phenols samples, isoelectric point of differentially expressed proteins was comprised between pi  <dig>  and pi  <dig> , with an apparent molecular weight from  <dig> da to  <dig> da .

the experimental values of pi and molecular weight  for every isoelectric spot were calculated with imagemaster 2d platinum system.

although an identity was not assigned to the differentially expressed polypeptides, they have been firstly characterized by assigning a molecular mass and a total charge.

CONCLUSIONS
it has been suggested that phenols content is an indicative trait of environmental stress in posidonia oceanica  <cit> . in this work we choose the rhizome basal section as the most reliable material to measure this putative marker of ecosystem imbalance. the posidonia shoots utilized in this study showed that variations in the phenols content exists within the examined meadow , probably reflecting environmental pressures heterogeneity. moreover, comparison of phenols content in the same meadow at one year time distance showed an increase in the overall values.

we have constructed the first 2-d electrophoretic map of posidonia oceanica rhizome, made of  <dig> protein spots, characterized by pi and molecular weight.

usually, the bi-dimensional protein pattern is typical of the physiological state and varies under different environmental conditions. thus, the patterns comparison allows the highlighting of protein expression differences in response to stresses. here we showed, by comparison of samples belonging to sites with low or high phenols content, that certain protein spots present in "low phenols" are absent in "high phenols" and vice versa. this may account for changes in metabolic/physiological pathways as adaptation to stress, including activation/repression of coordinate sets of genes. differences cover the 5–6% of the entire protein map and match the plants phenols response. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to correlate the pattern of expressed proteins to a putative stress indicator, such as phenols content, in posidonia rhizome.

although the identification of each protein spot needs further investigation and might be hampered by the lack of extensive database information, the combined approach, based on phenols content determination and 2-d electrophoresis protein pattern, seems a promising tool to monitor posidonia meadows health state.
