BACKGROUND
self-incompatibility  is genetically controlled, and promotes outcrossing while preventing inbreeding depression in flowering plants  <cit> . although si has emerged as a model for cell-cell communication and signal transduction  <cit> , it is also an agriculturally important trait  <cit> . although si has been widely demonstrated in angiosperms, its mechanism has been elucidated in only a few plants  <cit> . sporophytic si  in brassicaceae is controlled by the stigma-specific s-receptor kinase  and pollen-specific s-locus cysteine-rich protein , which inhibits germination and growth of self-pollen on the stigma  <cit> . while during gametophytic si  in rosaceae, solanaceae and plantaginaceae, the interaction between the female determinant s-rnase and the male component s-locus f-box protein  mediate the rejection response of self-pollen tubes in the pistil . another gsi mechanism exists in papaveraceae in which a ca2+ signaling cascade leads to programmed cell death   <cit> . additionally, many species demonstrate si from pollen inhibition in the ovary, which is called either ovarian si  or late-acting si . this form of si was defined according to the location of the pollen inhibition instead of the genetic mechanism of si as with gsi and ssi  <cit> . lsi is more widespread among the basal groups of angiosperms, which indicates a conserved ancestral mechanism of si; nevertheless, its molecular basis still remains unclear  <cit> . some types of lsi may be controlled by either the gametophyte or sporophyte independently, whereas other types may be jointly controlled  <cit> .

overall, si is regulated by multiple genes and associated with different metabolic pathways. next generation sequencing  and transcriptome analysis has revealed candidate genes that contribute to si interaction in citrus clementine  <cit> , citrus limon  <cit>  and leymus chinensis  <cit> .

the theaceae family consists of  <dig> genera and over  <dig> species  <cit> . several of the species in these subclasses have significant economic value, such as tea , tea-oil tree  and the ornamental sasanqua . due to their self-incompatibility, theaceae species are highly heterogeneous, making crop improvement via classical breeding and genetics difficult  <cit> , it and has hindered genetic map construction and contig assembly from whole-genome sequencing . therefore, uncovering the molecular basis of si in theaceae may simplify and enhance breeding and genomics in this family.

tea is one of the most prominent beverages in the world  <cit>  and is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions  <cit> . it is also a model for studying si  <cit> . tea has exhibited gsi because of a self-pollen tube growth inhibiting at the base of the style  <cit> . however, more recent evidence suggests lsi because the pollen tubes from self-fertilized flowers were inhibited in the ovary  <cit> . similarly, the edible oil plant of c. oleifera also manifests lsi behavior  <cit> . in these studies, although pollen tubes from self-pollinations penetrated the ovary, pollen tube growth was inhibited to some extent in the style. in contrast, pollen tubes from cross-pollination reached the ovary with no interference . therefore, the differential growth of the pollen tube from self and cross-pollinations was a critical trait in understanding si in c. sinensis.

attempts have been made to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying tea si  <cit> . a pistil-specific pathogenesis-related- <dig>  protein was identified in tea, but the relationship between pr- <dig> and si was not clearly demonstrated  <cit> . cdna-aflp method was also used to analyze differentially expressed genes in self-incompatible lines of tea, and  <dig> genes were isolated which were involved in energy metabolism, signal transduction and defense  <cit> . a c. sinensis floral transcriptome analysis revealed the presence of several pollen/pistil specific expression unigenes  <cit> . the objective of this study was to gain deeper insights into the molecular basis of si and to provide a global view of candidate si-related genes in tea using rna-seq. we believe that the identification of candidate si-related genes will contribute to a more complete understanding of the si mechanism in c. sinensis, which will improve breeding and genomics research in the theaceae.

RESULTS
observation of pollen tube growth
pollens from both the cross- and self-pollination germinated at 6 h post-pollination, and no visible differences were observed in pollen tube growth from 6 h to 12 h. at 24 h after pollination, a small number of tubes from the cross-pollination reached the style base . however, pollen tubes from self-pollination grew more slowly, reaching just the middle of the style. at 48 h after pollination, most tubes from cross-pollination reached the style base, but the pollen tubes from the self-pollination took 72 h to reach the same place. self-pollen tubes grew slower than cross-pollen tubes from 24 h to 72 h after pollination. this is consistent with previous studies that also showed reduced pollen tube growth from a si cross . the delay in pollen tube growth may be critical for the si reaction because, by the time that the self-pollen tubes penetrate the ovary, the pistil may have already been primed for abscission  <cit> .fig.  <dig> pollen tubes growth after cp and sp in c. sinensis. cp24: a few pollen tubes reached the style base; cp <dig> and cp72: a larger number of pollen tubes arrived the style base; sp24: pollen tubes in the middle of the style; sp48: a few pollen tubes reached the style base; sp72: a large number of pollen tubes arrived the style base. bar = 500 μm



rna-seq and transcriptome assembly
to uncover the mechanism behind si reaction in c. sinensis, six rna-seq libraries  were separately constructed and sequenced. in total,  <dig>  million raw reads with a q <dig> over 83 % were generated. after removing the low quality sequences , a total of  <dig>  million clean reads were retained . after de novo assembly using trinity software,  <dig>  unigenes were identified. the lengths of unigenes ranged from 301 bp to  <dig>  bp, with an average of  <dig> .26 bp and a n <dig> length of  <dig>  bp .table  <dig> summary for the rna-seq outcomes of six separately pooled samples

functional annotation
to predict potential functions of the assembled unigenes, all of them were blastx  against  <dig> public databases, including the national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant protein , clusters of orthologous groups for eukaryotic complete genomes , kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes , swiss-prot protein database  and gene ontology  . most unigenes  were annotated to the nr database, and  <dig>   sequences had significant homology . among the annotated unigenes, 37 %  and  <dig>  %  had strong homology to vitis vinifera and theobroma cacao, respectively .fig.  <dig> blastx results of the transcriptome to five databases



the unigenes were further annotated and classified using the kog database . a total of  <dig>  unigenes were assigned kog classifications. among the  <dig> kog categories, the “general function prediction only”  was the most abundant, followed by “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones” , “signal transduction mechanisms”  and “translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis” .fig.  <dig> kog functional classification of the c. sinensis transcriptome



the unigenes were then matched to the go terms . a total of  <dig>  unigenes were classified into  <dig> sub-categories belonging to  <dig> categories . among the biological process category, “metabolic process” and “cellular process” were the main functional groups, which were followed by “single organism process” and “response to stimulus”. in terms of cellular component, “cell part” and “cell” were the most highly represented subcategories. for the molecular function category, “binding” and “catalytic activity” were the two main groups.

to predict putative functions of the unigenes, kegg annotation was also performed. altogether,  <dig> unigenes were assigned to  <dig> pathways, including “plant hormone signal transduction”, “calcium signaling pathway”, “plant-pathogen interaction”, “flavonoid biosynthesis” and “ubiquitin mediated proteolysis”. plant hormones play an important role in incompatibility response; for example, in theobroma cacao, auxin exhibited a strong increase after compatibility pollination, while ethylene exhibited a strong increase after incompatibility pollination  <cit> , and higher 1-naphthaleneacetic acid  concentrations improved flower retention after incompatibility pollination  <cit> . plant hormone signal transduction-related pathways were enriched in tomatoes when comparing the unpollinated and pollinated styles of self-compatible and self-incompatible species  <cit> . calcium is essential to pollen tube germination and growth, and its temporal and spatial changes in cytosol generate ca2+ signals  <cit> . ca2+ signaling cascade leads to pcd, which mediates si reaction in papaveraceae  <cit> . rna-seq has also revealed that the calcium-signaling pathway is associated with si in citrus  <cit>  and leymus chinensis  <cit> . si systems presumably have evolved from pathogen defense mechanisms because similar biochemical and molecular processes occur in epidermal cells when fungal invasion occurs and during incompatible pollen tube penetration  <cit> . a large number of defense-related genes were speculated to be involved in incompatible pollen tube rejection  <cit> . ubiquitin mediated proteolysis pathway has a pivotal role in s-rnase-based gsi system. the skp-1-cullin1-f-box-rbx <dig> complex  causes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of non-self s-rnase  <cit> .

differentially expressed genes involve in si
to identify differentially expressed genes associated with si in tea, the expression levels of unigenes were measured based on the fragments per kb per million of the mapped reads  value. totals of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes were obtained between groups of cp <dig> vs. sp <dig>  cp <dig> vs. sp <dig> and cp <dig> vs. sp <dig>  respectively . to determine the putative functions of these genes, go and kegg analyses were implemented. between the group comparing cp <dig> vs. sp <dig>   <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated. among these differentially expressed genes,  <dig> were associated with go categories, and  <dig> were mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways. similarly, between the group of cp <dig> vs. sp <dig>   <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated;  <dig> of them were associated with go categories, and  <dig> were mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways. in addition, between the group of cp <dig> vs. sp <dig>   <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated;  <dig> of them were associated with go categories, and  <dig> were mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways. the high number of differentially expressed unigenes provided an abundant list of candidate si-related genes. in contrast, cdna-aflp analysis of self-incompatible lines of tea previously yielded only  <dig> polymorphic bands  <cit> . therefore, rna-seq seems to be more productive than cdna-aflp for identifying potential si related genes.fig.  <dig> number of differentially expressed unigenes between each two sample combination



in the above comparisons, some pathways occurred in all three comparisons, such as “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”, “phenylalanine metabolism” and “plant-pathogen interaction”. in addition, “ubiquitin mediated proteolysis” , “apoptosis”  <cit> , “calcium signaling pathway”  <cit>  and several defense-related pathways  <cit>  were also identified as up-regulated pathways that are associated with the si reaction in plants. therefore, the unigenes associated with the above pathways may also be associated with si interaction in tea.

for “ubiquitin mediated proteolysis”, a scf complex plays a key role in the s-rnase-based gsi system  <cit> . s-phase kinase-associated protein  <dig> , f-box, ring-box protein  <dig>  and cullin- <dig>  also function as components of the scf complex  <cit> . the scf complex uniquely mediates the ubiquitination of non-self s-rnase, which is then degraded by the 26 s proteasome  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes annotated as skp- <dig> , f-box , rbx <dig>  and cul <dig>  were identified. these unigenes might be directly related to si in tea, which warrant further exploration.

calcium  is a second messenger, which plays a key role in pollen germination and tube growth and serves an important function in the prevention of self-fertilization  <cit> . several ca2+ signaling-related genes were identified that may function during si. calcium-dependent protein kinase  is a ca2+ response element, which localized at the tip of the pollen tube. in petunia, overexpression the pi cdpk <dig> and the pi cdpk <dig> will disrupt growth polarity or inhibit extension of the pollen tube, respectively  <cit> . five predicted cdpks  were detected; the latter three have higher expression levels in sp samples than cp, which might affect the growth polarity or inhibit the extension of the pollen tubes from self-pollination. the protein families of calmodulin , calmodulin-like , and calcineurin b-like  act as sensors during ca2+ signal transduction. several members of them are expressed pollen-specifically and highly expressed during pollen tube germination and elongation  <cit> . here, three cams , four cbls , and three cmls  were identified to be differentially expressed. therefore, the unigenes annotated as cdpks, cams and cmls merit special attention.

gene temporal expression patterns of cp and sp
to identify the temporal expression patterns of genes following self-pollination and cross-pollination treatments , the short time-series expression miner software  was employed. the unigenes in cp and sp groups were clustered into  <dig> profiles . each profile represents a group of genes that exhibited similar expression trend. the highest number of genes in group cp was found in profile  <dig> , followed by profile  <dig> , profile  <dig>  and finally profile  <dig> . while in group sp, profile  <dig>  was also the largest category, followed by profile  <dig> , profile  <dig>  and profile  <dig> .fig.  <dig> different gene expression patterns between cp and sp. each square represents a pattern. top number indicates the profile id number, bottom number indicates the number of time series genes. the patterns were ordered based on the number of genes. the colored squares were significant modules. the horizontal axis represents different times after pollination



following go-term analysis to identify the putative functions of genes in profile  <dig> of both treatments, genes were classified into  <dig> categories including biological process, cellular component and molecular function . for the biological process category, “oxidation-reduction process” was the most abundant subcategory in group cp, while  <dig> genes were classified into “defense response to fungus” , “recognition of pollen”  and “salicylic acid biosynthetic process”  categories. in group sp, “carbohydrate metabolic process” and “response to ethylene” were the dominant groups, while  <dig> genes were involved in “ethylene-activated signaling pathway”  and “cell wall macromolecule catabolic process”  subcategories. these results show that cross- and self-pollination result in different gene expression responses in the style.fig.  <dig> go functional classification of the genes in profile  <dig>  the letters c, f and p represent “cellular component”, “molecular function”, and “biological process”, respectively



a total of  <dig> unigenes were clustered into the “oxidation-reduction process” group, and a heat map was constructed based on the fpkm values of six samples . expression of these unigenes steadily increased from 24 h to 72 h in cross-pollinated styles. a similar trend was observed in self-pollinated styles but with a delay. previous studies have revealed that reactive oxygen species  regulate stress resistance and pollen tube growth in plants  <cit> . ros concentrations increase in incompatible pollen tubes, leading to deleterious effects and si-mediated pcd  <cit> . various antioxidant systems take part in biological processes to maintain the proper concentration of ros and prevent the damage from ros  <cit> . here,  <dig> peroxidases ,  <dig> polyphenol oxidase  and several other redox-related genes were greatly increased in cross-pollinated styles, which is consistent with a previous study showing higher activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in cross-pollinated styles than self-pollinated ones of c. sinensis  <cit> . among the  <dig> putative peroxidase genes,  <dig> unigenes  contained intact orfs and were homologues to at5g <dig>  a multiple sequence alignment of at5g <dig> and the deduced amino acid sequences of cl799contig <dig>  cl39261contig <dig> and cl31720contig <dig> were constructed, which share approximately 70 %, 45 % and 41 % identity, respectively . the gene at5g <dig> encodes a peroxidase  enzyme, which is closely related to the cell wall synthesis  <cit> . therefore, the higher expression levels of these genes might promote pollen tube elongation during compatible styles.fig.  <dig> a heat map of  <dig> oxidation-reduction process-related unigenes generated using a mev software. along the horizontal axis : cp <dig>  cp <dig>  cp <dig>  sp <dig>  sp <dig>  sp <dig>  the vertical axis represent the unigenes

furthermore,  <dig> unigenes  associated with “salicylic acid biosynthetic process” were also consistently up-regulated in  <dig> samples of cp. salicylic acid  may contribute to regulating ros accumulation  <cit> , and then induce the defense responses and impact the self/non-self recognition as well as the pollen tube growth  <cit> .

differentially expressed gene validation by qrt-pcr
fifteen differentially expressed genes were selected to test the reliability of rna-seq data . these genes were associated with “plant-pathogen interaction” , “flavonoid biosynthesis” , “ubiquitin mediated proteolysis” , “apoptosis” , “calcium signaling pathway” , “plant hormone response”  and “negative regulation of programmed cell death” . the expression patterns for  <dig> genes  were highly consistent with the sequencing data, while  <dig> genes  were partially consistent . the qrt-pcr results confirmed that the rna-seq results were relatively accurate.table  <dig> primers used for qrt-pcr validation

analysis of a putative s-rnase gene
s-rnase is associated with gsi in plants of rosaceae, solanaceae and plantaginaceae  <cit> . pistil-expressed s-rnase acts as a type of cytotoxin for self-pollen rejection  <cit> . it was first cloned from nicotiana alata  <cit> , then transgenic analyses in petunia inflate prove that the s-rnase is the pistil determinant during the pollen rejection interaction  <cit> . recently, s-rnase has been identified in various species, such as solanaceae  <cit> , prunus  <cit> , malus  <cit> , pyrus  <cit> , antirrhinum  <cit> , and citrus  <cit> .

a putative s-rnase gene , which had strong homology to ribonuclease t <dig> gene, was obtained. a phylogenetic tree, based on the amino acid sequence of cl25983contig <dig> and s-rnases from other species , revealed  <dig> main groups. s-rnases from malus and pyrus were clustered in group i. the sequence from coffea canephora was in group ii. cl25983contig <dig> and other s-rnases from petunia, solanum, nicotiana, medicago, antirrhinum and citrus were clustered in group iii. all of the sequences from prunus were clustered together in group iv. cl25983contig <dig> was most closely related to s-rnases from citrus reticulata, antirrhinum hispanicum and medicago truncatulata.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of the putative s-rnase  from c. sinensis and s-rnases from other species using neighbor-joining method. blue highlighting indicates the position of cl25983contig <dig>  yellow highlighting indicates the position of  <dig> genes, which have the highest similarity to cl25983contig1



qrt-pcr of cl25983contig <dig> in different tissues of tea  confirmed that this gene was expressed at much higher levels in styles than other tissues such as filaments, leaves, petals and pollens. moreover, the expression level of cl25983contig <dig> increased at 24 h after self-pollination and was  <dig>  times higher than that of cross-pollination . interestingly, the pollen tube growth in sp was hindered at 24 h. this suggests that cl25983contig <dig> plays an important role in the si reaction.fig.  <dig> the expression pattern of the putative s-rnase gene  in different tissues in c. sinensis

recently, lsi has been demonstrated in many different species; however, the molecular mechanism for lsi is not well understood  <cit> . lsi is defined based on the location of self-pollen inhibition rather than the molecular mechanism  <cit> . lsi can be regulated in different ways, through gametophytic or sporophytic control, either independently or acting together  <cit> . for the pollen tube growth from a self-pollination that was arrested in the ovary, self-incompatibility in c. sinensis was assumed to occur via lsi  <cit> . because growth of pollen tubes from self-pollination was halted in the style to a certain extent, and several scf components-encoding genes and a putative s-rnase were identified, lsi in tea is likely under gametophytic control.

CONCLUSIONS
transcriptome analysis of styles after cross- and self-pollination in tea has identified a set of candidate genes involved in self-incompatibility. high levels of expression of several scf components-encoding genes and a putative s-rnase gene suggest that lsi in c. sinensis might be under gametophytic control. our study offers novel insights into the molecular mechanism behind si in c. sinensis. we believe that this rna-seq data will be useful for breeding and genomics research in c. sinensis as well as other plants in the theaceae family.
