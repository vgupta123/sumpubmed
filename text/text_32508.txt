BACKGROUND
dengue  is distributed worldwide in tropical and subtropical countries including mexico and the usa and is the most common vector-borne viral disease in humans. infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild self-limited illness  to a severe disease with spontaneous hemorrhaging , or, most seriously, to den shock syndrome  characterized by circulatory failure. fifty million den infections with  <dig>  cases of dhf and  <dig>  deaths occur each year  <cit> . in the years  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig>  cases of den and  <dig>  of dhf were reported in mexico  <cit> .

the dengue virus  infects mammalian  <cit>  and vector cells. neutralizing antibodies facilitate the binding and penetration of denv into human macrophages; the virus-antibody complex binds fc receptors  <cit> . this mechanism does not explain virus entry in primary infections or in cells with non-fc receptors. transmission electron microscopy shows that den viruses must attach to the cells  <cit> , suggesting that the cells must have virus receptor on their surfaces to be susceptible to infection. proteins  <cit> , heparan sulfates  <cit> , lps/cd14-associated binding proteins  <cit>  and other glycoproteins  <cit>  have been proposed as cellular receptors for denv. in addition, dc-sign  <cit>  has been suggested as a mediator of denv infection in dendritic cells and could participate in binding large numbers of other viruses such as hiv- <dig>  ebola and cytomv to host cell surfaces  <cit> .

in c6/ <dig> cells, two major polypeptides have been described with apparent molecular weights of  <dig> and  <dig> kda, which bind to den virus serotype  <dig>   <cit> . the mechanism by which the virus enters mosquito cells is unknown. the presence of receptor on the surface does not necessarily render a cell susceptible to infection. in natural infection, denv is first deposited in the mosquito vector and then in a human host bitten by the vector during a blood meal. therefore, it is necessary to study receptors in the mosquito midgut  to determine which binding proteins serve as true virus receptors; they may be relevant to treating den infection and in designing control strategies. this is especially important because mosquitoes differ in their susceptibilities to infection, resulting in different vector competences  <cit> .

the present study shows that the proteins r <dig> and r <dig> are the putative receptors in the mg of ae. aegypti. moreover, proteins with the same apparent molecular weights were purified by denv <dig> affinity chromatography from the mg of this mosquito and from c6/ <dig> cells. in addition, a protein with molecular weight of  <dig> kda was also purified from mosquito mg extracts by affinity chromatography. immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled membranes using ae. aegypti anti-mg antibodies showed that r <dig> and r <dig> are contained in mosquito cell membranes. furthermore, the four serotypes of denv recognized the same proteins on ae. aegypti and c6/ <dig> cells.

RESULTS
identification and purification of the putative denv <dig> receptors in ae. aegypti midgut by the virus overlay protein binding assay
mosquito mg proteins were extracted with  <dig> % of triton x- <dig>  separated by sds-page, blotted on to a pvdf membrane and incubated with biotinylated denv <dig> virus to identify the putative receptors. two prominent polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of  <dig> and  <dig> kda were observed . the negative control without virus showed no bands .

to purify the putative receptors, denv <dig> affinity chromatography was performed by passing cell membrane proteins from c6/ <dig> cells from ae. albopictus  or mg proteins from ae. aegypti through a denv2-sepharoseâ„¢ 4b column. representative patterns  of c6/ <dig> cell membrane or midgut proteins retained and eluted by the column  are shown in figure  <dig> panel a, lane  <dig>  and figure  <dig> panel b, respectively. two major proteins with molecular masses of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda were observed. figure 1a lane  <dig> shows the total protein pattern of c6/ <dig> cells. mg proteins eluted from the column showed an additional band with apparent molecular weight of  <dig> kda . fraction  <dig> showed the  <dig> kda protein .

immunoprecipitation of the putative receptors from c6/ <dig> cell apical surfaces
to confirm that the putative receptors in ae. aegypti mg epithelial cells are similar to those in ae. albopictus c6/ <dig> cells, the apical surfaces of c6/ <dig> cells were labeled with 125i and precipitated with anti-c6/ <dig> cell membrane and anti-mg antibodies. antibody specificity was tested by immunoblotting . proteins with apparent molecular weights over  <dig> kda were recognized. the negative control with pre-immune serum showed no bands .

labeled proteins from the apical surfaces of c6/ <dig> cells  precipitated by polyclonal antibodies against ae. aegypti mg  or c6/ <dig> cell membranes  were separated by 10% sds-page. the immunoprecipitated labeled proteins had molecular masses of  <dig> and  <dig> kda. the labeled proteins were not precipitated by an unrelated antibody, anti-actin .

apical cell surface proteins bound the four serotypes of den virus
to determine whether different serotypes of denv recognized the same receptors, labeled apical cell surface proteins from c6/ <dig> cells were incubated with denv <dig>  denv <dig>  denv <dig> or denv <dig>  and precipitated by incubation with antibodies against each denv serotype. all four serotypes led to the immunoprecipitation of proteins with molecular masses of  <dig> and  <dig> kda . labeled c6/ <dig> apical membrane proteins were precipitated by anti-ep antibodies as a positive control . the control without den virus showed no polypeptides .

polyclonal antibody-mediated blocking of denv <dig> binding and infection of c6/ <dig> cells
the specificities of anti-ep, anti-r <dig> and anti-r <dig> prepared to test inhibition of den virus binding and infection were assessed by immunoblotting  and immunofluorescence  as described in the methods section. anti-ep recognized two polypeptides with molecular masses of  <dig> and  <dig> kda  and anti-r <dig> and anti-r <dig> recognized polypeptides of  <dig>  and  <dig> kda , respectively. pre-immune mouse serum recognized no polypeptides .

there was no immunofluorescence staining when c6/ <dig> cells were incubated with pre-immune serum . in contrast, anti-membrane, anti-mg, anti-ep, anti-r <dig> and anti-r <dig> antibodies all stained the c6/ <dig> membranes . anti-r <dig> also stained the cytoplasm .

in order to test antibody blocking of denv binding, c6/ <dig> cell monolayers were incubated with anti-ep, anti-r <dig>  anti-r <dig> or anti-mg antibodies or pre-immune serum, then with 125i- den <dig> virus as described in the methods section . anti-ep, anti-r <dig> and anti-r <dig> decreased virus binding by up to 40%. binding was inhibited by 70% when anti-mg was diluted 1: <dig> .

to test the inhibition of denv <dig> infection by the specific anti-receptor antibodies, c6/ <dig> cell monolayers were incubated separately for  <dig> h in media containing pre-immune serum, anti-ep, anti-r <dig> or anti-r <dig> diluted 1: <dig> or 1: <dig>  before being infected with denv <dig>  infection was allowed to proceed for  <dig> days and the amount of infectious virus was determined by viral plaque assays in llc-mk <dig> cells . maximal inhibition of infection was obtained with anti-ep and anti-r <dig> diluted 1: <dig> . these antibodies inhibited den  <dig> replication in the c6/ <dig> cells nearly 1000-fold. anti-r <dig> showed a relatively minor inhibitory effect of approximately 100-fold. anti-ep, anti-r <dig> or anti-r <dig> diluted 1: <dig>  and pre-immune serum, did not inhibit den <dig> replication in these cells.

discussion
when a mosquito takes a viremic blood meal, virions interact with receptors on the midgut epithelial cells and penetrate and infect them. arbovirus blocked at early stages of midgut infection is considered a midgut infection barrier . a midgut escape barrier  is considered when infectious virions do not disseminate to hemoceles, or disseminate but do not infect secondary target organs.

most studies of flavivirus vector competence in ae. aegypti indicate that mib is a major determinant of transmission  <cit>  and shows wide variation both among and within ae. aegypti populations for flaviviruses including denv  <cit> . moreover, ae. aegypti mg is generally considered the best candidate tissue for disrupting the virus life cycle within the mosquito because it is the earliest interface between insect and virus . this strongly suggests that denv attachment to mg epithelial cell receptors is critical for understanding the initial virus-vector interactions and will help to explain mibs to denv infection and variations in vector competence. furthermore, we would expect that virus serotype and genotype would influence virus attachment to midgut receptors.

thus, identification of viral receptors in the mg represents a critical step in understanding vector competence and designing possible targets for preventing viral entry to cells and therefore inhibiting the infection. feasible approaches to intervention are monoclonal antibodies blocking the receptor, and synthetic peptides mimicking the viral receptor and thus competing with the host receptor for virus attachment. this will allow novel strategies for the control and prevention of den to be developed. published data have shown that the viral e protein is involved in target cell recognition  <cit> . recent structural and genetic evidence  <cit>  suggests that the prm/m stem-anchor region is also likely to play a role in virion entry to cells. purification by denv  <dig> affinity chromatography using native virus is a novel approach to obtaining the putative protein receptors for denv.

several authors using the overlay assay have identified polypeptides with molecular masses of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in macrophages  <cit> ,  <dig> and  <dig> in myelomonocytes  <cit> ,  <dig> and  <dig> kda in b and t cells from humans  <cit> , and two heparan sulfate containing cell-surface binding proteins resolving at  <dig> and  <dig> kda in hepatocytes  <cit> . the data in the present paper strongly support the view that the  <dig> and  <dig> kda proteins are receptors for denv  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in mg cells from aedes aegypti. furthermore, we have purified these proteins for the first time from both ae. albopictus c6/ <dig> cells and ae. aegypti mgs using denv <dig> affinity chromatography; we also generated specific antibodies against them, which inhibited binding and infection of cultured cells by denv  <dig>  these results contrast with those of yazi-mendoza et al.  <cit> , who showed that denv  <dig> binds to a  <dig> kda protein in mosquito tissues. the results in figure  <dig> clearly demonstrate that denv  <dig> recognizes r <dig> and r <dig> in c6/ <dig> cell membranes. a plausible explanation is that yazi-mendoza et al.  <cit>  used total cell extracts for their vopba, while our results were obtained from plasma membranes, although viruses are known to have several receptors  <cit> . in any event, further experiments are needed to settle the point. interestingly, jindadamrongwech & smith  <cit>  found a serotype-specific heterogeneity among denv binding proteins on hepg <dig> human liver cells. it is therefore possible that different cell lines have different specificities for virus serotypes.

the specific antibodies against r <dig> and r <dig> inhibited radiolabeled den virus binding and the highest inhibition was observed with anti-mg antibodies, suggesting that other cell membrane molecules may participate in virus binding. candidates include non-sialic acid carbohydrates, since we previously showed that sialic acid does not participate in virus binding  <cit> . in agreement with our results, zieler et al.  <cit>  failed to detect sialic acid in ae. aegypti mg. more recently, thaisomboonsuk et al.  <cit>  reported the inability of neuroaminidase to inhibit den- <dig> virus binding to insect cells.

as we mentioned earlier, dc-sign has also been reported as a functional receptor on human dendritic cells  <cit>  for denv and other flaviviruses. further studies are needed to determine the involvement of dc-sign as receptor in denv infection in ae. aegypti mosquitoes.

collectively, the results corroborate the notion that denv utilizes multiple cell surface molecules for binding to and infection of target cells, some of which may be common to all cells and shared among several viruses  <cit> . interestingly, sakoonwtanyoo et al.  <cit>  suggested that one of these protein receptors for denv  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> may be a laminin-binding protein with an apparent mass of  <dig> kda. although we failed to detect a protein with this molecular mass, this does not eliminate the possibility.

in summary, specific membrane molecules are required for denv binding and the nature of these molecules seems to depend on cell type. interestingly, our results show that r <dig> and r <dig> are the putative receptors in the mg of ae. aegypti mosquitoes, the principal denv vector in america, and in ae. albopictus c6/ <dig> cells. in addition, these receptors are specific for all four serotypes of denv.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper documents for the first time that the proteins r <dig> and r <dig> are putative receptors for dengue virus in the midgut of ae. aegypti and in ae. albopictus c6/ <dig> cells, since specific antibodies against these proteins inhibited the binding and cytopathic effects of the virus. furthermore, we have shown that these receptors are specific for all four serotypes of denv.
