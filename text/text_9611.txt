BACKGROUND
rice is an important cereal crop that has the potential to provide food security to the increasing world population. out of the total global agricultural land,  <dig> million hectares is estimated to be under rice cultivation that leads to an annual production averaging to  <dig> million metric tons  <cit> . but a large amount of the rice biomass is not harvested under field conditions due to sensitivity of the crop to various abiotic stresses like drought, salinity, low temperature, heat shock  <cit> . among these stresses, salinity is a major constrain to rice production worldwide which adversely affect its growth and development at the molecular, biochemical and physiological level  <cit> . it affects more than 20 % of total cultivated land worldwide that results in us$ <dig> billion loss in global agricultural production and this loss is further increasing each year  <cit> . as in the present scenario of global climate change, the level of land salinization is expected to increase and hence there is an immediate world-wide concern for development of better salt tolerant cultivars for future food security. for achieving this objective, a thorough comparative analysis of salt sensitive and tolerant cultivars coupled with increased understanding of the underlying mechanism involved in salt stress adaptation is much warranted.

reactive oxygen species  generation, signalling and detoxification are vital components of salt stress adaptation mechanisms and a priority area of research worldwide for the accomplishment of better growth and yield of a crop under salt affected areas  <cit> . ros such as superoxide radical , hydroxyl radical  and hydrogen peroxide  are produced in a low concentration as a result of normal cellular metabolism in plants and plays important role in growth, development and in adaptation to stress  <cit> . but, when a plant is subjected to stress, the perturbation of ros homeostasis takes place which triggers multiple signalling responses involved in critical functions of plants  <cit> . hence, a fine tuned balance between ros production and scavenging is crucial for the plant survival under unfavourable conditions.

nadph oxidases are one of the major enzyme systems involved in production of ros in the apoplastic space under stress  <cit> . they catalyze the transfer of electons from nadph to molecular oxygen  for the generation of free radical o2-  <cit> . nadph oxidases hold a distinct position among the various ros generating enzyme systems in plants because of their role in different signalling pathways involved in plant growth, development and stress tolerance  <cit> . superoxide ions produced as a result of enzymatic activity of nadph oxidase is converted into h2o <dig> via superoxide dismutase  and it diffuses to adjacent cellular components where it acts as a signalling molecule that activates various stress responsive pathways. this indicates that the coordination of ros generating and scavenging system might play a critical role in salt stress adaptation mechanism. however, the exact role of nadph oxidase in conferring salt stress adaptation is not yet properly understood.

earlier studies conducted on salt tolerant cultivar pokali and sensitive cultivar ir <dig> under the effect of salt treatment has indicated a definitive link between scavenging system and salinity tolerance  <cit> . however, to best of our knowledge no work has been initiated to compare the ros generating and scavenging system together in salt sensitive and tolerant cultivars. therefore, in the present study, a comparative study of ros dynamics was conducted in salt tolerant  and salt sensitive  cultivars of rice. the information gained on real time situation on this critical stress alleviating ros pathway will facilitate in developing cultivars with better salt stress adaptation. further, this work adds to the existing knowledge of our understanding on the complex physiological, biochemical and genetic mechanisms involved in salt stress adaptation.

RESULTS

discussion
in the present study, it was observed that the tolerant cultivars  maintain a higher level of h2o <dig> and lower level of o2- as compared to the sensitive cultivars . h2o <dig> acts as a secondary messenger that activates the various stress adaptive signalling pathways at both genetic and physiological levels  <cit> . it is known to activate various genes involved in the acclimation and tolerance to salt stress  <cit> . further, enhanced h2o <dig> production in halophytes is essential for their “salt stress preparedness”  <cit> . our study indicates that salt tolerant cultivars luna sankhi and luna suvarna are capable of constitutive activation of plant defence pathways due to the higher basal level of h2o <dig> that in turn keeps the tolerant cultivars ready for adaptation to salt stress conditions. hence, h2o <dig> ‘signatures’ may be operating in salt stress signalling pathways in rice that keeps the defence pathway networks activated in tolerant cultivars  <cit> . furthermore, the elevated basal level of h2o <dig> found in the tolerant cultivars could be attributed to the higher activity of nadph oxidase and sod enzyme in luna sankhi and luna suvarna that was further confirmed through the estimation of specific enzymatic activity of sod. these findings suggest that the higher generation of o2- in a nadph dependent manner and its rapid conversion into signalling molecule h2o <dig> could be considered as a critical clue in understanding the model depicting better adaptation of tolerant cultivars towards salinity.

once the signalling cascade has been initiated, plants are defended to the toxic effects of h2o <dig> with the help of apx, cat and other peroxidases in a way similar to the ca2+ efflux system that operates in well-known cytosolic calcium ‘signatures’  <cit> . similarly, in the present work, the specific activity of peroxidases apx and gpx was found to be high in tolerant varieties which could be scavenging the excess of h2o <dig> to prevent the plant from its ill effects, whereas the specific activity of cat was found to be low. the less expression of cat in tolerant cultivars could be due to the common substrate of apx and cat and because of the higher affinity of apx for hydrogen peroxide than cat  <cit> . moreover, apx regulates the role of h2o <dig> as a signalling molecule unlike cat which is more involved in detoxification  <cit> .

till now, the majority of research on the relation between ros and salinity tolerance has been focussed on the enzymatic antioxidants although non-enzymatic antioxidants also play crucial role in scavenging excess of ros and conferring tolerance  <cit> . ascorbate is a known non enzymatic antioxidant that plays a central role in the ascorbate–glutathione cycle  <cit> . apx uses ascorbate as a reductant for the scavenging of h2o <dig> and converts it into dehydroascorbate. but for the maintenance of antioxidative capacity of ascorbate, its rapid regeneration into reduced form is necessary. apx functions in combination with gr, dhar and mdhar in glutathione-ascorbate pathway for the regeneration of ascorbate. in our studies, the specific activities of gr, dhar and mdhar enzymes were also found to be high in tolerant cultivars. further the ratio of reduced to oxidised ascorbate was also observed to be high in luna sankhi and luna suvarna. this could be implied to the better operation of non-enzymatic glutathione-ascorbate pathway in tolerant cultivars which may be one of the many reasons for their superior salt tolerance ability  <cit> . furthermore, the higher activity of various antioxidant enzymes  in a coordinated manner in salt tolerant cultivars suggests that they are the major determinants in the model for depicting salt tolerance.

to further understand the dynamic role of antioxidant enzymes in conferring salt tolerance to halophytic varieties of rice, their transcript level expression study was conducted. among the different isoforms of sod, the expression of fe-sod and cu/zn-sod was found to be high in tolerant cultivars whereas, the expression of mn-sod was more in sensitive cultivars. in an earlier study from our laboratory, we observed a higher expression of fe-sod and cu/zn-sod in response to salt treatment in pusa basmati- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the higher basal expression level of fe-sod and cu/zn-sod in tolerant cultivars could be one of the many reasons for their better adaptation in salt stress.

furthermore, to get a better insight into the mechanism conferring elevated adaptation to salinity stress in luna sankhi and luna suvarna, some of the biochemical stress markers were studied. in the present study, enhanced level of total protein in luna sankhi and luna suvarna was observed which could be attributed to the synthesis of new or elevated level of proteins linked to stress tolerance in these cultivars. this result is further strengthened by the report that enhanced synthesis level of proteins is one of the major determinants of stress adaptation in halophytes  <cit> . proline is a known osmoprotectant that also plays multiple antioxidant roles. hyperaccumulation of free proline in plants is known in conferring salinity tolerance  <cit> . the higher accumulation of free proline in luna sankhi and luna suvarna may be playing an important role in quenching of excess of ros and stabilization of ros-scavenging enzymes along with its well known role in osmoticum maintainence  <cit> . further, with regard to reduced mda content in tolerant cultivars, our results are in agreement to the previous studies where it has been shown that higher antioxidant enzyme activities are responsible for low mda content which in turn inhibits the membrane damage by ros and hence confers tolerance  <cit> . it was interesting to note that the content of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll was less in the tolerant cultivars in comparison to sensitive cultivars. under salt stress conditions, plants are often observed to have reduced chlorophyll content  <cit> . however, analysis of chlorophyll content in salt tolerant and sensitive cultivars will provide the physiological explanation to adaptation of plant to salinity stress and hence it is a subject of worth investigation. in our investigation the less chlorophyll contents in tolerant cultivars may be either due to the ros mediated degradation of cholorophyll or it could be photocatalytic activity of cholorophyll itself for the production of h2o <dig>  <cit> . in our case, we presume that in tolerant cultivars the salt tolerance could be attributed to the enhanced production of h2o <dig>  which may be due to the photocatalytic activity of chlorophyll  <cit> . moreover, the role of light in chlorophyll degradation has also been suggested  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the tolerant cultivars of rice maintain a high threshold level of h2o <dig> due to more enzymatic activity of nadph oxidase and enough sod “in stock” that may constitutively activates the defence pathways resulting in higher intrinsic activity of various antioxidant enzymes. this provides certain adaptive advantage to halophytes over glycophytes because of which salt stress does not lead to oxidative stress in tolerant cultivars. further, the first time comparative analysis of ros generating system nadph oxidase in halophytes and glycophytes provide a critical clue on understanding the model depicting salt tolerance in rice. we propose that these two systems work together in synchronization with each other for achieving salt tolerance. it will be interesting to further explore the crosstalk that exists between ros generating and scavenging system for achieving salinity tolerance and whether this crosstalk operates in feedforward or feedback manner. furthermore, the observation of degradation of chlorophyll for producing higher level of h2o <dig> and in turn offering tolerance points out towards an uncharted mechanism in salt stress adaptation biology.
