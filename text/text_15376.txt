BACKGROUND
physical maps built from large-insert bac clones and anchored to linkage maps assist sequence assembly in whole genome shotgun  sequencing projects  <cit> , enable positional cloning of genes/qtls and structural studies on gene families  <cit> , and facilitate the isolation of homologous genes from model plants in heterozygous or polyploid species  <cit> .

in plants, physical maps have been constructed for arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , apple  <cit> , black cottonwood  <cit> , and grapevine  <cit> . strategies based on bac fingerprints detect overlaps among bac clones for the development of physical maps. briefly, bac clones are digested with restriction enzymes and the fragments are separated by electrophoresis, producing a pattern of bands. the overlap between adjacent clones is identified by pairwise comparison of band profiles and calculation of the proportion of shared bands  <cit> . technologies for producing bac fingerprints have evolved rapidly, from using one to five restriction enzymes, and moving from agarose-based gel to sequencer-based electrophoresis to generate the profiles  <cit> . the methods that combine the use of several restriction enzymes and acrylamide gels or sequencers are usually referred to as high information content fingerprinting , because they have allowed a dramatic increase in the sensitivity of the process. since all of these methodologies were not applied to the same biological materials, the performances are not homogeneously comparable, and the debate on the advantages and disadvantages of the different protocols still persists  <cit> . for instance, it appears that the five-enzyme restriction protocol developed by  <cit>  leads to a higher error rate per fingerprint, but provides the highest sensitivity compared with alternative techniques based on two or three-enzyme restrictions  <cit> . in the present work, the five-enzyme restriction protocol was adopted because of its higher sensitivity and throughput.

the grapevine genome has recently disclosed two peculiarities: grapes are highly heterozygous and they have descended from an ancient hexaploid ancestor  <cit> . the polyploid origin of the grapevine genome was revealed by whole proteome comparison  <cit>  but was undetectable using sts markers or nucleotide alignments. thus homeologous regions are not expected to hamper the construction of a physical map of the grapevine genome, as their respective fingerprints are substantially different. in turn, heterozygosity is likely to affect the correct assembly of bac fingerprints, as it did in the dna assembly of ciona savignyi  <cit> . this aspect was addressed in poplar by  <cit> , but was somewhat neglected in grapevine  <cit>  and in apple  <cit> . here, a thorough analysis of the effects of heterozygosity on physical map construction is presented that unveils contig features that were not previously described in poplar. it is also shown that the final map is an effective tool for mapping candidate genes for agronomic traits like disease resistance, as well as for developing new genetic markers.

strengthening the resistance to diseases is one of the major objectives in grapevine breeding  <cit> . two types of defence can be categorized in plants, based on the width of the host range. non-host resistance is effective across an entire plant taxon against all isolates of a pathogen. host resistance, the second type of resistance, is exerted at a genotype-to-genotype level: only some of the genotypes of a plant taxon to which a pathogen has adapted are resistant to any or all pathogenic strains. this classification agrees well with that based on the type of mechanisms and genes involved. pre-invasion barriers and reactions triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns , called pamp-triggered immunity , disrupt the potential ability of a pathogen to attack a plant. overall, the concepts of non-host resistance and pti overlap. host resistance is a second line of defence towards pathogens that have gained the capability of suppressing basal or pamp-triggered resistance. host resistance can be either complete or partial. the mechanisms underlying complete resistance are similar across many types of plants. complete host resistance is conferred by r proteins that recognise pathogen effectors/suppressors or modifications of their cellular targets . r genes are mostly arrayed in clusters, a physical organisation that generates new variants at a rate higher than in any other class of genes  <cit> . the links between eti, pti, complete host, and non-host resistance were modelled by  <cit> . both pti and eti rely first on pathogen recognition carried out by receptors, consisting of transmembrane proteins for pti  <cit> , and cytoplasmic proteins with a nucleotide-binding site and a leucine-rich repeat domain  or receptor-like kinases  for eti  <cit> . these two sides of the immune system are connected by proteins of the downstream signalling pathways, such as sgt <dig> and rar <dig>  <cit> , and by gene products of the salicilic acid , jasmonic acid , ethylene , and mapk cascade pathways  <cit> .

non-host resistance is the outcome of a heterogeneous set of genes, and the proteins they specify, that are implicated in pathogen accessibility/inaccessibility , cytoskeletal rearrangements and protein turnover , pamp-triggered responses, and synthesis of toxic metabolites  <cit> . the location of their homologues in the grapevine genome was recently established using information from the grapevine genome sequence  <cit> , which was unknown when this study began. in contrast, the genes triggering complete host resistance all conform to a few classes of receptor-coding genes that are functionally similar. clues on the size and the genomic organisation of r gene families in grape were given by genetic map data  <cit>  and by a survey in the draft genome sequence  <cit> .

in this paper, we present  the assembly of a 'cabernet sauvignon' physical map based on restriction enzyme bac fingerprinting,  the anchorage of the physical contigs on the meiotic linkage maps,  the use of this map for the placement of candidate genes for disease resistance, and  the alignment between the physical location of resistance gene analogues and phenotypic loci for pathogen resistance based on bridging markers. how the high heterozygosity in the 'cabernet sauvignon' genome has shaped some features of the physical map is also studied in detail and discussed.

RESULTS
construction of the 'cabernet sauvignon' physical map
the  <dig>  bac clones of the 'cabernet sauvignon' bac library, which represent about  <dig>  genome equivalents  <cit> , were fingerprinted using the method described by  <cit> . raw data were trimmed for background signals, vector peaks, chloroplastic clones, intra-plate contaminations, and chimerical clones. a total of  <dig>  high-quality fingerprints  were used to assemble a map, using fpc  <dig>  and following the iterative approach proposed by  <cit> . in the final version of the map  <dig>  clones were ordered in contigs, while  <dig>  clones  remained as singletons . the physical map includes  <dig>  contigs comprised of  <dig>  unique bands spanning  <dig>  kbp in physical length, a size that is  <dig> -fold larger than the actual genome size. the contigs were made up of  <dig>  clones on average and had an average physical size of  <dig> kbp. the assembly included  <dig>   questionable clones , which are clones of uncertain position. these clones were found in  <dig>  questionable contigs.

the average band size  was estimated by dividing the average insert size of the bac clones by the average number of bands per clone used for fingerprinting. this value was used to estimate the physical length of the contigs.

integration of physical and genetic maps and assessment of the quality of the physical map
the alignment between the physical and the linkage maps was initiated using the ssr markers genetically mapped by  <cit> , and preliminarily reported by  <cit> . primer pairs were used for pcr screening of  <dig>  bac clones, corresponding to  <dig> genome equivalents, which identified  <dig>  positive bac clones, corresponding to  <dig> clones per marker on average. out of the  <dig> initial markers,  <dig> were not useful for the integration because they localised on bac clones that did not yield useful fingerprints  or on singleton clones . the remaining  <dig> ssr markers anchored  <dig> contigs covering  <dig>  mbp and corresponding to  <dig> % of the total size of the physical map . out of these  <dig> contigs, a unique genetic position could be assigned to  <dig> contigs that correspond to  <dig> mbp . the location of the other contigs remained ambiguous, because the markers physically localised on a given contig were genetically assigned to more than one linkage group . out of the  <dig> genetically anchored contigs,  <dig>  were anchored by two or more markers and covered  <dig>  mbp, whereas the other  <dig> contigs were anchored by only one marker and covered  <dig>  mbp. the average size of anchored contigs was  <dig>  kbp, whereas the average size of non-anchored contigs was  <dig>  kbp. the map is available at  <cit> .

contigs containing genes relevant to this work and not tagged by the markers of the reference vitis map were anchored by ssr markers positioned in other genetic maps  <cit> , by newly developed ssr markers, and by sscp markers . these markers were projected onto the reference vitis map by map alignment with common markers, and are reported underlined and in italics . they allowed the anchoring of  <dig> additional contigs, expanding the size of the anchored map to  <dig> mbp. this corresponds to  <dig> % of the total map size .

the markers used for integration consisted of  <dig> microsatellites from the reference map of  <cit> ,  <dig> microsatellites present in other genetic maps, newly developed markers from contigs that carried genes relevant to this study, and  <dig> sscp markers for nbs-lrr genes  <cit> . the physical length of the contigs was estimated based on an average band size of  <dig>  kbp.

* not assigned to a linkage group because two or more markers placed on the physical contig mapped to two or more linkage groups.

the quality of the physical map was tested using two types of checks: first, an estimate was obtained for the percentage of chimerical contigs, that is bac clones from different genomic regions spuriously assembled in the same contig, and second, an assay on the reliability of bac clone order within physical contigs was performed.

two independent tests were applied to estimate the percentage of chimerical contigs. the first test examined  <dig> contigs on which two or more genetically mapped markers were localised. in  <dig> contigs , inconsistency was observed between the genetic and physical position of the markers. markers with independent segregation were found physically linked in the same contig. in order to determine whether it originated from erroneous genetic data or from an inherent genomic complexity that mixed up bacs in the contig assembly, these  <dig> contigs were further examined. for each marker, the genomic location and the presence of unique annealing sites for the corresponding primer pair were validated and confirmed using the pn <dig> genome sequence  <cit> . thus, it was concluded that the chimaeras were not caused by marker duplication or misplacing. little evidence was found that it could be due to homeology; only contig  <dig> contained two markers pointing to two homeologous regions of the grapevine genome. for the second test, the bac clones were aligned to the pn <dig> genome sequence through their unique bac end sequences . out of  <dig> contigs made up of at least two bacs that aligned to the sequence,  <dig>  appeared to be potentially chimerical. as this value of chimerism is much lower than the one predicted using molecular markers, the bac alignment to the genome sequence of the  <dig> marker-chimerical contigs was examined in detail. for  <dig> contigs , the inconsistency was due to a single bac clone found to match one molecular marker, and in  <dig> out of these  <dig> cases, the same molecular marker also matched bac clones of other contigs. it is thus likely that in these  <dig> cases, the overall construction of the contig was correct except for a local mis-insertion of a single alien bac. in the other  <dig> cases, the chimaeras predicted by molecular markers were confirmed by the location of the bes on the genome sequence. some automatic steps of the assembling procedure were reconsidered. the bac clones to which the questionable molecular markers belong were not joined to the contig by the merging steps during the iterative assembly  <cit> , but they had mixed up earlier during the automatic assembly and the first dqing steps. indeed,  <dig> out of these  <dig> contigs showed a suspiciously high percentage of q clones  compared with the average value . these  <dig> contigs were rebuilt using a sulston's cutoff score of 1e- <dig>  in only  <dig> out of  <dig> cases  the physical linkage in the chimerical contig could be broken. it can be argued that these types of contigs hide a biological complexity which can not be properly handled using automatic procedures.

the second study to assess the quality of the physical map consisted of a detailed analysis of how bac clones are ordered relative to one another within contigs in two arbitrarily selected genomic regions. the first region was at the top of lg  <dig> between markers vvmd <dig> and udv- <dig>  and was covered by two physical contigs. the second region comprised  <dig> contigs in the interval between the markers vmc9g <dig> and vvib <dig> on lg  <dig>  the ssr markers were re-scored on all the bac clones included in the corresponding region . the bac clones were then aligned to the pn <dig> genome sequence using their bes.

two main problems were observed. the first one was an incorrect order of the bac clones within a contig, producing apparent duplications of loci in the physical map. an example of this effect is shown for the contig  <dig> . the vvmd <dig> genetic marker was physically localised on two separate groups of bac clones as if they belonged to a duplicated region. the vvmd <dig> primer pair aligned to a unique position on the genome assembly and the end sequences of the bac clones that carried vvmd <dig> aligned to the same single genomic region as well , showing that the apparent duplication in the physical contig corresponded to a single locus in the genome sequence. the same pattern of apparent intra-contig duplications could also be seen in a less obvious manner for vvii <dig> and udv- <dig> . the second effect of heterozygosity was the assembly of the bac clones corresponding to the two different haplotypes into separate contigs, which was clearly represented in the lg  <dig>  in this case, no artifactual intra-contig duplication was observed, but two separate contigs containing allelic bac clones of the marker vvib <dig> were identified . the largest one  was made of  <dig> bac clones, while the other one  was made of only  <dig> bac clones and corresponded to the alternate haplotype of the region targeted by vvib <dig> in the contig  <dig>  the unique match of the vvib <dig> primer pair and of the bes of all its bac clones on the pn <dig> genome sequence confirmed that contig  <dig> and contig  <dig> were allelic. both effects led to an inflation of the size of the physical map and may explain why the total length of the 'cabernet sauvignon' physical map is  <dig>  fold the size of the grapevine genome.

identification of disease resistance gene homologues in the bac clones
three different classes of resistance genes  were searched for by pcr screening of  <dig>  bac clones and in silico screening of  <dig>  bac-end sequences .

the number of contigs anchored to the genetic map is indicated in brackets.

sixty-one out of  <dig> primer pairs tested for nbs-lrrs identified  <dig> non-redundant bac clones among which  <dig> were positive for two to three different primer pairs. then  <dig> grape ests analogous to nbs-lrrs matched  <dig> bes in a tblastx search. the corresponding bac clones were checked for redundancy with those identified by pcr:  <dig> bac clones were unique, raising the number of bac clones containing nbs-lrrs to  <dig> . most of these new bac clones were identified by est queries that span the lrr region  whereas queries spanning the nbs region mostly identified new bac clones from the half of the library not included in the 6× sub-library screened by pcr . four primer pairs targeting the rlk gene family identified  <dig> bac clones. the bes were queried using  <dig> rlk gene fragments, leading to the identification of  <dig> additional bac clones, which raised the total number to  <dig> 

thirty primer pairs targeting genes involved in non-host resistance and signalling pathways  allowed the identification of  <dig> bac clones, with an average of  <dig>  bac clones per primer pair. only the primer pair targeting sgt <dig> did not amplify any bac clone. the grapevine ests used for primer design were also used for blast search of bes and retrieved  <dig> bac clones. by combining pcr screening and in silico searches, the number of non redundant bac clones containing homologues for non-host resistance and defence signalling genes was raised to  <dig> 

physical organisation of nbs-lrr and rlk genes for host resistance
out of all  <dig>  bac clones that contained host resistance genes,  <dig>  bac clones  were assembled into  <dig> contigs among which  <dig>  contained nbs-lrr sequences. out of these,  <dig> were assigned to linkage groups by the reference markers of  <cit> . twenty-one additional contigs were anchored by other ssrs, raising the total number to  <dig>  which corresponds to 27% . as much as 16% of the contigs containing analogues to host resistance genes were positive for both nbs-lrr and rlk classes. in particular, rlks were found in contigs that also contained nbs-lrrs in 47% of the cases .

the contigs containing nbs-lrrs were present on all chromosomes with a skewed distribution within each chromosome, whereas the contigs containing rlks were more evenly dispersed across the genome . lgs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were the richest in nbs-lrrs, and lg  <dig> scored the highest number of contigs containing rlks .

physical localisation of non-host resistance gene homologues and genes for sa, ja, et, and mapk cascade signalling pathways
out of  <dig> bac clones that contained non-host resistance and signalling genes,  <dig>  were assembled into  <dig> contigs. out of these,  <dig> were anchored by the reference markers of  <cit>  and  <dig> by newly developed ssrs, raising the total number of anchored contigs to  <dig> for this category . contigs containing genes for non-host resistance and signalling pathways were evenly dispersed across the genome, even though contigs containing sequences homologous to genes of signalling pathways were more frequently found on lgs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . contigs positive for this category of genes contained host resistance gene analogues in 39% of the cases.

when the genome survey was restricted to the  <dig> bac clones on which homologues of non-host and signalling genes were identified by pcr, these bac clones were assembled into  <dig> contigs, corresponding to  <dig>  contigs per gene on average . at least one copy of each of the  <dig> genes studied, except sgt <dig>  was represented in the  <dig> contigs. for ten genes, two contigs per gene were found which might correspond to allelic contigs. this hypothesis is corroborated by the observation that the corresponding primer pair matched a single locus in the pn <dig> genome sequence. three or four contigs were found for the genes mpk <dig>  pbs <dig>  acd <dig>  and racb.

eleven genes were assigned to a physical contig which was anchored by the reference markers of  <cit> . ssr markers, linked to  <dig> unassigned genes, were newly developed . for two genes, microsatellites could be developed using the physical assembly. in these cases, microsatellites were found in the bes of another bac from the same contig. for  <dig> genes, microsatellites were developed using the pn <dig> genome sequence. the primer pairs of the gene, previously used to physically localise the gene in the bac clones, were used for a blastn search of the genome sequence. when perfect matches for the primer sites were found, a search was performed for microsatellites in the assembled sequence within a 40-kbp interval around the gene. these new markers were mapped using either of the two mapping populations reported in  <cit>  and projected onto the reference map of  <cit> .

four genes  were physically assigned to contigs but the corresponding contigs could not be genetically anchored by any available marker. two genes, jar <dig> and acd <dig>  were physically assigned to contigs that remained genetically unmapped, but the primer pairs of each gene had a perfect match on two scaffolds of the genome sequence attributed to lg  <dig> and lg  <dig>  respectively. sgt <dig> was not physically assigned to any bac clone but a unique sequence of the gene was found on the genome assembly, and a new ssr marker found within a 3-kbp interval around the gene  was mapped to lg  <dig> 

a genomic position of the highest identical analogue could thus be assigned to  <dig> out of the initial  <dig> non-host and resistance signalling genes that were initially searched for in the bac library . the position of each gene was validated by the perfect match of corresponding primer pair on the anchored scaffolds of the pn <dig> genome sequence.

genes causing interference with cell wall penetration of biotrophs, like pen <dig> and mlo in arabidopsis and barley  <cit> , account for resistance against powdery mildews, a disease important also to grape. the grape homologue of pen <dig> is located on lg  <dig>  and the homologue of the broad spectrum resistance gene mlo is located on lg  <dig>  various plant genes, like lipase-like eds <dig>  glycerol kinase nho <dig>  and ubiquitin ligase-associated protein sgt <dig>  can halt infection after a non-host pathogen has penetrated  <cit> . grapevine homologues of eds <dig> and sgt <dig> were localised to lg  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, however, the homologue of nho <dig> could not be localised using this approach. sa, ja/et, and mapk cascades are components of the signalling networks that are required for mounting inducible defences through specific routes to the non-host and the host defence. we localised the grape homologues of sa synthesis and signalling genes, such as sid <dig> , ndr <dig> , eds <dig> , and npr <dig> ; of ja synthesis and signalling, such as aos , coi <dig> , and jar <dig> ; et-insensitive etr <dig> ; and map kinases, such as sipk , wipk , edr <dig> , and mpk <dig> . complete resistance, triggered by many r genes, also requires the interacting proteins rar <dig>  and sgt <dig>  found on lg <dig> as well  <cit> . among other genes involved in the activation of the hr, the homologue of the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel gene dnd <dig>  associated with a host resistance that is uncoupled from cell death in arabidopsis, was located at the bottom of lg <dig> in the grape genome. racb, the grape homologue of osrac <dig> that acts as a component of the programmed cell death  pathway in rice, was located on lg <dig>  the homologue of accelerated cell death  <dig>  was located on lg <dig> 

discussion
the 'cabernet sauvignon' physical map described here is the second one constructed for a highly heterozygous grapevine cultivar, while the first one was based on 'pinot noir'  <cit> . both of them were assembled using the same fingerprinting method. a common feature of both maps is that the total length of the contigs is much larger than the estimated size of the grape genome . in the 'cabernet sauvignon' map, this expansion was mainly attributed to the effects of heterozygosity. 'cabernet sauvignon' is an offspring of the cross between 'cabernet franc' and 'sauvignon blanc'  <cit> . genotyping with ssr markers showed a high level of heterozygosity for this cultivar  <cit> . in 'pinot noir', it was recently shown that an important part of the sequence variation is due to insertion/deletion events, and that the frequency of snps is uneven  <cit> . the same features were observed in a preliminary experiment that compared two haplotype sequences in 'cabernet sauvignon' over two different genomic regions encompassing  <dig> kbp . these features affect the banding pattern of the fingerprints produced from two allelic regions, and were thus expected to hamper the proper assembly of the corresponding bac clones. the use of a set of bac-anchored molecular markers with a unique position on the reference genome sequence, and checks of the alignment of the bac clones using their bes on the same genome sequence proved that heterozygosity could lead to either a patchy ordering of heterozygous clones within a contig or to a separation of 'allelic' clones in two separate contigs. both phenomena explain the observed  <dig> -fold expansion of the physical map. indeed, while 55% of the single-locus markers were found on allelic bac clones that belonged to the same contig, the remaining 45% anchored two or more contigs.

these limitations, which cause difficulties in the proper assembly of bac clones, are a common feature of physical maps produced for genomes of heterozygous species. up to now, only three fingerprinting-based physical maps have been assembled for heterozygous plants other than grape: prunus  <cit> , apple  <cit> , and black cottonwood  <cit> . the peach map was constructed using the same fingerprinting method as in grapevine, but other differences impair the comparison of the two assemblies. first, mapping in peach is still ongoing, and the clones fingerprinted so far, which represent  <dig> × genome equivalents, are biased towards the expressed regions of the genome  <cit> . second, two bac libraries were used in peach, one obtained from a diploid genotype and the other from a haploid one, which could have attenuated the effect of heterozygosity. the black cottonwood and the apple maps show a  <dig> -fold expansion of the genome size  <cit> . this value is lower compared to the ones found in grapevine, which may be somewhat explained by the use of agarose fingerprinting for producing the black cottonwood and the apple maps. according to  <cit> , the confounding effect of bands that correspond to restricted repetitive elements, and the differences in fragment size caused by insertions/deletions of a few bases are likely to be more neutral in agarose fingerprinting than in sequencer-based methods, due to the larger size of the analysed fragments. in poplar, when aligning bes to the genome sequence, it was observed that two physical contigs frequently stuck to the same interval over the sequence  <cit> , suggesting that separation of allelic contigs occurred as it did in the grapevine physical map. if a single haplotype was counted for each of the contig pairs that co-aligned over the sequence, then the overall estimation of the size of the physical map showed almost no expansion  <cit> . finally, the black cottonwood map indicated that the whole genome duplication that occurred in the salicaceae lineage impacted the physical map far less than the heterozygosity did  <cit> . if this holds true for a recent genome doubling, the effect of homeology in grapevine and other eudicots that share an ancient hexaploid origin should be even more negligible.

a validation of contig assembly of the 'cabernet sauvignon' map, based on independent controls from genetic markers and the pn <dig> genome sequence, led us to estimate that  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the contigs built by fpc are chimaeras. until now, the percentage of chimerical contigs in physical maps have been estimated in only few cases. a contig assembly error of 5% was reported in the channel catfish physical map  <cit> , which was also built using the  <cit>  method. the maize map, which was constructed with a three-colour based hicf method, showed 4% of false joins  <cit> . the percentage of chimaeras observed in the present work is close to this range. physical chimerism may arise from common fingerprint bands corresponding to repetitive sequences or large-scale duplications shared by physically unlinked bac clones. the ways in which transposable elements might interfere with wgs assembly were argued in rice  <cit> , and the same arguments may also apply to misplacing of bac clones in physical contigs of the grape physical map.

knowing all of these limitations, we showed however that a physical map can be a useful complement to a genetic map to localize a set of candidate genes for agronomical traits. the physical map has been used to produce an inventory of genes, anchored to the chromosomes, potentially involved in resistance against pathogens. an overview of the genomic distribution of the physical contigs positive for different classes of genes is given . this picture is very close to the analysis of the same gene families based on the sequence draft of 'pinot noir'  <cit> , confirming the reliability of the physical mapping approach.

based on the locations found for homologues of non-host resistance or signalling pathways, none of them reveal a positional candidate that's position corresponds with a known qtl for disease resistance  <cit> . by contrast, several physical contigs containing nbs-lrr genes were tagged by markers that are linked to major qtls or genes for disease resistance reported in literature  <cit> . in most of these cases, the segregation of resistance suggested that several loci might contribute to the trait, but the loci tagged by the markers, that now correspond to contigs rich in nbs-lrrs, accounted for the largest effect  <cit> . due to the difficulty in handling quantitative trait studies in a controlled environment for a perennial woody plant like grapevine, most of the experiments were carried out with small segregating populations, which allowed a reliable detection of only one or a few qtls with the strongest effect. increasing the sensitivity and resolution of qtl analysis may provide further information on the position of additional loci that contribute to the remaining part of phenotypic variance. our work also provides markers that could improve the marker density of genetic maps in these regions and that could be used for marker assisted selection in breeding programs.

CONCLUSIONS
a vitis vinifera 'cabernet sauvignon' physical map was constructed and a large set of candidate genes for pathogen resistances were anchored on it. two main aspects were addressed which could be useful for further projects in the field of genomics.

first, the paper focused on the effects of high levels of heterozygosity on fingerprint-based physical maps. it was showed that an appropriate automated protocol could produce a proper assembly by reducing the impact of this potentially hampering factor.

second, the map appeared to be a useful and reliable intermediary step between a genetic map and the genome sequence for the positioning of candidate genes. it allowed the quick mapping of complex families of genes, and strengthened previous clues of co-localisation of major nbs-lrr clusters and disease resistance loci.
