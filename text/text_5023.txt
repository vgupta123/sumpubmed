BACKGROUND
the transparency and refraction properties of a normal, healthy cornea are predominantly mediated by its avascularity. however, many pathological processes affecting the cornea, including trauma, inflammation, infection, toxicity and nutritional insults, may lead to corneal neovascularization  <cit> . while this process may be beneficial in wound healing, clearance of infections and arresting progressive immune-mediated corneal melts, neovascularization may reduce corneal transparency by growing into the normally vascular-free cornea tissue, bleeding into the cornea and causing lipid deposition, tissue swelling and scarring  <cit> . corneal neovascularization may significantly impair visual acuity and the immune privilege of the cornea, and may also worsen the prognosis of corneal transplantation  <cit> . the prevalence of corneal neovascularization ranges from  <dig> - <dig>  individuals in the population wearing soft contact lenses  <cit>  and is associated with the second most common cause of blindness globally, and with the most common form of corneal blindness in developed countries  <cit> .

clinical ophthalmologists have been challenged with the treatment of sight-threatening corneal neovascularization for over  <dig> years  <cit> . however, because age-related maculopathy is the major cause of blindness in the aged population in developed world, the anterior segment neovascularization inhibition still lags behind anti-angiogenesis at the posterior pole of the eye  <cit> . the current clinical treatment for corneal angiogenesis primarily involves direct anti-angiogenesis agents , indirect anti-angiogenesis agents   <cit> , laser photocoagulation, fine-needle diathermy, photodynamic therapy  <cit>  and conjunctival, limbal or amniotic membrane transplantation. however, regular application of corticosteroids may increase the risk of infection and induce cataracts and glaucoma  <cit> . other methods of treatment often require multiple treatment sessions with risks of severe complication arising, since significantly more laser energy is needed than that used for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization. furthermore, photodynamic therapy, which is reported to significantly inhibit corneal neovascularization, only blocks existing neovascularization, but does not prevent pathological angiogenesis. currently, treatments targeting the molecular mediators of angiogenesis are widely studied and represent the ideal choice for therapy. vegf is a major mediator of the angiogenic process. numerous therapeutic strategies targeting vegf are being studied  <cit> . new therapeutic agents, including pegaptanib, ranibizumab and particularly bevacizumab, are reported to be effective in inhibiting corneal neovascularization. however, the extremely high annual treatment cost of these agents has limited their widespread use and systemic adverse events have been reported  <cit> .

the design and development of peptides to inhibit angiogenesis is an important area in anti-angiogenic drug development  <cit> . in comparison to proteins, peptides display lower immunogenicity, higher solubility in water, stable production methods, improved consistency between batches and are superior at targeting and penetrating tumors  <cit> . previously, we identified a novel peptide, h-rn, derived from the hepatocyte growth factor kringle  <dig> domain , and demonstrated that it has anti-angiogenic activity to retinal neovascularization in a mouse model  <cit> . in the current study, we further investigated the ability of h-rn to inhibit corneal neovascularization and possible anti-angiogenesis mechanisms. our study may lead to new potential drug discoveries and the development of novel treatments for pathological retinal and corneal angiogenesis.

RESULTS
h-rn inhibits huvec proliferation
to investigate the effect of h-rn on huvec proliferation, cells were exposed to vegf  alone and in combination with various concentrations of h-rn or scrambled peptide for  <dig> h. in comparison with control cells, treatment with vegf alone induced a significant increase in cell proliferation . treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of h-rn peptide resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation , reaching maximal inhibition at  <dig> mm h-rn. in contrast, treatment of cells with scrambled peptide had no inhibitory effect . these results indicate that h-rn impairs vegf-induced huvec proliferation.

huvecs migration towards vegf is inhibited by h-rn
next, we investigated the ability of h-rn to affect the migration of huvecs using transwell migration assays. compared to control, vegf significantly stimulated huvec migration through the porous membrane of transwell chambers . various concentrations of h-rn  were then added to test the inhibitory effect of this peptide on vegf-induced huvecs migration. scrambled peptide was added as control. the results showed that h-rn significantly inhibited cell migration, especially at  <dig> nm and  <dig> μm  compared with control scrambled peptide  .

h-rn inhibits huvec tube formation in matrigel
we next assessed the ability of h-rn to affect tube formation in matrigel. as shown in figure  <dig>  tube formation was strongly stimulated by vegf . huvec tube formation was effectively inhibited following treatment with h-rn, especially at concentrations of  <dig> μm and above . in contrast, scrambled peptide did not inhibit vegf-induced endothelium tube formation at any concentration .

h-rn inhibits corneal angiogenesis in a mouse model
to investigate the effect of h-rn in vivo, we investigated the effect of h-rn on corneal angiogenesis. the growth of new capillary vessels from the corneal limbus towards implanted pellets containing vegf or vegf combined with peptides was assessed  <dig> days post-implantation. no new vessels were observed in pellets containing pbs only. corneal neovascularization towards a pellet containing vegf was vigorous. in contrast, neovascularization towards pellets containing both vegf and h-rn was significantly inhibited compared to vegf only, particularly at 5 μg h-rn . for quantitative analysis, the vessel area was calculated according to the maximal vessel length and clock hours. the vessel area decreased significantly in the h-rn group when compared with vegf alone . these results demonstrate that h-rn exhibits an inhibitory effect on vegf-induced angiogenesis in the mouse cornea.

the effect of h-rn on the anti-apoptosis activity of vegf
huvecs were starved overnight and treated with various agents and apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. annexin v-fitc-/pi- cells located in the bottom left quadrant represent viable cells. early apoptotic cells  located in the bottom right quadrant represent early apoptotic cells. following treatment of huvecs with vegf , early apoptotic huvecs decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. however, exposure of cells to increasing concentrations of h-rn, led to an increase in the percentage of early apoptotic cells to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  . these results demonstrate that vegf protects huvecs from apoptosis, but that h-rn may inhibit this effect.

h-rn induces cell cycle arrest of huvecs in g0/g <dig> phase
to examine the effect of h-rn on cell growth, huvecs were incubated with vegf or h-rn for  <dig> h and cell cycle was assessed by pi staining and flow cytometry. treatment of huvecs with vegf significantly increased the proportion of cells in the s phase , and in g2/m phase  compared to untreated control cells. treatment of cells with h-rn  led to accumulation of cells in the g0/g <dig> phase  and a significant decrease in the proportion of cells in s phase  and g2/m phase, compared to control untreated cells .

discussion
corneal neovascularization may be caused by several pathogenic conditions, including inflammatory, ischemic, degenerative or traumatic diseases of the cornea and loss of the limbal stem cell barrier. to date, numerous models of corneal angiogenesis have been developed. thermal injury and alkali-burn models have been utilized in many studies, since these are easy to perform and corneal neovascularization may be conveniently observed  <cit> . inflammation is the major mechanism of cornea angiogenesis in these models and these models were predominantly used in studies focused on inflammation. infectious keratitis and corneal ulcers, which brought unstable experimental results and difficulties to precise quantitative analysis, are also commonly seen in these models. mouse tumor models induce corneal neovascularization by intrastromal implantation of tumor cells in the rat or mouse cornea, where vessel growth is stimulated by tumor-secreted angiogenic factors, inflammation or immunologic mediators  <cit> . we previously reported the anti-angiogenic activity of h-rn in a choroid-retinal endothelial cell line , in the chick chorioallantoic membrane and in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy  <cit> .

in the present study, we investigated the anti-angiogenic effect of h-rn in vegf-induced corneal neovascularization in vitro using huvecs, and in vivo using a mouse cornea micropocket assay, which is dependent on direct stimulation of neovascularization rather than indirect stimulation by inflammation or tumors. our results obtained from both in vitro and in vivo models were highly reproducible and easily quantifiable  <cit> . in addition, vegf was used as a direct angiogenesis stimulator in the models, thus providing meaningful results for the evaluation of an anti-vegf and anti-angiogenic reagent.

previously, we reported a new peptide derived from hgf, h-rn, which exhibited anti-angiogenic activity in a choroid-retinal endothelial cell line  and in the chick chorioallantoic membrane, as well as in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy  <cit> . in the present study, we investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of h-rn on corneal neovascularization. huvecs were used for in vitro studies, and the effects of h-rn on vegf-stimulated proliferation, cell migration and endothelial cell tube formation were investigated. similar results were found as those obtained from our in vitro study of rf/6a cells. h-rn significantly inhibited huvec proliferation, migration and tube formation stimulated by vegf. the inhibitory effects were particularly intense at high concentrations, though not dose-dependent. the scrambled peptide did not show any inhibitory effect at any concentration. in the mouse cornea micropocket assay, we found that vegf significantly stimulated corneal angiogenesis. neovascularization derived from the corneal limbus developed towards vegf-containing pellets, with bushy and thick vessels migrating towards and over the surface of the white pellet. this growth was significantly inhibited following administration of h-rn. we infer that h-rn has the potential for treating pathological corneal neovascularization, and sustained release delivery may be an effective drug delivery option, although further investigation of h-rn pharmacokinetics is still required.

li et al.  <cit>  recently reported that topical administration of kh <dig>  a recombinant human soluble vegf receptor fusion protein, was capable of significantly inhibiting angiogenesis in an alkali burn corneal neovascularization rabbit model by topical administration. kh <dig> was administrated in three different concentrations;  <dig> mg/ml,  <dig> mg/ml and  <dig> mg/ml. rabbits received topical administration  of the different solutions four times daily for  <dig> days. corneal neovascularization was analyzed  <dig> and  <dig> days after chemical cauterization. in this study, corneal neovascularization was significantly reduced in kh906-treated groups compared to control treated animals. compared to the effective peptide quantity in our study, the total drug quantity applied in li’s study is much higher , indicating that h-rn has a much lower effective concentration than kh- <dig>  furthermore, the treatment cycle of h-rn is significantly shorter than kh- <dig> , and the production cost of h-rn is also lower than kh- <dig>  in this study, the level of vegf in the cornea in kh906-treated groups was significantly decreased. in our study, we found that the ability of h-rn to inhibit the anti-apoptotic activity of vegf and to induce g0/g <dig> phase cell cycle arrest is related to its anti-angiogenesis properties. taken together, this demonstrates that both h-rn and kh- <dig> inhibit neovascularization through an anti-vegf mechanism.

previous reports have shown that vegf may inhibit vascular endothelial cell apoptosis  <cit> . we infer that h-rn may inhibit the anti-apoptosis activity of vegf, as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis. it is well established that vegf inhibits endothelial cells apoptosis via activation of the pi3k signaling pathway  <cit>  and by upregulating the expression of bcl- <dig> and a <dig>  <cit> , important anti-apoptosis genes. additional studies are required to determine whether h-rn inhibits activation of the pi3k signaling pathway or the expression of bcl- <dig> and a <dig>  we further investigated the effect of h-rn on the cell cycle of huvecs, which may relate to its inhibitory effect on endothelial cell proliferation. we observed a g0/g <dig> phase arrest in h-rn treated cells, indicating that h-rn inhibits dna replication of huvecs. cyclin, cyclin dependent kinase   <cit>  and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor   <cit>  are critical factors regulating the cell cycle. future studies will aim to investigate the relationship between h-rn and these factors.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we show that h-rn, a small peptide derived from hgf, displays anti-angiogenic activity in huvecs and effectively inhibits vegf-induced corneal angiogenesis in a mouse model. while our study indicates that the anti-angiogenic activity of h-rn is related to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, further studies investigating the mechanisms underlying the anti-angiogenic activity of h-rn are necessary.
