BACKGROUND
the pharmacological action of cyclosporin a and fk506/tacrolimus is mediated by cytosolic immunophilins namely cyclophilin a and the fk <dig> binding protein  <dig> kda . the drug immunophilin complex binds to and inhibits the protein phosphatase calcineurin thus preventing signal transduction in activated t cells  <cit> . fkbps are a family of proteins that were found from procaryotes to humans. at least  <dig> human fkbps are known and can be found in every tissue so far analyzed. some fkbps bind to and "stabilize" intracellular receptors. for example, fkbp <dig> and fkbp <dig>  interact with the ryanodine ca2+ channels ryr <dig> and ryr <dig>  respectively  <cit> . fkbp <dig> is part of the steroid receptor complex  <cit> . another fkbp, fkbp <dig>  is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. fkbp <dig> mrna is up-regulated in the presence of unfolded proteins, e.g. after tunicamycin treatment and heat shock and it is regarded to act as a chaperone  <cit> . on the other hand fkbp <dig> was shown to interact specifically with single proteins like a homologue of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeletal protein  <dig>  and a fkbp associated protein  <dig> kda  <cit> . finally, fkbp <dig> was described to be a nuclear protein and the transcription factor yy <dig> or histone deacetylases  specifically interact with this fkbp family member  <cit> .

the phylogenetically ancient complement system composed of more than  <dig> proteins is part of the immunogenic system including a cascade of interacting proteins called c <dig> to c <dig>  activation finally leads to lysis of marked cells. c <dig>  the first protein in this cascade, is composed of one c1q and two c1r and c1s proteins. while c1q binds the fc regions of two iggs or one igm molecule, c1r and c1s are known to activate other components of the pathway, namely c <dig> and c <dig> 

c1q contains  <dig> polypeptide chains  and is composed of six globular heads linked via six collagen like stalks to a fibril-like central region  <cit> . each of the globular heads is formed by association of the c-terminal region of an a-, b-, and c-chain.

in addition c1q seems to play an important role as an immunmodulator in its own and has pathophysiological impact. c1q deficient individuals develop a systemic lupus erythematodes -like disease  <cit>  and c1q deficient mice show elevated auto-antibody titres and develop glomerulonephritis and renal damage probably because of accumulation of apoptotic bodies  <cit> . as c1q can bind to a variety of pathologically relevant targets in an antibody-independent manner it might directly activate cellular functions. indeed, several receptors for c1q have been described. c1qrp is a putative receptor for phagocytosis enhancement by monocytes  <cit> . the rodent homologue of c1qrp is tightly regulated during development  <cit> . c1q was shown to bind to cell lines expressing the complement receptor  <dig>  in a saturable manner  <cit> . a receptor for the collagenous domains of c1q has been purified and was shown to be idenical to calreticulin  <cit> . finally, a binding protein for the globular head of c1q  was isolated  <cit> .

in this work interaction of the c-chain of complement c1q  with a member of the fk <dig> binding protein  family was detected and the specificity of the interaction was further investigated.

RESULTS
yeast two-hybrid screen
the physiological function of immunophilins in endocrine systems is rarely characterized. a commercially available fetal human liver cdna expression library was used to identify proteins that interact with the immunophilin fkbp <dig> which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. plasmids encoding fkbp <dig> without signal peptide fused to the lexa-dbd  and the liver cdna library were sequentially transformed into yeast l <dig>  ten million yeast double transformants  were screened and selected for histidine prototrophy. among  <dig> colonies isolated as his+,  <dig> were found to display beta-galactosidase  activity. plasmids were isolated from each of these clones and were used for retransformation of yeast l <dig> pretransformed with pbtm-fkbp13w/os. six clones remained positive  and turned out to code for five different cdnas after sequence analysis. one of the clones  representing the cdna of the c-chain of complement c <dig> corresponding to amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> was selected for the present study. the interaction of a second clone with fkbps was described elsewhere  <cit> .

interaction of full length c-chain of c1q with fkbp <dig> and with other fkbps
fkbps share a common binding motif for the immunosuppressant fk <dig>  to check the specificity of the fkbp13/c1q-c interaction, yeast l <dig> was cotransformed with a plasmid coding for the full length c1q-c-gal4ad hybrid protein lacking a  <dig> amino acids signal peptide  and different plasmids each of them coding for fkbp <dig>  fkbp13w/os, fkbp <dig>  and fkbp <dig> fused in frame to the dbd of lexa . cotransformants were checked for histidine prototrophy and β-gal activity. only fkbp <dig> interacted with the c1q-cw/os protein in the yeast two-hybrid system whereas fkbp <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> failed in this respect.

interaction of c1q-c with cyclophilin a
cyclophilins are the second family of immunophilins. to check for cross reactivity, binding of c1q-cw/os to the prototype of cyclophilins, cyclophilin a , was investigated in the same system. yeast l <dig> was cotransformed with a plasmid expressing lexa-cypa hybrids  and pgad-c1q-cw/os and was tested for β-gal activity and histidine prototrophy. c1q-cw/os and cypa failed to interact in the yeast two-hybrid system.

interaction of c1q-c with fkbp <dig> in a protein complementation assay
in order to verify the results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid screen, the gst pull-down approach was used first. as the expression of c1q-cw/os either in a coupled reticulocyte lysate system or in bacteria failed, the interaction of c1q-cw/os with fkbp13w/os was analyzed in a protein complementation assay. ins- <dig> cells were cotransformed with a plasmid coding for fkbp13w/os fused in frame via a  <dig> amino acid peptide linker to aa  <dig> to  <dig> of β-lactamase  and a plasmid coding for β-lactamase aa  <dig> to  <dig> fused in frame via a  <dig> amino acid peptide linker to c1q-cw/os . as shown in fig.  <dig>  cotransformation of the hybrid-proteins resulted in β-lactamase activity; the interaction of c1q-cw/os with fkbp13w/os was confirmed by using this second assay.

interaction of c1q-c with fkbp <dig> in the presence of fk506
the crystal structure of fk506/fkbp complexes predicts that the recognition site in the endogenous ligand equivalent to fk <dig> would best be emulated by a iso-pro or leu-pro motif  <cit> . fk <dig> might mimic the binding motif of c1q-c to fkbp <dig>  for this reason, the influence of the drug on the interaction of c1q-cw/os with fkbp13w/os was investigated in the yeast two-hybrid system. cotransformants of yeast l <dig> with pgad-c1q-cw/os and pbtm-fkbp13w/os were incubated in the presence or absence of fk <dig>  cells were collected and measured for β-gal activity. as shown in figure  <dig>  fk <dig> does not decrease the interaction of c1q-c with fkbp <dig>  but rather seems to increase the affinity of c1q-c to the fkbp at low micromolar concentrations. the interaction of c1q-c with fkbp <dig> could not be suppressed, even in the presence of  <dig> μm fk <dig> 

discussion
the c-chain of complement c1q interacts with fkbp13
a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using the fk <dig> binding protein  <dig> kda  as a bait and a human liver expression library as a prey. the screen revealed the c-chain of complement c1q  to interact with fkbp <dig>  three other fkbps, namely fkbp <dig>  fkbp <dig> and fkbp <dig> failed to interfere with c1q-c under same conditions indicating specificity for the positive result in the yeast system. the interaction of c1q-c with fkbp <dig> was proved by using additionally a protein complementation assay , demonstrating that the interaction of c1q-c with the fkbp <dig> was not an artifact in the yeast two-hybrid system. the interaction of c1q-c with fkbp <dig> in the pca seems to be comparable to the interaction of the two gcn <dig> leucine zippers  which were used as a positive control. the intensity of the interaction might depend on the efficiency of the cell transfection, cell density, cell growth, and other factors but hydrolysis rates of nitrocefin as a marker of the interaction are clearly different from the negative control which can be best seen after  <dig> min of incubation . the verification of the interaction in a classical gst pull-down assay was used elsewhere  <cit>  but failed in this work as the rather small c1q-c protein could not be produced and labelled in vitro . immunoprecipitation of the interacting proteins was not planned since a c1q-c antibody is not available. the interaction, therefore, of c1q-c with different fkbps was demonstrated in two independent approaches albeit the presence of an additional cellular factor necessary for the interaction can not be excluded with these cellular assays.

the c-chain of complement c1q does not interact with cyclophilin a
immunophilins belong to the class of peptidyl prolyl isomerases . they can be divided into fkbps that bind for example fk506/tacrolimus or rapamycin and cyclophilins that mediate the pharmacological action of cyclosporin a . cyclophilin a  can be regarded as the prototype of the cyclophilins. unlike the aforementioned fkbp <dig>  the immunophilin cypa does not interfere with c1q-c in the yeast two-hybrid system underlining the specificity of the interaction of c1q-c with fkbp <dig> 

fk <dig> fails to negatively influence the fkbp <dig> c1q-c interaction
the immunosuppressive drug fk <dig> is not able to decrease the affinity of c1q-c to fkbp <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid system even when used in a concentration of  <dig> micromolar. the common binding motif of fkbps for fk <dig> is, therefore, less likely to be uniquely involved in the c1q-c fkbp <dig> interaction. on the other hand, at low micromolar concentrations fk <dig> seems to „strengthen" the interaction of c1q-c with fkbp <dig>  possibly, c1q-c, when produced artificially in yeast, binds to yeast fkbp as well and has to be liberated from these interfering positions by fk <dig>  then contributing to the interaction with the fkbp13-ad hybrid protein. an excess of fk <dig> should further diminish the c1q-c fkbp <dig> interaction but the drug cannot be tested in the milimolar range because of its toxicity. the influence of fk <dig> on the interaction of the two proteins was not investigated in a mammalian cell line because the influence in the yeast system is more likely comparable to other investigations . additionally the immunosuppressive agent is expected to be far toxic in the micromolar range when used in a mammalian cell system. finally, a negative effect of the immunosuppressive drug on the c1q-c fkbp <dig> complex could not be demonstrated albeit the involvement of the fk <dig> binding pocket in the interaction cannot be excluded.

CONCLUSIONS
using two different experimental approaches, the c-chain of complement c1q was shown to interact with fkbp <dig>  fkbp <dig>  initially used as the bait for the yeast two-hybrid screen in this work, is regarded as an endoplasmic reticulum  protein. it might act as a chaperone but specifically interacts with other proteins like a homologue of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskleletal protein  <dig>  or the fkbp associated protein  <dig> , too. fkbp <dig> was detected in membrane preparations from erythrocytes as well, demonstrating that its expression and maintenance is not restricted to the er  <cit> . the c-chain of complement c1q is part of the c1q molecule that is composed of six a-, six b-, and six c-chains, respectively. interaction of fkbp <dig> with the a- or b-chain or with the entire c1q molecule has not been investigated yet. the carboxy-terminal part of the c-chain is sufficient to interact with fkbp <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid system. if the entire c1q molecule interacts with fkbp <dig>  interaction of its globular head with the immunophilin will be likely therefore, as the globular head is is formed by association of the c-terminal regions of an a-, b-, and c-chain. on the other hand, fkbp <dig> might act as a specific chaperone, triggering c1q-c in the endoplasmic reticulum and preventing the complement protein to interact with other intracellular proteins. further work will be necessary to elucidate the physiological significance of the interaction of the two proteins and to investigate whether fkbp <dig> plays an important role in the complement system, too.
