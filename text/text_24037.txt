BACKGROUND
fusarium wilt and root rot caused by members of the fusarium oxysporum species complex  are major constraints to the production of horticultural, cotton, and legume crops worldwide. f. oxysporum is a globally ubiquitous soil-borne fungus  <cit>  and is one of the most important plant-pathogens of the fusarium genus, having been ranked 5th in a list of the top  <dig> plant pathogens of scientific/economic importance  <cit> . while some f. oxysporum isolates are non-pathogenic saprophytes and may even have symbiotic or bio-control properties  <cit>  this species notably contains more than  <dig> host-specific plant-pathogenic sub-species  <cit> , known as formae speciales . each of which cause disease on a narrow range of host plant species and which may be further divided into races or pathotypes and additionally vegetative compatibility groups  <cit> .

many fungi have evolved the ability to attack living plants rather than obtain nutrients saprophytically and the invasion is often facilitated by effector molecules that interact with the host plant’s immune system . in some fungal genera, including fusarium, genes encoding the production of these molecules have evolved on chromosomal regions that are not required for saprophytic growth and are thus known as ‘conditionally dispensable chromosomes’  in contrast to ‘core’ chromosomes whose gene content is essential and conserved across generations  <cit> . dispensable genomic regions encoding genes that play a role in pathogenicity and host-specificity, including effector genes, have been identified in fusarium isolates infecting a range of plant hosts . cdcs have also been identified in other fungal species  <cit>  including several ascomycete phytopathogens , and have been found to play important roles in pathogenicity and host-range delineation  <cit> . the first fusarium cdc identified was from f. solani  and contained a cluster of six pea-pathogenicity  genes involved in detoxifying the plant defence compound pisatin produced by the garden pea, pisum sativum . for some fusarium species including the tomato-infecting f. oxysporum f. sp lycopersici , the genes residing on cdcs define its host range and these chromosomes when transferred to non-pathogenic species can confer pathogenicity on a new host. dispensable regions of the genome are presumed to be maintained while they convey an evolutionary advantage, either to allow for adaptation of novel genes separately from regions containing core conserved genes, or to allow for the transfer of genetic material e.g. conferring pathogenicity on a new host. the clustering of genes important for pathogenicity on a small cdc chromosome  that could be transferred would provide a highly selective advantage for a ‘one step’ horizontal transfer event that could enable an isolate to become pathogenic on a new host  <cit> . presumably genes that do not confer pathogenicity on the new host would be more susceptible to shuffling and subsequent loss, as has been observed for fol and f. solani cdcs relative to core chromosomes  <cit> .

genomic mapping and sequencing of fusarium species has revealed chromosome numbers to be highly plastic, ranging from 4– <dig>  <cit> . the common ancestor species has been proposed to have only  <dig> chromosomes, with the increase in chromosome number due in part to the presence of cdcs which are thought to have originated in f. oxysporum via horizontal transmission from other fusarium species  <cit> . gene content in cdcs is often relatively sparse but enriched in transposable elements. for example, less than 1/ <dig> of fol pathogenicity cdc  <dig> is predicted to encode protein coding genes and these are predominately proteins of unknown function. in comparison to core chromosomes, cdcs are enriched for pathogenicity-associated proteins, secreted proteins and proteins involved in secondary metabolism  <cit> . some fol cdc genes important for pathogenicity encode the secreted-in-xylem  effector proteins  <cit> , and are often associated with distinct repeat types  <cit> . six proteins, first identified in the xylem sap of fol-infected tomato plants, are small, secreted and often cysteine-rich  <cit> . so far  <dig> families of six proteins have been identified, sharing little similarity with each other or other known fungal proteins . several have characterised roles in virulence and/or avirulence with their cognate host r-genes identified , although for the most part their biological function within the host remain unknown.

members of the fusarium genus are major constraints to global grain and forage legume production. fusarium wilts and root rots caused by species such as f. oxysporum, f. solani, f. udum, and f. virguliforme are a major problem for a number of important legume crops including chickpea, pea, soybean, lentil, lupin, alfalfa, common bean and pigeon pea causing losses upwards of 10 % annually, but in many cases complete loss  <cit> . these crops provide a high protein food source to a large proportion of the world’s population as well as serving as a source of livestock feed  <cit> . in addition, they improve the soil through nitrogen fixation and are often used in rotational cropping systems to provide disease breaks.

in this study we generate, inspect and compare the assembled genome sequences and functional annotation of three legume-infecting formae speciales of the fosc, adding to the increasing list of available f. oxysporum ff. spp. genome assemblies, with none that infect legumes, the third-largest family of higher plants, previously published. these isolates, f. oxysporum f. sp. medicaginis , f. oxysporum f. sp. ciceris  and f. oxysporum f. sp. pisi  are causal agents of fusarium wilt on medicago species  and the model legume medicago truncatula), chickpea  and pea  respectively. the legume-infecting ff. spp. discussed herein exhibit a similar infection cycle to fol, favoured by warm soil temperatures . the hyphae of germinated conidia colonize and penetrate the root epidermis, move inter-cellularly through the root cortex and into the xylem. as shown for the model legume m. truncatula in additional file 2a and for c. arietinum in 2b, extensive colonisation of the vascular system leads to water stress, wilting and bleaching of stems and leaves, followed by necrosis and eventually plant death.

chickpea and pea are the second and third most important legume crops worldwide, with chickpea the most important in india, due to its high protein content . foc is a major pathogen of chickpea typically accounting for 10-15 % of yield losses worldwide  <cit>  and can be transmitted via seed  <cit>  but can also survive in the soil for long periods. foc has two known pathotypes, that cause either yellowing or wilt  <cit> , and eight pathogenic races  although it is proposed to be one of the few f. oxysporum ff. spp. that is monophyletic  <cit> . the isolate sequenced in this study foc-38- <dig>  represents the most virulent race of this forma specialis  which shows wide geographic distribution throughout india, the largest producer of chickpeas  <cit>  and is capable of causing complete loss of grain yield  <cit> . in fop four races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been described  <cit>  and the isolate sequenced in this study belongs to race  <dig>  medicago spp. are pasture crops typically used for rotation and fodder  <cit> , although alfalfa  is also grown for human consumption, and m. truncatula is a notable model plant species  <cit> . the corresponding pathogenic f. sp.  of m. truncatula is therefore of relevance as a model for the study of plant-pathogen interactions in legumes while also having bearing on alfalfa/lucerne, the world’s major temperate forage crop  <cit> . the race of the isolate sequenced in this study fom-5190a is not known, as in this f. sp. races are yet to be defined.

in this work, we focus our analysis on identifying regions of the new legume-infecting f. oxysporum genomes that may be relevant to plant pathogenicity in part by predicting potential cd regions and coupling this knowledge with in planta expression during f. oxysporum- infection of the model legume m. truncatula. this process led to the identification of several effector candidates and conserved pathogenicity factors across the legume infecting ff. spp., that we speculate play a role in inducing disease on legume hosts.

RESULTS
genome features and organisation
the fom-5190a and foc-38- <dig> genomes were assembled using a combination of paired-end, mate-pair and long-jumping distance illumina libraries with additional  <dig> sequencing used for fom-5190a as described in the methods and additional file  <dig>  the fom-5190a genome was sequenced at ~170x coverage  and assembled into  <dig> scaffolds with a total length of ~ <dig>  mb and encoding  <dig>  proteins. the foc-38- <dig> genome was sequenced at ~577x coverage  and assembled into  <dig> scaffolds, totalling ~ <dig>  mb encoding for  <dig>  proteins. the whole-genome sequence of fop nrrl strain  <dig> had a final 260× physical coverage generated from two libraries using illumina sequencing technology. the final assembly encompassed  <dig> scaffolds with a total length of  <dig>  mb encoding  <dig>  genes. approximately 98 % of highly conserved protein-coding genes were estimated by cegma  <cit>  to be represented in all three assemblies, highlighting their comprehensiveness in core regions, and as compared to other fusarium reference assemblies which had similarly high percentages . the majority of proteins from all three genomes were functionally annotated based on comparisons to publicly available databases pfam, interpro and kegg .table  <dig> genome assembly characteristics and comparisons across fusarium species

the most in-depth studied genome of an f. oxysporum ff. spp. to date belongs to fol, which was assembled into near-complete chromosome sequences via an optical map  <cit> . we therefore used fol as our primary point of reference for subsequent comparative genomics. in some analyses we have also made additional comparisons to the similarly high-quality chromosome assembly of f. solani  <cit>  which is a more distantly related species but shares some legume hosts with the novel isolates presented here. the main protein features of fom-5190a, fop- <dig> and foc-38- <dig> are compared in table  <dig> with those of other fusarium species which shows that fom-5190a and foc-38- <dig> had similar gene numbers despite their differing assembly sizes , which appear to be influenced mostly by repetitive dna content . the number of small secreted proteins , indicative of putative roles as effectors, across the legume-infecting ff. spp. was comparable to those predicted in the two other f. oxysporum ff. spp. genomes analysed , using the criteria of protein length ≤  <dig> amino acid, predicted to be secreted and containing ≤ one transmembrane domain in the n-terminal region.table  <dig> protein set comparisons across fusarium species

to expand our analysis and aid identification of proteins common to the legume-infecting ff. spp., we next conducted protein orthology comparisons across  <dig> diverse fungal species  both closely and distantly related but sharing similar hosts . this analysis identified  <dig> paralog groups unique to foc-38- <dig>   <dig> in fop- <dig> and  <dig> unique to fom-5190a  . those genes that do not have orthologs in another ff. spp. are presumed likely to encode proteins that play a role in host specificity, and were used in subsequent analyses predicting effectors. however, host specificity may also be governed by small differences in orthologous proteins that may affect their interaction with host protein. there were  <dig>  ortholog groups shared by the legume-infecting ff. spp.  of which  <dig> were also shared with the legume pathogen f. solani. a similar number of f. solani sequences  was observed to be conserved within three distinct species of the genus fusarium  suggesting that this corresponds roughly to the number of core genes conserved amongst fusarium species.

we next examined g:c content in the new genomes as g:c variation in other fungal phytopathogens has highlighted key pathogenicity regions. for example, leptosphaeria maculans  has at-rich isochores throughout its core genome  <cit> , while z. tritici  possesses at-rich cdcs  <cit> . however we found that g:c content across the legume-infecting ff. spp. scaffolds, as well across chromosomes of the fol reference, were relatively constant at ~46–48 % with, in general, no large regions of atypical g:c %  observed, even within fol cdcs. there were however small local variations on cdcs around transposons and other repeated sequences, resulting in a marginally lower chromosome average g:c% for core versus dispensable scaffolds of fol and f. solani which was also observed for predicted dispensable versus core scaffolds from the legume-infecting ff. spp. .

next a comparison of repetitive dna content across fusarium spp. was conducted as it is an important feature in many fungal genomes, driving evolution through repeat induced point mutation, gene duplication or altering gene expression through insertion into or near other genes . prediction of repetitive dna in assemblies that primarily use short-read next-generation sequencing data, such as the recently assembled fusarium spp. genomes, is generally underestimated compared to their sanger-based counterparts  due to the presence of repeats in unassembled sequences. consequently the de novo predicted repeat content of the novel foc-38- <dig>  fop- <dig> and fom-5190a genomes was considerably lower than that of fol  although, the repeat content of other f. oxysporum ff. spp. sequenced and assembled using similar methods and analysed via this method were found to be within similar ranges .

in fol cdcs, dna transposons were over-represented and ma et al.  speculate that their expansion in fol may correlate with the formation of the fol lineage-specific regions as well as segmental duplications of some regions of the genome  <cit> . additionally, the predicted effector genes of fol, and the f. solani and f. oxysporum f. sp. betae pea pathogenicity  clusters have been observed to reside within genomic subregions enriched with dna transposons  <cit> . to aid localisation of pathogenicity-associated gene content, we therefore scanned the legume-infecting f. oxysporum ff. spp. genomes for transposable elements . the foc-38- <dig> and fop- <dig> assemblies contained a larger number of dna transposons and retrotransposons than fom-5190a , with the majority of predicted tes in all three belonging to the tc1-mariner superfamily of dna transposons which includes the impala family  <cit> . remnants of impala and fot <dig> transposons have been observed to occur in the vicinity of several fol six effector genes  <cit>  and have been used to predict new effector-like genes in fol and f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis  <cit> .

known conditionally dispensable chromosomes in fusarium spp. exhibit varying sequence conservation across legume-infecting isolates and other fusarium spp.
cdcs of fol are thought in part to define host range, are enriched for effectors and can be transferred to non-pathogenic species to confer pathogenicity  <cit> . we therefore aimed to isolate lineage specific gene content in the legume-infecting isolates by identifying their potential cdc sequences. to do this we aligned their scaffold sequences to the non-repetitive regions of chromosomes of fol and f. solani in which cdcs are well defined  <cit> , as well as those of other publicly available fusarium spp. to compare the levels of conservation. the chromosome sequences of fol  <cit>  and f. solani  <cit>  were masked based on the presence of de novo-predicted repetitive dna sequences and then translated and aligned to the repeat-masked genomes of other fusarium spp. using mummer  <cit> . a distinct pattern of variation in levels of sequence conservation between core and dispensable chromosomes was observed across f. oxysporum ff. spp. and other fusarium spp. . similar patterns were also observed for f. solani chromosomes . the percentage length of each fol and f. solani chromosome  that was covered by one or more matches is summarised in additional file 10a and b.fig.  <dig>

presence-absence variation relative to chromosomes of fol indicated a distinctive pattern of widespread absence of sequences homeologous to fol cdcs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> across fusarium spp. as previously described  <cit> . these fol cdcs are distinct from core chromosomes in having markedly higher repetitive dna content . for the legume-infecting isolates an average of ~93 % sequence conservation to the masked fol core scaffolds was observed but only ~25 % for the cdcs . partial conservation of the non-repetitive sequences of fol pathogenicity cdc  <dig>  was observed in foc-38- <dig> and fom-5190a, as well as the arabidopsis- and melon-infecting isolates fo <dig> and fom- <dig> respectively, however similar levels of conservation were not observed in fop- <dig> or across other publicly-available f. oxysporum ff. spp. genomes . this observation is interesting as most cdcs were initially thought to lack homology or synteny to related species  <cit> , although consistent with the finding that fo <dig> shared an average of  <dig>  % of the total sequence of the fol cdcs  and that six genes originally thought to be unique to fol have been identified in several other ff. spp. . the fact that foc-38- <dig> and fom-5190a show greater sequence conservation of fol cdc  <dig>  than fop- <dig> which shares only 20 % non-repetitive sequence indicates that legume infecting ff. spp. may not derive their pathogenicity from common sequences conserved with fol. the length of conserved sequence with fol pathogenicity cdc  <dig> was also low in several other f. oxysporum ff. spp. including unsurprisingly the non-pathogenic biocontrol species  as well as pathogens of other plant species . although conservation as high as 88 % was observed in another tomato-infecting isolate and 45–50 % in f. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans and f. oxysporum f. sp. raphani. similar patterns of variation in conservation across ff. spp. were also observed for other fol cdcs in isolates included in this study .

we postulated that pathogenicity on legumes may be due to conserved cd sequences within the legume-infecting ff. spp. and possibly shared with the legume pathogen f. solani. a presence-absence variation analysis relative to f. solani chromosomes found distinct absences across fusarium spp. for known cdcs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> - all of which have distinctively high repetitive content relative to core chromosomes . genes important for f. solani pathogenicity on legumes are known to be encoded on cdc  <dig> which is proposed to have been acquired via horizontal transfer  <cit> . this includes the pep cluster identified in f. solani mating population iv  <cit> . several genes from this cluster are thought to have been transferred to f. oxysporum f. sp. pisi  <cit> , with orthologs of four genes demonstrated to contribute to virulence on pea identified in this f. sp. . yet the non-repetitive sequence of f. solani cdc  <dig> shared only 17 % sequence conservation with fop- <dig>  16 % with fom-5190a, and 21 % with foc-38- <dig>  with similar values also observed in the non-legume pathogens fo <dig>  and fom- <dig> . therefore f. solani appears not to be the common origin for legume-infecting ff. spp. pathogenicity content, although we did identify orthologs of some pep genes with known roles in virulence as discussed in later sections.

phylogenetic and orthology analysis indicates independent origins of legume host- specificity
one possible explanation for the evolution of legume-host specificity in f. oxysporum isolates is a common ancestor shared by only legume-infecting ff. spp., however this was not supported by a phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> randomly selected orthologous genes across fusarium spp. . thus legume-pathogenicity appears to have arisen more than once within this species. another possibility is that the legume-infecting ff. spp. may share a set of similar proteins governing legume-host pathogenicity, arrived at via either lateral gene transfer or convergent evolution. however, based on the orthology analysis, only one protein was common to just the four legume-infecting fusarium species and the encoding gene was not detected as expressed under the in planta conditions examined in the following sections .

comparative analysis of predicted core and dispensable sequences in legume-infecting isolates and their gene content with other f. oxysporum ff. spp.
drawing upon sequence comparisons to core chromosomes and experimentally demonstrated cdcs of fol and f. solani  <cit> , scaffolds from fom-5190a, fop- <dig> and foc-38- <dig> were predicted as either “core” or putatively “dispensable” . scaffolds with unique matches across more than 30 % of their length to core chromosomes in fol or f. solani were designated “core” scaffolds, whilst those with no match, or that matched to a cdc in either genome, were designated as potentially “dispensable”. in general we observed that the newly predicted conditionally dispensable sequences of the legume-infecting ff. spp. shared known characteristics of fusarium cdcs. they had increased repetitive content, reduced gene density, smaller average size of predicted proteins relative to those encoded on core scaffolds and a slightly lower average g:c% . the predicted dispensable scaffolds were also more numerous and shorter in average length than those scaffolds predicted to form part of core chromosomes , presumably due the influence of repetitive sequence on the assembly of those genomic regions.table  <dig> properties of scaffolds predicted to form part of either core or dispensable chromosomes in legume-infecting formae speciales




in order to facilitate the search for genomic regions with roles in plant pathogenicity we compared the sequences of predicted dispensable scaffolds from the legume-infecting ff. spp. with cdcs of fol and f. solani or other f. oxysporum ff. spp. to identify those with high conservation levels. a comparison between the predicted cd sequences of fom-5190a and foc-38- <dig> revealed that although the total size difference between the predicted dispensable regions was  <dig>  mb , the length of conserved non-repetitive sequence between these isolates was very similar . we speculate that increased repetitive content in the predicted foc-38- <dig> dispensome is reflective of and potentially accounts for its overall increased assembly length. interestingly, in contrast to the phylogenetic studies based on genes encoded on “core” scaffolds , after masking repetitive and low complexity sequences foc-38- <dig>  fop- <dig> and fom-5190a predicted dispensable scaffolds shared highest sequence conservation with the brassica-infecting isolate fo <dig> , closely followed by the melon-infecting f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis  and the other legume-infecting isolates. the masked predicted dispensable scaffolds of foc-38- <dig> and fom-5190a share a greater length of conserved sequence with the pea-infecting isolate fop- <dig> than with each other . no long runs of consecutive conserved genes between the ff. spp. were observed in predicted dispensable sequences although this may be due to the fragmented assembly of these repeat-rich genomic regions. these data suggest that the legume-infecting ff. spp. may not have acquired and retained whole chromosome sized segments of cd content specific to pathogenicity on legume hosts. they may however, share smaller conserved segments.table  <dig> summary of sequence conservation between fom-5190a and foc-38- <dig> predicted dispensable scaffolds and other fusarium species

amasked sequences exclude repetitive regions



as cdcs from fusarium spp. are known to be enriched for pathogenicity-associated genes , but lack ‘housekeeping’ genes  <cit> , we next compared the gene content and assigned functions of genes encoded on the predicted dispensable scaffolds with that of predicted core scaffolds. a larger proportion of the proteins encoded on scaffolds assigned as dispensable had no known function based on pfam annotation . over half of the manually-curated non-te orfs from fol cdc  <dig> also have no known function  <cit> , highlighting one of the main obstacles in assigning biological roles to potential pathogenicity genes due to the lack of conserved domains identified in most fungal effectors, which thus require experimental evaluation. for genes assigned functional annotation based on comparisons to the pfam database  <cit> , most functional groups enriched on predicted dispensable scaffolds were similar to those observed on fol cdcs  <cit>  . these included: major facilitator superfamily  transporters, transcriptional regulators, sugar transporters, methyl transferases, chitin-binding domains , p450s, het domains , nacht domains , and carbohydrate-active enzymes   <cit> ) as well as several peptidases. additionally in foc-38- <dig> and fop- <dig> an enrichment of te related orfs were observed relative to predicted core scaffolds, including those with domains related to reverse transcription, transposition, dna binding and dimerisation , which is consistent with their elevated repeat content relative to fom-5190a.

expression of predicted-cd sequence-encoded genes in fom-5190a with conservation across legume-infecting f. oxysporum ff. spp.
in order to further narrow in on predicted cd scaffold gene content with potential roles in pathogenicity that may be conserved within the legume-infecting ff. spp., we used our model fom-5190a legume pathosystem to identify genes expressed during an early stage of infection. from rna sequencing of three pooled biological replicates of infected m. truncatula roots at 2 days post inoculation  we found that for each replicate  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the reads mapped to the fom-5190a assembly respectively, giving combined support for the expression of  <dig> genes . due to the early time-point and the low fungal biomass at this stage of infection, only  <dig> genes had 100 % coverage of the predicted gene model with rna-seq reads, with  <dig> genes having 50 % or more coverage, and the remaining overlapped by one or more reads. of the  <dig> genes with expression data,  <dig> genes were encoded on predicted fom-5190a dispensable chromosomes.

comparison of predicted fom-5190a dispensable scaffolds that shared greater than 40 % sequence identity with the pea pathogen f. solani identified  <dig> scaffolds encoding  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which were expressed by fom-5190a at  <dig> dpi. these included genes with potential roles in pathogenicity such as cytochrome p450s, glycoside hydrolases , peptidases, a sodium/hydrogen-exchanger family protein, and fungal transcription factors.

the same comparison between fom-5190a dispensable scaffolds and foc-38- <dig> identified  <dig> genes expressed at  <dig> dpi. this included several small clusters of 3– <dig> genes expressed in planta, on scaffold  <dig> , scaffold  <dig>  and a cluster of ‘restless-like’ transposons on scaffold  <dig>  tes have been previously observed to be active in several f. oxysporum genomes  <cit> , and many in fom-5190a were also found to be transcribed during infection. this indicates they are still active and may be involved in the rearrangement of the genome. the genes encoded on scaffold  <dig> and the smaller gene clusters predominantly encoded proteins of unknown function but also included fungal transcription factors, proteases, peptidases, and mfs and abc transporters. fom-5190a scaffold  <dig> is ~380 kb in length, encodes  <dig> genes and many of those detected as expressed in planta  have possible associations with pathogenicity, including pectate lyases, mfs transporters, peptidases, cytochrome p-450 s, and components of the f. solani pep cluster   <cit> . however, this scaffold shares only 23 % sequence conservation with f. solani, indicating that there has not been a large scale transfer of the cdc, or that if there was, this region of the fom-5190a genome has since undergone significant reshuffling. fom-5190a scaffold  <dig> does however share  <dig>  % sequence similarity with foc-38- <dig> and  <dig>  % with fop- <dig>  suggesting that these sequences may share a similar source. this scaffold also shares 87 % sequence conservation with fo <dig> and f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis, but only  <dig>  % with fol. the source and route of transfer amongst f. oxysporum ff. spp. of the cdc that this scaffold is thought to represent, may become apparent with further comparative studies enabled by the growing number of available fusarium genomes.

finally, a comparison between fom-5190a predicted dispensable scaffolds and fop- <dig> identified two scaffolds with high sequence similarity. firstly, fom-5190a scaffold  <dig> shared more than 183 kb  with fop- <dig>  this scaffold encodes  <dig> genes including several mfs transporters, a cytochrome p <dig> and several fungal transcription factors. twelve of these genes were expressed at  <dig> dpi, with three predicted to be secreted, and four consecutively encoded  including those with similarity to a fad dependent oxidoreductase, a protein-arginine deiminase and an mfs transporter as well as a nearby encoded isochorismatate hydrolase. this scaffold also shares over 86 % homology with f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis and fo <dig> but not foc-38- <dig>  f. solani or fol, suggesting it hasn’t been derived from a common legume-infecting isolate. another fom-5190a scaffold, scaffold  <dig>  shares high sequence conservation with only fop- <dig>  and encodes  <dig> genes  all of which were expressed in planta at  <dig> dpi including a fungal transcription factor, an abc transporter, a monoxygenase  and a glutathione s-transferase. four of these genes  are also co-linear with fop- <dig> genes . the properties of these genes: location on predicted cd sequences, expression early in infection and conserved synteny, collectively suggests important roles in the infection process and thus these genes will be prioritised for follow up in future functional studies.

as orthologs or possible components of the f. solani pep cluster were identified several times in the above analysis, we investigated this cluster in further detail. legumes are known to produce low molecular weight antimicrobial compounds, known as phytoalexins including maackiain in chickpea, pisatin in pea, and medicarpin in medicago sp.  <cit> . these pterocarpan molecules are structurally similar and are toxic to several genera of fungi and legume pathogens with the ability to detoxify or export these compounds are more virulent . in the pea pathogens fop and f. solani the phytoalexin pisatin is demethylated by a cytochrome p <dig> known as pisatin demethylase  shown to be important for virulence on this host  <cit>  and demonstrated to be able to detoxify pisatin in isolation  <cit> . in f. solani the pep cluster of genes containing pda <dig> is found in the reference mating population on cdc  <dig> and exhibits altered codon usage compared to core genes  <cit> . the cluster contains six genes in f. solani, four of which have demonstrated roles in virulence   <cit> , all of which are induced in response to pisatin and during infection of pea  <cit>  and function independently as virulence factors  <cit> . apart from pda <dig> only two have proposed biological functions pep <dig> is a potential mfs and pep <dig> possibly has a role in rna binding  <cit> . our analysis showed that none of the legume infecting f. oxysporum ff. spp. contained the pep cluster in its entirety. fop- <dig> has two copies of pep <dig> , whilst foc-38- <dig> has one  and fom-5190a has none. genes similar to pep <dig> and containing mfs domains  were found in fop , foc-38- <dig> , and fom-5190a  where foxm_5190a_ <dig> was next to a f. solani pda <dig> ortholog. we identified two orthologs of pda <dig> in foc-38- <dig> and four in fom-5190a, three of which were detected as expressed in planta . several of these orthologs had greater homology to f. solani pdas, while the others were closer to pda genes from fop. previous analyses of f. oxysporum f. sp. pisi isolates showed that while homologs of genes from the f. solani pep cluster are often present amongst isolates of the different fop races, their location can differ across races and they are rarely identified as a cluster  <cit> , supporting the idea of multiple origins for fop races unrelated to pda gene content  <cit> . these studies also show that orthologs of pda <dig> are present within a group of related ff. spp. that are pathogenic on dicots  although the encoded proteins are not always functional due to small but important amino acid changes  <cit> . a functional homolog, demonstrated to be more closely related to fop pda <dig> than f. solani pda <dig>  was identified in f. sp. phaesoli  which was also virulent on pea and that the authors suggest may have arisen via hgt  <cit> . another possible explanation proposed in a recent study  <cit>  is that pda <dig> is vertically inherited within the fosc, rather than via hgt from f. solani as previously proposed  <cit> .

the f. solani pep cluster also contains nht <dig> transposons  <cit> , however none were found in the genome assemblies of foc-38- <dig>  fom-5190a or fop- <dig>  another possible indicator of the separate evolution of these genes in these ff. spp. from a common ancestor rather than transfer of a whole region. it is possible that some of the genes characterised as pdas are detoxifying pterocarpans other than pisatin, such as medicarpin or sativan which are produced by both alfalfa and m. truncatula. however further investigation including biochemical examination of the breakdown products of these fungal enzymes will be required to determine this.

prediction of effector genes in fom-5190a– pathogen of the model legume medicago truncatula
like many other plant pathogens, fusarium spp. are known to produce small secreted proteins and secondary metabolites to manipulate and evade their host plant’s defences  <cit> . in addition to identification of proteins with known roles in plant pathogenicity in other fungal species  a combination of multiple sources of evidence was used to predict putative legume host-specific effectors. this incorporated predictions of secretion and protein size, orthology across fusarium spp. and orthology-based lineage-specificity, functional annotations, predictions of dispensable sequences, proximity to pathogenicity gene-associated repetitive dna, and rna-seq data derived from our model legume pathosystem.

we identified  <dig> ssps in fom-5190a, and  <dig> and  <dig> respectively in foc-38- <dig> and fop- <dig> . this number is comparable to that predicted in other fusarium oxysporum ff. spp. and fusarium spp. . in fom-5190a,  <dig> ssps were predicted to occur on potentially dispensable scaffolds, with  <dig> and  <dig> respectively found in foc-38- <dig> and fop- <dig>  rna-seq data from infected m. truncatula roots showed that  <dig> of these ssps were expressed at  <dig> dpi. this included four homologs of the fol secreted in xylem  genes, with proposed roles in virulence/avirulence on tomato . of these  <dig> proteins, only five had characterised pfam domains including a gh <dig>  cfem and lysm, a peroxidase and a duf <dig> domain .table  <dig> properties of fom-5190a effector candidates

further manual inspection of the annotation and level of rna-seq expression of the  <dig> ssps encoded on fom-5190a dispensable scaffolds identified a subset of  <dig> genes that were prioritised for further initial investigation as effector candidates  . protein orthology analysis supported only one of these proteins  as lineage-specific to fom-5190a with the others sharing best blastp matches of 42–99 % similarity to other f. oxysporum or f. fujikuroi proteins . of the six homologs, foxm_5190a_six <dig> was most similar to that identified in fop- <dig>  and the foxm-5190a_six <dig> best blastp match was foc-38_six <dig>  differing by only one amino acid  suggesting that these genes, in particular six <dig>  may have a common origin. fom-5190a six <dig> and six <dig> homologs shared less conservation to legume pathogenic ff. spp., with best matches to fol  and f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis  respectively. two other effector candidates foxm_5190a_ <dig> and foxm_5190a_ <dig>  which contain no characterised domains, were also most similar to proteins from legume-infecting ff. spp., fop- <dig>  or foc-38- <dig>  respectively. while these ten effector candidates constitute a shortlist for further investigation, the overall fom-5190a pathogenicity gene set may be much larger with  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted ssps detected as expressed in planta at  <dig> dpi.

because our analysis highlighted the potential importance of six gene homologs during fom-5190a infection we searched for these proteins in the other f. oxysporum ff. spp. and sp. . we identified several homologs of fol six genes in all the legume-infecting ff. spp. the foc-38- <dig> assembly contained homologs of six <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  whilst fop- <dig> contained six <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . all of the six homologs were encoded on scaffolds predicted to be dispensable except foc-38-1_six <dig> which is encoded on a scaffold with similarity to fol core chromosome  <dig>  there are many six <dig> genes in fol but none occur on core chromosome  <dig>   <cit> . while it is possible the foc-38-1-six <dig> -encoding genomic region was mis-assembled, self-alignment of illumina generated genomic read data supports the current assembly. there is the potential for transposon-mediated translocation of genes from dispensable regions into the core genome to have occurred. thus it may be that the location of this gene has been shuffled in foc-38- <dig>  facilitated by the adjacent mimps and other tes .table  <dig>

fop- <dig> contained annotated homologs of six <dig>  and matches by tblastn to unannotated versions of six <dig> and six <dig> which were manually annotated for this study  and six <dig> where the coding sequence was interrupted by stop codons



interestingly, only six <dig> was found in all the legume infecting ff. spp. and this six gene is the only one in fol  not found on cdc  <dig>  but instead on cdc  <dig>  <cit> . as orthologs of this protein were also detected in ff. spp. infecting melons and banana it appears unlikely to have a role in legume host-specificity but may play a role in pathogenicity. we also observed six gene homologs in two other fusarium species, f. verticilloides  and f. fujikuroi   <cit>  . the presence of six genes outside the species f. oxysporum has previously been observed in f. verticilloides   <cit>  and f. foetens   <cit> . six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig> and six <dig> homologs were identified in at least  <dig> out of the 7 f. oxysporum species analysed in table  <dig>  suggesting these proteins may play conserved roles in pathogenicity but not host-specificity, unless small amino acid changes govern their interaction with host proteins. top blastp matches for six protein homologs in foc-38- <dig> and fop- <dig> show that six <dig> is highly conserved between fom-5190a and foc-38- <dig>  six <dig> between all three legume-infecting ff. spp. and six <dig> between pea- and chickpea-infecting isolates . phylogenetic relationships between the six genes encoded by fom-5190a that were also present in other ff. spp.  suggests that the relationship between proteins encoded on predicted dispensable scaffolds differs from that of the conserved core proteins . this is not unexpected if dispensable genomic regions are indeed readily exchanged amongst different isolates  <cit> , whilst core regions remain relatively stable or if gene content of dispensable regions is undergoing more frequent mutation and rearrangement facilitated by repetitive elements. this finding is supported by a recent study  <cit>  that showed incongruent phylogenies between six genes  and the house-keeping gene ef-1α and additionally presented evidence of potential vertical transmission of six <dig> between related isolates. it is most likely that the six genes have a common ancestry either laterally or vertically and we can speculate that minor sequence differences contributing to their alternate phylogeny may be the result of host-driven selection.

a recent study examining the landscape of the fol pathogenicity chromosomes identified small clusters of six genes which were associated with a class of dna transposons known as mites   <cit> . these mites, include an upstream  incomplete fragment of the impala transposon sequence   <cit>  and often an additional downstream miniature fot <dig> transposon   <cit> . their presence in gene-flanking sequences has also been used as a criterion to support the prediction of effector genes in ff. spp. infecting tomato and melons  <cit> . we therefore searched for the presence of these tes or their inverted repeats around the predicted legume-infecting ff. spp. six genes and effector candidates. the six <dig> homolog residing on fom-5190a scaffold  <dig> is flanked by a partial impala 430 bp upstream. in the foc-38- <dig> assembly several six gene homologs had matches to mimps upstream , and six <dig> was flanked by a downstream complete fot <dig> transposase which may facilitate movement of this gene. in the case of foc-38-1_six <dig> and the fom-5190a six genes where mimps were not identified upstream, the six gene homologs resided on short-length scaffolds with little surrounding sequence assembled, inhibiting the search for upstream or flanking intergenic sequences. in fop- <dig> upstream mimps were only identified close to six <dig> , six <dig> and six <dig> although the region upstream of fop- <dig> six <dig> had undefined sequence hampering identification of a possible mimp.

qrt-pcr validation of fom-5190a effector candidates during host infection
to validate our rnaseq data and determine expression of the ten shortlisted effector candidates over a longer period of infection, we examined via qrt-pcr their expression in vitro and over a 1– <dig> day in planta time-course in susceptible m. truncatula plants . by  <dig> dpi, most infected plants had visible wilting symptoms and the majority of infected plants were killed by  <dig> dpi . increasing fungal biomass over the course of infection was indicated by an increase in the amount of fungal its relative to plant its detected via qrt-pcr as the infection progressed .fig.  <dig> expression of candidate pathogenicity genes in vitro versus in planta. a expression of six genes and b candidate pathogenicity genes as determined by qrt-pcr in in vitro samples and m. truncatula dza <dig> root samples harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 7 days post inoculation  with fom-5190a. in vitro samples are averages ± se of  <dig> biological replicates. in planta samples are averages ± se of  <dig> biological replicates each consisting of pools of  <dig> seedlings. gene expression levels are relative to the fungal actin gene . note: ^ no detectable expression in  <dig> or  <dig> out of the  <dig> in vitro replicates



many fungal effector proteins are only expressed in planta and cannot be detected in vitro, or if so, at very low levels  <cit>  . all of the fom-5190a six gene homologs were expressed in planta and showed lower or no expression in vitro, exhibiting a pattern of increased expression over the course of the infection , peaking at  <dig> dpi with fold-inductions over in vitro ranging from  <dig> to over  <dig> . the other six predicted effector genes prioritised for initial follow up studies in fom-5190a shared this expression pattern, albeit to various levels of induction . after foxm-5190a-six <dig>  foxm-5190a- <dig> and foxm-5190a- <dig> showed the largest fold-inductions in expression in planta versus in vitro, and both of their encoded proteins exhibited similar levels of identity across several f. oxysporum ff. spp. . the fom_5190a lineage specific gene foxm_5190a_ <dig>  showed strong expression in planta increasing over the course of infection but no or very little expression in vitro. this protein had an upstream mimp and no similarity to any proteins in the non-redundant database at ncbi  making it a strong candidate for a host specific effector. however a hidden markov model analysis identified a  <dig> aa region within the  <dig> aa protein sharing 58 % identity to a region from a hypothetical colletotrichum orbiculare maff  <dig> protein  and other pathogenic fungi from the ascomycota such as pseudocercospora fijiensis, claviceps purpurea and sphaerulina musiva. an iterative search  <cit>  of these sequences for distinct regions of similarity identified a motif resembling a zinc finger domain, suggesting foxm-5190a_ <dig> may target host dna sequences. the hypothetical foxm_5190a_ <dig> protein which shares 99 % amino acid identity to foc38_ <dig> had 27-fold up-regulated expression by  <dig> dpi, compared to in vitro, and showed a slight further increase in expression over the sampled time-course. another candidate, foxm_5190a_ <dig>  whose product shares 95 % aa identity with a fop_ <dig> protein  encodes a lysm domain and has some similarity to ecp <dig> - a small, cysteine-rich, secreted effector protein identified in cladosporium fulvum  of unknown function  <cit>  - which has homologs in several fungal species. this protein is an ortholog of a recently identified f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis candidate effector , which has an upstream mimp and shares a promoter with another candidate effector  <cit> . however in fom- <dig> the lack of upstream assembled sequence meant we were unable to identify a mimp or potentially co-regulated gene. these genes and the others identified from the rna expression analysis have been prioritised for further investigation of their roles in pathogenicity and host specificity.

CONCLUSIONS
the addition of the genomic sequences of the legume-infecting f. oxysporum ff. spp. presented here adds to the accumulated bioinformatics resources for fusarium oxysporum formae speciales and helps provide a powerful knowledge-base for predicting lineage-specific genes involved in host-specific pathogenicity. analysis of pathogenicity-related cdc gene content conserved amongst the legume-infecting fusarium oxysporum ff. spp. identified several fom-5190a scaffolds enriched in genes with known or potential roles in pathogenicity, in particular carbohydrate active enzymes, cytochrome p450s, mfs and abc transporters, fungal transcription factors as well as newly predicted effectors. while the source of these conserved gene sequences is yet to be elucidated, it is evident that parts of the potential dispensable chromosomes greater than just the repetitive regions are shuffled around within the genome of each f. sp., with those changes at least in fom-5190a possibly associated with active transposable elements. as transposons can be a major source of genetic recombination in an asexual species, this may have contributed to the increased assembly size of foc-38- <dig> and potentially the evolution of a large number of races in this f. sp.. interestingly, the predicted dispensable scaffolds in foc-38- <dig> and fom-5190a shared more identity with fop- <dig> than with each other, and little with another legume-infecting fusarium species . they also shared to a similar degree, cdc content with ff. spp. that are pathogenic on non-legume plant species including arabidopsis and melon, but not with fol.

combining this observation with the differing presence of six gene homologs across these ff. spp., points towards different sources for their origins of pathogenicity and suggests that pathogenicity on legumes is a complex phenotype. it is apparent that legume-pathogenicity is not simply governed by a small set of conserved genes retained from an ancestral species that are specific to legume-infecting isolates. it is possible, though unlikely based on our analyses, that the respective legume host-specific pathogenicity genes of the three legume-infecting ff. spp. may have the same origin but have since diverged significantly. previous studies have shown that there can be multiple origins for pathogenicity on a given host within a f. oxysporum f. sp. and individual isolates phenotypically classified as a particular f. sp. can be more closely related to isolates belonging to a different f. sp.  <cit> . we speculate that the origin of legume host-specific pathogenicity is not likely to have arisen from recent horizontal transfer events, as this would have resulted in greater sequence similarities than we observed. whether the pathogenicity components were transferred as a whole chromosome from other f. oxysporum ff. spp. and subsequently reshuffled, mutated or partially lost remains to be elucidated, but will perhaps be revealed with the sequencing of additional legume-infecting ff. spp. and races.

for the model legume-infecting f. sp. fom-5190a, we shortlisted a set of candidate effectors four of which showed greatest similarity to proteins from another legume pathogenic ff. spp., suggestive of a conserved role in legume pathogenicity. initial verification via expression analysis of these candidates supports this approach and lays the framework that will facilitate functional characterisation of these candidates in subsequent studies, for the ultimate application of this knowledge towards the development of fusarium wilt resistance in economically important legume crops.
