BACKGROUND
first described in  <dig>  parachlamydia acanthamoebae is an obligate intracellular bacterium naturally infecting free-living amoebae  <cit> . it was isolated from acanthamoeba spp. recovered from the nasal mucosa of healthy volunteers  <cit> . later, additional strains of parachlamydiaceae have been found within about 5% of acanthamoeba spp. and once within hartmanella vermiformis  <cit> . the 16s rrna sequences of these parachlamydiaceae are about 14% different from those of both genera chlamydophila and chlamydia  <cit> . since the 16s rrna sequence difference between chlamydophila sp. and chlamydia sp. is 6% only, it clearly appears that the speciation between the two latter occurred after the divergence between parachlamydiaceae and chlamydiaceae.

like other chlamydiales, parachlamydiaceae can present two developmental stages: the reticulate body, a metabolically active dividing form, and the elementary body, an infective stage; the crescent body is another infective form, not observed in chlamydiaceae  <cit> . differentiation of the infective stages in reticulate bodies and multiplication of the latter were recently shown to occur within amoebal vacuoles, that may contain hundreds of bacteria  <cit> . depending on the symbiotic/pathogenic relationships prevailing between both organisms, the escape of the bacteria from the amoeba may occur either by the release of secreted vesicles or by the lysis of the host  <cit> .

there is a growing evidence of the human pathogenicity of parachlamydiaceae  <cit> . for instance, positive parachlamydia serologies were shown to be associated with a febrile epidemic  <cit> , community-acquired pneumonia  <cit> , and inhalation pneumonia  <cit> . the role of parachlamydia-related bacteria as agents of inhalation pneumonia is further suggested by the temperature-dependent release of the bacteria from their amoebal reservoir  <cit> . pcr amplification of parachlamydial dna from monocytes, sputa and bronchoalveolar lavages collected from patients suffering of bronchitis or pneumonia also supports the pathogenic potential of parachlamydia  <cit> . the survival of these chlamydia-like organisms within human macrophages  <cit>  is an additional hint of parachlamydial pathogenicity.

horn et al.  <cit> , by sequencing and annotating the whole genome of the parachlamydia-related uwe <dig> contributed much to the understanding of the evolution of chlamydiae. indeed, they demonstrated that major virulence mechanisms of chlamydiaceae such as the type three secretion system  and the chlamydial protease-like activity factor  are also encoded by the chromosome of the evolutionary early-branching parachlamydiaceae uwe <dig>  genome analysis of the parachlamydial endosymbiont also identified open reading frames  homologous to type four secretion systems  and characterized by a high g+c content, suggesting that they result from an horizontal transfer. based on their annotation revealing the apparent absence of genes necessary for dna transfer, horn et al.  <cit>  proposed that this tfss was involved in protein export but not in dna transfer.

to date, numerous genomic islands  were already identified along whole chromosomal sequences of various bacterial species. for instance,  <dig> gis are described in the islander database, including gis of proteobacteria, firmicutes, actinobacteria and cyanobacteria  <cit> . thus, we wondered whether any gis were located along the bacterial chromosome of the amoebal endosymbiont uwe <dig> 

gis are genetic elements which length vary from  <dig> to  <dig> kb and are inserted in a chromosome after a lateral transfer occurring, in some instances, between phylogenetically-distant microorganisms. their heterologous origins are generally evidenced by a g+c content different from that of the remaining bacterial chromosome and by the presence of various mobility genes , that are occasionally source of gi instability  <cit> . they are often flanked by particular dna sequences, such as direct repeats or insertion sequences. moreover, trna loci are generally used as insertion sites by gis for their chromosomal integration  <cit> . since no genetic tools are available for the study of this obligate intracellular bacteria, a bioinformatic approach was chosen to locate putative gis.

RESULTS
a genomic island is present in the genome of uwe25
using standard g+c content analyses of parachlamydia-related uwe <dig> chromosome, we observed a g+c-rich region , similar to that shown by horn et al.  <cit> . using the residual cumulative g+c content analysis adapted from the gc profile of zhang and zhang  <cit> , we were able to precisely define a 19-kb region . the presence of 17-bp direct repeats flanking a 100-kb chromosome region  that encompasses the 19-kb dna sequence enabled us to define a new region composed of  <dig> orfs . interestingly, this 100-kb region is characterized by a higher level of local gene coorientation  than that characterizing the remaining of the genome  and by a particular signature in the cumulative gc skew analysis. two identical gly-trna genes in tandem are located at the proximal end of this 100-kb genetic element . several mobility genes  are encoded within the 100-kb region . thus, this region largely fulfills the accepted criteria of gis  <cit> . we termed this newly described gi "pam100g"  according to the nomenclature used in the islander database  <cit> .

mosaicism of the 100-kb genomic island
 interestingly, this gi can be divided into clearly distinct regions, according to their g+c content . the residual cumulative g+c content analysis highlights a modular structure with different slopes, each   linear segment indicates that genes of this unit present a rather constant local g+c content . a positive or a negative slope would indicate that   each block of genes presents a g+c content higher or lower that of the uwe <dig> chromosome, respectively. 

the first module begins with a direct repeat and two identical gly-trnas in tandem. composed of  <dig> orfs, this unit exhibits a g+c content  similar to that of the remaining of the genome of uwe <dig> . sixteen homologs to these  <dig> genes  were found in databases,  <dig> of them  exhibiting a best score in blast analyses with a chlamydiaceae orf . interestingly, no gene of the other modules of the 100-kb gi exhibited a best hit in similarity analyses with any chlamydiaceae counterpart. some of the genes present in the first module, such as sctn and sctq, are part of a ttss also present in chlamydiaceae. the other ttss genes are disseminated along the chromosome of uwe <dig>  the presence of some ttss genes in the first module and of a gene encoding a putative transposase at the distal end of the first module of this 100-kb gi suggests that this first unit was acquired by chromosomal rearrangements. .

characterized by a low g+c content , the 2nd module encodes  <dig> orfs. only five are similar to known protein sequences , four of them being identified as mobility genes .

the 3rd module , exhibiting the second highest g+c content of the uwe <dig> genome , comprises  <dig> orfs. some of these genes were identified as tra genes by horn et al.  <cit> . using blast analyses and alignment tools, we re-annotated the whole module  and, if we except two transposase genes and one orf of unknown function, we unveiled that all orfs of this module belong to a genetic unit similar to the tra operons encoding the tfss previously described in proteobacterial genomes .

presenting a low g+c content , the 4th module  is composed of  <dig> orfs. all these orfs were previously annotated by horn et al.  <cit>  as encoding hypothetical proteins or without homolog. our blast analysis identified one orf homologous to genes encoding bacteriophage-related proteins and two genes of proteins involved in dna metabolism . interestingly, a direct repeat is located between the 9th and 10th genes of the module. this 17-bp direct repeat, that presents  <dig> mismatches is similar to those present at the proximal and distal ends of the gi, exhibiting the same  <dig> conserved nucleotides. it may reflect a complex evolutionary history of the gi, possibly enabling it to be mobile as 25-kb, 75-kb or 100-kb dna segments.

a single large protein is encoded along the 5th module . its g+c content is one of the highest of the uwe <dig> chromosome . by blast analysis, this protein exhibits the strongest similarity with the human nod <dig> protein.

the 6th module  is characterized by a low g+c content . this unit is composed of  <dig> orfs, the first orf encoding a product similar to the death on cure  protein of p <dig> bacteriophage. two orfs code for proteins involved in dna metabolism and an additional orf encodes a putative transposase.

the 7th module is short  and present a g+c-rich unit . five of the six orfs of this unit encode a probable resolvase, three putative transposases and a phage-related doc protein. the final direct repeat is located at the end of this module. with the only exception of the phage-related protein, all other orfs of the 7th module appear to be similar to gamma-proteobacterial proteins, possibly explaining the observed different signal in the g+c content analysis.

role of the type iv secretion system encoded by the 100-kb genomic island
the functions of genes encoded by gis may be related, among others, to pathogenicity such as the ability to exploit the host intracellular environment. since no genetic system has been described for any obligate intracellular chlamydiae, we investigated the putative functions of this gi by bioinformatics. we focused our analyses on the tfss, for which a previous annotation of the tra genes showed a genetic unit unable to transfer dna  <cit> . using different protein comparison methods described in the additional data file  <dig>  we identified supplementary tra genes, and compared the general organization of this tra unit with other genetic elements encoding tfss genes  <cit> . the uwe <dig> tra unit displays a striking colinearity with tra operons encoding f-like conjugative dna transfer system, especially to those of the f and pnl <dig> plasmids of escherichia coli and novosphingobium aromaticivorans, respectively . all homologous genes essential for dna transfer in plasmid f  and involved in sex pilus retraction and mating pair stabilization  <cit>  are present, strongly suggesting that, similarly to the other f-like tfsss, the gene products encoded by the uwe <dig> tra unit are devoted to dna transfer. with the only exception of trag, these genes are not present on p-like and i-like plasmids, reinforcing the close relationship prevailing between the uwe <dig> tra unit and their f-like plasmids counterparts.

origin of the genomic island and of its type four secretion system
our blast analyses  <cit>  reveal that a majority  of genes not presenting a best hit for chlamydial genes but having homologs in other taxa are more related to proteobacterial genes . moreover, the blast analyses of the  <dig> orfs of the third module, encoding the tra genes, show that most orfs of this unit  are of proteobacterial origin. however, since six of them present the highest similarity to alpha-proteobacterial genes and six others to gamma-proteobacterial genes, a more precise origin of the parachlamydial tra unit could not be precisely defined by this first approach.

the presence of gly-trna at the proximal end of the gi of uwe <dig> is consistent with a close relatedness between this gi and proteobacteria: out of  <dig> gis described in the islander database of mantri et al.  <cit>  inserted along a chromosome by a gly-trna ,  <dig> of them  were sequenced in a proteobacterial genome. no gi of gram-positives described in the islander database are inserted in a chromosome within a gly-trna gene. again, a precise proteobacterial origin could not be proposed, because the distribution of gly-trna genes in alpha-  and gamma-proteobacterial  gis is not significantly different: by including only the non-redundant gis, the distribution of gly-trna genes in alpha and gamma-proteobacterial gis is 2/ <dig> and 7/ <dig>  respectively.

comparison of gene order between all tra units also failed in assigning a precise origin to the uwe <dig> tra unit since it branched near the alpha- and gamma-proteobacterial tra operons . the only first hint of a possible gamma-proteobacterial origin for the uwe <dig> tra unit was brought by the phylogenetic analyses . thus, bootstraps values of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 92% supported the node separating the concatenated tra genes of uwe <dig> and several tra operons of gamma-proteobacterial f-like plasmids from the f-plasmids of an alpha-proteobacteria and of other gamma-proteobacteria. .

discussion
we showed that the parachlamydia-related endosymbiont uwe <dig> presents a 100-kb region largely fullfilling the criteria of gis  <cit> . indeed, this dna region characterized by a high level of gene co-orientation presents a g+c content different from that of the remainder of the genome. the presence of direct repeats flanking this chromosome region enabled us to focus on  <dig> orfs. two identical gly-trna genes in tandem are present at the proximal end of this genetic element. moreover, several mobility genes encoding transposases and bacteriophage related-proteins are located within this chromosome region.

the cumulative residual g+c content analysis shows that this gi is composed of seven modules. such a chimeric organization was already described in other gis  <cit> . the first module contains chlamydiae genes probably brought by chromosome rearrangements. some of these genes, homologous to ttss genes of chlamydiaceae, might provide selective advantages to strains that retained the gi. the 2nd, 4th and 6th modules are mainly composed of bacteriophage-related protein genes, that could reflect a putative phage implication in gi formation.

the 3rd module codes for a tfss similar to tra operons. we propose that this tra unit is devoted to dna transfer, based  on similarity analyses demonstrating the presence of all genes encoding proteins used during a dna transfer,  on phylogenetic analyses of tra unit genes and,  on comparison of gene order. these analyses clearly demonstrate that the uwe <dig> tra unit is strongly more related to f-like conjugative system than to p-like and i-like secretion systems. the significant bootstraps of all trees obtained by standard gene phylogeny and their congruent topologies with others obtained by the gene order breakpoint analysis not biased by codon usage homing, strongly support the validity of these analyses confirming the f-like conjugative nature of the parachlamydial tra unit. thus, our model significantly differs from the other proposed by horn et al.  <cit> , who did not identify traa, tral, trak, trav, and concluded that the uwe <dig> tra unit is involved in protein export, and not in dna transfer.

the 5th module presents a nucleotide composition similar to the tra unit and is composed of a single high g+c 6-kb gene, whose product is similar to the human nod <dig> protein. the nod  proteins are members of a family that also includes the apoptosis regulator apaf <dig>  and plant disease-resistance gene products  <cit> . the function of the human nod <dig> is still unknown. like nod <dig> and nod <dig>  nod <dig> might be involved in the recognition of conserved motifs present at the surface of bacteria, such as peptidoglycan.

the nucleotide g+c composition of the 2nd, 4th, and 6th modules are similar, explaining the observed similar negative slope of the residual g+c curves. moreover, these three modules encode phage-related proteins and proteins involved in dna metabolism. these modules probably involved in mobility might have a common origin, the ancestral single phage module being currently separated in three pieces by the presence of the tra unit and of the nod3-like protein encoding gene.

the positive slope in the g+c analysis of the 7th module echoes those of the tra unit  and of the nod3-like protein . the 7th module encodes a transposition resolvase and three transposases similar to gamma-proteobacterial homologs. with the only exception of the phage-related doc protein, that has an homolog at the beginning of the sixth module, and that might be located there after transposition, the 7th module appears thus to have a different origin than the 2nd, 4th and 6th modules, though also encoding mobility genes.

the presence of a f-like tra unit along the sequences of uwe <dig> is the first evidence of a putative conjugative system in chlamydiae. if conjugation occurs, it most probably takes place within free-living amoebae, that may contain several hundreds of parachlamydia bacteria tightly packed in their vacuoles  <cit> . such a conjugation system would be a mechanism to transfer dna between internalized bacteria sharing an amoebal vacuole. moreover, it may provide molecular genetic tools for obligate intracellular bacteria.

the presence of tra units/operons in the parachlamydial uwe <dig> and in proteobacteria could be explained by an emergence of this unit in a common ancestor of both clades, and by its subsequent loss in chlamydiaceae. another evolutionary scenario is that the tra unit was acquired from a proteobacteria by a parachlamydiaceae in a common amoebal vacuole. since the tra unit is absent from all sequenced chlamydiaceae genomes, this transfer would have occurred after the divergence of parachlamydiaceae and chlamydiaceae, at a time when parachlamydia was already an intracellular bacteria. an intra-amoebal transfer of this gi is supported by the permissivity of free-living amoebae to proteobacteria  <cit> , and by several hints suggesting its proteobacterial origin. though phylogenetic analyses suggested a gamma-proteobacterial origin of the f-like parachlamydial tra, further analyses have to confirm whether this gi module was acquired from an alpha-, beta-, or gamma-proteobacteria unit. we hypothesize that the f-like parachlamydial tra unit has been brought by a lateral transfer from a proteobacterial genome. this hypothesis is strongly supported by the cumulative gc skew analysis  <cit>  producing a signal of the gi differing from that of the remaining of the genome . the value of nucleotide skew analyses as good taxonomical markers is supported by  routine analyses on prokaryotic genome by cumulative ta-skews  <cit>  and  comparison of intragenic nucleotide skews of small subunit ribosomal rna of the whole living world  <cit> . the genometric approach appeared to be able to identify gis of chlamydiales. sequencing additional genomes of environmental chlamydiae, that present a large biodiversity  <cit> , will provide major insights on bacterial evolution and hopefully a better comprehension of the emergence of this parachlamydial gi.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that a gi present on the uwe <dig> chromosome encodes a potentially functional f-like dna conjugative system. this is the first hint of a putative conjugative system in chlamydiae. conjugation most probably occurs within free-living amoebae, that may contain hundreds of parachlamydiaceae bacteria tightly packed in vacuoles. such a conjugative system might be involved in dna transfer between internalized bacteria. since this system is absent from the sequenced genomes of chlamydiaceae, we hypothesize that it was acquired after the divergence between parachlamydiaceae and chlamydiaceae, when the parachlamydia-related symbiont was an intracellular bacteria. it suggests that this heterologous dna was acquired by a parachlamydiaceae from phylogenetically-distant bacteria sharing an amoebal vacuole. since parachlamydiaceae are emerging agents of pneumonia  <cit>  and since many gis are also considered as pathogenicity islands  <cit> , the pam100g gi might be involved in pathogenicity. in future, conjugative systems might be developed as genetic tools for studying chlamydiales.
