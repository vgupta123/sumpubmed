BACKGROUND
adaptive phenotypic evolution may result either from protein-coding mutations that modify the structure and function of genes, or from regulatory mutations that alter the timing, location, or expression of genes  <cit> . although examples of protein-coding mutations that contribute to phenotypic evolution are well known , examples of regulatory mutations that also affect phenotypic adaptation are less well known, but no less important . one class of regulatory mutations, cis-regulatory mutations, are found in close proximity to the genes they regulate and function by altering the binding of transcription factors necessary for gene expression. cis-regulatory mutations exhibit several features that make them ideally suited for adaptive phenotypic evolution, including codominance  <cit>  and modularity  <cit> . these features make cis-regulatory mutations efficient targets for natural selection  <cit>  and limit the negative consequences of pleiotropy that presumably affect many trans-regulatory and protein-coding mutations. finally, since cis-regulatory mutations may underlie many of the adaptive and disease phenotypes found in nature, identifying these alleles remains an important goal of evolutionary genetics. however, identifying cis-regulatory mutations can be challenging without abundant functional genomic resources, since the transcription factor binding sites  they affect are small, lack strict conservation, and are found in difficult-to-annotate regions of the genome  <cit> .

the location of cis-regulatory sequences can be near-to or far-from the genes they regulate. promoter sequences found directly upstream of genes can harbor cis-regulatory alleles  <cit> , as can enhancer or repressor elements located many kilobases away  <cit> . cis-regulatory sequences can even reside within the untranslated regions  of genes, where they alter the binding of micrornas  that regulate gene expression following transcription  <cit> . but where ever their location, two methods commonly used to identify cis-regulatory sequences and alleles are phylogenetic footprinting and phylogenetic shadowing  <cit> . in phylogenetic footprinting, one compares dna surrounding some gene of interest among numerous divergent taxa in hopes of identifying non-coding regions that are highly conserved. by the very nature of their conservation, these conserved non-coding elements  stand out as candidate regulatory sequences, since conservation is often used to indicate function. once candidate regulatory sequences have been identified via phylogenetic footprinting, the method used to identify putative cis-regulatory alleles within them is differential phylogenetic footprinting, or phylogenetic shadowing  <cit> . in phylogenetic shadowing, one compares putative regulatory sequences among closely related taxa in hopes of identifying sequence polymorphisms correlated with the divergent expression of some target gene. following their application, functional genomic analyses are necessary to validate the function of any candidate sequences or alleles identified by the phylogenetic footprinting and shadowing methods; but even by themselves, both methods can provide valuable insights into the location of potential cis-regulatory sequences and the transcription factors that bind them.

the goal of this study is to identify candidate cis-regulatory sequences that control opsin gene expression in african cichlid fishes. opsins are a group of g protein-coupled receptors that confer sensitivity to light and mediate color vision  <cit> . african cichlids comprise a diverse clade of freshwater, teleost fish found throughout the lakes and rivers of africa, including the three african great lakes, lakes tanganyika, malawi, and victoria  <cit> . cichlids from lakes tanganyika and malawi exhibit dramatic variation in their sensitivity to colored light  <cit> . species from these lakes exhibit retinal sensitivities that are maximally sensitive to short, middle, or long-wavelength spectra; in some cases, closely related species can differ in their maximal retinal sensitivity by over  <dig> nm  <cit> . this striking variation makes the cichlid visual system one of the most diverse vertebrate visual systems so far identified. most variation in cichlid color sensitivity is due to changes in the regulation of their cone opsin genes  <cit> . cichlids have seven cone opsin genes used for color vision; these opsins are sws <dig> , sws2b , sws2a , rh2b , rh2a and rh2a , and lws   <cit> . additionally, these opsins are located in three regions of the cichlid genome: sws <dig> is found on cichlid linkage group  17; rh2b, rh2a and rh2a are found together in a tandem array on lg 5; and sws2a, sws2b, and lws form a second tandem array on lg  <dig>  . among different cichlid species, these opsins are alternatively co-expressed in three predominant groups, or palettes, to produce the three common visual pigment sets: sws1-rh2b-rh2a , sws2b-rh2b-rh2a , and sws2a-rh2a-lws   <cit> . cichlids exhibit several correlations between the expression of their opsins and important ecological variables, including foraging preference and ambient light intensity  <cit> . these correlations suggest that opsin gene expression varies adaptively in cichlids, especially since some expression-ecology correlations have evolved independently among cichlids in different lakes  <cit> . a recent quantitative genetic analysis of opsin expression in two lake malawi cichlids found a quantitative trait locus  located near the opsin genes  <cit> . the proximity of this qtl to the opsins suggests that mutations within one or more cis-regulatory sequences may contribute to variation in cichlid opsin expression. but like many non-model systems, few genomic resources are currently available for cichlids, making it difficult to identify potential cis-regulatory alleles and test their association with opsin gene expression.

here, we sequence and analyze bacterial artificial chromosome  clones containing the opsin genes of two african cichlid species, oreochromis niloticus  <cit>  and metriaclima zebra  <cit> . oreochromis niloticus  is a riverine cichlid that expresses the long wavelength-sensitive opsin palette as adults but also expresses the other palettes as fry and juveniles  <cit> . o. niloticus is an outgroup to the diverse haplochromine cichlids endemic to lakes tanganyika, malawi, and victoria. metriaclima zebra  is one such haplochromine cichlid found in lake malawi. m. zebra expresses the short wavelength-sensitive opsin palette as an adult and during all developmental stages  <cit> . both species last shared a common ancestor ~  <dig> mya, whereas m. zebra diverged from other phenotypically diverse lake malawi cichlids less than  <dig> mya  <cit> . after sequencing the opsin-containing bac clones from these species, we used the resulting sequences for several analyses, including:

 annotation and comparison of the opsin-containing regions from the genome assemblies of several model teleosts. we perform phylogenetic footprinting by comparing the opsin-containing regions of o. niloticus and several model fish genomes. we use this comparison to locate conserved non-coding elements  that serve as candidate cis-regulatory sequences for the opsins.

 computational prediction of binding sites for  <dig> transcription factors important for vertebrate opsin expression  <cit>  . we perform this search in each cne as well as within the proximal promoter of each opsin. we also perform an analogous search for mirna target sites within the 3'-utr of each opsin.

 phylogenetic shadowing between o. niloticus and m. zebra using the tfbs and mirna target site profiles found in each cne, promoter, and 3'-utr sequence. in each region we compare the proportion of divergent tfbs/mirna target sites with the amount expected given the over-all sequence divergence of the opsin bacs and introns . these comparisons are used to identify putative cis-regulatory sequences that have undergone significant evolutionary divergence among african cichlids.

 following phylogenetic shadowing, we re-sequence the most divergent regions in a panel of  <dig> phenotypically diverse cichlids from lake malawi. we search these sequences for polymorphisms that may indicate the presence of cis-regulatory alleles. this final analysis allows us to determine whether the divergent regions we identify between o. niloticus and m. zebra also contain polymorphisms correlated with opsin expression in the more closely related cichlids of lake malawi.

we use the final results of this study to examine which regulatory regions are most likely to contain functional regulatory alleles that determine opsin expression in african cichlids. we find that many non-coding regions are highly conserved between o. niloticus and m. zebra, as well as among the closely related cichlids of lake malawi. however, we find at least two cnes, five proximal promoters, and two 3'-utrs that exhibit significant divergence in the number and type of tfbs and mirna targets found between o. niloticus and m. zebra. we also identify at least three alleles that are weakly associated with sws2a, rh2b, and lws expression - three opsins that show strong differential expression among cichlid species. these results suggest that cis-regulatory sequences may contribute to opsin expression differences among african cichlids, and provide numerous candidates for future functional studies.

RESULTS
bac sequencing and analysis
bac identification, sequencing, assembly, and comparison
within the cichlid genome, the opsins are found in three separate tandem arrays. sws <dig> is found alone on cichlid linkage group  17; sws2a, sws2b, and lws are found together in a tandem array on lg  <dig>  <cit> ; and rh2b, rh2aα, and rh2aβ are found in a second tandem array on lg  <dig> approximately  <dig> cm from the sws2-lws array   <cit> . we identified opsin-containing bac clones for o. niloticus by pcr screening  <cit>  and for m. zebra by filter hybridization  <cit> . we then shotgun sequenced each clone using abi sanger or  <dig> life sciences technology. clone ids, estimated sizes, sequencing methods, assembly statistics, final contig length, and genbank accession numbers for resulting contigs are listed in table  <dig>  the average read length for abi-generated sequences was ~ <dig> bp, while the average read length for 454-generated sequences was ~ <dig> bp. for the o. niloticus sws1-containing clone, we used a combination of abi and  <dig> sequences since the assemblies based on abi-generated reads alone were poor. for all other clones, we used additional sanger reads to fill in the gaps and join all contigs into their final bac assemblies . overall, the final assemblies of each clone based on abi and  <dig> technology joined an average of 85% of reads into a single contig that was within  <dig> -  <dig> kb of the estimated clone size . all assemblies successfully covered the opsin-containing regions in o. niloticus and m. zebra.

 <dig> estimated clone size based on pulsed gel electrophoresis.

we aligned each bac assembly from o. niloticus and m. zebra and found them to be highly similar. the only significant difference was a  <dig>  kb insertion in the m. zebra rh2-containing bac, located between the rh2aα, and rh2aβ opsins . this insertion is likely a transposon. the average pairwise jukes-cantor-corrected sequence divergence  across each bac assembly was  <dig> % . this rate of sequence divergence is consistent with comparisons of other genes between these species, and it is one of the first large-scale estimates of sequence divergence between o. niloticus and m. zebra. we then subdivided each bac assembly into opsin protein-coding  and intronic  sequences. for o. niloticus and m. zebra, the mean dxy across all opsin cds was  <dig> % , while the divergence across all int was  <dig> % . . comparison of the average dxy across all regions reveals that the mean divergence of the functionally important opsin cds is significantly lower than dxy across either the bacs or int sequences , but that dxy between bac and int sequences do not differ . in addition to evaluating which regions of each opsin-containing bac retain the highest conservation and are most likely to be functional, these divergence estimates also provide an important null hypothesis for our subsequent analyses using phylogenetic shadowing: in general, we expect o. niloticus and m. zebra to share  ~92% of their tfbs and mirna target sites, and exhibit divergence in ~8%. divergence in greater than 8% of the tfbs and mirna target sites identified may indicate significant cis-regulatory sequence evolution in the regions examined.

bac annotation and the opsin repertoire of teleost fishes
in order to perform phylogenetic footprinting across the opsin arrays of cichlids, we first investigated the synteny of each opsin array of o. niloticus relative to several model fish species using pipmaker  <cit>  and multipipmaker  <cit> . we found considerable synteny in the opsin-containing regions among o. niloticus , gasterosteus aculeatus , oryzias latipes , tetraodon nigroviridis , and danio rerio  . the clearest example of this synteny was the sws2-lws opsin array. this array is flanked by the genes hcfc <dig> and gnl3l and is essentially co-linear in all five fish genomes . we found evidence for a localized duplication of the sws <dig> opsins in o. latipes and o. niloticus, since both these species have two adjacent sws <dig> opsin genes . closely related poeciliid fishes also possess adjacent sws <dig> paralogs  <cit> , suggesting that this duplication event probably occurred at least  <dig> -  <dig> mya at the base of the acanthopterygii  <cit> .

in contrast to the sws2-lws array, we observed considerable variation in opsin gene content for the rh <dig> opsins. o. niloticus and m. zebra possess three rh <dig> genes while d. rerio has four  <cit> , g. aculeatus has two, and t. nigrovirdis has one functional rh <dig> opsin and one rh <dig> pseudogene  <cit> . we therefore used phylogenetic analyses to investigate the orthology of the rh <dig> and sws <dig> genes among these fishes and found that most rh <dig> duplications are species-specific  <cit>  . thus, synteny in the region containing the rh <dig> opsin array was lower than in the sws2-lws array, but was still largely co-linear between o. niloticus, g. aculeatus, and t. nigroviridis . the genes slc6a13-like and synpr flank the rh <dig> opsins in these fishes .

synteny in the region surrounding the sws <dig> opsin was difficult to assess due to species-specific deletions and poor genome assembly. the t. nigrovirdis genome assembly lacks the sws <dig> opsin altogether, and this region is found within an unordered chromosome or ultracontig in both the g. aculeatus and o. latipes genomes. for g. aculeatus, we found a small  <dig> kb region containing the sws <dig> opsin that was collinear with the o. niloticus bac sequence, but which contained one large inversion. for o. latipes, we found an even smaller  <dig> kb region that was syntenic for only  <dig> kb surrounding the sws <dig> opsin. synteny with d. rerio was also generally low . therefore, despite the lack of sws <dig> duplicates compared to the sws <dig> or rh <dig> opsins, the sws <dig> region is still poorly assembled in the existing annotations of several teleost genomes, potentially complicating direct comparisons of synteny in this region. in these species, the sws <dig> opsin appears to be flanked by the genes tnpo <dig> and calua .

analysis of conserved non-coding elements 
phylogenetic footprinting to identify cnes
we used multipipmaker  <cit>  to highlight non-coding elements surrounding each opsin gene array from o. niloticus to d. rerio, representing nearly  <dig> my of fish evolution  <cit> . the resulting plots illustrate at least  <dig> conserved non-coding elements  surrounding the opsin gene arrays of o. niloticus and the other fish species examined . we also found six regions of putatively high conservation that are largely composed of repetitive sequence , which we did not analyze further. the conservation of these cnes over several million years of fish evolution suggests that they contain functionally important regulatory modules necessary for gene expression.

at least one cne we identified through phylogenetic footprinting is orthologous to other vertebrate cis-regulatory sequences. cne  <dig>  consists of two non-contiguous regions of high conservation in pufferfish, stickleback, medaka, swordtails, and cichlids  <cit>  . the first region, cne 7a, was also identified following a comparative analysis of opsin-containing bacs from swordtails   <cit> . through blast and mirbase  <cit> , we found that cne 7a is most similar to zebrafish mirna dre-mir- <dig> , and the same genomic region from zebrafish is identical to this mirna . dre-mir- <dig> is expressed in the retina of larval and adult zebrafish  <cit> . since many mirnas are transcribed along with the genes they regulate, the proximity of mir- <dig> to the sws <dig> and lws opsins suggests that it could play a role in opsin regulation. the ~ <dig> bp cne encoding mir- <dig> is conserved in numerous other taxa as well, including additional fishes, frogs, and lizards  <cit> .

the second highly conserved region, cne 7b, is positionally and structurally orthologous to the mammalian lws locus control region   <cit> . this enhancer is located ~ <dig>  kb upstream of the lws opsin in o. niloticus and other vertebrates, including humans. the lws-lcr is hypothesized to enhance lws expression in eutherian mammals by looping and binding to the lws proximal promoter  <cit> . wang et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the human ortholog of this sequence can function as an enhancer of both lws and mws opsin expression in mice. additionally, a recent study of lws regulation in zebrafish also identified a similar sequence at this position that modulates lws expression in that species, which they named the lws activating region   <cit> . comparison of the mammalian lws-lcr, the zebrafish lar, and cne 7b from cichlids and other teleosts reveals a high degree of sequence similarity among these regions . in figure 2b, we also highlight several conserved transcription factor binding sites common to each sequence, including sites for crx, thr, and ap- <dig> . thus, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the phylogenetic footprinting method for identifying functional cis-regulatory sequences necessary for vertebrate opsin expression. it is therefore possible that the remainder of the cnes we identify also encode cis-regulatory sequences necessary for the correct spatial and developmental expression of the opsins in cichlids.

we note that our present study focuses on small regions of high conservation within a ~ <dig> kb window of non-coding sequence surrounding the opsin arrays, but that cis-regulatory sequences may often reside tens or hundreds of kilobases from the genes they regulate. however, two recent analyses of general transcription factor binding sites found that functional binding sites generally cluster in regions  <dig> kb around the proximal promoter of each gene  <cit> . this observation suggests that a focused study of conserved elements within or near the opsins is a reasonable strategy for this initial study. a fasta file of all cne sequences from o. niloticus and m. zebra is provided in additional file  <dig> 

tfbs search and phylogenetic shadowing of cnes
we compared the  <dig> cnes identified between o. niloticus and m. zebra and found many to be highly conserved; however, we found no identifiable orthologs between o. niloticus and m. zebra for cnes  <dig> or  <dig>  for the remaining cnes, the average pairwise sequence divergence between o. niloticus and m. zebra was  <dig> % , which is significantly less than the mean dxy of introns . this result suggests that the conserved non-coding regions identified among o. niloticus and other fishes have remained conserved among african cichlids as well.

we used the transcription element search system  <cit>  to computationally search all orthologous cnes for binding sites corresponding to twelve transcription factors that have been associated with opsin expression in fishes and other vertebrates including thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors  <cit> . a complete list of these transcription factors and their associated opsins is presented in table  <dig>  we found computationally-predicted binding sites for these functionally important transcription factors in all but one of the cnes surveyed . only cne  <dig> lacked binding sites for any of the twelve transcription factors in either species examined. within the remaining sequences we found binding sites for all twelve transcription factors except pnr and rxrγ. after relaxing our matching criteria, we still failed to find binding sites for these two transcription factors . in both o. niloticus and m. zebra, binding sites for ap- <dig> and crx were extremely abundant, although binding sites for each of three retinoic acid receptors  and thrβ were also common . we found several cnes with a high density of transcription factor binding sites given the total sequence length surveyed - generally  <dig> tfbs or more . for o. niloticus these high-density cnes are cnes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and for m. zebra these are cnes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  due to their potential enrichment for functional tfbss relative to other cnes, we believe these eight cnes represent the most likely candidates for functional cis-regulators of opsin expression in fishes.

consistent with the high similarity of their sequences, the results of our tfbs search differed very little between o. niloticus and m. zebra. we used exact binomial tests to compare the proportion of shared and divergent tfbss observed between o. niloticus and m. zebra to the null ratio of 92: <dig> . treating each tfbs independently, we counted each non-orthologous or divergent tfbs as a success, each orthologous or shared tfbs as a failure, then tested the hypothesis that the true probability of success  was > 8%. of  <dig> testable cnes, we found that o. niloticus and m. zebra differed significantly from this null expectation at four cnes: cnes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . after bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, however, only the results for cne  <dig> remained significant . overall, these results did not change when we used the mean divergence of introns from each cne's nearest down-stream opsin as a null hypothesis, except that o. niloticus and m. zebra also exhibited significant divergence at cne  <dig> . both cne  <dig> and  <dig> are located upstream of the sws2a opsin. for cne  <dig>  o. niloticus has  <dig> tfbs while m. zebra has only one; for cne  <dig>  m. zebra has two while o. niloticus has none. these results are consistent with what one might expect based on the expression of these opsins in adults, since sws2a is highly expressed among o. niloticus adults, but is not expressed in m. zebra  <cit> . thus, we show that o. niloticus and m. zebra have diverged significantly in the identity of their tfbs profiles for two putative cis-regulatory elements , and differ in the presence/absence of two more . three of these cnes  are found upstream of the sws2a opsin . these results offer the compelling possibility that at least some of the differences in opsin expression observed between o. niloticus and m. zebra could be due to divergence in the tfbs profiles of cnes surrounding their opsins.

we acknowledge that our use of the overall proportion of divergent tfbs  to detect cnes that have undergone significant cis-regulatory divergence ignores many nuances of tfbs evolution, such as the overall number and kind of tfbs present in each cne and species. but because of the small number of tfbss found within each cne , it is difficult to perform robust tests of divergence in the number of binding sites for individual transcription factors. therefore, we have summed all tfbss into orthologous  and non-orthologous  groups in order to perform phylogenetic shadowing between o. niloticus and m. zebra. however, even within these broad categories, we have only enough power that cnes with pdiv > 25% stand out as statistical outliers, and only those with pdiv > 80% remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons. in the future we aim to perform more nuanced, sequence-based tests of cis-regulatory divergence in cichlids. we present these tests for cis-regulatory divergence as a first step in this process.

analysis of proximal promoter regions
phylogenetic footprinting of opsin proximal promoters
the multipip plots shown in figure  <dig> reveal  <dig> cnes upstream of the opsins, but also show several regions of high conservation within the 5' proximal promoter of multiple opsins as well. in particular, sws2a, sws2b, and lws all exhibit regions of high conservation in the first  <dig> kb of sequence upstream of their translation start site . for the lws opsin, this region of conservation spans nearly  <dig>  kb of the proximal promoter in multiple fish species, including g. aculeatus, o. latipes, and t. nigroviridis . rh2a and rh2a also exhibit some small regions of high conservation just upstream of their tsss, which probably reflect the 5'-utr region. additionally, the promoter upstream of rh2b also contains some conserved regions of repetitive sequence . it is compelling that many of the opsins exhibit strong conservation of sequences within  <dig> kb of their tsss, which we use to define the proximal promoter, because the true promoter regions for these genes are unknown in cichlids. however, important cis-regulatory sequences have been identified in close proximity to the opsin genes in other fish species. in particular, several crx transcription factor binding sites found within  <dig> bp of the sws <dig> opsin regulate the expression of this gene in d. rerio  <cit> . therefore, the conservation we observe upstream of the sws2a, sws2b, and lws opsins may indicate the presence of additional cis-regulatory sequences within the proximal promoters of these genes as well. a fasta file of all opsin and non-opsin promoter sequences  from o. niloticus and m. zebra is presented in additional file  <dig> 

tfbs search and phylogenetic shadowing of opsin proximal promoters
the distribution and number of tfbss found within the proximal promoter region of each opsin was similar to those found in the cnes. within each opsin's proximal promoter, we found that ap- <dig> and crx binding sites were nearly ubiquitous . binding sites for nfκb, rarα, rarβ, rxrβ and thrβ were also common, and we once again found no binding sites for pnr and rxrγ. the absence of binding sites for pnr and rxrγ in both the cnes and promoters may rule-out these factors as candidate trans-regulators of cichlid opsin expression differences; however the lack of these factors could also be due to biases in the way tess identifies binding sites. interestingly, we found several crx binding sites directly upstream of the sws2a and sws2b opsins . these binding sites could potentially function as regulators of sws <dig> opsin expression in cichlids as they do in zebrafish  <cit> .

pairwise sequence divergence in the proximal promoter regions was greater than for the other regions examined. the average dxy of the proximal promoters was  <dig> % , which differed significantly from the mean of cnes , but not the introns . this result suggests that the opsin promoter regions of cichlids may exhibit greater divergence in putative cis-regulatory sequences than the cnes. indeed, we found that o. niloticus and m. zebra exhibited significant divergence in their tfbs profiles for six of the seven proximal promoters examined ; however, following correction for multiple hypothesis testing, only five of these remained significant: sws <dig>  sws2a, rh2b, rh2a and rh2a . o. niloticus and m. zebra differ dramatically in the expression of each of these genes  <cit> , suggesting that their divergent transcription factor profiles could explain these differences. a comparison of which tfbs differ between o. niloticus and m. zebra reveals a slight over-representation of crx sites in o. niloticus , and of thrα sites in m. zebra  .

using phylogenetic shadowing, we identified five cichlid opsins with promoter sequences that exhibit significant divergence in their binding site profiles for  <dig> transcription factors. we note, however, that by focusing on only these tfbss, we potentially miss many interesting patterns of divergence in transcription factors that have not already been associated with vertebrate opsin expression. a comprehensive search of all tfbss identified by tess could potentially pick up these missed patterns, but such a search would be extremely cumbersome and subject to many false positives  <cit> . because of their small size, tfbs motifs are likely to appear throughout the genome frequently by chance, and it is difficult to determine which are likely to be functional based on sequence matches alone. therefore, we opted to focus on genes that are obvious candidates for analysis.

we performed an additional analysis to determine the relevance of these twelve candidate factors by comparing the number of tfbss found for each factor within the proximal promoters of the opsins and seven randomly chosen non-opsin genes. we hypothesized that if these candidates are relevant to the control of opsin expression in cichlids, then we should find a significantly greater number of tfbss for each factor upstream of the opsin genes compared to the non-opsin genes. indeed, we found that the opsins contain a greater number of binding sites for eight out of ten factors compared to the randomly-chosen non-opsin genes . the non-opsin promoters contained higher mean numbers of tfbss for ap- <dig> and thrα only. this result suggests that the proximal promoters of the opsins are significantly enriched for the binding sites of transcription factors that influence vertebrate opsin expression. this enrichment also suggests that polymorphisms in these regions could conceivably lead to functional differences in transcription factor binding and opsin expression. however, we note that we found no significant correlation between distance matrices of the opsins based on these tfbs profiles and their expression in developing o. niloticus . this additional result suggests that, although binding sites for many of these candidate transcription factors may be over-represented in the promoters of opsins, they do not predict which opsins are co-expressed in african cichlids.

the search parameters we have chosen aim to identify tfbss with high confidence while still accounting for the observation that many transcription factors exhibit degenerate binding of dna motifs  <cit> , and can bind these motifs in an orientation-independent manner  <cit> . we are currently performing a quantitative genetic analysis of many markers located across the genome in order to identify other loci and transcription factors that may be associated with cichlid opsin expression. this quantitative genetic analysis should provide an unbiased search for additional transcription factors that may influence cichlid opsin expression.

analysis of opsin 3'-utrs
phylogenetic footprinting of opsin 3'-utrs
in addition to mutations within conserved non-coding elements and 5' promoter regions, polymorphisms within 3'-utrs can also act as cis-regulatory alleles  <cit> . these polymorphisms affect gene expression by altering the binding of mirnas in a manner analogous to how mutations within tfbs can alter gene expression, except that mirnas inhibit gene expression post-transcriptionally. our phylogenetic footprinting analysis reveals that every opsin exhibits some conservation of the  <dig> -  <dig> bp region found directly downstream of the opsin coding sequences . generally, this conservation is strongest between o. niloticus, o. latipes, and g. aculeatus, reflecting the close phylogenetic relationship among these species. for rh2a, the 3' conserved region extends nearly  <dig> bp past the end of the coding region. initially, these results suggest that the opsin 3'-utrs of cichlids will be highly conserved, reflecting the strong evolutionary constraint on utr sequence and function seen in both flies and humans  <cit> . however, a recent survey of polymorphisms affecting mirna target sites in cichlids found that the 3'-utr of some genes may in fact be under divergent selection in african cichlids  <cit> . therefore, we searched the 3'-utrs of the opsins for target sites corresponding to known fish mirnas.

of the  <dig> known mirna targets we searched for in cichlids , we found at least one target site in each opsin 3'-utr that was conserved among cichlids and other teleosts . many of these conserved sites are expressed within the retina of vertebrates and play a role in retinal development  <cit> . for example, dre-mir- <dig>  dre-mir-181a, and dre-mir-23b are all integral to the development and maintenance of the zebrafish retina  <cit> , while dre-mir- <dig> and dre-mir-182a are sensory organ-specific  <cit> . only one conserved site that was found in cichlids and other teleosts differed between o. niloticus and m. zebra. a target for dre-mir- <dig>  found downstream of the lws opsin in o. niloticus and the pufferfish , is missing in the orthologous 3'-utr from m. zebra due to a single nucleotide polymorphism . however, the two conserved target sites for dre-mir- <dig> and dre-mir- <dig> are both found within the 3'-utrs of several lake victorian cichlids . like o. niloticus, lake victoria's cichlids express the long wavelength opsin palette as adults  <cit> , possibly indicating that these factors play a role in lws expression. if we interpret evolutionary conservation as an indication of function, we believe the conserved sites listed in table  <dig> represent those mirna target sites that are most likely to regulate opsin expression in african cichlids. the sequences of all o. niloticus and m. zebra opsin 3'-utrs are available in additional file  <dig>

we searched the 3'-utrs of each opsin in o. niloticus and m. zebra for target sites corresponding to known fish mirnas  <cit> . in all, we identified  <dig> predicted target sites matching  <dig> known mirnas from cichlids and d. rerio . like the cnes and promoter regions analyzed earlier, all 3'-utr sequences generally exhibited high similarity between o. niloticus and m. zebra. the average pairwise divergence  for o. niloticus and m. zebra 3'-utrs was  <dig> % . this small level of divergence is very similar to the level observed for opsin coding sequences, though it did not differ from the average dxy of introns . consequently, the results of our mirna target search were once again very similar for o. niloticus and m. zebra, especially for those sites conserved in other fishes as well . however, we still found that o. niloticus and m. zebra differed significantly in the proportion of divergent and shared mirna target sites for the 3'-utrs of the rh2b and sws2b opsins . these results did not change when we altered the null hypothesis to reflect the divergence of each opsin's intronic sequence . for rh2b, we found that m. zebra exhibited four unique target sites for mirs- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  for sws2b, m. zebra had unique targets for mirnas- <dig> and  <dig>  while o. niloticus had targets for mirnas - <dig> and  <dig>  rh2b is strongly differentially expressed in these two species, while sws2b is only expressed in some adults of o. niloticus  <cit> . thus, we not only identified at least  <dig> conserved--and perhaps core--mirna target sites in the 3'-utr of each cichlid opsin , we also found that o. niloticus and m. zebra are significantly divergent in at least two of these regions .

it is important to note that most mirna target sites we identified in the 3'-utrs of the cichlid opsins correspond to mirnas that are expressed in the vertebrate retina . of sites corresponding to  <dig> different mirnas,  <dig>  correspond to mirnas expressed within the retinas of fish, mammals, or amphibians . notably, however, we did not find any mirna target sites that correspond to mir- <dig>  the mirna found upstream of the lws opsin and encoded by cne 7a . further, many of the conserved and non-conserved mirna target sites we identify also correspond to mirnas associated with retinal development   <cit> , and mir- <dig> is also associated with retinoblastoma in humans  <cit> . given that o. niloticus and m. zebra differ dramatically in their developmental patterns of opsin gene expression, it is interesting to speculate that these mirnas could contribute to the developmental differences in opsin expression observed between these and other african cichlid species  <cit> 

in the present study we have focused on mirna target sites found within the 3'-utr of the cichlid opsins, but mirna cleavage of messenger rnas by binding to sites within core messenger rna sequences has also been demonstrated in humans and plants  <cit> . it is still not clear whether mirnas regulate gene expression more often by binding to the 3'-utr or messenger rna sequence, although a review by bartel  <cit>  suggested that translational repression by binding to utr sequences is more prominent. finally, we note also that the cellular machinery cannot distinguish between functional and non-functional mirna target sites based on their evolutionary conservation in other species, as we do here  <cit>  . however, given that scans for mirna target sites can have a high rate of false positives, evolutionary conservation is currently the best way to avoid high error rates and to infer function. the fact that we identified a high percentage of target sites that correspond to mirnas found within the vertebrate eye suggests that many of these sites are not false-positives; therefore, it is plausible that they may actually function to regulate opsin expression in cichlids. in the future we will determine whether these and other mirnas are actually expressed in the retinas of african cichlids. if so, then heterologous reporter assays could be used to verify what role divergence in mirna target sites may play in the evolution of cichlid opsin expression  <cit> .

phylogenetic shadowing among the cichlids of lake malawi
resequencing and analysis of lws-lcr, opsin promoters, and 3'-utrs
two broad goals of this study have been to  identify potential cis-regulatory sequences surrounding the opsin gene arrays of african cichlids , and  identify those sequences whose divergence may explain patterns of differential opsin gene expression among african cichlids . for both goals we have relied on sequenced bac clones of oreochromis niloticus and metriaclima zebra--two species that have bac libraries available, but that also differ dramatically in their evolutionary age  and adult and developmental patterns of opsin expression  <cit> . therefore, as a final goal, we wanted to determine whether the candidate cis-regulatory sites we identified via phylogenetic shadowing also vary among a more closely related  panel of  <dig> cichlid species from lake malawi. although much more closely related to m. zebra than o. niloticus, adults of these species exhibit the same opsin expression patterns as adult and juvenile o. niloticus  <cit> . our panel included one individual from six species for each of the three adult opsin expression palettes observed among lake malawi's cichlids  . the regions we re-sequenced included the proximal promoters upstream of the sws <dig>  sws2a, sws2b, rh2b, and lws opsins , the lws-lcr , and the 3'-utrs of the sws2b and lws opsins. after sequencing, we examined these regions for levels of interspecific polymorphism and performed a test of association for cis-regulatory alleles.

although the  <dig> lake malawi cichlid species we use have been previously characterized with regard to opsin gene expression, we confirmed these gene expression results by measuring the expression of each opsin in all species via rt-qpcr . these expression results were highly concordant with previous measurements  <cit> . following qpcr, we re-sequenced the entire  <dig> kb region upstream of both the sws <dig> and sws2a opsins,  <dig> bp upstream of the lws opsin,  <dig> bp upstream of the rh2b opsin, and  <dig> bp upstream of the sws2b opsin. we also re-sequenced  <dig> bp surrounding the lws-lcr  and  <dig> bp downstream of the sws2b and lws opsins. as expected given the young age of lake malawi cichlids, we found that all regions were highly conserved among the species sampled. overall, we identified fewer than  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertion/deletions  per region examined . in each case, most snps were found in only one individual. other diversity statistics--including the total number of segregating sites , total number of singletons , number of haplotypes , nucleotide diversity , sequence conservation , and tajima's d --also indicate low levels of polymorphism, despite our use of alternate species and genera as sampling units . nevertheless, following a sliding window analysis of nucleotide diversity  and minor allele frequency , we were able to identify several peaks of relatively highπ and maf within each region . these peaks correspond to snps and indels segregating at high frequency within the species and genera sampled, and therefore represent potential cis-regulatory alleles.

several peaks of relatively high nucleotide diversity and maf correspond to polymorphisms within predicted crx binding sites, but none correspond to any other tfbs or mirna target sites . specifically, two peaks of π and maf located - <dig> and - <dig> bp upstream of the sws2a translation start site  correspond to a single snp and  <dig> bp indel that both disrupt putative crx binding sites. the  <dig> bp indel located at sws2a- <dig> completely eliminates the crx binding site in several species . we identified at least three other polymorphisms upstream of the sws <dig> and rh2b opsins that also disrupt crx binding sites--each present in only a single species--but no polymorphisms that interrupt the binding sites of any other candidate transcription factors. one peak of nucleotide diversity at position  <dig> of cne  <dig>  corresponds to a snp within the mirna mir-726; however, this mutation does not occur within the mature mirna sequence. finally, we found only three polymorphisms total within the 3'-utr of both the sws2b and lws opsins , none of which interrupted predicted mirna target sites. the polymorphism that segregates between o. niloticus and m. zebra within the lws 3'-utr was fixed in all lake malawi cichlid species . thus, few of the polymorphisms we identify in the putative cis-regulatory sequences of the opsins are predicted to alter opsin expression among  <dig> lake malawi cichlid species. however, since mutations within transcription factor binding sites have been shown to alter gene expression  <cit> , our results suggest that polymorphisms within crx tfbss could contribute to the differential patterns of sws2a expression observed among lake malawi cichlids.

association between polymorphisms and cichlid opsin expression
to test this hypothesis, we performed allelic association tests between these and other snps underlying peaks of nucleotide diversity and high maf  with the expression of their nearest downstream opsin . three polymorphisms  exhibited significant or marginally non-significant associations with the expression of their downstream opsins ; however only rh2b- <dig> is significant following bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons . despite this limitation, we believe these preliminary results are compelling since all three polymorphisms occur on the same linkage group  believed to contain a cis-regulatory element that modulates cichlid opsin expression, and all three are associated with opsins whose expression is significantly associated with this qtl in african cichlids  <cit> . sws2a- <dig> obliterates a crx binding site in numerous cichlids, and polymorphisms affecting crx binding sites have been shown to modulate sws <dig> opsin expression in zebrafish  <cit> . cne 7- <dig> is found very near the lws-lcr and could potentially affect lcr binding. it is therefore possible that all three alleles acts as, or are linked to, cis-regulatory elements that modulate opsin expression in cichlids.

* these polymorphisms interrupt crx transcription factor binding sites

we acknowledge that the sample sizes we use for phylogenetic shadowing among lake malawi's cichlids are small and at best provide a weak test for cis-regulatory alleles associated with opsin expression. additionally, we use cross species and genera comparisons for an analysis that is generally based on individual variation within populations. however, lake malawi cichlids are extremely similar at the genetic level and share many ancestral polymorphisms  <cit> . for this reason, genetic analyses across cichlid species are analogous to within-species polymorphism studies in other vertebrates, such as chimps and humans  <cit> . additionally, recent work in cichlids has successfully used cross-species comparisons to fine-map cis-regulatory alleles underlying pigmentation differences, so long as these differences have a common origin among the different species sampled  <cit> . it is hard to predict which traits will have a common origin among different african cichlid species, as previous work  <cit>  suggested that the pigmentation trait mapped in roberts et al.  <cit>  had evolved several times. our recent work reconstructing the evolution of opsin regulatory changes in cichlids revealed that the three opsin expression palettes have evolved repeatedly among cichlids in lakes tanganyika and malawi  <cit> , but it is still unclear whether or not the three palettes have a common origin among lake malawi's cichlids. but despite our small sample size, we have found some evidence of binding site turnover in crx binding sites within the 5' promoters of lake malawi cichlids, but no evidence of turnover in other candidates tfbs or mirna target sites. additionally, we also identified three putative cis-regulatory polymorphisms associated with sws2a, rh2b, and lws opsin expression. although very preliminary, these results offer compelling candidates for additional functional and association analyses between more closely related cichlid populations and species.

the search for cis-regulatory sequences
cis-regulatory sequences may reside many kilobases away from the genes they regulate, as in the case of enhancer or repressor elements; or they may be found very near their genetic targets, as in the case of promoter elements and utrs. given this diversity, is it possible to predict which non-coding regions are most likely to contain functional cis-regulatory alleles? if we accept estimates of pairwise sequence divergence  as indicative of those regions most likely to contain functional opsin regulatory alleles, then our estimates of dxy between o. niloticus and m. zebra suggest that the proximal promoter regions are most likely to contain cis-regulatory alleles that alter opsin expression . the opsin promoters exhibit the highest levels of pairwise sequence divergence of all coding and non-coding regions examined, and also contain more sequences with divergent tfbs profiles , and putative regulatory alleles . however, this conclusion is undoubtedly influenced by what could be a naive choice of promoter sequences , increased length of the promoter sequence relative to other regions analyzed , and the increased power to detect significant divergence from null expectations afforded by the large number of tfbs found within the proximal promoters .

if the overall proportion of divergent tfbs/mirna target sites  is used to identify those non-coding regions most likely to contain functional cis-regulatory alleles, the proximal promoter regions still exhibit the highest proportion of divergent regulatory regions, although the advantage is only slight. only about 55% of tfbs are shared between o. niloticus and m. zebra promoters, while 45% are divergent . in contrast, the cnes and 3'-utrs exhibit lower  proportions of shared versus divergent tfbs/mirna target sites . in this case, it is difficult to confidently conclude that 5' promoter regions are more likely to contain functional alleles that regulate opsin expression, although the data are suggestive. when both pairwise divergence and the proportion divergent tfbs/mirna target sites are taken into account, we find that regions that exhibit statistically significant divergence are not necessarily those regions that exhibit greater pairwise sequence divergence . in fact, the regions with the highest pdiv also exhibit some of the lowest dxy values. this result suggests that the increased number of statistically divergent promoter regions we observe is not a function of sequence divergence, but rather increased statistical power afforded by the greater length of the sequences surveyed and the greater number of tfbs found.

additionally, our results show that the majority of the non-coding regions examined exhibit pdiv values near 37%, with a median of 30% . this observation suggests that the 8% divergence criterion we used as null model for evolutionary divergence is likely too low and also suggests that our power for many regions was inadequate due to the small number of tfbs or mirna target sites identified . but even when a more liberal null divergence value of 30% is used, our results largely remain consistent: o. niloticus and m. zebra still exhibit significant divergence in their tfbs and mirna target profiles for cnes  <dig> and  <dig> , the proximal promoters for rh2b and sws <dig>  and the 3'-utr for sws2b .

finally, we note that many putative regulatory regions identified in our opsin-containing bacs are highly conserved among many phenotypically diverse cichlid species from lake malawi, as well as between the ~ <dig> my divergent oreochromis niloticus and metriaclima zebra. this conservation suggests that trans-acting factors may also play an important role in generating evolutionary changes in cichlid opsin expression. for example, in both yeast and humans, interspecific differences in gene expression are primarily the result of trans-regulatory factors  <cit> . and although cis-regulatory alleles contribute more to interspecific differences in gene expression among several drosophila species, trans-acting alleles generally contribute to these differences as well  <cit> . coding mutations within trans-acting transcription factors can act in a modular fashion, thereby mitigating negative pleiotropic effects  <cit> , and these mutations may still affect gene expression even when the sites they bind remain conserved  <cit> , as many of the tfbss we examine are. also, in addition to the putative cis-regulatory factors associated with sws2b, sws2a, and rh2b opsin expression in cichlids, carleton et al.  <cit>  also identified one trans-acting locus in the same cross, as well as another trans-acting locus in a separate cross. these two loci, located on cichlid lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  do not occur in linkage with the cichlid opsins and explain a higher portion of the variance in opsin expression than the single cis-associated factor on lg  <dig>  <cit> . whether these sites represent transcription factors, mirnas, or other trans-acting binding sites is unknown, but several good candidate genes are located in these regions. future work will aim to map and characterize these putative trans-regulatory regions in a variety of cichlid taxa.

CONCLUSIONS
mutations within cis-regulatory regions are compelling candidates for the adaptive evolution of gene expression  <cit> . here we generated and surveyed non-coding sequences surrounding the opsin gene arrays of two african cichlids, oreochromis niloticus and metriaclima zebra. this study is the first to systematically survey the cichlid opsins for putative cis-regulatory sequences, and our results suggest that these regions could potentially contribute to variation in cichlid opsin expression. the results of our study reveal:

 the presence of numerous conserved non-coding elements located up- and downstream of the opsins that may function as regulators of cichlid opsin expression, including a retinal mirna and one known opsin enhancer . african cichlids were divergent in two of these .

 significant divergence and enrichment of transcription factor binding sites within the proximal promoter of five of the seven opsins .

 numerous target sites for retinal and sensory organ-specific mirnas within the 3'-utr of each opsin. african cichlids were divergent in two of their opsin 3'-utrs .

 the presence of several candidate cis-regulatory alleles located within the promoters of the rh2b and sws2a opsins, as well as one near the lws-lcr .

future work will aim to further characterize these candidate cis-regulatory sequences, as well as to identify candidate trans-acting alleles. given that spectral sensitivity and opsin expression in vertebrates can be influenced by coding mutations  <cit> , trans-regulatory mutations  <cit> , cis-regulatory mutations  <cit> , and possibly mirnas as well, cichlids may represent an ideal system in which to examine how these various molecular mechanisms interact to influence the evolution of visual system diversity in vertebrates.
