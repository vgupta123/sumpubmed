BACKGROUND
unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine  motifs are considered to be pathogen-associated molecular patterns because of their abundance in microbial genomes but scarcity in vertebrate ones  <cit> . short, single-stranded, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides with cpg motifs  can induce the th1-type immune response through interaction with toll-like receptor  <dig> , a member of the toll-like family of pattern-recognition receptors  <cit> . because th1-type cytokines such as ifn-γ and il- <dig> can inhibit the th2-type response  <cit> , cpg odns are thought to have potential for various immune therapies such as for cancer, asthma, pollinosis, and infectious diseases  <cit> .

to date, at least four different types of immune-stimulatory cpg odns with distinct structural and biological characteristics have been reported  <cit> . the class a cpg odns consist of phosphodiester , cpg-containing, palindromic motifs with phosphorothioate , poly-g motifs at both the 5' and 3' ends. cpg odns in this class can induce high levels of interferon-α  production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells , but are weak stimulators of tlr9-dependent nf-κb signaling  <cit> . on the other hand, the class b cpg odns consist entirely of pto backbones and do not form palindromic structures. these odns can strongly activate b cells through nf-κb signaling but show no effect on ifn-α production  <cit> . the class c cpg odns show an intermediate immune property between classes a and b, since these cpg odns have cpg-containing palindromic motifs consisting of only a pto backbone  <cit> . recently, a novel type of cpg odn called the p class, which has two palindromic motifs with a pto backbone, was reported to show higher potential to produce ifn-α and activate nf-κb  <cit> .

natural pd-odns are susceptible to nuclease degradation, which renders them inactive for tlr <dig> activation in the free form. therefore, all cpg odns classified above partially or completely contain a pto backbone to increase resistance to nuclease degradation in the serum  <cit> . however, the pto backbone has been reported to cause unwanted side effects such as unspecific binding to various proteins  <cit>  and renal damage  <cit> . therefore, because of safety considerations, the development of novel natural cpg odns consisting of an entirely pd backbone is desirable. furthermore, these natural cpg odns should be able to strongly activate tlr9-dependent nf-κb signaling. to develop such a cpg odn, we examined the effects of the sugar backbone, the sequence of the cpg motif, and modification of both terminals in cpg odns on nf-κb activation. we found that a series of linked pd sequences of odn <dig>  has the potential to resist nuclease degradation and to activate nf-κb through tlr <dig> at even lower concentrations than are known for pto odns.

RESULTS
natural cpg odns consisting of a pd backbone have no potential to activate tlr <dig> because of degradation
to develop natural cpg odns with a pd backbone that are capable of strong human tlr <dig> activation, the odn <dig> sequence, a well-known class b agonist of htlr <dig>  <cit> , was used as a basic sequence for designing cpg odns. tlr <dig> activation was assessed by relative nf-κb activation in human tlr9-expressing cells , since tlr <dig> activation by cpg odns leads to activation of nf-κb  <cit> . we synthesized an odn <dig> sequence consisting of either a pd or pto backbone   and examined the effect of the backbone composition on nf-κb activity. pd-odn <dig> showed little potential for activating tlr <dig>  as demonstrated by the increased nf-κb activity, whereas pto-odn <dig> significantly activated nf-κb in a dose-dependent manner . identical to previous reports on the susceptibility of natural pd odns to nuclease degradation  <cit> , pd-odn <dig> likely showed low potential for activating tlr <dig> because of degradation in the serum . in contrast, pto-odn <dig> still remained as clear band after serum treatment, but a high-molecular-weight band was also observed . this band could be attributable to proteins binding to the pto backbone rather than being specifically associated with the pto-odn <dig> sequences, since brown et al.  <cit>  also reported binding of proteins to odns with pto backbones. our result suggests that pto-odn <dig> resists nuclease degradation, but that an unfavorable reaction may also be occurring in the serum. therefore, novel gpg odns that can stimulate tlr <dig> activity need to resist nucleolytic degradation as well as not react with serum proteins.

peptide nucleic acid inhibits tlr <dig> activation
peptide nucleic acids , which have backbones composed of repeated n--glycine units linked by peptide bonds, have been developed to solve the problem of biological instability in short-stranded dna or synthetic odns  <cit> . thus, we examined the potential of odn <dig> consisting of a peptide backbone  for tlr <dig> activation. however, no enhancement of tlr <dig> activity was observed . interestingly, pd-odn <dig> showed higher potential when lyovec, a cationic lipid, was used as a carrier to prevent nucleolytic degradation, but the carrier had no effect for pna-odn <dig>  this indicates that the lack of tlr <dig> activation by pna-odn <dig> is attributable to pna and that the sugar backbone of cpg odn is essential for tlr <dig> activation.

cpg odns activate tlr <dig> in a sequence-dependent manner
next, we tried to design novel cpg odn sequences with a higher potential for activating tlr <dig> than odn <dig>  to determine if mutation or deletion of cg units could improve cpg odn design, we prepared different mutants of pto-odn <dig>  by replacing cg unit with gc unit and then examined their potential. nf-κb activity was dramatically decreased by pto-odn2006-gc, an odn in which all four cg units had been replaced with gc ones , indicating the importance of the cg units for tlr <dig> activation. interestingly, the third cg unit in pto-odn <dig> appeared to be the most important one, since lower activity was observed for pto-odn2006-3gc than for the three other odns with a single gc substitution . similarly, lower activity was also observed for pto-odn2006- <dig> ,4gc, pto-odn2006- <dig> gc, and pto-odn2006- <dig> gc, than for pto-odn2006- <dig> gc. this suggests that the position and number of cg units in odn <dig> are critical for tlr <dig> activation, and that neither mutation nor deletion of the cg units can enhance activity.

modification at the 3'-end of pd-odn <dig> improves tlr <dig> activation
exonucleases cleave nucleotides one at a time from the terminal end of a polynucleotide chain. thus, we modified the pd-odn <dig> 5' and 3' terminal ends using biotin, fitc, and amino groups  to examine whether these changes would improve the potential for tlr <dig> activation. as shown in figure 2a, modifications at the 3'-end of pd-odn <dig> enhanced nf-κb activity relative to no modification of pd-odn <dig>  however, no significant change was observed by modifying the 5'-end. to clarify why the 3'-modifications improved the activity, we incubated the 3'-modified pd-odn2006s in serum and found that they showed improved resistance to degradation .

we further modified the pd-odn2006s by adding two 14-mer oligonucleotides  consisting of a pd backbone  . these odns showed enhanced nf-κb activity relative to the unmodified pd-odn <dig> . interestingly, modification at the 5'-end also improved activity . this seemed to be due to the presence of cg units remaining after degradation, since molecules were detected even after incubation in serum .

pd-odn <dig> series acts as a novel type of tlr <dig> agonist
since the addition of the 14-mer oligonucleotides to the 3'-end of pd-odn <dig> significantly improved stability and led to increased nf-κb activity, we examined the effect of adding other oligonucleotide sequences to the 3'-end of pd-odn <dig>  three types of modified pd-odn <dig> sequences were designed. pd-odn2006-3'-a- <dig> and pd-odn2006-3'-b- <dig> were constructed from an odn <dig> sequence extension at the 3'-end of pd-odn2006-3'-a and pd-odn2006-3'-b, respectively . for these odns, oligonucleotides a and b were linkers between the two pd-odn2006s. as the third modified sequence, pd-odn2006- <dig> comprised two directly linked pd-odn2006s. all three structures increased nf-κb activity in a dose-dependent manner . although pd-odn2006-3'-a- <dig> and pd-odn2006-3'-b- <dig> enhanced activity to a further extent compared to pd-odn2006-3'-a and pd-odn2006-3'-b at the same concentration  , pd-odn2006- <dig> was more effective than pd-odn2006-3'-a- <dig> and pd-odn2006-3'-b- <dig> at every concentration. all three 3'-modified pd-odn2006s with oligonucleotides resisted nucleolytic degradation as well as the other 3'-end modified pd-odn <dig> .

it has been reported that the gtcgtt sequence is a core cpg motif for htlr <dig> activation  <cit> . thus, the effect of the 3'-end extension of pd-odn <dig> by this core motif was examined. pd-odn2006-3'-tcgtcgtt and pd-odn2006-3'-tcgtcgttttgtcgtt contain one and two core motif at the 3' end, respectively . as the pd-odn <dig> sequence contains three core motifs, these cpg odns represented a total of four and five core motifs. pd-odn2006- <dig> and pd-odn2006-2006- <dig> also have six and nine core motifs, respectively . as shown in figure 3a, the potential for tlr <dig> activation depended on the number of core motifs. in particular, pd-odn2006-2006- <dig> enhanced the activity even at a concentration of  <dig>  μm. moreover, pd-odn2006- <dig> showed much higher potential than pd-odn2006-3'-tcgtcgttttgtcgtt at concentrations below  <dig>  μm.

linked series of pd-odn <dig>  also showed higher potential than that reported for pd-odn2006-g <dig>  the backbone of which consists of pd entirely  <cit> . these differences were especially significant at the lower concentrations . a higher molecular band was observed for pd-odn2006-g <dig>  which may be attributable to a supramolecular structure formed by the poly-g tails  <cit> . however, none were observed for the odns consisting of pd-odn <dig> in a series . to examine whether nf-κb activation by pd-odns is mediated by tlr <dig>  we used 293xl-null cells. these tlr9-deficient cells did not show any significant increase in nf-κb activity when stimulated either by pto-odn <dig> or our novel pd-odns .

we also assessed the potential of pd-odns using b lymphocyte ramos-blue cells. pd-odn2006- <dig> had similar potential to pd-odn2006-g <dig>  but less than pto-odn <dig>  however, the potential of pd-odn2006-2006- <dig> was much higher than that of pd-odn2006-g <dig> and almost the same as pto-odn <dig> . in addition, pd-odn2006-2006- <dig> had higher potential to induce il- <dig> secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  than pd-odn2006-g <dig> and pto-odn <dig>  although no significant change was observed . we also examined the il- <dig> secretion in plasmacytoid dendritic cells . for pd-odn2006-2006- <dig>  the secretion of il- <dig> was higher than pd-odn2006-g <dig> and pto-odn  <dig>  which was consistent with what was observed in the pbmcs. however, the secretion of il- <dig> by the stimulation of pbs and pd-odn <dig> was not detected in this cell line .

discussion
synthetic oligonucleotides in recent use are usually protected from degradation by modification of the backbone, whereas natural cpg odns are readily degraded by ubiquitous nucleases both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . the cpg odns developed in this study consist of only a natural pd backbone, which may eliminate the side effects introduced by the pto backbone modification. moreover, by connecting two or three simple odns, we obtained novel cpg odns with better nuclease tolerance and higher immunostimulatory potential in htlr9-dependent nf-κb activation.

we used the sequence of a typical class b cpg odn  to develop novel agonists for human tlr <dig>  in our in vitro model system, it was shown that natural pd-odn <dig> likely had very little potential for activating nf-κb due to degradation by serum nucleases. tlr <dig> activation requires the internalization of cpg odns into the late endosome/lysosome of tlr9-expressing cells for recognition. therefore, protection of the odns from degradation is an initial step in maintaining their activity. hence, pto backbones are commonly used to protect the open ends of linear oligonucleotides. although pto-odn <dig> demonstrated much higher potential for tlr <dig> activation than pd-od <dig>  it was not a perfect candidate as an immunotherapeutic agent. the pto backbone modification led to nonspecific interactions between pto-odn <dig> and serum proteins, as shown with the high-molecular-weight band for this odn, whereas no bands were obtained for pd-odn <dig>  this result also suggests that the side effects of pto-odns may be a product of the backbone modification and may not be related to the increased half-life.

pna is a dna analog in which the natural phosphodiester backbone of dna is replaced by a 2-aminoethyl-glycine linkage. pna modification is widely used to increase the biological stability of short-stranded dna when developing antisense technology  <cit> . we examined the effect of the pna-odn <dig> sequence, but no significant increase in activity was observed. haas et al. suggested that the dna sugar backbone  determines tlr <dig> activation because they found that the corresponding rna ribo-oligonucleotides could not activate tlr <dig>  <cit> . in our study, the inhibitory effect of pna-odn also supports the suggestion that the 2' deoxyribose in the dna plays a crucial role in tlr <dig> activation.

we concluded from the decreased activity of the mutated pto-odn <dig> that all the cg units in odn <dig> were essential for activation. moreover, the third cg seemed to be the most important unit for tlr <dig> activation. hence, protection of the cg units from degradation in natural pd-odn <dig> is crucial for maintaining its immunostimulatory activity. modification of odn <dig> with either organic molecules at the 3'-end or oligonucleotides at the 3'- or 5'-ends enhanced the stimulatory activity. this enhancement can be explained by the increased resistance of the odns to nuclease degradation. although it has been reported that free 5' ends in cpg odns with a pto backbone are required for the activation of tlr <dig>  <cit> , loss of activity in 5'-modified pd-odn <dig> in this study was attributed to degradation. when we modified pd-odn <dig> with 14-mer oligonucleotides at the 5'-end, there was still some potential to activate nf-κb, with some bands still present after serum degradation.

to further increase the immunostimulatory activity of the 3'-modified pd-odn <dig>  we next prepared a series of linked pd-odn <dig> sequences , which increased the number of cg motifs in each oligonucleotide. surprisingly, pd-odn2006-3'-b- <dig> led to higher activity than pd-odn2006-3'-a- <dig> at every concentration, which indicated that the linker sequence can affect the potential of cpg odns for nf-κb activation. finally, we removed the linker, generating pd-odn2006s such as pd-odn2006- <dig> and pd-odn2006-2006- <dig>  the enhanced potential for nf-κb activation obtained by cpg-odn2006- <dig> compared with odn2006-a/b- <dig> demonstrated that the linker sequences used in this study inhibited the activation of tlr <dig>  moreover, pd-odn2006-2006- <dig> showed much higher activity than pd-odn2006- <dig>  indicating that the number of cg motifs played a key role in the activity. to verify that the odn2006-linked sequences activate nf-κb activation through the tlr <dig> pathway, we applied pd-odn2006- <dig> into a 293xl-null cell line that does not express htlr <dig>  consequently, we observed no nf-κb activation in this cell line. therefore, pd-odn2006- <dig> is thought to indeed activate nf-κb through the tlr <dig> pathway. hence, these series of pd-odn <dig> sequences might be used as novel and effective tlr <dig> agonists.

to our knowledge, there are a few reports on nuclease-resistant immunostimulatory cpg odns with entirely pd backbones. lee et al.  <cit>  reported that the conjugation of poly-guanosine  sequences at the 3'-end of pd-cpg odns significantly enhanced tnf-α and il- <dig> production from mouse splenic dendritic cells. bartz et al.  <cit>  modified pd-odn <dig> with poly-g sequences and increased the cellular uptake and stimulatory activity of pd-odn <dig> in human leukocytes. they suggested that the increase in the activity resulted from the enhanced cellular uptake, which was attributed to the formation of odn tetrads, g-quadra structure. we also observed a supramolecular structure for pd-odn2006-g <dig>  as indicated by the presence of a high-molecular-weight band from agarose electrophoresis. however, no high-molecular-weight aggregate was formed for pd-odn2006- <dig>  atomic force microscopy also revealed that class a cpg odns with poly-g sequences form a particle structure, while class b pto-odn <dig> forms a linear structure  <cit> . clear bands of pd-odn2006- <dig> and pd-odn-2006-2006- <dig> remained after serum degradation, indicating that the series of natural pd-odn2006s preserved the potential for tlr <dig> activation due to enhanced stability. we also speculate that the increase in the number of cg motifs in the oligonucleotides played an important role in the enhanced tlr <dig> activation potential. our novel pd-odns demonstrated higher nf-κb activity in not only the 293xl-htlr <dig> model cell lines but also b lymphocyte cell lines  when stimulated with pd-odn2006- <dig> and pd-odn2006-2006- <dig> 

in this study, we examined the production level of il- <dig> because our cpg odns are considered to have the same linear structure, which is proved to activate only b cells but not dendritic cells that produce il- <dig> and type i interferon, as class b cpg odns  <cit> . our pd-odns also showed a higher potential for the production of il- <dig>  therefore, our cpg-odns are suitable for immunotherapeutic use.

CONCLUSIONS
the purpose of this study was to develop safe and effective cpg odns consisting of a pd backbone for htlr <dig> activation. our data indicate that 3'-modified cpg odns consisting of a pd backbone are effective at resisting nucleolytic degradation, and that the number of cpg core motifs strongly influence their potential as htlr <dig> agonists. in particular, cpg odns with linked pd-odn <dig> sequences  can act as effective and potentially safe agonists of htlr <dig> at low concentrations.
