BACKGROUND
the tumor suppressor p <dig> is recognized as a critical regulator of cell cycle progression and apoptosis, incorporating signals from dna damage and other cellular stressors to decide cell fate  <cit> . disruption of p <dig> activity through direct mutation or regulatory dysfunction is a demonstrated causal factor in a large proportion of human malignancies  <cit> . as a transcription factor, many of the functional cellular roles of the p <dig> protein are elicited through direct dna binding to sequence-specific cis-regulatory elements  <cit>  leading to the transactivation or transrepression of target genes. many of these target genes have been described through both computational and biochemical methods  <cit> .

evidence suggests a functional role for p <dig> in differentiation and development, particularly within the nervous system. while initial p53-null mouse models were described as phenotypically normal at birth with markedly increased tumor development later in life  <cit> , later studies demonstrated a proportion of p53-/- mice had defects in neural tube closure resulting in exencephaly  <cit> . in vivo measurements in p53-responsive lacz transgenic mice demonstrated elevated p <dig> transcriptional activity in the embryonic and early gestational nervous system  <cit> , while high levels of p <dig> expression have been described throughout the chick, rat, mouse and xenopus embryo  <cit>  through midgestation. p <dig> functional activity has been further implicated in the differentiation of neuronal precursors  <cit>  and is transcriptionally active within the nucleus of differentiating primary hippocampal neurons and oligodendrocytes  <cit> , while p <dig> is inactive and localized to the cytoplasm of postmitotic differentiated sympathetic neurons  <cit> . p <dig> transcriptional activity may be further involved in the differentiation of other non-neuronal cell types. transcriptional activity of p <dig> plays a direct role in embryonic stem cell differentiation by suppression of the nanog gene  <cit> , and can directly induce xenopus homebox gene expression  <cit> . involvement of p <dig> has also been shown in spermatogenesis  <cit> , eye development  <cit>  renal development  <cit> , osteogenesis  <cit> , immune development  <cit> , lung development  <cit>  and muscle differentiation  <cit> . despite data supporting the transcriptional activity of p <dig> protein in differentiation, few genetic targets have been described and fewer still within a neuronal context.

discovery of non-genotoxic mechanisms through which p <dig> protein may be activated within tumor cells harboring wild-type p <dig> remains an important therapeutic objective, both in effort to alleviate traditional off-target chemotherapeutic side-effects and to prevent the unpredictable mutagenicity characteristic of these therapies. wild-type p <dig> can be activated in several malignancies by treatment with nerve growth factor  <cit>  or pharmacologic agents  <cit> , occurring through mechanisms sparing cells from the concomitant genotoxicity following chemotherapy. recent evidence demonstrates that while p <dig> transcriptional regulation of target genes may be stimulus-dependent , promoter occupancy is generalized and may occur independently of the activating genotoxic stimulus  <cit> . whether this paradigm is also applicable to nongenotoxic p <dig> stimuli compared to dna damage-induced p <dig> activation is unclear. ngf-mediated p <dig> activation mainly results in decreased proliferative ability of tumor cells and not apoptosis  <cit> , raising the question of whether ngf-regulated p <dig> activity is distinguishable from other means of p <dig> activation like dna damage. while the mechanism of ngf-induced p <dig> activation is uncertain, inquiry into the transcriptional program following such activation is warranted to discern possible receptor-dependent p <dig> transactivational selectivity compared to genotoxic agents.

in the current study, the p <dig> transcriptional program was studied during nerve growth factor-induced differentiation of ectoderm-derived rat pc <dig> pheochromocytoma cells. a global chromatin immunoprecipitation-based screen was used to identify genetic elements bound to and regulated by p <dig>  treatment of pc <dig> cells with ngf induces differentiation into neuron-like cells marked by cell cycle arrest and neurite extension  <cit>  along with marked changes in gene expression  <cit>  and signaling pathway activity  <cit> . ngf-responsive p <dig> activity  <cit>  has a functional contribution towards ngf-mediated pc <dig> differentiation  <cit> , but a role in gene-specific transactivation has not yet been established. we hypothesized that marked accumulation of p <dig> protein within differentiating pc <dig> cells would be accompanied by concomitant transcriptional regulation of genes involved in differentiation and cell cycle arrest. furthermore, we hypothesized that genomic elements regulated by p <dig> during neuronal differentiation may be unique from those regulated during genotoxic stress and apoptosis. we now report that p <dig> protein is transcriptionally activated in ngf-mediated neuronal differentiation and describe its binding to a number of novel and previously unreported genomic regions as well as the transcriptional outcome of this binding. we identify and validate genomic targets of p <dig> activity within the differentiating neuron-like cell, and demonstrate selectivity between ngf-activated versus genotoxicant-activated p <dig> transcriptional activity in a select number of p <dig> target genes.

RESULTS
ngf induces activation of p <dig> protein within pc <dig> cells
pc <dig> morphologic changes and neurite extension consistent with differentiation were visible within  <dig> hours of ngf addition to the media and became marked over the course of  <dig> days . ngf-dependent differentiation after  <dig> days treatment in pc <dig> cells was evidenced by expression of the dopamine transporter, a marker for dopamine generation  <cit>  and transport, and decreased nestin immunoreactivity, indicating loss of undifferentiated phenotype  <cit>  . in agreement with previous reports  <cit> , cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry using fitc-brdu labeling of total and newly synthesized dna, respectively, revealed the population of cells within s phase was decreased to ~1% of the total cell population within  <dig> hours of ngf treatment . reduction of s phase cells was accompanied by a concomitant increase in the number of cells within g <dig> phase after  <dig> days of ngf exposure .

p <dig> protein levels were significantly elevated in response to ngf treatment in pc <dig> cells as previously described by others  <cit> . accumulation of p <dig> protein was detectable at  <dig> hours following ngf exposure and remained highly elevated over the course of  <dig> days . phosphorylation of p <dig> protein at serine  <dig>  which is typically needed for transactivation, began at about  <dig> hours after ngf treatment and remained highly phosphorylated throughout  <dig> days . accumulation of p <dig> protein can be attributed to protein stabilization since levels of p <dig> mrna remained unchanged over a 7-day course of ngf treatment . virtually all p <dig> protein was localized within the nucleus in  <dig> day ngf-differentiated cells, as determined by immunoblot of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions . accumulated p <dig> protein was transcriptionally active, as demonstrated by luciferase expression using the p53ta-luc reporter vector in differentiated compared to naïve cells .

the role of p <dig> activity in differentiation of ngf treated pc <dig> cells was investigated in anti-p <dig> shrna-expressing pc <dig> cells . three stable pc <dig> lines expressing different anti-p <dig> shrnas were created to observe p53-dependent function in pc <dig> differentiation. p <dig> rna silencing resulted in reduced p <dig> protein levels, with p53#3low having the lowest levels, followed by p53#2mid and p53#4mid. the p53#4mid cell line reproducibly expressed p <dig> protein levels approaching those observed in the wild-type cell. in combination, these three shrna cell lines formed a gradient of p <dig> protein expression compared to the wild-type cell. while no apparent morphological differences were noted in the shrna expressing cell lines maintained in the naïve state, ngf differentiation of these cells demonstrated reduced early neurite extension compared to their wild-type counterparts. within  <dig> days of ngf exposure, p53#3low cells had markedly reduced neurite outgrowth compared to wild-type cells , lasting up to  <dig> days . these results agree with prior work showing disruption of morphological differentiation following both dominant-negative and temperature-sensitive p <dig> transfection into pc <dig> cells  <cit> .

chromatin immunoprecipitation and cloning of chip-generated tags
p <dig> dna binding was studied in seven-day differentiated pc <dig> cells via chromatin immunoprecipitation  analysis. preliminary assay validation demonstrated p <dig> binding to a known, well-defined binding site within the p21waf1/cip <dig> promoter at a 2-fold greater level in differentiated versus naïve cells . greater than 10-fold increased p <dig> occupancy at the p21waf1/cip <dig> proximal binding site was detected with fl- <dig> immunoprecipitating antibody compared to igg alone, confirming antibody specificity . having validated p <dig> occupancy to a known gene promoter, chip-enriched dna from differentiated pc <dig> cells was amplified, concatemerized and cloned. cloned concatemers were sequenced and separated, resulting in  <dig>  individual dna tags representative of putative p53-occupied locations within the pc <dig> genome . tags were aligned to the rattus norvegicus genome and locations with > <dig> tag mapping within a  <dig> kb area  were identified. cluster chromosomal coordinates and sequences have been compiled and organized . sequence data were obtained for  <dig> bp upstream and downstream of each tag, single or clustered, and tags were recompiled to represent the original p53-bound chip-enriched fragments. since the number of sequenced tags were non-saturating compared to the total population of p53-occupied fragments, both clusters and single tags were potentially informative. tags representing putative p53-occupied genomic fragments were found to span the entire rattus norvegicus genome in addition to known p <dig> binding regions within the mdm <dig>  cyclin g <dig> and other known target promoters, validating this experimental approach for the study of other novel putative targets.

recompiled tag sequences were analyzed for predicted p <dig> binding sites using the p53mh algorithm  <cit>  and sorted according to both binding site score and location relative to nearby genetic elements. stringency for p <dig> binding site probability score was set at a cutoff of  <dig>  as determined by the p53mh algorithm using likelihood ratio scoring and a  <dig> base gap size limit between half sites. results using these criteria demonstrated  <dig> p <dig> binding sites within tag sequences located in upstream 5', downstream 3' and intergenic gene regions. of those tags with a p53mh binding site score ≥  <dig> , 56% mapped to within a gene, 25% to the upstream 5' region and 19% to the downstream 3' region . observed p53-occupied sites in the pc <dig> genome were visualized by plotting normalized tag alignment locations relative to a hypothetical gene size of  <dig> kb . scored p <dig> binding sites clustered to both the 5' and 3' gene regions, while intergenic binding sites were observed throughout the entire length of the gene.

validation of p <dig> occupancy and transcriptional regulation
we selected a total of  <dig> clusters and single tags combined for chip-based validation of p <dig> occupancy based on either the presence of a putative p <dig> binding site as determined by the p53mh algorithm, or tag location relative to a genomic element of interest. since tag sequencing and identification were not performed to saturation we considered individual tags and clusters as potentially informative. we recognized that selection based on high p <dig> binding scores alone may pose a constraint on putative regulated genes because p53-mediated transrepression can occur in both the absence of a consensus binding site  <cit>  or by binding to sites sufficiently distinct from the consensus sequence that fall below our accepted p53mh binding site prediction level  <cit> . a preponderance of genes whose known functions may be relevant in neuronal differentiation also factored into our selection of tags and clusters for validation. we selected  <dig> tags for chip-based validation based on criteria of ontological classification , known function of associated genes, or p <dig> binding site score in order to identify candidate p53-regulated targets with a role in pc <dig> differentiation. chip analysis demonstrated significantly elevated  p <dig> occupancy in an ngf-dependent manner for roughly 30% of the  <dig> studied validation targets. those targets to which p <dig> binding was significantly increased in ngf-treated cells are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  as expected, reproducible binding was demonstrated to promoters of known p53-inducible target genes shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> including p21waf1/cip <dig>  mdm <dig> and cyclin g <dig> . in addition to ngf-responsive genomic p <dig> binding sites, roughly 40% of targets showed significant p53-binding independent of ngf treatment . these targets were significantly enriched in chip validation when compared to negative control regions, although no ngf-responsive changes were noted in p <dig> binding. absence of ngf-dependent  <dig> binding to these regions precluded further analysis since they were beyond the objectives of this study. while these genomic locations were chip-enriched, cloned and demonstrated to be enriched once more in a validation chip experiment, further study will be necessary to demonstrate p53-dependent transcription.

in order to determine the transcriptional outcome of p <dig> binding to ngf-responsive target regions described above, rt-pcr was performed to compare mrna levels for indicated targets among naïve and differentiated pc <dig> cells . p53-dependence on target gene expression was verified using three stable anti-p <dig> shrna-expressing pc <dig> lines with varying p <dig> knockdown efficiencies. use of the three shrna clones formed a gradient of p <dig> mrna and protein expression , where p53#3low had the lowest level of expression and p53#2mid & p53#4mid were both reproducibly higher with a moderate level of p <dig> expression. including known targets, a total of  <dig> genes were p53-induced in differentiating pc <dig> cells. importantly, we discovered ten novel, p53-inducible targets regulated in an ngf-responsive manner , including the sesn <dig> and nme <dig> targets recently described to be p <dig> regulated either by association or indirect experimental evidence  <cit> . in addition, the dusp <dig> gene was an ngf-inducible p <dig> target, recapitulating earlier reports of this gene being p53-regulated  <cit> . further, we report four novel p <dig> gene targets that demonstrated a p53-dependent repression . these included the pkcbpb15/trib <dig> locus, where transcripts of both genes were elevated in p53-silenced cells. we also demonstrate eleven p <dig> occupied regions where transcriptional changes in nearby genes during ngf-mediated differentiation could not be accredited solely to p <dig> activity in the study , including the previously described p <dig> targets snk  <cit>  and nck <dig>  <cit> . additionally, new p53-occupied binding sites were identified for the mdm <dig> and dyrk <dig> genes, for which different p <dig> binding locations have previously been described  <cit> .

the majority of p53mh-predicted p <dig> binding sites within regions of validated occupancy contained either no spacer or a short spacer, in agreement with earlier data  <cit> . however, there are several notable exceptions to this trend including wnt7b, grhl <dig>  shmt <dig> and sesn <dig> binding sites, which contain atypical spacers from 5– <dig> bp separating the individual half-sites, similar to the described p53-binding site within the siah promoter  <cit> . consensus binding sites derived from our data are shown in figure  <dig> using the weblogo  <cit>  sequence analysis tool. we report little deviation from the p <dig> consensus sequence for transactivation  compared to repression except for the substitution of purine for pyrimidine at site  <dig> . this data supports the capability for p53-regulated transcriptional repression from a consensus binding site  <cit> .

stimulus-dependent transcriptional regulation
experiments were conducted to determine if p53-regulated genes in differentiation were unique from those following genotoxicity. expression levels of ngf-dependent p <dig> target genes measured after dna-damage by bleomycin and 5-fluorouracil were compared to ngf treatment to discriminate stimulus-dependency of p53-mediated transcription. as expected, expression levels for p21waf1/cip <dig> and cyclin g <dig> were elevated following all treatments, confirming the transcriptional activity of p <dig> in all groups . increased expression levels in three of the ngf-responsive targets, wnt7b, pkcbpb <dig> and lect <dig>  were not recapitulated in 5-fu and bleomycin treated cells. results demonstrate an opposite transcriptional regulation for these p53-regulated targets depending upon the treatment stimulus. although the absolute levels varied, expression levels and direction of the remaining p53-regulated target genes were similar regardless of the treatment . expression levels of all gene targets were similar to those found earlier using rt-pcr, with absolute differences attributed mainly to differential assay sensitivities. these data demonstrate that the gene expression at chosen time points for some, but not all, p <dig> target genes is ngf-dependent. the remaining target genes studied, however, were induced or repressed both by ngf receptor-mediated or genotoxic p53-inducing stimuli.

discussion
the p <dig> tumor suppressor is widely appreciated as a central node in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis in response to various genotoxic insults. its role within cellular differentiation, however, is uncertain. p <dig> has been considered non-essential to development since p <dig> null mice are viable and succumb to tumors rather than developmental malformations  <cit> . the discovery of low frequency neural tube defects in p53-deficient mice  <cit>  is an apparent paradox, suggesting the role of p <dig> in development may be more complex than initially believed. interpretation of developmental effects in p53-deficient models at the organismal level are complicated by the overlapping transcriptional functions of the p <dig> family members p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit>  which include such vital targets as p21waf1/cip <dig>  bax and mdm <dig> and likely other unknown target genes. in addition, regulation of growth control and apoptosis can also be carried out through p53-independent cellular mechanisms which could circumvent developmental defects in the majority of p53-deficient mice.

the marked accumulation of p <dig> protein and serine  <dig> phosphorylation levels suggesting its activation during ngf exposure led us to investigate a possible transactivational role for p <dig> in neuronal differentiation. using the pc <dig> cell model of ngf-induced neuronal differentiation, we hypothesized that p <dig> is involved in differentiation through specific transcriptional regulation of target genes. a contribution of p <dig> to pc <dig> cell differentiation is suggested by the reduction of neurite outgrowth observed during p <dig> knockdown studies described here, which is consistent with previous work showing similar findings using a temperature-sensitive p <dig> mutant  <cit> . however, we demonstrate p53-dependence for target gene transcription using three pc <dig> cell lines with varying levels of shrna-mediated p <dig> silencing, further enabling inference into the transcriptional sensitivity of each target gene to reduced levels of p <dig> protein. the 7-day time point of ngf treatment was selected for further analysis to explore p <dig> transcriptional activity at the time of highest p <dig> protein accumulation representing a stable timeframe of p53-dna occupancy following ngf exposure. as the chip-cloning approach utilized here is essentially a snapshot of p53-dna occupancy following  <dig> days of ngf exposure, it is interesting to consider that the population of p53-regulated gene targets may vary over time following ngf treatment.

here we describe a number of novel p53-occupied genomic sites within the ngf-differentiated rattus norvegicus neuronal pc <dig> cell line, and further identify corresponding genes regulated by p <dig> binding to these regions. the transcriptional targets described here represent enticing mechanisms through which pc <dig> cellular differentiation may be controlled by activated p <dig>  particularly interesting is the regulation of wnt7b and the tfcp2l <dig> grainyhead homolog gene. transcriptional regulation of wnt pathway genes by p <dig> has been described for several factors, including the negative regulator dickkopf- <dig>  <cit> , the transcription factor tcf- <dig>  <cit>  and beta-catenin  <cit> . until now, direct dna binding and transcriptional regulation of wnt genes themselves has not been previously reported for p <dig>  wnt7b functional activity is necessary for dendritic development and neuronal connectivity in hippocampal neurons  <cit> , consistent with the generalized lack of neurite extension observed in ngf-treated p <dig> knockdown pc <dig> cells in this study. the transcriptional regulation of wnt7b by p <dig> may be extensible to other cell types. for example, macrophage-derived wnt7b has been reported as an apoptotic initiator in vascular endothelial cells of the developing eye  <cit> , raising the possibility of p <dig> apoptotic control in immune cells through localized secreted factors.

the transcription factor cp2-like  <dig> gene, a rattus norvegicus grainyhead family homolog, is homologous to the grhl <dig> mouse and human family members. in drosophila, the grainyhead gene product participates in wnt-frizzled signaling in the establishment of wing planar polarity  <cit>  and in cuticle barrier formation and function  <cit> . the latter function is conserved in mammals, where grainyhead homologs are involved in epidermal stratification and wound repair  <cit> . the importance of the grhl <dig> transcription factor during development is underscored in the grhl3-null mouse, in which neural tube defects are prevalent  <cit> . absence of the p53-tfcp2l <dig> network in p53-null mice may represent a potential mechanism through which a proportion of these mice are born with neural tube defects. the role of grhl <dig> in ectodermal differentiation and specification into epidermal tissue and also within epidermal wound healing is strikingly similar to the demonstrated involvement of the p <dig> family member p <dig> in these events  <cit> . since p <dig> has an overlapping transcriptional program with p <dig>  <cit> , investigation into joint regulation of tfcp2l <dig> is warranted as a possible common juncture of in vivo redundant transcriptional control in development.

other transcriptional targets of p <dig> found in our study may play roles within the differentiating pc <dig> cell or developing organism. the nme1/nm <dig> gene is a positive regulator of neuronal differentiation through regulation of rb2/p <dig> expression  <cit> . the kctd  family, of which flj <dig> is a member, is involved in the left-right symmetry of developing zebrafish brain  <cit> . we found flj <dig> to be the most highly expressed p53-regulated gene in ngf-mediated differentiation. txnl <dig> is involved in p <dig> cardiac cell differentiation  <cit> , while brk promotes enterocyte differentiation  <cit> . the sdk <dig> neuronal adhesion molecule is involved in synaptic connectivity  <cit> . dusp <dig> is a negative regulator of erk signaling  <cit> , thus regulating mapk signal propagation. the lect1/chm <dig> gene, an anti-angiogenic factor in differentiating cartilage  <cit>  and a bone remodeling factor  <cit> , may be involved in bone development. furthermore, the additional unannotated p53-regulated targets described here such as flj <dig>  loc <dig> and loc <dig> may be important in yet unknown developmental, differentiation or signaling processes.

data from previous studies have reported a number of p <dig> regulated genes that do not completely correspond to expression changes observed in pc <dig> differentiation. this observation suggests that p <dig> transcriptional regulation in response to diverse stimuli shows similar gene expression but also some level of stimulus specificity. for example, our data show an overlap of p <dig> occupancy at some genomic loci irrespective of the p53-activating stimulus when compared to results from a recent chromatin immunoprecipitation/paired-end ditag  screen for p <dig> genomic occupancy in human colorectal cells treated with 5-fluorouracil,  <cit>  and another study identifying p53-regulated genes through microarray analysis from irradiated wild-type and p53-null animals  <cit> . we confirmed the findings of p <dig> occupancy at the snk/plk <dig>  <cit> , mdmx, nck <dig>  dyrk <dig>  p21waf1/cip <dig>  mdm <dig> and cyclin g <dig>  <cit>  regulatory regions but we observe p53-dependent expression changes only in the p21waf1/cip <dig>  mdm <dig> and cyclin g <dig> targets with ngf treatment. regulation of snk/plk <dig>  mdmx, nck <dig> and dyrk <dig> may not completely depend upon p <dig> promoter binding alone but also on availability of other transcriptional cofactors. since these targets were previously identified as p53-regulated, by extension, the genes we report as shmt <dig>  rnf <dig>  hmmr, trim <dig>  znf <dig> and ovary-specific mob-like protein may also be regulated under other p53-activating conditions. along with the ngf-dependent regulation of p <dig> gene targets described in our study as wnt7b, pkcbpb <dig> and lect, we believe that the p53-occupied targets shmt <dig>  rnf <dig>  hmmr, trim <dig>  znf <dig> and ovary-specific mob-like protein may provide additional examples of stimulus-dependent p <dig> transcriptional targets. interestingly, we did not find enrichment of p53-occupied loci in ngf-differentiated pc <dig> cells for mediators of apoptosis or dna repair  probably because these recognized functions of p <dig> are not involved in ngf differentiation. for instance, we did not observe dna repair genes, mlh <dig> and pms <dig>  found in a recent p53-binding genomic study through serial analysis of binding elements  in p53-expressing jurkat cells and verified in cisplatin challenged fibroblasts  <cit> . in addition, computational approaches combining chip, dna microarray with p <dig> sequence binding matrices have derived genomic maps of candidate p <dig> binding sites that reveal p <dig> regulation of a proapoptotic gene, bcl-g/bcl2l <dig>  <cit> , various coding and non-coding genes  <cit>  and regulation of micro-rnas  <cit> . by comparison, we show that ngf-directed p <dig> transcription in neuronal cells regulated several genes unique to differentiation and different from transcriptional targets previously identified in other p <dig> genome-wide studies.

ngf receptor-mediated induction of p <dig> activity through trka  <cit>  may represent a useful therapeutic avenue for development of non-genotoxic chemotherapeutics  <cit> . while activation of the p <dig> protein in response to ngf treatment within pc <dig> cells has recently been described  <cit> , it is less clear what particular signaling proteins are responsible for the marked increase in p <dig> protein stability and transactivational selectivity. changes in p <dig> activity are related, directly or indirectly, to trka activated signaling pathways, such as ras/mapk  <cit> . activation of the low affinity ngf receptor p75ntr by ngf results in apoptosis in schwann cells  <cit>  through the activity of p <dig>  <cit> . trka high affinity and p75ntr low affinity ngf receptors may represent a useful model through which the divergent 'choices' between cell cycle arrest/differentiation and apoptosis by p <dig> protein function can be studied. notably, ngf-induced pc <dig> cell differentiation results in little or no detectable apoptosis, despite markedly increased p <dig> levels and transcriptional activity over the extended time course of several days. it is thus likely that both the inducing agent  and cell type lend specificity to the p53-controlled transcriptional response observed for other p53-responsive conditions  <cit> . in addition, the continued transcription of mdm <dig> and cyclin g <dig> described here is in apparent opposition to elevated p <dig> protein levels following ngf treatment. mdm <dig> functions as the major negative regulator of p <dig> protein within the cell  <cit> , while cyclin g <dig> exerts its negative regulatory role through mdm <dig> dephosphorylation and subsequent stabilization  <cit> . however, continued stabilization of p <dig> protein during ngf-induced differentiation occurs despite the increased mdm <dig> and cyclin g <dig> rna levels shown here and maintained mdm <dig> protein levels . this suggests the presence of an intermediate event either inhibiting mdm <dig> function, or protecting p <dig> protein from mdm <dig> function, in differentiating pc <dig> cells. the incongruent time frames of activation for ngf-induced p <dig> compared to the relatively rapid stabilization via genotoxic agents further suggests the presence of a mechanism distinct from dna damage through which p <dig> stabilization and activation may occur during ngf-mediated signaling.

the approach used here in the identification of p53-regulated elements in neuronal differentiation represents a useful strategy amenable to the analyses of dna binding by other transcription factors. the recognized roles of ngf-induced p <dig> transcriptional targets identified in this report raise new prospects for a role of p <dig> in differentiation and development. further, we provide evidence demonstrating stimulus-specific selectivity by activated p <dig> protein in transactivation.

CONCLUSIONS
nerve growth factor-mediated activation of p53-depedent transcription represents an unusual example of receptor-mediated, non-genotoxic p <dig> activation. using a global chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning technique, we have identified and validated  <dig> novel transcriptional targets of ngf-activated p <dig> protein during neuronal pc <dig> differentiation. this study provides evidence of a functional role for p <dig> in differentiation.
