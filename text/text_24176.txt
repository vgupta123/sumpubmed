BACKGROUND
the role played by the dna sequence in determining preferred positions of individual nucleosomes has been studied using both experimental and theoretical approaches. several global assessments of nucleosome positioning have been described in yeast  <cit> , in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , in drosophila  <cit>  and in humans  <cit> . experimental mapping of nucleosomes has been performed mainly by micrococcal nuclease digestion followed either by ligation-mediated pcr analysis or by dna microarray-based methods. theoretical models used for nucleosome-positioning prediction include probabilistic models  <cit> , the comparative genomics approach  <cit> , the support vector machine classifier  <cit> , energy landscapes  <cit>  and dna physical properties  <cit> . during nucleosome formation,  <dig> bp in the central region of nucleosomal dna become primarily associated with 2-tetramer  <cit> . the histone particle presents, on its surface, a distribution of positive charges able to interact with their negative dna phosphate counterpart. these charges are symmetrically distributed with respect to the pseudo-dyad axis of the nucleosome and constitute a 'mask' of distances that remained constant during evolution  <cit> . it is usually assumed that dna length is the same for any dna sequence of the same size and that the helical rise of any dinucleotide step does not shift to a large extent from the mean value of about  <dig>  Å. more recent results, obtained by x-ray analysis of dna crystals, suggest helical rise values around  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å for a-dna and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å for b-dna  <cit> . we observed that dna oligomers having the same number of base pairs, as reported in x-ray and nmr databases, show different lengths, i.e., the length of dodecamers varies from  <dig> up to 37Å.

we guessed that nucleosome positioning must be related to a symmetric distribution of distances along the dna sequence upstream and downstream of the presumed dyad-axis location. in order to measure the length of dna sequences, as the sum of helical steps, we have collected from literature available helical rise values of the  <dig> possible tetranucleotide steps of dna.

RESULTS
helical rise values of tetranucleotides
a tetranucleotide code for the  <dig> possible tetrads was obtained collecting data from available databases of resolved dna structures . we referred each value to the central dinucleotide helical step, taking into account the first two flanking bases. for instance, we assigned a value of  <dig>  Å to actg tetrad, meaning that the central dinucleotide ct has such a value if it occurs with an a and a g as flanking bases.

columns report from the left to the right: sample number, sequence/reverse complement of the tetranucleotide, helical rise in angstrom units, root mean square deviation of the helical rise, name of samples used to retrieve data from nucleic acid database at http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/atlas. names in normal characters are from nmr database of dna duplexes, names in boldface are from nmr database for dna duplexes accommodating a modified base and names in italics are from x-ray database.

data reported in table  <dig> show a distribution of helical rise values with a mean of  <dig>  Å and a maximal and a minimal value of  <dig>  Å  and  <dig>  Å , respectively, with a remarkable difference of  <dig>  Å between these two values. thirteen of the values reported in the table were calculated by averaging values for tetranucleotides containing the same central dinucleotide step. for these tetranucleotides and  <dig> additional ones, whose helical rise values were derived by a single dna oligomer, rmsd values are absent. therefore, a refinement of the table is needed using new available resolvedstructures.

it is remarkable that tetranucleotides whose rmsd values are higher than  <dig>  Å have central dinucleotides that can be stacked, in the dna helix, into two different conformations; that's why they are termed 'bistable'. hunter  <cit>  reports evidence of bistability in dna bp, mainly in the pyrimidine-purine cg and ta steps, but also in cc/gg and ag/ct. a re-classification of bistability was performed by gardiner et al.  <cit>  in a study on structural parameters of dna oligomers, and, in tetranucleotides, the bistability turned out to be dependent of the central step according to gg, cg, ca > gc > ta > ag, ga, ac, at, aa order. therefore, we conclude that high variability of helical rise values for some of the tetranucleotides in table  <dig> is due to the presence of a central bistable dinucleotide step, which exhibits a high sensitivity to neighboring base pairs.

lu and olson  <cit>  have shown that the variation of helical rise values in dinucleotide steps is related to coupling of roll and slide values, i.e., when these parameters are both positive or both negative, dna either lengthens or becomes shorter. we confirmed this behavior and noticed as well that the influence of adjacent nucleotides on helical rise extends over the tetranucleotide, as shown in the two examples reported in table  <dig>  in the first example, tetranucleotide no.  <dig>  is reported; in the second one, tetranucleotide no.  <dig> . in gagc tetranucleotide, derived from sample 3kbd, we observed an increase in helical rise due to the substitution of an a with a g at the right terminal end and a corresponding change in roll from positive to negative. a similar increase is observed in the ctgc step derived from sample 1bdz. this result suggests that a hexanucleotide code would be more adequate for the evaluation of helical rise than a tetranucleotide code.

symmetric elements in the 2-tetramer
the central  <dig> bp of the nucleosomal particle ncp <dig> and positions of primary bound dna phosphates interacting with the 2-tetramer, mapped by richmond and davey  <cit> , are reported in figure  <dig>  the two dna strands are reported as w and c and the twelve distances li  and ri  localize dna segments we measured to assess the presence of a symmetric distribution of lengths. the maximal degree of symmetry Δls  is obtained when li = ri . we used the twelve segments reported in figure  <dig> and the corresponding distances as a mask to compute the probability for each base of a given dna sequence to represent a dyad axis. the mask in figure  <dig> covers  <dig> bp in the sequence and two additional bp are required to calculate the helical rise of the first and the last dinucleotide step of the mask, due to using of the tetranucleotide code. given, for example, a 100-bp sequence, we compute, using the mask,  <dig> values starting from the 30th bp up to the 70th bp of the sequence. the translation of the mask along a dna sequence implies its rotation through about 36°, which is required to follow the helical path of the bases. under these conditions, in our analysis of nucleosome positioning, translational and rotational phasing are coupled.

our purpose is to discover dna sequences in which equal distances are repeatedly inverted, such as in inverted repeats of nucleotides that occur in palindromes. we term these kinds of dna sequences "palinstases", based on the ancient greek word "diastasis" meaning distance. it is evident that palindromic sequences are palinstasic, but the number of palinstases is expected to exceed the number of palindromes, due to the larger number of possible combinations for  <dig> helical rise values of tetranucleotides, when compared with the  <dig> possible dna nucleotides.

symmetric patterns of nucleosomal dna sequences
we calculated the Δls values  for eleven synthetic dna sequences previously analyzed by fitzgerald and anderson  <cit>  in a study of nucleosome translational positioning. these authors mapped nucleosomal positions and determined nucleosomal stability Δg for each of their samples, including the Δg value of the nucleosome located on 5s rdna of lytechinus variegatus  <cit> . results from this analysis are reported in figure 2a. Δls curves exhibit either single, v-shaped, profiles with a minimum pointing towards mapped nucleosomal locations or profiles with multiple minimal Δls values. such minimal Δls values are always located, with an uncertainty of  <dig> bp in a few cases, above the positions of mapped nucleosomes, suggesting that their positioning is favored by a symmetric distribution of the distances in relation to the topology of the 2-tetramer. the variability of Δls values was tested on a sample  originally selected from a pool of synthetic random dna sequences  <cit>  for its strong nucleosome positioning ability. the presence of two sub-populations of nucleosomes in s <dig> and their relative abundance in solution, assessed by single-pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer, was previously reported  <cit> . in figure 2b the two mapped nucleosomal positions in s <dig> are reported. Δls values  exhibit a minimum that coincides with the first nucleosomal position on the left and several minimal values that are not coincident with the second nucleosomal position on the right. in the center of s <dig> sequence, at step  <dig>  we noticed the acgt tetranucleotide , which accommodates the central bistable dinucleotide step cg and has the highest rmsd value . for this step we substituted the mean value of the helical rise  with minimal and maximal values obtained from the available structures we collected; then we reported the newly generated Δls profiles . this substitution causes changes of about  <dig> Å in Δls value at the first nucleosomal position and a shift of about  <dig> bp for the minimum at the second nucleosomal position; this minimum, in new profiles, coincides with the mapped position. these changes can explain minimal Δls values of s <dig> and s <dig>  whose displacement from mapped dyad positions is probably due to uncertainty characterizing some helical rise values in table  <dig> 

minimal Δls values in figure 2a, averaged over curves characterized by multiple positions, were plotted as a function of the Δg value  and a linear relationship, with a correlation coefficient r =  <dig> , was obtained. this result indicates that the stability of nucleosomes depends on Δls in a linear fashion and that an increase in Δls destabilizes nucleosomes. interaction points on the 2-tetramer and interaction points along the dna-phosphate backbone can be less or more coincident. dna can stretch in order to reach a distant interaction point, can increase its curvature in order to interact with a back point or the insertion of bridging water molecules may occur. in fact, x-ray analysis of nucleosomal structure at high resolution showed that, inside the minor groove of dna strands, up to  <dig> water-mediated hydrogen-bonds can form  <cit> . it is evident that the substitution of an electrostatic bond with a weaker hydrogen bond of a bridging water molecule substantially destabilizes the nucleosome.

thåström et al.  <cit>  reported a sixfold increase in affinity for selected synthetic sequences when compared with the most natural nucleosome positioning. we obtained a similar variation of Δls values  ranging from  <dig>  Å, for the most stable synthetic sample, up to  <dig>  Å for 5srdna, which represents a stable natural nucleosome forming sequence.

the symmetric length-distribution in a given dna sequence can not be identified in a textual way, i. e., the sequence g40t30g <dig> is fully symmetric and supposed to have a Δls =  <dig> at the central tt step. this result seems to be in contrast with the observed low nucleosome positioning affinity of poly- tracts. actually, the Δls profile calculated for this sequence yields a minimum of  <dig>  Å, due to differences in helical rise between gggt, ggtt, gttt tetranucleotides on the left side and tttg, ttgg, tggg tetranucleotides on the right side of the central tt step. it must be mentioned that a Δls =  <dig> value can be attained by a sequence such as g40t59g <dig> and the minimum will be located at the central t.

we observed very low Δls values  for synthetic dna sequences, 150-bp long and characterized by the repetition of the 3nn3nn motif, as well as for  <dig> bp repeats. it has been shown that these sequences form stable nucleosomes  <cit> .

we calculated Δls for the sequences of two well characterized nucleosomal particles, ncp <dig>  <cit>  and ncp <dig>  <cit>  . ncp <dig> is a 146-bp long palindromic sequence derived from human α satellite dna, which yields an x-ray structure resolved at  <dig>  Å. ncp <dig> differs from ncp <dig> by a substitution at position  <dig>  and at the corresponding palindromic position  <dig>  and by an insertion of a g at position  <dig>  its x-ray structure is resolved at  <dig> Å. this substantial improvement of x-ray diffraction data was obtained upon the increase in the dna length by just one bp and it was observed that the distribution of interaction points between dna-phosphates and the histone core was the same for both ncp <dig> and ncp <dig>  ncp <dig> is not a perfect palindrome because two dinucleotide steps, aa and at, located at position - <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, are not reverse complementary . the sequence becomes palindromic at - <dig> and  <dig>  furthermore, by measuring each dinucleotide step with a tetranucleotide code, reverse complementarity is observed only starting from -3w and 3c positions. the measurement of Δ ls values  uses the convention of dividing the central segment, from position - <dig> to  <dig>  into two identical halves in order to make equal the segments l <dig> and r <dig> of the mask shown in figure  <dig>  the degree of symmetry of a sequence is, therefore, mainly based on contacts between phosphates and histones beyond positions - <dig> and  <dig> 

Δls values calculated for the two samples form curves very similar and symmetric with respect to the superhelix location   <dig> of the nucleosomal dyad axis . due to the difference between the two sequences at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  there are small differences on the left and the right side of the dyad, while a more relevant change occurs at shl =  <dig>  where ncp <dig> exhibits two positions with the same Δls value of  <dig>  Å in comparison to ncp <dig>  which has a single Δls value close to zero. this difference in the distribution of symmetric distances correlates to the different resolution in x-ray structures obtained for the two particles. the lower Δls value found for ncp <dig> suggests a higher degree of symmetry and a tighter structure in comparison to ncp <dig> 

archaeal nucleosomes
to further characterize sequences forming stable nucleosomes according to the distribution of Δls values,  <dig> synthetic sequences, selected for their ability to form very stable archaeal nucleosomes, were analyzed  <cit> . these particles are usually made of  <dig> dna bp bound to archaeal histones and resistant to micrococcal nuclease digestion. archaeal histones are characterized by the same fold as eukaryotic ones and their quaternary structures resemble 2-tetramers  <cit> . the analyzed sequences are 110-bp long and are formed by a variable 60-bp central core and by two identical lateral sequences of  <dig> bp. we show  the calculated Δls values for  <dig> representative samples, numbered according to authors' convention  <cit> . all samples were grouped together into four types:  <dig> samples named , with a symmetric profile and a low Δls value located at the center;  <dig> samples termed , with minimal Δls values displaced about  <dig> bp from the center;  <dig> samples termed , with a region of constant and low Δls values; and  <dig> samples termed , with minimal Δls values displaced by more than  <dig> bp from the center of the sequence. we report  the four mean profiles , ,  and , obtained by grouping the  <dig> curves derived from the samples belonging to the same type. the bp number  <dig> corresponds to shl  <dig>  the  <dig> - and the  <dig> - samples exhibit single symmetrical profiles centered at shl  <dig> and - <dig>  respectively. the pattern of the  <dig> - samples shows tracts that have almost constant Δls values and, consequently, multiple positions for the dyad axis. the  <dig> -samples have two positions corresponding to minimal Δls values, displaced about  <dig> bp from the shl  <dig> position. nucleosomal stabilities of all the  <dig> reported sequences are similar, probably because their recovery was performed at the same step of the purification process  <cit> . the four mean curves reported in figure  <dig>  exhibit a common minimal Δls value around  <dig> Ǻ, which, according to data reported in figure  <dig>  suggests a mean Δg-value typical of stable nucleosome positioning sequences such a 5srdna. distributions of minimal Δls values for each of the four mean curves are shown on the right of figure  <dig>  it is remarkable that minimal Δls values gather around  <dig> Å.

eukaryotic nucleosomes
we analyzed  <dig> sequences of eukaryotic nucleosomes, 146-bp long, cited in scientific literature as strong nucleosome-positioning sequences and with dyad positions mapped at the center of the sequence, as previously reported  <cit> . we show  the calculated Δls values for  <dig> representative samples, numbered according to authors'convention  <cit> . all samples were grouped together into four types, according to the same characterization used for archaeal sequences . as previously observed for archaeal sequences, minimal Δls values are mainly localized above the center of the sequences. due to the higher length of these samples if compared to archaeal ones, up to two minimal Δls values, which could represent potential dyad-axis sites, can be observed in the curves at a distance of about  <dig> bp. the four mean curves  exhibit very flat profiles when compared to archaeal analogous curves . this is probably due to the uncertainty of ±  <dig> bp reported in literature for this set of samples  <cit> . distributions of minimal Δls values  vary, in the four profiles, within the range 1- <dig> Å ; therefore, we consider these low values as representative of high stability in the considered nucleosomal eukaryotic sequences.

asymmetric dna sequences
we analyzed  <dig> synthetic dna sequences selected as refractory to nucleosome formation  <cit> . these samples range from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and the corresponding Δls profiles are reported in figure 6-. further  <dig> human dna sequences, 110-bp long, selected for the presence of dnase i hypersensitive sites  <cit> , were analyzed. the associated Δls profiles are reported in figure 6-. the studied sequences were grouped according to curve shape: panels  and  show profiles with an ascending slope, panels  and  accommodate curves with a descending slope and no slope is present in panels  and . most of these sequences differ from those forming stable nucleosomes, which always exhibited minimal Δls values in their center. in the  <dig> samples which were examined, we observed, in the central part of Δls curves, values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> Å. these values and profiles characterize regions having low affinity for nucleosomes.

nucleosomal stability at promoters
in figure  <dig> we report the Δls profile obtained from the dna sequence of 5s rrna  <cit> , with published nucleosome positions shown as black dots with  <dig> bp long horizontal bars. nucleosome mapping was made with micrococcal nuclease and dyad positions are affected by an uncertainty of ±  <dig> bp. we assumed the minimal Δls values as possible dyad positions of nucleosomes and marked them with blue dots having  <dig> bp long horizontal bars in order to visualize the extension of the sequence covered by the nucleosomes. we mapped the nucleosomes starting from the first most stable Δls value of  <dig>  Å that is found at position  <dig> bp. there are several other adjacent minima with similar values around this position that became excluded from the mapping so that the two experimental nucleosomes at position  <dig> and  <dig> can not be correctly predicted. we located the second most stable nucleosome with Δls value of  <dig>  Å at position  <dig> bp and the third Δls value of  <dig>  Å at position  <dig> bp. we obtained therefore two coincidences with published positions of 5s rrna sequence with an uncertainty lower than  <dig> bp.; a fourth and last nucleosome can be inserted either at position  <dig> or  <dig> bp with an uncertainity of  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp respectively. we must remember the variability of the Δls profile reported in figure 2b for s <dig> sample, where minimal Δls values could vary up to  <dig> Å and shift of about  <dig> bp in the presence of bistable dinucleotide steps. this reasonably precludes accurate mapping of nucleosomes by use of minimal Δls values. relative Δls values may instead be assumed as reliable indicators of nucleosomal stability when their measurements are based on a statistical approach. the Δls profile in figure  <dig> shows, upstream of the transcription start site , a region of about  <dig> bp with high Δls values and it is known that nucleosome free regions are always found in proximity of the tss.

we analyzed  <dig> dna sequences from promoter regions, experimentally identified,  <dig> kb in length. they belong to chromosomal genes of vertebrates and represent a set of not-closely-related sequences. we generated  <dig> random dna sequences that were processed the same way for comparison. mean Δls profiles of promoter and random sequences are presented in figure 8a. a region showing high Δls values is present in the promoter profile if compared to random dna. almost 50% analyzed promoters originate from human genome, hence nucleosome positions characterized, in human promoters  <cit> , with - <dig> and + <dig>  respectively, are reported for comparison. nucleosome free regions in proximity of the transcription start site have been reported in yeast  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , and humans  <cit>  and, in particular  <cit> , a lower stability of - <dig> nucleosome, when compared to nucleosome at + <dig> position, has been observed. according to our model, the highest point of the curve  is the best candidate for representing a nucleosome free region and is located between - <dig> and + <dig> nucleosomes at position - <dig> with respect to the start codon. the upstream region from this point shows a profile with a descending slope and can be considered a weaker nucleosome-forming region. + <dig> nucleosome is located downstream of the maximal Δls value and positioned under the center of a v-shaped and symmetric profile. the latter resembles many profiles we previously reported as preferred for nucleosome forming. these results indicate a preserved sequence-specificity of nucleosome binding in promoters of vertebrates. the agreement between our results and the experimental mapping obtained by dna microarray-based methods or computational algorithms supports the consistency of our approach, based on a very simple computation of symmetry. we also analysed dna sequences belonging to  <dig> human promoters  <cit>   <dig> bp upstream and downstream with respect to both transcription start and transcription termination site . using the same approach reported above a mean profile for each nucleotide was obtained and reported in figure 8b.

the result related to the region close to the tss shows the same profile identifying a low affinity for the nucleosomes around  <dig> bp upstream with respect to the tss.

a completely different scenario is reported for the region related to the tts. the plot clearly shows a very high affinity for nucleosome in corrispondence exactly with the predicted tts. it is remarkable that the extension of the v-shaped plot, corresponding to the potential identified nucleosome, has the extension of about  <dig> bp, the extension of a nucleosome.

CONCLUSIONS
we guessed that symmetric distributions of dna lengths could be related to nucleosome formation and suggested two novel ideas to test this hypothesis. first we used a tetranucleotide code in order to measure dna length and then we searched for symmetric distributions of lengths according to the frame inherent to the concept of palinstase. results previously reported show a linear relationship between nucleosome stability and symmetry measured by Δls values of known nucleosome-forming sequences. minimal Δls values in the profiles of several analyzed dna sequences were consistent with preferential nucleosome formation. the presence of many contiguous minimal Δls values  and of flat Δls profiles severely limits the use of our results for obtaining genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions. Δls values may instead be assumed as reliable indicators of nucleosomal stability when their measurements are based on a statistical approach. in human promoters we observed low affinity for nucleosome binding at the transcription start site and a high affinity exactly at the transcription termination site. in expectation of the acquisition of more experimental data on dna helical rise values, we consider our results as a preliminary assessment of the weight of dna length in nucleosome positioning.
