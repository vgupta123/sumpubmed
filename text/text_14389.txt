BACKGROUND
although bilateral vestibular pathology is an important cause of imbalance in humans, it is underdiagnosed and poorly understood. approximately 50% of dizziness is attributed to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo , a major risk factor for falls, bone fractures, and accidental death, particularly in the elderly  <cit> . the etiology of bbpv often relates to the degeneration or displacement of otoconia  <cit> , the minute biomineral particles in the utricle and saccule within the inner ear involved in detecting linear acceleration and gravity  <cit> .

currently, there are no known human hereditary vestibular disorders attributed to mutations in genes selectively affecting otoconial development or maintenance. otopetrin  <dig>  is one of a handful of known genes that, when mutated, cause an imbalance phenotype with selective otoconial involvement in animal models  <cit> . in the mouse, otop <dig> is expressed in the supporting cells of the sensory epithilium patches  of the utricule and saccule from embryonic day  <dig>  to adulthood, as well as in several other tissues  <cit> . in contrast, otop <dig> expression in zebrafish is predominantly restricted to the hair cells of the sensory epithelium and the neuromasts of the lateral line organ  <cit> . specific otop <dig> mutations have been reported in mouse  and zebrafish . despite the inter-species differences in otop1-expression patterns, mutant mice and fish lack otoconia and otoliths respectively in all cases, but otherwise have normal inner ear structures, hearing, and overall development. similarly, the knockdown of otop <dig> in mouse and zebrafish results in a phenocopy of the selective lack of otoconia/otoliths seen in the mutants  <cit> .

the otop gene family in most vertebrates is comprised of three members clustered on two chromosomes: otop <dig>  and the paralogous tandem genes otop <dig> and otop <dig> . the origins of the otop gene family have been traced far back in metazoans  <cit> ; for example, the phylogenetic relationships of vertebrate otop and arthropod and nematode otop-like proteins  have been deduced from  <dig> open reading frames in  <dig> species, demonstrating that they constitute a single family, named the otopetrin domain protein  family. fragmentary, but clearly odp-related, sequences have also been identified in urochordates , echinoderms , and cnidarians  . signature features of odp proteins are  <dig> transmembrane domains organized into three "otopetrin domains"  and a highly constrained predicted loop structure. although odp proteins do not show homology to any transporter, channel, exchanger, or receptor families, the extensive sequence and structural similarity among them suggests a conserved functional role  <cit> . it has been postulated that otop <dig> inhibits p2y purinergic receptor-mediated calcium release in macular epithelial cells in a calcium-dependent manner, and promotes an influx of calcium in response to atp during otoconial development  <cit> . in this model, otop <dig> acts as a sensor of the extracellular calcium concentration near supporting cells, and responds to atp in the endolymph to increase intracellular calcium levels during otoconia mineralization. otop <dig> and otop <dig> functions remain unknown.

the larger syntenic context of the otop <dig> and tandem otop2-otop <dig> genomic loci may reflect lineage-specific genomic features and gene associations worthy of exploration. for instance, established genetic and physical maps of the otop1-containing region suggest an inverted gene order in the mouse and human genomes  <cit> ; further, in these genomes, the otop2-otop <dig> gene tandem is physically clustered  with the usher syndrome  subtype 1g gene . ush1g encodes a scaffold protein with three ankyrin repeats and a sam domain, which is preferentially expressed in tissues containing motile cilia, such as cochlea and retina  <cit> . mouse ush1g on chromosome  <dig> and its human ortholog ush1g on chromosome  <dig> are mutated in the jackson shaker  mouse mutant and in human ush1g patients, respectively. the former is a recessive condition associated with deafness, circling, and disorganization of the hair cell bundles   <cit> ; the latter is also a recessive condition characterized by congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and prepubertal onset of visual loss   <cit> . ush is generally a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease and the most common cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans  <cit> ; invariably, ush is associated with highly disorganized stereocilia.

ush1g and otop <dig> thus play important roles in the vestibular , auditory , and visual  systems in vertebrates. in addition to the experimentally confirmed expression of ush1g in the mouse and human inner ear and retina  <cit>  and of otop <dig> in the mouse and zebrafish inner ear  <cit> , an otop-like gene  is expressed in the anterior placodal ectoderm area of the x. laevis embryo that forms both the eye lens and otic vesicle neurogenic placodes  <cit> . furthermore, analyses of expressed-sequence tag  databases reveal evidence for expression of otop <dig>  otop <dig>  and otop <dig> in the mouse and human retina. the challenge remains to establish whether ush1g and otop participate in common developmental pathways affecting ear and/or eye physiology.

to examine the evolutionary diversity of otop and ush1g and their larger genomic context in vertebrates, we performed a comprehensive comparative genomic study that analyzed  <dig> available genome sequences  and sequenced bacterial artificial-chromosome  clones from seven species. through cytogenetic and comparative genomic methods, we established that otop <dig> is the boundary gene of an inversion polymorphism on human chromosome 4p <dig> that originated in the common human-chimpanzee lineage more than  <dig> million years ago. we could further infer evolutionary scenarios for gene family expansions in individual lineages, including a three-fold expansion of the otop family in xenopus tropicalis and the ush1g family in fish lineages. ush1g genes have remained tightly linked to otop2-related sequences throughout vertebrate evolution, raising questions about whether they are functionally insulated or whether they participate in common developmental pathways. to further understand their functional organization, we deduced and analyzed a map of putative ccctc-binding factor -binding sites within the ushg1-otop <dig> locus. these analyses offer some hints about chromatin organization of the ush1g-otop <dig> locus in mouse and human, and are a resource for further investigating the role of mammalian insulator ctcf in orchestrating gene expression at this locus.

RESULTS
comparative sequence data sets
we sought to characterize the genomic regions encompassing otop <dig> and the ush1g-otop2-otop <dig> cluster in a diverse set of vertebrates. as the reference sequence for these studies, we extracted relevant portions of the ncbi mouse genome sequence , specifically, the intervals containing otop <dig> on chromosome 5b <dig> and ush1g-otop2-otop <dig> on chromosome 11e <dig>  plus the 100-kb segments immediately flanking each interval . the human sequence was an unsuitable reference because the human otop <dig> locus diverged significantly from the orthologous regions in most other vertebrate genomes .

we compiled the homologous sequences of these two genomic regions from  <dig> vertebrate species for comparative analyses . for seven species, we isolated  <cit>  and sequenced  <cit>  bac clones spanning one or both of the targeted genomic regions ; these efforts generated ~ <dig>  mb of high-quality sequence data  <cit>  specifically for this study. for the remaining species , the orthologous sequences were retrieved from whole-genome sequence assemblies available on the ucsc genome browser . with few exceptions , the generated data sets contain orthologous sequences of the otop <dig> and the ush1g-otop2-otop <dig> loci from multiple phylogenetic lineages.

evolutionary history of the otop <dig> locus in vertebrates
in  <dig> of the  <dig> vertebrate genomes studied, the immediate genomic context for otop <dig> is identical . for three of the remaining species , there were insufficient sequence data to draw firm conclusions about the genomic context of otop <dig>  in x. tropicalis, instead of a single otop <dig> gene, tmem <dig> and drd <dig> flank two closely spaced otop <dig> genes, which we have named otop1a and otop1b .

in our maximum likelihood analysis of the otop family , the otop1a-encoding gene resides within a clade containing the mammalian otop1-encoding genes, while the otop1b-encoding gene resides within a sister clade. a strict interpretation of this tree  requires the loss of an otop1b gene in the lineage leading to mammals. having the genomic sequence of the otop1-containing region of x. laevis or another amphibian might be useful for timing this genomic event . the x. tropicalis otop1a and oto1b genes encode predicted proteins that are 69% identical to each other at the amino-acid sequence level, and 72% and 65% identical to the mouse otop <dig> protein, respectively. otop1a more closely resembles mammalian otop <dig>  suggesting that, upon duplication, otop1b may have acquired novel functions.

the most dramatic difference in the architecture of the otop1-containing genomic region is in the human genome, in which otop <dig> is the boundary gene of a submicroscopic inversion polymorphism on chromosome 4p <dig>  in the inverted configuration , otop <dig> and drd <dig> are separated by ~ <dig> mb, with the break in synteny  occurring immediately adjacent to the 3' end of otop <dig> . all genes in this large genomic segment have the opposite orientation to most other vertebrate genomes studied.

the inversion polymorphism on human chromosome 4p <dig> was previously observed in a heterozygous state in  <dig> % of a caucasian population  <cit> . large  inversions are uncommon in the human genome; in fact, within euchromatin, there are relatively few greater than  <dig> mb. we thus sought to clarify the evolutionary origins of this inversion by comparisons with three non-human primate species serving as outgroups. the orientation of the otop1-containing region was validated by three-color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization   <cit>  studies involving a single human individual, five chimpanzees, three orangutans, and one macaque. to visualize the inversion, we selected two probes inside  and one outside  the inverted region. the presence of an inversion changes the order of the red and blue probes and their position relative to the green probe . these results demonstrate the inversion of the otop1-containing region in the human individual and in all chimpanzees sampled, but not in any orangutan or macaque studied, suggesting that the inversion might have occurred in the shared human-chimpanzee lineage and could still reflect a polymorphism in humans. it is not possible to establish the polymorphic or fixed status of this inversion in the chimpanzee lineage because of the small number of chimpanzees studied .

evolutionary history of the human chromosome 4p <dig> inversion breakpoints
the polymorphic otop1-containing inverted segment is flanked by ~260-kb duplicated segments, also referred to as segmental duplications . these are highly similar sequences  located near the otop1-proximal and otop1-distal inversion breakpoints at positions ~ <dig> mb and ~ <dig> mb on human chromosome  <dig> . the sds are oriented in an inverted configuration, suggesting that they originated by a non-allelic homologous recombination event. each sd consists of a mosaic of duplicated sequences originating from multiple chromosomes, most likely compiled in a step-wise fashion  <cit> . the immediate boundary region between otop <dig> and the otop1-proximal duplicon contains one retroposed pseudogene . both sd boundaries are enriched for olfactory receptor -gene sequences from the 7e subfamily  <cit> ; specifically, each cluster of 7e or sequences consists of one or more ~13-kb segment containing a 7e or gene interspersed with lines, sines, the ltr-containing satellite repeat satr, and herve retroviruses arranged in a characteristic pattern .

of note, the otop1-distal sd  lies immediately adjacent to the rs <dig> megasatellite, a tandem repetitive sequence containing copies of the deubiquitinating enzyme gene usp <dig> . bioinformatic analyses have revealed the presence of a less-conserved, minor rs <dig> locus on human chromosome 8p <dig>  which is relevant to our study .

we next analyzed a map of known sds in the primate genome  <cit>  to infer the evolutionary history of the otop1-flanking sd. as depicted in figure 4a , this family of sds, also called the tumor break-prone segmental duplication  family  <cit> , is specific to great apes, emerging and spreading out in hominid genomes since the divergence of the human, chimpanzee, and orangutan common ancestor from the macaque lineage, roughly 12- <dig> million years ago. all sds belonging to the tbsd family are >95% identical and have distinctive boundaries enriched in 7e or genes, ltr-containing retroviruses, and copies of the retroposed pseudogene Ψunc93b <dig>  the phylogenetic relationships among the 7e or genes have been studied by others  <cit>  revealing unique features, such as a high frequency of gene conversion with distant neighbors and evidence of inter-and intra-chromosomal duplication events. this pattern is distinct from the entire set of human sds, of which 86% duplicated intra-chromosomally  <cit> . collectively, these data support the idea that the highly similar 7e or gene clusters at the boundaries of tbsd family members may predispose to chromosome breakage and rearrangement; this likely reflects the history of the human chromosome 4p <dig> inversion described here. additional details about the tbsd family in primates can be found in additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

our analyses also revealed a second sd  in the human genome containing otop1- and tmem128-like sequences . here, the boundaries lacked the distinctive features of the tbsd family members. this small duplication most likely resulted from a typical duplication-shadowing event  <cit> . furthermore, oligonucleotide-based comparative genomic hybridization   <cit>  confirmed that this duplicated segment is present in single copy in human and gorilla genomes but, interestingly, not in the chimpanzee or bonobo genomes . this duplication pattern is inconsistent with the generally accepted human-great ape phylogeny; such a scenario may have arisen from a deletion event in the chimpanzee lineage, incomplete lineage sorting or, less likely, a recurrent duplication event in the human and gorilla lineages  <cit> . in the human genome, this 60-kb duplicon resides in the pericentromeric region of chromosome  <dig> . human Ψotop <dig> is 96% identical to otop <dig> at the sequence level, but contains multiple stop codons and indels ; it is thus unlikely to encode a functional protein. however, the promoter associated with Ψotop <dig> may still be active, as multiple truncated Ψotop <dig> ests exist in genbank .

evolutionary history of the ush1g-otop2-otop <dig> locus in vertebrates
the ush1g-otop2-otop <dig> locus spans ~ <dig> kb in the mouse genome . the tandem genes otop <dig> and otop <dig> have the same orientation and are separated by a  <dig> -kb intergenic region, while ush1g has the opposite transcriptional orientation. based on analyses of mouse ests, otop2-derived transcripts yield three alternatively spliced variants derived from the use of four non-coding first exons  as well as two internal splice sites in exon 1d and the non-coding portion of exon  <dig> . the presence of exon 1a, 1b, or 1c in an otop2-derived transcript is mutually exclusive of the others, while all transcripts share parts of exon 1d and the non-coding portion of exon  <dig>  consistent with its presence in all otop2-derived splice forms, exon 1d is highly conserved among vertebrates , and the exon's internal acceptor splice site is conserved across rodents, primates, carnivores, and ungulates. exon 1c is well conserved among vertebrates, with the exception of mouse and rat, which have divergent sequences but a conserved splice-donor site. finally, exons 1a and 1b show neither sequence nor donor splice-site conservation among vertebrates except in mouse and rat, suggesting that these exons may be rodent-specific. thus, ush1g is not adjacent to, but embedded within, the first intron of otop <dig> in rodent genomes due to the presence of lineage-specific otop <dig> untranslated exons.

an identical repertoire of genes near the ush1g-otop2-otop <dig> locus is present in  <dig> of the  <dig> genomes studied, including those encoding:  fatty acid desaturase domain family member  <dig>  nearest the 5' end of otop2; and  hypothetical protein  and cerebellar degeneration-related protein 2-like  nearest the 3' end of otop <dig> . the exceptions are platypus ; and xenopus and the five fish lineages .

the ush1g-otop2-otop <dig> locus is markedly different in frog and fish lineages compared to the other vertebrates studied. specifically, the x. tropicalis genome contains only one copy of the ush1g gene , but otop <dig> and otop <dig> are uniquely expanded into a cluster of six paralogous genes . a maximum likelihood  unrooted tree that includes all known amphibian, mouse, human, and dog otop sequences is shown in figure  <dig>  three well-supported clades representing the otop <dig>  otop <dig>  and otop <dig> subfamilies  are seen, indicating that the genome of the last common ancestor of placental mammals and amphibians  had at least three otop paralogs.

determining the timing of the otop duplication events is difficult. the tree in figure  <dig> suggests that the ancestry of otop1- and otop2-encoding genes may have been shaped by a combination of ancient duplication events and mammalian-specific gene loss. alternatively, our tree may be thrown off by to the asymmetric evolutionary rates of daughter genes following duplication and divergence--with the duplicate that retains the ancestral function evolving more slowly than the other . including additional x. laevis otop <dig> and otop <dig> sequences  may help break longer branches and clarify these relationships. on the other hand, the otop <dig> scenario seems to be more clearly a result of amphibian-specific duplication. furthermore, the topology of the two x. laevis otop3-like sequences  suggests that at least one of the otop <dig> duplication events occurred prior to the last common ancestor of x. laevis and x. tropicalis. notably, nlo is expressed within the non-neural ectoderm surrounding the anterior neural plate of x. laevis embryos; at tailbud stages, nlo is expressed in the dorsolateral region of the otic vesicle, which later gives rise to the gravity organs. given the phylogenetic relationship of nlo and otop <dig> as well as the apparent role of amphibian nlo, mouse otop <dig>  and zebrafish otop <dig> in the development of the vestibular system, it seems possible that the ancestral otop gene was involved in vestibular system development.

we examined whole-genome sequence assemblies for five fish species . we emphasize our analyses of the stickleback genome in figure 5c because its whole-genome sequence assembly included the best coverage of the ush1g-otop2-otop <dig> locus among fish. consistent with the whole-genome duplication that occurred in teleost fish lineage subsequent to its divergence from mammalian ancestors ~ <dig> million years ago  <cit> , the ush1g-otop2-otop <dig> locus occupies two locations in the stickleback genome. one segment  shows conserved synteny with other vertebrate genomes, with fads <dig>  ush1ga, otop <dig>  and c17orf <dig> similarly ordered and oriented . the other segment, residing on chromosome xi, appears to result from duplication and rearrangement events, yielding broken synteny among the genes ; this region is not fully characterized, but in the stickleback whole genome assembly it contains at least two otop2-related genes , one otop3-related gene , and two copies of ush1g . note that ush1ga and ush1gb  have remained close to otop-related sequences. a total of  <dig> ushg <dig> genes were annotated in the whole-genome sequence assemblies of the five fish . multi-species comparisons of the predicted protein sequences revealed that the defining architectural features of ush1g in placental mammals  are highly conserved in the three fish ush1g paralogs, with most sequence variation residing within the central region of the protein of unknown function .

conserved non-coding sequences within the ush1g-otop2-otop <dig> locus
we next set out to identify conserved non-coding sequences of potential functional relevance within the ~40-kb ush1g-otop2-otop <dig> locus. we analyzed the high-quality sequences generated from galago, dog, armadillo, cow, and hedgehog in conjunction with the orthologous mouse and human sequences from the ucsc genome browser. the x. tropicalis sequence was not included in this analysis because its unique otop family expansion complicates the alignment of non-coding sequences with other species' sequences. exactplus  <cit>  was used to identify multi-species conserved sequences  within the multi-sequence alignments. mcss overlapping known coding sequences were removed, thereby enriching conserved non-coding sequences. the resulting set of  <dig> non-coding mcss  together span  <dig> bp  of the analyzed interval.

to assess exactplus' performance, we compared its output with data from the "phastcons conserved elements, 30-way vertebrate multiz alignment" track on the ucsc human genome browser; this track depicts the top 5% most-conserved mcss based on phastcons analyses of  <dig> vertebrate genome sequences  <cit> . roughly  <dig> bp of non-coding sequence were identified by both exactplus and phastcons, accounting for ~ <dig> % of the analyzed ~40-kb interval. the first intron of ush1g, in particular, appears to contain a set of regulatory sequences with characteristics that are well conserved among vertebrates: a uniform intron size of ~ <dig>  kb; virtual absence of repetitive elements across species; and richer in highly conserved non-coding elements than the surrounding genomic regions .

an open question is whether there are non-coding sequences in and around the ushg1-otop <dig> locus that act as 'functional boundaries'- either to insulate these genes from each other or to orchestrate their regulation. chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing  combines chromatin immunoprecipitation of a dna-binding protein with high-throughput dna sequencing and mapping of the 'sequence tags' to a reference genome. an obvious candidate for organizing chromatin domains is the mammalian insulator ctcf. we thus mined data from in vivo genome-wide chip-seq studies in human and mouse es cells for ctcf 'sequence tags' that map to the ush1g-otop <dig> locus . four putative ctcf-binding sites  were found with the following species-specific occupancies: ctcf <dig>  and ctcf <dig> , mouse-specific; ctcf <dig>  human-specific; and ctcf <dig>  occupied in mouse and human es cells. notably, the binding of ctcf to ctcf <dig> has been replicated in all available genome-wide chip-seq studies, including resting human cd4+t cells  <cit> , five differentiated non-cancerous, karyotypically normal human cell lines , and a number of immortalized human cancer cell lines .

in silico analyses confirmed consensus ctcf-binding motifs within the sequence of all four ctcf-binding locations   <cit> . typical ctcf-binding sites are  <dig> bp long, with two conserved cores: one spanning bases 4- <dig> and the other bases 10- <dig> . furthermore, ctcf-binding sites can be grouped into low-, medium-, and high-occupancy sites  depending upon how closely they match the consensus ctcf-binding motif and the reported density of mapped tags. each class has statistically divergent features, suggesting distinct functional roles  <cit> . ctcf <dig> contains a highoc binding site that is highly conserved across placental mammals. statistically, highoc sites tend to be more conserved than their flanking regions, are ubiquitously bound by ctcf, and act as chromatin barriers less often than lowoc sites; however, paradoxically, they have a greater tendency to delimit domains of co-regulated genes  <cit> .on the other hand, ctcf <dig>  contains a lowoc motif. lowoc binding motifs demonstrate greater conservation in their flanking regions compared to highoc sites, and tend to be cell-specific, with ctcf-binding being more variable between cell types than at highoc sites. lowoc sites have been proposed to play a role in establishing chromatin barriers. neither ctcf2- nor ctcf3-binding motifs are conserved in non-placental vertebrates .

ctcf <dig> and ctcf <dig> are only occupied in mouse es cells. of note, the spacing of the cores within the ctcf <dig> motif was uniquely lost in human, chimpanzee, and gorilla due to the deletion of spacer base 9; otherwise the binding motif is conserved in placental mammals. also, ctcf <dig> contains a strong ctcf-binding site  in the mouse genome, although the binding motif is biased towards less-commonly reported bases  in other placental mammals.

discussion
in this study, we used comparative genome sequencing and cytogenetics to examine the evolutionary history and the genomic context of three otop genes in  <dig> evolutionarily diverse vertebrate species. we also extended our evolutionary studies to the ush1g deafness gene because of the tight head-to-tail physical clustering of ush1g with otop <dig> and otop <dig> in vertebrate genomes, and because mutations in otop <dig> and ush1g result in inner ear phenotypes in vertebrates. based on our analyses, we conclude that the evolution of the otop family in hominoids, amphibians, and rodents significantly departs from that of most vertebrate genomes, as does the evolution of ush1g in the teleostei fish lineages.

the most striking difference found between hominoid species and other vertebrates is that the otop <dig> locus is flanked by a large sd of high complexity and sequence identity, belonging to the tbsd family, and arranged in an inverted orientation. furthermore, otop <dig> sits only  <dig> kb away from the otop1-proximal inversion boundary. thus, the immediate genomic context of human otop <dig> differs significantly from that of mouse and zebrafish, the only other vertebrates in which otop <dig> has been closely studied  <cit> . therefore, information on regulation of mouse and zebrafish otop <dig> may not accurately reflect human otop <dig> regulation, and/or otop <dig> developmental and biochemical function in mouse and fish may be represented by another otop gene in humans. using cytogenetic and comparative genomic approaches, we examined the evolutionary history of the hominoid otop <dig> locus, including the flanking tbsd duplicons. our findings indicate that the tbsd family emerged at some point after the divergence of the human, chimpanzee, and orangutan common ancestor from the macaque lineage ~12- <dig> million years ago, and later underwent significant expansion . further, these sds contribute to plasticity and instability in multiple regions of the genome  <cit> .on human chromosome 4p <dig> we describe a large  inversion polymorphism flanked by palindromic tbsd sequences with otop <dig> as the boundary gene; this polymorphic arrangement, occurring in one in eight individuals of the caucasian population, likely originated in the common human-chimpanzee lineage prior to ~ <dig> million years ago.

our studies, combined with others  <cit> , have yielded a predicted timeline of genomic events affecting human chromosome loci 4p <dig> and 8p <dig> that have contributed to the structural complexity and genomic instability of the otop <dig> locus in humans; this timeline highlights interesting evolutionary parallels between these two regions. the macaque and mouse genomes are orthologous across the otop <dig> locus, meaning that otop <dig> and drd <dig> are tightly linked, with no evidence for the presence of 7e or gene clusters, complex sds, or rs <dig> microsatellite sequences. rs <dig> sequences are, however, present in the macaque region orthologous to human chromosome 8p <dig>  in orangutan, clusters of 7e or and rs <dig> sequences reside close to each other in both regions, yet there is no evidence for complex mosaic duplications or inversions in either location. chimpanzee  show increased copy number of the rs <dig> megasatellite on chromosome 4p <dig>  and evidence for significant expansion of the tbsd family across a number of chromosomes. furthermore, inversion polymorphisms of similar size  have been reported on chromosomes 8p <dig> and 4p <dig> in humans and chimpanzees.

the mechanism underlying such genomic rearrangements is not completely clear. one possible scenario is that flanking clusters of sds triggered the inversions via a non-allelic homologous recombination event . alternatively, rather than rearrangements being mediated by the duplications themselves, the inversions could have helped to create the complex segmental duplication architecture present at their breakpoints  <cit> . whatever the causal mechanism, the frequency of 8p <dig> and 4p <dig> inversion polymorphisms is relatively high in the human population, oftentimes with serious consequences for double heterozygotes. specifically, mothers who are double heterozygotes for the inversion polymorphisms on chromosomes 4p <dig> and 8p <dig> are prone to recurrent de novo t translocations through unusual meiotic exchanges, resulting in offspring with wolf-hirschhorn syndrome. the phenotype of patients with this syndrome consists of mental retardation and an array of developmental defects, often including hypotonia . it is conceivable that individuals broadly labeled hypotonic might also suffer from vestibular dysfunction, which could go undiagnosed because it is often not clinically assessed. it would thus be interesting to study wolf-hirschhorn syndrome patients with balanced t translocations in search of individuals with disrupted or dysregulated otop <dig> . the resulting physiological consequences could include complete abrogation of otop <dig> function, haploinsufficiency, elevated otop <dig> expression, or creation of a fusion protein with a dominant-negative effect or novel gain of function  <cit> , any of which would contribute to our understanding of the role of otop <dig> in human development.

x. tropicalis is the other vertebrate in which we found significant differences in genomic organization of the otop family. specifically, the x. tropicalis genome contains multiple paralogs for each otop gene. we have determined that amphibian nlo has a phylogenetic relationship to otop3-like genes. both nlo and otop <dig> are apparently involved in the development of the vestibular system in amphibians and placental mammals, respectively, suggesting that multiple otop genes may have roles in vestibular system development. studying the degree of sub-functionalization of otop paralogs in x. tropicalis may help to define the unique functions attributable to each paralog.

amphibians and other vertebrates share similar auditory and vestibular physiology, with their vestibular organs particularly well conserved in position, structure, and function  <cit> . however, a striking difference is the unusual calcium carbonate crystalline forms of amphibian otoconia. the general trend during vertebrate evolution has been a replacement of otoconial vaterite and aragonite crystals by calcite, a calcium carbonate crystal polymorph of increased stability  <cit> . such a trend correlates with the transition of vertebrates from aquatic to terrestrial life. chondrostei fish have vaterite and/or aragonite crystals, teleostean fish only have aragonitic otoliths, and both mammalian and avian otoconia consist exclusively of calcite crystals. during vertebrate evolution, calcitic otoconia appeared for the first time in the amphibian inner ear, yielding an intriguing intermediate situation with two crystalline forms: calcite in the utricle and aragonite in the saccule, lagena, and endolymphatic sac  <cit> .

the structural variation of otoconia among vertebrates is thought to result from different properties of their scaffold proteins. however, the main scaffold protein in amphibians, otoconin- <dig> , is produced in most portions of the developing inner ear , making it unclear how two entirely different crystalline forms of otoconia are regionally specified during amphibian development. therefore, additional factors unique to either the utricule  or saccule  likely lead to distinct regional nucleation and crystal growth during otoconial formation in amphibians. reverse genetic screens that might clarify the peculiarities of otoconial formation in amphibians have been impossible to undertake because animal models with clean, non-syndromic balance phenotypes are generally very rare  <cit> , to the point that frog mutants with complete otoconial agenesis have yet to be described. in this regard, a candidate gene approach involving targeted disruption of otop genes in x. tropicalis, individually or in combinations, could help discern whether different otop paralogs have acquired discrete functions contributing to the regional differences in otoconial formation; such a study could be performed using morpholinos, which have been successfully used to specifically examine the role of otop <dig> in vestibular system development in zebrafish  <cit>  and general otic vesicle development in xenopus  <cit> .

of the  <dig>  deaf-blind persons in the united states, more than half are believed to have usher syndrome , a combination of progressive retinopathy and congenital hearing loss. ush type i is especially devastating because of its early onset and extreme phenotype of profound congenital deafness with unintelligible speech, retinitis pigmentosa within the first decade of life, and vestibular dysfunction. ushig is one of five ush type  <dig> causative genes identified to date. those include the genes encoding the molecular motor myosin viia ; two cell adhesion cadherin proteins, cadherin  <dig>  and protocadherin  <dig> ; and two scaffold proteins, harmonin  and ush1g . these proteins are involved in a protein network or "interactome" within sensory cells of the eye and inner ear  <cit> .

our evolutionary studies of ush1g in vertebrates revealed a unique expansion of this gene family to include three members in all five fish species studied. a number of zebrafish models of ush have been described, including mariner , sputnik , and orbiter . our efforts have revealed that multiple copies of myo7a, cdh <dig>  pcdh <dig>  and ush1g are present in fish genomes . interestingly, there is evidence that the "ush interactome" may be more complex in fish than in other vertebrates  <cit> . specifically, the two pcdh <dig> orthologs in zebrafish have distinct functions in hearing and vision: pcdh15a is required for normal auditory and vestibular function, while pcdh15b is required for normal photoreceptor outer segment organization and retinal function. because ush1g is a scaffold protein, the presence of three ush1g genes in fish may affect the fish "ush interactome"  differently than in humans; such differences should be considered when using fish systems as general models for vertebrate ear physiology.

functional studies that shed light on the cis-regulatory elements and fine genomic architecture of the ush1g-otop <dig> locus are needed to establish the mechanisms underlying the lineage-specific differences in ush1g function. for instance, like human ush1g patients, the ush1g-defective mouse model js is profoundly deaf with vestibular dysfunction; however, unlike human ush1g patients, it does not have abnormal retinal phenotype  <cit> . it is notable that the transcriptional boundaries between ush1g and otop <dig> are indistinct in rodent genomes due the presence of two rodent-specific otop <dig>  5' untranslated exons that cause ush1g to overlap with  the otop <dig> transcriptional unit; the effect of this configuration on the expression of these two genes is not known.

ctcf is a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor that serves an insulator function to limit the spread of heterochromatin; it can also operate as a transcriptional activator, regulate nuclear localization, and participate in the control of imprinting  <cit> . the first intron of ush1g contains an extensive number of evolutionarily conserved sequences and is bracketed by two putative ctcf-binding sites, ctcf <dig> and ctcf <dig>  as a caveat, the predicted ctcf binding sites are based on positional information of sequence reads in chip-seq studies and need to be further validated. nonetheless, we suggest that the highoc ctcf <dig> site between ush1g and otop <dig> may be ubiquitously bound by ctcf in mouse and human, while ctcf <dig>  ctcf <dig>  and ctcf <dig> may participate in gene expression regulation in a cell- and/or species-specific fashion. further functional characterization of ctcf <dig> to ctcf <dig> will be pivotal for determining whether ush1g and otop are functionally insulated or participate in common developmental pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
distinct evolutionary events have affected the otop and ush1g genes in vertebrate genomes, particularly in humans and commonly used animal models . the lineage-specific evolutionary history of these genes may therefore limit the functional information that can be inferred from animal studies. in this regard, our findings should help guide the choice of which animal system to use when investigating otop and ush1g function. for example, sub-functionalization of the otop paralogs in amphibians may make x. tropicalis an appropriate model for exploring the organization, function, and regulation of otop genes and their role in inner ear development in vertebrates; and fish may be an effective vertebrate model for discriminating the different functions of ush1g, perhaps offering the ability to define the unique functions in inner ear and eye development attributable to each paralog. we also suggest that humans with chromosome 4p <dig> rearrangements should be studied for altered otop <dig> function, which may clarify this gene's role in human development.

this study also establishes a framework for defining whether and how ush1g and otop participate in common developmental pathways. future studies will focus on functional validation of the highly conserved non-coding sequences that were identified in the ush1g-otop locus, including four putative ctcf-binding sites that likely play a role in orchestrating gene expression at this locus.
