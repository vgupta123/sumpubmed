BACKGROUND
protein phosphatase 2a , one of the major serine/threonine protein phosphatases in the cell, is involved in the control of a large number of cellular events including cell growth, intracellular signalling, dna replication, transcription, translation, cell differentiation and cell transformation  <cit> . the key to understand how pp2a is capable of regulating such diverse, and sometimes even opposite functions, is its structure. the core of pp2a consists of a structural pr65/a subunit and a catalytic c subunit, both existing in two isoforms, α and β. to this pp2a dimer , a third regulatory b-type subunit can bind. it is generally believed that the regulatory b-type subunits target the phosphatase to distinct substrates and intracellular localisations. at present approximately  <dig> regulatory b-type subunits have been described. based on their primary structure, they can be divided into three families: pr55/b, pr61/b'  and pr72/b"  <cit> . they share two conserved a subunit binding domains   <cit> . in theory, about  <dig> different combinations of trimeric abc holoenzymes can be formed. how many actually exist in the cell, is unknown and most probably differs in different tissues due to the tissue-specific expression of some pp2a subunits  <cit> . furthermore, phosphorylation and methylation of the catalytic c subunit play an important role in the assembly of specific trimeric holoenzymes  <cit> .

in the present study, we focus on the regulatory pr72/b" subunit family named after the molecular weight of the first identified member  <cit> . in mammals, sofar  <dig> members have been described: pr <dig>  <cit> , pr <dig>  <cit> , pr <dig>  <cit> , ppp2r3l product  <cit> , g5pr  <cit>  and mpr <dig>  <cit> , all sharing a conserved region with two asbds important for binding to pp2ad. characteristically for this family, are – in addition to both asbds – two ca2+-binding ef-hand motifs  <cit> . mutation analysis of these ef-hand motifs together with several binding and activity studies indicate that ca2+ can influence the heterotrimeric assembly and catalytic activity of the b"-containing pp2a  <cit> .

pr <dig> and pr <dig>  the founding members of the b" family, are two n-terminal splice variants with a different tissue distribution pattern. pr <dig> is highly abundant in heart and skeletal muscle and barely detectable in other tissues. pr <dig>  on the other hand, has a more widespread distribution  <cit> . both splice variants have a role in wnt signalling since they both regulate naked cuticle  function, yet apparently in opposite ways  <cit> . furthermore, addition of iq- <dig>  a compound which disrupts binding of pr <dig> and pr <dig> to both pp2ad and nkd, results in prevention of embryonic stem cell differentiation due to a change of co-activators associating with β-catenin  <cit> . in addition, pr72-containing pp2a  is also responsible for the glutamate-dependent dephosphorylation of thr <dig> in dopamine- and camp-regulated phosphoprotein of  <dig> kda  in dopaminoceptive neuronal cells of the striatum  <cit> . pr130-containing pp2a  has been described as an interacting protein of cg-nap , a scaffolding protein that assembles several protein kinases  and protein phosphatases  on centrosome and golgi apparatus  <cit> . pp2at <dig> is also suggested to be involved in the calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of heart cells as it can interact with the ryanodine receptor type  <dig>  a heart-specific ca2+ channel found to be hyperphosphorylated in some patients with heart failure  <cit> . in xenopus laevis, an additional splice variant, named xn <dig>  has been found. this protein contains the specific n-terminus of pr <dig> followed by a short tail of  <dig> amino acids and thus lacks the asbd necessary for pp2ad-binding. consequently, this protein is not a regulatory pr72/b" subunit strictu senso  <cit>  but-based on its sequence-might compete in binding to other cellular partners of pr <dig> 

after identification of pr <dig> as a b" subunit family member which can bind cdc <dig>  <cit>  and therefore involved in regulation of the cell cycle, it was found that pr <dig> represents a partial clone of a larger human b" subunit, pr <dig>  <cit> . currently, two pr48-containing isoforms have been described with different n-termini: pr <dig> and ppp2r3l product. ppp2r3l product is mainly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle  <cit> , whereas pr <dig> is ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . recently, various links between pr <dig> and cell cycle progression have been discovered. pr <dig> can bind retinoblastoma protein , thereby regulating its phosphorylation status following oxidative stress  <cit>  and it can associate with cdc <dig>  <cit> .

another member of the b" subunit family is named g5pr. it has a wide expression pattern and can bind both pp2ad and pp <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, g5pr can interact with ganp, a dna-primase which is selectively up-regulated in germinal centre b cells after immunisation with t cell-dependent antigens  <cit> . b-cell-specific g5pr knockout mice display a decreased number of splenic b cells. this enhanced cell death, specifically induced upon antigen binding to the specific b cell receptor, is caused by an increased activation of c-jun nh2-terminal protein kinase and bim  <cit> . in parallel, t-cell-specific g5pr knockout mice display a decreased number of thymocytes. the enhanced cell death, mainly seen in cd <dig> and cd <dig> double positive thymocytes, is accompanied by increased activation of both c-jun nh2-terminal protein kinase and caspase- <dig>  but not bim  <cit> .

mpr <dig> is a mouse-specific b" subunit, discovered as an interacting protein of p <dig>  a rb related protein  <cit> . no human orthologue of mpr <dig> is found so far. it is expressed in various tissues and overexpression can regulate p <dig> phosphorylation, causing an increase of cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . furthermore, mpr <dig> co-purifies with the l-type calcium channel cav <dig> , a voltage-gated ca2+ channel important for ca2+ influx in cells of the cardiovascular system, heart and brain  <cit> .

undoubtedly, the generation of  pr72/b" knockout mice will be a valuable tool to obtain further insights into the potential physiological roles of the pr72/b" regulatory subunits. to provide a framework for the generation and analysis of such pr72/b" knockout mice, we present a comprehensive overview of the murine pr72/b"-encoding genes, their exon/intron organisation, their  transcripts and their developmental and tissue-specific expression. surprisingly and in contrast to the murine pr55/b  <cit>  and pr61/b'  <cit>  families of pp2a subunits, the murine pr72/b" subunits have evolved somewhat differently compared to their human orthologues. as a consequence the current pr72/b" nomenclature is confusing, and we now propose some changes to make it more consistent. at the cellular level, we determine the subcellular localisation of the major pr72/b" subunits and their ability to affect cell cycle progression upon overexpression. evidence is presented for at least one novel murine pr72/b" isoform, adding to the high diversity of pp2a b-type subunits.

RESULTS
the murine b" family isoforms
in mammals, four genes of the b" regulatory subunit family of pp2a have been described, giving rise to six isoforms: pr <dig>  <cit> , pr <dig>  <cit> , pr <dig>  <cit> , ppp2r3l product  <cit> , g5pr  <cit>  and mpr <dig>  an isoform sofar only found in mice  <cit> .

upon searching the ncbi database for murine b" family members via the blast algorithm, we retrieved the complete protein sequence of two murine pr <dig> isoforms: the human pr <dig> orthologue   and a shorter variant missing the last  <dig> residues  . in addition, one mg5pr isoform   and four mpr <dig> isoforms were retrieved: mpr <dig> as described by voorhoeve et al.    <cit> , two mpr <dig> variants containing different n-termini   and a mpr59/b"δ <dig> variant harbouring an alternative c-terminus  . additionally, two partial protein sequences of murine pr <dig> homologues were retrieved, one containing the first  <dig> amino acids of the pr <dig> specific n-terminus  and the other containing the last  <dig> amino acids of the specific n-terminus followed by  <dig> additional residues , resembling xenopus xn <dig> . of the full-length mpr <dig> , only a predicted sequence  could be found.

to confirm these in silico data and to get an idea about the abundancy of these clones, we scanned the ncbi database for murine est-clones containing the b"-specific n- or c-termini. only very few est-clones were found carrying the sequence of the mpr <dig> c-terminus lacking  <dig> residues , the xn73-like truncated mpr <dig> c-terminus  and the alternative mpr <dig> c-terminus , making it rather unlikely that murine b" family members containing these termini  do abundantly exist. in contrast, five est-clones of the specific n-terminus of mpr59/b"δ <dig> and multiple  est-clones of the other b"-specific n- and c-termini were found, suggesting that mpr72/b"α <dig>  mpr130/b"α <dig>  mg5pr/b"γ, mpr59/b"δ <dig>  pr59/b"δ <dig>  and pr59/b"δ <dig> are much more abundant, and probably represent the main murine b" isoforms.

since mpr59/b"δ <dig> and mpr59/b"δ <dig> are putatively novel, and to further confirm their existence, we performed a reverse transcription on nih 3t <dig> and murine heart rna using primer e <dig> annealing in the mpr <dig> 3' utr. with the resulting cdnas as templates and the use of five different primers, annealing with the specific n-termini of pr59/b"δ1– <dig>  and/or the specific c-termini of pr59/b"δ1– <dig>  and pr59/b"δ <dig> , we were able to generate several dna fragments, which after sequencing, were shown to correspond to pr59/b"δ <dig>  pr59/b"δ <dig> and pr59/b"δ <dig>  in vitro transcription-translation reactions of these cdnas revealed proteins of about  <dig> kda ,  <dig> kda  and  <dig> kda  , implying that not only the messengers of pr59/b"δ <dig> δ <dig> δ <dig> are present in murine cells, but that they can also be translated into proteins. a cdna for mpr59/b"δ <dig> could not be amplified using this approach, confirming its low occurrence in the est database.

a similar approach was undertaken to confirm the existence of the four mpr130/pr <dig> isoforms. in this case rt-pcr of nih 3t <dig> or murine heart rna led to the amplification of mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig> cdna, but not of mpr130/b"α <dig> or mpr72/"α <dig>  to confirm this at the protein level, we prepared protein extracts of murine embryonic fibroblast nih 3t <dig> cells and several murine adult tissues: heart, in which both human pr <dig> as pr <dig> are highly expressed  <cit> ; adrenal gland, the tissue from which the mpr130/b"α <dig> est-clone  was isolated, and brain. three antibodies were used to perform immunoprecipitations of the different mpr130/pr <dig> isoforms: a pr <dig> ab, raised against full-length recombinant human pr <dig>  <cit> ; a pr130n ab, raised against the recombinant specific n-terminus of human pr <dig>  and a peptide pr <dig> ab, raised against the first  <dig> amino acids of the human pr72-specific n-terminus. the results demonstrate immunoreactivity at  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda, corresponding to mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig> . no other specific bands could be observed, even upon prolonged exposure, confirming our in silico and rt-pcr analysis. consequently, it can be concluded that should the mpr130/b"α <dig> and/or mpr72/b"α <dig> isoforms exist, their expression would be very low or highly restricted in time and/or space.

together, six main b" family members are present in mice: mpr130/b"α <dig>  mpr72/b"α <dig>  mg5pr/b"γ, mpr59/b"δ <dig>  mpr59/b"δ <dig> and mpr59/b"δ <dig>  with mpr59/b"δ <dig> and δ <dig> being novel ones. a protein alignment of these murine b" isoforms  reveals that they all share a conserved region, harbouring both asbd and both ef-hand motifs, with the exception of mpr59/b"δ <dig> which misses  <dig> amino acids of the first asbd. they mainly differ within their n- and/or c-termini, which may be responsible for isoform-specific functions. surprisingly, no evidence of murine pr <dig> and ppp2r3l product orthologues could be found. the murine proteins most closely resembling these isoforms are pr59/b"δ <dig>  and pr59/b"δ <dig> .

genomic organisation of the three murine b" genes
an alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the murine pr72/b" isoforms suggests that all novel isoforms are the result of alternative splicing of the genes encoding previously described members. by blastn analysis of the murine genome using the murine cdna sequences, we could solve the genomic organisation of these three murine b" genes . the intron-exon boundaries were deduced by comparing the sequences obtained from the genomic clones and the respective cdnas. almost all boundaries were found to follow chambon's rule  for splice donor and acceptor sites  <cit>  .

nucleotides in uppercase represent exonic sequences while nucleotides in lowercase represent intronic sequences. bold letters indicate the exon-intron boundaries based on the at-gt rule.

the genomic organisation of the gene giving rise to the murine pr <dig> and pr <dig> isoforms  was deduced from clone rp24-308l <dig> , containing the entire gene. to retain the logic in the pr72/b" gene nomenclature, we propose to rename this gene into ppp2r3a, analogous to the human ppp2r3a gene. the mpr130/pr <dig> gene is located on chromosome 9f <dig> . this region corresponds to human chromosome 3q <dig>  where ppp2r3a is located. the mpr130/pr <dig> gene  spans approximately  <dig> kb and consists of  <dig> exons. in addition to the exons giving rise to mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig>  we could also locate both the exon containing the sequence of the  <dig> specific c-terminal amino acids of mpr130/b"α <dig> , and the exon responsible for the premature ending of pr72/b"α <dig>  at the correct sites within the gene. since pr72/b"α <dig> is the result of an intra-exonic splicing event within exon  <dig>  pr72/b"α <dig> might well be the result of a splicing error at this position, possibly explaining its low abundance. in the human pr130/pr <dig> gene , the exon responsible for the putative generation of a human pr72/b"α <dig> isoform is also present. the ncbi human est database contains exactly one est  containing this exon. in contrast, no sign of the specific c-terminal tail of either mpr130/b"α <dig> or xn <dig> could be found in ppp2r3a. in addition, no human est-clones were retrieved containing the pr130-specific n-terminus followed by nucleotides other than those of the common part of pr <dig> and pr <dig> 

to unravel the genomic organisation of the murine pr <dig> gene , we analysed ncbi contig nw_ <dig>  currently, this gene's symbol is ppp2r3a, but as one could easily mistake it for the murine orthologue of ppp2r3a, we propose to change its name into ppp2r3d . this gene spans approximately  <dig> kb and consists of  <dig> exons. the exons encoding the complete sequences of all mpr <dig> isoforms were found at the appropriate locations . to find the human ppp2r3d homologue, we scanned the human genome using the blastn program with the different mpr <dig> isoforms as input. the closest match was the human pr70/ppp2r3l product gene , followed by the human pr130/pr <dig> gene , confirming the similarity between pr70/ppp2r3l and mpr <dig> at the genomic level. therefore, the murine ppp2r3d and the human ppp2r3b/l gene may have evolved from a common ancestor gene. this hypothesis looks promising since to our knowledge no organism contains both a pr70/ppp2r3l product and a pr59-encoding gene. a phylogenetic tree, based on the protein sequences of various pr72/b" family members in man and mouse, further supports this hypothesis .

the mpr59/b"δ <dig> protein is not a genuine pp2aregulatory subunit
with the exception of xn <dig> and mpr130/b"α <dig>  all b" family members contain a conserved region and specific n- and c-termini. the conserved region, which contains two asbds and two ef-hand motifs, is necessary for pr65/a binding  <cit> . since the first asbd is not intact in mpr59/b"δ <dig> , we wondered whether this isoform is still able to bind pp2a. to this end, we made gst-fusion proteins of the main b" family members and overexpressed these in cos- <dig> cells. after a gst-pull down assay, we evaluated the binding of both the pr65/a and catalytic subunit of pp2a via western blotting. as expected, all main b" isoforms  bind pp2a , and are therefore genuine b" subunits. in contrast, mpr59/b"δ <dig> fails to bind pp2a, suggesting it is not a regulatory subunit of pp2a . like xn <dig> and mpr130/b"α <dig>  it might be involved in regulation of pp2a by competing with the other mpr <dig> isoforms for binding to other binding partners.

tissue distribution of mpr130/b"α <dig>  mpr72/b"α <dig>  mpr59/b"δ <dig> and mpr59/b"δ2
we determined the mrna expression of the genuine murine b" regulatory subunits via northern blot analysis . using an antisense probe which hybridises to the first  <dig> nucleotides of mpr <dig>  transcripts of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb were detected. these transcripts are probably generated by the use of different polyadenylation sites. however, we can not exclude the possibility that the  <dig>  kb transcript represents mpr130/b"α <dig>  both mpr <dig> transcripts have a similar expression pattern, being high in kidney and heart, intermediate in skeletal muscle, brain, liver and testis and low in lung and spleen. these findings are consistent with the previously published ubiquitous expression of human pr <dig>  <cit> .

a probe specific for the n-terminal sequence of the mpr <dig> isoforms, detected a single band at  <dig>  kb, likely corresponding to mpr72/b"α <dig>  similar to the expression pattern of pr <dig> in humans  <cit> , mpr72/b"α <dig> is abundant in heart and skeletal muscle and barely detectable in other tissues .

as for mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig>  the transcripts of mpr59/b"δ <dig> and mpr59/b"δ <dig> were visualised using probes hybridising with their specific n-termini. the expression profiles obtained reveal a wide tissue distribution with some minor differences between the two splice variants: mpr59/b"δ <dig> expression is high in heart and liver, intermediate in kidney, brain and skeletal muscle and rather low in testis, lung and spleen, while mpr59/b"δ <dig> is highly abundant in heart, liver, brain, kidney and testis and less abundant in lung, skeletal muscle and spleen.

these results, together with the earlier observed broad mg5pr expression pattern  <cit>  indicate a general high expression of all murine pp2a b" subunits in heart.

embryonic expression of the murine b" regulatory subunits
in order to generate viable knockout mice, it can be important to establish whether a function of the protein of interest can be expected during embryonic development, as a general knockout of such a gene might lead to an embryonic lethal phenotype. expression of the mpr130/b"α <dig>  mpr72/b"α <dig>  mpr59/b"δ <dig>  mpr59/b"δ <dig> and mg5pr/b"γ subunits was examined via northern blotting at embryonic days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . hybridisation was performed using the same specific probes as for the tissue distribution determination. for mg5pr/b"γ, a probe spanning the first  <dig> nucleotides of mg5pr/b"γ was used. no additional splice variants, specific for embryonic stages, were observed for any of the main murine b" subunits. expression of both mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig> transcripts increases as embryonic development proceeds. this might suggest a role for these proteins in fetal growth and development. in previous studies, both hpr <dig> as well as hpr <dig> have been reported to influence wnt signalling  <cit> . in contrast, the expression of mpr59/b"δ <dig>  mpr59/b"δ <dig> and mg5pr/b"γ remains constant during all stages of embryonic development .

immunohistochemical analysis of mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig> in different muscle tissues
all b" isoforms are highly expressed in heart. moreover, mpr72/b"α <dig> expression is nearly restricted to muscle tissue. mpr130/b"α <dig>  which has a broader expression pattern, is also substantially present in the different muscle tissues represented on the northern blot. since we have specific antibodies for both isoforms , we examined the distribution of mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig> in the different types of muscle tissue  in more detail via immunohistochemistry.

in longitudinal sections of skeletal muscle, mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig> both intensively stain the muscle fibers in a striated pattern . to evaluate whether these bands represent the i- or a-bands, we counterstained the sections with iron hematoxylin. this dye gives the a-band a dark blue colour and colocalises with mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig> . in one of the muscle fibers stained with mpr130/b"α <dig> ab, we could even observe a darker stained band positioned in the centre of the a-band . this band probably represents the h-zone. in sections of murine myocardium, a similar striated staining pattern could be observed in the longitudinally positioned muscle fibers. cross-sectional muscle fibers did not show staining of any specific structures . in bladder, neither mpr130/b"α <dig> ab nor mpr72/b"α <dig> ab stained the smooth muscle fibers of the muscular layer. in contrast, mpr130/b"α <dig> staining could be seen in the transitional epithelial layer, lining the inner cavity of the bladder . in none of the cases, specific staining of any structures was observed using pre-immune serum .

in conclusion, pr130/b"α <dig> and pr72/b"α <dig> staining seems to be a specific feature of the a-band striations of heart and skeletal muscle, whereas staining is very low or absent in smooth muscle.

subcellular localisation of the murine b" subunits
using gfp-fusion proteins, we determined the subcellular localisation of the hpr <dig>  mpr59/b"δ <dig>  mpr59/b"δ <dig>  mg5pr/b"γ and hpr <dig> subunits in cos <dig> cells. since the pr <dig> ab is suitable for direct immunofluorescence, we also evaluated the subcellular localisation of endogenous pr <dig> . as previously described  <cit> , hpr <dig> is mainly present in the nucleus . pr <dig> is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus . mpr59/b"δ <dig>  and mpr59/b"δ <dig>  appear both in cytoplasm and nucleus but are clearly less abundant in the nucleus than hpr <dig> and pr <dig>  mg5pr/b"γ is more abundant in the nucleus than the cytoplasm , corresponding to earlier published data  <cit> , and additionally is highly abundant in the cell periphery. surprisingly, unlike pr <dig>  <cit> , hpr <dig> has a more pronounced cytoplasmic expression . this diversity in observed subcellular localisation patterns demonstrates that each b" subunit may direct the phosphatase to distinct sites and substrates within the cell.

all b" subunits tested provoke a g <dig> arrest upon overexpression
several b" family members have been suggested to influence cell cycle progression  <cit> . therefore we analysed the cell cycle profile of hela cells upon overexpression of several egfp-b" fusion-proteins via facs analysis. compared to control cells , overexpression of all egfp-b" fusion proteins tested  caused an increase in the g <dig> population of transfected cells . this was even more pronounced in the presence of nocodazole, which arrests cycling cells in g2/m . these results confirm and extend previously published effects of hpr <dig>  <cit>  and mpr59/b"δ <dig>  <cit>  overexpression on cell cycle progression.

discussion
the importance of the b-type subunits for pp2a regulation can hardly be overestimated as they restrict pp2a activity spatially and temporarily within living organisms, thereby determining pp2a substrate selectivity and function. although the b-type subunits can be classified into three distinct gene families , their still increasing number, the sometimes confusing nomenclature and species-specific differences add to the complexity, especially for the non-specialist. in particular, for the pr72/b" subunit family the current situation may be confusing. with the aim to make this more clear and at the same time to provide a platform for the generation of b" knockout mice, we have presented here a comprehensive overview of the murine b" family members-in analogy to previous reports of the murine b'  <cit>  and b  <cit>  families.

in addition to the previously described murine-specific pr <dig> subunit  <cit>  and the murine orthologues of pr <dig>  pr <dig> and g5pr, we have identified two novel splice variants of mpr <dig> as members of the murine b" family. based on the genomic organisation of the ppp2r3d gene, we named the original isoform pr59/b"δ <dig> and the novel isoforms pr59/b"δ <dig> and pr59/b"δ <dig>  in contrast to pr59/b"δ <dig> and δ <dig>  no in vivo interaction of pr59/b"δ <dig> with pp2a could be observed. consequently, pr59/b"δ <dig> can not be considered as a regulatory subunit of pp2a. in addition, other potential murine b" family members  were found to be present in the ncbi est database. although genomic evidence for these isoforms could be found, our attempts to confirm their existence at either the mrna or protein level failed. this suggests that these isoforms are poorly expressed or might result from splicing errors. nevertheless, we can not exclude the possibility that their expression is missed because of a tight regulation or restriction in space and/or time. moreover, the existence of two b" isoforms  which do not interact with the pp2a core dimer, gives further support to the idea that b" subunits can exist- and be stable-independently of pp2a and that their function might extend beyond regulation of phosphatase activity as such . even if so far only minute amounts of these atypical unexpected messages could be detected, specific conditions might lead to an upregulation and possible functional consequences.

to our surprise, no murine orthologues of human pr <dig> or ppp2r3l product could be found. these gene products arise from the ppp2r3b/l gene, and according to the genomic organisation of ppp2r3b/l, we propose to rename these two n-terminal splice variants pr70/b"β <dig> and pr70/b"β <dig> respectively . several arguments suggest that the murine ppp2r3d gene  originates from a common ancestor of the human ppp2r3b/l gene , the canis familiaris ppp2r3b gene  and the xenopus laevis loc <dig> gene :  none of these organisms contain both the genes responsible for the expression of pr <dig> and pr <dig> isoforms;  these genes share the highest degree of homology amongst the b" members, both on the protein as well as on the genomic level;  from both genes, two b" regulatory subunits arise by using alternative first exons; and  human pr70/b"β <dig> can interact with and regulate the phosphorylation status of prb while murine pr59/b"δ <dig> can associate with and regulate the phosphorylation status of p <dig>  another member of the retinoblastoma family  <cit> . therefore, they may share some functional similarities. despite these similarities, we do not consider pr <dig> as the murine orthologue of pr <dig>  this is based on  the rather low sequence homology between the specific n-terminal regions of the different pr <dig> and pr <dig> isoforms and  the ubiquitous expression of both pr <dig> regulatory subunits in contrast to the skeletal muscle and heart-specific expression of hpr70/b"β <dig> <cit> . for these reasons, we suggested to rename the pr59-encoding gene ppp2r3d, instead of ppp2r3b. because of the diversity between mice and humans, it can be concluded that in contrast with the pp2a pr55/b and pr61/b' families, the pr72/b" family represents a less evolutionary conserved group of proteins. however, this does not mean that this family is not represented in lower species. pr72/b" members are also found in xenopus laevis  <cit> , drosophila melanogaster , caenorhabditis elegans , various plants , and some unicellular organisms , but are manifestly absent in yeast.

bold: main pr72/b" regulatory subunits

*: protein of which first a partial clone, pr <dig>  was discovered

unlike the pr55/b and pr61/b' family, the nomenclature of both the genes and proteins of the pr72/b" family members became very confusing. as mentioned earlier, we propose to change the murine pr72/b" gene names in such a way that the relationship with their human counterparts becomes clearer . as for the pr72/b" proteins, until now, most of them have been named according to their molecular weight . in this report, we would like to propose a nomenclature which is in accordance with the corresponding gene name and the organisation of that gene, and is consistent with the nomenclature of the proteins of the pr55/b and pr61/b' families. for historical reasons we prefer to keep the original and commonly known pr <dig>  pr <dig>  pr <dig>  pr <dig> and g5pr protein names combined with the b" indication and an additional specification  to denote the specific isoform. as such, b" proteins encoded by the ppp2r3a gene  will get the 'α' extension, followed by a number to designate the specific splice variant; b" proteins encoded by the ppp2r3b gene  get the 'β' extension etc. for the comfort of the authors and readers, once in a manuscript the subunit is clearly defined, the short names b"α <dig>  b"γ <dig> etc. can be used. in table  <dig>  a summary of the  murine and human b" nomenclature is given. if one intents to indicate the whole family, one can use pr72/b" as a common denominator since this makes an unequivocal distinction with the other b-type third subunits: pr55/b and pr61/b'.

we have also investigated the tissue distribution and developmental expression of all murine pp2a pr72/b" subunits on the rna level. taking together previously published data  <cit>  and our northern blot analyses, it can be concluded that mpr130/b"α <dig>  hpr130/b"α <dig>  mpr59/b"δ <dig>  mpr59/b"δ <dig>  mg5pr/b"γ and xpr70/b"β <dig> are ubiquitously expressed, indicating that these subunits are involved in general cellular processes. in contrast, mpr72/b"α <dig>  hpr72/b"α <dig>  and hpr70/b"β <dig> are highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and barely detectable in other tissues, suggesting a specific role for these subunits in striated muscle tissues. in fact, all b" subunits seem to be highly expressed in heart, an observation which is given the presence of two ef-hands in their primary structures and their regulation by ca2+ ions, of particular interest.

immunohistochemical analysis of longitudinal fibers of murine heart and skeletal muscle showed a striated pattern for mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig>  counterstaining with iron hematoxylin revealed that they both colocalise with the a-band. in contrast to the i-band, the a-band does not only contain thin, actin-rich filaments but also thick, myosine-rich filaments. mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig> staining is virtually absent in the smooth muscle of the bladder, suggesting that these subunits may play a specific role in striated muscle contraction only. although mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig> stain the nuclei in longitudinal as well as cross sections of heart and skeletal muscle, their nuclear localisation in these tissues is less pronounced compared to cultured fibroblast cell lines, probably due to their relatively high abundance in the contractile apparatus.

during embryogenesis no significant differences in expression from e <dig> until e <dig> could be observed for transcripts of mg5pr/b"γ, mpr59/b"δ <dig> and mpr59/b"δ <dig>  indicating that the expression of these proteins is not regulated during early embryonic development. meanwhile, mpr130/b"α <dig> and mpr72/b"α <dig> expression increases from e <dig> to e <dig>  this might imply a role for these proteins during early embryogenesis. alternatively, protein levels of these isoforms are simply building up for a more maximal expression during late development or after birth. in accordance with this increased expression during embryogenesis, depletion of xpr <dig> in xenopus embryos caused several severe developmental defects   <cit> . depletion of xpr <dig> resulted in milder developmental defects such as a disruption of somite organisation and an underdeveloped tail  <cit> . together these data provide valuable information that will aid in the development of suitable strategies to generate future b" knockout mice, as well as in their phenotypic analysis.

at the cellular level, we have also determined the subcellular localisation of the main murine and human b" subunits via expression of egfp-fusion proteins in cos <dig> cells  or via indirect immunofluorescence . a high diversity was observed: whereas pr130/b"α <dig>  pr72/b"α <dig> and g5pr/b"γ are predominantly nuclear, pr59/b"δ <dig> is equally well expressed in the cytoplasm, and pr70/b"β <dig> and pr59/b"δ <dig> are predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm. the latter observation further extends the relationship and functional homology between these two isoforms. on the other hand, the cytoplasmic localisation of pr70/b"β <dig> is in contrast with the reported nuclear localisation of its truncated pr <dig> form  <cit> , suggesting that nuclear import/export of pr <dig> isoforms may be a regulated event. further, putative nuclear localisation signals are predicted in g5pr/b"γ , pr130/b"α <dig> and pr72/b"α <dig> , but not in pr59/b"δ <dig>  pr59/b"δ <dig> or pr70/b"β <dig>  whereas a nuclear export signal is predicted in the common part of pr59/b"δ <dig> and pr59/b"δ <dig>  although the functionality of these motifs remains to be determined, their putative occurrence/absence fits quite well with our experimental observations.

upon overexpression, all b" subunits tested can induce a g1/s cell cycle arrest in hela cells, suggesting that this property may be independent of their subcellular localisation. the failure to proceed to s-phase may be related to the suggestion that many b" subunits play roles in dna replication  <cit> . however, the mechanism of this induced cell cycle arrest may equally well be the result of a dominant negative effect, such as for instance a competition between 'free' b"  <cit>  and trimeric b" for binding a substrate, or competition between b" and other b-type subunits for binding to pp2ad.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the murine pr72/b" family exhibits an equal complexity and diversity as the pr55/b and pr61/b' families of pp2a subunits, with three genes encoding nine isoforms/splice variants, of which at least five are abundantly expressed and give rise to genuine pp2a subunits. an important difference with the pr55/b and pr61/b' families however, is the poorer relationship between human and murine genes, which might indicate that the b" family is evolutionary more divergent. moreover, the diversity of pr72/b" members does not only originate from the number of isoforms, but extends to their specific tissue distribution, developmental expression and subcellular localisation. these differences add to the notion that no matter how similar their primary structures may be, different pp2a b-type isoforms likely display different in vivo functions. to explore these functions in mouse models remains an exciting challenge for the future.
