BACKGROUND
the human genome does not encode enzymes for the breakdown of dietary carbohydrates other than sucrose, lactose and a portion of starch  <cit> . all other complex carbohydrates form dietary fibres that by-pass the absorptive regions of the small intestine and provide a major source of nutrients for the resident gut microbiota. symbiotic microorganisms that reside in the human large intestine have the capacity to utilize and convert dietary fibres into simple molecules such as the short chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate that provide an important energy source to the host and additional health benefits . among the main dietary fibres , resistant starches have received the greatest scientific focus with nutritional studies aimed at determining the effect of resistant starch consumption on the intestinal microbiota and host health  <cit> . on the other hand, plant cell wall  polysaccharide components are much more difficult to study because of their molecular complexity and the difficulty preparing homogenous and pure fractions. this is particularly true for pectin, which is composed of as many as  <dig> different monosaccharides and more than  <dig> different linkages  <cit> . pectin is made of three major pectic polysaccharides, all containing d-galacturonic acid . the first one, homogalacturonan , is a linear polymer consisting of  <dig> -linked α-d-gala that may be both methyl-esterified and acetylated. the second polysaccharide, rhamnogalacturonan i , consists of the repeating disaccharide [/4)- α-d-gala-- α-l-rha- are attached to the l-rhamnose residues. the third polysaccharide bears the confusing name of rhamnogalacturonan ii , although it is a backbone of hg rather than rg, with complex side chains of rare sugars attached to the gala residues. structurally, rgi and hg constitute the ‘backbone’ of pectic polymers. however, another structure has recently been proposed in which hg is a long side chain of rgi  <cit> . rgi is the most heterogeneous of these three pectic polysaccharides because of its diverse sugar composition and the variation in length of sugar side chains whereas rgii is thought to have a highly conserved structure  <cit> .

it has been reported that around  <dig> to  <dig> g of pectins are consumed each day in a normal western diet  <cit>  and that approximately  <dig> % reach the colon  <cit> . yet, there is no clear-cut observation on the impact of pectin on the intestinal microbiota  <cit>  although dietary pectin consumption has been shown to provide health benefits to the host lowering cholesterol and serum glucose level  <cit> , with a possible functional role of intestinal microbiota in these benefits  <cit> . likewise, little is known on human intestinal pectin degraders and on the enzyme systems involved in pectin breakdown  <cit> . several bacterial isolates belonging to the bacteroides and faecalibacterium genera have been described to be able to grow on pectin as the sole carbon source . because of the molecular complexity of pectin, these bacteria must produce an arsenal of carbohydrate active enzymes . only one study has investigated pectinolytic enzyme systems in human intestinal bacteria and this was done on bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and bacteroides ovatus using a transcriptomic microarray approach. this study underlined the complexity of this fibrolytic function since several different polysaccharide utilization loci  were identified in the two species  <cit> . furthermore, recent studies have also investigated hemicellulose degradation by bacteroides species and have shown the existence of one and two pul dedicated to xyloglucan and xylans, respectively  <cit> .

consequently, the objective of the present study was to further investigate the pcw polysaccharide degradation by the human gut microbiota by focusing on the pectin enzyme system of bacteroides xylanisolvens xb1a, a xylanolytic species belonging to the human core microbiome  <cit>  that exhibits pectinolytic activities.

the genome of b. xylanisolvens xb1a encodes  <dig> glycoside hydrolases ,  <dig> polysaccharide lyases  and  <dig> carbohydrate esterases  . examination of the sequence-based family membership of these enzymes suggests that b. xylanisolvens xb1a might be able to forage on all major dietary polysaccharides, including starch, fructan, xyloglucan, β-mannan, xylan and pectin in addition to animal and fungal glycans including host’s mucins. predictions need however to be validated experimentally. for instance, b. xylanisolvens harbors cazymes potentially active on xyloglucan although it does not grow on this polysaccharide  <cit> . interestingly b. xylanisolvens encodes over  <dig> genes potentially involved in pectin digestion . in addition, in silico analyses of the b. xylanisolvens xb1a genome recently revealed the existence of approx.  <dig> polysaccharide utilization loci  mostly dedicated to dietary fibre degradation  <cit> . currently, citrus peel and apple pomace are the major sources of extracted pectin used widely in food industry as functional food ingredient   <cit> . therefore we chose these two types of pectins to investigate the pectinolytic function of b. xylanisolvens using a transcriptomic rna-seq approach associated with directed mutagenesis.table  <dig> list of cazyme families potentially involved in pectin breakdown and inventory of these cazymes in bacteroides xylanisolvens xb1a

citrus pectin versus glucose
expression profiling revealed that  <dig> and  <dig> genes were significantly over-expressed  on citrus pectin at mid- and late-log phase, representing  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of total genes in the genome, respectively . approximately half of these genes belong to the predicted puls described by terrapon et al.  <cit> . the other half encode genes involved mostly in bacterial metabolism . inversely,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were significantly repressed  on citrus pectin at mid- and late-log phase, respectively. most of them belong to pul  <dig>  possibly targeting inulin-type fructans and pul  <dig> . among the  <dig> puls predicted from genome analysis  <cit> ,  <dig> puls were more or less up-regulated on citrus pectin . of these induced puls, we retained the most up-regulated ones  which corresponded to six puls i.e. pul  <dig> , pul  <dig> , pul  <dig> , pul  <dig> , pul  <dig> , and pul  <dig>  . it occurs that these six puls contained cazymes potentially involved in pectin breakdown  and that they were differentially expressed according to the growth phase . as expected, gene over-expression was higher at mid-log phase than at late-log phase, but interestingly, several genes of pul  <dig>  exhibited greater expression at late-log phase than at mid-log phase .fig.  <dig> genomic organization of the six puls over-expressed on citrus pectin relative to glucose. the color code used for carbohydrate active enzymes highlights the nature of the main functional module: glycoside hydrolase , polysaccharide lyase  or carbohydrate esterase . pul marker genes, susc- and susd-like genes, are represented by purple and orange boxes, respectively, whilst the htcs regulator gene appears in light blue. other genes predicted as members of the puls are shown in grey except genes involved in sugar metabolism in red. genomic regions containing n stretches and/or unassigned genes are marked with a star

apple pectin versus glucose
only  <dig> genes were overexpressed  on apple pectin relative to glucose at late-log phase, representing  <dig>  % of total genes in the genome . pul  <dig>  was the most up-regulated and this pul closely resembles the locus encoding the starch utilization system in b. thetaiotaomicron . among the six puls identified in this study to be potentially dedicated to citrus pectin degradation, only pul  <dig>  and  <dig>  were up-regulated on apple pectin, but at lower levels than on citrus pectin . there were very few repressed genes  and they mainly belonged to pul  <dig>  and  <dig>  whose functions are unknown.

from these rna-seq data, contamination of apple pectin with starch was suspected and eventually confirmed by analyzing the composition of apple pectin and comparing it to that of the same pectin after amylase treatment and to that of citrus pectin . apple pectin contained  <dig>  % starch while amylase-treated apple pectin and citrus pectin contained  <dig>  and  <dig>  % starch, respectively. using amylase-treated apple pectin, the expression of all susc-like genes from the six puls highly induced on citrus pectin  as well as that of the susc-like gene from the putative amylolytic pul  <dig> was determined by rt-qpcr at mid- and late-log phase, relative to glucose. the data showed an up-regulation of all susc-like genes from the putative pectinolytic puls except for pul  <dig> and only at mid-l og phase . over-expression of pul  <dig> was still high at mid- and late-log phase.fig.  <dig> expression measured by rt-qpcr of susc-like genes from puls  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on amylase-treated apple pectin according to growth phase relative to glucose. b. xylanisolvens xb1a was grown on amylase-treated apple pectin and harvested at mid- and late-log phase. each bar represents the mean of three independent experiments



description of the puls dedicated to citrus pectin degradation in b. xylanisolvens xb1a
pul  <dig>  contains  <dig> genes transcribed from the positive strand  or the negative strand  of the genome . the cluster encodes one susc/d homolog pair, six glycoside hydrolases among which five are predicted to be involved in pectin degradation  and one polysaccharide lyase of family pl <dig> also active on pectin. no regulator was identified but the genomic sequence within this pul presents several sequencing gaps  with one particularly large region  that may contain the missing regulator.

pul  <dig>  is highly over-expressed on citrus pectin, especially at mid-log phase. from our rna-seq data , this pul is larger than initially predicted by terrapon et al.  <cit> : it should start at bxy_ <dig> instead of bxy_ <dig>  it contains  <dig> genes encoding one susc/d homolog pair, five glycoside hydrolases potentially active on arabinose-containing oligosaccharides , seven genes involved in sugar transport and metabolism and one gene with unknown function. five genes of this pul are also induced on oat-spelt xylan  but at lower levels  . as for pul  <dig>  the regulatory gene could be located in the sequencing gap of  <dig> nucleotides between bxy_ <dig> and bxy_ <dig> 

the three other puls  are localized in the vicinity of each other on b. xylanisolvens xb1a genome  <cit> . pul  <dig>  encodes  <dig> genes including on the negative strand of the genome the susc/d-like genes  followed by one gene encoding a protein of unknown function harboring a fibronectin-iii-like domain  . on the positive strand, various cazyme genes are present: one family gh <dig> glycoside hydrolase, a family ce <dig> and a two-domain ce12-ce <dig> carbohydrate esterase, and two family pl <dig> polysaccharide lyases. all the cazyme genes contained in this pul are described as pectin-specific. pul  <dig> also encodes a putative inner membrane-associated sensor-regulator of the hybrid two component system  family which is probably involved in pul  <dig> regulation. pul  <dig>  and pul  <dig>  correspond to clusters of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively and are interrupted by several sequencing gaps . they both contain three susc/d homolog pairs, one putative htcs sensor-regulator and several cazyme genes. thirteen from a total of fourteen cazymes encoded by pul  <dig> and nine from a total of ten cazymes encoded by pul  <dig> are most likely pectinolytic .

lastly, pul  <dig>  is also highly over-expressed on citrus pectin, particularly at mid-log phase, but its role in pectin degradation is unclear since it is composed of three genes of unknown function associated to one pair of susc/d homolog genes . no regulator was identified in this pul.

the rna-seq expression profiles were validated on one pul i.e. pul  <dig>  by rt-qpcr. gene expression profiles obtained in the different pectin conditions relative to glucose were confirmed except for the two consecutive genes  encoding family pl <dig> polysaccharide lyases .fig.  <dig> validation of rna-seq expression profiles by rt-qpcr targeting pul  <dig> genes in citrus or apple pectin conditions relative to glucose. differences in gene expression between the three conditions i.e. citrus pectin/mid-log phase, citrus pectin/late-log phase and apple pectin/late-log phase were significant for all targeted genes  except for regulation genes , and one pl1_ <dig> gene 



importance of pul  <dig>  in citrus pectin utilization by b. xylanisolvens xb1a
in order to confirm the implication of pul  <dig> in pectin utilization by b. xylanisolvens xb1a, we undertook mutagenesis of the single susc-homolog gene  in this pul. this gene was chosen because susc-like mutants have proven to be useful in establishing the role of puls in polysaccharide degradation by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron  <cit> . the preparation of an isogenic deletion mutant using the strategy described by koropatkin et al.  <cit>  for b. thetaiotaomicron was first tried but failed for many reasons, one of them being the very low conjugation efficiency in b. xylanisolvens xb1a . nevertheless a susc-like  insertion mutant was successfully obtained.

the pul  <dig> susc-like mutant exhibited normal colony morphology on agar plates and cells grown in liquid glucose complex medium had a similar shape as wild type cells under the microscope. the growth of the mutant was compared to that of the wild type strain on glucose, citrus pectin, apple pectin and amylase-treated apple pectin . both strains showed a similar growth on glucose. on citrus pectin, the growth of the mutant was strongly affected in comparison to the wild-type strain. on apple pectin, the difference between mutant and wild-type  strain was only noticeable at the end of exponential phase. nevertheless, with amylase-treated apple pectin, the growth of the mutant was affected, as observed on citrus pectin. the expression of pul  <dig> genes in the mutant strain was then analyzed upon growth on citrus pectin at mid-log phase . except for bxy_ <dig> , all pul  <dig> genes showed decreased expression in the susc-like mutant compared to the wt strain. moreover the three consecutive genes transcribed from the negative strand of the genome i.e. susc-, susd- and fniii-like genes  were much more repressed  than the other pul genes .fig.  <dig> growth of b. xylanisolvens xb1a  and pul  <dig> susc-like  mutant on glucose, citrus pectin, apple pectin and amylase-treated apple pectin. each curve represents the mean of three independent cultures

pul  <dig>  synteny with other bacteroides puls
given the importance of pul  <dig> to citrus pectin utilization by b. xylanisolvens xb1a, we searched for analogous puls in sequenced genomes from other bacteroides species. puls showing similar organization to pul  <dig> were found in bacteroides species phylogenetically close to b. xylanisolvens i.e. b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. caccae and b. finegoldii . as a matter of fact, the type strains of these four species are also able to grow on citrus pectin under the same culture conditions as b. xylanisolvens xb1a . several bacteroides strains with no species assignment also harbored an analogous pul in their genome. based on the percentage of identity  of the 16s rrna sequence of these strains with that of species type strains, we suggest that bacteroides sp. 2_1_ <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and 2_2_ <dig> belong to b. xylanisolvens and bacteroides sp. d <dig> to b. ovatus.fig.  <dig> evolution of the genomic region including xb1a pul  <dig> in closely related species. genomic regions and encoded genes are respectively represented as a central black line with boxes above or below to distinguish strands, with proportionality to genome/gene length. rearrangements can be visualized thanks to the presence of light-grey polygons between conserved segments of two distinct pul organizations. the color code used for carbohydrate active enzymes highlights the nature of the main functional module: glycoside hydrolase , polysaccharide lyase  or carbohydrate esterase . pul marker genes, susc- and susd-like genes, are represented by purple and orange boxes, respectively, whilst the htcs regulator gene appears in light blue. other genes predicted as members of the puls are shown in grey. two adjacent genes that are conserved in most species but only predicted as part of the active loci in the "longest" pul versions are shown as white boxes. the non-pul genes immediately flanking the pul region are shown in black boxes



among the bacteroides spp. harboring homologues of pul  <dig>  variations were observed, including several rearrangements, such as insertion/deletions of segments comprising one to ten genes. this was true even across strains of the same species. interestingly, the synteny of the flanking genes is highly conserved across all species despite various pul organizations. one feature could be retrieved from this pul comparison among the two phylogenetically close species b. xylanisolvens and b. ovatus. indeed, two pul architectures can be distinguished: the shortest version  found in b. xylanisolvens strains xb1a, sd-cc-1b, sd-cc-2a, 2_1_ <dig>  d <dig> displays two to three pl1-encoding genes and a single susc/d-like and htcs system, while the longest version  found in b. xylanisolvens strains as well as in b. ovatus strains includes four to five pl1-containing genes, two susc/d-like + htcs systems, and additional cazyme genes coding for one to two ce <dig> and one to three gh modules of family  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> potentially active on pectin.

discussion
this study was undertaken to elucidate the pectinolytic function of b. xylanisolvens xb1a, knowing that pectin is a natural dietary component found in fruits and vegetables and citrus and apple pectins are widely used in food industry  <cit> .

citrus pectin has been shown to be rich in gala  and to be highly methylated, indicating that it consists predominantly of hg  <cit> . its major neutral sugars are d-galactose, l-arabinose and l-rhamnose, indicating the presence of rgi branched with neutral sugar side chains like α-l-arabinan and arabinogalactan  <cit> . the monosaccharide composition as well as the degree of methylation of the commercial citrus pectin used in this study confirmed this description . b. xylanisolvens must then deploy enzymes targeting primarily hg and rgi. cazymes involved in pectin degradation must disrupt esterified groups  and neutral sugar side chains from the backbone, and also cleave the glycosidic bonds within the gala-containing polysaccharide backbones  and within the neutral sugar side chains  <cit> .

rna-seq transcriptomic analysis showed that puls  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> play a major role in citrus pectin breakdown . taking glucose substrate as reference condition, pul  <dig>  and  <dig>  were the most up-regulated with citrus pectin. pul  <dig> composition in cazyme genes  suggests that it targets homogalacturonan . homologous puls were found to be up-regulated on purified hg in bacteroides thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig>  and bacteroides ovatus atcc  <dig> , hence confirming this hypothesis   <cit> . b. xylanisolvens pul  <dig> encodes cazymes targeting l-rhamnose-containing  and d-galactose-containing oligosaccharides , suggesting that this pul could be dedicated to rgi. the organization of this pul presents similarities with a portion of pul  <dig> in b. thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig> shown to be overexpressed on purified rgi  <cit> . pul  <dig>  was less overexpressed on citrus pectin than pul  <dig> and pul  <dig>  its composition in cazyme genes suggests that it encodes enzyme that attack both the hg and rgi pectin backbone . pul  <dig>  and pul  <dig>  were particularly overexpressed at early stages  of b. xylanisolvens xb1a growth while pul  <dig>  was upregulated at late stages  of growth. although it is not possible to propose a role for pul  <dig> in pectin breakdown, pul  <dig> encodes cazymes potentially active on neutral sugar side chains since the three gh <dig> and two gh <dig> enzymes may target arabinose-containing oligosaccharides. in b. thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig>  pul  <dig>  whose organization is almost identical to pul  <dig> was indeed shown to be induced on arabinans  <cit> . the fact that pul  <dig>  are overexpressed at early stages of bacterial growth suggests that the targeted oligosaccharides are the most accessible pectin moieties and/or the easiest to hydrolyze. finally, we assume that pul  <dig> targets the most resistant pectin polysaccharide rgii. this assumption is based on the fact that pul  <dig> is homologous to pul  <dig> which is up-regulated on purified rgii in b. thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig>  <cit> . actually, pul  <dig> is overexpressed at late stages of b. xylanisolvens growth, once the easy hydrolysable pectic molecules i.e. hg and rgi have been consumed and rendered less available. also, pul  <dig> encodes a gh <dig> enzyme putatively able to attack the complex side chains of rare sugars in rgii , enzyme that is not present in the other puls.

like citrus pectin, apple pectin contains more than  <dig> % of highly-methylated hg  <cit> , and this was confirmed by the analysis of the commercial citrus and apple pectins used in this study. the difference between the two pectins may reside in the rhamnogalacturonans, with longer rgi regions in apple pectin and higher content in neutral sugars  <cit> . also, several articles on apple pectin have reported contamination by co-extracted starch  <cit> . a contamination with  <dig>  % starch was found in the apple pectin used in this study and may explain the fact that pul  <dig> was the most overexpressed pul by b. xylanisolvens on this substrate. indeed, this pul must encode a starch utilization system considering its homology with the starch utilization locus  described in b. thetaiotaomicron  <cit> . otherwise, pul  <dig> and  <dig> were also up-regulated with apple pectin, as observed with citrus pectin, although the intensity of the response was lower on apple pectin, probably because the bacterium also consumed starch.

once treated with amylases, the composition of apple pectin was very similar to that of citrus pectin if we consider their content in gala, rhamnose, galactose and the degree of methylation. nevertheless, apple pectin contained two-fold less arabinose, three-fold more glucose and five-fold more xylose than citrus pectin, suggesting a lower extent in arabinan side chains and a residual contamination with starch and pcw polysaccharide moieties. using this amylase-treated apple pectin, and through the analysis of the relative expression of susc-like genes, we validated the induction of five puls over the six puls identified with citrus pectin and confirmed their involvement in pectin-utilization by b. xylanisolvens xb1a.

overall, this transcriptomic study using both rna-seq and rt-qpcr data obtained with two pectin sources and at two stages of bacterial growth, pointed to two overexpressed puls i.e.  <dig>  and  <dig>  that we assumed targeted hg and rgi, respectively. considering that hg is the most abundant moiety within pectin, pul  <dig> must therefore play a major role in pectin deconstruction. to confirm this hypothesis, pul  <dig> was mutated on the susc-like gene, which encodes a membrane tonb-dependent transporter allowing internalization of pectic oligomers within the bacterial periplasm, and hence the mutation is expected to block substrate utilization by the bacterium  <cit> . the analysis of the mutant in comparison to the wild type strain confirmed our hypothesis since the growth of the mutant on citrus pectin and amylase-treated apple pectin was strongly affected, both in rate and density. however growth was not completely abolished, suggesting that the bacterium could still utilize pectin moieties by means of the other enzyme systems possibly encoded by the other puls highlighted in our study . performing deletion mutagenesis of all putative pectinolytic puls identified in this study would have been ideal to better comprehend their role but this was not possible because b. xylanisovens xb1a was particularly recalcitrant to genetic manipulation. with untreated apple pectin as substrate, the mutant growth was only affected during stationary phase, possibly because it preferentially used contaminating starch and started to hydrolyze pectin only when the medium was depleted in starch. this observation highlights the adaptive capacity of b. xylanisolvens in utilizing mixtures of plant polysaccharides. nevertheless, starch contamination prevented us from comparing thoroughly the rna-seq transcriptomic profiles of b. xylanisolvens on apple and citrus pectins. as a consequence, caution must be taken when using so called “purified” apple pectins when the objective is to screen for pectinolytic bacteria and to analyze pectinolytic function.

to better understand the mutant phenotype, we analyzed pul  <dig>  gene expression in the mutant grown on citrus pectin in comparison to the wild type strain. plasmid insertion into the susc-like gene  blocked the expression not only of that gene but also of the two downstream genes i.e. susd-like  and fniii-like genes , suggesting that these three genes form an operon. this is supported by short  intergenic distances and operon prediction using rockhopper v.  <dig>   <cit> . moreover, except for the gene encoding the sensor/regulator protein , the other pul  <dig> genes were also slightly repressed in the mutant. this overall repression is probably due to the fact that the sensor/regulator protein, usually located in the cytoplasmic membrane, was not activated by hg oligosaccharides that could not enter the periplasm through the susc-like transporter.

finally, this study showed the architectural complexity of homogalacturonan-targeting puls in bacteroides which highlights important inter- and intra-species genetic rearrangements. nevertheless, within the b. xylanisolvens species, two distinct pul architectures were identified with strains harboring a short pul analogous to pul  <dig> , and other strains harboring a long pul consisting of a pul 49-like segment and of another pul segment, as in b. ovatus. a question is whether the acquisition or loss of this pul segment has functional repercussions in terms of efficiency of pectin utilization and/or in terms of adaptability to structurally-different pectins. only interaction studies between bacteroides species harboring different puls in response to well characterized  pectin from various plants will allow us to answer this question. of course, wider functional and ecological studies are needed to understand how dietary fibers and especially pcw polysaccharides drive the composition and metabolism of the fibrolytic community within the intestinal microbial ecosystem. in the long term, such studies would provide valuable information aiming at maintaining a healthy gut microbiota or rebalancing a disturbed microbiota through diets enriched in specific pcw polysaccharides.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows the existence of six puls involved in pectin degradation by b. xylanisolvens xb1a, one of them being particularly important in this function. this species deploys a very complex enzymatic machinery that probably reflects the structural complexity of this dietary fibre. our findings highlight the metabolic plasticity of b. xylanisolvens towards non-starch dietary polysaccharides which contributes to its competitive fitness within the human gut ecosystem.
