BACKGROUND
hibernation is an adaptive strategy involving regulated metabolic suppression used by taxonomically diverse mammalian species to conserve energy during periods of low food availability  <cit> . the molecular and genetic basis of hibernation physiology in mammals has only recently been studied using large scale genomic approaches. genome-wide approaches reveal the significance of transcriptional changes by identifying functional groups of co-regulated differentially expressed genes within metabolic and signaling pathways. recent studies of differential gene expression at the genomic scale on several species of small hibernating mammals have detected expression changes for hundreds of genes and identified groups of co-regulated genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, detoxification, and molecular transport when comparing animals sampled in different stages during hibernation and non-hibernating periods  <cit> .

the black bear  provides a distinct example of hibernation in mammals. unlike small animals  such as hamsters, ground squirrels, and marmots, that reach body temperatures near 0°c during torpor, hibernating black bears  maintain core body temperatures above 30°c  <cit>  and remain capable of moving throughout hibernation  <cit> . bears do not eat, drink, defecate, or urinate throughout a 3- <dig> month hibernation season  <cit> . heart rate in hibernating bears decreases from  <dig> bpm to  <dig> bpm  <cit> . metabolic rate in hibernating bears is reduced by 20-50%, and it takes several weeks after emergence for metabolic rate to return to normal levels  <cit> .

we recently developed a collection of expressed sequence tags  specifically for u. americanus, and used the resulting pilot version of microarray with  <dig>  probes to detect gene expression differences in liver and skeletal muscle sampled during hibernation compared to in animals sampled during summer  <cit> . we found a highly significant enrichment during hibernation of the protein biosynthesis category by over-expressed genes in both liver and skeletal muscle. these results demonstrated efficiency of our approach to generating genomic resources and fabricating custom microarrays for non model species. we, therefore, extended gene discovery study and generated additional  <dig>  ests for the black bear  <cit> . in the present study, we used a more representative set of  <dig>  cdna probes to identify more co-regulated functional groups of differentially expressed genes in liver. to obtain the first insight into transcriptional changes in heart of hibernating bears, we used the complete set of  <dig>  probes available for the black bear  <cit> . we focus on pathway analysis identifying functional groups of co-regulated genes rather than on expression of individual genes to assess the biological significance of transcriptional changes associated with hibernation in black bears. liver and heart play an important role in homeostasis and transcriptional changes in these vital organs have been recently reported for small hibernators  <cit> . to investigate any general patterns in transcriptional profiles during mammalian hibernation, we compare functional groups of differentially expressed genes detected in hibernating bears to changes reported for small mammalian hibernators.

RESULTS
body temperature, metabolism and heart rate
as previously reported, hibernating bears had core body temperatures of  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c  and minimum rates of oxygen consumption of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ml g- <dig> h- <dig> , when measured over at least a  <dig>  h interval 2- <dig> hours before euthanasia  <cit> . heart rate  derived by counting beats within a  <dig> s on ecg recording during this period was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  b/min.  and showed pronounced respiratory related sinus arrhythmia. in four hibernating bears for which post-immobilization measurements were made, body temperature decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c to  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c  and hr increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  b/min . sinus arrhythmia was absent in anesthetized bears. bears lost  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  of their body mass per month during the 4- <dig> month hibernation period. metabolic rates measured in two fasted and anesthetized summer active bears were  <dig>  and  <dig>  ml g- <dig> h- <dig> and averaged  <dig>  ml g- <dig> h-1; body temperatures were  <dig>  and  <dig> °c  <cit>  and hr was  <dig>  and  <dig>  b/min and averaged  <dig>  b/min. immediately prior to tissue sampling, metabolic rate of hibernating bears was 36-49%, and body temperature averaged  <dig> °c lower compared to values in summer bears  <cit>  while hr was at about the same level due to the effect of anesthesia.

difference in gene expression
for heart, signals from  <dig>  of  <dig>  probes  on the first bear array showed median intensities that were above the level of two backgrounds, whereas  <dig>  of  <dig>   probes showed significant signals on the second bear array . in order to define genes that were differentially expressed in hibernating compared to summer active bears, we used p <  <dig>  and log2fc >  <dig>  where fc is fold change, the mean expression value in the hibernating bears divided by the mean expression value in the summer active bears, as the cutoff for differentially expressed genes . a total of  <dig> genes,  <dig> % of all unique genes with significant signals , were differentially expressed in heart during hibernation . the maximal change of  <dig>  fold  was detected for rna binding protein motif  <dig> , but most genes  demonstrated moderate changes in expression less than two fold . of the significantly differentially expressed genes, we identified  <dig>  that were over-expressed and  <dig>  genes that were under-expressed in heart during hibernation.

for liver,  <dig>  of  <dig>   probes showed significant signals on the second bear array, and  <dig> genes of these,  <dig> % of all unique genes with significant signal , were differentially expressed in liver during hibernation . there were  <dig>  significantly over-expressed genes and  <dig>  under-expressed genes in liver sampled during hibernation compared to in summer. phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  showed the largest positive expression change of  <dig>  fold , and aldehyde dehydrogenase  was  <dig>  fold down regulated , but most genes  demonstrated modest expression changes that did not exceed two fold .

to validate the microarray results, we conducted quantitative real-time pcr tests for  <dig> randomly selected genes that were identified as differentially expressed by the array hybridizations. expression changes of  <dig>  out of  <dig> genes identified on the array were confirmed by the rt pcr tests  with significant positive correlation  between fold change values of supported genes . high consistency between microarray experiments and rt pcr tests is in agreement with the mean false discovery rate of 12% for the list of differentially expressed genes.

inconsistent significance levels for some genes are in bold.

the expression of  <dig> genes was changed in common in both liver and heart  of which  <dig> genes were elevated in both tissues. rna binding motif protein  <dig>  showed high positive expression change in both liver and heart during hibernation. most genes  up regulated in both tissues are involved in lipid catabolism  and protein biosynthesis . among five genes down regulated in both heart and liver, three genes are involved in amino acid catabolism. five genes demonstrated transcriptional changes in opposite directions in liver and heart.

pathway analysis
the gene ontology analysis revealed a highly significant enrichment of the protein biosynthesis  category in the biological processes and the rna binding in the molecular function by over-expressed genes in both heart and liver during hibernation . four additional categories demonstrated significant enrichment in liver: up regulated genes in the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway and under expressed genes in amino acid catabolism, cholesterol metabolism and cellular respiration categories during hibernation. the molecular function categories with significantly elevated proportion of down regulated genes in liver included catalytic processes: oxidoreductase and transaminase activities .

significant enrichment of the biological processes categories by differentially expressed genes was validated and supported by the results of gene set enrichment analysis . gsea ranks all genes with significant signals on the array therefore its results are not affected by the selection of genes above cutoffs for significance of expression differences and false discovery rate  <cit> .

differential expression of selected genes in liver
some important genes involved in metabolic pathways demonstrated expression differences between hibernating and summer active bears. among  <dig> genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, expression of diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase , 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase , emopamil binding protein , farnesyl diphosphate synthase , propionyl coenzyme a carboxylase  all decreased during winter hibernation. gsea revealed significant enrichment  of the lipid biosynthesis category by genes with lower expression levels in hibernating bears as compared to summer active animals. expression of long-chain fatty acyl elongase  involved in biosynthesis of long chain fatty acids for catabolism through β oxidation increased during winter hibernation. expressions of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  and fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase  <dig> , main control enzymes in the regulation of gluconeogenesis, were elevated during hibernation. in contrast, an important glycolytic gene, pyruvate dehydrogenase beta  and transketolase  involved in the pentose phosphate pathway were down regulated in liver during hibernation.

genes involved in protein catabolism did not show coordinated transcriptional change during hibernation. among  <dig> genes involved in protein catabolism, leucine aminopeptidase  <dig> , calpastatin , proteasome 26s subunit  and proteasome subunit, beta type  were down regulated while yme1l <dig> gene , ubiquitin protein ligase e3a , ubiquitin specific peptidase  <dig>  and f-box and leucine-rich repeat protein  <dig>  were over expressed in liver during hibernation.

differential expression of selected genes in heart
in common with liver , there were three over expressed genes  that are involved in fatty acid beta oxidation in the heart of hibernating bears. among  <dig> genes involved in amino acid catabolism, three genes shared with liver  and glutathione transferase zeta  <dig>  were under expressed in heart during hibernation.

although five out of  <dig> genes involved in protein catabolism were up regulated in heart during hibernation, similar to liver, this category did not demonstrate significant enrichment . over expressed protein catabolism genes included selenoprotein s , ornithine decarboxylase antizyme  <dig> , proteasome  26s subunit , proteasome  subunit alpha type  <dig>  ubiquitin specific peptidase  <dig> .

discussion
hibernating bears were sampled in march after at least  <dig> months of continuous hibernation and while in the absence of food and water. in alaska black bears begin to emerge from hibernation in late april  <cit> , thus, hibernating bears in this study were 3- <dig> weeks from emergence and the beginning of their return to summer levels of metabolism. all bears included as summer active or hibernating animals showed physiology and behavior that was expected for bear during summer and winter seasons, respectively.

anesthesia was necessary for transport of the bears from their den and it was associated with a slight increase in metabolic rate compared to that measured in their dens. however, anesthesia used for immobilization of hibernating bears increased heart rate to the level observed in summer bears.

black bears demonstrate a balanced proportion of up  and down  regulated genes that are differentially expressed in liver during hibernation. this contrasts to hibernating ground squirrels where 90% of differentially expressed genes are down-regulated in liver during hibernation  <cit> . this finding may reflect a greater level of homeostatic activity that is required by livers of hibernating bears compared to ground squirrels, since bears overwinter while maintaining relatively higher body temperatures and rates of metabolism than do small mammal hibernators  <cit> . the proportion of differentially expressed genes up-regulated during hibernation was even higher  in bear heart and this is consistent with increased proportion  of over expressed genes in heart of ground squirrels during torpor  <cit> . increase in the transcription level for a number of genes in heart comparing to liver seems to be the general trend in the transcriptional changes for hibernating mammals.

protein biosynthesis and catabolism of nitrogen compounds
it has been recently shown that the coordinated induction in transcriptional level of protein biosynthesis genes in liver and skeleton muscle is a distinctive feature of the transcriptome in hibernating black bears comparing to small mammalian hibernators  <cit> . this conclusion is supported by the present study that identifies elevated expression of  <dig> protein biosynthesis genes in addition to  <dig> translation genes over expressed in liver during hibernation  <cit> . similar to liver, we found elevated expression of  <dig> protein biosynthesis genes that generate significant enrichment of the translation category in heart during hibernation. molecular function category of rna binding is significantly enriched by over expressed genes in both liver and heart as rna-binding proteins positively regulate the translation of rna. elevated expression of protein biosynthesis genes implies induction of translation in liver and heart during hibernation. a net increase in plasma protein concentration was found in hibernating brown and black bears  <cit> , and this supports elevated protein synthesis in liver during hibernation. bears have a unique ability to preserve muscle mass  <cit>  and retain strength  <cit>  through prolonged periods of inactivity and starvation during hibernation. the induction of protein biosynthesis in liver was suggested as molecular adaptation that contributes to ability to reduce muscle atrophy over prolonged periods of immobility during hibernation  <cit> . decrease in protein synthesis was shown to be the main factor responsible for starvation-induced cardiac atrophy in non-hibernating mammals  <cit> . transitional changes detected in our study imply the induction of protein biosynthesis in the heart of hibernating black bears and suggest an adaptive mechanism that reduces cardiac atrophy during prolonged fasting.

comparing to other genes in the heart of hibernating bears, rna binding motif protein  <dig>  demonstrated the maximum induction in expression. this cold induced rna binding protein is the only gene consistently over expressed across different tissues in hibernating ground squirrels  <cit>  and black bears  <cit> . it was suggested that rna binding protein  <dig> protects mrna transcripts in hibernating ground squirrels  <cit> . taking into account coordinated induction of protein synthesis genes found in our study, over-expression of this protein biosynthesis gene may promote translation in heart of hibernating black bears. there is evidence showing that rbm <dig> facilitates global protein synthesis under mild hypothermia at 32°c by binding to 60s ribosomal subunits and lowering abundance of micrornas that dampen translation in human cell lines  <cit> . over-expression of rbm <dig> was suggested as part of compensatory mechanism to preserve mass of muscle undergoing disuse atrophy  <cit> .

under the condition of prolonged fasting, protein anabolism is directly related to metabolism of amino acids. our results revealed coordinated down regulation of genes involved in amino acid catabolism and transaminase activity during hibernation. this finding implies a reduction in amino acid catabolism in hibernating black bears. reduction in catabolism of amino acids is consistent with coordinated under expression of genes involved in amino group utilization through the urea cycle previously reported in hibernating bears  <cit>  and significant decrease in the urea concentration in blood that was repeatedly observed during hibernation  <cit> . under no dietary intake of amino acids, reduced amino acid catabolism and urea production suggest redirection of amino acids from catabolic pathways to enhanced protein biosynthesis.

fuel shift, cellular respiration and detoxification in liver
we found a coordinated induction of genes involved in fatty acid β oxidation in liver during hibernation. these transcriptional changes are consistent with physiological data showing that hibernating bears primarily use energy stored in fat  <cit> , and this is further supported by respiratory quotient values near  <dig>  that we observed in our hibernating bears  <cit> . in contrast, genes involved in lipid biosynthesis were down regulated in liver, as bears fasted throughout winter. similar to black bears, evidence for induction of lipid catabolism were reported at transcriptional  <cit>  and proteomic levels  <cit>  in hibernating ground squirrels. in relation with lipid metabolism, our study also revealed transcriptional suppression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism in liver during hibernation. the two cytochrome p <dig> genes  catalyzing the first reaction in the cholesterol catabolic pathway in the liver, which converts cholesterol to bile acids, and oxidizing cholesterol intermediates were both down regulated during hibernation. reduction in the cholesterol catabolism is supported by the elevation in cholesterol serum level that has been consistently observed in hibernating black bears  <cit> .

a shift from glucose catabolism to glucose synthesis that provides an energy source for brain and other tissues in fasting conditions was observed at the mrna and protein levels in liver of hibernating ground squirrels  <cit> . similar to small mammalian hibernators, we detected over expression of the two key glucogenic enzymes  as well as down regulation of important glycolytic  and the pentose phosphate shunt  enzymes in liver during hibernation. these results taken together with under expression of glucokinase  catalyzing the irreversible step in glycolysis  <cit>  suggest induction of glucose synthesis and reduction of glucose catabolism in liver of hibernating bears. glycolysis is the first step of cellular respiration. genes involved in cellular respiration demonstrated coordinated under expression in liver during hibernation. apart from glycolytic enzymes, down regulated cellular respiration genes include key enzymes  of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and genes involved in electron transport . molecular function category of electron carrier activity is significantly enriched by under expressed genes in liver as part of cellular respiration and oxidoreductation. coordinated down regulation of cellular respiration genes in the liver, which plays the central role in metabolic homeostasis is consistent with the reduction of metabolic rate  in hibernating bears.

detoxification is an important function of the liver. we detected coordinated repression of genes involved in oxidoreductase activity, acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donors and monooxygenase activity categories of molecular function. in these categories down regulated genes include a number of cytochrome p <dig> genes, flavin containing monooxygenases, aldehyde dehydrogenases that catalyze the oxidation of potentially toxic xenobiotics and metabolites with electron-deficient carbon centers . these transcriptional changes are similar to expression differences detected in small hibernators  <cit> , and they imply that detoxification function of the liver is depressed during hibernation, probably as a result of prolonged food deprivation.

CONCLUSIONS
elevated expression of multiple protein biosynthesis genes is a prominent feature of the transcriptome of hibernating black bears in all organs studied to date in black bears. induction of protein synthesis may be related to adaptive mechanisms reducing cardiac and muscle atrophies over extended periods of low metabolism and immobility during hibernation in bears. transcriptional reduction of genes involved in amino acid catabolism suggests redirection of amino acids from catabolic pathways to elevated protein biosynthesis.

we inferred functional changes by comparing transcripts abundance between hibernating and summer active bears. due to post transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, protein abundance can be different from corresponding gene expression on the mrna level  <cit> . however, functional significance of transcriptional changes detected in our study for the most important groups of co-regulated genes such as protein biosynthesis, catabolism of nitrogenous compounds and lipid metabolism is supported by independent lines of evidence coming from physiology and biochemistry of hibernating bears. another point of support is that mammals generally demonstrate surprisingly high correlation between gene expression at mrna and protein levels. the most comprehensive survey to date in model species revealed significant positive correlation between transcript and corresponding protein quantities for  <dig> % of genes  <cit> . it is also notable that for another mammalian hibernator, significant correlation  was found between expression on the mrna and protein levels when comparing summer active and hibernating arctic ground squirrels  <cit> . ongoing shotgun proteomic analysis will further validate functional significance of transcriptional changes reported here, identify regulatory changes undetectable on transcript level and, thus, provide more understanding of the molecular basis of hibernation in bears.
