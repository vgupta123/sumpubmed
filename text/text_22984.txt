BACKGROUND
lung development is a complex developmental process initiated by budding of the lungs from the gut endodermal tube, multiple rounds of expansion and branching morphogenesis, and final maturation of the epithelial and endothelial components that comprise the airways, pulmonary circulation, and gas exchange surface
 <cit> . it is the final maturation of the lung epithelial cells that is frequently interrupted by premature birth, leading to both acute and chronic lung disease in premature infants
 <cit> . here we demonstrate apparently related roles of the nfib and glucocorticoid receptor  genes in lung maturation.

previous studies showed that loss of nfib resulted in perinatal lethality due to lung immaturity
 <cit> . the lungs of late fetal mice lacking nfib showed reduced expression of type i and type ii epithelial markers along with morphological immaturity exemplified by a failure of the formation of saccules, the precursor to the alveolar air exchange region. in addition, excess proliferation of both mesenchymal and epithelial cells is seen in nfib null lungs. surprisingly, while the phenotype is clearly related to the failure of epithelial cell maturation, loss of nfib only in the mesenchymal cells of the lung yields a very similar phenotype
 <cit> , indicating that mesenchymal cells regulate late epithelial maturation through as yet unknown inductive mechanisms
 <cit> .

prenatal administration of glucocorticoids has been shown to stimulate lung maturation in both mice and premature infants
 <cit> . conversely, deletion of nr3c <dig>  the gene encoding the glucocorticoid receptor, results in a phenotype remarkably similar to that of loss of nfib, including excess cell proliferation, failure of saccularization and reduced expression of markers of epithelial differentiation
 <cit> . as with nfib, loss of nr3c <dig> only in the mesenchyme recapitulates much of this phenotype
 <cit> . the similarity in phenotype seen with the loss of either nfib or nr3c <dig>  together with the shared cell-type expression requirement suggests that these two genes may co-regulate a specific set of genes essential for lung maturation. we therefore examined the lung genes regulated by nfib and nr3c <dig> and the specific binding targets of nfib to determine how these genes may cooperate in the regulation of lung maturation.

RESULTS
chip-seq shows that nfib binds to the known nfi motif in mouse fetal lung
we conducted a chip-seq analysis of nfib in wild type mouse fetal lung at e <dig>  and identified  <dig> peaks from an initial set of  <dig> , <dig> unpaired reads . the distribution of the distances between these peaks and the closest tss shows a strong enrichment within  <dig> kbp both upstream and downstream of the tsss compared to a random control . peaks are particularly enriched at about 100bp upstream of the nearest known tss, showing that nfib frequently binds the proximal promoter. there is also considerable enrichment of peaks downstream of the nearest known tss for several hundred base-pairs. this could represent either binding in the 5’utr of the known gene or binding in the promoter of an unannotated alternative transcript.

we applied the meme algorithm
 <cit>  to repeat-masked
 <cit> , 100bp genomic regions centered on each of the  <dig> nfib chip-seq peaks. the most statistically significant motif found by meme matches the known nfib palindromic consensus sequence tggcnnnnngcca. more importantly, the motif found by meme is extremely similar to the in vitro nfib motif obtained by jolma et al. <cit>  using selex technology . this observation confirms that nfib has similar dna-binding specificity in mouse fetal lung cells as in a cell-free in vitro system. the palindromic binding motif found by meme further strongly suggests that nfib binds mainly as a dimer in these cells. finally, the strong similarity between the in vivo and in vitro motifs for nfib in figure
 <dig> show that the chip-seq experiment and downstream data analysis succeeded.

to further assess the quality of our chip-seq data, we considered the fraction of predicted chip-seq peaks that contain a match to the discovered nfib motif at different motif score thresholds, as computed by the fimo scanning algorithm
 <cit> . at a motif score p-value threshold of 10- <dig>  the nfib motif is present in  <dig> % of the chip-seq peaks but in only  <dig> % of the randomized control sequences . this represents a six-fold enrichment , which exceeds the encode guidelines requiring at least 10% of the peaks to have a four-fold enrichment for the chiped tf’s binding motif
 <cit> .

correlation of nfib binding and expression of nearby genes
we studied the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by nfib in fetal lung cells using our nfib chip-seq data from e <dig>  fetal lung cells and previously published gene expression data from e <dig>  fetal lung cells in wt and nfib-knockout mice
 <cit> .

we first sought for dysregulated genes in the nfib-ko using a 2-fold expression change threshold and a maximal q-value of  <dig>  for selection .

we identified  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> are down-regulated and  <dig> are up-regulated. for convenience, we will refer to the down-regulated genes as “nfib-activated”, and to the up-regulated as “nfib-repressed”. of course, we realize that the observed effect could be due to direct or indirect regulation of the gene in question .

we then counted the numbers of genes with an nfib chip-seq peak within  <dig> kbp,  <dig> kbp or  <dig> kbp . as can be seen in table
 <dig>  only  <dig> % of the nfib-activated genes  have an nfib chip-seq peak within  <dig> kbp of their tss. this is a lower percentage than for all genes , but the difference is not statistically significant .

the table shows the percentage  of nfib-activated, nfib-repressed or all genes that have an nfib peak within the given distance of their tss. percentages are in terms of the total number of genes in the given class. note that we consider only genes for which we have both distance and expression data, so the numbers of activated/repressed genes presented in this table are slightly lower than the total number of nfib-activated genes  and nfib-repressed genes .

if we extend the analysis to binding at up to  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp from the tss, neither the nfib-activated nor nfib-repressed genes have a number of nfib chip-seq peaks that differs significantly from the number expected by chance .

the lack of evidence of a clear relationship between proximal nfib binding and gene expression in table
 <dig> may be due to the fact that the expression data is from a later stage of fetal lung development than the chip-seq data . it is quite possible that the set of genes bound by nfib changes substantially between e <dig>  and e <dig> . another confounding factor is that the gene expression data comes from embryonic lungs where nfib is deleted from e <dig>  but expression is not measured until e <dig> , leaving ample time for compensatory changes in gene expression. in fact among the  <dig> genes identified as activated or repressed at day e <dig>  in the nfib-ko mouse,  <dig> are annotated as having “sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor activity” in the gene ontology  database
 <cit> . the changes in expression of these tfs will affect the expression of many genes, so many of the observed dysregulated genes may be indirect rather than direct targets of nfib. another possibility is that the majority of regulation by nfib is via long-distance chromatin looping
 <cit> , but we consider this unlikely given the clear enrichment of nfib binding events we observe in proximal promoter regions .

promoters of genes activated by nfib are enriched in nfib motifs, but repressed ones are not
in the absence of chip-seq data in e <dig>  mouse fetal lung, we turned to a motif-based analysis of the relationship between nfib binding and gene expression. first, we tested for over-representation of putative nfib binding sites  in the promoters of nfib-activated and nfib-repressed genes . we found a significant enrichment in the nfib-activated genes , but not in the nfib-repressed . this suggest that many genes are activated by nfib through direct interaction, but that repression generally results from indirect regulation.

as a control and to get a broader picture, we then calculated pact and prep and our motif association score  for each of the  <dig> selex-derived motifs reported by jolma et al. <cit> , which cover the dna-binding specificity of most transcription factor families in mammals. we found that the three motifs with the largest mas are the three nfi-family motifs in the jolma et al. <cit>  compendium . these motifs have large positive mas scores, which indicates that their presence in the promoter of a gene is highly correlated with it having reduced expression in the nfib-ko mouse at e <dig> . this suggests that nfib acts as a direct activator of transcription for many genes in our nfib-activated set, in mouse fetal lung at e <dig> . the complete mas results are given in additional file

the table shows the tf motif name , associated gene name , expression fold-change  of the gene, the  motif enrichment p-value in the activated set of genes , the  motif enrichment p-value in the repressed set of genes , and the motif association score . rank is based on the magnitude of the mas, “na” indicates that no expression data is available for the tf gene and “-” in the fc column indicates that expression change is not significant . motif names all in uppercase are derived from human tfs, others are from mouse tfs. *although nfib expression increases in the nfib-ko, no functional protein is produced.

as an additional control, we repeated the complete mas analysis after replacing mouse promoter sequences by their ortholog from rat or human. for both species, nfi motifs were among the most strongly enriched within the set of nfib-activated genes. in human, nfix ranked second , and nfib ranked fourteenth . in rat, nfix ranked third  and nfib ranked tenth . overall, this strongly support the hypothesis that nfib activates its targets during lung maturation through direct interactions near the promoter regions.

the presence of our novel, chip-derived nfib motif in gene promoters shows less significant correlation with gene expression than the selex-based motifs for nfia, nfib and nfix . the new motif  ranks twentieth according to mas, despite being highly similar to the selex-based nfib motif , from which it differs primarily in the preference for an ‘a’ in the right-most position. this may indicate that the new, chip-based motif is slightly less accurate than the selex-based motif, which, if true, could be due to numerous reasons. the accuracy of motifs derived from chip-seq experiments depends strongly on the number of sequences without the motif presented to the motif discovery algorithm. such sequences can be due to imperfect antibody specificity or to indirect dna-binding by the antibody via a protein complex or via chromatin loops bound jointly by the antibody and another dna-binding protein
 <cit> . none of these issues are present in selex experiments, although they suffer from their own limitations. there is no guarantee that the dna-binding specificity of the protein or dna-binding domain assayed by selex is the same under the in vitro selex conditions as it is in in vivo. at any rate, our expression correlation results suggest that the existing selex-based nfi-family motifs are at least as accurate as our chip-derived motif for nfib.

although our new nfib motif ranks twentieth among the  <dig> motifs in the combined motif database, there are effectively only three distinct motifs with higher mas scores . this is because the compendium contains motifs for both mouse and human tfs  and it contains multiple members of transcription factor families. paralogous and orthologous tfs tend to have highly similar dna-binding affinities, as shown by the highly similar motif logos at the leaves of the motif tree in figure
 <dig> 
 <cit> . the tree was drawn using phylodendron
 <cit> .

other tfs may contribute to the nfib-ko phenotype
for each motif in table
 <dig> we have included the expression fold change of the corresponding gene, if significant . the increased expression of nfia in the nfib-ko further suggests that there may be some compensatory mechanism at play between the two paralogs. since the dna-binding motif of nfia is almost identical to that of nfib, it is probable that both transcription factors bind to the same regulatory elements. such an apparently compensatory change in one nfi family member upon loss of another was noted previously in nfib-ko lungs and suggests some type of homeostatic regulation of total nfi levels
 <cit> . however, these data are not sufficient to indicate whether nfia acts as an activator or a repressor, or whether the same genes are regulated by both nfia and nfib.

in addition to the nfi motifs, we note the large positive mas of the meis, snai <dig> and nr2f <dig> motifs, indicating that they are enriched in the nfib-activated gene set . because snai <dig>  meis <dig> and nr2f <dig> are over-expressed in the nfib-ko, it is possible that some genes in our nfib-activated set are repressed by these genes instead of being directly activated by nfib. repressor activity has been documented for each of these three factors
 <cit> . for example snai <dig>  which represses transcription via the recruitment of histone deacetylases to target gene promoters
 <cit> , is known for its antiapoptotic activity and plays a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. while neither epithelial-mesenchymal transition nor altered apoptosis seem implicated in the phenotype of nfib-/- lungs
 <cit> , other epigenetic changes mediated by snai <dig> affecting cell proliferation and cell differentiation are clearly possible and will be investigated. finally, we note the enrichment of the ebf <dig> motif, which regulates cell differentiation
 <cit> . however, according to the microarray data, the ebf <dig> gene is not significantly dysregulated in the nfib-ko.

the apparently paradoxical increased expression of nfib in the nfib-ko lungs  is explained by the fact that only exon  <dig>  is actually knocked out. the microarray is detecting an increase in a transcript that is missing exon  <dig>  and thus cannot lead to a functional nfib protein. one explanation for this increased expression from the nfib promoter in the absence of production of a functional nfib transcript is that nfib normally represses its own production, either directly or indirectly . a second possibility is that the shorter, disrupted transcript is less subject to post-transcriptional degradation that the complete transcript, leading to higher measured expression in the nfib-ko lungs.

for each knockout, the table shows the expression fold change and the associated uncorrected p-value . the expression changes for nfib and nr3c <dig> transcripts in their respective ko  occurs in the context of the transcripts lacking an essential exon and thus no functional protein is expressed.

nfib and nr3c <dig> regulate an overlapping set of genes
nfib-knockout mice show a phenotype very similar to that seen in glucocorticoid receptor  knockout mice. to ask whether this may be due to a common set of dysregulated genes, we compared our nfib-ko microarray data with available microarray data for nr3c1-ko in fetal mice lung at  <dig> 
 <cit> . using the same selection threshold as for the nfib-ko dataset , we identified  <dig> activated genes and  <dig> repressed genes by gr.

the sets of genes activated or repressed by gr overlap significantly with the analogous gene sets for nfib . the sets of activated genes share  <dig> genes in common, which is  <dig>  times higher than what would be expected by chance, while the sets of repressed genes have  <dig> genes in common, a 9-fold enrichment.

the table shows the sizes of the sets of activated and repressed genes for nfib and gr, the size of the overlaps of the gene sets, the expected overlap size, fold enrichment of the overlap and the p-value of the overlap enrichment. note that to compute the enrichment p-value, we must consider only the genes for which we have expression data for both knockouts , so the numbers of activated/repressed genes in this table are different than the numbers reported for the individual knockouts.

as we can see from figure
 <dig>  the direction of the change in expression is the same for all but one of the genes activated/repressed in the two knockout experiments . the one gene whose expression changes in a different direction is aspg  =  <dig>  in nfib-ko; - <dig>  in nr3c1-ko). the pearson correlation coefficient between the log <dig> in the two knockouts of these genes is  <dig> . this strongly suggests that the common phenotype in the two knockouts are due to some or all of the genes in the overlap set. the list of genes activated/repressed in both datasets is available in additional file
 <dig> 

promoters of genes that are activated by both nfib and gr are enriched in nfib and gr motifs
to further test our hypothesis that nfib and nr3c <dig> co-regulate an overlapping set of genes, we looked for motif enrichment in the sets of commonly activated or repressed genes identified above. figure
 <dig> shows the distribution of the mas score for  <dig> motifs in the jolma et al. <cit>  compendium, and the relative position of the gr  and nfib motifs. we note that the mas score of the two motifs are highly significant and among the largest positive ones, ranking at the 8th and 12th positions, respectively . the complete results are available in additional file

the table shows the rank of the mas score , the motif name , the associated gene name , the expression fold-change  of the gene in each ko, the  motif enrichment p-value in the activated set of genes , the  motif enrichment p-value in the repressed set of genes  and the motif association score . “na” indicates that no expression data is available for the tf gene and “-” indicates that expression change is not significant . motif names all in uppercase are for human tfs, others are for mouse tfs. *note that these fc apply to the disrupted transcripts, and that no functional protein is produced for nfib and nr3c <dig> 

among the motifs with a larger  positive mas, we find the androgen receptor , the ebfi motif, motifs for two members of the t-box family of transcription factors and the znf <dig> motif. however, none of the mouse genes corresponding to these motifs shows a significant  expression change in both the nr3c <dig> and nfib knockouts. we also note the large negative mas of foxi <dig> and some estrogen-related receptors . estrogen controls many cellular processes such as growth and differentiation. while esrrb is over-expressed in the nr3c1-ko, we identified no such dysregulation in the nfib-ko. we have no expression data for foxi <dig> in nfib-ko, and this gene is not dysregulated in the nr3c1-ko. however, some other genes of the same fox family are dysregulated in both knockouts, such as foxp <dig>  and foxn <dig> . interestingly, it has been shown that loss of foxp <dig> leads to defective postnatal lung alveolarization in mouse
 <cit> .

similarly to what we did in a previous section, we repeated the mas analysis using human and rat orthologous sequences. for human, nfix ranked third , and nfib ranked nineteenth . for rat, nfix ranked sixth , and nfib ranked eighth . this suggests that nfib activates some nr3c1-activated genes through binding at their promoter sequences. however, nr3c <dig> did not show a significant enrichment for human, and it ranked only  <dig> st in rat . these data suggest that in some instances mechanisms other than direct binding of promoter sequences by nr3c <dig> may mediate co-regulation by nr3c <dig> and nfib. consistent with this finding, previous studies have indicated that some functions of nr3c <dig> are mediated by mechanisms other than direct nr3c <dig> binding to dna. for example, mice defective in dna-binding by nr3c <dig> are viable while those deleted for nr3c <dig> die at birth
 <cit> . thus it will be important to determine the fraction of co-regulated genes whose expression is regulated by direct binding of nr3c <dig> versus other indirect mechanisms of regulation.

regulatory sub-network involving nfib and nr3c1
based on the data presented above, we propose a possible regulatory sub-network involving nfib, nr3c <dig>  nfia and their  <dig> common activated target genes . each of the links represents activation  or repression  of transcription by a transcription factor. each of the links in the figure is numbered, and we describe the experimental support for each link in what follows.

firstly, as shown in table
 <dig> and discussed above, nfib and nfia transcripts are both repressed by nfib, which is indicated by links  <dig> and  <dig> in figure
 <dig>  for simplicity, and because both nfia and nfib are transcription factors and thus can act directly to affect transcription, we depict these as direct interactions, but they may well be indirect. the repression of nfia by nfib is further supported by the observation that nfia is significantly under-expressed  while nfib is significantly over-expressed  in the nr3c1-ko .

secondly, both nr3c <dig> and nfib transcripts are significantly repressed by gr , which we indicate by links  <dig> and  <dig> in figure
 <dig>  we once again depict these as direct interactions for simplicity.

thirdly, we propose that the set of  <dig> genes under-expressed in both knockouts  are activated cooperatively by nfib and nr3c <dig>  while there may be some indirect regulation at play, our motif analysis revealed a significant enrichment for both nfib and gr motifs in this set, which suggests that some of these genes are direct targets of these factors. moreover, the two alternative trivial topologies that could connect nfib and nr3c <dig> to g <dig> are not supported by the data. indeed, the topology 

 nr3c1→nfib→g <dig> 

 is precluded by the data supporting edge  <dig>  and the topology 

 nfib→nr3c1→g <dig> 

would involve under-expression of nr3c <dig> in the nfib-ko, which is not observed. we indicate the direct cooperation hypothesis by link  <dig> in figure
 <dig> 

finally, since the dna binding affinities of nfia and nfib are highly similar , we infer that nfia may bind many of the same regulatory elements as nfib. we therefore hypothesize that nfia may regulate the genes in g <dig>  which we indicate by link  <dig> figure
 <dig>  however, it is not clear from the available data whether nfia acts as a repressor or an activator of these genes.

go analysis of putative common targets of nfib and nr3c1
to identify which biological processes could be activated by nfib and nr3c <dig>  we tested for gene-annotation enrichment using gorilla
 <cit>  and a ranked list approach . we found significant enrichment for several general terms including “cell adhesion” , “transport”  and “immune system process” , but this required the inclusion of genes that are not in the set of  <dig> putative common targets . this suggests that both nfib and nr3c <dig> may regulate these processes in some manner during lung development. on the other hand, we found significant enrichment for three specific terms where nfib and nr3c <dig> are more likely to play a direct role since the associated genes are among the  <dig> common targets we have identified: first, “cellular defense response” , with the tnfrsf <dig>  and ncf <dig>  genes; second, “regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway” , with the myoc1c  and xdh  genes; third, “regulation of fibroblast proliferation” , with sphk <dig> , aqp <dig>  and cdkn1a  genes. we are currently examining these genes in more detail to assess nfib and gr binding to putative regulatory regions.

discussion
lung maturation is a complex process dependent on cooperation between the mesenchyme, epithelium and endothelial cells to promote vascularization, epithelial differentiation, mesenchyme thinning and lung morphogenesis
 <cit> . previous studies using transcriptional profiling have identified large numbers of genes whose expression levels change substantially during each of the characteristic stages of mouse lung development: 1) embryonic, 2) pseudoglandular, 3) canalicular, 4) saccular and 5) alveolar
 <cit> . for example mariani et al. demonstrated groups of extracellular matrix genes that exhibit stage-specific expression patterns in mouse lung
 <cit> . however the vast majority of these changes in gene expression represent stage-specific differentiation markers of epithelial or mesenchymal cells which define the cellular phenotype at each stage, but give little information on the regulatory mechanisms that control the differentiation process. conversely, genetic studies have been instrumental in the discovery of gene regulatory pathways essential for early, and to a lesser extent, later stages of lung development. for example, reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal inductions have been shown to be essential for both early and late stages of lung development
 <cit> . in addition, while a number of signaling pathways including the fgf
 <cit> , shh
 <cit> , bmp
 <cit> , wnt
 <cit>  and tgf
 <cit>  pathways are known to signal within and between the epithelium and mesenchyme, the transcriptional networks that respond to and/or generate these pathways and mediate the maturation program remain largely unknown
 <cit> .

both the nfib and gr transcription factors have been shown previously to regulate the transition from the canalicular to the saccular stage in mouse lung
 <cit> . indeed mutations in either gene result in a very similar phenotype characterized by an excess of mesenchymal and epithelial cells at e <dig>  severe reduction or failure of saccule formation, severe delay in type i and type ii cell differentiation and resultant perinatal lethality with largely non-inflated lungs. more recently it was determined using conditional ko alleles that nfib and nr3c <dig> expression in the lung mesenchyme, not lung epithelium, is essential for normal lung maturation
 <cit> . the similarity in phenotype seen with loss of either nfib or nr3c <dig> initially suggested that these two transcription factors might be cooperating in a conserved pathway of lung maturation. our determination of a significant overlap between the genes whose expression changes with the loss of either nfib or nr3c <dig>  in lung mesenchyme is consistent with this hypothesis. in addition, the motif analysis showed significant enrichment of nfi and gr binding motifs in genes whose expression decreased in both nfib-ko and nr3c1-ko lungs  suggesting cooperative activation of these genes by these factors.

CONCLUSIONS
our computational analysis combining expression, binding and motif data provide the first evidence for nfib and nr3c <dig> co-regulating genes related to lung maturation. although these data are consistent with the model of nfib and nr3c <dig> function shown in figure
 <dig>  other models are possible. for example, it may be that the overlap in differentially expressed genes in the two mutants  is a reflection of the overall phenotype  rather than being causally dependent on direct co-regulation by nfib and nr3c <dig>  to distinguish between such alternate hypotheses it will be necessary to simultaneous assess gr and nfib binding to mouse lung target genes and assess the frequency of co-occupancy at potential target genes. while gr chip-seq data is available for human lung cancer cells
 <cit> , rat pheochromocytoma cells
 <cit>  and mouse adipocytes
 <cit> , because gr binding to dna is highly dependent on chromatin context and thus shows high cell-type specificity
 <cit>  these data sets are of marginal use at best for determining gr targets in normal lung mesenchyme. in addition, while the chip-seq data set used here for nfib was determined at e <dig> , it will be necessary to assess both nfib and gr binding at multiple stages of lung development to determine the temporal sequence during which nfib and gr bind to target sites to regulate gene expression. however, even in the absence of such data our determination that both nfib and gr binding motifs are among those most highly associated with genes whose expression is decreased by loss of either nfib and nr3c <dig>  provides a useful framework for future studies.
