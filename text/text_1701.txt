BACKGROUND
tilapia is a common name for a large number of species belonging to the order perciformes which accounts for one fourth of all vertebrate species. they are members of the family cichlidae which consists of more than  <dig> species distributed across tropical and subtropical regions. tilapia are currently the second most farmed fish in the world with an annual production exceeding  <dig>  million tons in  <dig>  <cit> . tilapia are a valuable source of protein for developing and emerging countries, but it is now also a prime fish commodity in developed countries. apart from their domestic importance, there is a wealth of studies on different aspects of tilapia biology, e.g. on their physiology, endocrinology, immunology, toxicology and genetics. tilapia have a short generation time, are sufficiently large in size for physiological studies and can be easily reared making them a perfect model system. they exhibit a versatile adaptability to different environmental conditions to match the vast array of their ecological habitats. they can tolerate incredible variations in temperature , ph , salinity , and oxygen levels . therefore, they constitute exquisite models for environmental genomics, to analyse the interactions between the genome and the environment, and the adaptive responses to environmental stresses  <cit> . because tilapia are closely related to the cichlid fishes in the great lakes of east africa, which have undergone a spectacular radiation, they will contribute to our understanding of evolutionary mechanisms. the  <dig> cichlid species in these lakes represent a collection of natural mutants that may provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of speciation and adaptation  <cit> . these unique biological features have motivated the development of a range of genomic tools for the nile tilapia, oreochromis niloticus, one of the most farmed tilapia species. an extensive collection of ests was recently constructed to aid the annotation of the forthcoming nile tilapia genome and for gene expression studies  <cit> . likewise the analysis of  <dig>  bac end sequences and their alignment on the genome sequence of four model fish species  provides a valuable intermediate resource for the mapping of genes in cichlids  <cit> . the culmination of these efforts is the whole genome sequence currently being assembled by the broad institute .

there are several economic traits in tilapia such as growth  <cit>  and sex-ratio  <cit>  that need improvement and require genetic markers for their selection. likewise, identification of qtls  for other economic traits are being performed in tilapia  <cit>  as well as for immune responses  <cit> . two nile tilapia genetic maps were constructed, for qtl mapping and for selection purposes, of which the latest contains  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> gene markers  <cit> . these genetic maps established  <dig> linkage groups although the tilapia karyotype is composed of just  <dig> chromosome pairs  <cit> . these genetic maps provided a first characterization of the tilapia genomes. because only a few gene-based markers were mapped, synteny relationships with model fish species were only possible at low resolution. the map has been updated with a few more gene-based markers but the number of comparative markers remains limited  <cit> .

radiation hybrid  mapping is suited to mapping all types of markers including gene-based markers, and can order them at high resolution. rh maps can integrate genetic maps through the mapping of polymorphic markers, as well as construct comparative maps through the mapping of non polymorphic markers . in zebrafish the rh map allowed much higher gene-marker coverage of the genome and permitted comparisons with other vertebrates  <cit> . these advantages are particularly evident for fish species lacking genome tools, such as sea bass, where a gene-based rh map enabled comparisons with the genomes of stickleback, pufferfish, medaka and zebrafish  <cit> . likewise, the two rh maps constructed for the seabream allowed comparisons with the pufferfish genome sequence  <cit> . global synteny relationships were also established between three farmed perciformes  and with the model species   <cit> .

high-resolution rh maps are also of great help in scaffolding genome sequences developed in shotgun projects  <cit> . in many cases draft and even “finished” genome sequences from shotgun projects contain large sequence gaps that imply inconsistencies in the placement of scaffolds. in addition, low in-depth sequences lack long-range continuity and provide only a fragmented view of a genome. this was precisely the case for the fugu genome sequence, which consists of  <dig> unconnected scaffolds without any chromosome assignment  <cit> . the construction of rh panels for fish species has not been an easy task. to date, only four fish rh panels have been reported. two zebrafish rh panels were derived from permanent cell lines  <cit> . more recently, a seabream rh panel was constructed from primary fibroblasts  <cit>  and the european seabass rh panel was derived from splenocytes  <cit> , thus avoiding the problems of genome rearrangements that arise in cell lines.

here we describe the construction of a nile tilapia rh panel derived from fresh splenocytes and a gene-rich rh map of  <dig> markers. the rh map was integrated with the nile tilapia karyotype by fish analysis. this allowed us to assign the rh groups to the  <dig> chromosomes as well as to identify their orientation with respect to the centromere. the mapping of  <dig> microsatellites permitted the anchoring of the genetic map to the rh map. amongst the different markers selected for the nile tilapia rh map there was a large proportion related to growth and reproduction. in addition, a large number of snps identified in individuals from the 10th generation of the widely cultured gift  strain were included in the rh map .

RESULTS
rh panel
we fused hprt— derivative cho host cells with nile tilapia splenocytes γ-irradiated at 3500 rad. hybrid cells maintaining nile tilapia chromosome fragments were selected based on their growth in hat medium. a total of  <dig> hybrid cell lines were obtained through  <dig> fusion experiments. the retention frequency  was determined for every clone by typing a set of  <dig> microsatellites selected from the genetic map  <cit> . we selected  <dig> hybrid cell lines on the basis of their retention frequency and their genome representation . further typing of  <dig> additional markers on this  <dig> cell line panel led to a cumulative retention frequency of  <dig>  %. this rather low retention value is compensated by the unusually high number of hybrid cell lines, which allowed us to substantially increase the number of genotyping data. the nile tilapia rh panel was therefore constructed from fresh live cells that required no primary culture, an important condition to avoid genome rearrangements typical of permanent cell lines. splenocytes are convenient to use, as they are abundant, their dissociation is easy and can be performed in a relatively short time preceding the irradiation step.

marker selection
a total of  <dig>  nile tilapia expressed sequence tags  were collected, consisting of  <dig> sequences from the cirad,  <dig> sequences from the ncbi nucleotide database and  <dig> sequences from the rbest database . a proportion of  <dig>  % of these sequences were identified as simple repeats and masked by the repeatmasker program. sequence alignment with the cap <dig> software resulted in  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets i.e.  <dig> unique sequences putatively corresponding to as many genes . these  <dig> sequences were aligned onto the stickleback, pufferfish, medaka and zebrafish genome sequences using the exonerate software. a minimum score of  <dig>  corresponding to a minimal alignment length of 50 bp, was applied following the usual recommendations to map orthologous ests  <cit> . a maximal alignment size of 300 bp was imposed to avoid hits that may in fact correspond to retrogenes rather than orthologs . according to these criteria,  <dig> of the unique sequences had a hit with at least one of the model genomes:  <dig>  had a hit with stickleback,  <dig>  with medaka,  <dig>  with pufferfish and  <dig>  with zebrafish . a total of  <dig> nile tilapia sequences were conserved across all four model species, while  <dig> nile tilapia sequences were conserved exclusively with stickleback,  <dig> with medaka,  <dig> with pufferfish and  <dig> with zebrafish.

we preferentially designed gene markers from nile tilapia ests having the highest conservation with the stickleback. although nile tilapia is phylogenetically closer to medaka  <cit> , the stickleback genome appears to be the best reference sequence because it is assembled with highest confidence  <cit> . each marker was designed from the aligned region having the best homology  with the reference genome. this strategy minimized the possibility of an intron lying between the oligonucleotides. the nile tilapia illumina beadarray contained  <dig> markers consisting of  <dig> genes,  <dig> bacs and  <dig> microsatellites. sequence analysis of a nile tilapia reduced representation library  resulted in the detection of  <dig> snps. of these, a subset of  <dig> snps was genotyped on the rh panel.

genotyping
out of the initial  <dig> selected markers and the subsequent  <dig> snp markers genotyped on the rh panel,  <dig> and  <dig> markers respectively showed an exploitable profile and were selected to construct the rh map. roughly one third of the markers had to be removed from the initial set, as their calls could not be separated in two distinct clusters of presence and absence on the graphic representation. this ratio of failure is high, but is in the range of what was observed for our previous rh map constructions using pcr genotyping . with this strategy a similar proportion of designed pairs of oligonucleotides either do not properly amplify the test dna or amplify both the test dna and the carrier hamster cell dna and thus are not useful for rh map construction. the current nile tilapia map was constructed with a final set of  <dig> markers consisting of  <dig> genes,  <dig> microsatellites,  <dig> bacs and  <dig> snp, including  <dig> markers genotyped by pcr .

rh group characteristics
the two-point analysis of the  <dig> markers using the multimap software started at a lod score of  <dig> , which was then increased in a step-wise fashion up to a threshold of lod  <dig> . the final map consists of  <dig> rh groups containing between  <dig> to  <dig> markers each for a total of  <dig> markers. sixty-two markers remained unlinked. the  <dig> markers are spread in  <dig> positions of which  <dig> positions consist of a single marker,  <dig> positions contain two co-localized markers and three positions contain  <dig> to  <dig> co-localized markers. multipoint analysis was carried out with carthagène software that ordered markers within each rh group and determined their distances expressed in centirays . rh groups ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> cr <dig>  inter-marker distances vary between  <dig> and  <dig> cr <dig> with an average of  <dig> cr <dig>  characteristics of the rh groups in terms of size and marker content are presented in additional file 3: s <dig>  assuming a nile tilapia genome size of 1060 mb  <cit>  the mapping of  <dig> markers corresponds to a density of  <dig>  marker per megabase or one marker per 780 kb, when considering an even distribution of the markers.

the relationship between cr <dig> and kilobase  can be estimated from the ratio of rh to genetic distances  knowing the ratio between cm and kb. to this end, we identified  <dig> pairs of microsatellites separated by a known distance measured in genetic and rh units. the cumulated distance of these  <dig> couples is  <dig>  cr <dig> on the rh map and 604 cm on the genetic map i.e. a ratio of  <dig>  cr3500/cm. the size of the nile genome being 1060 mb  <cit>  and the size of the genetic map being 1311 cm the ratio was estimated to 840 kb/cm  <cit> . therefore, the relation of physical unit to rh unit is estimated to be  <dig>  kb/cr <dig>  the calculated size in kb of the rh map is  <dig>  kb  and thus corresponds to a coverage of 88% of the entire genome size. considering that ~96% of the markers  were mapped in the  <dig> rh groups, one can estimate the probability of mapping a novel marker of interest in one of the existing rh group to be 96 %. this figure can most likely be considered as a better estimate of the coverage of the nile rh map.

because most of the markers designed for the nile tilapia rh map were from ests, the genome regions that remain uncovered may correspond to gene-poor regions such as heterochromatin or regions containing genes that are poorly expressed.

integration of rh map and fish data
the fish mapping of bac clones analyzed two by two allowed us  to assign rh groups to specific chromosomes with higher confidence,  to orient them relative to each other and  to localize centromeric and telomeric ends on the chromosome maps. they also served as a validation of linkage group assignment. in addition to ordering based on fish mapping, the rh groups were tentatively ordered and orientated on the basis of the two-point analyses between markers close to rh group extremities and on the basis of the genetic map. the chromosome map of lg <dig> featuring rh and fish maps along with the genetic map is presented in figure  <dig>  all chromosome maps are available in additional file 4: data s <dig> and online . table  <dig> presents chromosome characteristics in terms of number of markers and rh groups. we first selected  <dig> bac clones that contained markers assigned to  <dig> rh. a second set of  <dig> bac clones was selected from regions of interest based on synteny with reference species, obtained from the bouillabase server.

of the  <dig> initially selected bac clones, fish data from  <dig> bacs were not taken into account. they correspond to bacs producing many signals on different chromosome pairs , and/or to the observation of strong background signals in spite of the use of competitor and carrier dna. they were deleted from the analysis and in many circumstances replaced by other bacs from the same linkage group. successful hybridization results were those in which the two probes for the same lg group gave a clear signal and could be repeatedly observed in at least  <dig> metaphase spreads. thus a total of  <dig> bac markers  were successfully hybridized and mapped in  <dig> rh groups. this allowed all of the main rh groups  to have at least one bac mapped by rh and fish. for  <dig> chromosomes, two to four bacs were used to assemble several rh groups onto a single chromosome . this was the case for instance, of lg <dig>  constituted by three rh groups . each of the  <dig> chromosomes can now be identified with the help of one to four fluorescent probes. this is a particularly important result because, with the exception of the largest chromosome pair , which is three times larger than any other nile tilapia chromosomes and of the second chromosome pair , none of the other chromosomes can be easily distinguished using classical cytogenetic techniques, due to similarity in size and fluctuations in the chromatin condensation  <cit> . these bac chromosome markers can also be used to identify orthologous chromosomal regions among closely related species within the tilapia group . they can also be used to provide insights on the evolution of chromosome regions that have taken place since the divergence of tilapia and other cichlids from their ancestors. the list of clones, their reference and chromosome assignation is presented in table  <dig> 

all the bac probes hybridized to the long arm of the chromosomes  with the exception of lg <dig>  this lg is composed of two rh groups and the bac probes taken from each rh group both hybridized to the short arm of the chromosome. chromosome lg <dig> is a small submetacentric chromosome in which the small arm is often clearly visible. it very probably corresponds to the chromosome  <dig> as defined by ferreira et al.  <cit> .

integration of rh and genetic maps
the published genetic map of nile tilapia was constructed with  <dig> microsatellite markers and  <dig> gene markers present on  <dig> linkage groups   <cit> . the integration of the rh map onto this genetic map was established using the  <dig> microsatellites present in both maps. hence, fifty of the  <dig> rh groups were connected to the  <dig> genetic linkage groups, placing them onto  <dig> chromosome maps which contained on average  <dig>  rh groups per chromosome. these  <dig> rh groups totalize  <dig> map positions containing  <dig> markers, which represent  <dig> % of the markers located on the map. the remaining  <dig> small rh groups containing two to nine markers totalize  <dig> markers, which correspond to  <dig> % of the markers on the map. they cannot be assigned to any chromosomes presently. these groups ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> cr <dig> 

in the rh map we were able to associate two small lgs, lg <dig> and lg <dig> into a single chromosome by rh mapping of four microsatellite markers . we also merged and confirmed by fish analysis the previously grouped lg <dig> and lg <dig> into a unique chromosome  <cit> . lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> correspond each to a single rh group whereas  <dig> lgs are made of two to five rh groups . consequently we have been able to locate the  <dig> linkage groups and placed them onto  <dig> chromosome pairs. for simplicity, we named the chromosomes maps after the genetic linkage groups  of the nile tilapia genome  <cit> .

overall the microsatellites in lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> or lg <dig> are in the same order in the rh and genetic maps except for small local inversions that may be due to vector quality  in one of the mapping methodologies. however, a larger discrepancy was observed in the lower part of lg <dig>  this rh group was tentatively broken at higher lod scores  but no reordering of the resulting groups was consistent with the genetic map. given the high lod score to which this group stayed unbroken we believe that the correct order is that of the rh map.

comparative genomics
synteny relationships were established from the markers of the assigned rh groups having localized orthologous genes in the sequences of model species. orthologs localized in the “chromosome unknown” of model species were not taken into account. of the  <dig> mapped positions in the assigned rh groups,  <dig> markers allowed anchorage of the nile tilapia genome with all four model fish species,  <dig> with three species,  <dig> with two species and  <dig> with one species representing a total of  <dig> orthologous markers providing  <dig> anchors. synteny relationships identified by two or more consecutive conserved markers defined a conserved segment  while a single marker identified a singleton  <cit>  <cit> .

the oxford grid shown in figure 4a recapitulates the cs found between nile tilapia and stickleback. the nile tilapia rh map and the stickleback genome sequence were connected by  <dig> anchors defining  <dig> cs. seventeen cs correspond to entire chromosomes in which synteny is perfectly conserved between the two species. the nile tilapia chromosome lg <dig> is made of two cs corresponding to stickleback chromosomes gac <dig> and gac <dig>  conversely, nile tilapia chromosomes lg <dig> and lg <dig> consist of one cs each that are fused in stickleback to form chromosome gac <dig>  furthermore, nile tilapia chromosomes lg <dig> and lg <dig> both correspond to stickleback chromosome gac <dig>  this pattern of synteny would imply at least three inter-chromosomal rearrangements between the two lineages. the presence of two interstitial telomeric signals in nile tilapia lg <dig>  <cit>  suggests that this chromosome arose by two fusions. it has been suggested that these occurred within the cichlid lineage  <cit>  but the stickleback-tilapia synteny  may suggest that these are older.

a total of  <dig> anchors identified  <dig> cs connecting the nile tilapia rh map and the medaka genome sequence . synteny is entirely conserved between  <dig> chromosomes of the two species. as with stickleback, the nile tilapia chromosome lg <dig> is made of two cs corresponding to medaka chromosomes ola <dig> and ola <dig>  the nile tilapia chromosome lg <dig> is also made of two cs, a large one corresponding to medaka chromosome ola <dig> and a small one corresponding to medaka chromosome ola <dig>  this pattern implies two inter-chromosomal rearrangements that would have occurred in one or the other lineage. medaka chromosome ola <dig> is the only chromosome with no nile tilapia chromosome counterpart in the oxford grid . however three arguments suggest that lg <dig> is the missing counterpart of medaka chromosome ola <dig> in the oxford grid:  a two-point analysis between end-markers links orphan group rh <dig> to lg <dig>   rh <dig> and medaka chromosome ola <dig> share five ortholog sequences  and  tilapia marker af <dig> located on lg <dig> has an ortholog sequence on medaka chromosome ola <dig>  the grouping of rh <dig> and lg <dig> creates an additional synteny breakpoint with medaka as well as with stickleback and pufferfish.

we identified  <dig> anchors connecting the nile tilapia rh map and the pufferfish genome  defining  <dig> cs between these two species. synteny appeared totally conserved between  <dig> chromosomes of the two species. chromosome lg <dig> corresponds to two cs, a large one that corresponds to chromosome tni <dig> and a small cs made of two markers, which corresponds to chromosome tni <dig>  the chromosome lg <dig> consists of two cs, one with chromosome tni <dig> and one with chromosome tni <dig>  pufferfish chromosome tni <dig> is made of two cs corresponding to lg <dig> and lg <dig> respectively. chromosome tni <dig> is also made of two cs with nile tilapia chromosomes lg8- <dig> and lg16- <dig>  a small additional segment of chromosome tni <dig> is conserved with nile tilapia chromosome lg8- <dig>  this pattern of conservation implies four inter-chromosomal events. assignation of the orphan group rh <dig> to lg <dig> as discussed above would create an additional cs and would imply another inter-chromosomal event. additional cs exist but have not been identified yet such as in chromosome lg <dig> for which most of the pufferfish orthologs are located in the “chromosome unknown” file of the pufferfish assembly.

ten chromosomes show no synteny breakage across the four species . twenty five singletons were identified between nile tilapia and stickleback,  <dig> between nile tilapia and medaka and  <dig> between nile tilapia and pufferfish. these singletons suggest putative new cs but they also may be artefacts. indeed the orthologous location of a given gene in a model species was defined as the best hit on the genome sequence of that species. however the best hit may in some instances have corresponded to a paralog especially when the true ortholog has been lost as hypothesized by soler et al.  <cit>  to explain a possibly overestimated number of breakpoints. consequently each singleton will have to be established as a new cs by the mapping of additional and informative markers.

the number of cs appeared similar between nile tilapia and each of the three reference models investigated in this work. this is in concordance with what was previously observed in the comparative map of the sea bass genome and the same fish models  <cit> . finally, nile tilapia and zebrafish were considered too distant phylogenetically to establish a pattern of chromosomal conservation despite the fact that  <dig> anchors were identified between the two species.

on an intra-chromosomal scale, conserved segments ordered  are regions in which the order of orthologous genes is perfectly conserved  <cit> . the simultaneous comparison of several species allowed us to ascertain the extent and boundaries of shared cso while also revealing the breakpoints that arose in some lineages. the nile tilapia rh map aimed at identifying these cso with stickleback, medaka and pufferfish in order to benefit from the comprehensive sequencing of these model genomes. thus the location on the nile tilapia genome of unmapped genes having a clear orthologous relationship with genes of the model species could be hypothesized with high confidence. cso between stickleback, medaka, pufferfish and nile tilapia were identified using the autograph web server and are presented in table  <dig>  detailed cso of lg <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  comparative maps of each of the  <dig> chromosomes are presented in additional file 5: data s <dig> 

cs: conserved segments.

cso: conserved segment ordered.

we identified  <dig> cso between nile tilapia and stickleback. chromosomes lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> underwent few rearrangements with one to two cso only  while for lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig>  seven, six and seven cso respectively were identified, showing evidence of considerable rearrangement. a total of  <dig> cso were identified between nile tilapia and medaka. one cso was detected in chromosomes lg <dig> and lg <dig> while lg <dig> and lg <dig> were the most rearranged. only  <dig> cso were detected between nile tilapia and pufferfish .

a higher number of cso was identified with stickleback than with medaka and pufferfish. considering that the phylogenetic position based on various parameters between nile tilapia and the other model species indicates a closer relationship between nile tilapia and medaka one would rather have expected the contrary  <cit> . however, in terms of sequence similarity nile tilapia is actually closer to stickleback than to medaka and pufferfish. this apparent discrepancy, if confirmed, would indicate that forces shaping the overall genome structure are different from those affecting gene function and evolution. finally, from a technical standpoint, it is important to recall that the number of observed cso shared by two species depends in part on the number of anchors used to establish the respective comparative maps. indeed the higher the number of orthologous genes is, the more resolution the comparative map will have. ideally in this study, the comparative maps should be based solely on 1:1:1: <dig> orthologs between nile tilapia, stickleback, medaka and pufferfish. however only half of the markers satisfy this condition. comparative maps based on this smaller number of markers have too little resolution to reach any conclusions.

the sequence assembly status in some genomic regions of model species also prevents the identification of cso with nile tilapia. for example, assemblies of stickleback gac <dig> , medaka ola <dig> , pufferfish tni <dig>  or tni <dig>  are incomplete and lead to an underestimation of the number of cso. assuming a conserved gene order with the nile tilapia the rh map would provide an opportunity to locate the unassigned contigs of model species. in this way the nile tilapia rh map can be seen as a tool for improving the sequence assemblies of other fish species.

chromosomes lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> appear to be the least rearranged between nile tilapia and the three model genomes. conversely lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> were the most rearranged. this observation suggests that the genome plasticity and the underlying evolutionary constraints are not evenly distributed across the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
through a spectacular decrease in cost and with the capability to generate more than hundred gigabases per week, the new sequencing technologies  have revolutionized the field of genomics over the last few years. it is now possible to obtain deep knowledge of the genomes of many more species than we could have dreamed of even ten years ago. however the main drawback of ngs is the short length of their reads. although steadily increasing, sequence reads are still very short . this is not a problem when the goal is to re-sequence individuals and align the reads to a reference sequence. however this short size, even with a pair ends sequencing approach, renders the problem of de novo sequencing of large genomes difficult. many of the novel assemblies produced with this approach are composed of a very large number of scaffolds  <cit> . this discontinuity does not affect gene discovery, polymorphism analysis and sequence comparison between closely related species but it greatly limits the study of the genome structure and evolution. rh mapping and fish mapping of markers present in different contigs and scaffolds allow to link them and deduce larger super scaffolds.

here we report the construction of a high-resolution rh map of nile tilapia containing ests, genes, microsatellites and snps. the rh map has an estimated density of one marker every 780 kb. fifty rh groups, which contained the vast majority of the markers , were assigned to the  <dig> previously known lgs, which in turn were located and oriented on the  <dig> nile tilapia chromosomes through bac multicolor fish mapping on metaphase chromosomes. already this rh map allows us to locate a large number of physiologically important genes. for example, group rh <dig> located on chromosome lg <dig> contains the estrogen receptor gene together with gata <dig> and the follicle-stimulating hormone gene . this last gene has been shown to regulate the activity of gata <dig>  a transcription factor involved in ovarian function, by regulating the aromatase cyp <dig> gene  <cit> . likewise, the growth hormone receptor gene ghr <dig>  was mapped in the group rh <dig> assigned to chromosome lg <dig> and the growth hormone receptor gene ghr <dig>  was mapped in the group rh <dig> assigned to chromosome lg <dig> 

the rh map associated to the fish data also offers a detailed synteny analysis with three of the four model species . due to the great evolutionary distance separating nile tilapia from zebrafish , it was not possible to reach definitive conclusions about synteny between these species. furthermore, it provides a foundation for studying karyotypic evolution in the flocks of haplochromine cichlids in east africa, including the evolution of sex chromosomes  <cit>  and the origins of b chromosomes  <cit> . by contributing to the construction of a golden path for the nile tilapia genome assembly, these maps will enable qtl and association mapping of adaptive traits in each of the haplochromine species flocks.

the mapping of a number of snps derived from  <dig> individuals of the 10th generation of the widely cultured gift strain are included. to the best of our knowledge these snps are the first set of genome wide snps publicly available for nile tilapia. snps are gaining popularity for use in e.g. parental assignment  <cit>  and for the estimation of genetic parameters in tilapia breeding. the  <dig> snp markers were shown to allow the discrimination between different strains and species of tilapia , and will be used in the near future to assess the genetic diversity of natural populations of nile tilapia . the physical mapping position of these snps determined in this study allows the selection of unlinked snps for these future applications. finally the map will help to place and orientate on the nile tilapia karyotype many of the scaffolds identified in the forthcoming tilapia genome sequence determined with the illumina technology and assembled by the broad institute.
