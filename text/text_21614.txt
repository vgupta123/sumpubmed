BACKGROUND
the insertion sequence   <dig> is specific for the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex   <cit> . m. tuberculosis strains typically contain multiple copies of is <dig>   <cit> , although strains with only a single copy or no copies have also been identified  <cit> . in contrast, m. bovis strains are characterized by having a low copy number, with m. bovis bcg substrains having either one or two copies  <cit> . the high variability in copy number and location of is <dig>  as well as its stability over time, renders is <dig> a useful diagnostic and epidemiological tool. moreover, in some cases, the location of a copy that is specific for a strain can be used for the rapid identification and differentiation of that particular strain from other isolates  <cit> .

without a known insertion target, is <dig> has been found within orfs and intergenic regions  <cit> . the is <dig> locations along the genome are not equally distributed, being found more often in some regions, while completely absent in others  <cit> . in single-copy strains of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis, is <dig> is always present in the conserved 36-bp array, designated the direct repeat region   <cit>  and, with minor exceptions, all members of the mtbc carry a copy integrated in this locus. general hot-spots of is <dig> include is <dig> in ipla-iplb region  <cit> , the phospholipase c region   <cit> , members of the ppe gene family  <cit>  and the origin of replication   <cit> .

one of the most relevant and better studied mechanisms of genome change is is-mediated. it is considered that about 5% to 15% of the spontaneous mutations in the bacterial genome are due to changes in is locations  <cit> . transposition is one of the more common mechanisms used by is to move along genome, whereas recombination between two is copies can lead to genome deletions  <cit> . hence, an is could either play a role as a potential enemy or a helpful ally affecting the fitness of the bacterium. is <dig> insertions, genetic reorganizations and deletions are some of the mechanisms proposed to be responsible for differences in the virulence phenotypes among m. tuberculosis strains. is <dig> has been associated with participation in adaptation to a particular host  <cit> , activation of genes during infection  <cit> , evolution  <cit>  and in activation of downstream genes with an orientation-dependent activity promoter  <cit> .

the beijing strains are considered one of the most successful families in tuberculosis transmission. three features that characterize the beijing family are related to the is <dig> insertion sequence. these include: i) the presence of a copy in the oric known as insertion a <dig>  ii) the deletion of the region of difference   <dig>  and iii) a similar is6110-rflp multiband pattern profile  <cit> . members of this genotype are characterized by a high-copy number of is <dig> <cit> , suggesting the potential implication of this element in the special characteristics of this family related to virulence and capacity for rapid dissemination.

in the present work, we conducted an in-depth study of the points of insertion of is <dig> in selected beijing clinical isolates and in the beijing strains available in the literature and in the dna sequence databases. with the obtained locations, we generated a representative primer collection of beijing-is <dig> points of insertion, which was used to analyse  <dig> high-copy clinical isolates. we established the specific and shared copy locations in the studied strains and constructed a dendrogram allowing the accurate classification of beijing genotype strains.

RESULTS
generation of a primer collection of is <dig> insertion points
firstly, we studied the points of insertion of is <dig> in eight representative beijing strains  by lmpcr. twenty-two new genomic insertion points were obtained by this technique. primers for the identified new is <dig> locations were designed and added to primers used in a previous work for localization of is <dig> copies in the beijing strain gc <dig>  <cit> . through lmpcr and pcr, a total of  <dig>  is <dig> insertion points were obtained and plotted on the h37rv genome map. the shared insertion points by these eight strains and the three reference beijing strains  were obtained .

in addition, we analysed the is <dig> insertion points in  <dig> reference sequenced strains in the genebank comparing their sequenced fragments with h37rv genome. we obtained a total of  <dig> points of insertion , which were plotted on the h37rv genome map and were grouped in two concentric circles: one corresponding to non-beijing strains  and another to beijing strains  .

in addition to the genebank analysis, we reviewed the available literature  <cit>  for new locations of is <dig> in beijing strains, for which new pairs of primers were designed. in addition, to detect whether the preferred insertion site of is <dig>  dk <dig> region  <cit> , in low-copy number strains   is present or absent in high-copy number strains , a specific pair of primers was designed. moreover, the primers used to amplify locations of is <dig> in m. bovis human isolates  <cit>  were included, as the host in both cases is the same. with all these pairs of oligonucleotides we generated a primer collection  . figure  <dig> depicts the amplified regions with the primer collection  showing quite a homogeneous distribution along the m. tuberculosis genome.

locations of is <dig> in beijing genotype
all the beijing strains  presented the three characteristic is <dig> locations of beijing family: the insertion a <dig>  between rv1754c-rv1765c genes, which corresponds to deleted rd <dig>  and in the dr region . of note, two copies of is <dig>  both in the same orientation, were detected in the dr region in cam <dig> strain.

interestingly, when we compared the eight representative strains, we observed six sites of insertion present with high frequency in the genes rv <dig>  ctpd , rv <dig> and idsb , between the two is <dig> and in esxr-esxs region. these  <dig> insertion points are also present in the three reference beijing strains   <cit>  .

according to some authors, it is frequent to find at least one copy of is <dig> in the ntf region  <cit>  in strains belonging to beijing family and some members of this family may have a second insertion within this locus such as the mdr w strain  <cit> . it has been proposed that the absence of is <dig> in the ntf locus may be associated with ancestral beijing genotype sublineages  <cit>  and in the course of evolution some strains  have acquired the insertion of is <dig> in this region  <cit> . the eight analyzed strains do not present is <dig> in this region, which according to some authors, would be classified as ancestral.

distribution of is <dig> among beijing and non-beijing strains
we studied the distribution of is <dig> in the eight analysed beijing strains and in the sequenced m. tuberculosis genomes  and observed that the locations were random . however, the presence of numerous preferential integration loci of is <dig> were also detected  in beijing and non-beijing strains, corroborating favored integration regions common among m. tuberculosis strains. in all strains, this element was found within the dr region. in the non-beijing strain sumu <dig>  a copy was observed in a different point other than a <dig> in the dnaa:dnan region, indicating that the presence of an is <dig> in this region is not exclusive to the beijing family . this result is in agreement with studies which show different locations of is <dig> in the dnaa:dnan region in non-beijing strains  <cit> . the amplification of this entire intergenic region is a useful tool to detect beijing isolates, but another genomic feature of this genotype is also necessary to avoid potential false positive results.

is <dig> was found inserted more often in some genomic regions  than in others that could be more abundant in essential genes  . in fact, if an is <dig> transposes in essential regions, the outcome of this event would not be observed. these findings are in agreement with previous studies of chromosomal distribution of is <dig> <cit> .

mapping is <dig> in  <dig> hcs
with the aim of studying the is <dig> insertion points and compare them between beijing and non-beijing hcs strains, we analysed 61 m. tuberculosis clinical isolates selected for their high copy number. the isolates comprised  <dig> non-bejing and  <dig> beijing strains, including the eight previously studied in this work.

the study was carried out by pcr using the entire primer collection   and when the amplified fragment indicated that the is <dig> was present, the product was sequenced with is <dig> and is <dig> primers . by this method we obtained the two flanking regions of all the copies. by analysis of the sequences, we obtained the insertion site, the flanking 3–4 bp direct repeats , the orientation and the distance to neighboring genes of each copy of is <dig> . a total of  <dig>  insertion points were obtained  and plotted on the genomic map of h37rv and represented with dna plotter in two different circles, red  and blue  . the locations of is <dig> in the reference beijing strain gc <dig> were included in a separated circle  as reference points of insertion.

from the  <dig> analysed clinical isolates, we localized a lower number of insertion points in non-beijing strains  than in beijing strains . this finding is probably because the primer collection is based mainly in points of is <dig> from beijing strains. all strains presented one copy of is <dig> in the dr region. of the non-beijing strains,  <dig> % presented the same insertion site in this region. the remaining non-beijing strains presented a copy in different points within this region , which is in agreement with other authors who have observed  <dig> different locations within the dr region  <cit> .

other special locations that we studied in hcs were the dk <dig> insertion point and the sites of is <dig> in m. bovis clinical isolates  <cit> . according to fomukong et al.  <cit> , the dk <dig>  insertion point is highly preferred in lcs and the authors defend the idea that its prevalence decreases in hcs, suggesting a separate lineage for hcs and lcs  <cit> . no is <dig> was detected in the dk <dig> locus in all  <dig> beijing strains analysed . six of the  <dig> studied non-beijing strains presented an is <dig> in the exact dk <dig> site  . the high-copy number in these strains could be the result of transposition of another is <dig>  additionally, we found that none of the studied m. tuberculosis isolates have an equal insertion point of is <dig> as the m. bovis clinical isolates, supporting that m. bovis and m. tuberculosis evolved separately from a common precursor at an early stage.

the insertion of is <dig> in the characteristic beijing spot rd <dig> was also observed in non-beijing strains , indicating that this region is not exclusive to this family . however, comparing the insertion points in beijing and non-beijing strains, only beijing presented the deletion of rd <dig> generated by reorganization of two is <dig>  nonetheless, locations within rv <dig>  rv <dig>  ctpd, idsb genes and between the two is <dig> were only observed in beijing strains  as observed with the  <dig> beijing isolates earlier in this work. due to the high frequency of all of these is <dig> locations, these regions seem to be specific hot-spots in beijing strains. these results agree with thorne et al. that showed the presence of some insertion points conserved within genetic lineages  <cit> . with the exception of the characteristic a <dig> point, to our knowledge, this is the first time that specific insertion points are described for beijing strains, allowing us to speculate their possible relation with the fitness advantages of this family.

on the other hand unique locations were observed in papa <dig> and rv <dig> genes , interrupting mez and ppe <dig> genes  and in the intergenic region of rv1542c:rv <dig>  . we corroborated the uniqueness of these sites, after analyzing the literature  <cit> , as was the case for the copy located upstream of rv2180c gene in gc <dig>  <cit>  . the data suggests that although is <dig> has preferential genomic regions, its insertion is sufficiently random that could generate differences among strains of the same family.

is <dig> distribution in the eleven functional categories of m. tuberculosis
in the analyzed  <dig> strains, we observed that 58% of the is <dig> insertions  ocurred in orfs . the interruption of coding regions can be seen as a naturally occurring knock-out assay and could provide information on non-essential genes for mycobacteria capacity of infection in human host, as all the studied strains are clinical isolates. given that the orfs represent 91% of m. tuberculosis genome  <cit> , our data suggest that transposition is relatively more frequent in intergenic than in intragenic regions. the higher number of intergenic events is likely due to selection, as they are less probable to be deleterious than those that occur within genes. such events could increment the probability of insertion of is <dig> in possible promoter regions, which could influence the expression of neighbouring genes.

our results agree with other studies which found that 58% of discrete is <dig> insertion sites occurred within coding regions in m. tuberculosis <cit>  and in m. bovis strains  <cit> .

we observed that is <dig> does not interrupt orfs of  <dig> of the  <dig> functional categories: the stable rnas, information pathways and is and phages . only one gene, rv2103c, of the virulence category was disrupted . the distribution of the interrupted genes of the rest of the categories was markedly similar to the percentage of orfs in m. tuberculosis genome with high frequency of disrupted genes in categories of hypothetical proteins and the intermediary metabolism and respiration. the details of the distribution in the  <dig> categories are indicated in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

several studies have indicated that it is frequent to find is <dig> inserted in ppe/pe genes  <cit> . these genes are associated with antigenic variation in m. tuberculosis <cit>  but it has been suggested that the disruption of a member of this family would not be expected to produce severe disadvantages as it can be compensated by another member  <cit> . we observed that the interrupted ppe genes were ppe <dig>  ppe <dig>  ppe <dig>  ppe <dig> and ppe <dig> in several points and in both orientations and there were no disrupted pe genes . ppe <dig> has been suggested as an essential gene  <cit> , but one of the studied strains  presents a copy in it.

analysis of drs flanking is6110
after analysing the flanking sequences of each copy of is <dig> in the studied strains, we observed that 80% of the different insertion points  were flanked by drs of 3–4 bp , indicating that these were the result of transposition events. the other  <dig> copies without detected drs showed genomic reorganizations or loss of genomic regions. the deletions of rd <dig> and rd <dig> are examples of recombination between two adjacent copies of is <dig> <cit> . the is <dig> without drs localized between rv0794c:rv <dig>  is in the opposite orientation to the is <dig> in h37rv and in identical position as the copy in the reference beijing gc <dig>  <cit> , and it is associated with genomic reorganization of this region. due to the high number of copies of is <dig> per strain, it was possible to observe copies flanked by drs and other copies without drs suggesting that the probability of rearrangement between copies rises when the number of those increases, producing more variability among strains. this finding is in agreement with different studies indicating that strains with a high number of is <dig> copies have lost genomic regions more often than strains with only few copies  <cit> . although in some of the studied hcs the number of the located is <dig> copies was less than  <dig>  some of them were observed without drs, corroborating the idea that the probability of rearrangement processes between copies rises when the number increases. this is in agreement with other studies which localized is <dig> in lcs and observed that all copies were flanked by drs  <cit> . in one copy of is <dig> we detected drs of  <dig> nucleotides .

twenty percent of the located copies of is <dig> in the studied strains could act as mobile promoter
as we reported previously in this work, is <dig> is relatively more frequent in intergenic regions, increasing its probability of being inserted in promotor regions, influencing the expression of neighbouring genes. different studies have indicated that when is <dig> is inserted in the same orientation as, and close enough to, a downstream gene could potentially function as a promoter  <cit> . the orientation of the  <dig> located copies of is <dig> in the  <dig> strains and the distance to the close genes were analysed in order to test the promoter function of this element. thirty-two locations of is <dig> were located close enough to  and in the same orientation as the neighboring gene . of the  <dig> candidate locations to act as a mobile promoter,  <dig> of them were observed at a frequency of  <dig> % and  <dig> at  <dig> %. the remaining  <dig> locations were observed in a higher number of strains with  <dig> of these locations observed in non-beijing strains and  <dig> in beijing strains . of note, one of the two frequent locations among beijing strains corresponds to the copy located in ctpd gene and upstream rv1468c gene and it has already been demonstrated that this copy is acting as a promoter inside monocytes  <cit> . the fact that this location is quite frequent in beijing genotype and even is specific of this family, could be one of the special features of the beijing family in terms of virulence and transmission.

two of the  <dig> strains presented a copy of is <dig> in the promoter region of phop gene . the multidrug resistant  strain m. bovis b or mbz responsible for large tuberculosis outbreaks in spain has a copy of is <dig> located 75 bp upstream the phop gene  <cit> . soto et al. demonstrated that this is <dig> causes an increment in the transcription of phop <cit> , which could have an important consequence as the product of this gene is an important transcriptional regulator  <cit> . one of the two strains  presents a copy of is <dig> 196 bp upstream and in the same orientation as phop gene. in this case, the phop promoter region is not interrupted, as is <dig> is inserted upstream of transcription starting points, tsp <dig> and tsp <dig>  of this gene and could also provide an additional tsp. although this point is different from that in mbz, hms  <dig> could be an interesting candidate for studying the effect of is <dig> in phop gene in a drug-susceptible m. tuberculosis strain.

generation of an accurate dendrogram based on is <dig> points of insertion
after observing that the  <dig> studied beijing strains shared a high number of locations not present in non-beijing strains, we decided to group the  <dig> clinical isolates based on their insertion points. the obtained dendrogram, using bionumerics program,  shows that beijing strains were grouped better than when using the is6110-rflp classification system . furthermore, some non-beijing strains were also grouped in families despite having very few located copies of is <dig>  this fact could indicate that probably each family has their preferential sites of insertion. however, the grouping based on is <dig> locations in non-beijing families was not perfect due to the lack of information on all their points of insertion.

the classification technique based on is <dig> insertion points developed in this study allows grouping the strains in families as spoligotyping and provides information on the clone or strain as is6110-rflp. as figure 4a shows, although is6110-rflp groups genotypes, if the is6110-rflp of a beijing strain is quite different from other beijing strains, the strain is classified as distant from the group. based on the results obtained in this study, the development of a 96-well plate with pairs of primers which amplify copies of is <dig> characteristics of each family could allow to obtain a dendrogram in one day. this pcr-based method is quick, accurate and economic and possible to complete in one day.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a detailed analysis of the locations of is <dig> in m. tuberculosis beijing genotype compared to other hcs, including the exact insertion sites, the flanking drs, the orientation and the distance of is <dig> to neighbouring genes. in general, the insertion of is <dig> is random generating inter- and intrafamily strain differences. we have obtained a dendrogram based on insertion points which differentiates the beijing genotype from the rest of the families. we describe for the first time specific insertion sites in beijing genotype. the detection of unique points for concrete clinical isolates can be used as a useful tool in the rapid diagnosis allowing the identification and differentiation of a particular strain.
