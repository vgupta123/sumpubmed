BACKGROUND
the process of sexual reproduction is a hallmark for all the major eukaryotic groups . it is believed that all asexual eukaryotes have evolved from sexual ancestors  <cit> , and it has been proposed that the last eukaryotic common ancestor  possessed the full set of genes known to be involved in meiosis . meiosis is not performed exactly in the same way in different groups: differences can be found for instance in the mechanisms of crossover formation and in the structure of the synaptonemal complex, and these differences are reflected in a variable set of meiosis-related genes  <cit> .

our understanding of the meiotic process, and consequently our knowledge of the gene repertoire required, is relatively strong for opisthokonta and plants. however, despite the fact that a number of publications have recently appeared on a variety of unicellular organisms , information on most groups that contribute to the greater part of eukaryotic diversity are still scarce.

among aquatic protists, diatoms are an important group of microalgae, as they are one of the major primary producers in freshwater and marine ecosystems  <cit>  and often dominate planktonic and benthic microalgal assemblages. they are a relatively recent lineage of unicellular organisms belonging to the sar  supergroup  <cit> . the stramenopiles include both unicellular and multicellular members, as well as phototrophic, heterotrophic and parasitic members. diatoms are the only free-living unicellular stramenopiles for which the sexual cycle can be fully controlled in the laboratory for some species  <cit> .

diatoms are divided in two major groups, centrics, with radial symmetry, and pennates, with bilateral symmetry. they are unique among unicellular eukaryotes as they are encased in intricately patterned siliceous cell walls, consisting of two halves  of which one  is slightly larger than the other . diatoms spend the majority of their life cycle as diploid cells and multiply by mitotic divisions. repeated cell divisions are, however, constrained by the inflexible arrangement of the silica wall. as a consequence of this rigid structure, diatom cells progressively decrease in size after cell division, which may lead to cell death and extinction of the clonal lineage unless large cell size is restored  <cit> . although some species have been shown to employ alternative routes to escape the progressive cell miniaturization, the majority of diatom species restore cell size via sexual reproduction  <cit> . thus, besides the fundamental goal of sexual reproduction to generate genetic diversity within a population, in diatoms the sexual phase also plays a key role in cell size restitution  <cit> .

the best studied model diatoms are thalassiosira pseudonana and phaeodactylum tricornutum, for which genome sequences are available  <cit> , and gene function can be studied with conventional tools for manipulation . in contrast to most diatoms  <cit> , sexual stages have never been observed for these two species, and laboratory strains do not reduce in size and only reproduce vegetatively. this has imposed a limitation for the study of processes related to sexual reproduction, well-documented in other diatoms  <cit> . the few examples of molecular studies include the identification, in thalassiosira weissflogii, of sex-induced genes  reported to contain epidermal growth factor -like domains, putatively encoding for components of stramenopile mastigonemes  <cit> , and investigations of the genetic basis for sex determination, in seminavis robusta, by linkage mapping  <cit> .

the rapid increase in molecular data for unicellular eukaryotes has made it possible to perform comparative genomic studies to search for genes involved specifically in meiosis, allowing to assess the evolutionary history of the molecular mechanisms underlying the sexual phase. the “meiosis detection toolkit” approach provided evidence for the conservation of several of these genes in eukaryotes  <cit> . the inventory of meiotic genes includes both genes that are known to play meiosis-specific roles and genes that are required for meiosis, but whose expression and functions are shared with non-meiotic processes . mutations in the first category of genes result in severe disruptions specific to meiosis, without documented effects on non-meiotic functions  <cit> . examples of genes included in the second category are genes related to dna replication, maintenance of chromosome structure , as well as genes related to dna repair . however, it has been shown that some genes thought to be meiosis-specific may also be conserved in parthenogenetic organisms. the expression of spo <dig>  the gene responsible for the creation of double strand breaks  in homologous chromosomes, and other meiotic genes, was detected in both cyclical and obligate parthenogenetic monogonont rotifers  <cit>  and during parthenogenesis in the microcrustacean daphnia pulex  <cit> . spo <dig> in candida albicans, and spo <dig>  hop <dig> and dmc <dig> in giardia intestinalis, have been shown to function during parasexual genetic recombination  <cit> . likewise, in the haptophyte emiliania huxleyi, genotypes that appear to have lost the ability to form haploid stages still retain spo <dig>  dmc <dig>  and rad <dig>  <cit> . thus, determining how the meiotic toolkit has been conserved in different eukaryotic lineages requires comparison of representatives for which sex and meiosis can be directly observed.table  <dig> functional roles of meiotic genes searched in the diatom genomes

gene functions are taken from malik et al.  <cit>  and from hanson et al.  <cit>  unless otherwise mentioned. genes marked with a are considered meiosis-specific genes and do not have known functions outside of meiosis



the t. pseudonana genome was included in a study assessing phylogenetic distribution of core meiotic proteins  <cit> , however, as mentioned above, this species is currently considered asexual, and further datasets have become available for other species for which sexual reproduction can be controlled in the laboratory, such as members of the pseudo-nitzschia genus  <cit> .

with the aim to improve the definition of the meiosis toolkit for diatoms, we assembled an expanded list of meiotic genes for eukaryotes  <cit>  and looked for the presence of homologs in five diatom genomes and in transcriptome sequence data. we produced an inventory of putative meiotic genes and combined this information with gene expression data for two sexually reproducing species, demonstrating that their expression is indeed increased during sexual reproduction. phylogenetic analyses for these genes revealed the presence of multiple paralogs for the rad <dig> family, the presence of two diatom homologs of spo <dig> and the presence of a single rad <dig> gene.

RESULTS
identification of meiotic genes in diatoms
homology searches for  <dig> meiotic proteins  <cit>  were performed in five diatom genomes, those of thalassiosira pseudonana, a centric species, phaeodactylum tricornutum, fragilariopsis cylindrus, pseudo-nitzschia multiseries and pseudo-nitzschia multistriata, and in the de novo transcriptome of seminavis robusta , all pennate species. the reference transcriptome for the latter species was produced using data from vegetatively as well as sexually reproducing samples.table  <dig> protein, gene model or transcript ids for the genes involved in meiosis analyzed in this study

genes marked with a are genes that do not have known functions outside meiosis. arabidopsis thaliana meiotic proteins were used as query sequence; whenever the specific query gene was not found/present in a. thaliana, saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins were used . protein ids are given for the diatom genomes available at the jgi portal, gene models ids are given for the pseudo-nitzschia multistriata genome and transcripts ids for seminavis robusta. actual gene model ids for p. multistriata include the prefix psnmu-v <dig> _aug-ev-pasav3


bcorrected gene model, nf not found, cgene model might need validation



of the  <dig> meiosis-related genes known to play roles in dna duplication, chromosome maintenance and stability, and dna repair,  <dig> were found to be present in all diatom genomes, with the exception of mus <dig> endonuclease, which could not be found in the t. pseudonana genome. of the  <dig> genes known to be exclusive to meiosis , five were detected in all the diatom genomes and the transcriptome surveyed . these genes include spo11- <dig>  a meiosis-specific gene required for the formation of double-strand breaks  in paired chromosome homologs and highly conserved throughout eukaryotic lineages  <cit> . the other four genes include mnd <dig>  whose protein product forms a heterodimer with hop <dig> and facilitates dmc <dig> dependent crossover formation  <cit> , msh <dig> and msh <dig>  whose products form a complex and are thought to stabilize crossover intermediates  <cit> , and mer <dig>  whose product is thought to function in the synaptonemal complex  <cit> . the other meiosis-specific spo <dig> gene, spo11- <dig>  and nine more meiosis-specific genes, zip <dig>  zip <dig>  zip <dig>  zip <dig>  red <dig>  hop <dig>  hop <dig>  dmc <dig> and rec <dig>  could not be identified in any of the diatom genomes. zip1- <dig>  red <dig> and hop <dig> are known to be involved in formation of the synaptonemal complex . seven other genes , known to function during dna damage repair, were not detected in our search . in a few cases the gene models retrieved were incomplete, when possible these incorrect gene models were manually corrected .

phylogenetic analyses
to support the identification of diatom homologs of the meiotic genes analyzed, we created maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for the  <dig> meiotic proteins. all the meiotic toolkit proteins of diatoms clustered together with significant bootstrap support and the branching confirmed relatedness with the respective homolog in other eukaryotes .

the rec-8/rad <dig>  spo <dig> and rad <dig> gene families were analyzed in more detail to verify hypotheses on the putative roles of the different paralogs. rad21-rec <dig> have interchangeable roles in different organisms, rec <dig> being generally required for meiosis  <cit> . a single rad21-rec <dig> homolog was identified in each diatom genome  and the sequences clustered with the mitotic rad <dig> from other eukaryotes .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of rad <dig> proteins inferred from maximum likelihood analysis. numbers on the branches indicate bootstrap support from  <dig> replicates. among-site substitution rate heterogeneity was corrected using two gamma-distributed substitution rate categories and wag with frequencies  substitution model for amino acid substitutions. diatom sequences are indicated in bold



the spo <dig> gene family has a conserved and central role in meiotic recombination  <cit> . spo11- <dig> is required for meiosis in animals. in plants, spo11- <dig> and spo11- <dig> are the meiosis-specific homologs, whereas spo11-3/top via  is involved in vegetative growth  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of spo <dig> paralogs in diatoms revealed that the two paralogs spo11- <dig> and spo11-3/top via  clustered closely to the respective spo <dig> homologs from plants .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of spo <dig> proteins inferred from maximum likelihood analysis. archaeal topoisomerase via protein sequences  were used as an out-group. numbers on the branches indicate bootstrap support from  <dig> replicates. among-site substitution rate heterogeneity was corrected using two gamma-distributed substitution rate categories and lg substitution model for amino acid substitutions. diatom sequences are indicated in bold



rad <dig> is an important gene family whose members are employed in homologous recombination during both mitotic and meiotic dna repair whereas dmc <dig> functions exclusively during meiosis  <cit> . none of the diatom rad <dig> homologs clustered with dmc <dig> representatives from other organisms . however, in some sexually reproducing organisms, such as drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans, dmc <dig> is missing and other rad <dig> homologs exert its role  <cit> . this could thus also be the case in diatoms.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of rad <dig> proteins inferred from maximum likelihood analysis. archaeal rad-a protein sequences  were used as an out-group. numbers on the branches indicate bootstrap support from  <dig> replicates. among-site substitution rate heterogeneity was corrected using two gamma-distributed substitution rate categories and lg substitution model for amino acid substitutions. diatom sequences are indicated in bold



when searching for homologs of the other members of the rad <dig> family in diatom genomes, orthologs could be found for all the sequences except for rad51-d and xrcc <dig> . the rec-a/rad <dig> domain consists of  <dig> amino acids and contains two conserved consensus motifs, walker a and walker b  <cit> , that are found in atpases and endow hydrolysis and atpase activity  <cit> . this domain was present and complete in the diatom rad <dig> proteins. for all the diatom xrcc <dig> homologs, excluding the phaeodactylum tricornutum xrcc <dig> protein  <dig>  the rad <dig> domain was predicted with low e-values. a phylogenetic analysis was performed including all diatom rad <dig> homologs . from this analysis, we found that the xrcc <dig> proteins clustered correctly with the xrcc <dig> sequences from other organisms. in addition, we found two copies of rad51-a in the two pseudo-nitzschia species and in f. cylindrus, which were named rad51-a <dig> and rad51-a <dig> 

of the members of the rec-a/rad <dig> family, rec-a has been reported to be functioning in the chloroplast  <cit> . an analysis using signalp  <dig>   <cit>  and asafind  <cit>  for the p. multistriata, t. pseudonana, and p. tricornutum protein sequences revealed the presence of a signal peptide for chloroplastic transport , supporting the hypothesis of a role for this homolog in the chloroplast rather than in the nucleus.

gene expression analyses in s. robusta
in the diatom s. robusta, which has a described and controllable sexual phase, the two mating types  can form mating pairs and reproduce sexually once they are below the sexual size threshold, which lies around 50 μm  <cit> . rna extracts from synchronized co-cultures of two s. robusta strains of opposite mating type were collected at multiple time points during meiosis  and after meiosis . the same two strains were also grown as monoclonal cultures and were collected at the same time points . gene expression changes between the sexually reproducing and the vegetatively growing cultures were assessed using rna-seq.

cpm values were extracted for the transcripts belonging to the meiotic toolkit  and normalized, after which a heatmap was constructed . for  <dig> of the transcripts considered in the present analysis, including rad <dig>  spo11- <dig>  rad51-a, rad51-b and rad51-c, expression levels were higher during meiosis when compared to the expression levels at the same time after illumination in vegetatively growing monoclonal cultures. in samples obtained from post-meiotic sexual stages, the expression of meiotic genes decreases, as expected . interestingly, the putative mitosis-specific homolog spo11-3/top via  appeared to be more abundant during auxosporulation than in other conditions. the xrcc <dig> homolog was also more expressed during auxosporulation than during meiosis, similarly to mcm <dig> and mcm <dig>  for mcm <dig>  mcm <dig> and rad <dig>  expression was increased during mating compared to the vegetatively growing samples and remained high during auxosporulation.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of the meiotic toolkit transcripts found in the transcriptome of seminavis robusta. expression values  were determined for dark-synchronized monoclonal cultures   and for dark-synchronized mixed mt+ and mt- cultures sampled at the time for meiosis  and post-meiosis . blue colour indicates down-regulation and yellow colour upregulation of expression



gene expression analyses in p. multistriata
we investigated the gene expression profile of selected meiotic genes at two time points during sexual reproduction in p. multistriata using real-time quantitative pcr . monoclonal cultures of opposite mating type were used as controls. specifically, rad <dig>  spo <dig> and rad <dig> paralogs were selected for expression analyses to assess whether there was an indication of a specific requirement for the only rad <dig> homolog and for any of the spo <dig> and rad <dig> paralogs during meiosis in this species as well. rec <dig> , spo <dig> and rad <dig> are known to be expressed early in meiotic prophase i  <cit> . at both time points, the rad <dig> transcript was significantly upregulated in the co-cultures with respect to the monoclonal cultures, clearly indicating that this gene functions during meiosis . similarly, spo11- <dig> showed significant upregulation in its transcript expression in the cultures undergoing sexual reproduction as compared to monoclonal cultures, whereas spo11-3/top via  did not show any significant change between sexually reproducing cultures and monoclonal cultures . although all of the rad <dig> homologs examined  showed higher expression during sexual reproduction at both time points investigated , significant upregulation was observed only for rad51-a <dig> and rad51-c.fig.  <dig> differential expression analysis of rad <dig>  spo <dig> and rad <dig> homologs during meiosis in pseudo-nitzschia multistriata. two time points, 13 h  and 15 h  after strains of opposite mating type were mixed together, were selected for expression analyses. dark gray bars represent experiment  <dig>  with b <dig> ) and light gray bars represent experiment  <dig>  with b <dig> ). relative fold changes, with respect to vegetatively growing cultures, in log <dig> scale, are reported on the y-axis. a gene was considered differentially expressed if its relative expression change is  <dig>  fold or greater 



discussion
the availability of genomic data from six diatom species with different life cycles has been exploited to define the set of meiotic and meiosis-related genes for this important group of stramenopile microalgae  and guided experiments to define their expression pattern during sexual reproduction in two pennate species. importantly, a functional differentiation between the two diatom spo11/top via  homologs can be hypothesized. rad <dig> and homologs of rad <dig> were also found to be more expressed in cells that were undergoing sexual reproduction in both diatoms, indicating their specific requirement during meiosis.

genes exclusive to meiosis
compared to other studies, our list of meiosis-specific genes  contained three more zip  genes, zip <dig>  zip <dig> and zip <dig>  <cit> , all reported to be required for the synaptonemal complex in budding yeast  <cit> . moreover, we list as meiosis-specific both spo11- <dig> and spo11- <dig>  therefore the total number of meiosis-specific genes increases from  <dig>  <cit>  to  <dig> . of these  <dig> genes, five were detected in all the diatom genomes surveyed . in the seminavis robusta dataset, these five genes were all clearly upregulated during mating , as was the one tested in pseudo-nitzschia multistriata . the role of sex in the ecology and biogeochemical function of natural diatom populations has been challenging to investigate with classical methods as diatom sexual stages are difficult to recognize and preserve poorly  <cit> . the genes identified in the present study might prove useful as molecular markers to detect events of diatom sexual reproduction in nature.

ten meiosis-specific genes could not be identified in any of the diatom genomes. the absence of some of these genes has also been reported for other species  and has been correlated with the presence of alternative structures and pathways required during meiotic recombination .

while duplications of some of the meiotic toolkit genes have been observed in protists and other organisms , the diatom genes were all present in single copies, except for the notable expansion observed in the rad <dig> family.

does rad <dig> function as a component of the cohesin complex both during mitosis and meiosis in diatoms and other stramenopiles?
although the smc <dig>  smc <dig>  smc <dig>  smc <dig>  smc <dig> and smc <dig> genes, whose products are functional components of the cohesin and condensin complexes , were identified in diatoms, rec <dig>  an important component of cohesin complex and meiosis-specific homolog of rad <dig>  <cit> , seemed to be absent in the diatoms investigated . gene expression analysis of the rad <dig> homolog during sexual reproduction in p. multistriata and s. robusta supports the hypothesis that rec <dig> might be substituted by rad <dig>  which would function as a component of the cohesin complex both during mitosis and meiosis . indeed, during mammalian meiosis, the mitotic rad <dig> cohesin has been shown to perform the role of rec <dig>  <cit> . on the contrary, in the ciliate tetrahymena thermophila that is lacking rad <dig>  it has been shown that rec <dig>  the meiotic homolog of rad <dig>  replaces the function of rad <dig> during mitosis  <cit> . the loss of rec <dig> appears to be a character shared by all stramenopiles .

spo11- <dig> is the meiosis-specific spo <dig> paralog
spo <dig>  encoding a conserved protein involved in dna dsbs formation and thus in initiation of homologous recombination, was found to have two paralogs in diatoms, spo11- <dig> and spo11-3/top via . in many plants, including arabidopsis thaliana, three paralogs of spo <dig> have been reported, of which spo11- <dig> and spo11- <dig> are meiosis-specific, while spo11-3/top via  has a topoisomerase function as it interacts with topoisomerase vib  and is required during vegetative growth  <cit> . however, most animals, insects and yeasts possess the meiosis-specific spo11- <dig> homolog  <cit>   and lack the other counterpart of topoisomerase assembly, the top vib homolog  <cit> . in diatoms, red algae and prasinophytes, the spo11- <dig> gene seems to be lost, although the spo11- <dig> and spo11-3/top via  homologs are conserved  <cit> . although functional differentiation between spo11- <dig> and spo11- <dig> is not fully resolved in plants, in a. thaliana spo11- <dig> mutants the male and female meiosis is severely disrupted, while the mutation does not affect vegetative growth  <cit> . this suggests that spo11- <dig> is involved in meiotic recombination. similar to many plants, it had been hypothesized that the spo11- <dig> homolog in diatoms is involved in meiosis, while the product of spo11-3/top via  homolog may interact with the top vib subunit and might be involved in vegetative growth  <cit> . the present study demonstrated that spo11- <dig> mrna levels were significantly upregulated during sexual reproduction in p. multistriata and s. robusta, providing the first experimental evidence for the functional distinction between spo <dig> paralogs in diatoms. gene expression studies in the centric diatom thalassiosira weissflogii also revealed the meiosis-specific role of spo11- <dig> . spo11- <dig> is absent in all members of the stramenopiles analyzed to date, and might have been lost early in the divergence of the alveolate and stramenopile lineages.

homologous recombination and strand exchange in the absence of dmc1
archaeal rad-a homologs rad <dig> and dmc <dig> work collectively in homology search and strand exchange processes during meiotic recombination, although it is unclear how they cooperate  <cit> . however, in mitotic cells only rad <dig> is induced and carries out recombination  <cit> . tsubouchi et al.  <cit>  have proposed two different pathways of homology searching during meiosis. in the first pathway, dmc <dig> and rad <dig> act together with hop <dig> and other accessory proteins to accomplish efficient homology searching. in budding yeast, mutation in the hop <dig> gene results in inappropriate homology searching, leading to extensive synaptonemal complex formation between non-homologous chromatids  <cit> . in this dmc1-dependent pathway, hop <dig> interacts with mnd <dig> downstream of dmc <dig> and rad <dig> homology searching, with hop <dig> being a major dna binding protein and mnd <dig> the foremost protein interacting with rad <dig>  <cit> . in the second pathway, only rad <dig> is involved in homology searching. the same study  <cit>  also reported that overexpression of rad <dig> suppresses defects in dmc <dig> mutants, indicating rad <dig> can carry out effective homology searching independently. crismani et al.  <cit>  recently reported that in arabidopsis rad <dig> can work together with mcm <dig> to repair meiotic double strand breaks when the dmc1-dependent major repair pathway fails. the mcm family of dna helicases consists of nine homologs of which six  are conserved across the eukaryotic kingdom and function as heterohexamer helicase in dna replication  <cit> , whereas the other three  are less conserved, with mcm8-mcm <dig> being proved to work during meiotic recombination  <cit> . mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> form a stable complex and promote recruitment of rad <dig> to the dna damage sites  <cit> . although diatoms lack dmc <dig> and hop <dig> genes, they possess five to six homologs of rad <dig>  and mcm <dig> and mcm <dig>  in a. thaliana, rad51-c and xrcc <dig> have been shown to be involved in meiotic recombination  <cit> . in p. multistriata, we observed that rad51-a <dig> and rad51-c were upregulated during sexual reproduction, and in s. robusta rad51-a, rad51-b and rad51-c appeared to be upregulated during sexual reproduction. based on the rna-seq data produced for s. robusta, mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> also appeared upregulated during meiosis . intriguingly, a homolog of the hop <dig> gene, whose protein product forms a heterodimer with mnd <dig>  could not be found, while mnd <dig> was found in diatoms. either hop <dig> is highly diverged in diatoms and is currently beyond the detection by homology searches or another mechanism involving mnd <dig> exists, as the s. robusta homolog is indeed up-regulated during meiosis. therefore, diatoms may have evolved an alternative meiotic double strand break repair pathway that does not involve dmc <dig>  absence of dmc <dig>  hop <dig> and mnd <dig> homologs has been reported for certain sexually reproducing organisms such as caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster and neurospora crassa  and absence of hop <dig> has been reported in gallus gallus, phytophthora species, and some fungi  <cit> . as dmc <dig> and hop <dig> orthologs were identified in the ectocarpus siliculosus genome but not in sexual diatoms, the losses of a dmc <dig> dependent dsb repair pathway and of hop <dig> might be specific to certain lineages of stramenopiles and do not correlate with obligate asexuality.

does cross-over occur without canonical synaptonemal complex  in diatoms?
the synaptonemal complex , a proteinaceous structure, is developed during early prophase i of meiosis and is thought to juxtapose homologous chromatids to enhance crossing over during meiotic recombination  <cit> . almost all animals, plants and fungi capable of meiosis possess the sc  <cit> . the zmm  group of proteins includes seven functionally similar yet structurally diverse proteins that coordinate recombination events and sc formation during meiosis  <cit> . functionally, zmm proteins can be categorized into three subgroups. subgroup i includes mer <dig> and msh4-msh <dig>  subgroup ii includes zip <dig>  zip <dig> and zip <dig> while subgroup iii includes the zip <dig> protein. the zip <dig> protein produces a stable connection between two homologous chromosomes  <cit> , zip <dig>  zip <dig> and zip <dig> facilitate protein-protein interactions  <cit>  and mer <dig>  msh <dig> and msh <dig> promote dna recombination  <cit> . however, homologs of zip <dig> among fungi , animals  and plants  are highly divergent. similarly, the other zip proteins have functional analogues in fungi , animals  and plants  albeit with very low or no sequence similarity among different taxa. the diatom genomes contained neither identifiable homologs of zip genes , nor of hop <dig> and red <dig>  the components of lateral elements in scs  and thus, diatoms may lack canonical scs. such a possibility was proposed for ciliates. in ciliate genomes, none of the genes related to canonical scs were detected  <cit>  and the corresponding absence of a canonical sc in the ciliate tetrahymena thermophila was also supported by microscopic observations  <cit> . the presence of a rigid siliceous frustule and dense ring of chromatin around the central spindle at metaphase make it difficult to perform routine cytological studies in diatoms  <cit> , however, in some species sc-like structures have been reported  <cit> , so sc-like structures might involve unidentified proteins that have replaced the zip and hop <dig> protein functions. alternatively, the homologous proteins are present in diatoms but have diverged so much that they are unrecognizable.

dna mismatch repair genes 
the msh gene family comprises homologs of bacterial muts genes that are important for dna mismatch recognition and repair . msh genes have been reported in all eukaryotes and are fundamentally involved in the initial recognition of nucleotide mismatch during repair  <cit> . although seven msh homologs  have been identified among eukaryotes, msh <dig> and msh <dig> are less conserved  <cit> . msh proteins form heterodimers, msh2-msh <dig> is principally involved in mmr during mitosis whereas msh4-msh <dig> functions during meiosis  <cit> , stabilizing single strand invasion intermediates formed during early stages of meiotic recombination  <cit> . further, it directs holliday junction resolution towards crossover formation following an interference sensitive pathway  <cit> . t-dna insertional mutation of msh <dig> of arabidopsis exhibits reduced fertility with no effects on normal vegetative growth  <cit> . msh <dig>  msh <dig>  msh <dig> and msh <dig> were identified in all diatom genomes investigated and they were upregulated during meiosis in s. robusta indicating the presence of a complete and active mmr machinery.

prokaryotic mutl homologs  of dna mmr proteins are another important group of conserved meiotic genes that work in coordination with msh homologs. multiple copies of mlh homologs  are present in eukaryotes  <cit> . mlh <dig> and pms1/ <dig> form heterodimers and interact with msh2-msh <dig> or msh4-msh <dig> heterodimers to remove dna mismatches during replication  <cit> . msh heterodimers initiate dna mmr by recognizing and binding to unpaired and impaired bases. in addition, they activate the mlh complex endonuclease that further incises dna mismatches  <cit> . mlh1-pms <dig> is the major heterodimer and in some eukaryotes the mlh family contains multiple homologs   <cit> . diatoms contain mlh <dig> and pms <dig> whereas mlh <dig> and mlh <dig> were not detected, suggesting that the mlh1-pms <dig> complex plays a major role in mmr in diatoms. the latter hypothesis is supported by the upregulation of both genes during mating in s. robusta. although mlh <dig> was not detected in other sar supergroup members examined, as is the case for diatoms, an mlh <dig> homolog was detected in e. siliculosus, suggesting that mmr varies among stramenopiles.

the meiotic toolkit in p. tricornutum and t. pseudonana
centric and pennate diatoms differ in many aspects of their life cycles, and meiosis also differs in many ways, with a different number of gametes produced in pennates  with respect to centrics   <cit> . nevertheless, our results suggest that the molecular machinery employed in meiotic recombination may be shared by all diatom species studied. this includes p. tricornutum and t. pseudonana for which a sexual phase has never been reported. differences could only be found for the rad <dig> family, where p. multistriata, p. multiseries and f. cylindrus appeared to have a duplicated rad51-a gene, a canonical version of xrcc <dig> appeared to be present only in p. tricornutum, while t. pseudonana lacked mus <dig> 

this would suggest that the apparent lack of a sexual phase for p. tricornutum and t. pseudonana is unlikely due to major losses in the meiotic toolkit genes. in spite of the rapid evolution of the genomes of these two diatoms and the presence of a significant amount of transposable elements in their genomes, the meiotic genes are conserved. since meiotic genes have been reported in the genome of asexual organisms  <cit> , it cannot be excluded that these diatom species are truly asexual, with meiosis-related genes having undergone neo-functionalization and becoming employed in non-meiotic processes such as dna repair. moreover, detailed analyses should include an assessment of the integrity of the meiosis-related genes identified, to rule out a recent accumulation of mutations rendering the genes non-functional . for example, the meiotic spo11- <dig> homolog in the t. pseudonana genome appeared to be missing the n-terminal portion of the gene found in other diatoms . the presence of meiosis related genes in the genome of t. pseudonana, even if some genes may be subject to recent loss-of-function mutations , suggests that some members of the species may have retained this capacity, as seen recently in the coccolithophore emiliania huxleyi  <cit> . however, at least for p. tricornutum, which is a pennate diatom , few strains have been used in laboratories across the world and it could be that the right mating partner has never been used in crossing experiments. this species is both important for fundamental research and promising in biotechnology, and the ability to conduct laboratory breeding would greatly enhance this potential. the isolation of additional wild type p. tricornutum strains should be pursued in order to verify if sexual reproduction can be induced in the laboratory.

CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the meiotic toolkit in diatoms revealed that the majority of meiosis-related genes are present and, in two species tested, showed an expression consistent with their proposed role. however, it seems that not all eukaryotic meiosis-specific genes are required to complete meiosis in diatoms. specifically, our results suggest the presence of a dmc1-independent pathway for double strand break repair during meiosis in diatoms. the absence of the genes required for canonical sc formation in diatoms may explain why the sc has not been seen during meiotic divisions. the assignment of specific functional roles to the meiosis-related genes in diatoms, for comparison to roles of homologous proteins in yeasts, plants, and animals, will need further investigation using various approaches, including reverse genetics and protein interaction analyses. more broadly, the presented data refine our knowledge of patterns of evolutionary divergence of meiosis, a fundamental process ancestral to all extant eukaryotes. the sar supergroup has undergone fundamental modifications to the meiosis process compared to other representatives of both the diaphoretickes/bikont megaclade  and the amorphea/unikont megaclade . features common among the sar members are the absence of mlh <dig> and xrs2/nbs <dig> in dna damage sensing and the loss of components involved in canonical sc formation. within the stramenopiles there is also a general trend to lose canonical components in meiotic recombination, some of which have occurred in specific branches, and in some cases the meiosis-specific components may have been replaced by distant homologs with known mitotic functions.
