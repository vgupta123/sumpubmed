BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria are an ancient lineage of morphologically diverse bacteria that fundamentally shaped our planet through the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and they continue to play an important role in the global nitrogen and carbon cycles
 <cit> . cyanobacteria are prolific producers of notorious toxins
 <cit> . these include potent hepatotoxins and neurotoxins such as microcystins, anatoxins and saxitoxins produced by aquatic bloom-forming cyanobacteria around the world. they are also a promising source of natural products with relevance to drug development and biotechnological exploitation
. the chemical structure of natural products is often characterized from particular cyanobacterial isolates or consortia sampled from the environment and the biosynthetic origins of the major toxins produced by cyanobacteria in marine or fresh waters have now been elucidated
. however, it is clear that cyanobacteria typically encode additional natural products
.

in a recent effort of better representing the cyanobacterial phylum at the genomic level, we initiated the genetic potential for the secondary metabolite production in cyanobacteria
 <cit> . this preliminary study confirmed the impressive potential for natural product production across the entire cyanobacterial lineage as 70% of the cyanobacterial genomes contained the polyketide synthase  and nonribosomal peptide synthetase  pathways or hybrids thereof. the nrps and pks are two classes of large modular enzymes in which modules incorporate building blocks into the growing chain like in an assembly line. interestingly, cyanobacteria dedicated about 5% of their genomes for these pathways, with an average of five nrps/pks clusters per genome
 <cit> .

the current understanding of the diversification of these pathways is largely based on the knowledge acquired from studies focused on the biosynthesis of few compounds mostly linked to nrps/pks pathways. from an evolutionary perspective, some cyanotoxins appeared vertically inherited throughout the phylum i.e. microcystin/nodularin family
 <cit> , while others such as saxitoxins resulted from multiple horizontal gene transfers 
 <cit> . on a more global scale, early phylogenetic analyses of these genes acting collectively promoted the importance of hgt to explain their conservation in different bacterial lineages as well as multiple gene duplications and gene loss with vertical inheritance to understand the domain evolution of the pks pathways
. despite the multiplication of chemical characterizations of specific compounds coupled with genomic investigation and examples from various bacterial lineages, the biosynthetic origins of the natural products mostly remain unknown. on the other hand, there is a true need to understand the way these pathways evolve notably to produce natural product-like by joining functionally subclusters and enzymes through construction of novel artificial biological pathways.

here we performed a large-scale analysis of cyanobacterial natural product pathways by combining genomic data with genetic information for biosynthesis of specific compounds as well as on genetic conservation of the domains of these genes. several additional gene cluster families were distinguished, among which some of the compounds produced are likely specialized for basic cell functions, like chelating iron from surrounding environment or contributing to the final maturation of the heterocyst. this first phylum-level investigation allowed identification of different evolutionary forces that shape the metabolic diversity of natural products in an ancient lineage of bacteria. in addition to these insights, our data provide a genetic framework for the chemical characterization of these compounds for biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications.

RESULTS
identification of nrps/pks pathways
genomic analysis identified  <dig> biosynthetic gene clusters including  <dig> nrps,  <dig> pks, and  <dig> hybrid gene clusters encoding both nrps and pks enzymes from  <dig> cyanobacteria out of the  <dig> genomes of the cyanogeba dataset covering the diversity of the phylum
 <cit>  . the pks contain at least one ketosynthase domain and belong to type i modular systems, subdivided into cis- and transacyl transferase, and type i iterative pkss, as well as type iii pkss
 <cit> . furthermore, various mixed polyketide pathways were found such as type i/type iii pkss. the nrps contain either a typical nrps with, minimally, adjacent condensation and adenylation domains or a nrps-like lacking of condensation domain
 <cit> . hybrids contain pks linked to nrps modules, which results in the production of polyketide–peptide hybrid metabolites.table  <dig> 
nrps/pks gene clusters and cluster families


gene clusters encoding nrps, pks and hybrid nrps/pks were found in  <dig> out of  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes . several gene clusters were shared among cyanobacteria, forming cluster families . some cfs correspond to biosynthetic pathways of known products, whereas others without associated products were recovered using blastp and a transitive link criterion to build families. the other half of the gene clusters were orphans, each forming a putative family by its own.



to further analyse this exceptionally rich metabolic gene set, we aimed to identify groups of gene clusters related to each other. we combined similarity results of the comparisons of protein sequences of the  <dig> clusters against each other with synteny conservation parameters in order to gather similar pathways into gene cluster families  that potentially encode for megasynthetases involved in the biosynthesis of closely related metabolites. this method allowed the identification of cf of known natural product pathways, such as anabaenopeptin and nodulapeptin clusters involved in the synthesis of large family of cyclic hexapeptide with a conserved d-lys and ureido linkage
 <cit> . we also obtained one cf gathering microcystin and nodularin pathways, both involved in the biosynthesis of peptides harbouring the characteristic c <dig> amino acid, 3-amino-9-methoxy- <dig> ,8-trimethyl- <dig> phenyl- <dig> -decadienoic acid 
 <cit> . in addition, clusters of different lengths but involved in the biosynthesis of variants of a compound, i.e. clusters of aeruginosin of  <dig> to 25 kb-long with an amino-acid sequence identity as low as 55%, were grouped within the same cf. this method also permitted the identification of families of related gene clusters when the latter were fragmented on different contigs as one might expect in unfinished genomes.

pathway diversity in cyanobacteria
we mapped the distribution of the cfs onto the species tree of cyanobacteria to track for their diversity and their distribution in the phylum . interestingly, only 20% of the gene clusters could be assigned to the described biosynthetic pathway of a natural product belonging to a group of known chemical compounds , indicating a rich diversity of new chemical scaffolds. these assigned groups comprise  <dig> gene clusters belonging to  <dig> cfs, which encode multi-enzymatic proteins involved in the synthesis of well-described bioactive compounds, such as protease inhibitors, uv sunscreen agents, and toxins . most of these gene clusters exhibit a patchy taxonomic distribution throughout the cyanobacterial lineage. but there were two noticeable exceptions of pks pathways found in genomes of clades g and h, respectively, containing all types of cyanobacterial morphologies:  the cf- <dig> predicted to be involved in the production of hydrocarbons;  the cf- <dig> involved in the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids . also, the genomic analysis combined with metabolic characterisation highlighted more variability in the biosynthetic clusters of well-known toxins as examplified by anatoxin-a  and microcystin . the cf- <dig> gathers three clusters coding for anatoxin-a biosynthesis identified in four strains. the one present in the potent neurotoxin producing strain cylindrospermum sp. pcc  <dig> contained in addition an oxidoreductase  and a truncated anag leading to the production of dihydroanatoxin-a as the major variant . the microcystin biosynthetic cluster in fischerella sp. pcc  <dig> and the detection of microcystin-lr in this strain confirm the presence of this hepatotoxin family in the most complex morphotypes of the cyanobacteria .figure  <dig>

regarding the 80% of the  <dig> gene clusters associated with the biosynthetic pathway of unknown compound,  <dig> of the gene clusters were grouped into  <dig> additional cfs based on their similarity and shared gene content by applying the same classification . the remaining  <dig> gene clusters not known to be involved in particular compound biosynthesis and not related to each other were considered to be unique orphan gene clusters, each of them representing putatively independent cfs . among the uncharacterized cfs, the pks cf- <dig> was found widely distributed in the marine or fresh water picocyanobacteria of the clade d, which appeared rather depleted of other nrps/pks gene clusters.

thus, the initial  <dig> gene clusters grouped into  <dig> cfs. as for several examples of nrps/pks clusters, these cfs are potentially involved in biosynthesis pathways. however, some pathways may not be functional while others produce notorious compounds or even known compounds for which the biosynthesis has not yet been investigated. a rank-abundance curve describing the distribution of the cf among our dataset reveals that most of the cfs sharing highly similar gene content in synteny are spread only into  <dig> to  <dig> genomes, and one up to  <dig> strains . the long tail consisting of orphan cfs unique to each genome evidenced a high diversity of the nrps/pks gene clusters in cyanobacteria and a largest one to discover with function of further sequencing effort. the  <dig> orphan cfs are distinct from the shared cfs by their size as they are limited to their single version of nrps/pks genes without any tailoring enzyme. but despite their smaller mean size, their number is likely not overestimated as they are similarly occurring in complete and unfinished genomes .

pathway distribution in the cyanobacterial phylum
the analysis of the gene cluster distribution at the cyanobacterial phylum level showed that there are more genomes harboring nrps/pks gene clusters in the late branches of the species tree  than in the early ones . in addition, the percentage of genome devoted to encode these gene clusters is higher in the late-branching part of the cyanobacterial lineage . on average, there are  <dig>  clusters per genome in the late branches compared to  <dig> clusters per genome in the early ones .figure  <dig> 
proportion of nrps/pks genes clusters in cyanobacterial genomes and their closest homologs. a. percent of genome dedicated to encode nrps/pks gene clusters highlights the burst in the late-branching clades in comparison to the early-branching ones of the phylogenetic species tree , b. distribution of the blast hits of the  <dig> proteins contained in the  <dig> clusters compared to the non-redundant database of ncbi .



up to  <dig> of the  <dig> nrps/pks gene cluster families are shared among closely related strains as exemplified by the cf- <dig>  cf- <dig>  cf- <dig> and cf- <dig> present in cyanothece sp. atcc  <dig> and atcc <dig>  and the cf- <dig>  cf- <dig>  cf- <dig>  cf- <dig>  cf- <dig> and cfs-47- <dig> found in oscillatoria spp. pcc  <dig> and pcc  <dig> , and indicated a vertical inheritance of the gene clusters from their common ancestors. the simultaneous occurrence of several common cfs was found between groups of two to three cyanobacteria only. at the phylum level, only three pks cfs  are more widely shared by cyanobacteria of the same phylogenetic clades, e.g. d, g, and h, coherent with a vertical inheritance and some subsequent losses. on the other hand, all ten cfs of crocosphaera watsonni wh <dig>  the six cfs of coleofasciculus chthonoplastes pcc  <dig> or the only cf of acaryochloris marina mbic <dig> located on one of its plasmids were present only in those genomes of the analysed dataset. therefore, we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis of the  <dig> pathways , which indicated a species clustering not coherent with the species phylogeny , and thus confirms that the nrps/pks gene clusters widely spread in this dataset are likely not vertically inherited as a whole in the phylum.

blast analyses of the proteins of the  <dig> clusters against the non-redundant database of ncbi indicated that the closest homologs are always found within the cyanobacteria. however, 89% of the proteins of the clusters also have homologs in other bacteria well-known for their nrps and pks content such as the proteobacteria, firmicutes or actinobacteria
 <cit>  . while the nrps and pks gene clusters are widespread in several bacterial phyla, 11% of the biosynthetic proteins encoded in the  <dig> clusters have hits only in the cyanobacterial phylum. these cyanobacteria-specific proteins correspond to non-nrps/pks proteins composing the clusters, suggesting that the specificity of the cyanobacterial nrps/pks clusters relies on accessory proteins such as tailoring enzymes involved in the maturation of the produced peptide.

evolution of the pathways
the impact of hgt on the evolution of these pathways at the phylum level is difficult to estimate due to the complexity of our dataset. dinucleotide signature analysis of the clusters distinguished  <dig> clusters with atypical genomic signature . among them,  <dig> are particularly biased , suggesting an external acquisition from a distantly related organism, notably cf- <dig> in synechococcus sp. wh <dig>  cf- <dig> in fischerella sp. pcc  <dig>  cf- <dig> in cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cs- <dig>  cf- <dig> in wh <dig> and  <dig> orphan clusters in diverse cyanobacterial morphotypes. in addition, cf- <dig> in synechococcus sp. wh <dig> and cf- <dig> in fischerella sp. pcc  <dig> showed a gc% deviation on their full length .figure  <dig> 
nrps/pks genes clusters in cyanobacteria: mobility, gene cluster size, proportion of gc% deviated genes and dinucleotide average absolute relative abundance difference. the size of the  <dig> gene clusters is indicated for each strain with their corresponding percentage of genes presenting below a gc% deviation and dinucleotide average absolute relative abundance difference  and above associated with presence of mobility traces in their genomic context. the genomes are ordered accordingly to the phylogenetic tree presented in figure 
 <dig> 



moreover, 4% of the gene clusters, with sizes up to 58 kb, are present on plasmids  representing potential vectors for hgt. also a detailed examination of the genomic context of the nrps/pks gene clusters indicated that 26% are surrounded by or contain genes encoding mobile elements  potentially involved in hgt, which impact  <dig> of the  <dig> genomes harbouring these gene clusters. it concerned 63% of the genomes in the late-branching clades of the phylogenetic cyanobacterial tree and only 25% in the early-branching clades . it has to be noted that most of the mobile elements identified are highly degraded and correspond likely to gene remnants. most, if not all, of the gene clusters of eleven genomes  are surrounded by traces of mobile elements in their genomic context or are present on plasmid. altogether,  <dig> clusters have mobility traces and/or are located on plasmids, among which  <dig> clusters showed also an atypical dinucleotide signature. interestingly,  <dig> of those are occurring in the genomes of the late-branching lineages.

however, hgt might not be the main driving force acting on the evolution of nrps/pks gene clusters in cyanobacteria. an analysis of the phylogenies of the nrps condensation  and pks ketoacyl synthase  domains supported complex evolution with a domain diversification that suggests the incorporation of diverse substrates . while the phylogeny of c domains found in our dataset  showed clustering into previously described c-domain subtypes, the phylogenetic analysis of ks domains revealed the supported clustering of all ks involved in pufa and enediyne biosynthesis . a close examination of the clusters composing our cfs highlights different evolutionary scenarios. the clusters of cf- <dig> , cf- <dig> or cf- <dig> showed a conservation of gene order and content . on the contrary in cf- <dig>  cf- <dig>  and cf- <dig> , the clusters went through more complex evolution schemes involving gene duplication, indels and/or inversions as well as domain deletion/substitution. the ks and c domains phylogenies of cf- <dig> showed strong synteny conservation in filamentous cyanobacteria , counter-balanced by events of gene shuffling, domain recombination and duplication during the evolution in heterocystous and unicellular cyanobacteria .figure  <dig>

further roles for secondary metabolites in cyanobacteria
most secondary metabolite pathways are not linked to the cyanobacterial lifestyle in their environments e.g. marine vs fresh water, but some obviously benefit to the harbouring organisms to cope with their habitats. in our dataset, two examples covering several cyanobacterial genomes illustrate such benefice.

the first example concerns the pks pufa gathered in cf- <dig> which are involved in the production of heterocyst glycolipids as the last maturation step of the heterocyst rendering it impermeable to oxygen produced by adjacent cells, and thus, able to fix atmospheric nitrogen
 <cit> . the evolutionary data of the pks pufa within cyanobacteria clearly supported their vertical inheritance, as the ks pufa were forming a supported and large monophyletic clade with the enedyine ks in the ks phylogenetic tree . comparison of these ks with homologs from other bacteria
 <cit>  supported six cyanobacterial ks clades . the first and second ks of the cf- <dig>  cf- <dig> and cf- <dig>  highlighted in orange, pink, yellow and blue of the phylogenetic tree and in the gene cluster schemes , emerged by duplication. moreover, they are closely related to their counterparts in other phyla, so that the first ks of cf- <dig> and cf- <dig>  and the second ks of cf- <dig>  are related to those in γ-proteobacteria and flavobacterium, while the two first kss of cf- <dig>  are more closely related to those in actinobacteria. the ks enediyne clade in grey is basal to the monophyletic group comprising the first and second ks of cf- <dig>  cf- <dig> and cf- <dig>  finally, the last ks of the cf- <dig> and cf- <dig> represented in green colour diverged earlier from these, as did other terminal ks from pufa clusters in planctomycetes and δ-proteobacteria.figure  <dig>

the second example obtained from the examination of the genomic context of the  <dig> gene clusters resulted in the identification of  <dig> gene clusters containing genes related to siderophore transport systems and suggesting the involvement of nrps/pks gene clusters in siderophores production . this findings was unexpected, as only a few siderophores were previously characterized in cyanobacteria, and mostly linked to the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides  like for synechobactin a-c in synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> and schizokinen in anabaena species
 <cit> . we analysed a 34 kb-long nrps/pks gene cluster present in anabaena cylindrica pcc  <dig> potentially involved in biosynthesis of anachelin  <dig> , supporting the wider siderophore potential hypothesis in cyanobacteria. the catecholate siderophore anachelin is a peptide alkaloid initially characterized from a non-axenic co-identical strain of pcc  <dig>  anabaena cylindrica ccap 1403/2a, and confirmed in anabaena cylindrica nies 19
 <cit> . this nrps/pks gene cluster in pcc  <dig> comprised  <dig> genes with a nrps architecture in agreement with the assembly of the characteristic three hydrophilic amino acids  and the two units responsible for binding iron  of the anachelin  <dig> structure as sketched from earliest structural study
 <cit> . in addition, the genetic analysis allowed identifying the presence of genes  <dig> to  <dig> as candidates for the biosynthesis of the salicylate starter unit, genes  <dig> and  <dig> participate in the atha biosynthesis , genes  <dig> and  <dig> encode l-thr-d-ser-l-ser, genes 11- <dig> encode the dmaq production, followed by genes  <dig> to  <dig> which encode an efflux protein, a thioredoxin-like protein, a siderophore-binding protein and a siderophore receptor respectively. in addition to the anachelin cluster in anabaena cylindrica pcc  <dig>  we identified in the nodularia sp. ccy  <dig> genome an ortholog to clusters encoding compounds with siderophore activity in nostoc sp. pcc 7120
 <cit>  and in agrobacterium tumefaciens c58
 <cit> . this in-silico analysis allows predicting a widespread potential of siderophores not previously anticipated, and implies iron uptake mechanisms to be further explored for cyanobacteria.figure  <dig>

discussion
cyanobacteria are a prolific source of natural products, many of which have complex chemical structures
 <cit> . the large-scale genomic analysis at the phylum-level presented here shows an impressive genetic diversity underlying known and cryptic cyanobacterial metabolism. indeed, the  <dig> distinct nrps/pks gene cluster families found in this dataset will increase as other already known pathways described in previous works on cyanobacteria are not represented in the present study. often highlighted through human health hazard point of view, the clusters encoding major toxins, protease inhibitors and other known bioactive compounds are not predominant in these pathways. most of the cfs seems to be spread in various groups throughout the phylum, but closely related cyanobacteria shared also similar cf patterns
 <cit> . in our dataset, only three pks pathways were more largely disseminated within a given group of cyanobacteria  coherent with a vertical inheritance and some subsequent losses, and presumably giving them a certain benefit. however, the diversification and the large distribution of the nrps/pks gene clusters are inconsistent with global vertical inheritance followed by repeated losses in the current lineages as observed for some of the toxins
 <cit> .

different mechanisms impacted the evolution of these gene clusters in cyanobacteria shown by the cf- <dig> and cf- <dig> largely distributed in a given clade but also spread discretely in other clades. cf- <dig> was vertically inherited from the root to the clade h to enable spatial nitrogen fixation to heterocystous cyanobacteria. on the contrary, the cf- <dig> largely spread in clade g has been inherited partially in fischerella sp. pcc  <dig> by hgt. indeed, the lack of the two last enzymes of the cf- <dig> pathway in this heterocystous strain suggests the non-production of hydrocarbon. thus, in addition to cfs vertically inherited, others presented a more complex evolutionary history.

we noticed only a few obvious hgt in cyanobacteria and mainly the lack of gene context conservation in any of the presently defined cfs contrarily to the observed exchange of pathways incorporated into genomic islands for salinospora
 <cit> . thus, despite genomic islands in one picocyanobacterial group
 <cit>  and 26% of the genomic context of our pathways with degraded mobile elements, there is no insertion hotspot facilitating the incorporation of nrps and pks genes in cyanobacteria.

we observed a clear burst of nrps/pks pathways in the late-branching cyanobacteria, which devote a larger part of their genome to these pathways. in addition, about 9% of pathways in the late-branching cyanobacteria have mobility traces and/or are located on plasmids and show a deviation in their dinucleotide signature. mobile elements might have allowed hgt and/or recombination events. this suggests also that hgt events explain partly the burst of nrps/pks gene clusters in the late-branching cyanobacterial clades, which is in agreement with the increase of gene number in the genomes of this lineage
 <cit> . however, the highly degraded state of the mobile elements in the cf’s surroundings suggests also that many of these events were ancient.

distantly related cyanobacteria present strongly conserved cfs such as cf- <dig> for anatoxin biosynthesis found in oscillatoria spp. pcc  <dig> and pcc  <dig> and in cylindropsermum stagnale pcc  <dig>  or cf- <dig> present in nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig> and microcystis sp. nies- <dig>  but contain also rearranged cfs that underwent drastic gene shuffling events such as cf- <dig> for microcystin synthesis in microcystis sp. pcc  <dig> and fischerella sp. pcc  <dig> and cf- <dig> in unicellular, filamentous and heterocystous cyanobacteria. moreover, the tailoring enzymes involved in the maturation of the peptide seem to be more specific to cyanobacteria than the nrps/pks genes. therefore, gene shuffling combined to specific tailoring enzymes participated to the chemical originality of secondary metabolites in cyanobacteria and could explain the diversification of these pathways in the whole phylum.

the adaptation and fitness of bacteria depends on their genomic potential for providing various strategies to cope with stressful and changing environments. the ecological function of secondary metabolites is unclear despite continual expression of some clusters, which appear more involved in the physiology of the producing organism
 <cit> . in this dataset also, we evidenced nrps/pks gene clusters that might have alternative and adaptive functions notably in heterocystous cyanobacteria to boost their primary metabolism with specific pks pufa pathways dedicated to heterocyst glycolipids. indeed, as the cf- <dig> and cf- <dig> clusters are present in gloeobacter violaceaus pcc  <dig> at the root of the cyanobacterial phylum, and the ks of these two cfs emerged the same way than in other bacteria, it is likely that these clusters predate the cyanobacteria. cf- <dig> was subsequently kept in the heterocystous clade for the heterocyst maturation and the advantage of nitrogen fixation without inhibition of oxygen resulting from photosynthesis. further, the heterocystous cyanobacteria developed the cf- <dig> by module loss from cf- <dig> while the cf- <dig> was also independently acquired in the marine synechococcus sp. wh <dig> from heterocystous cyanobacteria, as supported by domain phylogeny, deviated dinucleotide signature and gc%.

the abundance of pathways putatively encoding siderophores identified in this study also favours this ecological function hypothesis. considering the low solubility of iron in aerobic environments and the iron rich photosynthetic apparatus of cyanobacteria, diverse strategies for iron chelation could play a role in bloom formation in iron-limited marine and fresh waterbodies
 <cit> .

even though modular nrps/pks megasynthases appear like an energetically expensive solution for producing small secondary metabolites, they allow the incorporation of non-protein substrates as well as facile evolution of product diversity
 <cit> . expansion of nrps/pks clusters during evolution of cyanobacteria resulted in diversification at the genetic level, as basis for the observed chemical diversity of the bioactive metabolites. previous studies on individual cyanobacterial groups have demonstrated that genomic information can enable the discovery of unanticipated biosynthetic enzymology and compound types
. therefore, the identification of shared pathways at the phylum level presented here will serve as a valuable foundation for further metabolic discoveries, particularly in the frame of mass spectral networking analysis
.

CONCLUSIONS
genomic analysis of secondary metabolism of cyanobacteria, which is the first conducted at phylum-wide level, reveals the potential of these microbes to recombine, diversify and spread modular nrps/pks gene clusters encoding a multitude of compounds. the  <dig> cluster families identified in this study are representing certain of the biosynthetic pathways of known cyanobacterial compounds, highlighted several new conserved pathways within cyanobacteria, and reveal a large number of orphan pathways with high drug discovery potential. the data also suggests that further genome sequencing of the cyanobacterial phylum will widen the nrps/pks pathway diversity. finally, genome mining leads to a better understanding of the functions of some of the secondary metabolites for the producing organisms and unveil new biosynthetic mechanisms that will become an inspiration for synthetic biology and biotechnical applications.
