BACKGROUND
the n- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acids  play an important role in cellular functioning and normal brain cognitive function development including learning and memory  <cit> . the studies have shown that low dietary n- <dig> pufa and low plasma docosahexaenoic acid  concentrations decreased n- <dig> pufa in the brain and in turn resulted in behavioral defects  <cit> . it is known that high dietary saturated fat lead to hypercholesterolemia, and high blood pressure, causing atherosclerosis  <cit> . hypertension and atherosclerosis cause dysfunction in the blood brain barrier function, and ischemia in the brain which may lead to the cognitive impairment  <cit> . on the contrary, recent studies have shown that pufa improve spatial memory  <cit> . the pufa supplementation contributes to modulation of membrane composition, fluidity and selective permeability, cellular signaling and regulation of gene expression  <cit> .

the current diets are generally deficient in n- <dig> fatty acids and abundant in n- <dig>  <cit> . the n- <dig> fatty acids increase membrane fluidity by replacing n- <dig> fatty acids and cholesterol from the membrane  <cit>  maintaining an optimal membrane fluidity which is obligatory for neurotransmitter binding and signaling within the cell  <cit> . the n- <dig> pufa incorporated into the neuron membrane also increase synaptic protein expression, strengthening the hippocampal synaptic plasticity  <cit> . this is modulated by transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors   <cit> .

the ppars play a critical physiological role as lipid sensors and regulators of lipid metabolism  <cit> . the pparα and pparγ are the key messengers responsible for the translation of nutritional stimuli into changes for the expression of genes, particularly genes involved in lipid metabolism  <cit> . fatty acids can activate and induce the enzymes of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway at the transcriptional level by the mediation of ligand-activated transcription factors ppars  <cit> . the pparα plays an important role in the regulation of acetylcholine biosynthesis that contributes to cognitive function  <cit> , and pparγ has a prominent role in the regulation of central nervous system  inflammation and neuroprotection  <cit>  leading to improvement in cognitive performance  <cit> . these findings indicated that cognitive performance can be enhanced through ppar nuclear receptors  <cit> . however, the modulation effects of different dietary n6: n- <dig> ratio on ppar genes at the hippocampal level is still not well understood. therefore, the present study aimed to examine the hypothesis that a reduction in dietary n-6: n- <dig> pufa ratios may alter the hippocampal ppar gene expression and consequently spatial memory.

RESULTS
behavioral test
spatial acquisition
on the first trial of acquisition, no difference was found in escape latency among the three groups. the relative escape latency of all groups gradually declined over the training period  . on the first day of the second trial, the lmo and hmo rats had a shorter relative escape latency compared with ctrl . on day  <dig>  the hmo rats spent the shortest time to find the platform .

probe trial
the hmo rats swam for a higher percentage of time in the target quadrant  compared with the other quadrants  . conversely, the ctrl rats relied on random probability to locate the platform and spent a similar percentage of time in all quadrants .

gene expression
the effects of different levels of menhaden fish oil and soybean oil supplementation on ppar gene expression are shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  the pparα  and pparγ  genes showed a higher level of expression in the lmo and hmo groups compared with the ctrl group . in other words, the reduction of dietary n-6: n- <dig> pufa ratios upregulated the ppar gene expression in the hippocampus.

discussion
the aim of the present study was to clarify whether the n- <dig> fatty acids could affect the expression of mrna encoding for ppars in the memory-related brain region, the hippocampus. previous studies have reported that dietary pufa were able to increase pparα and pparγ gene expression in different tissues. for instance, the expression of pparα genes in human macrophages tends to increase following incubation with n- <dig> fatty acids  <cit> . the studies have also reported that the increasing dietary pufa will upregulate pparα and pparγ expression after lipopolysaccharide -induced ppars downregulation in the spleen, liver and bursa of chickens  <cit> .

in this study, the results demonstrated that diets with low n-6: n- <dig> pufa ratios improved spatial memory and upregulated the hippocampal pparα and pparγ gene expression. this is evident in the performance of the unsupplemented ctrl group in the probe trial. the ctrl group had difficulties recalling the location of the escape platform from the most recent training session. as a result they depended on random chance to locate the platform and spent a similar percentage of time in all quadrants. the probe trial is typically used to assess reference memory in test subjects, and administered immediately after a training or acquisition session  <cit> . current results also indicated differences between the expression of pparα and pparγ genes in the rats supplemented with two different n-6: n- <dig> pufa ratios. in fact, the level of expression of these genes was increased by the reduction of n-6: n- <dig> fatty acid ratios. the pparα and pparγ are expressed widely in the cns, especially in the brain areas involved in learning and memory, such as the hippocampus  <cit> . the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic role of ppars could play important functions in the improvement of the mental ability of the brain  <cit> . other possible mechanisms underlying the links between these changes in ppars expression and the learning process may be related to their transcriptional role in synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation . the involvement of these transcription factors in protein synthesis are relevant to the synaptic mechanisms that mediate the formation of long term memory. transcription is an essential step for long term synaptic plasticity and transcription factors play an important role in ltp through molecular alterations which facilitate long term synaptic plasticity and memory formation  <cit> . indeed, participation of the transcription factor ppars in the consolidation of memory in the rat’s hippocampus results in the improved performance in the spatial memory task. the ppars have specific functions in regulating the expression of genes involved in neurotransmission, and therefore play important roles in complex processes including learning and memory formation  <cit> . they played an essential role in regulating gene encoding for neurotransmitter receptors, synaptic protein and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or release  <cit> . the n- <dig> pufa stimulate ppar target gene expression such as lipoprotein lipase , fatty acid transport protein  and acyl-coa synthase , thus enhancing the effects of n- <dig> pufa on brain function  <cit> .

in summary, the study showed that there is a relationship between gene expression of ppars and feeding with n- <dig> fatty acids. the increase in n- <dig> pufa of the brain may lead to increased ppar gene expression. it also suggests that pparα and pparγ as transcription factors may affect the expression of synaptic proteins leading to increased synaptic plasticity and improved spatial memory in animals supplemented with higher n- <dig> pufa, where the ratio of n-6: n- <dig> of  <dig> : <dig> was more effective than the ratio of 22: <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, it was shown that the n- <dig> pufa supplementation resulted in differences in pparα and pparγ expressions in the brain. in conclusion, pparα and pparγ genes displayed a tendency to be expressed at a higher level in rats fed diets with a lower n-6: n- <dig> pufa ratio and may be able to improve spatial learning and memory. further studies should be done using relatively pure n- <dig> and n- <dig> fatty acids to confirm these findings, and confirm that the lower n-6: n- <dig> ratios can improve learning and memory and increase the expression of ppars in the hippocampus. further investigations should be carried out to examine the effects of n-6: n- <dig> ratios on the gene expression in other brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and others.
