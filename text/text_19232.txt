BACKGROUND
natural rubber poly with a molecular mass of 10- <dig>  kda is one of the most important industrial raw materials in the world, and its sole commercial source is currently the para rubber tree hevea brasiliensis  <cit> . other sources, such as russian dandelion  and guayule , could be useful in the event of supply shortages as well as providing a suitable alternative for people with allergies to hevein, a major allergen present in h. brasiliensis latex  <cit> .

the biosynthesis of natural rubber takes place in the latex of laticifers or specialized parenchyma cells in the bark  <cit> , where it is stored in rubber particles as an end product. ultrastructural analysis of rubber particles from different species  <cit>  revealed an almost identical globular structure that contains a homogeneous hydrophobic rubber core surrounded by an intact monolayer membrane. the monolayer membrane includes a mixture of lipids, proteins and other molecules with the hydrophilic portions of the phospholipids and glycosylated particle-bound proteins facing the cytoplasm  <cit> . the size of rubber particles ranges from  <dig> - <dig> μm in h. brasiliensis,  <dig> - <dig>  μm in ficus species and 1- <dig> μm in p. argentatum  <cit> .

natural rubber is synthesized by adding activated 2-methyl- <dig> -butadiene  to the growing chain  <cit> . this reaction is catalyzed by specific long-chain cis-prenyltransferases , which are probably located on the surface of rubber particles. according to their function, cpts are classified as short-, medium- or long-chain polymerizing enzymes and can be distinguished from trans-prenyltransferases  by the presence of five conserved protein motifs  <cit> . they are found in bacteria  <cit> , yeast  <cit> , animals including humans  <cit>  and plants  <cit> .

recently, two cpts  were isolated from saccharomyces cerevisiae and were shown to be responsible for the biosynthesis of dolichol, a long-chain polyprenol with a saturated alpha-isoprene unit, which serves as a glycosyl carrier for protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . the first plant cpt was identified in arabidopsis thaliana , and appears to be required for normal growth and development  <cit> . the latex of h. brasiliensis contains at least two cpts, designated hrt <dig> and hrt <dig> . the addition of recombinant hrt <dig> to washed latex particles supplemented with radioactively-labeled ipp resulted in the significant production of a high-molecular-weight labeled rubber product, whereas recombinant hrt <dig> showed no significant activity  <cit> . in vitro, initiation of rubber biosynthesis by hrt requires intact particles, isopentenyl diphosphate , allylic diphosphates such as farnesyl diphosphate  and divalent metal cations  as a co-factor  <cit> . however, all attempts to purify a functional rubber transferase from rubber particles have failed, suggesting that the native enzyme needs additional factors for its activity  <cit> .

in this study, we report the comprehensive analysis of rubber particles from t. koksaghyz. the rubber particles contained very pure poly and retained their capacity to produce natural rubber ex vivo. immunological analysis revealed that cpts associated with these particles remain fully functional when expressed as recombinant proteins either in saccharomyces cerevisiae or tobacco protoplasts.

RESULTS
physical characterization of purified t. koksaghyz rubber particles
rubber particles examined by transmission electron microscopy at low magnification appeared approximately spherical, with diameters ranging from  <dig>  to almost  <dig> μm . at higher magnification, additional small and mostly spherical particles became visible with the smallest barely  <dig> nm in diameter . frequently, those rubber particles touching each other were deformed by the effect of surface tension in the staining solution during air-drying  <cit> . a similar unimodal particle size distribution ranging from  <dig> - <dig>  μm was observed by photon correlation spectroscopy, using rubber particles from the latex of 4-month-old and 1-year-old t. koksaghyz plants . the average size of the rubber particles was  <dig> nm, and more than 50% of particles were in the size range 250- <dig> nm. the age of the plants appeared not to affect particle size. size exclusion chromatography  analysis of both samples revealed an weight average molecular mass of ~  <dig>  kda with a unimodal distribution, which again showed no significant variation as a function of plant age .

concentration and chemical properties of t. koksaghyz rubber
the concentration of rubber in the latex of greenhouse-cultivated t. koksaghyz plants was monitored from 4- <dig> months after sowing, revealing an increase during the first  <dig> months after which the concentration leveled off and remained constant at 130- <dig> mg dry rubber ml- <dig> latex thereafter. although the absolute rubber concentration varies in different t. koksaghyz accessions and under different growth conditions, our results agree with earlier investigations of rubber production in field-grown t. koksaghyz plants, where rubber accumulated only during the first growth season and then remained at constant levels  <cit> . to determine the chemical properties of t. koksaghyz rubber, we performed one- and two-dimensional nmr analysis of isolated rubber particles dissolved in dichloromethane. the 13c nmr spectrum displayed five dominant signals at chemical shifts indicative for poly, but not for poly   <cit> . notably, the 13c nmr chemical shifts of c- <dig> and c- <dig> differ by more than  <dig> ppm for the cis- and trans-configured compounds . therefore, the observed frequencies leave no doubt that t. koksaghyz rubber is poly. moreover, all 1h13c and 1h1h correlations detected in two-dimensional hmqc and cosy experiments, respectively, fully agreed with the couplings expected for poly . the nmr spectra contained few low-intensity signals arising from impurities, indicating that the purity of poly in t. koksaghyz rubber is >95%.

in vitro biosynthetic activity of rubber particles
the rubber biosynthetic activity of t. koksaghyz rubber particles was characterized in vitro by assaying the incorporation of the radiolabeled precursor ipp, which should become incorporated into the polymer and thus trapped in the rubber particles  <cit> . the ipp incorporation assay was carried out using intact isolated rubber particles as well as particles pre-treated with proteinase k to destroy particle-associated enzymes and other proteins. the treated and untreated particles were tested by sds-page and coomassie brilliant blue staining, showing that the protein bands normally found in the particles were eliminated by proteinase k treatment . this control allowed us to distinguish between physical and enzymatic incorporation of ipp into the particle, but had no influence either on particle integrity or stability. earlier investigations into the in vitro activity of rubber particles used boiled particles as a control  <cit> , which was not suitable for t. koksaghyz particles because of their rapid temperature-dependent agglomeration which changes the surface area to which ipp could be attached.

in time course experiments, t. koksaghyz rubber particles enzymatically incorporated increasing amounts of ipp over the incubation time . saturation was achieved after  <dig> h, possibly reflecting the loss of chain elongation activity due to the particles becoming unstable as reported for other rubber-producing plants  <cit> . the incorporation of ipp also increased as more rubber particles were added to the reaction, giving a sigmoid curve progression that reflected an enzymatic incorporation process. the enzymatic activity of t. koksaghyz rubber particles in vitro was about  <dig>  pmol min- <dig> mg- <dig> 

to calculate the rubber transferase activity of the rubber particles, ipp incorporation was measured as a function of protein concentration , whereas the mean amount of protein in t. koksaghyz rubber particles remained approximately constant at 70- <dig> μg mg- <dig>  this allowed us to calculate the enzymatic ipp incorporation activity of  <dig> - <dig> pmol min- <dig> mg- <dig> rubber particle protein, which corresponds to the findings for rubber particles from other plants . the range of rubber particle activity observed within each species could reflect the different assay conditions and particle extraction methods. for example, rubber transferase activity is thought to be mg2+-dependent  <cit> , and the concentration of mg2+ may differ between species, whereas optimal concentrations for h. brasiliensis and p. argentatum were  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm, respectively  <cit> . we therefore varied the mg2+ concentrations in the in vitro rubber transferase assay for t. koksaghyz rubber particles, and found the optimal activity at 4- <dig> mm mg2+ . to verify that rubber chain elongation in t. koksaghyz rubber particles occurred by the transfer of ipp in the cis-configuration, a sophisticated labeling assay was developed in which rubber particles were incubated with ipp, vacuum dried and the residual material dissolved in cd2cl <dig> for 13c nmr analysis. the 13c nmr signal of c- <dig> poly  showed, in addition to the intense central signal, pairs of coupling satellites characterized by coupling constants of  <dig> hz  and  <dig> hz . the c- <dig> satellite pair was approximately three times more intense than the c- <dig> pair , indicating that isotopologues with adjacent 13c- <dig> and 13c- <dig> were slightly enriched in accordance with their biosynthetic origin from ipp . the low enrichment factor can be explained by the large excess of unlabeled poly at the beginning of the labeling reaction. nevertheless, the non-stochastic distribution of the satellite pairs provides additional evidence for cis-prenyltransferase activity under these experimental conditions.

for the ex vivo rubber biosynthesis experiment  <dig> mg of freshly prepared rubber particles was incubated for  <dig> min with ipp in ipp assay buffer containing different concentrations of mg2+ ion. values represent mean  from three biological repetitions.

the distribution of ipp transfer to existing rubber molecules of different molecular masses was investigated by sec . this revealed a typical skewed unimodal mass, with a weight average molecular mass  of  <dig>  kda  and number average molecular mass  of  <dig>  kda , indicating a low level polydispersity of  <dig> . again, the incorporation of ipp increased with the incubation time . after  <dig> min the incorporation of ipp occurred at a significantly higher rate in untreated particles compared to those treated with proteinase k, whereas the means of labeled material were  <dig>  kda for w and  <dig> kda for n, respectively. furthermore, the sec data indicated that in vitro rubber chain elongation occurred over a broad range , whereas the highest incorporation rate was observed for molecules with w of  <dig> - <dig>  kda. interestingly, the w and n of the ipp labeled rubber decreased during the assay , increasing the polydispersity  and indicating both the preferential transfer of ipp to long-chain molecules and the possibility that new rubber molecules are synthesized after the depletion of the long-chain starter molecules. the lower molecular mass distribution of labeled molecules in comparison to the starting material suggested that chain termination by transferase complex might occur preferentially in molecules > <dig>  kda. these data indicate that in vivo rubber biosynthesis can be only partially reconstituted in vitro as also suggested by tangpakdee et al.  <cit> .

in an ex vivo rubber biosynthesis experiment  <dig>  mg of freshly prepared rubber particles was incubated with ipp for the time periods indicated. extracted rubber material for each assay was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography and radioactivity levels were determined by scintillation.

particle associated cis- <dig> -polyprenylcistransferases
recently, we identified and isolated three t. koksaghyz cpts designated tkcpt1- <dig>  <cit> . the tkcpt <dig> and tkcpt <dig> cdnas are each  <dig> bp in length and the tkcpt <dig> cdna is  <dig> bp in length, giving proteins with molecular masses of 32- <dig> kda. all three genes are strongly expressed in the latex, but only minimally expressed in other tissues such as leaves, pedicels and roots. antibodies recognizing the three tkcpts revealed a strong signal in western blots of the rubber particle fraction of t. koksaghyz latex, with an apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda . although it has previously been suggested that rubber transferases are associated with rubber particles  <cit> , our results for tkcpts are the first to confirm this theory explicitly.

functional analysis of tkcpt1-3
to determine whether the three isolated cpt genes encode functional proteins with long chain cis-prenyltransferase activity in vivo, the cdnas were expressed in the yeast strain snh23-7d , which is a temperature sensitive mutant for the dehydrodolichyl diphosphate  synthase rer <dig>  <cit> . all three t. koksaghyz cpts were able to suppress the growth deficiency phenotype of the rer <dig> mutant , and western blot analysis of the complementing yeast transformants revealed the expression of full length tkcpt1- <dig> proteins . the suppression of the temperature sensitive phenotype demonstrated clearly that tkcpt1- <dig> catalyze the synthesis of the cis-polyprenol dedol-pp, which has a molecular mass of  <dig> - <dig>  kda. similar results were obtained for hrt <dig>  which is believed to be the long-chain rubber producing cpt in h. brasiliensis  <cit> . the formation of high-molecular-mass polyprenols in yeast is possibly repressed by the rapid de-phosphorylation of the dedol-pp to dolichol, which is not a substrate for the chain elongation process. it has previously been suggested that rubber transferases need co-factors for stability and activity  <cit>  but our experiments indicate that, at least for t. koksaghyz cpts under our experimental conditions, this does not appear to be the case.

more detailed analysis of tkcpt activity was carried out using n. tabacum mesophyll protoplasts transfected with each of the cdnas . in order to avoid qualitative or quantitative differences in protoplast and/or plasmid dna preparations interfering with the direct comparison of cpt activities between transfection experiments, beta-glucuronidase was co-expressed from the same plasmid as an internal standard as described by lepetit et al.  <cit> . protein extracts from protoplasts expressing each of the tkcpts showed strong ipp transferase activity, with no significant difference between the three cdnas. it is therefore most likely that all three enzymes act cooperatively in t. koksaghyz rubber biosynthesis.

protoplasts were transfected with plasmids containing both gus and tkcpts or gus alone in all cases controlled by the camv 35s promoter. protoplast protein extracts were used for measurement of enzyme activities, whereas gus activity served as the internal standard for normalization of transfection experiments. values represent mean  from six biological repetitions. no significant differences existed in enzyme activity between tkcpt <dig>  tkcpt <dig> and tkcpt <dig>  as calculated using student's t-test .

CONCLUSIONS
we have investigated the physical properties and developmental profile of rubber particles from t. koksaghyz latex and have shown that they possess intrinsic cis- <dig> -polyprenylcistransferase  activity of  <dig>  pmol min- <dig> mg- <dig> which can be partially reconstituted in vitro without further co-factors. we are the first to demonstrate conclusively that cpts are an intrinsic part of the rubber particle and we have demonstrated a correspondence between the cpt activity in isolated rubber particles and the recently identified cpt genes tkcpt1- <dig> in t. koksaghyz, which are able to complement a yeast strain deficient in cpt activity and maintain their activity in tobacco protoplasts. in vitro rubber biosynthesis experiments resulted in a skewed unimodal distribution of isopentenyl pyrophosphate  incorporation at a weight average molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. our data indicate that tkcpt1- <dig> are responsible for the rubber chain elongation that occurs in t. koksaghyz rubber particles and that their roles in this regard may be redundant. our experiments provide crucial background information that will allow the development of t. koksaghyz as a potential alternative commercial source of rubber.
