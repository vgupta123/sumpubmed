BACKGROUND
it is apparent that a quantitative understanding of microbial populations in various habitats can not be accomplished utilizing traditional culture methods  <cit>  inasmuch as “unculturable” components may greatly outnumber all others  <cit> . the term unculturable is taken  <cit>  to simply mean that current technology/methods do not permit the growth of the particular organism in vitro yet these same organisms may thrive, or at least survive, in their native habitat. obviously organisms which are moribund or injured are also likely to be unculturable. even when the organisms in question can be propagated, they are liable to be analytically under-represented using most plate counting methods  <cit> . one way to enumerate microbial populations ex colliquiā  is by means of a quantitative metagenomic analysis   <cit>  given that the metagenome includes all organisms: culturable, viable but not culturable  <cit> , as well as moribund/dead cells.

the disruption of the cell wall envelope  <cit>  is one of the most important aspects of quantitative metagenomic analysis since the total isolation of dna from all eubacteria is required. these “true bacteria” consist of cells bounded by a cytoplasmic lipid membrane and either a thick peptidoglycan, also known as murein  <cit> , layer  or a thin peptidoglycan stratum layered between an inner and outer membrane . this outer membrane contains lipopolysaccharides  which are made up of lipid a , core polysaccharides , and an o-antigen   <cit> .

there are numerous methods available for cell wall disruption including physical approaches   <cit> , biochemical-based methods   <cit>  or some combination of the two  <cit> . quantitative extraction of dna is particularly difficult for some bacteria, especially the gram-positives, which seem to be somewhat more resistant to cell wall dissolution. the “prototypal”  <cit>  cell disruption method was published in  <dig>  <cit>  and used an enzyme/detergent extraction and organic solvents to remove low molecular weight solutes whereupon recovery of the dna from an aqueous solution was made using alcohol precipitation. for chemical disruption, different compounds have been used to dissolve and/or disrupt the bacterial cell wall: enzymes such as lysozyme and proteinase k, detergents , as well as other chaotropic compounds  and chelating agents . physical techniques are often the first method of choice for cell disruption, and include mechanical disruption, liquid homogenization, sonication, freeze-thawing, and manual grinding. regardless of what protocol one uses, the dna which is extracted should be in a form that can be employed for immediate analysis  <cit> .

our research project’s long-term goal is to quantitatively assess the relative composition of culturable  <cit>  as well as all other forms of eubacteria associated with meat processing, which can have as many as  <dig> colony forming units  cm- <dig>  <cit>  of area tested. ultimately, we seek to determine if background organisms from such environments outgrow   <cit>  and mask entrapped pathogens  from detection in processed foods. upon reviewing recent literature  <cit> , it was unclear which, if any, commercial cell lysis/dna extraction kits extract genomic dna quantitatively . this latter statement is true because the subject tests were performed using a small, somewhat arbitrary, collection of techniques with little concern for statistical analyses of target dna concentration. additionally, primer-specific standards were not typically used to convert raw qpcr data to the total number of gene copies as a function of some standard cell concentration determinant such as most probable number , cfu or even microscopic cell counts. thus, there is a need to investigate not only some recent next generation genomic dna extraction procedures but also to do so using a more rigorous experimental design: i.e., true replication on the major source of microbiological variability using at least  <dig> clonal isolates derived from various food products and cfu-normalized target dna concentration .

statistical analyses
the covariance  associated with an hypothetical set of variables η <dig> l and η <dig> l  was calculated using the excel function “ =covariance.p” and the  <dig> variances, ση <dig> and ση <dig>  were calculated using “ =)^2” and “ =)^2”. identical results were obtained using the variance-covariance matrix  approach whereupon ση1⋅η <dig> is equal to the two off-diagonal terms and ση <dig> or ση <dig> are the diagonal components. the statistical relevance of ση1⋅η <dig> was calculated by testing the significance of ρη1⋅η <dig> = ση1⋅η <dig> × ση12⋅ση22− <dig>  using a t-test  at some level of probability p. determination of this probability-level was made by continuously changing  this term in the excel equation for tΡ until the tinv function matched that of tρ. such tests can be important for some comparisons since they determine the statistical significance of a correlation of paired variables which are not necessarily a direct function of one another but which might vary together  because of subtle factors in the system being examined. all x¯ values reported in figures/tables are presented ± -weighted standard deviations ”). one-way analyses of variance  operations were performed assuming a randomized complete block design  <cit>  and means were separated based upon a “tukey multiple range” analysis which is also known as the “honestly significant difference”  test  <cit> . all anova calculations and our algorithm for hsd are provided in the .

16s rdna standard solutions
one gram-positive  and two species of gram-negative  bacteria were streaked onto luria-bertani  plates and grown overnight at room temperature whereupon a single colony of each was selected. all these strains had previously been isolated from commercially available ground or whole chicken and identified based upon 16s rrna gene sequencing  <cit> . each selected colony was mixed with 50 μl prepman ultra , heated 15 min at 99°c in a thermocycler , cell debris was collected into a pellet by centrifugation , and the supernatant collected into a fresh tube. amplification of the 16s rrna gene was then performed as follows. each pcr cocktail contained 25 μl gotaq green 2× , 5 μl  each of euba and eubb  <cit>  forward and reverse primers, 14 μl pcr water , and 1 μl of the aforementioned genomic dna template. thermocycler conditions were as follows: dna denaturation at 95°c for 90 s,  <dig> total cycles consisting of denaturing at 95°c for 30 s, annealing at 55°c for 45 s, extension at 72°c for 60 s  <cit> ; as a final extension, samples were maintained at 72°c for 5 min.

upon determining the presence of the 16s rrna gene using gel electrophoresis , the pcr products were purified using ampure magnetic beads  as detailed previously  <cit> . the concentration of these various target dna standards  was determined using a nanodrop nd- <dig> uv–vis spectrophotometer  where 2 μl of undiluted, purified pcr product was placed onto the apparatus and the od measured . od <dig> values were converted to concentration  by comparing them with solutions of known dna concentration . dilutions were made on this original cleaned-up standard so that the final concentration of dna was ~  <dig> 16s rdna copies per μl . when used as a qpcr standard set of solutions  <dig> additional 1: <dig> dilutions were made .

qpcr
sheared salmon sperm dna  was used to suppress the apparent binding of standard or unknown target dna to the walls of the mixing tubes . the salmon sperm dna was diluted so that the final concentration was 4 ng per reaction. quantifast sybr green  was utilized where each polymerase chain reaction contained:  <dig>  μl 2× quantifast sybr green,  <dig>  μl of a 10 μm stock solution of each forward and reverse primers ,  <dig>  μl pcr h2o , and 1 μl template dna . all experiments were run on an applied biosystems  <dig> fast  real-time pcr and the conditions were programmed according to the quantifast sybr green protocol   <cit> . dna melt-curve  <cit>  data were always collected and checked to confirm that the appropriate pcr product was being amplified in unknown dna extractions. for testing isolates  other than the above, a set of “universal” 16s rdna primers was generated based upon minor modifications of oligonucleotides published by nadkarni et al.  <cit> : universal forward  = gtg cca gca gcc gcg gta ata c, universal reverse  = gac tac cag ggt atc taa tcc, 291 bp product. the aforementioned bt standard was used for all gram-positive and the ss standard was utilized for all gram-negative species. using either set of standards resulted in approximately the same values for j.

qpcr data analysis
derivative-based methods have been shown  <cit>  to have an advantage over the threshold cycle number  method in calculating qpcr results given that they require no baseline correction. in our usage, c∂ is the calculated cycle  number where ∂2rn/∂c2 =  <dig>  which is based upon linear extrapolation from the two ∂2rn/∂c <dig> data points bounding  <dig> and constitute the last positive and first negative data points within the ∂2rn/∂c <dig> data. we have found  that there were only small differences between the c∂ and ct method from the standpoint of either c∂ or ct as a function of log10i slopes: method 1 = ∂c∂i/∂log10i = − <dig>  ±  <dig>   and method 2 = ∂cti/∂log10i = − <dig>  ±  <dig>  . we also found that there was a highly significant covariance statistic  associated with the two methods alluded to above  indicating that the two methods’ slopes vary significantly together which is reasonable, and expected, for different calculation methods used on the same “raw” data . we prefer the c∂-based technique because it is better-defined and more objective than ct-based values which use thresholds assigned by thermocycler software . most importantly, however, we have observed consistently smaller standard deviations  using the derivative method. all target dna concentrations reported in tables are based upon the j calculation provided in “abbreviations, symbols, & equations” above.

organisms used for extraction method testing
screening all extraction methods
bt, ss and ec bacterial strains were streaked onto lb plates and incubated at 30°c until colonies were about 1 mm in size. three separate colonies  for each isolate were chosen and inoculated into  <dig> lots  each of lb broth and grown at 30°c at 200 rpm   <cit> . after 16 hrs, each isolate’s  <dig> biological replicates were chilled in an ice-bath and 6 ×  <dig> drop-plated  <cit>  on solid lb media so that all dna quantification could be eventually normalized to colony forming units . after plating, each overnight culture was broken up into numerous 1 ml aliquots, centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm , and supernatant discarded. these bacterial pellets were stored at -20°c until needed for each set of extractions. immediately before use, pellets were thawed and re-centrifuged to remove excess liquid and/or condensation.

various bacterial strains , were streaked onto lb plates and incubated at 30°c until colonies were about 1 mm in size. the preceding bacterial isolates marked with an asterisk were obtained from a local microbiological collection and  <dig> primer-based 16s rdna sequencing  <cit>  was used to substantiate their putative identity. all other isolates were obtained from a collection produced during a population  study from this group previously published  <cit> . as before,  <dig> colonies  were chosen for each isolate and inoculated into lb broth at 30°c at 200 rpm. one isolate, pseudomonas oleovorans, was also grown in tryptic soy broth/plates  due to our concern that this organism did not seem to grow as well on lb. numerous 1 ml samples from the overnight culture were selected and centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm and the supernatant was discarded. these bacterial pellets were then stored at -20°c until needed for the various extraction experiments. as previously mentioned, each of the isolates’ three cultures were also drop-plate enumerated so that all dna quantification could be normalized to cfu.

dneasy blood & tissue kit 
two hundred μl of pbs was added to each pellet and 20 μl proteinase k  were added along with 200 μl buffer al and briefly vortexed. samples were incubated at 56°c in a dry bath for 10 minutes and 200 μl of etoh was added and mixed. this suspension was transferred onto a filter column and centrifuged for 1 min at  <dig>  rpm . the collection tube was discarded and replaced, after which 500 μl buffer aw <dig> was added, centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 1 min and collection tube was again discarded. five hundred μl of aw <dig> was added to the column and centrifuged for 3 min at  <dig>  rpm . the filter column was then placed into a clean  <dig>  ml centrifuge tube and 200 μl buffer ae was pipetted onto the center of the membrane. the column was left to sit for 1 minute before centrifuging at  <dig>  rpm for 1 minute at which point the dna solution was collected. assay volume for calculations ~ 200 μl.

“labiase” enzyme 
a 10 ml solution of labiase   <cit>  was made and 300 μl was then added to each bacterial cell pellet and mixed with the pipette. samples were incubated at 37°c for 3 hours after which samples were subjected to dry bath at 99°c for 15 minutes and then spun down for 3 min at  <dig>  rpm whereupon the supernatant was collected. assay volume for calculations ~ 300 μl. these results have not been included in the tables due to extremely poor results .

genscript bacready 
one hundred μl of genscript reagent solution was added to each bacterial pellet. samples were incubated at room temperature for 4 hours. because the solutions were turbid after incubation, another 100 μl reagent was added and gently mixed by pipette and incubated overnight at 4°c. assay volume for calculations ~ 200 μl.

agencourt genfind v <dig> 
a 100 mg ml- <dig> solution of both rnasea and lysozyme were made but all other solutions used were provided. to each pellet, 400 μl of lysis buffer, 9 μl of a proteinase k solution , 1 μl of a rnasea solution, and 12 μl of a lysozyme solution were added. cells were lysed for 10 minutes at 37°c at which point 633 μl of a binding buffer containing magnetic beads  was pipetted into the samples and left to incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature. the beads were collected on a dynal mpc-s magnet for 15 min and the supernatant was discarded. the magnetic beads were washed with  <dig>  ml of wash buffer  <dig> with gentle re-suspension , collected again on the magnet, and the supernatant was discarded; repeat this wash step. subsequently, 1 ml of wash buffer  <dig> was added; this was was performed 2×. once the second wash was completed, 500 μl of pure water was added to the beads and re-suspended. a two minute incubation at room temperature followed, and beads were magnetically isolated for 5 minutes. the supernatant was then carefully transferred to a sterile  <dig>  ml centrifuge tube. assay volume for calculations ~ 500 μl.

quickextract bacterial dna kit 
to each bacterial pellet, 100 μl of quickextract bacterial dna extraction solution and 1 μl of lysozyme solution  was added and tubes were inverted for mixing. samples were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. since all the solutions had not clarified an additional incubation overnight at 4°c was performed. when these samples were tested most had poor ε-  and/or ρx⋅y <dig> -values  as well as excessive variability between replicates . however, when an ampure dna clean-up step was used on these samples, the results were far better and are reported herein . this step involved adding 72 μl of ampure magnetic beads  to 40 μl of the quickextract solution and mixing thoroughly using a pipette. magnetic separation of the bead•dna complex  was performed for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded. while on the magnet, beads were washed with 150 μl of 70% etoh for 30 seconds and the solution discarded. this wash was repeated and after discarding the supernatant, the beads were allowed to air-dry for 30– <dig> minutes at which point 40 μl of pcr water was added to re-suspend the beads. the beads were separated magnetically for 5 min and 30 μl of the solution was carefully removed. assay volume for calculations ~ 100 μl.figure  <dig>

high pure pcr template prep kit 
two hundred μl of pbs was added to the bacterial pellets and re-suspended whereupon 5 μl of lysozyme  was added and left to incubate at 37°c for 15 minutes. after incubation, 200 μl binding buffer was added along with 40 μl proteinase k  and followed with another incubation step at 70°c for 10 minutes. one hundred μl of isopropanol was added and sample was pipetted onto a filter column and spun at  <dig>  × g for 1 minute. collection tubes were discarded, replaced and 500 μl inhibitor removal buffer was added to the column and spun down at  <dig>  × g for 1 minute. the collection tube was again discarded, replaced, and 500 μl of wash buffer was added and spun down at the same rate. the wash was repeated a second time, making sure to discard the flow-through. the column was centrifuged an extra 15 seconds at high speed to ensure that the membrane was dry, then transferred to a new  <dig>  ml centrifuge tube where 200 μl of elution buffer was pipetted onto the membrane and spun down at  <dig>  × g for 1 minute to collect dna. assay volume for calculations ~ 200 μl.

“beadbug” microtube homogenizer  combined with high pure
each bacterial pellet was suspended in 1 ml of pbs and transferred to tubes containing beadbug beads  especially made for the beadbug homogenizer. cells were then mixed with the beads for 2 minutes at  <dig>  rpm and tubes were spun down for 3 min at  <dig>  rpm. the supernatant was carefully collected and dispersed into five sterile  <dig>  ml centrifuge tubes, each containing ~ 200 μl. the high pure extraction was then followed as outlined above. the dna solution from all  <dig> tubes, was then combined for future use. assay volume for calculations ~ 1000 μl.

omnilyse 
the omnilyse device  <cit>  consists of a disposable 3 ml syringe and an attachment with a mixing chamber as well as inlet/outlet ports. a small motor equipped with a “precision-cut impellor” has been installed in the mixing chamber along with the zirconia/silica beads. upon activation with the included battery, the motor drives the impellor at a rate ≥  <dig>  rpm when the chamber is filled with both sample and beads thereby generating a high shear force between beads causing disruption of cells caught within this “shear flow”. to each pellet, 500 μl of pcr water was added and the cells were re-suspended. the omnilyse syringe apparatus was assembled according to manufacturer directions and connected to the 6 v bat-pac battery provided with the kit. before use, each syringe and chamber containing the beads was washed with 500 μl pcr-grade water, consisting of a total of  <dig> washes  being performed in ~ 1 min. once this pre-wash process was complete, the syringe was moved to the bacterial suspension and a small amount was drawn up before the battery was turned on. the remainder of the sample was then carefully run through the chamber a total of 18– <dig> times within a 2 minute time frame. assay volume for calculations ~ 500 μl.

RESULTS
experimental approach
in order to perform quantitative metagenomic analyses of native, eubacterial populations, an efficient set of genomic dna extraction protocols is desired. towards this end we have tested a dozen “next generation” dna extraction procedures recommended by molecular biologist colleagues, or sampled from recent literature, using a qpcr assay which works for any “true” bacterial isolate in terms of obtaining target gene copy number per cfu. from prior experience  <cit>  working with the 16s rrna gene extracted from various organisms, we know that stnd and unk dna qpcr efficiencies can differ substantially and make target dna quantitation more error-prone than need be. to address this problem, we developed a qpcr protocol and simple algorithm  <cit>  which took into account, and corrected, such ε-variation between samples of unknown dna concentration and their associated standard solutions. in the current work, using this approach, we thrice-cultured various test organisms in a randomized complete block design  <cit> , used a drop-plate method  <cit>  to estimate the total cfu ml- <dig> for each biological replicate , numerous 1 ml sub-samples from each of the three cultures per isolate  were selected, solids  were centrifuged out, and the pellets were frozen  to preserve them for eventual testing as well as assist in breaking, or softening, the cell envelopes  <cit>  with a concomitant diminishment of cell viability  <cit> . these frozen concentrates of cells were then used for testing commercially available protocols, discussed below. for many of our test organisms, the number of copies of the 16s rrna gene per genome  is known  <cit>  or can be surmised from knowledge about genetically related types: e.g., using listeria spp. for bt  <cit> . also, normalization of all gene copy number results to cfus provides us with a relative measure of the closeness to truly quantitative extraction of genomic dna.

dna extraction results from gram-positive organisms
table  <dig> displays δ-normalized 16s rdna copy number data  for all extraction protocols performed on  <dig> biological replicates  of bt. the reported means have been sorted from lowest to highest and those with a different letter are taken to be “significantly” different at the p =  <dig>  level. for these bt extractions alone, the se   <cit>  was sizable because of the large variation  in the quantity of genomic dna being extracted from this gram-positive organism and is testimony to the difficulty in efficiently disrupting such murein-laden cell walls. the hsd multiple range test is also quite rigorous  due to the relatively large qp value which, in turn, is due to the sizeable number of comparisons . of these eleven dna extraction methods,  <dig> were statistically not much better than the extraction of dna with hot  rna-free water . from our experience such a low efficacy in dna extraction is more expected than not inasmuch as dna extraction biases, which result in low j= <dig>  can be caused by many problems such as chromosomal shearing and, if pure dna is required , loses can occur associated with purification schemes such as ampure magnetic beads . however, the observed large cfu-normalized gene copy number seen using the agencourt procedure  was not particularly surprising because bt is known to form long , linear chains of rod-shaped cells  <cit> .table  <dig>

however, the very high copy numbers observed using either the high pure  or omnilyse  techniques were unexpected. if bt is similar to its nearest relative , there should be 6× 16s rrna gene copies per genome  <cit> . thus, the omnilyse result implies  <dig> copies cfu- <dig> ÷  <dig> copies genome-1 ~  <dig> genomes cfu- <dig> which suggests a substantially larger number of cells cfu- <dig> than noted above. for some organisms this relatively large 16s rrna gene copy number could be somewhat over-estimated since cfu count on solid media is typically underestimated. for instance, we have found that the ratio of mpn  to cfu counting methods  for campylobacter spp. =  <dig>  ±  <dig>   <cit> . however, cfu mortality on solid media is problematic for organisms with only ~  <dig> or  <dig> cells cfu- <dig>  to achieve a 100% extraction efficiency  with an observation of  <dig> copies of the 16s rrna gene cfu- <dig> one could reasonably assume:  <dig> copies genome- <dig>  >  <dig> cells cfu- <dig>  no “correction” for growth losses on solid media because of the large cfu size, and 1– <dig>  or more  <cit> , genomes per cell since, during log-phase, some chromosomes can have several “replication bubbles”.

to determine if bt can have more than  <dig> cells cfu- <dig>  we developed an optical measure of cfu size based upon the principle that turbidity of a relatively dilute solution  of suspended particles is proportional to the number of particles per volume × the projected area per particle. thus, the turbidity, as measured by the optical density at ~ 600 nm , for bacterial cells of similar size and shape, is directly proportional to something related to number of particles & size of those particles. by normalizing the od of cell cultures to their cell density  one factors out the particles per volume term. upon calculating the ratio bt ÷ ss one achieves a measure of the number of bt cells cfu-1relative to the ss standard’s presumed number of cells cfu- <dig> . one such set of data are shown in figure 2b  and indicate that bt can have ~  <dig> cells cfu- <dig>  replicating this experiment  <dig> times more we observed an average bt ÷ ss = 128 ±  <dig>   for gently mixed cultures . performing the same analyses, but vortexing for 30 sec prior to making dilutions, we observed average bt ÷ ss =  <dig>  ±  <dig>   whereupon these two mixing treatments were significantly different at the p =  <dig>  level * = 6)”; log-transformed data). in a different set of comparable experiments, a similar result was obtained by diluting colonies of each organism  in lb broth until an od of  <dig> was achieved at which point, upon vortexing, they were 6 ×  <dig> drop-plated plated, grown overnight, and enumerated. under these conditions we found that the ratio of ss colony counts to bt counts  was 151 ±  <dig>  . we contend that the extreme difference  in observed δ between these two rod-shaped, and similar-sized, organisms at the same od  and can only be related to differences in cfu dimension. all these results support the concept that bt can have a large number of cells per cfu relative to ss and that the omnilyse technique of cell lysis provided close-to-quantitative genomic dna extraction from this tough-walled  <cit> , gram-positive organism. to achieve a complete agreement of the cfu-normalized od results  with the cfu-normalized 16s rdna copy data  we merely had to assume a bulk average of  <dig>  genomes per cell  <cit>  ×  <dig> gene copies per genome ×  <dig> cells cfu- <dig> figure  <dig>

dna extraction results from gram-negative organisms
tables  <dig> and  <dig> display cfu-normalized 16s rrna gene copy number data  for all extraction protocols  using ss and ec as target organisms. as with the bt extractions , these results demonstrated that the omnilyse , agencourt  and high pure  genomic dna extraction procedures were consistently the most efficient. it is interesting to note, however, that the high pure + beadbug combined ss extraction treatment displayed  <dig>  ±  <dig>  copies cfu- <dig> which is ~ 25% of the high pure alone. something similar was also observed for ec’s high pure + beadbug treatment . these possible evidences of excessive genomic dna shearing were exacerbated when the beadbug-based protocol was used on bt . the trizol  and fast id  methods were relatively effective but for only one each of the  <dig> tested organisms. it is also curious that the quickextract  procedure for the gram-negative organisms was one of the worst  but fairly efficient, albeit variable, for our gram-positive test organism . of course, without the ampure purification procedure, the quickextract qpcr behavior from all three isolates was extremely poor: e.g.,  <dig>  > εunk >  <dig> , εunk highly variable, and, for bt, c∂j was not very linear with respect to log <dig> . we believe such poor qpcr results are an indicator of enzyme perturbation  <cit>  by inhibitory substances in the extract because they were completely reversed upon ampure clean-up whereupon  <dig>  < εunk <  <dig>  as previously demonstrated in figure  <dig> . in order to observe an 100% ee associated with the  <dig>  ss 16s rdna copies cfu- <dig>  observation, one could judiciously propose:  <dig> copies genome- <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  genomes cell- <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  cells cfu- <dig> and a  <dig>  correction for growth losses on solid media . similarly, for an 100% ee associated with an average of  <dig>  ec 16s rdna copies cfu- <dig>  necessitates assuming:  <dig> copies genome- <dig>   <dig>  genomes cell- <dig>   <dig>  cells cfu- <dig> and a  <dig>  correction  for growth losses on solid media. these plating efficiency correction terms seem unreasonably high  so it is probable that the number of genomes cell- <dig> should be made higher . backing up the larger genomes cell- <dig> value is the fact that actively dividing bacteria can contain  <dig> or more copies of complete, or partially-replicated, chromosomes per cell  <cit> . of course, the greatest unknown variables in these calculations is plating efficiency-related correction factor for cfu losses on solid media and the number of genomes per cell. since the above ee calculations seem reasonable and, in fact, vary toward the high end, it is probable that the consistently best extraction procedures  are very efficient relative to standard genomic dna protocols .table  <dig>

because the cfu-normalized dna yields for bt were often more than 50-fold greater than the equivalent for either ss or ec, normal analysis of covariance is unreasonable. alternatively, however, when the extraction methods for bt were assigned a numerical value from 1 = fast id to 11 = omnilyse  and used with either ss’s  or ec’s  cfu-normalized dna yields, one can test the level of correlation between these organisms’ dna yield covariation with the bt-based method’s order. neither ss-  nor ec-based 16s rdna yields  associated with the bt-based numerical treatments gave a “significant” correlation. a similar correlation can be made with the ss-based method order  and correlated with ec dna yields  indicating that there is a greater correlation, but still not statistically significant, between these two gram-negative species from the standpoint of dna yields. in other words, the various extraction protocols do not correlate well between species in terms of total genomic dna yield.

dna extraction results from additional gram-negative organisms
tables  <dig> and  <dig> exhibit cfu-normalized 16s rrna gene copy number data  for the  <dig> reliably best extraction protocols from tables 1– <dig> using various gram-negative eubacteria as target organisms. table  <dig> provides information on the efficiency of genomic dna extraction from aeromonas salmonicida, acinetobacter lwoffii, citrobacter freundii, hafnia alvei, and kluyvera ascorbata. using these  <dig> organisms, omnilyse was the clear statistical winner especially with respect to a. lwoffii  and c. freundii . genomic dna extracted from both k. ascorbata  and h. alvei  were also statistically better  using the omnilyse method. a. salmonicida showed a statistically equivalent extractability of all  <dig> test methods . of the  <dig> organisms in table  <dig>  we only know the number of 16s rdna copies  per genome for a. lwoffii which therefore implies at least an average of  <dig> cells cfu- <dig>  an internet search for this organism does provide some photomicrographs; one example showed the number of cells cfu- <dig> ranging from  <dig> or  <dig> to over 40: x¯ ± s =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ; however, some of the cell clustering in photomicrographs is probably due to artifacts associated with sample preparation. table  <dig> provides data on the relative efficiency of genomic dna extraction from pantoea agglomerans, pseudomonas oleovorans, rahnella aquatilis, salmonella typhi, and serratia proteamaculans. of these  <dig> organisms, omnilyse was the statistical front-runner only with respect to r. aquatilis . omnilyse was statistically equivalent to the best of the other methods with p. agglomerans, p. oleovorans, and s. typhi. of all the organisms tested, only s. proteamaculans showed a relatively poor apparent extraction efficiency with the omnilyse procedure : assuming  <dig> copies genome- <dig>  <cit>  ×  <dig> genome cell-1 ×  <dig> cell cfu-1 ~  <dig> copies of the 16s rrna gene cfu- <dig>  the omnilyse technique was only ~ 17-23% efficient and the agencourt procedure is about 83% efficient. using the same assumptions for s. typhi  we estimate > 80% ee for agencourt and ~ 60% for omnilyse. it is interesting, therefore, that the gram-positive isolates give what appears to be near-quantitative genomic dna isolation using omnilyse but this was not the case for all of the gram-negative eubacteria. because of this latter observation, we hypothesize that some genomic dna shearing may be occurring for some isolates when using the omnilyse procedure.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we have evaluated a dozen commercial bacterial genomic dna extraction methodologies using  <dig> biological replicates each of bt , ss , and ec . we utilized real time qpcr quantitation and two specific sets of primers  associated with 16s rrna gene to determine the number of copies per cfu by comparing the  <dig> dilutions of unknown target dna extracts using qpcr in conjunction with  <dig> dilutions of standards for each primer set. dilutions of the unknown extract were made in order to determine if any polymerase chain reaction inhibition was apparent since this would result in an evident non-linear relationship between c∂j and log <dig> and poor εunk values . we observed such an inhibition in only two extraction procedures . the quickextract inhibition was overcome  by purifying the extracted genomic dna using ampure magnetic beads with only minor loss of dna. based upon statistical analyses of all our results, we determined that the agencourt genfind v <dig> , high pure pcr template prep kit , and omnilyse  methods provided the greatest consistent yield of genomic dna . assuming 6-7× 16s rrna gene copies per genome, between  <dig> and  <dig> genomes per cell  and  <dig> -  <dig>  or 1– <dig> cells cfu- <dig>  and a correction for the diminution of cfu survival on solid media, we project that the quantitative extraction of genomic dna from these isolates should produce ~  <dig>  16s rdna copies cfu- <dig> for bt and  <dig> to  <dig> copies cfu- <dig> for either ss or ec. the large number of cells cfu- <dig> implied by the bt-omnilyse results were supported by cfu-normalized od data . taking this into account, the omnilyse procedure appeared to provide near-quantitative extraction of genomic dna for many of these isolates. these three consistently best-performing methods  were assessed  using  <dig> additional gram-positive isolates and  <dig> gram-negative species using a set “universal” 16s rdna primers. the best overall method was found to be omnilyse inasmuch as 72% of the isolates tested gave the greatest recovery with this procedure. for 17% of these isolates, omnilyse was statistically equivalent to the best method  for these particular organisms. in 20% of the isolates tested , the omnilyse extraction procedure provided less genomic dna than  the best method. however, one of the gram-negative isolates  showed the omnilyse method was not as efficient as the other methods which might argue that this technique is damaging the dna in some species.
