BACKGROUND
members of the chlamydiaceae family grow inside host cells, when infectious elementary bodies  differentiate into replicative reticulate bodies . worldwide, chlamydia trachomatis serovars a-c are responsible for millions of cases of conjunctivitis and trachoma  <cit> . genital infections by c. trachomatis serovars d-k cause the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease  <cit> . c. trachomatis lymphogranuloma venereum serovars l1-l <dig> are invasive strains that can disseminate to lymph nodes and cause chronic inflammation. chlamydia pneumoniae causes 10% of pneumonia cases each year, and most adults are seropositive for c. pneumoniae antigens  <cit> . despite differences in tissue tropism and virulence, these chlamydiae share a significant portion of their genomes, including about  <dig> coding dna sequences   <cit> .

the chlamydiaceae diverged from a non-pathogenic ancestor about  <dig> mya  <cit> . intracellular bacterial pathogens such as rickettsia and chlamydia have undergone reductive evolution, as reduced purifying selection and a cascading loss of dna repair genes led to gene inactivation and genome contraction  <cit> . while rickettsial genomes have a high number of split genes, a high proportion of noncoding dna, and a low g+c nucleotide composition   <cit> , chlamydial genomes have few recognized pseudogenes, high coding densities  and moderate g+c nucleotide compositions   <cit> . despite the dramatic effects of gene loss, it has been difficult to determine the mode of reductive evolution from the snapshots provided by modern genome sequences. the chlamydial genomes are only half as large as the parachlamydia sp. uwe <dig> genome, so both gene acquisition and gene loss have distinguished these lineages  <cit> .

a comparison between genome sequences from c. trachomatis serovars a and d identified only  <dig> significant deletions in either strain, producing eight pseudogenes  in serovar a  <cit> . another comparison between genome sequences from l <dig> and serovar a/d strains of c. trachomatis identified  <dig> pseudogenes in l <dig> strains  <cit> . due to the relatively low number of chlamydial pseudogenes  and the conservation of chlamydial genome size , these bacteria are believed to have undergone reductive evolution, arriving at a stable genome structure. however, this model discounts gene transfer to the chlamydiales, positive selection for antigenic proteins, and thousands of nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions that have occurred among the strains  <cit> . single nucleotide polymorphisms account for much of the diversity among c. trachomatis serovars  <cit> . deciphering the differences in their genetic content will provide important clues to understand tissue tropism and subsequent disease.

most inactivated, or nonfunctionalized pseudogenes are recognized in genome sequences by the presence of nonsense mutations or indels that substantially truncate cds compared with homologous sequences. however, these mutations occur less frequently than missense mutations, which can have either minimal or catastrophic effects on protein folding and function  <cit> . inactivating substitutions are particularly difficult to identify, since these genes can still be transcribed : it is challenging to predict and prove their lack of activity  <cit> . even some genes with gross mutations can still be transcribed, leading to a broader definition of pseudogenes that may include many unrecognized elements  <cit> . in this article, we describe the independent inactivation of two arginine decarboxylase orthologs from chlamydia trachomatis strains, showing that gene loss continues in these pathogens, and illustrating the challenges of identifying recently nonfunctionalized genes.

we previously identified three genes from c. pneumoniae that comprise an arginine:agmatine exchange system . the aaxa gene encodes an outer-membrane porin protein that stimulates the activity of this system  <cit> . the aaxb gene encodes an arginine decarboxylase proenzyme that self-cleaves at ser <dig> to produce a small β-subunit and a larger α-subunit with a pyruvoyl cofactor that is essential for catalytic activity  <cit> . finally, the aaxc gene encodes a cytoplasmic-membrane arginine:agmatine antiporter  <cit> . together, these proteins catalyze the import of l-arginine, the decarboxylation of arginine to produce agmatine, and the export of agmatine from the cell. all chlamydial genome sequences contain orthologs of the aaxabc genes, which were apparently acquired by the chlamydial ancestor through horizontal gene transfer. both the c. pneumoniae and c. trachomatis strains require exogenous arginine for growth, and their genomes lack arginine biosynthesis genes  <cit> . chlamydial genomes contain artj and glnpq genes encoding a putative abc-type arginine transporter, which is controlled by the argr transcriptional regulator in some species  <cit> . therefore the aax system is probably not used to acquire proteinogenic amino acids. instead, this system could have several possible functions: it could raise the intracellular ph to resist acidification, produce agmatine – inhibiting host cell polyamine biosynthesis, or inhibit nitric oxide synthesis by host cells  <cit> .

global microarray analysis indicated that c. pneumoniae aax genes are transcribed late in the developmental cycle  <cit> . similarly, c. trachomatis serovar l2/ <dig> cells transcribe the aaxa and aaxb genes beginning  <dig> hours post infection, shortly before rbs begin to differentiate into ebs  <cit> . the aaxa protein is incorporated in the outer membrane in ebs from l2/ <dig> cells  <cit> . transcriptional profiles from c. trachomatis d/uw- <dig> cells also identified the highest levels of aaxb and aaxc transcripts at 16– <dig> hours post infection  <cit> . in this report, we confirm the late expression of the aaxa, aaxb and aaxc genes in l2/ <dig> cells and demonstrate that the three genes are co-transcribed, using rt-pcr. however, the c. trachomatis l2/ <dig> aaxb gene contains an ochre terminator in place of the tryptophan codon  <dig> found in other chlamydial orthologs   <cit> . the resulting l2/ <dig> protein is predicted to be truncated at amino acid  <dig>  compared to the full  <dig> amino acids found in the homologous proteins. in contrast, the d/uw- <dig> aaxb gene is predicted to express a full-length protein that differs in only three positions from the l2/ <dig> homolog.

to determine whether the c. trachomatis l2/ <dig> and d/uw- <dig> strains encode functional aaxb arginine decarboxylases, we cloned both aaxb genes in e. coli and determined heterologous expression using immunoblotting and activity assays. neither gene produced a functional arginine decarboxylase in e. coli; however, site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that aaxb from l2/ <dig> could be rescued by an x128w replacement, and aaxb from d/uw- <dig> could be rescued by an r115g replacement. multiple frameshift mutations in aaxc genes from c. trachomatis a/har- <dig> and b/jali are predicted to inactivate those genes  <cit> . e. coli cells expressing aaxc demonstrated arginine uptake activity of the d/uw- <dig> aaxc, but not the l2/ <dig> aaxc proteins. therefore the aax system appears to be undergoing inactivation in parallel among the c. trachomatis strains. transcription of these nonfunctional genes suggests that bioinformatic analysis underestimates the number of inactive genes in organisms undergoing reductive evolution. neither a comparison of dn/ds values nor amino acid substitution analysis was sufficiently sensitive or specific to detect recent gene inactivation by missense mutations.

RESULTS
expression of the aax genes in c. trachomatis l2/434
cdnas were prepared from chlamydial cells harvested  <dig> h post-infection. pcr amplification of intergenic regions showed that the aaxa and aaxb genes were transcribed on the same mrna, as were the aaxb and aaxc genes . no amplified product was detected for the region upstream of aaxa or downstream of aaxc, suggesting that these three genes are coordinately transcribed in a single operon. a canonical shine-dalgarno sequence  preceded each putative initiator codon. the aaxabc gene cluster is conserved in all chlamydia spp. genome sequences, and this operon is predicted to coordinately express all three genes from a polycistronic mrna.

to determine the time course of aaxabc expression, cdnas were prepared from rna isolated  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h post-infection. as a control, cdnas also were prepared from rna isolated from a mock infection, containing only host cells. amplification of an intragenic region of the constitutively expressed hsp <dig> gene confirmed the specificity and sensitivity of the analysis . amplification of intragenic regions of the aaxa, aaxb, or aaxc cdnas showed significant levels of expression  <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection, but failed to detect expression during the early stage at  <dig> h . therefore, all three genes of the aax system are preferentially transcribed at the mid- or late-stages of infection, when ebs begin to form. these results are consistent with expression profiles reported from microarray studies of global gene expression  <cit> . although the semi-quantitative transcript analysis shown in figure 2d indicates that levels of aaxc expression are the same or lower than aaxa levels, we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple, unidentified promoters in this gene cluster.

heterologous expression of aaxb from l <dig> and d strains
to test whether the l2/ <dig> ctl <dig>  gene encodes an active, truncated aaxb protein or is a true pseudogene, the ctl <dig> and ctl <dig>  genes were cloned in a multi-copy plasmid vector. an e. coli strain missing the native adiayc arginine uptake and decarboxylase genes was used to express aaxb fused to amino-terminal t7-epitope and hexahistidine tags, and untagged aaxc. immunoblotting found no epitope-tagged protein in lysates of this strain , and no arginine decarboxylase activity was detected in cell-free extracts. therefore the l2/ <dig> aaxb homolog acts as a pseudogene in e. coli. no candidate for a suppressor trna was reported in the l2/ <dig> genome sequence  <cit>  or identified using the trnascan-se program   <cit> .

for comparison, the ct <dig>  and ct <dig>  genes from c. trachomatis d/uw- <dig> were expressed from the same vector, producing t7-tagged aaxb protein in cell lysates . however, this pyruvoyl-dependent arginine decarboxylase must be cleaved to produce active enzyme, and no epitope-tagged cleavage product was detected by immunoblotting. presumably due to the lack of self-cleavage, no arginine decarboxylase activity was detected in these cell-free extracts either. in contrast, the c. pneumoniae aaxb protein was significantly activated in e. coli  <cit> .

restoration of aaxb activity by site-directed mutagenesis
the c. trachomatis aaxb protein sequences share 89% amino acid identity and 97% similarity with the active c. pneumoniae ortholog . therefore site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace the ochre codon at position  <dig> of the l2/ <dig> aaxb pseudogene with a tryptophan codon that is found in the c. pneumoniae and other c. trachomatis homologs. this x128w variant protein was expressed at high levels in e. coli extract, and the affinity-purified protein contained epitope-tagged β-subunit . this purified protein contained a mixture of proenzyme and 41% cleaved protein forming α- and β-subunits , compared to 57% cleaved protein from c. pneumoniae. the purified x128w variant protein catalyzed the decarboxylation of l-arginine with a ph optimum near  <dig> , as observed for the c. pneumoniae aaxb  <cit> . accounting for only the cleaved portion of protein, this x128w variant had a km of  <dig>  mm and a kcat of  <dig>  s- <dig>  compared to a km of  <dig>  mm and a turnover of  <dig>  s- <dig> for c. pneumoniae aaxb.

affinity-purified aaxb from d/uw- <dig> contained only proenzyme , yet this protein differs from the active x128w l2/ <dig> protein in only two amino acid positions . the val155ile substitution is conservative, and probably reflects the ancestral state. however, a gly115arg substitution occurred after the divergence of the c. trachomatis l <dig> and a-d serovars. in the structure of the homologous arginine decarboxylase from methanocaldococcus jannaschii  <cit> , the corresponding ile <dig> residue is found near the n-terminal end of β-strand  <dig> in the α-subunit. this strand forms the edge of one sheet in the αββα sandwich fold, and provides the glu <dig> carboxylate group that facilitates cleavage in this protein family  <cit> . the gly115arg replacement in c. trachomatis aaxb could alter the conformation of this β-strand, inhibiting cleavage. to test the significance of this substitution, site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct an arg115gly variant of the d/uw- <dig> protein. the affinity-purified protein was 61% cleaved, and it catalyzed l-arginine decarboxylation with a rate of  <dig>  s- <dig> .

arginine uptake activity of aaxc transporters
e. coli adiayc mutants that express the c. pneumoniae aaxc gene can exchange l--arginine for cytoplasmic arginine  <cit> . to test the function of c. trachomatis aaxc proteins, arginine uptake assays were performed using e. coli cells expressing the aaxbc genes from l2/ <dig> and d/uw- <dig> strains . no significant arginine uptake was detected in cells expressing l2/ <dig> wild-type or x128w aaxbc genes. however, cells expressing d/uw- <dig> strain aaxbc genes showed significantly enhanced uptake. although the l2/ <dig> and d/uw- <dig> aaxc proteins are 99% identical, the  <dig> amino acid substitutions appear to have reduced the l2/ <dig> protein's transport activity. these substitutions are scattered across the protein sequence, and none occurs at a conserved site in an alignment of homologs.

evolution of aaxabc genes in the chlamydiales
most mutations predicted to convert protein-coding genes to pseudogenes are nonsense or frameshift mutations that prevent translation of full-length protein. however, the frequency of missense mutations may be much higher -these proteins can still be expressed, and they may fold correctly, yet they can be functionally impaired  <cit> . several strategies have been developed to identify detrimental missense mutations, using either protein structure models or comparative sequence analysis to predict the effects of amino acid substitutions  <cit> . these models show great promise in predicting the effects of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in well-characterized human genes  <cit> . when the predicted ancestral c. trachomatis aaxb sequence  was submitted to the sorting intolerant from tolerant  web server , the g115r replacement was "predicted to affect protein function"  <cit> . however, when the c. pneumoniae aaxb sequence was submitted to the sift web server with a list of  <dig> observed replacements in the c. trachomatis sequence, all of the changes were predicted to be "tolerated." the g115r replacement alone also was predicted to be tolerated in the c. pneumoniae aaxb sequence. the pmut server  predicted  <dig> of the  <dig> replacements  to be "pathological" for the c. pneumoniae sequence  <cit> . therefore these amino acid substitution prediction tools are neither sensitive nor specific enough to predict functional changes due to missense mutations in significantly diverged bacterial sequences.

since we could not recognize specific missense mutations that impair function, we considered whether aberrant phylogenies or high rates of nonsynonymous substitution correspond to loss of function. phylogenies of the aaxabc genes have the same topologies as the 16s ribosomal rna tree   <cit> . the intact aaxabc genes from chlamydia psittaci 6bc are highly similar to their c. abortus homologs, containing several conservative amino acid replacements . these results are consistent with previous protein-sequence based phylogenies that indicated the three genes were acquired by the chlamydiaceae ancestor through horizontal gene transfer after its divergence from the parachlamydiaceae  <cit> . to measure the effects of purifying selection on these genes, dn/ds values were calculated for each branch. genes subject to negative selection often have low dn/ds values due to the costs of nonsynonymous substitutions, while genes under relaxed selection can have dn/ds values approaching 1; genes under positive selection for diversification occasionally have dn/ds values greater than  <dig>  <cit> . in a canonical model for gene loss and decay in intracellular bacteria, inactivating mutations that are fixed in a population give rise to pseudogenes that evolve neutrally, with a high frequency of deletions, increased dn/ds values and biased gc to at mutations  <cit> .

for branches in the aaxa gene tree, ds values ranged from <  <dig>   to  <dig> . dn/ds values range from  <dig>  to more than  <dig>  with the majority of lineages showing purifying selection . the highly diverged amino-terminal secretory signal sequence in c. trachomatis homologs accounted for most of the nonsynonymous substitutions. otherwise, the dn/ds values for aaxa homologs are consistent with those of the major outer membrane protein  porin. the dn/ds value was  <dig>  for the c. trachomatis d/uw- <dig> and c. pneumoniae momp pair, and  <dig>  for the c. trachomatis d/uw- <dig> and l2/ <dig> momp sequences. from these data we infer that aaxa orthologs have been subjected to moderate purifying selection, punctuated by a dramatic change in the secretory signal region of the ancestral c. trachomatis and c. muridarum gene. signal sequences can vary significantly among homologous proteins  <cit> , so further experiments will be required to test whether these changes in the signal sequence alter protein localization or expression levels. a future site-based comparison of codon substitution rates could identify specific positions subject to relaxed selection, but will require many more aaxa sequences.

despite the inactivating nonsense and missense mutations in c. trachomatis aaxb genes, the ds values for aaxb genes ranged from <  <dig>  in the c. trachomatis lineage to  <dig> separating the chlamydia and chlamydophila strains. there are correspondingly few nonsynonymous substitutions, so dn/ds values are uniformly low . the frequency of gc versus at nucleotides was not substantially different at any codon position in the inactivated genes. as observed for several rickettsial pseudogenes, gene inactivation does not always correspond to higher dn/ds values  <cit> . the aaxc gene also shows no sign of relaxed selection, even in the c. trachomatis lineages with saturating synonymous substitution rates. although homologs in c. trachomatis b/jali and a/har- <dig> strains have  <dig> or  <dig> deletions, respectively, there are no other nucleotide substitutions compared to the d/uw- <dig> strain. neutral evolution may be difficult to detect following such recent gene inactivation.

parallel loss of aax activity in c. trachomatis strains correlates with modes of infection
while the aax system from c. pneumoniae functions in e. coli, we have demonstrated that several homologous c. trachomatis genes have experienced inactivating mutations. the pathogenic chlamydiales form two distinct phylogenetic groups: the chlamydophila and chlamydia genera  <cit> . the latter includes c. trachomatis and chlamydia muridarum, a strain that causes mouse pneumonitis. an alignment of aaxb sequences shows that the c. muridarum homolog contains none of the deleterious mutations found in c. trachomatis genes, so it should form an active arginine decarboxylase . furthermore, a peptide from the aaxc transporter of this strain was identified bound to mhc class i molecules from infected murine dendritic cells  <cit> . these data indicate the chlamydial ancestor had a functional aax system, but independent mutations in the c. trachomatis homologs are progressively inactivating these genes. recent demonstrations of gene transfer and recombination among chlamydiae temper the correlation between serotype and aax functionality  <cit> . future sequences from clinical isolates and additional chlamydial species will help define the distribution and evolution of the aax system.

in early stage acute respiratory infections, c. pneumoniae ebs infect granulocytes and alveolar macrophages, which both use arginine to produce nitric oxide  <cit> . therefore the aax system may be selected for its ability to reduce l-arginine levels and nitric oxide synthase activity during infection. c. pneumoniae, unlike c. trachomatis, can infect and replicate in neutrophil granulocytes  <cit> . c. trachomatis strains rarely cause pneumonia, except in infants, who have immature alveolar macrophages  <cit> . instead, c. trachomatis strains primarily infect mucosal epithelial cells, which do not express the inducible nitric oxide synthase; however, disseminating c. trachomatis l <dig> cells can persist in unactivated macrophages  <cit> . consistent with this model, mice deficient in inducible nitric oxide synthase resolved genital c. trachomatis infections as well as normal mice  <cit> .

a similar relationship between chlamydial strain-specific metabolism and tissue tropism has been described for tryptophan biosynthesis. when ifn-γ is produced by the host during infection, it causes the expression of indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase , which degrades l-tryptophan. genital tract isolates of c. trachomatis serovars b, d-k and l <dig> produce tryptophan synthase to make tryptophan from exogenous indole. in contrast, ocular c. trachomatis serovars a, ba and c contain a deletion mutation in the trpa gene  <cit> . despite the inactivating deletion in trpa, both the trpab genes are transcribed and translated in a serovar a strain  <cit> . it has been proposed that ocular c. trachomatis strains do not encounter indole or ifn-γ induced ido during infection  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the loss of arginine decarboxylase activity in the aaxb protein from l2/ <dig> was predicted due to a nonsense mutation, but the inactivation of d/uw- <dig> aaxb was not obvious from the protein sequence. nor could we predict that the l2/ <dig> aaxc would be inactive, while the d/uw- <dig> aaxc would be active . both aaxbc orthologs are transcribed. therefore the aax system has been inactivated via independent mechanisms in at least two lineages of c. trachomatis. proteomic evidence suggests that the aaxa outer membrane protein is produced by l2/ <dig> cells during infection, but this porin could have additional functions that are independent of aax system. these results suggest a cautious interpretation of gene expression data for species undergoing reductive evolution. neither sequence comparison nor transcriptional analysis is sufficient to detect all pseudogenes in these bacteria. furthermore, recently inactivated genes may not show the hallmarks of relaxed selection, leading to over prediction of bacterial metabolic capabilities. folded into the protein sequence databases, these inactive sequences may corrupt future genome annotations and protein-structure function analyses that rely on comparative sequence analysis.
