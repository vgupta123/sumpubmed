BACKGROUND
switchgrass  is a c <dig> perennial grass native to the prairies of north america and being developed as a herbaceous crop for the biofuel feedstock production in the usa and europe  <cit> . recurrent selection procedures have been widely employed in genetic improvement of populations and development of cultivars in switchgrass  <cit> . because of its wind facilitated pollination behavior and low fertility of bagged inflorescences, switchgrass is considered to be allogamous. although homozygous inbred lines of switchgrass had not been reported yet, some studies indicated that the rate of self-pollination ranged from less than 1% of bagged inflorescences  <cit>  to higher than 50% in some specific individuals  <cit>  or a genotype grown in a controlled environment  <cit> . through continuous selfing, development of inbred lines is potentially possible, which will produce single cross hybrid cultivars in switchgrass  <cit> . hybrid vigor  has been reported in switchgrass  <cit> . using tissue culture protocols to clonally propagate two heterozygous parents for hybrid seed production was suggested  <cit> . but the approach for producing hybrid cultivars is not applied due to high costs associated with producing large quantities of switchgrass clones through tissue culture and transplanting the clones into field plantings for large scale seed production. identification of selfed progeny, offers the potential for the development of switchgrass inbred lines to serve as parents of f <dig> hybrids. the proposed procedure has proven successful for large amounts of seed production in maize , likely applicable in switchgrass.

the attempt to obtain switchgrass selfed seeds was carried out by bagging inflorescences of selected plants  <cit> . however, bagging may not be fully effective to prevent pollen contamination  <cit> . it has been proposed that seeds from bagged panicles needed to be genotyped with molecular markers to confirm parentage  <cit> . morphological traits, such as pubescence on the adaxial surface of the leaf blade, foliage color, and seed size, were used to identify selfed and crossed progeny in previous experiments  <cit> . although these phenotypic markers are simple and easily used, they are not only genotype-dependent but also may be environmentally sensitive. instead, simple sequence repeat  markers have many advantages due to their co-dominance, low cost, high polymorphism, and environmental independence, and have been available in switchgrass  <cit> . ssr markers were used for genetic diversity  <cit> , cultivar classification  <cit> , and evolution  <cit>  in switchgrass. using pcr amplifications of six individual ssr markers, one preliminary study reported the confirmation of selfed progeny in switchgrass  <cit> . it will save 50% time and cost in the lab work if a duplex pcr protocol is developed. in addition, one prerequisite for molecular genetic-based inbred testing requires non-tightly linked markers  <cit> . recently available ssr linkage maps  <cit>  enable to select molecular markers covering much of the genome and less of linkage in switchgrass.

multiplex polymerase chain reaction  consists of two or more primer sets within a single pcr mixture to produce amplicons of varying sizes that are specific to different dna sequences. since the use to detect deletions in a dystrophin gene  <cit> , multiplex pcr protocols have been well established as a widespread technique in forensic studies, disease diagnosis, pathogen identification or linkage analysis due to obvious advantages of reducing labor, time, and reagent cost . in crops, to identify genotypes, test seed purity, and protect intellectual property, multiplex pcrs have been developed in rapeseed   <cit> , cassava   <cit> , peanut   <cit> , sorghum sorghum bicolor <cit> , cotton   <cit> , soybean   <cit> , maize   <cit> , sunflower   <cit> , wheat   <cit> , and red cover   <cit> .

because of inherent variation for selfing rates in switchgrass, development of a technically reliable and easily used multiplex marker system is very useful to quantify and characterize selfing and crossing rates of switchgrass. however, no similar study has been reported in switchgrass. the objectives of this study were:  to select a set of polymorphic ssr markers based on genome-wide screening,  to develop a duplex pcr-based protocol, and  to apply this ssr system in the identification of self- and cross-fertilized progeny of selected switchgrass plants in different growth conditions.

RESULTS
screening and evaluation of genome-wide mapped ssr markers
of the  <dig> primer pairs  that were positioned on the published linkage maps  <cit> ,  <dig>  produced clearly scorable bands with approximate sizes as reported previously  <cit> . the remaining  <dig>  pps produced either no amplicons or nonspecific or smear products. the number of alleles among the scorable ssr markers ranged from one to  <dig>  the mean number of alleles per locus was  <dig>  for dinucleotide,  <dig>  for trinucleotide, and  <dig>  for other ssr markers with repeat motifs ≥ <dig> . the ssrs with dinucleotide repeats produced a significantly greater number of alleles than those with trinucleotide repeats .

from the  <dig> pps,  <dig> well amplified ssr markers were selected due to their relatively high allele number  per locus. these markers were distributed on  <dig> linkage groups  and spanned  <dig>  cm  of the reference map  <cit> . the number of ssr markers in each lg ranged from  <dig> on lg 7b to  <dig> on lg 3b . average marker interval was  <dig>  cm. the uncovered regions spanned  <dig>  cm on the recent map, and those longer than  <dig> cm were on seven lgs, i.e., lg 1b, 3a, 3b, 6a, 2a, 7a, and 9a . to estimate polymorphic information content , assess genotyping quality, and identify candidate ssr markers for multiple duplex pcr, the  <dig> ssr markers were tested for polymorphisms on  <dig> individuals selected from four different tetraploid cultivars . the raw data  for each ssr marker are presented in additional file  <dig> 

the selected est-ssr  markers produced fewer bands  than genomic ssr  . the mean number of alleles was  <dig>  amplified for essrs while  <dig>  for gssrs. mean pic value for all  <dig> loci was  <dig>  with a range from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . no significant differences in expected heterozygosity were observed among  <dig> lgs . the gssrs had a significantly higher mean pic value  than that of essr  .

development of a set of duplex pcr markers
multiplex pcrs were developed by using the principles described by edwards and gibbs  <cit>  and hayden et al. <cit> . pcr robustness, polymorphism and map position were used as the screening criteria to select  <dig> out of the  <dig> single-locus markers, and then these markers were empirically tested for duplex pcr quality. comparing to monoplex pcr conditions, which generally didn’t work in duplex pcr by just combining two sets of primers together , several adjustments associated with reaction chemicals were tested to optimize the protocol. the increase of dntp, template dna, buffer, ir-m <dig> dye, and primer concentrations did not significantly improve the amplification quality . in contrast, the increase of taq polymerase concentration from  <dig>  to  <dig>  units per 10μl reaction partially increased amplicon quantity but did not correct uneven amplification or pull up unamplified alleles . the most effective change that affected ssr primer compatibility was the increase in mg2+ concentration , which generally pulled up faintly amplified and unamplified loci .

after an optimal duplex pcr protocol was identified, individual ssr primer chemical regent quantities were modified as necessary to obtain appropriate fluorescent signals for two ssr markers in each duplex . the process of calibrating primer quantities was done by comparing fluorescent signal intensity. the relative ratio between two ssr pps’ concentrations was more important than the absolute quantities, which is consistent with previous results  <cit> . the duplex pcr protocol required adding  <dig>  to  <dig> pmoles of each ssr primer in a  <dig> μl reaction volume .

of the  <dig> tested pps,  <dig> ssr markers were assembled into  <dig> duplexes  by testing them on eight individual dna samples . twelve markers were discarded due to unsatisfactory amplifications in duplex pcrs. all duplex pcrs produced the same ssr alleles as monoplex pcrs . the  <dig> ssr markers represented  <dig> perfect and five compound repeat ssrs of dinucleotide,  <dig> perfect and one compound repeat ssrs of trinucleotide, and one compound repeat ssr of pentanucleotide . the mean pic for dinucleotide and trinucleotide ssrs were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . eleven markers were essrs and the other  <dig> gssrs .

the  <dig> markers constituting the  <dig> duplexes are distributed on  <dig> lgs and the number of ssr markers per lg ranged from one  to five , based on a published linkage map  <cit>  . the mean distance of two immediate neighboring markers was  <dig>  cm, and the nearest markers were on lg 2b with a mean distance of  <dig>  cm. the only lg with no ssr marker loci contributing to the duplex pcr sets was lg 7b, one of the shortest and least polymorphic lgs in the mapping population  <cit> .

the allele band size range of the  <dig> ssr markers was from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp  . non-allelic but targeted bands within each duplex were separated by more than10-bp among the  <dig> genotypes, aside from a 3-bp gap between alleles amplified by one duplex set  <dig> , a 5-bp gap by set  <dig>  and a 6-bp gap by set  <dig>  .

the minimum, mean and maximum pic values of the  <dig> markers were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the mean of non-exclusion probability of one marker, if one parent is known , were  <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

validation of the duplex pcr in identification of selfed progeny using different populations
three populations produced in different environments were used to determine selfing ratios . population 1: a maternal plant  grown in the field condition and its  <dig> putative half-sib progeny were genotyped with  <dig> sets of randomly selected duplex markers . each set contained five duplexes with  <dig> loci on different lgs. one plant  was identified as a contaminant because all alleles of its six loci  were not inherited from k <dig>  the remaining  <dig> plants showed the maternity relatedness with k <dig> and were included in further analysis. the results showed that, if genotyping with one random marker, the mean value of selfing ratio was  <dig> %. as more markers were tested and more polymorphisms were detected between the maternal plant and unknown pollen parents, the cumulative selfing ratio began to decline. when the number of marker loci increased up to eight or more, the cumulative selfing ratio dropped to  <dig> .

population 2: twenty-two different families with totally  <dig> progeny were genotyped for  <dig> loci with five sets of duplex pcr . these progeny plants were from seeds harvested in a field plot by bagging panicles. unexpectedly, of  <dig> progeny,  <dig>  were identified as contaminants because each of them showed no alleles from their corresponding maternal parents in at least two loci . in the remaining  <dig> progeny,  <dig> plants from four families  shared the same alleles from their respective maternal parents, and therefore were identified as selfed progeny . the other  <dig> progeny were identified as hybrids due to their possession of alleles, which were different from their seed parents . later, the  <dig> selfed progeny were further confirmed by detecting two additional ssr duplexes . the overall selfing ratio by the bagging method was only  <dig> %  if contaminants were excluded.

population 3: forty-four progeny plants from seed of a breeding line  grown in a controlled growth chamber, in which another breeding line  was grown as a potential pollen donor, were genotyped with five sets of pcr-duplex . the genotyping results were consistent across all  <dig> ssr loci. for the  <dig> progeny from sl <dig>   <dig>  were identified as originating from self-fertilization and  <dig>  were hybrids between sl <dig> and nl <dig>  sl <dig>  like nl <dig> as reported recently  <cit> , was a self-compatible genotype in the specific environment.

discussion
switchgrass has become one important energy crop in the usa and europe due to its high biomass yield and adaptability on marginal lands, low nutrient and water requirements, and powerful ability as a carbon sink  <cit> . the duplex pcrs consisting of  <dig> ssr markers were the first developed in switchgrass. the protocol was based on a genome-wide selection of ssr marker loci. pcr-multiplexes for genome-wide or nearly genome-wide ssr marker loci have only been developed in limited plant species thus far, including maize  <cit> , sunflower  <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , rice  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . in other crops, such as rapeseed  <cit> , cotton  <cit> , and sorghum  <cit> , multiplex pcr systems have been established, although markers were selected not covering the whole genome.

ssr marker polymorphism
initially, dna samples from eight diverse switchgrass cultivars were pooled together, which not only kept the diversity of different ecotypes of switchgrass but simultaneously minimized the number of genotypes used for the preliminary screening of ssr markers. similar strategy had been used in a previous switchgrass study  <cit> . generally, ssr markers with dinucleotide repeats were more polymorphic than trinucleotide repeats in several plant species, such as barley  <cit> , rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and soybean  <cit> . in this study, of all scorable pps in the preliminary screening, the dinucleotide repeat ssrs produced a significantly greater number of alleles than those with trinucleotide repeats , which was consistent with previous studies in switchgrass  <cit> . however, in the final  <dig> pps selected for duplex pcr, we found that both classes of ssrs were equally polymorphic. the pic values for the selected dinucleotide and trinucleotide ssrs were not significantly different , and the number of alleles per locus were nearly identical  .

duplex pcr
due to the competition of primers, dnas, mg2+, and other reaction components, pcr multiplexing generally requires some optimization  <cit> . in this study, we found increasing taq and mg2+ concentrations improved the duplex pcr quality . previous studies showed that a taq dna polymerase concentration  four to five times greater than that required in monoplex pcr, was necessary to achieve optimal nucleic acid amplification  <cit> . in contrast, the alteration of other pcr components such as pcr buffer constituents, dntps, and primer absolute concentrations in multiplex pcr over those reported for most monoplex pcrs usually resulted in little improvement in the sensitivity or specificity of the test  <cit> . but another study showed that only increasing the buffer concentration markedly improved the quality of multiplex pcr  <cit> . it is evident that the optimization is necessary in developing multiplex pcr  <cit> .

aside from technical factors discussed above, the selection of ssr markers to create pcr duplexes in switchgrass also integrated information of marker map position, allele-length range, genotyping quality, and polymorphism. the  <dig> selected markers covered the major portion of switchgrass genome based on the available genetic maps although they were not evenly distributed in the genome. despite that we tried to select unlinked markers before designing duplex combinations, the selected marker loci in lg 2b and 5b remained linked although most of them > <dig> cm. tightly linked loci are not ideal in paternity analysis because they are usually inherited together, but these markers indeed provide more choices, especially in case some of them lack polymorphisms within and between tested parents.

the band-size separations of individual ssr markers in each duplex combination were mostly more than 10-bp, which should be wide enough to unequivocally score alleles amplified in major switchgrass lowland varieties. even for the nearest distance of non-allelic bands , it could be easily differentiated on frequently-used polyacrylamide gels  <cit> . the duplex marker system might also perform well on capillary electrophoresis instruments due to their similar resolutions with the li-cor dna analyzer used here  <cit> .

ssrs needed for parentage analysis
a comprehensive review of  <dig> articles showed an average of seven microsatellites  was used for plant parentage studies  <cit> . in general, the number of markers required to resolve parentage with a given level of confidence depends on a number of factors. one of the main factors is the expected heterozygosity or polymorphism of each marker  <cit> . of the  <dig> markers, the mean pic value was  <dig> . in an actual example  with  <dig> individuals derived from naturally wind pollination, four sets of randomly selected duplexes containing eight markers were enough to discriminate the breeding origin of each progeny . in another population  harvested from a control environment, theoretically only one polymorphic locus could assign parentage to each progeny plant. therefore, four duplex sets identified in this study would be recommended for the identification of self- or cross-fertilized progeny. thus, the  <dig> sets of duplex ssrs should provide a reservoir used for the breeding origin analysis in switchgrass.

in addition, from population  <dig>  using  <dig> markers, we found the overall selfing ratio of switchgrass plants by bagging their inflorescences was  <dig> %, which was slightly lower than the results in a previous report  <cit> . the bagging method with pillow cases did not produce only selfed progeny, perhaps because openings on pillow cases were bigger than switchgrass pollen grains. previous study showed pollen size of switchgrass was in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm  <cit> . therefore, bagging methods need to be improved if a large number of inbreds are needed in a hybrid breeding program in the future.

implications in other forage species
this study was focused on the tetraploid switchgrass varieties/genotypes. but paternity testing for polysomic genomes is complicated and has not yet been well developed  <cit> . recent studies indicated that tetraploid switchgrass exhibited disomic inheritance  <cit> . so paternity testing for selfing analysis in switchgrass can be implemented by the same ways as diploid species with diploid-specific software . the set of ssr markers selected here are also helpful to identify genotypes, test seed purity, and protect intellectual property in switchgrass. other forage species with diploid and allopolyploid genome structure were reported as well, including creeping bentgrass   <cit> , colonial bentgrass   <cit> , perennial ryegrass   <cit> , italian ryegrass   <cit> , tall fescue   <cit> , meadow fescue   <cit> , white clover   <cit> , red clover   <cit> , and smooth bromegrass   <cit> . similar testing can be expanded into these species.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the genome-wide screening of a large set of ssr markers, we developed a multiple duplex pcr system including  <dig> polymorphic pps. the applications of this ssr test system demonstrated its high discrimination capability and effectiveness for the identification of switchgrass selfed progeny, which were produced on multiple plants in different pollination conditions. the protocol provides ample ssr markers, which should be a powerful tool for the detection of inbreds in switchgrass.
