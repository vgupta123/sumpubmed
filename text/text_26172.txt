BACKGROUND
recently there has been increased interest in pancreatic cholesterol esterase  due to correlation between enzymatic activity in vivo and absorption of dietary cholesterol  <cit> . physiological substrates include cholesteryl esters, retinyl esters, triacylglycerols, vitamin esters, and phospholipids  <cit> . cease plays a role in digestive lipid absorption in the upper intestinal tract, though its role in cholesterol absorption in particular is controversial  <cit> . a recent report indicates that cease is directly involved in lipoprotein metabolism, in that the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of large ldl to smaller, denser, more cholesteryl ester-rich lipoproteins, and that the enzyme may regulate serum cholesterol levels  <cit> . serine lipases, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and cease belong to a large family of proteins called the α/β-hydrolase fold  <cit> , and they share the same catalytic machinery as serine proteases in that they have an active site serine residue which, with a histidine and an aspartic or glutamic acid, forms a catalytic triad  <cit> . the conservation of this catalytic triad suggests that as well as sharing a common mechanism for substrate hydrolysis, that is, formation of a discrete acyl enzyme species via the active site serine hydroxy group, serine proteases, cease, and lipases may well be expected to be inhibited by the same classes of mechanism-based inhibitors such as phosphorothiolates  <cit> , pyrones  <cit> , fluoroketones  <cit> , boronic acids  <cit> , and carbamates  <cit> .

the crystal structure of the active site region of pancreatic cease  <cit>  is similar to torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase   <cit> , candida rugosa lipase   <cit> , geotrichum candidum lipase   <cit> , and pseudomonas species lipase   <cit> . moreover, the active site of cease like crl, gcl, psl, and acetylcholinesterase may consist of at least five major binding sites   <cit> :  an acyl chain binding site  that binds to the acyl chain of the substrate and is opened by the removal of c-terminal 574– <dig> in which is bent in shape and contains a deep, wide hole from the evacuation of phe <dig>   an oxyanion hole , the h-bonding peptide nh functions of gly <dig>  ala <dig>  and ala <dig>  that stabilizes the tetrahedral species,  an esteratic site or the catalytic triad , comprised of ser194-his435-asp <dig>  that is involved in nucleophilic attack to the substrate carbonyl group and in general acid-base catalysis, and  a leaving group binding site  or/and the second alkyl chain or group binding site  that binds to the cholesterol part of cholesterol ester or the second fatty acid chain of triacylglycerol and is located at the opposite direction of abs.

previous work has shown that cease is stereoselectively inhibited by the two atropisomers  of  <dig>  1-bi-2-naphtyl carbamates due to the stereoselective binding at lbs of the enzyme  <cit> . doorn et al. have also reported that cease is stereoselectively inhibited by the four diastereomers of isomalathion due to stereoselectivity for both es and lbs of the enzyme  <cit> . the aim of this study is to extend the stereoselectivity to the four diastereomers of inhibitors by adding two extra bonds between a chiral center and , 2'-n--α-methylbenzylcarbamyl-- <dig>  1'-bi-2-naphthol -1), 2'-n--α-methylbenzylcarbamyl-- <dig>  1'-bi-2-naphthol -1), 2'-n--α-methylbenzylcarbamyl-- <dig>  1'-bi-2-naphthol -1), and 2'-n--α-methylbenzylcarbamyl-- <dig>  1'-bi-2-naphthol -1) , are synthesized from condensation of - or - <dig>  1'-bi-2-naphthol with -or -α-methylbenzyl isocyanate in the presence of pyridine in dichloromethane. the stereoselectivity of cease inhibition by the four diastereomers of  <dig> is evaluated kinetically.

most carbamate inhibitors are characterized as the pseudo substrate inhibitors of cease   <cit>  and meet some of the criteria proposed by abeles and maycock  <cit> . first, the inhibition is time-dependent and follows pseudo-first-order kinetics; second, with increasing concentration of inhibitor the enzyme displays saturation kinetics; third, the enzyme is protected from inhibitions by carbamate by binding of a competitive inhibitor such as trifluoroacetophenone . the ki step leads to the tetrahedral intermediate and the k <dig> step leads to the carbamyl enzyme intermediate. moreover, values of ki and k <dig> can be calculated from equation  <dig>  <cit> :

kapp = k <dig> /+ ) 

in equation  <dig>  kapp values are first-order rate constants which can be obtained as described in hosie et al.  <cit> . bimolecular rate constant, ki = k2/ki, is related to overall inhibitory potency.

RESULTS
for the first time, we synthesize four optical pure diastereomers of  <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  are synthesized from the condensation of r-- or s-- <dig>  1'-bi-2-naphthanol with r-- or s--α-methylbenzyl isocyanate in the presence of a catalytic amount of pyridine in ch2cl <dig>  the  <dig> dvalues for - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> are + <dig>  + <dig>  - <dig>  and -41°, respectively.

like most carbamates, the four diastereomers of  <dig> are characterized as the pseudo substrate inhibitors of cease  and meet some of the criteria proposed by abeles and maycock  <cit> . when cease is incubated with a carbamate in the presence of tfa , a known competitive inhibitor of cease  <cit>  before the inhibition reaction, the enzyme is protected from inhibition by carbamate by binding of tfa as described in hosie et al.  <cit>  .

the inhibition data for cease by the four diastereomers of  <dig> and the two enantiomers of  <dig> are summarized . the stereochemical preference of cease for the binaphthyl moiety of  <dig>  is the same as that for  <dig>  <cit> . the stereoselectivity of cease for the α-methylbenzyl moiety of  <dig> is also the r-form .

ataken from references  <cit> .

among the four diastereomers of  <dig>  - <dig> is the most potent inhibitor and its overall inhibitory potency  is about the same as that of r- <dig> . on the other hand, - <dig> is the least potent inhibitor of cease and its overall inhibitory potency is about 17-fold lower than that of s- <dig>  all k <dig> values for the cease inhibition by <dig> are about the same .

discussion
according to the x-ray crystal structure, cease-catalyzed hydrolysis of cholesteryl linoleate has been proposed   <cit> . like most carbamates, the four diastereomers of  <dig> are characterized as the pseudo substrate inhibitors of cease   <cit>  and meet some of the criteria proposed by abeles and maycock  <cit> . therefore, the cease inhibition by the four diastereomers of 1is proposed   <cit> . in this mechanism, the α-methylbenzylcarbamyl moiety of  <dig> is proposed to bind to abs of the enzyme, and the binaphthyl moiety of  <dig> is proposed to bind to lbs of the enzyme. the stereochemical preference of cease for the binaphthyl moiety of  <dig>  at lbs of the enzyme is therefore identical to that of  <dig>  due to the fact that the nucleophilic attack of the ser <dig> of the enzyme to the carbonyl group of the inhibitor sterically hinder from one of the naphthyl group of the inhibitors   <cit> . since 4-nitrophenyl-n-benzyl-carbamate is a very potent pseudo substrate inhibitor of cease  <cit> , the benzylcarbamyl moiety of the inhibitor is believed to bind tightly to abs of the enzyme. similarly, the α-methylbenzylcarbamyl moiety of  <dig> is also believed to bind to abs of the enzyme. the stereochemical preference of cease for the α-methylbenzylcarbamyl moiety of  <dig> at abs of the enzyme is also r > s . the possible reason for this is the fact that one of the naphthyl group and the α-methyl group of - <dig> are located at the same side of the nucleophilic attack of ser <dig> when the inhibitor binds to cease and therefore these two groups of the inhibitor sterically hinder the nucleophilic attack of ser <dig> to the inhibitor . on the other hand, - <dig> does not have any hindrance for the nucleophilic attack of ser <dig>  and therefore - <dig> is the most potent inhibitor among the four diastereomers of  <dig> .

the stereoselectivity of cease at abs of the enzyme for the α-methylbenzyl group of  <dig>   is the same as that of crl at its abs for 2-methyl-6- hexanate  <cit> . for the ki step , - <dig> and - <dig> bind to cease  <dig>  and  <dig> times more tightly than - <dig> and - <dig>  respectively. the ki value with regard to the chiral center at the α-position of  <dig> is quite low compared to that with regard to the binaphthol chiral axis of  <dig>   <cit>  and to that with regard to the phosphorus chiral center of isomalathion  <cit> . therefore, we propose that abs of cease does not show high selectivity for the chiral acyl group due to a narrow and hydrophobic binding pocket for abs  <cit> , which selectively and tightly binds to the benzyl phenyl moiety of the inhibitor and results in the discrimination of stereoselectivity by either the hydrogen atom or the methyl group at the α-position of the four diastereomers of  <dig> .

- <dig> and - <dig> are bound to cease  <dig> and  <dig> times more tightly than - <dig> and - <dig>  respectively ; however, r- <dig> is bound to cease only  <dig>  times more tightly than s- <dig>  <cit> . the possible reason is that the binding of the phenyl moiety of the α-methylbenzylcarbamyl group of  <dig> to abs  constrains the binaphthol moiety of  <dig> to a more favorable conformation to bind with lbs, on the other hand, the n-butyl carbamyl of  <dig> has lots of room to "breathe" in abs and therefore the binaphthol moiety of <dig> has many conformations and results in loosely binding to lbs.

the k <dig> values for the four diastereomers of  <dig> are about the same. this means that the k <dig> step is insensitive to the stereochemistry of  <dig>  in other words, the stereoselectivity of cease for - <dig> primarily results from the ki step. the k <dig> values for all diastereomers of <dig> are lower than those for the two atropisomers of  <dig> . the possible reason is that the n-butylcarbamyl enzyme from both atropisomers of  <dig> is relatively more stable than the α-methylbenzylcarbamyl enzymes from the four diastereomers of  <dig> 

overall, we report that cease has two stereoselective binding sites at lbs and abs for the four diastereomers of  <dig>  cease  <cit> , chromobacterium viscosum lipase, and rhizopus oryzal lipase  <cit>  also show two stereoselective binding sites at lbs and es for organic phosphorus compounds. therefore, it is possible that cease and lipase may contain totally three stereoselective binding sites at abs, es, and lbs for the six diastereomers of substrates or inhibitors.

CONCLUSIONS
four diastereomers of  <dig> are synthesized and characterized as the pseudo substrate inhibitors of pancreatic cholesterol esterase. the inhibitory potencies for these four diastereomeric inhibitors are in the descending order of - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  the enzyme stereospecificity toward the  <dig>  1'-bi-2-naphthyl moiety of the inhibitors is the r-form and is the same as that for  <dig>  the enzyme stereospecificity toward the α-methylbenzylcarbamyl moiety of the inhibitors is also r-form. for the first time, we observe that the acyl binding site of cholesterol esterase shows stereospecificity for diastereomeric inhibitors.
