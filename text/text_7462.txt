BACKGROUND
pinus flexilis e. james  is a keystone five-needle pine species of the subgenus strobus in mountain-top ecosystems of north america. its high elevation distribution ranges ~ <dig>  m to >  <dig>  m, much wider than any co-occurring conifer tree species. populations dominate in dry, rocky, exposed windswept slopes; and its latitudinal range extends from 33°n to 51°n  <cit> . p. flexilis stands show slow growth in diverse environments across the landscape with longevity of some trees surpassing 1500 years, indicating that adaptation to different habitats has equipped this conifer species with a high capacity for physiological plasticity or broad physiological tolerances  <cit> . the ability of p. flexilis to colonize extreme environments and withstand climate variability makes it ecologically important in high elevation ecosystems. however, white pine blister rust , caused by a non-native fungal pathogen cronartium ribicola , threatens the sustainability of this conifer species and other five-needle pines in north america  <cit> . wpbr, in combination with mountain pine beetle , limber pine dwarf mistletoe , and climate change have caused widespread mortality in p. flexilis and reduced capacity for forest recovery throughout a significant portion of its range ; a 40 % loss in basal area of p. flexilis is projected by  <dig> in the absence of intervention  <cit> .

all native five-needle pines are highly susceptible to wpbr and their wild populations have been impacted to various degrees and at increasing rates  <cit> . to date, resistance breeding has been the main strategy used for wpbr management. genetic resistance to wpbr is determined by dominant major resistance  genes or multiple genes with minor effects in the five-needle pine hosts  <cit> . screening for major gene resistance  in breeding programs has identified four major r genes against c. ribicola, named cr <dig>  cr <dig>  cr <dig>  and cr <dig> in p. lambertiana dougl.   <cit> , p. monticola dougl. ex d. don   <cit> , p. strobiformis engelm.   <cit> , and p. flexilis  <cit> , respectively. these r genes trigger a hypersensitive reaction -like defense that usually limits infection to the needles, precluding stem infection. infection by different virulent inocula indicated that cr <dig>  cr <dig>  and cr <dig> target at different avirulent  alleles  <cit> . cr <dig> shows resistance to the virulent  inoculum that overcomes cr <dig>  <cit> . although the classic gene-for-gene interaction  <cit>  has been demonstrated in these wpbr pathosystems; neither r genes nor their corresponding avcr genes have been molecularly characterized.

genetic maps of cr <dig> and cr <dig> were developed previously , but we still do not know whether five-needle pine r genes are different alleles of the same r gene, or different r genes. the majority of characterized plant r genes belong to the super families encoding proteins with nucleotide binding site/leucine-rich repeat  or encoding receptor-like kinases , which confer hosts complete resistance against various pathogens/pests, including biotrophic fungal pathogens  <cit> . for development of r gene-targeted dna markers, nbs-lrr genes have been isolated from p. monticola  <cit>  and p. lambertiana  <cit> . dna markers  of the nbs-lrr genes were used as functional candidates for r gene characterization in the wpbr pathosystem  <cit> . in the two past decades, various types of dna markers have been developed and used for genetic studies of wpbr resistance or for construction of genetic maps of five-needle pines . however, dna markers have not been developed in p. flexilis, and genetic diversity and molecular mechanisms underlying p. flexilis resistance to wpbr remain poorly understood.

like other pinus species, p. flexilis has a huge genome with  <dig> c of  <dig>  pg  <cit> ; the estimate of total genome length is about  <dig> gbp. although the p. taeda draft genome has been assembled  <cit>  and the cost of next generation sequencing  has decreased, sequencing the p. flexilis genome is still a challenging task due to its huge size. identification of genetic determinants is critical for the development of disease resistant p. flexilis. compared to agricultural plants, conifer breeding is a slow process, because identifying and pyramiding disease tolerance traits is far more challenging in these species with much longer life cycle, and larger but less well characterized genomes. dna markers closely linked to r genes have the potential to strengthen the efficiency of breeding  <cit> . in p. flexilis and other five-needle pines, resistant parents can be identified relatively quickly if a marker-assisted selection  tool is available.

this research was undertaken to identify a large number of snps in the p. flexilis transcriptome de novo assembled by rna-seq analysis. snps were then applied to develop high-throughput genotyping arrays for genetic mapping of a cr <dig> linkage group  using populations selected from current breeding and conservation programs in north america. cr <dig> was anchored on a pinus consensus genetic map by comparison with p. taeda genetic maps.

RESULTS
phenotypic analysis of genetic resistance to c. ribicola
four seedling families were assessed for phenotypic segregation of cr4-mediated resistance for cr <dig> genetic mapping. their seed germination rates varied from 38-75 %, and seedling family ge- <dig>  ge- <dig>  lj- <dig>  and pha- <dig> yielded  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> seedlings, respectively. the inoculation spore density delivered to the seedlings was measured at  <dig>  spores/cm <dig> and c. ribicola basidiospores showed a germination rate of 97 %. each seedling was phenotyped via inspections for signs and symptoms of disease and resistance; early inspections revealed c. ribicola needle infection spots  on all seedlings and 99 % of them presented with more than  <dig> needle infection spots, indicating a successful inoculation that challenged every seedling . cankered seedlings with production of spermatia were considered as a confirmed susceptible genotype, its occurrence ranging from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  %  with an average of  <dig>  %. phenotypic segregation for stem-cankered and stem-canker-free was consistent with previous tests  <cit> .fig.  <dig> disease phenology on pinus flexilis seedlings with rust inoculation at 5-months old. a needle lesions  at 3 months post-inoculation ; b spermatia  evident at  <dig> mpi, with arrows indicating pycnian drops; c susceptible seedling killed by rust; d resistant seedling growing in the 2nd year



p. flexilis needle transcriptome
rna-seq analysis on needle tissues generated approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> million 100 bp pe reads for seedling families mro- <dig>  ut-3359a, and nr- <dig>  respectively. quality filtering by the read trim procedure removed about  <dig>  % of total reads due to low quality. our de novo assembled needle transcriptome using trinity contained  <dig>  transcripts with n <dig> at  <dig> -bp and total transcriptome length of  <dig>  mbp . the mrna sequences were predicted as expressed from  <dig>  unigene sequences. a blastx search using the p. taeda proteome  revealed the transcriptome assembly contained  <dig>  unique gene sequence highly conserved between p. flexilis and p. taeda . a total of  <dig>  unique gene sequences showed significantly homology hits  to the p. taeda proteome. these  <dig>  pinus conserved unigene sequences covered a total p. flexilis exome sequence length of  <dig>  mbp, which accounts for  <dig>  % of the  <dig>  gbp genome of p. flexilis. a tblastn search of the p. taeda protein database  against our p. flexilis transcripts revealed that  <dig>  % of them had significant homology hits  , suggesting that our de novo assembled p. flexilis transcriptome may have a relatively high coverage.

p. flexilis nbs-lrr genes and defense-related genes in response to c. ribicola infection were predicted using a blast search against the corresponding sequence sets from p. monticola. blastx analysis  identified  <dig>  transcripts encoding nbs-lrr proteins expressed from  <dig> unigenes, and blastn analysis  identified  <dig>  transcripts encoding putative wpbr-responsive proteins expressed from  <dig> unigenes in the p. flexilis needles .

transcriptome comparison analysis identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  between resistant seedling family  and susceptible seedling families . a total of  <dig> transcripts were expressed from these degs, and  <dig> degs for  <dig> transcripts were commonly detected in both comparisons of transcriptomes: nr- <dig> vs. mro- <dig>  or nr- <dig> vs. ut-3359a . as revealed by go annotation analysis on degs, the three top subcategories under the biological process category were oxidation-reduction process , cellular protein metabolic process , and response to stress . fifty-three and  <dig> deg sequences encoded for putative r-homologs  and pathogenesis-related proteins, respectively. this evidence suggests that degs may be involved in disease resistance and/or adaptation to local habitats.fig.  <dig> transcriptome analysis of gene expression levels using rna-seq. a venn diagrams of differentially expressed genes  as detected by comparisons of transcriptomes between resistant  and susceptible  seedling families. numbers of transcripts expressed from degs are shown in the parentheses. b expression values  of the genes with snps selected for design of genotyping arrays. fpkm values were mapped to the genes in order from the largest to the smallest values, using the transcriptome of the resistant seedling family nr- <dig> as a reference



in silico snp calling
using our de novo assembled transcriptome as a reference, a total of  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels were called in the three seedling families, and these polymorphisms were distributed among  <dig>  transcripts expressed from  <dig>  unique genes. on average, we detected  <dig>  snps per unigene and  <dig>  snps per kb. of  <dig>  p. flexilis unigene sequences highly conserved between p. flexilis and p. taeda ,  <dig>   were polymorphic with snp distribution. a blastn search against p. taeda mapped gene sequences  <cit> , yielded  <dig>  p. flexilis polymorphic genes with identical hits , providing anchored conserved genes for comparative mapping between p. taeda and p. flexilis.

nucleotide variation counts detected  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  snps; as well as  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> indels in the seedling families mro- <dig>  ut-3359a, nr- <dig>  respectively. the majority of nucleotide variations  were seed family-specific. nucleotide variations shared among seed families were limited. pair-wise comparison among the three seedling families revealed that only about 20 % of total snps from one seedling family were shared with another family ; i.e. most nucleotide variations were localized within individual seedling families. those mgr seedling family-specific snps were potential sites for searching for cr4-linked dna markers at a next step.fig.  <dig> number of single nucleotide polymorphisms detected in three seedling families of pinus flexilis. the intersecting portions of the venn diagram illustrate the number of shared loci in pair-wise comparison of seedling families



cr <dig> genetic mapping by high-throughput snp genotyping
a total of  <dig> in silico snps were selected in candidate gene groups  with high conservation among pinus, and used to design sequenom genotyping arrays. in addition to snp coverages, gene expression was also considered in snp selection. as shown in fig. 2b, a majority of genes with selected snps  shows good transcript expression ,  <dig> genes were expressed differentially between resistant and susceptible seed families . others were included due to their high homologies with candidate groups. these snp markers were screened in the seedlings with identified phenotypes following c. ribicola infection. seventy-two snps were selected to genotype all megagametophyte samples from four maternal trees. after manually checking snps, we constructed individual linkage maps for each maternal tree separately . linkage of snp markers to cr4-mediated phenotypes was significant in all four maternal trees . the snp markers shared among the four maternal trees were aligned manually and a total of  <dig> snp markers were found to reside in  <dig> unique genes .fig.  <dig> genetic linkage map of snp markers in seedling families ge- <dig>  ge- <dig>  lj- <dig>  and pha- <dig>  three snp markers that segregated in all four genotyped seedling families are shown by red lines




among the  <dig> cr4-linked snp markers, only three  were shared across all four maternal trees. the same allele at each of these three shared snp loci was linked in coupling to the resistant allele at the cr <dig> locus in all four families used in the mapping experiments described here. nine snp loci  were mapped in repulsion on the cr4-lgs in different maternal trees. these results indicated high genetic divergence among the maternal trees from different geographical regions.

the order of the snp markers was highly consistent across the maternal trees. multiple snps from the same gene sequence  were usually mapped at the same position on the lg. a consensus cr4-lg was constructed by merging four individual maternal maps with a total length of 47 cm and an average density of  <dig>  cm per snp marker. the cr <dig> region was highly saturated; and snp markers snp290363y and snp296815y were closest to cr <dig> with genetic distances at  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm respectively .

comparative genetic map of cr <dig> linkage group
we compared the cr4-lg to p. taeda consensus maps reported recently  <cit> . all  <dig> genes mapped on the cr4-lg showed identical hits to p. taeda genes, with blastn e-values ranging from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> . all  <dig> pinus highly conserved genes were localized on the p. taeda consensus lg8; and  <dig> of them were mapped with relative positions on lg <dig>  the cr4-lg shows high collinearity when the snp markers are compared according to the corresponding functional genes they tag . the relative order of the mapped genes is highly correlated among two pinus species with pearson correlation r2 =  <dig>   . the comparative mapping anchored cr <dig> on the pinus consensus lg <dig> at a position around  <dig>  cm.fig.  <dig> scatter plot analysis to evaluate the correlation of marker positions of pinus highly conserved genes between pinus flexilis and p. taeda. p. taeda gene positions on pinus consensus linkage group  <dig> were reported previously by westbrook et al.  <cit> . the symbol "+" indicates the predicted position of the cr <dig> locus



functional genes close to cr4
the  <dig> functional genes localized on the cr4-lg map were annotated, and  <dig> of them encode proteins with putative biological functions . several genes close to cr <dig> were revealed with potential roles in genetic resistance against pathogens/pests, and they encoded putative proteins with significant homologies to class iv chitinase, notum homolog isoform x <dig>  zinc finger ccch domain-containing  protein, benzyl alcohol o-benzoyl transferase , aleurain-like thiol protease , nodulation-signaling pathway  <dig> , and galactinol synthase  <dig>  . other annotated genes that were mapped on the cr4-lg included those encoding proteins with homologies to nbs-lrr protein, expansin, shisa- <dig>  endoglucanase, and protein sensitive to proton rhizotoxicity, suggesting their functions in plant defense responses to environmental stresses.

discussion
transcriptome snp development by rna-seq analysis
in the present study, cr <dig> was mapped using a research strategy that integrated snp development using rna-seq analysis and subsequent high-throughput genotyping with only a few hundred in silico genic snp markers. recently we used this strategy for genetic identification of functional genes in significant linkage disequilibrium with p. monticola cr <dig> for major gene resistance to c. ribicola  <cit> . as the cost is low and affordable for most research labs, this strategy may be useful for similar research on non-model conifer species. the p. flexilis de novo assembled transcriptomes and large number of genic snps identified in this study may provide useful genomic resources for further investigation of resistance mechanisms and selective adaptation to biotic/abiotic stresses and climate change in other native north american five-needle pines.

molecular breeding of five-needle pines for resistance to wpbr would benefit from recent advance in conifer genomics studies, including the p. taeda genome sequence, the recent release of the p. lambertiana draft genome assembly  <cit>  , and de novo assembled transcriptomes and related ngs data from other five-needle pines  <cit> . genome annotation for protein-coding genes in pinus species  <cit>  provides a valuable source of genic dna markers for comparative analysis among related conifer species, with a high potential to determine candidates for map-based gene cloning and identification of functional markers for marker assisted selection in the wpbr pathosystems. research approaches for this study have integrated genomic information previously reported in the genus pinus to generate a consensus genetic map for cr4-lg, an important step towards p. flexilis molecular breeding and further genomics research on resistance mechanisms.

construction of cr4-lg consensus map using functional snp markers
traditional dna markers  are developed on random genomic sequences without knowledge of the causal genes. marker discovery has been greatly improved as ngs technologies have advanced and whole genome or transcriptome sequences in non-model plants have become available. the majority of snp markers discovered through a strategy of genotyping by sequencing were localized in the non-genic regions  <cit> . recently rna-seq-based transcriptome profiling has been widely used for snp discovery in forest conifer species . snp markers derived from transcriptomes represent alleles of functional genes with transcript expression. the functional snps targeted at exomes may cause amino acid changes in the encoded proteins, with differentiation of protein structures and biochemical properties. this type of dna marker thus has a potential to provide direct insight into the biological contribution of alleles underlying physiological traits of interest  <cit> .

we constructed a consensus map by genetically localizing cr <dig> using  <dig> snp markers that represented  <dig> unique genes. these cr4-linked genic snp markers were selected from in silico snps by transcriptome comparison between cr4-resistant and cr4-susceptible seedling families. common snp loci among four maternal trees that originated in three different geographical regions were used to build a consensus map for cr4-lg. comparison of the cr4-lg maps among the four maternal trees revealed highly consistent marker orders for the  <dig> mapped genes, by which the consensus cr4-lg map was constructed. we observed small discrepancies for the cr <dig> position in four individual cr4-maps, which may not suggest real chromosome rearrangements because different numbers of susceptible samples were calculated in each mapping population. as more recombination events are expected in the larger population resulting from the merging of four maternal trees, the cr <dig> position on the consensus map is theoretically more reliable.

cr <dig> is anchored on the pinus consensus lg8
localization of  <dig> pinus conserved genes in the consensus cr4-lg map gives us a solid framework for further comparative analysis of p. flexilis resistance with other pine species. by comparison with recently updated p. taeda consensus genetic maps  <cit> , we anchored cr <dig> to the pinus consensus lg <dig> with a predicted location at  <dig>  cm. the highly syntenous relationship between cr4-lg and the pinus consensus lg <dig>  will guide fine mapping using larger populations to increase marker density in the genomic region of cr <dig> in a future study. application of consensus maps with syntenic markers localized p. lambertiana cr <dig> on the pinus consensus lg <dig>  <cit> , the same lg where p. taeda fr <dig> for resistance to fusiform rust pathogen cronartium quercuum sp. fusiforme  was localized  <cit> . p. monticola cr <dig> was localized on pinus consensus lg <dig> .

localization of cr <dig>  cr <dig>  and cr <dig> on different lgs  indicates that r genes against c. ribicola have evolved independently in five-needle pines. c. ribicola invaded into north america only about one hundred years ago, suggesting that occurrence of the five-needle pine r genes is not caused by pathogen selection pressure and that they may have already been present in wild populations at rare frequencies in north america before the arrival of c. ribicola. furthermore, the maternal trees sampled in this study, except pha <dig>  are from sites not yet invaded by c. ribicola. a further genomic comparison of pinus r genes against c. ribicola and c. quercuum f. sp. fusiforme would generate new insights into the evolution of the innate immune response within the genus  <cit> .

cr <dig> functional candidates
localization of functional genes as well as their snps on the cr4-lg facilitates cr <dig> characterization at the molecular level. genetic mapping of the r gene families is an effective strategy for identification of positional r-gene candidates, development of high-density r-gene genetic maps, and design of diagnostic markers for breeding selection of resistance genotypes and qtl  <cit> . several genes with tight linkage to cr <dig> were identified as functional r candidate genes and defence-related genes in the p. flexilis immune system.

contig_ <dig>  encoding a nbs-lrr protein as a homolog of the tobacco n protein against tobacco mosaic virus , was mapped at a position of ~25 cm from cr <dig>  which indicates that it is not the cr <dig> candidate. however, >60 % of nbs-lrr genes are organized in clusters in angiosperms, and r-genes families have been expanded by lineage-specific tandem duplications with high sequence similarity between duplicated gene copies  <cit> . therefore, searching lp- <dig> homologs is probably useful in finding other nbs-lrr genes as cr <dig> positional candidates. p. flexilis contigs lp- <dig>  lp- <dig>  and lp- <dig> were localized within about one cm from cr <dig>  providing landmark genes for searching for cr <dig> candidates on the pinus consensus maps. one cm genetic distance probably covers about  <dig> mbp of genomic dna sequence on the pinus physical map  <cit> . as p. taeda and p. lambertiana genome draft assemblies are updated with improved completeness, this length of dna sequence can be scrutinized for members of r gene families , which may include the targeted cr <dig> gene itself.

six functional genes were uncovered in a range of 3 cm from cr <dig> encoding proteins with putative physiological roles in disease resistance, including class iv chitinase, notum homolog, c3h-type zf protein, benzyl alcohol o-benzoyltransferase, aleurain-like thiol protease, and nsp <dig>  class iv endochitinaes are a group of pathogenesis-related  proteins functioning in plant defence against pathogens  <cit> . as glycosyl hydrolases, they catalyze the degradation of chitin, a β- <dig> -linked polymer of n-acetylglucosamine , a major structural component of fungal cell walls. p. monticola class iv endochitinases were up-regulated in both resistant and susceptible seedlings post-c. ribicola infection  <cit> , and an association study demonstrated their significant contribution to partial resistance to c. ribicola  <cit> .

c3h-type zf proteins may have regulatory functions in mrna processing during a series of plant developmental and adaptive processes, including plant defense responses to biotic stresses  <cit> . most c3h-type zf genes are regulated by biotic or abiotic stresses in arabidopsis and rice, suggesting that they may be involved in plant tolerance to stresses  <cit> . in the p. monticola c3h-type zf family, expression of two members are upregulated in response to c. ribicola infection, one responsive in both resistant and susceptible genotypes and another responsive only in cr2-resistant seedlings  <cit> . a loss-of-function mutant of an arabidopsis c3h-type zf protein showed an increased local susceptibility to a fungal pathogen and sensitivity to seed germination in the presence of aba  <cit> . overexpression of a cotton c3h-type zf gene  in transgenic tobacco increased resistance to a pathogenic fungus  and enhanced tolerance to salt stress  <cit> .

notum-homologs encode pectinacetylesterase  in plants and fungi, catalyzing the deacetylation of pectin, a major compound of primary cell walls. decreased pectin acetylation resulted in increased arabidopsis resistance to microbial pathogens , suggesting that pectin acetylation may play an important role in plant resistance to pathogens. transgenic arabidopsis plants with over-expression of an aspergillus nidulans pae gene  showed reduction of pectin and xyloglucan acetylation and enhanced resistance to botrytis cinerea, which probably is achieved by h2o <dig> accumulation, up-regulation of defense-related genes, and callose deposition  <cit> . deacetylated pectin is more easily degraded by endogenous and microbial polygalacturonases , leading to the accumulation of active oligogalacturonide , and the latter functions as damage associated molecular patterns  in plant immunity system for constitutive and pathogen-induced resistance against pathogens  <cit> .

a benzyl alcohol o-benzoyltransferase gene was up-regulated in tobacco leaves during a hr response to a pathogen infection  <cit> . this enzyme is probably involved in the formation of volatile ester benzylbenzoate, and at least some of these volatile esters may serve as antimicrobial or antifungal agents to prevent further spread of disease  <cit> . the biotrophic fungal pathogen cladosporium fulvum contains a virulence factor  that inhibits several host proteases  required for plant basal defense  <cit> .

nsp <dig> is a member of the gras transcription factor family. gras transcription factors are proposed to have high functional diversity and may act as integrators of multiple growth regulatory and environmental signals in non-legume plants. gras transcripts accumulated in tomato during incompatible interactions and silencing one of them impaired host resistance to bacterial speck disease  <cit> . the presence of nbs-lrr type r genes is possibly connected to repression of gras transcriptional regulators during interactions of potato  with phytophthora infestans  <cit> . all of these results suggest that the cr4-linked candidate genes may have putative roles in the plant immune system at different levels. however, none of these candidates may encode for an r protein directly involved in recognition of the c. ribicola avirulence factor , and the physiological roles of these genes in cr4-mediated resistance still has to be investigated.

potential application of cr4-lg maps in mgr breeding
snp markers of the cr4-lg provide targeted genomic dna sequences to develop mas tools for p. flexilis breeding and conservation programs. the match rate of snp genotypes with the phenotypic traits is an important factor for considering application of snp markers in practical selection of desired plant traits and prediction of related phenotypic development  <cit> , which depends on genetic distances between diagnostic markers and targeted genes that control the phenotypic trait. ideal dna markers should be valid at the species level across all geographic regions the plant species is distributed. a perfect match between genotypes of snps and the cr4-mediated resistant phenotype was not detected consistently in all four mapped seedling families in the present study. the numbers of populations and snps were still limited for discovery of nbs-lrr or rlk genes with tight linkage to cr <dig>  due to complex genomes, long life cycles, and difficulty in phenotyping, similar limitations were encountered in genetic mapping of other forest species . therefore, more research is needed to achieve complete accuracy of phenotype prediction within a molecular breeding program of a forest species. functional snps within the cr <dig> gene itself would be an ideal genomic tool for mgr selecting in p. flexilis, but positional cloning and functional determination of a conifer gene still requires considerable research effort. nonetheless, following molecular characterization of r genes, r allele-specific sequences have been used to create marker-assisted tools for plant breeders to select resistance genotypes  <cit> .

the present work identified snp marker snp290363y closest to cr <dig> in the seed family ge- <dig> , but it did not segregate in other three mapped seedling families. searching additional snps from the gene contig_ <dig>  or other pinus conserved genes with physical linkage to this gene in the p. taeda genome sequence, may lead to identification of dna markers for cr <dig> selection with application in a wider range of p. flexilis populations.

markers snp296815y and snp204077r <dig> segregated in all four mapped seedling families and placed at loci to cr <dig> at genetic distance of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm on the consensus cr4-lg. the same allele at these two snp loci was linked in coupling to the resistant allele at the cr <dig> locus in all four mapped seedling families, suggesting there may be a potential to use the snp markers in selection of resistant progeny in related seedling families. it waits further confirmation if these two snp markers are valid or not in more geographic regions. using genome-wide genetic markers, genomic selection has the potential to improve p. taeda breeding by shortening the current breeding cycle from  <dig> to 20 years to less than 7 years  <cit> . currently it takes 1 ~ 2 years for mgr screening in five-needle pines by artificial rust inoculation in greenhouses. application of dna markers will decrease selection time to one or two months as mgr prediction can be performed at the seed germination stage using a segment of cotyledons before limber pine seedlings are planted.

for many of the high elevation five-needle pines, including p. flexilis, little breeding work is done. there will be selection, identification of resistant parents ; then management strategies will be developed accordingly  <cit> . in many cases seed is collected from wild populations, or from resistant parents to use for restoration or reforestation. therefore, a technique like mas which requires only needle collections, rather than cone collections followed by progeny tests, can greatly accelerate the identification of resistant seed trees across the landscape. for p. flexilis, genomic-based tools can assess the cr <dig> status of younger non-reproductive trees in the field currently untestable with progeny tests, enabling timely assessments of the presence and frequency of cr <dig> in populations that have sustained high mortality of mature trees as a result of disturbance such as the recent mountain pine beetle  epidemic. estimates of the frequency of cr <dig> in stands and knowing how many mgrs there are in the species would help guide management actions  <cit> . in addition, the ability to confirm the cr <dig> status of a formerly disease-free tree with recent wpbr symptoms allows for rapid detection of the evolution of virulence  in c. ribicola.

the snp marker snp204077r <dig> results in an amino acid change  of galactinol synthase  <dig>  suggesting it may be functional marker affecting enzymatic activity. arabidopsis galactinol synthase is stress-inducible and plays a key role in the accumulation of galactinol and raffinose as osmoprotectants in drought-stress tolerance of plants  <cit> . vogan and schoettle  <cit>  found that cr <dig> seedling families constitutively exhibited greater cold hardiness and lower stomatal conductance than susceptible seedling families during moderate drought. these results suggest that cr <dig> and drought-tolerance genes may be co-inherited and there is a potential to select p. flexilis genotypes for better fitness to both biotic and abiotic stresses under a warming climate.

in addition to host markers for marker-assisted selection, pathogen effectors are now applied as molecular markers that accelerate and improve plant breeding of genetic resistance to various pathogens/pests  <cit> . as the c. ribicola reference transcriptome has been assembled and putative pathogenic effectors were identified  <cit> , the avcr candidates can be used as pathogenic baits for biochemical screening of their corresponding r products in the five-needle pine. molecular elucidation of the gene-for-gene model during five-needle pine-blister rust interactions is another strategy that could lead to the identification of the r genes in the wpbr pathosystems.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study represents the first research on genetic mapping of the p. flexilis major gene  for resistance against c. ribicola by genotyping snps of candidate genes discovered by rna-seq analysis. the first snp dataset with more than  <dig>  novel snps were uncovered in the p. flexilis exomes from three seedling families. a large number of non synonymous snps for amino acid changes in the encoded proteins provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the genetic variability of pest/pathogen resistance and other adaptive traits.
