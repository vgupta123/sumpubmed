BACKGROUND
soybean  merr.) is the most important economic and nutritional legume crop for both oil and protein products worldwide  <cit> . however, a variety of abiotic stresses and biotic stress are threatening the world's soybean production every year. after scarcity of water, seed yield losses in soybean are mainly due to pest and pathogen infections  <cit> . one of the most destructive pests of soybean is the soybean cyst nematode . it can cause various symptoms after infection such as chlorotic patches within leaflets, root necrosis and suppression of root growth. yield losses in the world due to scn infection have approached $ <dig> billion a year  <cit> . once established in a field, the infestations have been difficult to eradicate. eight races of scn are found   <cit>  in china. race  <dig> is predominant in the northeastern provinces of china .

although biological controls and transgenic technology have some promise, breeding the pest-resistant materials was still the only effective control method by  <dig>  <cit> . there were more than  <dig> soybean accessions from asia that contained scn resistance genes, but only a few of them had been utilized for developing us cultivars and nearly all the resistance genes in developed varieties were from two sources, 'peking' and 'pi88788'  <cit> .

inheritance of resistance to scn was first reported in peking when three resistance genes  were identified  <cit> . the rhg <dig> locus has been shown to have the greatest impact on the development of scn from all hg types in several resistance sources including peking, pi <dig> and pi <dig>  although originally reported as a recessive locus, the rhg <dig> locus has more recently been characterized as incomplete dominant or dominant depending on the hg type  <dig> used  <cit> . the fourth resistance gene rhg <dig> had been confirmed as being necessary for full resistance to some races of scn in peking but not pi <dig>  it behaved as a dominant gene in peking-derived sources. both rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> were necessary for the full resistance to scn race  <dig> and  <dig>  an additional dominant gene was identified in pi <dig> and was designated rhg <dig> that also had been characterized as a dominant gene  <cit> .

hg types and plant resistance were both shown to be temperature dependent. as the traditional breeding process is time consuming and labor intensive, new cultivar breeding usually could not adapt with the speed of drift among pathogen populations driven by mutations within massive field populations. therefore, new methodologies for scn resistance breeding were required. genetic marker technology has facilitated the identification, localization and characterization of qtl associated with important agronomic traits including scn resistance  <cit> . dna-based techniques such as micro satellites  have been used extensively for soybean gene mapping, because they are abundant, uniformly distributed, highly polymorphic, codominant, rapidly produced by pcr, relatively simple to interpret, and easily accessed by other laboratories via published primer sequences. further, they have been used to anchor the soybean genome sequence  <cit> . consequently, numerous publications have appeared on the identification and localization of qtl underlying resistance to scn  <cit> . the marker assisted selection provided the potential to develop scn resistance in soybean cultivars tested in single environments, often in greenhouse assays. for instance, soybean jtn- <dig>  jtn- <dig> , were the first soybean lines developed using mas for nematode resistance  <cit> .

the scn resistance gene rhg <dig> was inferred to be linked with pblt <dig>  pblt <dig> and i gene for seed coat color on linkage group a <dig>   <cit> . qtl identified and localized for scn resistance based on both genotypic and phenotypic data in a segregating population was first reported by concibido et al.  <cit> . during the following decade, a total of  <dig> scn resistant qtl were reported on the following linkage groups: a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  d1a, d <dig>  e, f, g, h, i, j, l, m, and n  <cit> . qtl on the lg g near rhg <dig> was detected in most studies and was considered to be one of the major genes underlying resistance to scn. nearly 80% of these studies used the scn hg type  <dig>  resistance because it was the main cause of yield reduction among soybeans grown in many areas, including northeast of china. a minor qtl s16- <dig> on lg k provided 5% additive effects for resistance to scn race  <dig> had been reported in  <dig>  this was the first report of a qtl on linkage group k associated with scn resistance  <cit> . another qtl was detected on lg d <dig>  and associated with the resistance to hg types  <dig> - and  <dig> .5-  <cit> .

candidate genes underlying qtl were identified and one, a lecine-rich repeat  trans-membrane  receptor like kinase  was tested in transgenic plants  <cit> . resistance was provided to scn and a fungal pathogen, fusarium virguliforme. in contrast, another rlk in the rhg <dig> interval was shown not to underlie the resistance locus  <cit> . candidate genes underlying other loci were not reported to date.

cultivars with broad-spectrum resistance to scn were available in china and may be more useful than those that had specific resistance. 'heinong 37' was shown to be genetically distinct from scn resistant cultivars with high yielding under continuous culture  <cit> . 'l-10' was resistant to different races of scn . the objectives of the present study were to confirm the previously reported qtl, to identify new qtl associated with broad-spectrum resistance to multiple scn races and to examine candidate genes underlying selected qtl using the cross of 'heinong 37' and 'l-10'.

RESULTS
linkage analysis
a total of  <dig> ssr markers were used for detecting polymorphisms between the two parents, and  <dig> of them  were polymorphic among the rils. it was remarkable that the ratio of polymorphic markers was extremely high on lg g and lg j . a total of  <dig> ssr markers that were polymorphic among rils were mapped onto the integrated soybean linkage map designed by song et al.  <cit> . chi-square tests of these markers fitted well the expected ratio of 1: <dig> for genotypes aa: bb.

female index analysis based on the greenhouse data
the female index was significantly different between the two parents, 'l-10'  and 'heinong 37' . the mean female index across the ril population was  <dig>  to  <dig>  for race  <dig> and  <dig>  to  <dig> % for race  <dig> in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the range of female index for the race  <dig> was much wider than that for the race  <dig> in both  <dig> and  <dig> . the shaprio-wilks tests showed that the frequency distribution of female index significantly deviated from normal distribution model . however, using the sas normal logarithm conversion of the data resulted in normal distributions for these female index data  .

qtl analyses based on the greenhouse loss data
the map distance between molecular markers and the associated qtl were calculated by winqtl  <dig> . qtl were relevant to scn resistance based on the greenhouse female index data in this study . qtl qscn3- <dig> on mlg e was detected in the interval satt573-satt <dig> that explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation for scn race  <dig> resistance in  <dig> and  <dig>  a major qtl, qscn3- <dig>  was located on mlg g in the interval satt275-satt <dig> and accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation for scn race  <dig> resistance in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. on mlg j, qscn3- <dig> was detected in the interval sat_350-satt <dig> that explained  <dig> % and  <dig>  of the phenotypic variation for scn race  <dig> resistance in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in the same interval, qtl qscn14- <dig> was mapped approximately  <dig>  cm from the marker satt <dig> and accounted for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation for scn race  <dig> resistance in  <dig>  there were two qtl-qscn14- <dig> and qscn14- <dig> for scn race  <dig> resistance were detected on mlg o in the intervals satt345-satt <dig> and satt153-satt <dig> that explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance in both years, and  <dig> % in  <dig>  qtl qscn14- <dig> accounting for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation was found on mlg d <dig> between satt <dig> and satt <dig> for scn race  <dig> resistance in  <dig> .

a r <dig> was the proportion of the phenotypic data explained by the marker locus; b lod was log of odd score; c sem : sd√n where sd was standard deviation and n was the number of each of allele.

the flanking markers sat_ <dig> and satt <dig> could be used for the selection of the qtl that underlay both resistances to scn race  <dig> and scn race  <dig>  the total phenotypic variation explained by qscn3- <dig> and qscn3- <dig> together was  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the year  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. further, the flanking markers satt <dig>  satt <dig>  sat_ <dig> and satt <dig> were used for the selection of resistant lines to scn race  <dig>  the accuracy of selection was about 73% in this rils population from the cross between 'l-10' and 'heinong 37' .

candidate gene detection and transcript abundance analysis
all the qtl mentioned above were projected on the genetic map gmcomposite <dig> based on the homothetic function. for the interval between sat_ <dig> and satt <dig> that contained the genes underlying resistance to both scn race  <dig> and scn race  <dig>  the qtl was first projected on the genome map according to the physical distance ratio of genetic distance of  <dig> kbp/cm between the two dna markers. a total of  <dig> putatively gene encoded sequences encompassed in this region were used for resistance gene analog  detection by the hmmsearch program. six encoded sequences were considered to be candidate scn r-genes . according to the conversed domain shared by all the r-genes, all of these six encoded sequences were identified to encode lrr-tm-pk protein  <cit> . it was notable that these encoded sequences were organized in a cluster on the chromosome  <dig> . four encoded sequences within this cluster of chromosome  <dig> were successfully amplified by rt-pcr and showed a high homology with other lrr-tm-pk type of resistance genes . the results of semi-quantitative rt-pcr showed that glyma16g <dig>  was only abundant in the scn resistant cultivar 'l-10' but not in susceptible 'heinong 37'. further, the transcript abundance was higher in root than in leaf for 'l-10'. therefore, the gene might play a role in the scn resistance . future analyses would be focused to determine the role in the resistance mechanism underlain by glyma16g <dig> .

discussion
the scn resistance line 'l-10' had a broad-spectrum resistant to scn. there was great interest in transferring the scn resistance of this cultivar into other cultivars. traditional identification processes were time consuming and labor intensive. increasing the selection intensity by marker-assisted selection of genotypes and subsequently more limited phenotypic selection will lead to improved the selection gains.

segregation distortion had been reported repeatedly in soybean inbred line populations segregating for the soybean cyst nematode resistance locus rhg <dig>  but the frequency of the scn resistance allele was lower than expected  <cit> . in this study, qtl qscn3- <dig> that was within the same region as the rhg <dig> locus was only detected in about one fourth of the population based on the flanking markers satt <dig> and satt <dig>  the flanking markers sat_ <dig> and satt <dig> for qscn3- <dig> were only detected in nearly one third of the population. it was reported by kopisch-obuch et al.  that the association between the resistance allele and reduced field emergence contributed to the segregation distortion at the scn resistance loci  <cit> . in contrast, webb et al.  reported that either gametic or zygotic selection driven by a second locus on lg m that had to be inherited in phase were responsible  <cit> . in the present study, the ril population performed a skewness distribution due to non-typical quantitative trait of cyst nematode resistance. however, using the sas normal logarithm conversion of the data resulted in normal distributions for these female index data, which could be used for qtl mapping.

two major qtl  were identified to be significantly associated with the resistance to scn race  <dig>  the two qtl jointly explained about 40% of the total phenotypic variation. the qtl qscn3- <dig> fell within a similar marker interval  previously reported associated with resistance to scn race  <dig>  this region was considered to be the rhg <dig> locus. the rhg <dig> locus had been shown to have an impact on scn development in several resistance lines and provided resistance to many common scn populations such as race  <dig> and  <dig>  many research groups have mapped the rhg <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig>  to a location approximately  <dig>  cm from satt <dig>  <cit> .

the interval on lg j contained both qscn3- <dig> and qscn14- <dig>  might underlie multi-races resistance to scn in soybean  <cit> . in this study, no qtl was identified on the lg a <dig>  the rhg <dig> locus was considered to be another main qtl for scn resistance, tightly linked to i locus  <cit> . four alleles were known at i, the dominant allele inhibited seed coat pigmentation, leading to possession of a yellow seed coat, whereas the recessive i allele conferred a pigmented seed coat. two other alleles, ii and ik, gave rise to restricted pigmentation of the hilum and the saddle-shaped region, respectively  <cit> . in our work, there was no significant correlation between the color of seed coat  and scn resistance. this result indicated that the line 'l-10' had another locus for resistance to scn race  <dig> independent of the rhg <dig> locus. this locus may be similar to the lg j locus found in pi  <dig>  <cit> .

the scn resistance alleles were previously associated with maturity, plant height, and lodging scores  <cit> . in contrast there were some rhg <dig> scn resistance alleles from g. soja either had no effect or significantly  enhanced yield compared with the susceptible alleles  <cit> . here the correlation analysis suggested that some morphological traits such as plant height, color of pod coat, 100-seed weight and maturity were significantly associated with scn resistance. soybeans with tall stems, large seed size, late maturity and low protein content were correlated with scn resistance for both race  <dig> and  <dig> . the use of the 'l-10' scn resistance loci would provide breeders with an alternative source of scn resistance that was not associated with reduced yield.

two ssr markers, satt <dig> and satt <dig> on mlg g, were tightly linked to the major qtl qscn3- <dig>  sat_ <dig> and satt <dig> on mlg j were tightly linked to the qtl qscn3- <dig> and qscn14- <dig>  the total phenotypic variation explained by qscn3- <dig> and qscn3- <dig> together was  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the year  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and these four markers had potential use for marker-assisted selection of lines resistant to the scn race  <dig>  it was showed that nearly 80% of lines with the alleles of these four markers that were contributed by 'l-10' provided high resistance or completely immunity . as the rhg <dig> locus has been characterized as incompletely dominant, soybean lines heterozygous at this locus often allowed cyst formation at a rate intermediate between the genotype of homozygous resistant and homozygous susceptible  <cit> . here some lines were still heterozygous at the rhg <dig> locus after mas, suggesting a more accurate gene based selection was needed for the greater accuracy  <cit> .

qscn14- <dig> might underlie multi-races resistance in soybean. kanazin et al.  identified a gene cluster that contained eight rgas on lg j in the similar region  <cit> . further, six members of the rlk family were involved in one cluster on chromosome j. among these the rlk gene glyma16g <dig>  was found to accumulate transcripts in the scn resistance cultivar 'l-10' but not in 'heinong 37' and the transcript abundance was higher in root than in leaf for 'l-10', suggesting that the gene might play a role in the scn resistance to race  <dig> and race  <dig>  melito et al.  suggested that the rlk at rhg <dig> was involved in root development but not nematode development as shown by others  <cit> . unfortunately, the study of melito et al.  was flawed by the lack of an analysis of the target rlk protein abundance despite the available antibodies. further studies of the rlks at rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> will be needed for the clarification of the resistance mechanism and involvement of the candidate genes.

glyma16g <dig>  was tightly linked to the qtl qscn3- <dig> and qscn14- <dig>  indicating that this gene might be associated with both scn race  <dig> and race  <dig> resistance. therefore, a real-time pcr combined with molecular marker-based selection could be used for the future breeding of scn resistant lines.

CONCLUSIONS
the four main ssr markers, satt <dig>  satt <dig>  sat_ <dig> and satt <dig>  which were tightly linked to the major qtl for resistance to scn on lg g and j, would be candidates for marker-assisted selection of lines resistant to the scn race  <dig>  among the six rlk genes, glyma16g <dig>  was found to accumulate transcripts in the scn resistance cultivar 'l-10' but not in 'heinong 37'. the transcript abundance was higher in root than in leaf for 'l-10', suggesting that the gene might play a role in the scn resistance to race  <dig> and race  <dig>
