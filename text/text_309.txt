BACKGROUND
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , or prion diseases, are infectious fatal disorders of the central nervous system  which include creutzfeldt-jakob disease, gerstmann-sträussler-scheincker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, scrapie in sheep, and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk  <cit> . they are associated with the accumulation of an oligomeric conformational scrapie isomer, prpsc, of the host-encoded monomeric prion protein prpc  <cit> . according to the "protein only" hypothesis, prpsc is the sole component of transmissible prions  <cit> . one of the main supports for this hypothesis is the finding that prp knockout  mice are completely protected against scrapie disease and fail to propagate prions  <cit>  and that introduction of murine prnp transgenes into these mice restores the susceptibility to prions  <cit> . the formation of prpsc involves a conformational switch by which prpc is transformed into the prpsc conformation with prpsc as template  <cit> . recently legname et al. succeeded in their attempt to form infectious prpsc from recombinant prpc without the use of infectious material, which strongly supports the "protein only" hypothesis  <cit> . puzzling to this hypothesis is the existence of a wide variety of distinct so-called prion strains with differing infectivity and related to them the mechanism of the species barrier, i.e., the degree of the interspecies infectivity of a prion strain  <cit> . primarily, the differences in prpsc amino acid sequence related to heterology of the prp genotype may account for the formation of distinct prion strains and for the species barrier  <cit> . for this reason hamster prions are usually not infectious to wild-type mice and there is a moderate species barrier for transmission of mouse prions to hamster. however, formation of distinct prion strains is even known, when the strains have identical primary structure and the hosts are genetically identical  <cit> . in this sense a recent article of the prusiner group  <cit>  provides evidence that prpsc conformation and species barrier may be independent of the infectious isomer and the degree of homology between the prp of the donor and that of the host. the species barrier should better be defined as the inability of the host to replicate the conformation of the infectious isomer and is broken only by altering the original and generating a conformational distinct isoform  <cit> . the fact that prion strains are encoded in the conformation of the protein has recently been proven for yeast prions  <cit> . several lines of evidence suggest that this is also true for mammalian prp, as reviewed by chien et al.  <cit> . more recently vanik et al.  <cit>  showed that sequence-based barriers that prevent cross-seeding between prion proteins from different species can be bypassed in vitro by a template-induced adaptation process leading to the emergence of new strains of prion fibrils. structural work should elucidate and identify the properties that determine the species barrier and the reproducibility or lack of reproducibility of a prion strain in a given host.

structures of the cellular prion proteins from different species are known, among these hamster  <cit> , human  <cit>  and bovine  <cit> . acidic ph can induce a scrapie-like unfolding intermediate of the prion protein  <cit>  and was shown to convert the human prion protein reversibly between native monomeric and fibrilogenic conformations  <cit> . the application of hydrostatic pressure is known to stabilize folding intermediates and was applied to the study of aggregates and amyloids  <cit> . recently a number of groups performed high pressure experiments on mammalian prion protein  <cit> . the combination of high hydrostatic pressure with high resolution nmr spectroscopy allows the observation of pressure induced structural changes and shifts of conformational equilibria as well as local instabilities of the protein at atomic resolution. kuwata et al.  <cit>  used high pressure nmr spectroscopy to stabilize a locally disordered conformer of the hamster prion protein.

here we report results from high pressure nmr spectroscopy on two isoforms of the human prion protein, huprp and huprp, at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> k in the pressure range from  <dig>  to  <dig> mpa. the application of pressure potentially allows detecting structural intermediates of prp which may be important for the transformation process between cellular and infectious scrapie-type protein.

RESULTS
general pressure effects on full length and truncated human prion protein
1d 1h- and 2d 1h-15n-trosy nmr spectra of two different constructs of the 15n enriched human prion protein, huprp and huprp, were recorded at ph  <dig>   at various pressures. we used solution conditions identical to those used for the structure determination  <cit> . particularly for huprp slightly acidic ph is necessary because the protein aggregates at neutral ph  <cit> . the shorter construct huprp contains essentially the c-terminal folded part of the protein, the longer construct huprp in addition the unfolded n-terminus of the prion protein. under theses conditions they showed nearly identical and completely reversible pressure responses in the range from  <dig>  to  <dig> mpa. at  <dig> k we applied hydrostatic pressures in steps of  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mpa to both, huprp and huprp. increasing pressure results in chemical shift changes of all resonances. in addition, in the trosy-hsqc spectra the increased pressure leads to a decrease of the signal volumes of a number of resonances. some of the signals disappear completely from the spectra while others show no significant volume change as described below .

pressure dependence of the chemical shifts in the truncated and full length prion protein
in general, the pressure response of proteins is anisotropic and the chemical shift changes induced by the local and global conformational changes are a non-linear function of the pressure. traditionally, the pressure dependence is described by the zero-order coefficient δ <dig>  the first order coefficient b <dig> and the second order coefficient b <dig> of a taylor expansion around the pressure p <dig> and the temperature t <dig> . when the pressure effects are assumed to be composed of two contributions, an unspecific effect as observed in random-coil peptides and a specific, structure dependent effect, then the influence of these effects on the taylor coefficients can be assumed as additive as long as the two events are not or only weekly coupled . in this case, the corrected, conformation dependent pressure  coefficients b1* and b2* can be obtained by subtracting the corresponding pressure coefficients from random-coil peptides. random-coil pressure coefficients are available for the 1h-shifts from a study of the model peptides gly-gly-x-ala peptides  <cit>  but not for the 15n-shifts.

the first order conformation dependent pressure |b1*| for the 1hn shifts and of the uncorrected pressure coefficient |b1| of the 15nh chemical shift as a function of the primary and the secondary structure are displayed in fig.  <dig> for the full length protein huprp. analogously, the second order coefficients |b2*| and |b2| are plotted as a function of the sequence position in fig.  <dig>  the mean first and second order pressure coefficients |b1*|, |b1|, |b2*|, and |b2| are  <dig>  ppm/gpa,  <dig>  ppm/gpa,  <dig>  ppm/gpa <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm/gpa <dig> 

a similar shift pattern is obtained for the truncated prion protein  in the regions which are common to both proteins. however, the mean first and second order pressure coefficients |b1*|, |b1|, |b2*|, and |b2| are with  <dig>  ppm/gpa,  <dig>  ppm/gpa,  <dig>  ppm/gpa <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm/gpa <dig> significantly larger than in the full length protein. this is different when corresponding regions are compared since the pressure effects are much smaller in unfolded regions of the protein which contribute much more to the mean values in the full length protein. for the folded part of the full length protein one obtains mean values for <|b1*|>, <|b1|>, <|b2*|>, and <|b2|>  <dig>  ppm/gpa,  <dig>  ppm/gpa,  <dig>  ppm/gpa <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm/gpa <dig>  respectively.

if one takes the region common in the two proteins then the averages of the pressure coefficients are almost identical, that is the n-terminus does not significantly influence the average pressure response of the folded part. the correlation coefficient for the first order proton and nitrogen coefficients b1* and b <dig> of the two proteins is  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, indicating also a quantitative agreement of the parameters in the two proteins. for the correlation coefficients of, b2*, and b <dig> one obtains with  <dig>  and  <dig>  smaller correlations in the two proteins. this is mainly due to the relatively large errors involved in the calculation of the taylor pressure coefficients. in contrast, the direct correlation of the experimental chemical shift changes Δδ  is much higher. the mean value of these correlation coefficients for each residue of huprp to its corresponding residue in huprp is  <dig>  for the amide protons and  <dig>  for the amide nitrogen atoms.

although the general pressure response of the folded core is very similar in the full length and the truncated huprp there are some residues where clearly different responses can be observed . the chemical shift differences already existing for glu <dig>  his <dig>  thr <dig>  glu <dig>  glu <dig> and tyr <dig> at ambient pressure become larger with increasing pressure.

in the structured core  of full length and truncated huprp most residues shift with increasing pressure . for identifying residues that behave differently to the majority of the peaks one can select those which display first or second order pressure coefficients which are larger or smaller than the average by a standard deviation . since large chemical shift changes are strongly correlated with large conformational changes, residues with pressure coefficients larger than average plus one sd are most probably involved in strong conformational changes. accordingly, residues with pressure coefficients smaller than average minus one sd represent regions of small inferred conformational changes. the residues m <dig>  f <dig>  q <dig>  h <dig>  t <dig>  v <dig>  k <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  v <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig> and r <dig> display first order pressure coefficients |b1*| and g <dig>  i <dig>  h <dig>  c <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  k <dig>  g <dig>  n <dig>  f <dig>  t <dig>  d <dig> and m <dig> |b1| which are significantly larger than the average in this region  for huprp. the largest pressure induced chemical shift changes of amide proton resonances are observed in the loop between strand β <dig>  and helix α <dig> , in the loop connecting helix α <dig>  and α <dig> , as well as in regions of helix α <dig> and α <dig>  generally, the differences of the pressure dependence of the chemical shifts along the protein sequence are much less pronounced for the amide nitrogen atoms than for the amide protons. the pressure-sensitive regions for both, 1hn and 15nh, overlap quite well but not completely. almost the same residues are also identified by the second order coefficients. the same is true for the residues with a very small pressure response, namely  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> | smaller than the mean value minus one sigma) and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> | smaller than the mean value minus  <dig>  sigma) in case of huprp. as has been stated above and has been quantified by the correlation analysis the pressure response of the amide nitrogen atoms of residues 121– <dig> of huprp is very similar to that of huprp. in conclusion, huprp is a good model for the study of pressure effects on the structured core of the whole protein.

the n-terminal part of the protein  is assumed to be unstructured and thus should show only small pressure effects . this is in general true, the mean first and second order pressure coefficients |b1*|, |b1|, |b2*|, and |b2| are with  <dig>  ppm/gpa,  <dig>  ppm/gpa,  <dig>  ppm/gpa <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm/gpa <dig> significantly smaller than in the folded part of the protein. however, a number of residues show pressure coefficients that are above the average. surprisingly, this is also true for the amide proton shifts, where the pressure coefficients of random coil peptides  <cit>  were subtracted. notably, k <dig>  s <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  k <dig>  s <dig>  k <dig> and m <dig> show linear pressure coefficients that deviate significantly from the expectation. for the quadratic coefficients this applies to g <dig>  s <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  n <dig> and m <dig>  if the n-terminus would be completely unstructured, only pressure coefficients in the magnitude of the random coil peptide values would be expected.

pressure response of chemical shifts and related gibbs free energies
some of the residues show strong non-linear pressure dependences of the chemical shifts together with an asymptotic behavior within the pressure range studied  which would be typical for a two-state transition in fast exchange on the nmr-time scale. in this model, at ambient pressure two local conformational states n <dig> and n <dig> coexist that are sensed by the corresponding residues. at high pressure the local conformational equilibrium of the protein is completely shifted from the ground state to the low-lying excited state n <dig>  the molar free energy  for this local transition can be derived from the chemical shift change by equation  . as already discussed above for removing unspecific pressure effects from specific conformation dependent effects, prior to the calculation of the gibbs free energies Δg <dig> the pressure-induced chemical shift change as determined for the random coil standard peptides  <cit>  was subtracted from the measured chemical shift values. since that was only possible for the proton shifts only these were evaluated quantitatively. however, qualitatively the pressure dependence of the nitrogen chemical shifts followed the same rules.

for the residues of the structured core ) one obtains  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kj/mol. the Δg <dig> value for the pressure-induced transition of the n-terminal residues of huprp is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kj/mol . at ambient pressure about 71% of the protein are in the highest populated native "ground state" conformation, whereas 29% are in the second "excited" native conformation which is favored by applying pressure. from the fast exchange condition, a lower limit for the exchange correlation rate 1/τe of  <dig> s- <dig> can be estimated for the n1-n <dig> transition.

pressure response of cross peak volumes and the related gibbs free energies
at  <dig> mpa the amide proton resonances of residues y <dig>  g <dig>  m <dig>  r <dig>  i <dig>  f <dig>  g <dig>  s <dig>  d <dig>  y <dig>  r <dig>  q <dig>  v <dig>  y <dig>  n <dig>  d <dig>  i <dig>  t <dig>  e <dig>  d <dig>  v <dig>  c <dig>  i <dig>  q <dig> and e <dig> are not observable in case of huprp. especially, the cross peak of gly <dig> disappears already at  <dig> mpa, while residues ile <dig>  phe <dig>  gln <dig>  val <dig>  tyr <dig> and asp <dig> become undetectable at  <dig> mpa. these residues mainly cluster to the loop between the strand β <dig> and helix α <dig>  near helix α <dig> and close to the β-sheet. in case of huprp qualitatively the same process can be observed for the core region, however, since in the longer construct the resolution is reduced and becomes worse with increasing pressure only the disappearance of residues gly <dig>  ile <dig>  phe <dig>  arg <dig> and asp <dig> can be reliably confirmed. the n-terminal unstructured region displays a less pronounced chemical shift dependence and no significant volume change upon pressure . by releasing the pressure we observe the original spectra at ambient pressure again, thus the pressure-induced changes are completely reversible.

there are two possible explanations for this loss in intensity, increased loss of intensity during the inept-periods by increased average t2-relaxation and/or a two site exchange which is slow on the nmr-time scale and where the second signal would be too weak to be observable  <cit> . the increased transverse relaxation rate could be due to an exchange broadening or an increased effective molecular size by protein aggregation. the last mechanism could also lead to a disappearance of the second signal in the slow exchange regime. under fast exchange conditions the increased transverse relaxation time can also be estimated from the broadening of the signals by pressure. the observed increase in line width by a factor  <dig>  to  <dig> is too small to account for the observed loss in signal intensities if fast exchange conditions would prevail. using the approximations derived by maurer et al.  <cit>  a maximum intensity decrease by 20% could follow from that additional, pressure dependent line broadening. for most of the residues under consideration the intensity loss during the polarization transfer process is considerably smaller, thus pointing towards a slow exchange process with an intermediate conformation. a line broadening of the same magnitude as observed for the amide groups is also observed in 1d-spectra for resonances of non-exchangeable protons. as an example the high-field shifted methyl resonances of leu <dig>  leu <dig>  ile <dig> and ile <dig> are shown in fig.  <dig>  as seen in the trosy spectra, in the 1d spectra a certain number of peaks shows no or only weak line broadening, too. the line broadening is not caused by a change of the viscosity of water with pressure, since at  <dig> k the water viscosity shows only weak pressure dependence up to pressures above  <dig> mpa. actually the viscosity even decreases till  <dig> mpa to about 98% and displays a moderate increase with increasing pressure above that. at about  <dig> mpa it reaches its original value again  <cit> . thus, the origin of the line broadening might be due to conformational heterogeneity and/or exchange.

assuming two site model under slow exchange conditions the pressure induced changes of volumes and thus of the corresponding populations can be used to calculate a molar free energy  for every single amino acid residue in the polypeptide chain. the equilibrium constant k between the native state and the pressure populated intermediate can then be derived from the ratio of the peak volumes . fig. 5c shows the molar free energies at ambient pressure obtained from a fit of the data as a function of the primary structure of huprp. the secondary structure elements are indicated at the bottom. due to signal overlap it was not possible to determine exact values for the cross peak intensities of every residue which leads to gaps in the residue specific determination of the pressure stability . residues which show no significant change of the signal intensity are marked with "#". the average for the molar free energies Δg <dig> and their standard deviations are indicated in fig. 5c by a solid and two broken lines. the mean of Δg <dig> is  <dig>  kj/mol with a standard deviation of  <dig>  kj/mol. the distribution of free energies is depicted in fig. 7a showing that the obtained energy distribution is clearly divided into two groups. fig. 7b shows peak volumes and the Δg fit of typical residues of both groups. in fig.  <dig> the two groups are mapped on the structure of huprp. group one encompasses  <dig> residues and has a Δg <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kj/mol, the mean Δg0of the  <dig> residues of group two is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kj/mol.

characterization of the folding intermediates
the pressure response of huprp consists of three different effects:  <cit>  small linear chemical shift changes corresponding to small first-order pressure coefficients,  <cit>  non-linear chemical shift changes which show for some residues a typical asymptotic behavior as it would be expected for a fast exchange between slightly differing conformations, and  <cit>  a loss of signal volumes which occurs for the majority of the amino acid residues. a thorough analysis shows the appearance of at least two different conformational transitions between the ground state n <dig>  the low-lying excited state n <dig> and the intermediate states  <cit> . at ambient pressure the chemical shift data allow us to postulate the states n <dig> and n <dig>  and the analysis of the signal volume loss induced by pressure indicates additional intermediate states i <dig> and i <dig>  strong pressure responses are often associated with the existence of packing defects, or cavities in the direct neighborhood. the cavities calculated from the pdb deposited structure  are also shown in fig.  <dig>  the found cavity at this position is surrounded by acidic side chains thus leading to a hydrophilic pore. close to helices α <dig> and α <dig> similar packing defects are also seen.

the pressure dependent energy landscape of the human prion protein is shown in fig.  <dig> schematically. at ambient pressure two native states n <dig> and n <dig> as well as the energetic unfavorable excited intermediate states i <dig> and i <dig> are visible. with increasing pressure the energy profile changes. at the onset of pressure n <dig> becomes the energetically lowest and therefore highest populated conformation. at very high pressures the intermediate conformations i <dig> and i <dig> are strongly favored.

discussion
a key point of the prion only hypothesis has been finally proven by different groups  <cit>  showing that it is possible to produce in vitro conformations of the prion protein which can confer infectivity. this conformation is generated by a seeding process which is so potent, that even sequence-based barriers that prevent cross-seeding between prion proteins from different species can be bypassed in vitro. such a template-induced adaptation process is leading then to the emergence of new strains of prion fibrils  <cit> . it is obvious, that the pathway of prion protein assembly into amyloid and possibly into infectious protein implies a whole variety of subconformations and is extremely complex  <cit> .

the investigation of multiple misfolding pathways of the prion protein is indispensable to pinpoint down the regions involved in the protein conversion from prpc to prpsc. folding or unfolding intermediates are usually created by use of denaturing agents. an elegant alternative to this is the application of hydrostatic pressure which allows to stabilize and study intermediate forms in the folding pathway of prp  <cit> . pressure can also induce scrapie-like prion protein misfolding and amyloid fibril formation as has been shown by lange and co-workers  <cit> . torrent et al.  <cit>  showed an irreversible aggregation of syrian hamster prion protein shaprp above  <dig> mpa, and incubation of shaprp at  <dig> mpa overnight led to the formation of amyloid fibrils, whereas pressures up to  <dig> mpa led to reversible effects and recovery of the original structure after pressure release  <cit> . nmr spectroscopy is the only generally applicable method to monitor pressure-induced structural changes at the atomic level in solution. our current setup allows us to monitor such changes between  <dig>  and  <dig> mpa. here all pressure-induced structural changes were reversible as also be observed by nmr in the hamster prion protein  <cit> . however, a detailed comparison at an atom to atom level with our data is not possible since kuwata et al. used a less sophisticated evaluation method, especially in that study it was not investigated if the native and intermediate state can be differentiated in substates with different free energies.

conformational states in proteins detected by variation of pressure
application of equations  to  allows the calculation of individual Δg <dig> and Δv values for all atoms in the molecule. when more than one parameter can be used as in our case the chemical shift change and the peak volume change more than one Δg <dig> and Δv value can be calculated for the structural transition observed by a single amide group in the protein. the question arises what the physical meaning of these values may be. in principle, Δg <dig> and Δv are global quantities that describe the difference of the gibbs free energies and partial volumes of a state xi to an arbitrary state x <dig> of the system. since the number of possible states of the system  is infinite one has to restrict to a smaller number of global states for obtaining meaningful results. in general one can separate the states of the bulk water from the rest of the system. since pressure influences strongly the water shell close to the protein the effects on the shell and the protein conformation itself are difficult to separate.

our analysis of n amide cross peak volumes and 2n pressure induced 1h and 15n chemical shift changes gives us information about 6n different conformational states when the individual parameters follow a two-site exchange model. in case of multiple site exchange even more states would be expected. the primary evaluation of our shift and volume changes is done in this way. the same has been done by kuwata et al. for the hamster prion protein but only volume changes were taken into account  <cit> .

however, the structural substates in a protein-water system are usually coupled; the obtained atom specific Δg <dig> and Δv values are in general not to be interpreted locally since large contributions are due to structural differences of other parts of the molecule compared to the ground state . as a further complication the calculation of the differences as done here must not necessarily refer to the same ground state.

after correction for unspecific "random coil" pressure induced shifts, we can group the Δg <dig> and Δv values in four main classes. this means in a minimal description of the system the substates xi are reduced to the combination of two "native" states n <dig> and n <dig> and two "intermediate" states i <dig> and i <dig>  these states are primarily defined in the data evaluation as localized structural states and no information is available about the structural states of not directly considered other parts of the protein. especially, in the data evaluation of the signal volume changes defining the intermediate states a localized native structural state has to be assumed. since for some of the residues undergoing volume changes also shift changes corresponding to the n <dig> to n <dig> transition are observed, it seems plausible to assume that this transition is independent of the intermediate states and occurs in the whole protein. the calculated Δg <dig> values then would refer to a state n where the other parts of the molecules are in the structural state n <dig> or n <dig>  the simplest picture would assume an ordered reaction scheme of conformational states s.

n <dig> ⇆ n <dig> ⇆ i <dig> ⇆ i2

the quality of the data does not allow distinguishing between this model and more complicated possible models. the corresponding energy surface has been depicted schematically in fig.  <dig>  the abscissa here is a generalized arbitrary coordinate which represents the structural states of the proteins only schematically.

since the data can be explained sufficiently well with four states only, we restrict in the following discussion on the existence of these four states. however, we cannot exclude the existence of additional structural states with indistinguishable free energies. the pressure dependences of the chemical shifts indicate the existence of a second native conformation of huprp, which is favored under high pressure and is in fast conformational exchange with the "ground state". at ambient pressure 71% of the protein is in the main native state n <dig> and 29% are in the "excited" native conformation n <dig>  the low energy difference  and the relatively small chemical shift differences between n <dig> and n <dig> implies, that only slight structural changes occur in the n <dig> ↔ n <dig> transition. the state i <dig> and i <dig> are derived from the analysis of the volume changes of those resonances that are too broad to be observable in one of the states i. at ambient pressures only less than 1% exists in i <dig> or i <dig>  at  <dig> mpa most of the protein is in state i <dig> or i <dig> 

structural changes under high pressure
the n-terminal region of huprp is known to show no well-defined three-dimensional structure at the used buffer conditions. an analysis of the chemical shifts corrected for neighbor effects  <cit>  indicates no well-defined regions where secondary structure is induced by pressure. nevertheless, the complete n-terminus has a tendency towards positive chemical shift values.

after subtracting the random-coil pressure coefficients within the limits of error vanishing first and second order pressure coefficients are expected for those parts of the structure that are in a random-coil conformation. unfortunately, random-coil values do only exist for protons  <cit>  but not for 15n. therefore, only the proton shifts can be interpreted in detail. in the presumably unstructured part  the expectation values of b1* and b2* are with  <dig>  ppm/gpa and  <dig>  ppm/gpa <dig> close to zero . most interestingly, the range of amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> where two-dimensional electron crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations  <cit>  predict β-sheet formation after polymerization displays a high variety of pressure sensitivity. the strands β <dig> and β <dig> seem to be very insensitive to the application of high pressure while the loop and the helix α <dig> in between these two strands exhibit some of the most pronounced changes in structure we observed by applying high pressure.

as indicated by the pressure induced chemical shift changes there are two native conformations n <dig> and n <dig> in fast conformational exchange, which coexist even at ambient pressure. the relatively small difference of the molar free enthalpies of both states as well as the rather small chemical shift changes indicate, that the n <dig> ↔ n <dig> transition is only associated with a small structural rearrangement. especially the very small chemical shift differences show that n <dig> and n <dig> adopt very similar structures. unfortunately, a complete structural characterization of n <dig> cannot be performed by the available data.

the pressure dependent reduction of cross peak volumes in the trosy-hsqc-spectra was associated with the n ↔ i transition. they can be due to increased t2-losses during the inept polarization transfer periods and/or a slow exchange process where the resonances of state i are broadened beyond detection  <cit> . in principle mainly two mechanisms can be responsible for an increased t <dig>  an increase of the rotational correlation time by protein-protein interaction and exchange broadening. in one-dimensional proton nmr spectra we observe a nearly general line broadening of approximately a factor two which could indicate a formation of dimers at higher pressure. in the trosy-hsqc spectra also an additional line broadening with pressure is observed which varies locally but is clearly smaller than the factor of two. additional line broadenings in the trosy-spectra are mainly associated with chemical exchange processes. the observed increase of the transverse relaxation rates cannot explain the observed reduction of cross peak volumes as the only factor . therefore, as additional factor a reduction of the peak volume by a slow exchange process is required as it has been done also for the hamster prion protein by kuwata et al.  <cit> . in the absence of exchange broadening the cross peak volume change with pressure can be described by equations  and . in the presence of a moderate additional exchange these equations still provide a good approximation but the presence of exchange broadening would lead to too large estimates of the apparent Δg <dig> values.

within the limits of error the cross peak volume changes can be associated with two folding intermediates. in the folded core of the prion protein the region around positions ile <dig>  his <dig>  and phe <dig> shows rather low Δg <dig> values that may indicate a larger exchange contribution. this may be interpreted as a premature local melting which correlates with a packing defect in this region . a non-perfect stacking of side-chain and main-chain atoms leads to a less restricted peptide main chain in this area allowing a high degree of conformational freedom and thus conformational variability/heterogeneity. as pointed out by pratt and co-workers  <cit>  and has been observed experimentally by high-pressure nmr spectroscopy on ralgds by us  <cit> , pressure-induced unfolding is caused by the penetration of water into the hydrophobic core due to the dissociation of electrostatic bonds and solvation of hydrophobic residues. the sidechain resonance of the ile <dig> methyl proton exhibits the most pronounced up field shift observed in the human prion protein indicating a strong interaction with the hydrophobic core of this protein.

single low Δg <dig> values are also found in the helical region encompassing α <dig> and α <dig> which is in agreement with the finding that helices are more prone to pressure than extended structures like β-strands. in a similar study kuwata et al.  <cit>  investigated in a high-pressure nmr study the syrian hamster shaprp. they found the most pronounced effects in the helical region encompassing the helices α <dig> and α <dig> implying a complete unfolding of these two helices in a slow exchange process. in addition, our data show the occurrence of a pressure-stabilized "excited" state n <dig>  the existence of that state was not taken into account in their data analysis. subsequently we find a slow exchange process to two intermediate conformations, which are characterized by a melting of the region around ile139-phe <dig> and a partial melting of the helical region encompassing α <dig> and α <dig>  our data suggest a dual mechanism for the structural changes under pressure at least in the human prion protein. especially the observation in intermediate i <dig> that the most stable region of the human prion protein is localized in the region of the two helices where the disulfide bridge is located corresponds very well with the hydrogen protection measurements by other groups  <cit> .

vanik et al.  <cit>  adopted the y <dig> stop variant for in vitro specific seeding of amyloid fibrils. in particular, they found that mouse or hamster prp-specific amino acid substitutions at position  <dig> and  <dig> are sufficient to change essential amyloidogenic properties of huprp, with the mutant proteins adopting seeding specificities of prp corresponding to different species. vice versa, m138i/m139i shaprp adopted the properties of human prp  <cit> . our results show that the importance of individual amino acids in prp as determinants of the species barriers are due to their local conformational variability which can be highlighted by applying high pressure and monitored on an atomic scale through nmr spectroscopy. especially, local clusters of very low stability found in our experiments are prone to change their conformation upon interaction with the infectious conformer prpsc. indeed, permissible first entry-points of the scrapie isomer need a certain degree of local conformational freedom to initiate the refolding of the cellular isomer to an infectious one. thus, the species and transmission barrier is conserved through the differences in the conformational freedom of local areas in the protein structure which can vary substantially with differing solution conditions necessary for the proteolytic degradation of proteins in the cell.

structural states of n-terminal parts of the huprp
the n-terminal part of huprp exhibits regions with chemical shift responses that are not typical for random-coil peptides. their first and/or second order pressure coefficients deviate significantly from the average . this is best visible for the proton shift coefficients since they could be corrected by subtracting the published random-coil values  <cit> . one can define four regions where at least one of the coefficients deviates significantly from the average, namely region a encompassing k <dig>  region b encompassing g <dig>  s <dig> and g <dig>  region c encompassing g <dig> and g <dig> and region d with k <dig>  s <dig>  k <dig>  n <dig> and m <dig>  the data indicate that these regions have a non-random population of structural states that coexist in solution and show a characteristic change of populations with pressure. region c is located within the three octapeptide repeats which are known to adopt a defined structure upon binding of copper  <cit> . unfortunately, the amino acids of the three octapeptide repeats could not be resolved individually in the spectra. they seem to have a similar pressure response, too. region d is in the region kuwata et al. previously discussed the existence of transient helices  <cit> . this is in good agreement with our observations of pressure responses typical for structured proteins. interestingly, there is an overlap between region b and c of the pressure-sensible residues and a possible ph-dependent aggregation site  as described by ralph zahn  <cit> . the observed pressure-sensitivity emphasizes the importance of this region.

the probability that some residues of the unfolded part of prp are in the time average in contact with the surface of the folded part is quite high and was discussed by zahn et al.  <cit> . if this would be true it could also influence the pressure response of the folded core in full length prp. indeed, such a differential response is observed clearly for glu <dig>  his <dig>  thr <dig>  glu <dig>  glu <dig> and tyr <dig>  they show also different chemical shifts in truncated and full length prp. from cα chemical shift differences in the full length and the truncated prp zahn et al.  <cit>  identified as possible interaction regions his <dig> to thr <dig> and glu <dig> to tyr <dig>  the differences in the pressure response observed may indicate a transient interaction between the region d that is closest in sequence to the core and the surface around amino acids mentioned above.

CONCLUSIONS
high-pressure nmr spectroscopy indicates that the folded core of the human prion protein occurs in two structural states n <dig> and n <dig> in solution associated with rather small differences in free enthalpies . at atmospheric pressure approximately 29% of the protein are already in the pressure favored conformation n <dig>  there is a second process representing two possible folding intermediates i <dig> and i <dig> with average free enthalpy differences of  <dig>  kj/mol and  <dig>  kj/mol respectively, which could represent a preaggregation state of the protein. freezing out of such subpopulations by fixing them, e.g. with antibodies added or co-expressed in transgenic animals  <cit> , has led to animal strains resistant against the development of prionosis. in this sense such local areas of high conformational variability/heterogeneity highlighted through high pressure nmr spectroscopy are indeed a first drug target for preventing the conversion into toxic intermediates able to transform into amyloid fibrils.
