BACKGROUND
the cellular components and processes that specify nuclear size, shape and internal organization are poorly understood, particularly in flowering plants. despite similarities at the gross morphological level among all eukaryotic nuclei, such as a double-membrane boundary perforated with nuclear pores, most of the proteins known to affect nuclear structure in animals are not evolutionarily conserved and are consequently difficult to recognize or absent entirely in plant proteomes  <cit> . these observations indicate that the machinery, and perhaps the principles, specifying nuclear organization in flowering plants are distinct from those operating in animals and represent a convergent evolutionary path to a canonical nuclear organization in eukaryotic cells  <cit> .

we demonstrated previously  <cit>  that two paralogous arabidopsis coiled-coil proteins, originally named little nuclei  <dig> and  <dig> , play important roles in specifying nuclear shape and size. supporting this conclusion, sakamoto and takagi recently reported that disruption of linc <dig>  another of the four paralogous genes in this family, leads to reduced nuclear size and loss of elongated nuclear shape in differentiated cells, mirroring the phenotype of linc <dig> mutants  <cit> . these proteins are closely related to nmcp <dig>  nuclear matrix constituent protein  <dig>  originally identified as a protein residing on the periphery of carrot nuclei and a component of the salt-resistant nuclear matrix  <cit> . although nmcp <dig> and related proteins are plant-specific and share no significant amino acid similarity to lamins, their tripartite structure with an extensive central coiled-coil domain and their localization at the nuclear periphery suggest that nmcp1-related plant proteins might be functional analogs of this core component of the animal nuclear lamina  <cit> . more recent computational analysis  <cit> , however, has suggested that the nmcp class of plant proteins shares more structural similarities to myosins or paramyosins than to lamins.

here, we extend our reverse genetic analysis to encompass all four members of the arabidopsis nmcp-related protein family, which we have renamed crwn  to avoid confusion with the acronym linc  that refers to sun-kash protein linkages that bridge the inner and outer nuclear membrane  <cit> . our findings demonstrate that crwn proteins are essential for viability, and our analyses uncover complex functional diversification among crwn proteins with regards to their effects on whole-plant morphology, nuclear size, and the spatial organization of constitutive heterochromatin aggregates  in interphase nuclei. we found that crwn <dig> plays the most prominent role among crwn paralogs in controlling nuclear size, while crwn <dig> has the most important role in controlling the distribution and number of heterochromatic chromocenters. the reduced nuclear size in crwn mutants is not matched by a commensurate reduction in endopolyploid levels, resulting in increased nuclear dna densities  up to four-fold higher than wild type levels.

RESULTS
we performed a phylogenetic analysis of arabidopsis crwn proteins and their homologues in other species to begin our investigation of the potential diversification within this family. the predicted arabidopsis proteome contains four closely related crwn proteins  that share 30-40% amino acid identity; no other arabidopsis proteins with extended regions of significant amino acid identity to crwn proteins were found. similar proteins were found in other plant species, but interestingly, no fungi or animal crwn homologues were identified from searches of protein databases. in addition, crwn homologues were absent in the predicted proteome of the green algae chlamydomonas and volvox.

we constructed a phylogram of crwn proteins and related plant homologs using a maximum likelihood algorithm . the tree features two major clades distinct from crwn homologues in two basal plants, selaginella moellendorffii and physcomitrella patens. one clade includes three of the arabidopsis paralogs, crwn <dig>  crwn <dig> and crwn <dig>  while crwn <dig> belongs to the other clade. within each clade, the monocot proteins, represented by maize, sorghum and rice, group independently from the dicot proteins. only two crwn paralogs exist in these monocots – one crwn1-like and one crwn4-like. however, certain dicot species, such as arabidopsis, poplar, grape, and castor bean, contain multiple copies of crwn1-like proteins. the dicot crwn4-like proteins are also distinct from their monocot counterparts in lacking a conserved amino acid motif at the extreme c-terminus .

genetic redundancy in the crwn family
the inference that crwn <dig> and related proteins are divergent from members of the crwn1-containing clade was supported by genetic analyses to dissect the functions of the crwn paralogs. we used agrobacterium t-dna insertion alleles to study the effects of inactivating different combinations of crwn genes  <cit> . previously, we demonstrated that the crwn1- <dig> and crwn2-1 t-dna alleles severely reduce or eliminate transcription downstream of the t-dna insertion  <cit> . here, we performed transcript analysis by rt-pcr for the crwn3- <dig> and crwn4- <dig> alleles used in this study . for crwn3- <dig>  some transcript was detected downstream of the insertion; however, no transcript could be detected using primers that flanked the insertion. the crwn4- <dig> insertion blocked transcription downstream of the t-dna. the lack of full-length crwn transcripts from homozygous mutant lines indicates that all four mutations used in this study are likely to be loss-of-function alleles. we note that the crwn genes have similar developmental gene expression patterns: the steady-state abundance of transcripts for all four paralogs peak in proliferating tissues   <cit> .

mutant plants carrying single insertions were intercrossed and progeny carrying homozygous insertions in different combinations were recovered. figure  <dig> shows the whole-plant phenotype of the viable mutants at the rosette stage just after the transition to flowering. plants carrying a mutation in any single crwn gene had phenotypes similar to wild-type columbia plants, as did the double crwn <dig> crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> crwn <dig> mutants. the crwn <dig> crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> crwn <dig> double mutants exhibited slightly smaller rosettes, while the remaining double mutants, crwn <dig> crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> crwn <dig>  displayed markedly smaller rosette sizes. we were able to recover only two of the four triple mutants - crwn <dig> crwn <dig> crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> crwn <dig> crwn <dig>  both of which were extremely stunted and set few seed.

our inability to isolate a mutant combining alleles in all four crwn genes indicates that at least one functional crwn protein is required for viability. triple mutant plants carrying only crwn <dig> or crwn <dig> were extremely stunted, but still viable. this result suggests that crwn <dig> or crwn <dig> alone can cover the minimum requirements for the entire crwn protein family. however, plants carrying only crwn <dig> or only crwn <dig> were not recovered, suggesting that crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> are specialized and that neither protein alone can express the full range of functions of the crwn protein family.

crwn proteins are required to maintain proper nuclear size and shape
we next observed crwn mutant nuclei from adult leaf tissue to determine the role of different crwn proteins in specifying nuclear size and shape. among the single mutants, a deficiency of crwn <dig> or crwn <dig> reduced nuclear size , while loss of crwn <dig> or crwn <dig> had no effect. combining a crwn <dig> mutation with a crwn <dig> or crwn <dig> mutation had a synergistic effect on nuclear size, suggesting that crwn <dig> function overlaps, at least partially, with those of crwn <dig> and crwn <dig>  double mutant combinations containing crwn <dig> and either crwn <dig> or crwn <dig> did not show additive phenotypes but rather resembled crwn <dig>  in contrast, combination of a crwn <dig> with a crwn <dig> mutation had an additive effect on nuclear size. these findings indicate that crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> are the major determinants of nuclear size among the crwn paralogs. further, the additive effects of crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> mutations suggest crwn <dig> acts independently from crwn <dig>  consistent with their distinct phylogenetic grouping  and the genetic analysis shown in figure  <dig> 

crwn proteins are required for development or maintenance of the elongated spindle shapes which characterize larger nuclei in differentiated wild-type cells  <cit> . we previously reported that a deficiency of crwn <dig> causes nuclei in all cells to adopt the spherical shape characteristic of proliferating tissue at root and shoot apices  <cit> . the present study confirmed the importance of crwn <dig> for nuclear shape differentiation and also uncovered a similar role for crwn <dig> , a conclusion also reached recently by sakamoto and takagi  <cit> . nuclei from crwn <dig> leaf tissue often have irregular margins and are more spherically shaped, compared to wild-type nuclei . however, crwn <dig> nuclei are less uniformly round in comparison to crwn <dig> nuclei, particularly larger crwn <dig> nuclei. further, crwn <dig> nuclei occasionally contain thin projections that appear to be drawn from the nuclear surface .

loss of crwn proteins affects nuclear dna packing density
the direct correlation between endopolyploidy and nuclear size in wild-type arabidopsis cells  <cit>  prompted us to examine this relationship within the crwn mutants. we measured the average endopolyploidy level of nuclei from the same adult leaves harvested for the nuclear size analysis shown in figure 4a . some crwn mutants showed a decrease in endopolyploid levels, particularly the crwn triple mutants and the crwn <dig> crwn <dig> double mutant, but the remaining crwn genotypes had average endopolyploidy levels that approached wild-type levels . the dashed line in figure 4b depicts the expected nuclear size change in response to a reduction in endopolyploidy based on the established one-to-one relationship between nuclear volume  and dna content in wild type plants. with the exception of crwn <dig> and crwn <dig>  the crwn mutations caused a more pronounced reduction in nuclear size than predicted from the observed endopolyploidy level. as a consequence, crwn mutants display a spectrum of nuclear dna densities, ranging from wild-type values in crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> mutants to four-fold higher densities in crwn <dig> crwn <dig> double mutants and the two viable crwn triple mutants.

we then investigated the relationship between nuclear size and dna content by examining the effects of different crwn genotypes on nuclear size in leaf guard cells, a diploid cell type where endopolyploidy is not a factor  <cit> . crwn <dig> mutant guard cell nuclei were smaller than nuclei in wild type cells with an area approximately one-half of the wild type value, corresponding to a volume difference of approximately threefold assuming a roughly spherical shape to nuclei in the cell . double and triple mutants lacking crwn <dig> displayed nuclear sizes similar to the crwn <dig> single mutant. consistent with their effects on nuclear size shown in figure 4a, neither the crwn <dig> nor crwn <dig> mutation affected nuclear size in guard cells. interestingly, the size of nuclei in crwn <dig> guard cells was also unaffected, in contrast to the effect seen in a population of adult leaf cells . however, crwn <dig> crwn <dig>  crwn <dig> crwn <dig>  and crwn <dig> crwn <dig> double mutants had nuclei approximately 20% smaller than those seen in wild-type guard cells, suggesting some functional redundancy among crwn <dig>  crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> proteins. overall, our results indicate that crwn <dig> plays the major role in affecting nuclear size in the absence of changes in endopolyploidy.

crwn <dig> maintains interphase chromocenter integrity and organization
considering the dramatic effects of crwn mutations on nuclear size and morphology, we turned our attention to the role of crwn proteins on the internal organization of the nucleus. a conspicuous feature of arabidopsis interphase nuclei are discrete foci of heterochromatin, or chromocenters, visualized as bright spots after staining with fluorescent dna-intercalating dyes  <cit> . a typical interphase nucleus contains approximately ten chromocenters corresponding to the number of diploid chromosomes   <cit> . chromocenter number remains fairly constant over a wide range of nuclear sizes and endopolyploid levels , most likely as a result of lateral association of sister chromatids after endoreduplication  <cit> . we found that the average chromocenter number in crwn <dig>  crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> leaf cell nuclei was similar to that seen in wild-type leaf cell nuclei  and did not change dramatically as a function of nuclear size. in crwn <dig> nuclei, however, chromocenter number was strongly correlated with nuclear size : smaller nuclei contained fewer chromocenters than the wild-type value of ~ <dig>  while larger, presumably endopolyploid, crwn <dig> nuclei exhibited a wide range of chromocenter numbers . a similar pattern was observed in double mutants containing the crwn <dig> mutation . in contrast, double mutants containing the crwn <dig> allele paired with another crwn mutation displayed a reduced average chromocenter number with a weaker association with nuclear size .

to explore the chromocenter phenotype in more detail, we developed a statistic, referred to as an aggregation index  , to characterize the distribution of visible dapi-bright spots within interphase nuclei. the value of this index ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  reflecting both the number of distinct chromocenter spots and the uniformity of their size distribution. the expected ai for wild-type nuclei containing  <dig> equally sized chromocenters is  <dig> , while clustering of chromocenters into fewer but larger aggregates will lead to a higher ai value. a dispersal of chromocenters into smaller heterochromatic satellites will push the ai lower. for a given chromocenter number, a skewed cc size distribution is associated with a larger ai compared to when each cc is equally sized. as shown in figure 6b, the ai index of wild-type nuclei averaged close to  <dig>  and was not affected significantly by nuclear size. the absence of a significant correlation between ai and nuclear size indicates that chromocenter organization remains constant across different endopolyploidy levels in wild-type nuclei. a similar pattern was observed for the crwn <dig>  crwn <dig>  and crwn <dig> mutant samples. in contrast, combining crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> mutations led to an approximately two-fold higher ai over a range of nuclear sizes, consistent with the two-fold reduction in chromocenter number via aggregation in crwn <dig> crwn <dig> mutants. a different pattern was displayed in the crwn <dig> sample, which displayed a negative correlation between ai and nuclear size. this result suggests a tendency for chromocenters to aggregate in smaller crwn <dig> nuclei and to become dispersed in larger crwn <dig> nuclei. the reduction in chromocenter number in crwn <dig> crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> mutants with smaller nuclei could reflect the aggregation of individual chromocenters in the limited confines of these nuclei, but a similar clustering does not occur in small wild-type nuclei, arguing that small nuclear dimensions alone are insufficient to cause clustering. the variability in chromocenter size and number in crwn mutant nuclei suggests that crwn proteins are required for proper organization of heterochromatin in interphase nuclei.

we tested this hypothesis by visualizing the spatial arrangement of chromocenter-associated genomic regions in crwn <dig> crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> mutants. arabidopsis chromocenters are comprised of large segments of repetitive dna such as the tandemly-arrayed centromeric and 5s rna repeats located within pericentromeric regions  <cit> . using fluorescent in situ hybridization , we examined the spatial organization of the major 180-bp centromeric tandem repeat and the 5s rna gene arrays in both large and small nuclei from wild-type, crwn <dig> crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> plants . the centromeric and 5s rna repeats were co-localized with the dapi-bright spots in both small and large wild-type nuclei, confirming previous reports that these sequences are normally compartmentalized within chromocenters at the nuclear periphery  <cit>  . it was common to find a decondensed centromere signal at several chromocenters in wild-type nuclei; however, decondensed centromeric repeat clusters were infrequently observed in crwn <dig> crwn <dig> nuclei and the total number of clusters was reduced  . these findings indicate that there is a compaction of the centromere repeat arrays within coalesced chromocenters in crwn <dig> crwn <dig> nuclei. in contrast, the number of discrete centromere repeat clusters visible in crwn <dig> nuclei was more variable, and decondensed signals were often seen in nuclei with numerous clusters. this pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that chromocenters become dispersed in larger crwn <dig> nuclei. a similar but more pronounced trend was seen for the 5s rna gene arrays , which were dispersed outside chromocenter aggregates in roughly one-half of the crwn <dig> nuclei. we note that the dispersed 5s rna gene signal remained localized to the nuclear periphery . the apparent dispersal of chromocenters in larger crwn <dig> nuclei and the mis-positioning of centromeric and 5s rna repeats outside of the chromocenter indicates that higher-order organization of heterochromatin breaks down in interphase in the absence of crwn <dig> 

discussion
our results demonstrate that the crwn family is essential for viability in arabidopsis and required for proper nuclear organization. redundancy and diversification exists among the four crwn paralogs, which belong to a plant-specific family of nuclear coiled-coil proteins that forms two clades: one including crwn <dig>  crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> and the other containing crwn <dig> . the divergence of crwn <dig> relative to the other crwn paralogs, also reported by kimura et al.   <cit>  and ciska et al.   <cit> , is supported by our genetic analysis. first, the inviability of triple mutants containing either crwn <dig> or crwn <dig> alone indicates that crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> possess non-overlapping functions . second, loss-of-function mutations in crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> have distinct phenotypes; for example, crwn <dig> is the only crwn mutation that affects nuclear size in diploid guard cells , while the dispersed chromocenter phenotype is unique to the crwn <dig> mutant . finally, the functional distinction between the two crwn clades is supported by taxa, such as rice and maize, which contain only two crwn-like proteins: one crwn1-like and one crwn4-like.

the phenotypic effects of combining mutations in different crwn genes demonstrates that all four paralogs are involved in specifying nuclear size in adult cells. a deficiency in crwn <dig> led to a dramatic reduction in nuclear size independent of an effect on endopolyploidy . loss of crwn <dig> also reduced nuclear size in leaf cells  as was recently shown by sakamoto and takagi   <cit> . interestingly, crwn <dig> nuclei in leaf guard cells were not reduced in size , despite the fact that crwn <dig> is expressed in this cell type   <cit> , suggesting cell-type specific requirements exist for different crwn proteins. combining a crwn <dig> loss-of-function mutation with a deficiency in any of the remaining three paralogs causes a further reduction in nuclear size in leaf cells. the additive effect on nuclear size indicates that crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> share overlapping functions with crwn <dig>  although loss of crwn <dig> and/or crwn <dig> has no effect on nuclear size or endopolyploidy in leaf cells when a functional crwn <dig> allele is present. we previously reported that the crwn2- <dig> allele caused a reduction in nuclear size in leaf cells  <cit> ; the reason for the different behavior displayed in this study is unknown, but we have noted variability in nuclear phenotypes among different crwn <dig> mutant lines. regardless, it is clear that crwn <dig> plays the major role in adult leaf tissue among the three paralogs in the crwn1-like clade. this situation might reflect the higher level of expression of crwn <dig> in leaf tissue compared to crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> – ca.  <dig> fpkm  for crwn <dig>  with 4× and 2× less expression from crwn <dig> and crwn <dig>  respectively . alternatively, the different contributions of crwn1-like genes could also result from structural differences among the encoded proteins.

our data indicate that the primary phenotype of crwn mutants is a reduction in nuclear size and that the reduction in endopolyploidy observed in double and triple crwn mutants is a secondary effect in response to reduced nuclear size. first, mutation of either crwn <dig> or crwn <dig> had an effect on nuclear size in leaf cells without affecting endopolyploidy  . second, effects on endopolyploid levels were only seen in mutants that contained two or more crwn mutations and exhibited severely reduced nuclear size. these considerations indicate that loss of crwn activity alters the relationship between dna content and nuclear volume, leading to a higher than normal nuclear dna density. in the most severely affected mutants, the nuclear dna density reaches four times the level seen in wild-type cells. it is intriguing that the crwn mutants with the most abnormal whole-plant dwarfing phenotypes, including crwn <dig> crwn <dig> and the viable triple crwn mutants, are the ones with the highest average nuclear dna density.

we hypothesize that the crwn proteins are required for nuclear expansion after nuclear reformation in telophase  <cit> , and that the loss of these proteins, especially in combination, results in an elevated nuclear dna density. evidence supporting this mechanism comes from a recent report demonstrating that crwn <dig> crwn <dig> cotyledon nuclei expand more slowly than their wild type counterparts during the first 72 hours of seed germination, a period normally characterized by a ca. 10-fold expansion of nuclear size in the absence of endoreduplication  <cit> . interestingly, the rate of contraction of crwn <dig> crwn <dig> embryonic cotyledon nuclei during seed maturation is also reduced relative to wild type. these observations suggest that crwn proteins are involved in remodeling nuclear structure during interphase in response to developmental and environmental cues. similarly, a constraint in nuclear expansion associated with endoreduplication  <cit>  could explain the limit on endopolyploid levels observed in high-order crwn mutants.

the large coiled-coil domains that comprise the central region of all four crwn proteins point toward a structural role in the nucleus. recent analysis based on secondary structure for analogues of arabidopsis coiled-coil proteins indicates that crwn proteins are candidates for paramyosin homologues  <cit> . paramyosin is a structural protein found in invertebrate muscles, where it forms the core of thick filaments and bundles with myosin motors. deficiency of paramyosin, encoded by the unc- <dig> gene in c. elegans, leads to shortened, mis-formed and apparently fragile thick filaments in the nematode’s muscles  <cit> . the structural similarity to paramyosin suggests models for crwn action as architectural components of the nucleoskeleton. models of this type predict that crwn mutant nuclei would have a less sound structural foundation and be more prone to breakage or distortion by intracellular forces , as seen in animal cells when lamin is disrupted  <cit>  or down-regulated  <cit> . the irregular margins and thin projections seen among crwn <dig> nuclei are consistent with this structural integrity model. these predictions, however, are not consistent with the smaller, round nuclei in crwn <dig> mutants that do not adopt the elongated spindle shapes typical of wild-type nuclei in many cell types. these considerations suggest alternative models wherein the crwn <dig> protein might establish flexible hinge regions or expansion zones in the nucleoskeleton, facilitating nuclear size changes that accompany endopolyploidy and other developmental transitions. we note that both nucleoporin  <dig>  <cit>  and linc complex mutants  <cit>  in arabidopsis also lead to more spherical nuclear shapes, suggesting that crwn proteins might interact with these complexes at the nuclear periphery.

deficiency of crwn proteins also affects chromocenter organization . we previously reported that chromocenter number decreases approximately two-fold in crwn <dig> crwn <dig> nuclei  <cit> , and we confirmed these results here while extending our analysis to the entire crwn gene family. one unexpected finding was the wide variation in chromocenter number in crwn <dig> nuclei and the direct correlation between chromocenter number and nuclear size. the reduction in chromocenter number in crwn <dig> crwn <dig> mutants, as well as crwn <dig> mutants with smaller nuclei, is consistent with aggregation of individual chromocenters. the in situ hybridization data shown in figure  <dig> further support this conclusion. further, we demonstrated that chromocenter organization was disrupted in larger crwn <dig> nuclei as evidenced by the dispersed signals seen for the 5s rna genes, and to a less extent, the centromere repeat arrays. considering that chromocenters are localized primarily to the nuclear periphery  <cit>   where crwn proteins are also located  <cit> , crwn proteins might play a direct role in ensuring proper heterochromatin organization. in such models, crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> would act to prevent chromocenter aggregation and crwn <dig> would exert a complementary effect to maintain chromocenter integrity.

the four distinct phenotypes displayed by crwn mutants – reduced nuclear size, altered nuclear shape, elevated nuclear dna density and abnormal organization of constitutive heterochromatin – highlight a functional connection among these different aspects of nuclear architecture. the lack of whole-plant phenotypes of arabidopsis crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> mutants is remarkable in light of the dramatic nuclear changes occurring in these mutants and underscores plants’ plasticity in their ability to execute an apparently normal developmental program in spite of these nuclear changes. the diversity of crwn proteins and the ability to work with viable crwn mutants that exhibit dramatic nuclear phenotypes will facilitate the elucidation of the mechanisms through which these essential proteins exert their effects on nuclear organization.

CONCLUSIONS
this study addresses fundamental questions about how plant cells specify and control the morphology of their nuclei and its relationship with internal chromatin organization. we conducted a comprehensive reverse genetics study of the crwn gene family in arabidopsis, which encode nmcp-class proteins implicated in nuclear morphology and organization. we demonstrated that crwn proteins are essential for viability, and in the process, uncovered a surprisingly high degree of functional diversity among the crwn proteins. crwn <dig> and crwn <dig> are the major determinants of nuclear size and shape, and we hypothesize that deficiency in crwn proteins leads to defects in nuclear expansion and remodeling. one consequence of this deficiency is an increase in nuclear dna density as endoreduplication levels are not affected except in the most extreme cases . our findings also demonstrated that crwn <dig> plays a role in maintenance of heterochromatin organization in interphase nuclei. the specificity of the nuclear morphological and higher-order chromatin organization defects seen in crwn mutants reveals the interplay between nuclear morphology and the three-dimensional packaging of the genome.
