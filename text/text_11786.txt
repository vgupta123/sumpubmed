BACKGROUND
the mammalian gastrointestinal tract  is colonized by a complex microbiota, which interacts with the host mucosa and maintains mucosal homeostasis in healthy individuals  <cit> . studies on mice model have shown that the initial development of immune system is profoundly influenced by the colonization of gut microbiota  <cit> . the deficiency of immune maturation and the development of intolerance towards commensal bacteria may lead to chronic inflammatory diseases later in life  <cit> . the maintenance of intestinal immune and physiological homeostasis in mammals is mediated by sophisticated interaction between intestinal microbiota and the host mucosa, which consists of the epithelial cell layer and underlying lamina propria. the epithelial cell layer is not merely a physical barrier, but also responds to stimuli, e.g. by secreting mucus and inducing innate and adaptive immune responses  <cit> . intestinal epithelial cells  express several pattern recognition receptors  and can detect microorganism-associated molecular patterns  and subsequently release effector cytokines. thus, iecs are important players in orchestrating tolerance or inflammatory responses against the resident microbiota. commensal microbes have often developed a mutualistic relationship with the host and induce tolerogenic or immunoregulatory responses in the host  <cit> .

adhesion is considered as a crucial step for intestinal bacteria to colonize and further interact with the host epithelium and immune system. intestinal bacteria can adhere to mucus, or bind to exposed iecs via their surface structures  <cit> . lactobacillus species can be found along the mammalian git with various counts, typically being more dominant in the proximal small intestine  <cit> . the majority of strains utilized as probiotics belong to the genus lactobacillus and a number of strains have been shown to adhere strongly to the epithelium  <cit> . probiotics have been shown to modulate immune responses, being able to competitively exclude pathogenic bacteria, and enhance epithelial barrier functions  <cit> . promising results have been obtained also in alleviating gastrointestinal disorders  <cit> .

in response to enteropathogen infection, the intestinal epithelium releases proinflammatory molecules to recruit immune cells and induce an acute inflammatory response. inflammation is an essential physiological response to infection and tissue protection, but non-regulated inflammatory responses can give rise to tissue injury and chronic disease  <cit> . interleukin- <dig>  is one of the key chemokines, which is responsible for the initiation of inflammatory cascades and recruitment of neutrophils into the mucosa  <cit> . it is considered, that after the acute inflammation, commensal bacteria have a key role in providing regulatory immune stimuli to extinguish the inflammation back to basal level  <cit> . also probiotics have been demonstrated to suppress mucosal inflammation and restore cytokine balance towards an anti-inflammatory state  <cit> .

lactobacillus acidophilus strain lab <dig> was isolated from canine small intestine, where it was found to be among predominant jejunal lactobacilli  <cit> . further, administered lab <dig> could persist in the dog gut for more than six weeks post-administration  <cit> , which is a remarkably long period for a probiotic strain. typically, probiotics are cleared from the majority of patients within weeks after the administration is terminated  <cit> . in the present study, we investigated the interaction of lab <dig> with the host epithelium. we studied it’s adhesion ability to canine mucus and iecs from different compartment of dog intestine and to iec lines. further, we assessed the ability of lab <dig> to attenuate lps-induced il- <dig> release from iecs and to fortify epithelial barrier function.

RESULTS
adhesion to mucus
first, we studied the ability of l. acidophilus lab <dig> to bind mucus isolated from duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon of canine intestine. we found that lab <dig> showed very similar adhesion efficiency to canine mucus despite the mucus type i.e. from which intestinal compartments the mucus was isolated from . next, the capacity of lab <dig> to adhere canine, human and porcine colonic mucus was compared. human derived strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg , which has previously been shown to bind to human colonic mucus  <cit>  was included in the experiment for comparison. lab <dig> presented statistically significantly higher adhesion to canine colonic mucus  compared to adhesion to porcine  mucus . however, the binding of lab <dig> to human  mucus was not significantly different from adhesion to canine mucus. lgg adhered to human  and porcine  mucus more efficiently than lab <dig> , whereas lab <dig> showed higher adhesion to canine mucus .figure  <dig>

adhesion to iecs
next, we studied the adherence of lab <dig> to the epithelial cell lines of different ages. caco- <dig> cells differentiate in  <dig> days after confluence  <cit> , and the adhesion was examined with undifferentiated cells  in addition to cells at two differentiation stages . for comparison, the same growth times were used for ht- <dig> cell line. lab <dig> adhered similarly to caco- <dig> and ht- <dig> cell lines and there was no statistically significant difference in the adherence of lab <dig> to iecs of different ages except the adhesion to 3-days old caco- <dig> cells was significantly lower compared to 8-days old but not to 21-days old caco- <dig> cells . in order to examine the adhesion of lab <dig> to canine iecs, fitc-labeled lab <dig> cells were visualized with epifluorescence microscopy. lab <dig> adhered to canine iecs isolated from various parts of the intestine . the adherence to iecs isolated from cecum and colon seemed higher than to iecs from duodenum, jejunum or ileum, but the assay did not allow proper quantitative measurement and therefore, this difference remains unconfirmed.figure  <dig>

ability to attenuate lps-induced il- <dig> production of enterocytes
in order to assess the potential anti-inflammatory properties of lab <dig>  we measured its ability to reduce the lps-induced release of il- <dig> from the ht- <dig> cell line. the attenuation effect on il- <dig> production was evaluated by incubating ht- <dig> monolayer with lps  after the cell line was first exposed to fresh and freeze-dried lab <dig> and sterile culture medium . prior co-incubation of ht- <dig> cells with fresh lab <dig> decreased significantly  the lps-stimulated il- <dig> production with both lps concentrations. however, the freeze-dried lab <dig> did not show reduction of secreted il- <dig> as compared to the freshly cultured lab <dig> cells. taken together, the results showed that the decrease of il- <dig> production, obtained by incubation with lab <dig>  was depended on the properties of active, living cells. lab <dig> recovery from the freeze-dried stage takes more than  <dig> hours and thus we presumed it to remain inactive during the one hour incubation of attenuation experiment.figure  <dig>

in order to disclose the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-inflammatory action of lab <dig> we constructed a recombinant derivate strain, saa <dig>  to down-regulate the transcription of the exopolysaccharide synthesis epse gene in lab <dig> using antisense rna strategy . this strategy was chosen because knock-out mutants were not possible to construct due to the low transformation frequency  of lab <dig>  our preliminary results suggest that exopolysaccharide  of lab <dig> may have a role in the immunomodulatory activity of lab <dig> . however, the detailed properties of the derivate strain and the effector molecules of anti-inflammatory action still need to be resolved.

effects of lab <dig> on epithelial barrier function
the effect of lab <dig> on epithelial barrier function was studied by measuring transepithelial electric resistance . nonpathogenic escherichia coli has been shown to disrupt the caco- <dig> monolayer  <cit>  and we included e. coli top <dig> in the experiment as a negative control. the epithelial cells were incubated with lab <dig>  e. coli or sterile culture medium for  <dig> hours and ter was measured every  <dig> hours. ter of epithelial cells treated with lab <dig> was significantly higher as compared to cells treated with culture medium . in contrast, e. coli decreased ter significantly already within  <dig> hours.figure  <dig>

discussion
host-microbial interactions in the git are important for gut health, first by inducing the maturation of gut immune system in early life, and later in maintaining immune and physiological homeostasis of the mucosa  <cit> . it is considered that for an effective interaction with the host mucosa, bacteria must adhere to intestinal mucus or iecs. adherence of probiotic bacteria to the intestinal epithelium is an important characteristic as it also promotes persistence time and colonization.

l. acidophilus lab <dig> showed approximately  <dig> - <dig> % adhesion to canine mucus isolated from different intestinal compartments  whereas the adhesion was lower to human- or porcine-derived mucus . instead, human-derived strain l. rhamnosus gg showed overall the highest adhesion ability to human colonic mucus. the results reinforce the suggestion that the adhesion of bacteria toward mucus is strain-specific, which may be due to the various bacterial surface structures associate with adhesion  <cit> . on the other hand, strains may display some degree of host specificity in the adhesion, although the strain origin is not always reflected in host specificity in adhesion  <cit> .

the result showed that lab <dig> could adhere to both caco- <dig> and ht- <dig> cell lines, which are commonly used in vitro models to study microbe-iec interactions  <cit> . further, with access to canine iecs from different intestinal compartments, we presented that lab <dig> could adhere to canine iecs as well. canine intestinal epithelial cell lines are not commercially available and therefore, we used iecs isolated from duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon biopsies of healthy dogs. the gastrointestinal epithelium is covered with mucus, which forms a thick, continuous layer in the large intestine. however, in the small intestine, the mucus layer is thinner and discontinuous, allowing direct contact between epithelial cells and luminal bacteria. also, under certain conditions, the mucus barrier is reduced, and bacteria can penetrate the layer and adhere to the underlying epithelial cells  <cit> . the canine jejunal isolate, lab <dig>  was previously found to persist in the gut of healthy dog for over six weeks after cessation of administration  <cit> . the long persistence in the canine git might be due to the effective adhesion to host iecs in the small intestine.

lab <dig> was originally isolated from healthy canine jejunum, which makes it intriguing to it’s potential immunomodulatory effects. canine primary colonic epithelial cells isolated from normal dogs express tlr <dig> that can be stimulated in response to lps  <cit> . on the other hand, increased expression of tlr <dig> has been linked to inflammatory bowel disease  in dogs  <cit> . further, lps-carrying proteobacteria are increased in human ibd subjects  <cit> , and this bacterial phylum and lps may play a role also in canine ibd. in this study, we used lps-induced inflammation in ht- <dig> cell line as a model, because ht- <dig> cells express tlr <dig> that mediates lps stimulation in iecs  <cit> . we found that lab <dig> is able to attenuate lps-induced release of il- <dig> from ht- <dig> cell line. previously, it has been shown that the stimulation of iecs with one mamp can induce tolerance towards other mamps and modulate the inflammatory response of iecs  <cit> . this is a likely scenario also in the case of the attenuation of lps-induced il- <dig> secretion by lab <dig>  the result indicates that lab <dig> could balance the il- <dig> expression of enterocytes in response to apical stimulation by lps from gram-negative bacteria in the intestine. most of the lps-carrying bacteria in the git are harmless commensals. however, if the host responses to them are inappropriate or exaggerated, chronic inflammation  may ensue. there is growing evidence that aberrant innate immune responses towards the gut microbiota play a role in the pathogenesis of canine ibd  <cit> . importantly, tlr <dig> expression is increased in dogs suffering from chronic enteropathies including ibd  <cit> . thus, lab <dig> seems to be able to induce in iecs tolerogenic response towards lps derived from the intestinal microbiota.

previously, bifidobacteria and lactobacillus fermentum have been demonstrated to inhibit lps or yersinia enterocolitica –induced il- <dig> production by iecs  <cit> . moreover, several studies have shown that bifidobacteria and lactobacilli can reduce the severity of inflammation in vivo in rodent models and patients with ibd  <cit> . our preliminary results suggest that eps of lab <dig> may have a role in the immunomodulatory activity of lab <dig> . lactobacillus amylovorus inhibits the tlr <dig> inflammatory signaling triggered by enterotoxigenic e. coli and tlr <dig> is required for the suppression of tlr <dig> signaling activation  <cit> . further, eps of lactobacillus delbrueckii have been shown to attenuate enterotoxigenic e. coli -induced inflammatory response in porcine iecs and tlr <dig> plays a central role in the immunomodulatory action  <cit> . concerning lab <dig>  further studies are needed to confirm the anti-inflammatory properties in vivo in dogs.

one of the proposed mechanisms of action of probiotic lab is the ability to strengthen the epithelial barrier  <cit> . we measured caco- <dig> cell monolayer’s resistance, ter, as an indicator of gi-epithelial barrier function. co-culture of caco- <dig> cells with lab <dig> fortified epithelial barrier, as demonstrated by the increase in ter. the caco- <dig> cell line is a well-characterized model of the gut epithelium and is capable of differentiation and polarization  <cit>  and measuring ter of polarized cell monolayers is commonly used as a screening assay to test for probiotic effects  <cit> . as expected, the non-pathogenic e. coli used in the experiment as a control disrupted the barrier integrity  <cit> . thus, lab <dig> can fortify intestinal barrier function by tightening the epithelial cell layer and inducing tolerance towards lps.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we demonstrated that canine derived strain lab <dig> has potential as a probiotic as it adheres to mucus and iecs and interact with the host. specifically, it fortifies epithelial cell layer, and is able to elicit anti-inflammatory responses in enterocytes. the anti-inflammatory property appeared to be associated with cell viability and activity, but the precise mechanisms, especially the components responsible for anti-inflammatory functions remain to be identified.
