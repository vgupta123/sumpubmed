BACKGROUND
one of the challenges that medical research must address in the near future is to understand why some animals are able to regenerate complex structures, including eyes and even whole bodies, from small body fragments, while others are not. with the recent emergence of the field of regenerative medicine, the future biomedical ramifications of the study of animal regeneration are obvious.

freshwater planarians are a classic model for studying the fascinating process of regeneration  <cit>  because they are capable of re-building a complete organism from almost any small body fragment. this is made possible by a unique population of adult somatic stem cells called neoblasts. during regeneration and constant homeostatic cell turnover, neoblasts differentiate into all cell types, including germ cells in sexual species  <cit> . in recent years, several studies have begun to unravel the mechanisms by which regeneration is regulated at the molecular level. for example, different genes have been shown to play pivotal roles in axon guidance and neurogenesis  <cit> , the regulation of neoblast proliferation and differentiation  <cit> , and the re-establishment and maintenance of the anteroposterior  and dorsoventral  body axes  <cit> . schmidtea mediterranea and dugesia japonica are the two planarian species most often used in regeneration studies. there are about  <dig>  ests  for s. mediterranea in ncbi generated in different projects  <cit> . those sequences were clustered to produce a set of  <dig>  putative mrnas which are available from the ncbi unigene database  <cit> . the s. mediterranea genome has also been sequenced and assembled  <cit>  at the genome sequencing center at washington university in st. louis  after approval of a white paper  <cit> . however, because of this genome's internal complexity  and the lack of a bac library, its completeness and assembly still needs improvement. a step towards this end was taken when the s. mediterranea genome and est information were integrated and approximately  <dig>  genes were predicted using an annotation pipeline called maker <cit> . those gene models, together with ~ <dig>  mrnas generated using next-generation sequencing technology, were mapped on the planarian genome and used to improve the assembly  <cit> . the current assembly contains  <dig>  contigs. these are accessible, together with the maker annotation data, in the s. mediterranea genome database .

in order to expand our knowledge of the planarian transcriptome and to provide a new tool that can be used to improve the s. mediterranea genome annotation, we generated a new transcriptome dataset using  <dig> pyrosequencing technology  <cit> . the smed <dig> dataset can be freely accessed via a website, and the complete sequence data can be downloaded by anyone from there. mapping of the smed <dig> ests onto the genome scaffolds shows that the smed <dig> dataset contains more than  <dig> million nucleotides sequenced de novo. in addition, this mapping extends and connects currently fragmented genomic contigs. finally, go annotation of the smed <dig> dataset assigns candidate functions to those sequences and facilitates their grouping into distinct gene families. in this way, whole gene families can be analyzed for putative roles in planarian regeneration. thus we are confident that the smed <dig> dataset will improve our understanding of how planarian regeneration works at the molecular level.

RESULTS
construction and sequencing of the smed <dig> dataset
in order to obtain the most representative set of planarian genes expressed under different physiological conditions, total rna was isolated from a mixture of non-irradiated and irradiated intact and regenerating planarians . we used planarians regenerating both head and tail to identify the genes specifically expressed in a tissue-specific manner. similarly, planarians at different stages of regeneration were used in order to isolate genes with different temporal expression profiles. irradiation destroys planarian neoblasts within 1- <dig> days, and the animals die within a few weeks because they cannot sustain normal cell turnover. by including irradiated animals, potential transcripts specifically expressed under those conditions will be contained in the  <dig> dataset.

using  <dig> pyrosequencing,  <dig>  sequencing reads with an average length of  <dig> bp were obtained. after sequence cleaning to remove vector contamination, the remaining  <dig>  sequences were assembled using different cut-off values for sequence similarity . in addition, our  <dig> sequence reads were assembled together with the ~ <dig>  s. mediterranea unigene set available at ncbi, using the 90% similarity criteria. this last set, which was used in most of the analyses reported, is referred to as the 90e set. table  <dig> summarizes the number of contigs and singletons obtained in each of those assemblies. the similarities between the three assemblies  are illustrated in figure  <dig> a venn diagram which shows that  <dig> % of the raw sequencing reads were integrated into contigs common to all three assemblies, and  <dig> % of the sequencing reads make up a shared pool of single sequencing reads . therefore, differences between the assemblies can be explained by differential inclusion corresponding to  <dig> % of the sequencing reads.

set names are related to the corresponding homology level cutoff value . contigs are the result of at least two sequencing reads, and singletons of only one read. gc content is the average value for all sequences. sequence lengths are shown as minimum, median, maximum and average values in nucleotides for each set.

average gc content and sequence length and their respective distributions were similar for all three assemblies . gc content is distributed around 35%, the expected value for coding sequences in this species. the 90e length distribution shape was slightly shifted towards larger sequences. this shift was mainly due to a set of long sequences  from the ncbi unigene ests included in this assembly. this causal relationship was evident in the comparison of the following four subsets of sequences from the 90e set : singletons , contigs that do not contain unigene ests , contigs including unigene ests , and finally, unigene ests not assembled into a contig .

mapping the 90e assembly onto the genome
the 90e assembly  was aligned to scaffolds from the s. mediterranea wusl genome assembly, version  <dig>   <cit>  . figure  <dig> shows all possible high-scoring segment pair  relationships between those two sequence sets. from almost  <dig> million initial hsps, around  <dig> million were selected using a combination of thresholds, as described in the methods section. discarding singleton sequences in a second round of filtering further reduced the number of hsps to  <dig> million, and hsp coverage dropped from  <dig> % and  <dig> %, for scaffolds and 90e respectively, to  <dig> % and  <dig> %. however, when the total nucleotide length was considered only for the contigs , hsp coverage for 90e rose to  <dig> %. this means that most of the significant hsp hits are retained after the second round of filtering. in total,  <dig>  contigs from 90e did not map to the genomic contigs . conversely,  <dig>  genomic contigs did not match a sequence from 90e . of the 90e contigs,  <dig> extended a genomic sequence from the left  and  <dig>  from the right . the largest intergenic distance was  <dig>  bp, with an average value of  <dig>  bp . the largest intron was estimated to be about  <dig>  bp, the average length being  <dig> bp . finally, there were  <dig>  hsps connecting different genomic sequences via  <dig>  different 90e contigs . of the  <dig>  90e contigs not found on the genome,  <dig>  had a blast hit to the ncbi nr protein database , and, of those,  <dig>  had a hit to a protein with go annotation . after discarding abundant actin-like sequences , atp/adp transporter proteins  and sequences matching bacterial, protozoan or fungal genes ,  <dig> 90e contigs remained as new sequences not mapping on the genome .

in order to validate exonic structures,  <dig>  90e contigs mapping 1-to- <dig> over genome sequences were selected. after re-aligning the 90e/genomic sequence pairs,  <dig>  contained at least one putative intron . in total  <dig>  introns were retrieved from the genomic contigs. figure  <dig> shows the number of introns per 90e contig, as well as the length distribution for those introns. pictograms summarize the nucleotide frequencies for the donor and acceptor splice sites, both for the u <dig>  and u <dig>  introns. the splice sites patterns resemble those from other metazoan  <cit> , taking into account that the genome of s.mediterranea is a/t-rich  <cit> .

also,  <dig> randomly picked 90e contigs that either mapped or did not map to the genome were validated by rt-pcr . additionally,  <dig> out of those  <dig> genes were further validated by sequencing. finally, to further confirm the quality and coverage of the sequences from the 90e dataset, the s. mediterranea genes already annotated in ncbi genbank  <cit>  were compared with those sequences. after discarding  <dig> s and  <dig> s ribosomal rna genes and alpha-tubulins,  <dig> known genes were aligned to the 90e sequences. in total,  <dig> of these genes had at least one significant similarity hit with one 90e sequence, and two matched  <dig> sequences from 90e. on average, the known genes had co-linear similarity hits against  <dig>  different smed <dig> sequences. minimum and average similarities were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, and  <dig> sequences had more than 95% similarity. mean coverage dropped to  <dig> % when each hit was considered separately. a summary of these similarity analyses is shown in additional file  <dig> 

browsing the smed <dig> dataset
in order to make the smed <dig> dataset useful and accessible to the planarian and non-planarian communities, a public database is available via web  <cit> . the web site allows users to view contig assemblies along with their read alignments, and to perform blast searches against assembled sequences. the blast option in the home page menu  allows the user to blast sequences of interest against the  <dig>   <dig>  and 90e databases . both nucleotide  and protein  searches can be performed . clicking on the search button  brings up a new window displaying a list of hits. when a score value is selected , the alignment between the query sequence and the smed <dig> hit is shown. the site also offers the option of downloading smed <dig> sequences of interest . the contig or singleton accession number can be browsed directly from the main home page . when the user searches for a specific contig, a new window appears showing the alignment of all the sequencing reads assembled in that contig. at the bottom of that window, the result of a pre-computed blast on the contig consensus sequence is displayed. when a contig, singleton or read name is selected , a new window will display the requested sequence. all raw and assembled sequence data are available from that web site too.

functional annotation of 90e sequences
in order to characterize the gene families that can be found on smed <dig>  we annotated the three datasets; we will focus on 90e dataset here. in total,  <dig> % of the sequences had a similarity hit with at least one protein sequence in the ncbi nr protein database  <cit> . of these, almost two-thirds had  <dig> or more hits , but the blastx output was limited to a maximum of  <dig> hits per 90e sequence owing to the large number of hsps reported by blast for some of them. the gene ontology   <cit>  database was used to computationally annotate all the sequences  by mapping onto them the functional codes already assigned to known proteins from ncbi nr. many of these sequence hits matched to a short atp-binding domain, in most cases corresponding to proteins of the actins family. consequently, that functional class, which was also anomalously over-represented, was discarded from the total number of annotations for the 90e set, as shown in table  <dig> 

the most probable go code in the three ontology categories--molecular function, biological process and cellular component-- for each sequence in the 90e data set was selected. for simplicity, only level one and two codes are shown here in order.

among the most abundant go annotations at the biological process level, leaving aside metabolism-related features, 'response to stress' was found for  <dig>  sequences . this finding was expected because the original biological sample was a mixture of intact and regenerating planarians, both normal and irradiated. 'regulation of biological process' was in the same range, with  <dig>  sequences . at the go molecular function level, 'binding' was the most common annotation, although where possible a more specific annotion was provided by drilling down to the 2nd level child annotations on the go graph. it is interesting to find, among others,  <dig> 'selenium binding' activities, since it has been reported that selenium may play an important role in cancer prevention, immune system function, male fertility, cardiovascular and muscle disorders, and prevention and control of the ageing process  <cit> . finding selenium-binding proteins would be evidence of the presence of selenoproteins, which are thought to be responsible for most of the biomedical effects of selenium across eukaryota  <cit> . when looking at the cellular component level and discarding many of the 'intracellular organelles' due to their co-occurrence with 'nucleotide binding', there are a notably large number of 'protein complexes',  <dig>  sequences . with  <dig> sequences , another important term on this level is 'vesicle', which correlates with secretory functions, apoptosis, and autophagy.

to prove the usefulness of the smed <dig> dataset, we performed several searches on specific groups and gene families for which only scant data has been reported to date in planarians. planarians are mainly known for their remarkable regenerative capabilities, which depend upon the presence of stem cells named neoblasts. because of the unique properties of these cells, some studies have used a microarray-based strategy to detect neoblast-specific genes  <cit> . in our smed <dig> dataset we were able to identify, in addition to known neoblast markers such as piwis, histones, bruli, vasa or tudor, several other genes annotated as involved in cell cycle or dna damage and repair . within these gene set we find many cyclins and cell cycle division-related genes but also genes related to replication and chromosome maintenance. finally, genes related to stress response and dna damage were also identified, probably owing to the use of irradiated animals in the generation of the smed <dig> dataset. in addition to these neoblast-related genes we were able to identify large collections of much less well-characterized families in planarians, such as neurotransmitter, peptide and hormone receptors, homeobox domain-containing genes, and genes related to eye function in other animals.

prediction of planarian transmembrane proteins
transmembrane  proteins regulate a number of biological processes ranging from catalytic processes in intracellular and extracellular transport to cell-to-cell communication. tm proteins have become particularly interesting as many of them are key initiators of signal transduction pathways, and they can be easily manipulated by small molecule- or antibody-based drugs. to identify putative tm proteins from the planarian transcriptome, we mined the  <dig> dataset for putative tm protein-encoding messages . considering only the proteins that at least two application predicted would contain one or more transmembrane domains, resulted in a list of  <dig>  predicted transmembrane proteins , which represents  <dig> % of the complete protein database. protein-blast searches were then used to align sequences to each other, and redundant sequences were removed from the predicted transmembrane set. the resulting database contained  <dig>  sequences. functional categorization using the ufo web-server  <cit>  allowed us to assign pfam protein families to  <dig>  of the sequences and gene ontology classifications to  <dig> . the top ten pfam domains  included, for example, the classifications for 'major facilitator superfamily' , ' <dig> transmembrane receptor ' and 'ion transport protein' . the top ten gene ontology profiles  included 'membrane' , 'transport', and 'g-protein coupled receptor protein signalling pathway' . the enrichment of our database with proteins that have a predicted function in transport and receptor signalling supports the reliability of our approach. a complete list of the  <dig>  predicted transmembrane proteins, the number of predicted transmembrane domains, predicted topology, and functional categorizations  are shown in additional file  <dig> 

neurotransmitter and hormone receptors in schmidtea mediterranea
despite our growing knowledge about how planarian neoblasts are regulated at the molecular level  <cit> , we are still far from characterizing the complete repertoire of factors that control neoblast biology. receptors for neurotransmitters, peptides and hormones are among the candidates for a role in the regulation of neoblast proliferation, differentiation and migration. in planarians, some of the data suggest that molecules such as dopamine  <cit> , serotonin  <cit> , substance p  <cit> , somatostatin  <cit>  and fmrfamide  <cit>  can accelerate or delay the regeneration rate, probably by regulating neoblast proliferation and/or differentiation. a model has been proposed in which neoblasts express receptors for some of these factors, which in turn regulate the fate of these cells  <cit> . we found  <dig> contigs and singletons in the annotated smed <dig> dataset with significant homology to neurotransmitter and hormone receptors , providing a list of potentially interesting candidates.

homeobox-containing sequences in schmidtea mediterranea
since the first homeobox-containing genes were characterized in planarians  <cit> , a large number of hox and parahox genes that could be accommodated into the classical series of paralogous groups from plhox <dig> to plohox- <dig> and xlox to cad/cdx  <cit>  have been described. some of them show a differentially axial nested expression; while others are ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . most of this work has been done in the planarians girardia tigrina and dugesia japonica. recently, the first expression of an s. mediterranea hox gene has been reported  <cit> . we identified  <dig> contigs and singletons with significant sequence similarity to homeobox gene sequences in the annotated smed <dig> dataset , including hox genes and homeobox-containing genes, some already characterized in other planarian species.

eye genes in schmidtea mediterranea
the structural simplicity of the planarian eye in conjunction with the regenerative abilities of these organisms provides a unique system for dissecting the genetic mechanisms that allow a simple visual structure to be built  <cit> . despite great morphological differences, there is evidence that the early morphogenesis of animal eyes requires the regulatory activity of pax <dig>  sine oculis , eyes absent  and dachshund , a gene network known as the retinal determination gene network   <cit> . most of the genetic elements of the rdgn have been characterized in planarians  <cit> . in addition, the following planarian genes have been identified as being involved in eye regeneration: djeye <dig>  dj1020hh  <cit> ; smed-netr, smed-netrin <dig>  <cit> ; gt/smed/dj ops  <cit> ; djsnap- <dig>  <cit> ; and smednos  <cit> . in order to characterize new s. mediterranea eye network genes, we analyzed the smed <dig> annotated dataset and found a collection of genes, ranging from transcription factors to eye-realizator genes, which have been implicated in eye development in other systems. these are good candidates for expanding our knowledge about the genetic network responsible for planarian eye regeneration .

CONCLUSIONS
the inherent complexity of the planarian genome and methodological difficulties initially prevented the complete genome assembly of s. mediterranea. high-throughput sequencing technologies are now well established and help molecular biologists to unravel the molecular components of organisms. we present a  <dig> sequencing dataset that can be used to decipher the transcriptome of the planarian s. mediterranea, an organism that has great potential for the study of regeneration processes.

we obtained more than half a million sequencing reads and assembled them into different datasets using a number of different similarity thresholds. the complete dataset has been made publicly available via web  <cit> . about  <dig>  contigs in one of those sets  were mapped against the most up-to-date genome scaffolds and to the set of known proteins from ncbi nr. interestingly, we found a large number of transcribed sequences not covered by the genome sequence . the novel  <dig> contigs will allow us to extend current genomic sequences and connect up to  <dig>  pairs of genome scaffolds. furthermore, a preliminary analysis of the planarian splice sites was made on a collection of  <dig> contigs mapped univocally to the genome. annotation of the sequences yielded a number of gene candidates in different functional categories that will be useful for further experimental studies. however, many of the novel contigs have no similarity to known proteins and will require further validation if we want to understand the transcriptional inventory of the planarian at a functional level. we also provided a preliminary gene annotation for s. mediterranea, focusing our rankings on four different gene families; these serve as applied examples of the usefulness of this new sequence resource.
