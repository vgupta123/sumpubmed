BACKGROUND
the mouse skeletal muscle is composed of four distinct fiber types, i.e., the type i, iia, iix and iib fibers that differ in respect to contractile function, the number of mitochondria and metabolism. the slow type i fibers can sustain prolonged low power work, contain more mitochondria and exhibit higher rates of fat oxidative metabolism. the fast type iix and iib fibers are adapted to brief and intense contractions, contain fewer mitochondria and generate energy mainly through glycolysis. the type iia fibers exhibit an intermediate contractile function and are oxidoglycolytic  <cit> . every muscle type has a specific composition and distribution of the four different fiber types. the soleus contains the highest number of type i fibers, whereas both the quadriceps and gastrocnemius are muscle groups that contain predominantly type ii fibers  <cit> . however, varying percentages of type i fibers ranging from 0-45% for the quadriceps and 1-8% for the gastrocnemius are reported  <cit> .

numerous genes have been identified playing a role in the generation of more oxidative muscle types  <cit> . the most extensively studied gene is calcineurin . in the c2c <dig> cell line, cna up-regulates the mrna levels of genes that are markers for the slow fiber types. additionally, studies with cna transgenic mice have reported an increase of oxidative fibers in the skeletal muscle  <cit> . pgc1α is another well-established factor that induces remodeling of skeletal muscle fiber type composition. lin et al.  <cit>  showed that when pgc1α is expressed at physiological levels in muscle groups normally rich in type ii fibers a fiber type conversion occurs from type ii fibers to type i fibers  <cit> . in line with this, mortensen et al.  <cit>  showed that pgc1α overexpression in primary rat skeletal muscle cells induces a switch towards a more oxidative fiber type. finally, muscle-specific overexpression of pparδ resulted in the increase of the number of oxidative fibers and in higher expression levels of several markers of oxidative metabolism  <cit> .

the first aim of the present study was to find novel genes that may play a role in specifying muscle types. therefore we compared gene expression profiles of the gastrocnemius with the quadriceps at the level of the whole-transcriptome. functional implications were assessed by the analyses of predefined gene sets based on gene ontology, biochemical, metabolic and signaling pathways. recently, we studied the effects of a short-term high fat diet  on skeletal muscle gene and protein expression. since both gene and protein levels of markers of the more oxidative fiber types were increased in the quadriceps of hfd mice we hypothesized that an hfd can induce a conversion towards a more oxidative fiber type via a transcriptional mechanism  <cit> . the second aim of the present study therefore was to explore the diet-sensitivity of genes that are involved in the determination of muscle types. we compared expression patterns of genes that are differentially expressed between muscle types in mice fed a low fat diet  with mice fed an hfd.

RESULTS
microarray analysis shows that the majority of genes involved in the determination of muscle types are not influenced by diet
to obtain more insight in genes involved in specifying muscle types we compared the gastrocnemius transcriptome with the quadriceps transcriptome of 8-week lfd mice. when using the criteria of a fold change >  <dig>  and an fdr <  <dig> , we found  <dig> genes with an increased expression and  <dig> genes with a decreased expression in the gastrocnemius as compared to the quadriceps. the ten genes with the strongest increased and decreased expression levels are shown in table  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  the ten genes with the strongest increased expression included markers of oxidative fiber types , but also genes from the hox family . in fact, hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> were the genes with the strongest increased expression in the gastrocnemius. the ten genes with the strongest decreased expression contained a variety of genes such as scd <dig> and cidec, which are involved in lipogenesis, and pck <dig>  which plays a role in gluconeogenesis, but also the dkk <dig> and tbx <dig> genes, which are important during embryogenesis. a complete list of all differentially expressed genes is available in supplement  <dig>  qpcr analyses were performed for  <dig> genes validating the microarray results .

by microarray analysis we found  <dig> that were differentially expressed in the gastrocnemius as compared with the quadriceps from mice fed an 8-week lfd. this table shows the ten strongest up-regulated and ten strongest down-regulated genes in the gastrocnemius as compared with the quadriceps .

to relate changes in gene expression to biological changes we applied erminej and gsea. by using ermine j we identified  <dig> go classes that were overrepresented in the gastrocnemius . these overrepresented go classes were mainly descriptors for contraction, morphogenesis, remodeling and development. other overrepresented go classes included descriptors for calcium homeostasis, immune function and metabolic processes. a parallel gsea was used to identify up- or down-regulated processes. gsea revealed that ten gene sets were down-regulated including three gene sets related to the cell cycle, two gene sets describing amino acid metabolism and two gene sets corresponding to immune function. only the gene sets "striated muscle contraction" and "ribosome" were up-regulated in the gastrocnemius as compared with the quadriceps. among the core-enriched genes in the gene set "striated muscle contraction" were genes that are markers for oxidative fiber types, whereas all core-enriched genes in the gene set "ribosome" were ribosomal proteins which are involved in translation .

erminej was used to identify significantly overrepresented go classes in the gastrocnemius as compared with the quadriceps from lfd mice . for the concept biological process we selected go classes with a fdr <  <dig> . for this analysis only classes containing  <dig> through  <dig> genes were taken into account. n, number of genes in go class

gsea was applied to identify up-regulated and down-regulated processes in the gastrocnemius as compared with the quadriceps in lfd mice. presented are regulated processes with a false discovery rate  <  <dig> . an fdr was calculated to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing. sources of the gene sets: 1genmapp, 2kegg, 3biocarta. n, number of genes; es, enrichment score for the gene set, that reflects the degree to which a gene set is overrepresented at the top or bottom of the ranked list; fdr, nes, normalized enrichment score, that is, the normalized es to account for the size of the set.

the diet-sensitivity of differentially expressed genes, overrepresented go classes and regulated gene sets was studied by comparing the gastrocnemius with the quadriceps under hfd conditions . in the hfd mice we found  <dig> differentially expressed genes in the gastrocnemius as compared to the quadriceps. a total of  <dig> genes was overlapping with the differentially expressed genes in the lfd mice. interestingly, these overlapping genes were all regulated in the same direction with a comparable fold change. a total of  <dig> genes was only differentially expressed in hfd mice, whereas  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in lfd mice suggesting that these genes are diet-dependent. under hfd conditions, erminej revealed that  <dig> go classes were overrepresented in the gastrocnemius as compared to the quadriceps. a total of  <dig> go classes showed an overlap with the overrepresented go classes under lfd conditions. the other overrepresented go classes corresponded also to contraction, morphogenesis, remodeling, development, calcium homeostasis, immune function and metabolic processes. gsea showed that  <dig> gene sets were down-regulated including five gene sets describing cell cycle and four gene sets related to amino acid metabolism. only one gene set "striated muscle contraction" was up-regulated in the gastrocnemius vs. the quadriceps. a total of six gene sets  were overlapping between the lfd and hfd condition.

to summarize, we showed that a considerable number of genes is differentially expressed in the gastrocnemius as compared with the quadriceps. the genes with the strongest regulations were markers for oxidative fiber types  and genes which are known to be involved in embryogenesis . the differentially expressed genes corresponded to a variety of process including morphogenesis and contraction, but also amino acid metabolism, cell cycle and immune function. finally, we found more differentially expressed genes and more overrepresented go classes under hfd conditions than under lfd conditions. however, this did not result in the identification of other regulated processes indicating that diet has only a very small effect on the difference between gastrocnemius and quadriceps.

numerous genes involved in embryogenesis are detectably expressed in adult mouse muscle tissue
one of the most interesting findings of the comparison between gastrocnemius and quadriceps was the fact that genes of the dkk family , hox family  and tbx family  were detectably expressed in adult mouse muscle tissue. to find out if also other genes from these three gene families are detectably expressed in adult mouse muscle tissue we analyzed the microarray signal intensities of all members, which were present on the microarray, in the gastrocnemius and quadriceps. an average microarray signal intensity >  <dig> was used as cut off. fig. 2a shows that four members of the dkk gene family were present on the microarray. in addition to dkk <dig>  we found that also dkk <dig> was detectably expressed in both gastrocnemius and quadriceps . from the hox family  <dig> members were present on the microarray. eight genes of the hox family, including hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig>  were expressed in adult muscle tissue. hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  hoxc <dig>  hoxc <dig>  hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> were detectably expressed in both the gastrocnemius and quadriceps. furthermore, hoxc <dig> was detectably expressed in the quadriceps and not in the gastrocnemius , whereas hoxd <dig> was detectably expressed in the gastrocnemius and not in the quadriceps . the gene with the highest expression level was identified as the hoxc <dig> gene . fig. 2c shows that from the tbx family  <dig> members were present on the microarray. additionally to tbx <dig>  we found that tbx <dig> was highly expressed in the gastrocnemius as well as in the quadriceps . altogether, these results show that some genes that are known to play an important role in embryogenesis are also detectably expressed in adult mouse muscle tissue.

the tbx <dig> gene is a muscle-type specific marker
dkk <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig> and tbx <dig> were relatively high and differentially expressed in the gastrocnemius as compared to the quadriceps of mice fed an 8-week lfd. to extrapolate our result to a third muscle type we analyzed the expression level of these genes in quadriceps, gastrocnemius and soleus muscle of 20-week lfd mice and 20-week hfd mice. none of the genes was significantly influenced by diet which is in line with the earlier described observations . hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> were highly expressed in the gastrocnemius, but low gene expression levels were observed in the quadriceps and soleus . dkk <dig> was significantly higher expressed in the quadriceps than in the gastrocnemius and soleus. although not significantly, dkk <dig> gene expression was lower in the soleus than in the gastrocnemius . the highest expression levels of the tbx <dig> gene was found in the quadriceps. intermediate expression levels were measured in the soleus and the lowest expression level was found in the gastrocnemius. the tbx <dig> expression levels between the three muscle types were all significantly different .

gene expression patterns of hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> do not correlate with expression patterns of markers for the different fiber types
we found that markers for the oxidative fiber types as well as members of the hoxd gene cluster were higher expressed in the gastrocnemius than in the quadriceps. to find out if these hoxd genes play a role in specifying more oxidative muscle types we compared genes expression levels of hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig> and markers for different fiber types  in quadriceps, gastrocnemius and soleus muscle of 20-week lfd mice and 20-week hfd mice. expression levels of markers for the different fiber types were not affected by diet. whereas hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> showed increased expression in the gastrocnemius as compared to quadriceps and soleus, expression levels of myh <dig> was significantly higher in the soleus than in the quadriceps and gastrocnemius, respectively. also the myh <dig> expression level was higher in the soleus than in the quadriceps and gastrocnemius. for both myh <dig> and myh <dig> no differences between the quadriceps and the gastrocnemius were observed. myh <dig> gene expression levels were comparable between the three muscle types. finally, the expression level of the myh <dig> gene was significantly lower in the soleus than in the quadriceps and gastrocnemius, respectively. myh <dig> gene expression levels were similar in the quadriceps and gastrocnemius . altogether, the expression patterns of hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> did not correspond with the expression patterns of one of the markers for the different fiber types.

discussion
in the present study we searched for novel genes that are involved in specifying muscle types. additionally, we studied the diet-sensitivity of differentially expressed genes. by comparing the gastrocnemius with the quadriceps we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes corresponding to a variety of biological processes. especially processes involved in cell cycle, contraction, development, differentiation, morphogenesis and remodeling were differentially regulated in the gastrocnemius vs. the quadriceps. both the gastrocnemius and the quadriceps are muscle groups that consist of predominantly type ii fibers. in the present study we found that myh <dig>  tnnc <dig>  tnni <dig> and tnnt <dig>  which are all markers for the more oxidative fiber types, are strongly up-regulated in the gastrocnemius as compared to the quadriceps. western blotting showed that protein levels of myosin heavy chain, slow fiber type protein  were similar between the gastrocnemius and the quadriceps, whereas the protein level of myh <dig>  was higher in the gastrocnemius than in the quadriceps . therefore, we propose that in this study the gastrocnemius had a more oxidative character than the quadriceps.

recently, we showed that a 4-week hfd intervention results in increased gene expression and protein levels of markers for the oxidative fiber types in the quadriceps of mice. these findings suggested that the skeletal muscle can adapt to an increased lipid load by inducing a switch to a more oxidative phenotype  <cit> . although the adult skeletal muscle is known to have the capacity to adapt to functional demands including exercise, hormones, innervation and mechanical loading  <cit> , a link between hfd and a switch of fiber type was not yet described. however, in the present study we showed that an 8-week hfd has none or only minor effects on expression levels of genes that play a role in specifying different muscle types including the markers for oxidative fiber types. therefore we speculate that the up-regulation of markers for the oxidative fiber types is an early response of the skeletal muscle to the hfd which is not maintained in the long run.

among the strongest regulated genes we found five genes  which are especially known for their critical role during embryogenesis. the skeletal muscle is a dynamic tissue containing different types of stem cells such as satellite cells, side-population  cells and muscle-derived stem cells   <cit> . to exclude the possibility that expression of these five embryogenesis-related genes originated from other cell types than myocytes we analyzed the expression of genes that specify satellite cells, sp cells and mdsc . we found that only three genes  were detectably expressed  in the skeletal muscle of these mice. however, none of these detectably expressed markers differed more than  <dig> -fold between the gastrocnemius and the quadriceps. altogether, we cannot exclude the presence of cells other than myocytes, however, it is most unlikely that these cells have contributed to the different expression levels of dkk <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig> and tbx <dig> 

two genes, dkk <dig> and tbx <dig>  were expressed at a lower level in the gastrocnemius than in the quadriceps. extrapolating our data to the soleus we found that dkk <dig> expression in the soleus was lower than in the quadriceps or gastrocnemius. interestingly, tbx <dig> expression levels in the soleus were lower than in the quadriceps, but higher than in the gastrocnemius. during embryogenesis dkk <dig> and tbx <dig> are expressed in a variety of organs including the heart and limb buds  <cit> . whereas the function of dkk <dig> is still poorly understood  <cit> , tbx <dig> is well-studied especially in relation to heart development  <cit> . recently it was shown that tbx <dig> is also involved in development of the limb buds by regulating the number of myocytes  <cit> . since further research revealed that tbx <dig> is not necessary for skeletal muscle specification, differentiation, patterning or activation of the embryonic myogenic program, this is the only described function of tbx <dig> in relation to embryonic muscle development  <cit> . both dkk <dig> and tbx <dig> are reported to be detectably expressed in the adult skeletal muscle  <cit> , but until now nothing is known about their possible function. we speculate that the relatively high expression levels of dkk <dig> and tbx <dig> in the quadriceps is involved in maintaining identity of this muscle type.

three genes of the hoxd gene cluster  were up-regulated in the gastrocnemius as compared with the quadriceps. the hox gene family consists of at least  <dig> hox genes organized in four gene clusters  which are subdivided into parallel groups numbered  <dig> to  <dig>  the major function of hox genes is the regulation of the formation of anterior-posterior patterning during embryonic development  <cit> . different groups have studied the expression levels of the hox gene family in adult tissues of human origin. they found that each tissue displays a unique combination of detectable hox gene expression levels which is altered when normal cells changes to malignant cancer cells  <cit> . thus, in addition to their critical role in embryonic development, hox genes play an important role in adult cells by controlling critical processes like cellular identity and differentiation  <cit> . houghton et al.  <cit> . have studied expression patterns of the hox gene family in skeletal muscle tissue of adult mice. in line with our observations they reported that the hoxa <dig>  hoxc <dig>  hoxc <dig> and hoxc <dig> genes were detectably expressed. furthermore, they could not detect hoxd <dig> which also is consistent with our findings. other members of the hoxd gene cluster were not studied  <cit> . thus to our knowledge, we are the first to show that hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> are detectably expressed in adult murine muscle tissue, with highly increased expression levels in the gastrocnemius as compared with the quadriceps.

together with the higher hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> gene expression levels in the gastrocnemius we found increased gene expression levels of markers for the more oxidative fiber types. therefore we hypothesized that hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> might be involved in the determination of more oxidative muscle types. however, when we extrapolated our data to the soleus muscle we could not find a corresponding expression pattern between hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig> and myh <dig>  and tnni <dig> . in fact, myh <dig> and tnni <dig> were highly expressed in the soleus, whereas hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> expression in the soleus was as low as in the quadriceps. also the expression patterns of myh <dig>  myh <dig> and myh <dig>  which are markers for type iia, iix and iib fibers, respectively, did not show any resemblance with the expression pattern of hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig>  although we did not find any resemblances between expression patterns of hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig> and any of the fiber type-specific markers we could distinguish the gastrocnemius, quadriceps and soleus from each other. altogether, we suggest that the high expression levels of the hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig> and possibly hoxd <dig> genes are a specific characteristic of the molecular profile of the gastrocnemius and are not related to an oxidative phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that especially genes that are markers for oxidative fiber types and genes known to be important for embryogenesis were differentially expressed in the gastrocnemius vs. the quadriceps. the expression levels of these genes were not influenced by diet. furthermore, expression of hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> was low and expression of dkk <dig> and tbx <dig> was high in the quadriceps. in the gastrocnemius we observed high expression of hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> and low expression of dkk <dig> and tbx <dig>  finally, in the soleus we found low expression of hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig> and dkk <dig>  but intermediate expression of tbx <dig>  comparing gastrocnemius, quadriceps and soleus, the gene expression pattern of hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> did not correspond to the gene expression pattern of any of the fiber type-specific markers. therefore, we conclude that the highly expressed embryonic genes dkk <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig> and tbx <dig> are involved in identifying muscle types in a diet-independent and fiber type-unrelated manner.
