BACKGROUND
the slc <dig> family of proteins consists of  <dig> functional members and four pseudogenes in human  <cit>  and many of the proteins belonging to the this family are presynaptic reuptake transporters. the major substrates are the monoamine neurotransmitters noradrenaline , dopamine  and serotonin , amino acids including γ-aminobutyric acid  as well as other neutral amino acids, and osmolytes such as taurine, creatine and betaine  <cit> . transporters from the slc <dig> family are secondary active transporters dependent on electrochemical na+ or h+gradients to drive the transport. na+ gradients are maintained over the plasma membrane of all cells, while h+ gradients are maintained over internal membranes such as synaptic vesicles. already in the beginning of the 1990s, the sequence of the slc6a <dig> transporter was determined by sequencing cdna from mammalian sources and was shown to have high expression exclusively in the cns. at that time, the substrate of transport was not known  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the whole slc <dig> family originally classified the members into four subgroups termed gaba, monoamine, amino acid, and the orphans  <cit> . the orphan subgroup is now known to contain transporters for neutral amino acids and is hence renamed the amino acid transporter group ii  <cit> . slc6a <dig> is most similar to slc6a <dig>  regarding sequence identities  <cit> , mrna expression  <cit> , as well as substrate profile  <cit> . the protein product of the slc6a <dig> gene is termed b0at <dig>  <cit> , which will be the notation used further in this paper. interestingly, the main difference between b0at <dig> and b0at <dig> is the subcellular localization, with b0at <dig> being localized at the plasma membrane , while b0at <dig> is known to be expressed on vesicles  <cit> .

it was recently shown by two independent groups that b0at <dig> acts as a transporter of a broad range of neutral amino acids with affinity for proline, leucine and glycine, alanine and glutamine  <cit> . however, the preference for ion coupling of b0at <dig> is arguable as one study showed that b0at <dig> is na+-dependent and cl--independent  <cit> , while another study showed b0at <dig> not to be na+dependent but rather dependent on the h+gradient maintained by the vacuolar-type h+-atpase  <cit> .

in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies, performed mainly on rat tissues, have revealed that slc6a <dig> mrna as well as the b0at <dig> protein is widely distributed throughout the cns. the transporter is found exclusively in axon terminals of most glutamatergic neurons and in a sub-population of gabaergic neurons in embryonic  <cit>  as well as adult rat brain  <cit> . a similar pattern have been suggested also in mouse  <cit>  and human  <cit> , although no comprehensive mapping have been performed in these species. the physiological function of b0at <dig>  is still unknown, although several alternatives have been suggested  <cit> . many of the amino acid transporters in the slc <dig> family are known to play important roles in several pathological conditions including obesity   <cit>  and major depression   <cit> . providing that b0at <dig> has a very similar substrate profile as b0at <dig>  but with unique expression in the synapses, we hypothesized that b0at <dig> could also play a role in depression and in the action of antidepressant drugs. given the proposed synaptic localization, b0at <dig> could possibly play a role in synaptic remodeling, a process important in the long term action of antidepressant drugs  <cit>  as well as in other functions of the nervous system.

in this context, we challenged the serotonin and the dopamine/noradrenaline systems with drugs  and studied effects on expression of slc6a <dig> and slc6a <dig> mrna in various brain regions. fluoxetine is an antidepressant drug of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  class, clinically used to treat depressive disorders, while bupropion is a noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. bupropion is used in treatment of depression as well as a smoking cessation aid, due to its actions on the reward system in the brain. we also studied slc6a <dig> and slc6a <dig> transporters in terms of their involvement in food intake control in a model of acute food deprivation and in a model for chronic food restriction, using a validated quantitative real-time pcr method. we show here that slc6a17mrna is strongly regulated under these conditions. additionally, we provide a complete view of b0at <dig>  expression in the central nervous system of mouse. we accomplished this with in situ hybridization on mouse brain and spinal cord, confirming previously shown gene expression of slc6a <dig>  we also made polyclonal b0at <dig> antibody and used immunohistochemistry to study endogenous protein expression of b0at <dig> in mouse nervous system, to identify specific cell types expressing the b0at <dig> transporter.

RESULTS
high slc6a <dig> gene expression in rat cns
expression analysis of slc6a <dig> in cns and peripheral tissues  showed widespread, multifocal expression in the rat cns and low or almost no expression in peripheral tissues. the relative expression of slc6a <dig> was highest in hindbrain , brain slice ii  and brain slice vii . slc6a17mrna was also highly expressed in the other tissues with the following relative expression; brain slice vi , brain slice v , brain slice i , brain slice iv , brain slice iii , cerebellum , spinal cord , brain slice viii , brain stem , epididymis  and hypothalamus . relative expression below 2% was seen in skeletal muscle, intestine, liver and eye, while really low expression below 1% was seen in the other peripheral tissues .

expression of slc6a <dig> mrna in mouse pomc and npy neurons, and in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons
double in situ hybridization was used to identify cell types expressing slc6a <dig> in mouse brain . proopiomelanocortin  and neuropeptide y  are expressed in adjacent subpopulations of arcuate nucleus neurons , and are known to be involved in the regulation of food intake  <cit> . our experiments demonstrated that slc6a <dig> mrna co-localized with pomc and other neurons in arc in the hypothalamus . the slc6a <dig> mrna also co-localized with npy and was also found in other neurons in arc . slc6a <dig> showed overlapping mrna expression with glutaminase, but was also found in glutaminase negative neurons in cerebral cortex . slc6a <dig> also localized to gad <dig> expressing neurons as well as other neurons in cortex . these results collectively show that slc6a <dig> is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the brain. combined in situ hybridization with immunohistochemistry was used on mouse spinal cord sections to investigate if slc6a <dig> was expressed in gfap positive  cells  <cit>  . the slc6a <dig> mrna expression was located to interneurons in the grey matter and in subsets of cholinergic motor neurons in the upper lumbar vertebrae l <dig>  co-staining with slc6a <dig> mrna and the gfap antibody did not overlap in spinal cord, suggesting no slc6a <dig> expression in astrocytes.

abundant mrna expression of slc6a <dig> in mouse brain and spinal cord
in situ hybridization with a probe against slc6a <dig> was used to evaluate expression of slc6a <dig> in mouse brain and spinal cord . the dig-labeled antisense slc6a <dig> probe was 285 bp long and directed against the last coding exon of the gene. we confirmed high levels of slc6a <dig> expression in gray but not in the white matter in the brain. high mrna expression was seen in hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, thalamus, amygdala, pons, while low expression was seen in basal ganglia and spinal cord. slc6a <dig> showed expression in the strias of cpu  and in nacc. staining was detected in septum , hippocampal grdg and py , all layers of cerebral cortex except layer  <dig> , dmh, vmh, lh and arc in hypothalamus , bla and blv in amygdala , lc and bar in pons, and in the purkinje layer of cells in cerebellum . in addition, slc6a <dig> was also highly expressed in piriform cortex. widespread slc6a <dig> mrna expression was detected in the spinal cord, where the gene was detected in subsets of somatic motor neurons and in interneurons .

specificity of the b0at <dig> antibody
we generated rabbit polyclonal b0at <dig> antibody against an epitope in the n-terminus, to verify the expression obtained with the commercially available antibody. we used immunohistochemistry to document the epitope specificity of the antibody by co-labeling it with the commercially available monoclonal mouse-b0at <dig> antibody . the immunohistochemistry with the b0at <dig> antibodies showed highly overlapping expression in mouse cns, with one exception. the commercially available b0at <dig> antibody gave staining within some cells in spinal cord which was not seen for the custom-made polyclonal b0at <dig> antibody. this could be due to the fact that different epitopes were used to generate the antibodies and that, the epitope we used is not exposed in these specific cells. it could also be due to low expression of b0at <dig> in these cells and that the mouse antibody has higher sensitivity. another possibility is that the commercial antibody is slightly less specific and hence detects another protein in these cells. this experiment verifies the specificity of both antibodies.

mouse cns localization of b0at <dig> protein in the cell body, axon and synapses of inhibitory and excitatory neurons
a number of neuronal markers were used to visualize the neuronal expression of the b0at <dig> transporter . highly overlapping expression was seen for b0at <dig> and the neuronal marker   <cit>  . the b0at <dig> expression was localized to the cell body and in the axon of neurons in cerebral cortex and also in other areas. the microtubule-associated protein  <dig>   <cit>  and b0at <dig> co-localized in the cell body of neurons in the cerebral cortex and other areas in the brain . gad <dig>  <cit>  was used to show expression of b0at <dig> in gabaergic neurons . we also used the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter viaat , a marker of synaptic vesicles in gabaergic neurons and in sets of glycinergic neurons  <cit> , and synaptophysin, a generally expressed presynaptic vesicle glycoprotein  <cit> , to investigate the vesicular localization of b0at <dig>  co-localization of b0at <dig> and viaat indicated highly overlapping expression in inhibitory synapses in hippocampus, and similar co-localization was also found in other areas of the brain and in spinal cord . b0at <dig> and synaptophysin immunoreactivity extensively overlapped in grey matter in spinal cord, and similar expression pattern was also seen in brain . as expected, the b0at <dig> transporter did not co-localize with the astrocyte marker gfap  <cit>  in hypothalamus or in other areas of the brain . interestingly, the choroid plexus epithelial cell marker pan-cytokeratin  <cit>  localized in cells surrounding the ventricles, towards the cerebrospinal fluid , while b0at <dig> was found in the same cells but on the opposite side . the protein expression of b0at <dig> and pan-cytokeratin did not overlap in the lateral ventricle  or in any of the other ventricles in brain. additionally, markers for phosphate-activated glutaminase , the enzyme which generates glutamate and ammonia from glutamine  <cit> , and vesicular glutamate transporters   <cit>  were used to investigate the expression of b0at <dig> in excitatory neurons. highly overlapping expression was seen for b0at <dig> and pag in cortex and in cells close to the 3 v in hypothalamus in the brain . moderate overlapping expression was seen for vglut <dig> and b0at <dig> in the gray matter of dorsal horn in spinal cord and in the brain , while extensively overlapping expression was seen for b0at <dig> and vglut <dig> in gray matter of ventral horn in spinal cord and in the cortex in the brain . the vglut <dig> staining shown here indicates synaptic staining as well as staining on the cell-bodies, which should be interpreted with caution as this is normally not seen and could be the result of non-specific staining. similar overlap was also seen between vglut <dig>  as well as between vglut <dig> and b0at <dig>  in the brain. to conclude, b0at <dig> is located on gabaergic and glutamatergic neurons with expression in synapses in the brain and in spinal cord.

protein interactions between b0at <dig> and synaptic vesicles and between b0at <dig> and glutaminase
the proximity ligation assay  technology was used for detection of interactions between antibodies targeting b0at <dig> and the vesicle marker , and between b0at <dig> and the glutaminase marker pag in hypothalamic mouse cells . no protein interactions were seen in the negative control . a moderate number of interactions were seen between 0b0at <dig> and synaptophysin , while a higher number of interactions was seen between b0at <dig> and pag.

cellular localization of b0at <dig> immunoreactivity in neurons and synapses in primary cell culture
immunohistochemistry was used to investigate neuronal and vesicular localization of b0at <dig> in mouse e <dig> primary cell cultures . the immunoreactivity of b0at <dig> and the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein  <dig>   <cit>  highly overlapped in the cell body close to the membrane and in the dendrites of single cells from whole brain . only cells containing large nuclei were labelled with map <dig>  while cells with smaller nuclei, representing non-neuronal cells, were not labelled with either the neuronal marker or b0at <dig>  in the next experiment, cells were grown for longer time prior to immunohistochemistry to be able to study the b0at <dig> expression in colonies of more matured cells. b0at <dig> immunofluorescence indicated expression in the neuronal axons on cells from fore brain . to further visualize the vesicular localization of b0at <dig> the vesicular marker synaptophysin  <cit>  was co-labelled with b0at <dig> on cells from fore brain. the b0at <dig> and synaptophysin proteins were highly overlapping in the cell bodies and in the axons.

up-regulation of slc6a <dig> in hypothalamus in food restricted rats
changes in expression levels of slc6a <dig> and slc6a <dig> were investigated in a model for appetite where rats were acutely food deprived for 48 hours  or 45% chronic food restricted during 12 days  and compared with an ad libitum fed control group . expression levels were studied in a number of tissues; hippocampus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray and prefrontal cortex. a significant  up-regulation was seen for slc6a <dig> in hypothalamus after short term starvation, and a trend of up-regulation was seen after long term starvation . this suggests that slc6a <dig> has a more pronounced role in anticipation of food than in appetite regulation. no significant differences in expression were seen for slc6a <dig> in any of the studied tissues , and no significant up-regulation was seen for the slc6a <dig> gene in food restricted rats.

up-regulation of slc6a <dig> and slc6a <dig> in rats treated with antidepressant drugs
the monoamine system was challenged with antidepressants to study the serotonin  and the dopamine/noradrenaline systems  . changes in mrna expression of slc6a <dig> and slc6a <dig> transporters as response to the drugs were investigated in a number of tissues . slc6a <dig> was significantly up-regulated in hippocampus independent of the dose of fluoxetine , while a trend of up-regulation was seen after bupropion treatment . bupropion injection caused a significant up-regulation of slc6a <dig> in hypothalamus  and in prefrontal cortex . no changes in gene expression were seen in amygdala and brainstem. interestingly, a similar pattern was seen for the related slc6a <dig> transporter, with up-regulation in hippocampus after injection of both doses of fluoxetine and the bupropion antidepressant  . the slc6a <dig> gene was also significantly up-regulated in prefrontal cortex after bupropion treatment .

discussion
in this study we used quantitative rt-pcr  in a large panel of adult rat brain and peripheral tissues , to further refine the expression profile of the slc6a <dig> gene. the highest expression levels of slc6a <dig> mrna were found in hindbrain, various brain cross sections, cerebellum, spinal cord, brain stem and hypothalamus, while very low or no expression was seen in the peripheral tissues with the exception of epididymis. consequently, the slc6a <dig> transporter is highly and selectively expressed in the cns of adult rat.

abundant mrna expression of slc6a <dig> in adult and embryonic rat cns has previously been shown using in situ hybridization. consistent results indicated restricted expression exclusively in neurons, both glutamatergic and subsets of gabaergic  <cit> . our results from in situ hybridization  shows that the mouse slc6a <dig> gene has similar expression pattern as previously seen in rat, with high expression in mouse forebrain and midbrain and lower expression in some parts of the hindbrain such as the basal ganglia. low mrna expression was seen in spinal cord. we confirmed slc6a17gene expression in gabaergic neurons in hippocampus, in the pyramidal and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus  <cit> , and in the purkinje cell layer of cerebellum  <cit> . the mrna expression was also found in all layers of cerebral cortex, except layer  <dig>  with strongest expression in cortical layer  <dig>  results that support expression by glutamatergic neurons  <cit> . the layer-like pattern in cortex gives strength to the conclusion that the expression is neuronal, while a scattered pattern would suggest expression in astrocytes. hybridization in sections of mouse spinal cord showed expression in subsets of somatic motor neurons and in interneurons. cortical co-localization of slc6a <dig> mrna with glutamatergic  and gabaergic  mrna markers confirmed slc6a <dig> staining in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in brain , while co-immuno labeling with the astrocyte protein marker gfap showed no overlap in spinal cord, suggesting no expression of slc6a <dig> in glial cells. the expression in piris is highly interesting as this area have been shown to be part of a possible amino acid chemo-sensing system, involved in recognition of diets with deficiency of essential amino acids, producing an anorectic response  <cit> . we also found expression of slc6a <dig> in many regions involved in homeostatic control, with pronounced hypothalamic expression specifically in vmh, dmh, lh and arc. in addition, we found expression in the amygdala , the pons , and the ventral striatum . these are all areas known to be part of the reward network and in regulation of food intake  <cit> . the slc6a <dig> mrna expression pattern in mouse cns strongly suggests that slc6a <dig> play a role in both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission and that the transporter could be involved in regulating food intake.

here, we used a custom-made mouse b0at <dig> antibody for further cellular localization of the b0at <dig> protein in mouse brain and spinal cord. immunohistological double labelling on primary cell cultures with the neuronal cell marker  and the neuronal terminal marker  visualized b0at <dig> localization to neurons, with expression both in soma and in synapses . in addition, pla studies showed protein proximity between antibodies targeting b0at <dig> and synaptophysin, a marker for synaptic vesicles, in a hypothalamic mouse cell line . localization to synapses was also confirmed with double labelling on mouse brain and spinal cord sections . gabaergic markers  were used and showed neuronal b0at <dig> localization in gabaergic neurons and in gabaergic synapses. interestingly, glutamatergic markers  showed that b0at <dig> is also localized at glutamatergic neurons and in glutamatergic synapses. direct protein interactions between b0at <dig> and pag in glutamatergic neurons were shown with pla. we further investigated whether b0at <dig> was expressed in choroid plexus, by co-staining with pan-cytokeratin to visualizethe cellular layer surrounding the ventricles of the brain. highly overlapping expression has previously been shown for b0at <dig> and the choroid plexus marker , here b0at <dig> and pan-cytokeratin did not co-localize. despite the absence of co-localization within cells, b0at <dig> still localized to the choroid plexus, but only to the brain side of choroid plexus cells. possibly, b0at <dig> and b0at <dig> function within these cells and contribute to the uptake of circulating amino acids from the blood stream into the brain. b0at <dig> has been suggested to be h+-dependent  <cit> , but another study has shown that it is na+-dependent  <cit> . our results, showing very clear expression in synapses , support that b0at <dig> is h+-driven, a feature typical for other vesicular transporters such as vgluts, viaat and vmat <cit> . however, some ihc staining presented here suggest that b0at <dig> is also found in the soma of neurons, most likely with expression in the plasma membrane. if this expression is functionally relevant, b0at <dig> is most likely utilizing the na+-gradient over the plasma membrane to drive transport. this is supported by previous studies that have shown that, transport through b0at <dig> can be driven by h+ as well as na+ gradients  <cit> .

both acute and chronic food restriction  induce activation of synaptic neurotransmission in hypothalamus, which in turn boasts a strong signal to start food seeking and consumption. starvation increases the levels of circulating ghrelin which activates neurons in hypothalamus to release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate  <cit> . glutamate can in turn activate the n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptor  <cit>  located on gabaergic neurons, also expressing npy and agrp, and hence stimulate feeding  <cit> . our results show that slc6a17mrna is highly regulated in response to starvation, suggesting that up-regulation of the transporter could be part of the enhancement of the excitatory signal during starvation , while the expression of slc6a <dig> appeared to be less affected. the effect was only seen for long term food restriction, and was not observed after acute food deprivation. up-regulation of the slc6a <dig> transporter indicates increasing uptake of amino acids into vesicles, a function that could influence a number of other mechanisms. b0at <dig> has a broad transport profile displaying, among others, uptake of glycine. of all transporters of amino acids, there are a number of known transporters, with high capacity for glycine transport , glyt <dig> , snat <dig> , pat <dig> , viaat   <cit> ), although only b0at <dig> has vesicular expression. here, we also study the mrna expression of slc6a <dig> in pomc and npy positive cells. the slc6a <dig> transporter showed localization both at hypothalamic pomc and npy neurons , which is in agreement with the possible role in body weight homeostasis.

when we challenged the 5-ht  and the da/na systems  in rats over a treatment period of fourteen days, we found significant changes in the levels of transcripts for slc6a <dig> and slc6a <dig> . administration of fluoxetine, an antidepressant of the selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitor  type, resulted acutely in an increase of 5-ht in the synaptic cleft. both slc6a <dig> and slc6a <dig> were significantly up-regulated in hippocampus after fluoxetine injections. similar stimulatory effect on hippocampal and cortex expression is observed for the vesicular glutamate transporter vglut <dig> in response to antidepressant treatment with fluoxetine, and the transporter is linked to increased 5-ht levels  <cit> . moreover, mice with reduced vglut <dig> expression show increased anxiety, depressive-like behaviors, and impaired recognition memory  <cit> . bupropion acts as a dual na and da uptake inhibitor in several mesocorticolimbic areas  <cit> . the drug inhibit the reuptake of na and da through blockage of the na transporter  and da transporter  in humans, without affecting release or transport of other neurotransmitters and without binding to other neurotransmitter receptors  <cit> . we showed that increased levels of da and na gave significant up-regulation of both slc6a <dig> and slc6a <dig> in prefrontal cortex, up-regulation of slc6a <dig> in hypothalamus and of slc6a <dig> in hippocampus. the results once again demonstrate that the expression levels of slc6a <dig> and slc6a <dig> are regulated by changes in monoamine levels. we suggest that the increase of these transporters may have a role in regulating the availability of amino acids used for neurotransmitter precursors. the slc6a <dig> results are supported by results from a previous study by kohli et al. <cit>  where slc6a <dig> was associated with major depression. here it was found, in a whole genome association study, that allelic variants of slc6a <dig> increased the risk of acquiring major depression, although the mechanism behind this is not known. antidepressant drugs are thought to acutely increase the levels of 5-ht and na/da in the brain but, in long term antidepressant drugs, it has been shown to induce remodeling of neuronal circuits by strengthening of synapses  <cit> , involving both glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons and possibly slc6a <dig> and slc6a <dig> could play a role in these long term effects. it is also known that starvation induces glutamatergic signaling in pomc neurons of the hypothalamus and it is possible that b0at <dig> enhances the signaling capabilities of glutamatergic neurons. b0at <dig> is unique among the slc <dig> family of proteins in that sense that it is expressed on vesicles rather than on the plasma membrane. b0at <dig> has been shown to transport, among other amino acids, glycine. glycine has at least two important functions in glutamatergic neurotransmission; first, glycine can be used for the synthesis of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, and secondly, glycine is a necessary co-factor for the ability of glutamate to activate nmda receptors  <cit> . the up-regulation of the slc6a <dig> transporter after long term food restriction and activating drugs suggests the transporter to be involved in the increased glutamatergic signaling. it is possible that b0at <dig> provides a mechanism to enhance nmda receptor activation, possibly providing stronger ltp response, by packing glycine into glutamate containing vesicles and hence increase the local concentration of glycine in the synaptic cleft.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we provide an extensive localization study of b0at <dig>  in mouse nervous system. we show that b0at <dig> is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with high expression in synapses, although we also see expression in the somato-dendritic part of neurons. we show that b0at <dig> expression is highly overlapping with viaat and vglut <dig> expression, and to a lesser extent with vglut <dig>  we also demonstrate that slc6a17mrna is highly regulated by administration of drugs targeting the 5-ht system and the dopamine and noradrenaline systems as well as during periods of starvation.
