BACKGROUND
a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including alzheimer's disease  have been proposed to involve a dysregulation in the brain's glutamatergic system  <cit> . in addition, high  glutamate concentrations have been documented to cause neuronal degeneration in various in vivo and in vitro models  <cit> . although glutamate-induced cell death is associated with both apoptotic and necrotic changes  <cit>  the mechanism of cell death remains to be established.

two distinct pathways for glutamate-induced cell death have been described: the excitotoxic pathway and the oxidative pathway. the excitotoxic pathway involves the overactivation of glutamate receptors that leads to both rapid and slowly triggered cytotoxic events. the rapid effects involve the activation of the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor  that lead to a large ca2+ influx that may be detrimental to cell viability  <cit> . the oxidative pathway involves the breakdown of the glutamate-cystine antiporter and a drop in glutathione levels that allows for aberrant formation of reactive oxygen species  that are neurotoxic  <cit> .

although intracellular ca2+  is necessary for a number of physiological processes, excessive amounts may lead to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. neuronal increases in ca2+ can activate a number of enzymes, such as phospholipases, proteases, endonucleases and nitric oxide synthase . increase in the activity of these enzymes is associated with neuronal cell death  <cit> . excessive glutamatergic stimulation is also associated with an increase in i required for neuronal nos  activation and nitric oxide  production within the neuron and this can result in increased cell death  <cit> . therefore, the maintenance of proper ca2+ homeostasis may be effective in preventing the progression of glutamate associated neuronal degeneration.

previous studies demonstrate that estrogens are neuroprotective against the oxidative pathway of glutamate-induced cell death in a mouse hippocampal cell line, ht <dig>  <cit> . this finding, along with other studies describing estrogen's neuroprotective and neurotrophic action  <cit>  support results from observational studies that exogenous estrogen use by postmenopausal women is neuroprotective  <cit> .

although estrogens are potent antioxidants  <cit>  that can prevent oxidative damage in cell culture systems, recent evidence also suggests that estrogen may inhibit glutamate-induced excitotoxicity  <cit> . moreover, estrogen can lower cytotoxic ca2+ influxes induced by glutamate in hippocampal cells  <cit> . whether this ca2+ lowering, or buffering effect occurs in other neuronal cell types, such as cortical cells, that are known to be estrogen sensitive, and whether this effect is involved in estrogen's neuroprotective effects remains to be established.

in this study, the effect of 17β-estradiol  and a novel ring-b unsaturated equine estrogen with less feminizing effects  <cit>  and greater antioxidant potential, Δ <dig>  17β-estradiol   <cit>  on cell viability and i, following treatment of rat cortical cells with glutamate was studied. the concentrations of glutamate used in the present study are relatively lower than those used in previous studies where cell death may have occurred mainly via the oxidative pathway. it is hypothesized that both estrogens will protect cortical cells from glutamate induced excitotoxicity by modifying the initial ca2+ influx in addition to acting as antioxidants.

RESULTS
purity of neuronal cultures
freshly isolated embryonic cortical cells obtained from day 17– <dig> pregnant rats were cultured and maintained in serum-free neurobasal medium containing b <dig> supplements for  <dig> days as described under "materials and methods". phase contrast microscopy indicated that the cells had characteristic morphology of neurons and their cellular extensions  were clearly visible . immunocytochemistry using anti-rat neuronal specific enolase , and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein  indicates, as can be seen in figure 1a and figure 1c, that the cells stained positively only for neuronal enolase  while gfap staining  was not detectable. these data further indicate that almost all cells seen by phase-contrast microscopy  were positive for neuronal enolase . thus, the cultures used in our studies are purely neuronal.

effect of glutamate on cell viability
cortical neuronal cells  cultured for  <dig> days in 96-well plates were treated with increasing concentrations  of glutamate for  <dig> min and cell viability was measured after  <dig> hrs and compared with vehicle-treated samples. as depicted in figure  <dig>   <dig>  to  <dig> μm glutamate resulted in minimal cell death. as the amount of glutamate increased between  <dig> to  <dig> μm, the cell death increased gradually in a dose-dependent manner. thus, treatment with  <dig> μm glutamate and  <dig> μm glutamate decreased cell viability by  <dig>   ±  <dig> % and  <dig> ±  <dig> % respectively. higher concentrations  of glutamate did not result in any further decrease in cell viability . thus cell death induced by acute glutamate treatment reached a plateau in these rat primary cortical cells with concentrations of glutamate between  <dig> and  <dig> μm. for all subsequent experiments  <dig> μm glutamate was used to induce cell death and this concentration resulted in a mean cell death of  <dig>  ±  <dig> %.

kinetics of glutamate-induced cell death
in order to determine the kinetics of glutamate excitotoxicity, rat primary cortical neurons were cultured for  <dig> days and then treated with  <dig> μm glutamate for  <dig> min. cell death was then assessed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs as described under "materials and methods".

the results depicted in figure  <dig> indicated that acute glutamate treatment resulted in a time-dependent increase in ldh release compared to vehicle treated cells. measurement of ldh release at  <dig> hours resulted in no observable difference in ldh release compared to vehicle treated samples, however after  <dig> hours, an increase in ldh release of  <dig> ±  <dig> %  compared to control was observed. at  <dig> hours ldh release increased by  <dig> ±  <dig> %  over control. no significant increase in ldh release was observed thereafter . the change in ldh release ratio between glutamate and the control cells at  <dig> hours  compared to  <dig> hrs  was not statistically significant. thus, it appears that the majority of cell death in rat primary cortical cells from acute glutamate exposure occurred between  <dig> to  <dig> hours post glutamate treatment.

effect of estrogen on glutamate-induced cell death
to determine whether the neurotoxic effect of glutamate can be prevented by estrogen treatment, cells were pretreated for  <dig> hrs with various concentrations,  <dig>  to  <dig> μm, of 17β-e <dig> or Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig>  glutamate treatment was then initiated and cell viability was measured after  <dig> hrs. an acute ,  <dig> μm glutamate exposure resulted in a 50% decrease in cell viability. as depicted in figure  <dig>  pretreatment with 17β-e <dig> or Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> for  <dig> hrs resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cell viability against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. no significant protection was observed with  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm 17β-e <dig>  however,  <dig>  to  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> resulted in a  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % increase in protection  respectively. similarly, pretreatment with  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> resulted in an increase in protection from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % respectively, however, statistical significance at these concentrations was not reached. in contrast, pretreatment with  <dig> and  <dig> μm Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> resulted in a significant  increase in protection of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % respectively . higher concentration  of both estrogens did not result in any further increase in protection. although both 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> were able to significantly reduce the glutamate-induced cell death complete protection was not achieved with the concentrations tested. however, the results do indicate that 17β-e <dig> was more effective in preventing glutamate-induced cell death than Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig>  and this was found to be significant with the  <dig>  to  <dig> μm concentrations of estrogen tested . pretreatment of cells with estrogen for  <dig> minutes did not protect the cells against glutamate neurotoxicity, .

effect of nmda and nos inhibitors on glutamate-induced cell death
to determine whether the neurotoxic effect of acute glutamate treatment on rat primary cortical neurons is mediated through the nmdar or no, cell viability was determined following inhibition of nmdar function or inhibition of nos activity in cells treated acutely with  <dig> μm glutamate. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  a  <dig> minute exposure with  <dig> μm glutamate in rat primary cortical cells resulted in a  <dig>  ±  <dig> % decrease in cell viability compared to the vehicle treated control . a  <dig> minute pretreatment with  <dig>  μm mk- <dig>  a non-specific antagonist of the nmdar, completely prevented cell death  compared to glutamate alone treated samples. similarly, a  <dig> minute pretreatment with  <dig> mm nos inhibitor l-name also completely prevented the cell death induced by glutamate  compared to glutamate alone treated samples. these results clearly indicate that cell death induced by glutamate involves both nmdar and no.

effect of glutamate on intracellular calcium levels
to evaluate the effect of glutamate on i concentrations in cortical neurons various glutamate concentrations, , were added to wells and changes in relative fluorescence units  were recorded. baseline readings were taken every  <dig> seconds for a total of  <dig> seconds prior to an injection  of glutamate into each well . readings were continued for another  <dig> minutes post-injection. the kinetics of glutamate induced ca2+ influx are depicted in figure 6a, and as can be seen, glutamate treatment  results in a rapid increase in i with all concentrations of glutamate  tested. this initial rapid rise in i occurs at  <dig> seconds after glutamate addition and is followed by a reduced rate of ca2+ influx. the kinetics of glutamate-induced ca2+ influx following the initial rise in i remain relatively stable, but are elevated at glutamate concentration between  <dig>  and  <dig> μm. however, at higher glutamate concentration , i continues to increase following the initial rise in i. in addition, glutamate treatment results in a dose dependent increase in the initial rise in i levels measured at  <dig> seconds, and reaches significance  with  <dig>  μm to  <dig> μm glutamate . maximal i levels were observed with  <dig> μm glutamate and further increase in glutamate concentration did not result in any further increase in i .

effect of nmdar antagonist, mk- <dig>  on glutamate-induced ca2+ influx
in order to evaluate the contribution of glutamate-induced ca2+ influx on cell viability the effect of nmdar antagonist mk- <dig> on ca2+ influx and cell viability was measured  <dig> hours later in the same cell population after glutamate treatment. the maximum initial ca2+ influx was reached  <dig> seconds after glutamate  injection and percent of maximum initial ca2+ influx was calculated for each concentration of mk- <dig> . as can be seen in figure  <dig>  a  <dig> minute pretreatment with  <dig>  to  <dig> μm mk- <dig> resulted in a significant dose-dependent reduction in the initial  ca2+ influx by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % respectively. thus, between  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm mk- <dig>  the concentration of i drops from an initial high level of  <dig> nm  at  <dig> seconds to  <dig> nm . this drop in ca2+ influx was associated with a dose-dependent increase in cell viability compared to glutamate alone . mk- <dig> mediated protection reached significance  with  <dig>  μm mk- <dig> and  <dig>  μm -  <dig> μm mk- <dig>  completely prevented glutamate-induced cell death .

effect of estrogen on glutamate-induced calcium influx
the effect of estrogen on acute, glutamate  induced ca2+ influx was measured at various concentrations  of 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig>  representative traces for the effect of  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> on the glutamate-induced ca2+ influx are presented in figure  <dig>  baseline i measurements were made every  <dig> seconds for a total of  <dig> seconds and measurements were continued every  <dig> seconds following glutamate addition . as shown in figure  <dig>  prior to glutamate addition ilevels were below  <dig> nm and remained relatively constant. addition of  <dig> μm glutamate resulted in an immediate increase in concentration of i to levels above  <dig> nm . pretreatment with  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> or Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> was not associated with any significant decrease in the levels of i induced by glutamate . however, pretreatment with estrogens resulted in a significant  but modest increase  in cell protection compared to glutamate alone. similarly, no effect on the initial glutamate induced ca2+ influx was observed at all other concentrations  of estrogen. these results indicate that protection against glutamate-induced cell death in rat primary cortical neuronal cells by estrogen does not involve a reduction in the glutamate-induced, nmdar associated, ca2+ influx, and thus estrogen mediated protection appears to be mediated by a ca2+ independent mechanism.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrate that in primary cultures of pure rat embryonic cortical neurons, acute  treatment with glutamate results in a dose and time-dependent cell death. over 50% of cells die at a glutamate concentration of  <dig> μm. higher concentrations  of glutamate did not result in any further increase in cell death. these findings are in keeping with previous observations with cultures of purified embryonic rat spinal cord motor neurons where nmda and non-nmda glutamate receptor agonists kill a maximum of 40% of the neurons  <cit> . in contrast to these findings some studies with immortalized hippocampal cells  cultured in media containing serum have reported glutamate-induced cell death to occur only at concentrations in the millimolar range  <cit> . taken together, these findings suggests that the cell type and culture conditions may play an important role in the sensitivity of cells towards glutamate-induced cell death. in addition, a main difference between rat primary cortical neuronal cells and the ht <dig> cells used, is that the ht <dig> cells are devoid of functional nmdars and thus the cell death induced in these cells at high concentrations of glutamate is thought to proceed mainly through the oxidative pathway rather than the excitotoxic pathway  <cit> .

although the primary cortical neurons used in our study are sensitive to small changes in glutamate concentrations , the extent of neuronal death under our experimental conditions  is lower than that reported in a number of studies where mixed cell cultures containing neuronal, glial and other cell types were used. in these mixed cultures over 85% of motor neurons died following treatment with glutamate  <cit> . it has further been demonstrated that in such mixed cell cultures, glutamate receptor agonists may induce cell death by activating receptors on the susceptible neurons or by activating receptors in non-neuronal cells. this results in the release of substances such as no that are toxic to neurons  <cit> . thus, the lower extent  of cell death observed in cultures maintained in neurobasal medium containing b <dig> supplements is most likely due to the high purity  of the neuronal cultures used in our study. the absence of glia in our neuronal cultures  maintained in serum free neurobasal medium and b <dig> supplements has also been reported in a number of earlier studies  <cit> .

alternatively, it is also possible that the lower extent of cell death after a short  exposure to excitotoxic levels of glutamate  may be due to the presence of glutamate sensitive and insensitive neurons in our cultures and this has also been reported by others  <cit> . it has further been demonstrated in pure motor neuronal cultures  that survival  of a subset of neurons treated with glutamate was unlikely to be due to the lack of differential glutamate receptor expression  <cit> . these authors further suggest that selective vulnerability may be down stream of the rise in intracellular ca2+ that occurs after treatment with glutamate or agonists  <cit> .

previous studies, in particular with mixed cortical cultures or spinal cord neurons, have indicated that the age or maturation of neurons is important in the extent of neuronal death following treatment with glutamate. thus, in mixed  <dig> day old cultures of neurons, glutamate treatment resulted in over 80% neuronal cell death compared to only 25% cell death in  <dig> day old cultures  <cit> . since we have used cortical neurons that have been maintained in culture for only  <dig> days, it is possible that the extent of neuronal cell death induced by glutamate may further increase in longer-term cultures. although we have been able to maintain some neurons for longer periods than one week, these neurons, even in the absence of glutamate, continue to die at variable rates. in keeping with our observations, fryer et al  <cit>  reported that 95% of pure motor neurons in culture die by  <dig> days. it appears that long-term cultures of pure neurons maintained in absence of serum cannot at present be used to address the question of the effect of glutamate on neurons maintained in culture for extended periods of time.

the kinetics of glutamate-induced cell death indicated that while an acute  exposure to glutamate was sufficient to cause cell death, cell death did not occur until  <dig> to  <dig> hours following glutamate treatment. this delay in cell death is suggestive of apoptosis. indeed, recent evidence indicates that apoptotic mechanisms can play an important role in glutamate-induced neuronal cell death  <cit> . thus, we have demonstrated in ht <dig> mouse hippocampal cells that glutamate induced apoptosis was associated with dna fragmentation, morphological changes and up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein bax and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  moreover, this process was reversed by estrogens  <cit> . we have further shown that in primary cortical neurons glutamate-induced apoptosis by caspase- <dig> dependent and independent mechanisms involves mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor  and these apoptotic changes were reversed by equine estrogens  <cit> .

while the mechanism of glutamate-induced cell death has not been fully elucidated, results from the present study clearly indicate that glutamate-induced cell death in primary cortical cells is nmdar and nos linked. the relatively short time required for glutamate to initiate the cell death process and the requirement for nmdar activation and no production, suggest that this cell death is primarily excitotoxic. these findings are in keeping with previous observations that suggest excitotoxic cell death in cortical cultures is dependent on nmdar and nos activity  <cit> . furthermore, it has been suggested that it is the production of onoo- from increased no formation that may be responsible for cell death and that this increase in no is dependent on nmda associated ca2+ influx  <cit> . therefore, reduction in ca2+ influx or no production are two potential mechanisms by which neuroprotective agents may act.

the data from the present study clearly indicates that estrogen can protect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in primary cortical cells and a  <dig> hour pretreatment prior to glutamate insult is sufficient to provide this protection. in a previous study  <cit>  protective effects of 17β-e <dig> were observed at physiological concentrations, while the concentrations we used were pharmacological. the differences are most likely due to culture conditions used: their media  <cit>  contained antioxidants, higher cell density and lower glutamate concentrations. since estrogens are potent antioxidants  <cit> , the presence of other antioxidants in the media may explain the differences between our findings and those reported previously  <cit> . although the concentrations of estrogen used in our study are high, significantly high levels  were found in postmenopausal women taking a single therapeutic dose of conjugated equine estrogen  <cit> . whether the levels used in the present study are attained in women taking these estrogens daily for extended periods of time remains to be determined.

it has been previously suggested that the antioxidant property of estrogen may be one possible mechanism by which estrogens exert their neuroprotective activity. therefore, if estrogen mediated neuroprotection occurs solely through an antioxidant mechanism, then Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig>   <cit>  would be expected to be much more effective in preventing glutamate-induced cell death than 17β-e <dig>  however, in the present study 17β-e <dig> was significantly more potent than Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig>  the difference in neuroprotective potency suggests that the protective effect under the experimental conditions used in the present study are not solely dependent on the estrogen's antioxidant potency. the difference may also be due to the experimental design used in the present study . although Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> is less potent than 17β-e <dig>  its use as a potential neuroprotective agent warrants further investigation. this estrogen is a weaker uterotropic estrogen than 17β-e <dig> and its effects appear to be mediated mainly via the estrogen receptor β   <cit> . thus, Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> may have therapeutic applications in both women and men for prevention of neurodegeneration. whether this neuroprotection also occurs through the well characterized genomic mechanism involving ers  or through the putative membrane receptor pathways  <cit>  remains to be investigated.

as we have shown, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity is dependent on nmdar activity and therefore, changes in ca2+ influx across the cell membrane may trigger mechanisms involved in cell death  <cit> . indeed, it was observed in the present study that following glutamate stimulation, a rapid dose-dependent increase in i occurs that is associated with a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability. however, stimulation with glutamate above  <dig> μm did not further increase i again suggesting that glutamate insensitive and sensitive cells may have been present in these primary cortical cultures.

the observation that glutamate-induced ca2+ influx decreased significantly by mk- <dig> suggests that this to some extent occurs via nmdar. increasing concentrations of mk- <dig> resulted in a gradual lowering of the i concentration within  <dig> seconds after glutamate treatment. thus mk- <dig>  reduced the i from  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm in  <dig> seconds . although the fall in i levels between  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm mk- <dig> was less than 5% , the cell viability increased from 58% to 100%, . these types of glutamate-induced small changes in i that result in large  and significant cell death of cortical/glial cell cultures have been previously observed  <cit> . these investigators explained this by suggesting the presence of a critical ca2+ "threshold". they further suggested that even a small reduction in nmda receptor activation may be sufficient to reduce ca2+ influx below this critical threshold such that neural cell death is significantly reduced. our results  indicate that perhaps such a threshold may also be present in pure neuronal cortical cells.

in the present study the effect of estrogen on excitotoxic ca2+ influx was investigated and although 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> both provided significant protection , neither had any effect on the glutamate-induced ca2+influx contrary to our working hypothesis. thus it appears that the estrogen mediated protection of primary cortical cells from acute glutamate exposure does not involve a decrease in the glutamate-induced ca2+ influx, and to our knowledge this is a first such observation. in contrast to these findings a previous study in hippocampal cells cultured in media containing antioxidants, has shown that estrogen can reduce the glutamate-induced ca2+ influx by increasing mitochondrial sequestration of ca2+  <cit> . this increased sequestration was attributed to the ability of estrogen to increase bcl- <dig>  an antiapoptotic protein that is important in mitochondrial ca2+ sequestration  <cit> . whether estrogen modulates bcl- <dig> expression in primary cortical cells in a manner similar to our previous study with ht <dig> cells  <cit>  or whether mitochondrial sequestration of ca2+ occurs remains to be established. furthermore, these investigators  <cit>  cultured the hippocampal cells in medium that contained antioxidants and this may also explain some of the differences observed. our results do however, indicate that the mechanism by means of which mk- <dig> and estrogens protect against glutamate-induced cell death, appears to be different. further studies are needed to identify these differences.

there are many other effects of estrogen on the central nervous system that have been described, for example, estrogen can alter nos expression throughout the brain and potentially upregulate antioxidant proteins through cyclic guanosine monophosphate linked mechanisms  <cit> . such alterations may play a role in glutamate excitotoxicity by affecting subsequent events in the cell death pathway, downstream of the initial ca2+ influx. in addition, the rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase  by estrogen has been shown to be necessary for estrogenic protection although how and what the function of mapk is in preventing cell death remains to be established  <cit> . similarly, the phosphorylation of creb  and upregulation of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor  <cit> , may play a role in neuronal protection  <cit> . whether these factors are involved in prevention of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity by equine estrogens remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
glutamate-induced cell death in cortical cultures occurs through nmdar and nos-linked mechanisms, presumably through elevated i levels that activate nos and increase the levels of no and subsequently onoo-free radicals. equine estrogens, 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig>  significantly protect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity through a mechanism that is independent of ca2+. this is to our knowledge a first such observation. whether a decrease in nos related products, such as onoo-, may be one mechanism by which estrogen provides neuroprotection against glutamate toxicity, remain to be investigated.
