BACKGROUND
bacteria are capable of living in and adapting to a far larger range of environmental conditions than are normally encountered in the usual laboratory environments. even with full knowledge of an organism's gene content, it is currently impossible to predict how expression patterns will change in different situations. thus, usual laboratory growth conditions may not invoke key aspects of an organism's potential response and thereby such studies may conceal behaviors that in a different environment may contribute to undesirable phenomena such as pathogenesis. one such case is the low-shear, low-turbulence environments present in utero, at the brush border microvilli of epithelial cells, and other medically important host environments  <cit> .

research in this medically important host environment has been greatly aided by the development of high aspect rotating vessel  bioreactors, which can produce a unique low-shear modeled microgravity  environment. the solid body rotation of the harv was designed to randomize the gravity vector and minimize the effect of fluid shear on the surface of the cell when rotated in the plane of gravity, producing the lsmmg environment  <cit> . to obtain the solid body rotation, the harv device is completely filled to prevent gas bubbles, which cause solution turbulence  and associated shear. this type of lsmmg environment has been investigated extensively with mammalian cellular systems as it also mimics several aspects of the environment encountered during space flight  <cit> . a harv bioreactor rotated perpendicular to the plane of gravity was employed as a control for maintaining a constant gravity vector and cell surface shear from settling. the application of harv bioreactors as an analogue for medical and space environments, as well as the benefits and constraints imposed by rotating bioreactors, has been described in detail in a review by nickerson et al.  <cit> .

bacterial physiology in harv grown cultures, used in conjunction with commercially available functional genomic technology, makes it possible to study the microbial responses to lsmmg at the genomic level. a recent study has shown that lsmmg grown salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  displayed increased virulence in a murine model system, as well as an increased ability to withstand antimicrobial defenses of host macrophages, and an increased resistance to acid stress. this strain had  <dig> proteins down-regulated in lsmmg compared to the normal gravity vector control  <cit> . a follow-up study revealed  <dig> genes transcriptionally regulated in response to lsmmg  <cit> . the changes seen in s. typhimurium in response to lsmmg, compared to an environment with gravity-induced shear, illustrate the potential for medically significant bacterial responses in non-standard host environments.

based on the previous work in s. typhimurium  <cit> , we herein describe a broader comparison of escherichia coli mg <dig> to determine the effect of medium on global gene regulation and physiology allowing identification of medium independent lsmmg responses and gene regulation. e. coli mg <dig> was chosen as a model system for comparison to s. typhimurium based on: the availability of the complete genomic sequence  <cit> , commercially produced genomic arrays, a well-characterized knowledge of e. coli's metabolism and gene regulation  <cit>  and it's genomic sequence similarity to s. typhimurium  <cit> . more is known about e. coli and s. typhimurium than about any other forms of cellular life and they resemble each other closely, both being gram-negative rods of the family enterobacteriaceae  <cit> .

our analysis of e. coli mg <dig> in lsmmg encompassed physiology, stress resistance and transcriptional analysis in both rich and minimal medium. this facilitated comparison to the rich medium lsmmg responses previously reported in s. typhimurium  <cit> . functional genomic macro-array analysis of lsmmg and control samples was employed to identify the lsmmg responsive genes and operons present in e. coli mg <dig>  for this analysis, the mid-log phase of growth was selected for rna harvest with subsequent functional genomic analysis because it is a comparable physiological state between experimental replicates  <cit> . the responses of e. coli mg <dig> to the unique lsmmg environment present in harv bioreactors were compared to those seen in the closely related bacteria s. typhimurium  <cit> . we had hoped to identify related responses and transcriptional regulation in common between e. coli and s. typhimurium, possibly indicating gram-negative bacterial adaptation systems which react to lsmmg. the e. coli mg <dig> lsmmg data presented in this report did not permit identification of common bacterial response systems and indicated instead species  specific responses and/or medium dependent responses to lsmmg.

RESULTS
lsmmg grown e. coli mg <dig> physiology
the lag time for lsmmg and the control cultures in lb was  <dig> ±  <dig> minutes and  <dig> ±  <dig> minutes, respectively. as expected, the lag phase in minimal mops medium was longer than that seen in lb medium, with the lsmmg and control mops cultures having lag phases of  <dig> ±  <dig> minutes and  <dig> ±  <dig> minutes, respectively. e. coli exponential growth in minimal mops medium was similar between lsmmg and the control with maximum average doubling times of  <dig>  ±  <dig> minutes and  <dig>  ±  <dig> minutes, respectively. in contrast in rich lb medium, growth in lsmmg was slower than the control with doubling times of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  minutes respectively. in rich medium, elapsed time between culture inoculation & rna harvest was highly reproducible, with both lsmmg and  <dig> × g control samples reaching an od <dig> =  <dig>  at  <dig> +/-  <dig> minutes. in minimal medium, lsmmg and  <dig> × g control samples reached an od <dig> =  <dig>  for rna harvest at  <dig> +/-  <dig> minutes. growth curves are provided as additional materials 

medium physiochemical composition during growth
initially, there was concern that changes in gene expression were caused by physiochemical differences between lsmmg and control cultures. slight variations of medium components such as o <dig> can produce extremely divergent cellular responses  <cit> . component analysis of both lb and mops medium was performed to analyze o <dig>  co <dig> and glucose concentrations as well as medium ph during harv culture growth. harv o2-concentration in rich medium, both lsmmg and control, dropped by  <dig> ±  <dig> %. in minimal medium, o <dig> content decreased by  <dig> ±  <dig> % in both growth conditions. the level of co <dig> in mops cultures remained immeasurably low, but the faster growing rich medium cultures accumulated co <dig> in a comparable manner in both samples. physiochemical analysis revealed no significant difference in ph, o <dig>  co <dig>  and glucose concentrations between lsmmg and the control in either rich lb or minimal mops medium.

stress survival analysis
previous reports had revealed that short term exposure to lsmmg enhanced thermal and acidic stress resistances in s. typhimurium and enhanced osmotic and acid stress resistances in e. coli ams <dig>  <cit> . for comparison to these organisms and to determine if lsmmg enhanced the survival capabilities of e. coli mg <dig>  antibiotic resistance and stress survival assays in both rich and minimal medium were performed. unlike s. typhimurium and e. coli ams <dig>  no significant differences in e. coli mg <dig> antibiotic resistances or stress survivals between lsmmg and the control were identified in this analysis. the detailed data is included on the project web site  <cit>  and here as supplementary material . a preliminary experiment with e. coli mg <dig> grown in the presence of ampicillin also indicated no apparent growth effect in lsmmg.

functional genomic analysis of mops lsmmg grown e. coli cultures
statistical analysis identified  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes in lsmmg  compared to the control during the mid-log phase of growth in minimal mops medium. of these,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes coded for hypothetical proteins. among the up-regulated genes of known or putative function in lsmmg are genes involved in the e. coli acid tolerance response , flg and fli genes involved in cell motility  <cit> , chemotaxis regulating genes, chez and tar  <cit> , and the phage related gene ydfd  <cit>  .

among the mops lsmmg down-regulated genes  were five genes associated with heavy metal efflux   <cit> . other lsmmg down-regulated genes included four putative bacteriaphage lambda homologs  <cit> ,  <dig> genes involved in various stress responses  <cit> , the drug resistance gene emre  <cit> , and the acetylcoa carboxylase subunit accb  <cit>  . two of the mops lsmmg down-regulated genes  were regulators. cpxp serves as repressor of the cpx envelope/extracytoplasmic toxicity stress response system  <cit> , protects the cell from toxic, transitory stresses  <cit> , is involved in adhesion and virulence of pathogenic e. coli  <cit> , and may also act as a periplasmic chaperone  <cit> . yfia stabilizes 30s rrna under cold shock conditions  <cit> . possible co-transcribed genes of putative operons were identified based on genomic location and orientation . physical mapping of the lsmmg mops regulated genes found  <dig> of  <dig> genes in  <dig> gene clusters with the remaining regulated genes distributed throughout the e. coli genome .

functional genomic analysis of rich media lsmmg e. coli mg <dig> cultures
statistical analysis employing all of the criteria described above on the lb lsmmg cultures only identified  <dig> down-regulated genes in lsmmg compared to the control . the extremely low number of lb lsmmg regulated genes, for later comparison to s. typhimurium  led us to consider additional genes that met the criteria of a p-value <  <dig>  and >  <dig> standard deviations of expression in only  <dig> of the  <dig> lb biological replicates with similar expression in the 3rd replicate . under this reduced stringency, the carboxyl transferase subunit gene acca was found to be up-regulated in lb lsmmg   <cit> .

e. coli lb lsmmg down-regulated genes, that met the significance criteria in all  <dig> lb biological replicates  were mostly involved in biosynthesis and energy utilization. down-regulated rrna associated genes included six 50s and three 30s ribosomal protein genes  <cit>  and the rimm gene required for 16s rrna processing  <cit> . additional lb lsmmg down-regulated genes included genes involved in energy production or catabolism , the ribose transporter rbsd, the trna methyltransferase trmd  <cit> , and the orf ypjd. putative operons were identified  and physical mapping revealed  <dig> of  <dig> genes in  <dig> gene clusters .

transcriptional comparison of mops and lb grown e. coli mg <dig> cultures
no genes were identified that responded in the same manner to lsmmg in both minimal mops and rich lb medium . this remained true even under reduced statistical stringency.

rt-pcr of selected lsmmg regulated genes
reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction  of selected genes was performed to verify the differential expression seen on arrays between lsmmg and the control in both mops minimal and rich lb medium . rt-pcr primers were developed to specifically amplify lsmmg responding genes identified in the genomic array analysis. all of the rt-pcr results, for operons hdeab and flgbcde , tdcdefg  and rpsf-prib-rpsr-rpli , are consistent with the whole genome array data and support the lsmmg induced transcriptional regulation described above .

promoter search analysis
a manual examination of putative transcriptional regulator binding sites upstream of lsmmg regulated genes and operons  did not reveal any conserved sequence motifs potentially regulated by lsmmg.

discussion
hybridization arrays revealed reproducible transcriptional differences when cultures grown on either rich or minimal media in the harv bioreactor in lsmmg were compared to the control orientation. in order to eliminate the technical variation caused by array versus array and spot vs. spot difference, an experimental plan was designed in such way that every control and experiment was performed using the same physical microarray. such a design has all the advantages of the two color microarrays and allows one after normalization to perform analysis of the changes  in the expression signals between control and experiment for each individual spot on the microarray. rigorous statistical criteria were applied to determine which genes were significantly up or down regulated in the individual experiments. a separate statistical analysis of the false positive rate was undertaken and this rate was less than two genes in the worse case. direct examination of relative mrna levels by rt-pcr confirmed the array results.

measurement of harv o <dig> concentration during e. coli mg <dig> growth indicated that while o <dig> content decreased inversely to culture density, it never approached anaerobic conditions. in addition, comparisons of o <dig> concentrations between lsmmg and the control did not differ during growth in either minimal mops or rich lb medium . differences in ph, co <dig>  and minimal mops medium glucose concentrations between lsmmg and the control were also not statistically distinguishable . thus, these factors are unlikely to account for observed differences in transcription that are seen in lsmmg compared to control cells.

culture growth kinetics were used to determine if lsmmg altered e. coli mg <dig> physiology in a growth dependent manner  <cit> . it is noteworthy that while e. coli mg <dig> responds to lsmmg at the level of transcriptional regulation, cellular physiology was only affected in rich lb medium where a decreased exponential growth rate compared to the control was observed. this is in contrast to s. typhimurium, where rich medium growth rates were largely unchanged and the minimal medium lsmmg doubling time was 25– <dig> minutes faster than the control  <cit> .

the primary differences between the lsmmg environment and the control are the randomized gravity vector and low shear present in lsmmg. in attempting to interpret the differences seen, one must consider that they might be due to either or both of these factors or as an indirect effect of one or both. if a direct response to gravity were occurring, one would, for example, expect the effect to be repeated in all growth or media conditions in which the gravity vector was randomized. the results presented here instead identify only medium specific e. coli mg <dig> genes that are either up- or down-regulated in the lsmmg environment.

in minimal mops medium, chemotactic and flagellar genes  as well as genes involved in the e. coli acid tolerance response  <cit>  were up-regulated in lsmmg. the reason for up-regulation of acid tolerance response genes in lsmmg grown e. coli mg <dig> remains unclear, but it is noteworthy that lsmmg grown s. typhimurium has an increased resistance to acid shock  <cit>  that is not seen in e. coli mg <dig>  it is attractive to theorize that the lsmmg up-regulation of flagellar and chemotactic genes in minimal medium is related to a cellular requirement for relocation away from zones of local nutrient depletion and excreted waste hypothesized to occur in the low mixing environment of space  <cit> . however, no data was collected to address the question of whether or not an increase in actual motility occurred. thus, although this is an attractive hypothesis, the presence of these zones in harv produced lsmmg and whether or not e. coli mg <dig> is responding to these zones by up-regulating flagellar and the chemotactic genes requires further study. the majority of minimal medium lsmmg down-regulated genes  are involved in metal or drug transport, cell lysis, or in regulating cellular stress responses, which alludes to the importance of the cell envelope in regulating the lsmmg response in minimal medium grown e. coli mg <dig>  more generally, all of the lsmmg up-regulated genes and a majority of the down-regulated genes of known function are present in or involved with regulation of the cellular envelope . this suggests that the cell envelope is superlative in sensing changes in its local environment and able to rapidly respond to the changes in a multifaceted way. future time course studies of the lsmmg response to minimal media in cells pre-adapted to the harv control environment may allow detailed study of how the genes involved are coordinated.

in rich medium, the majority of the e. coli mg <dig> genes that respond to the lsmmg environment are down-regulated, present in the cytoplasm, and involved in translation . in addition, several other ribosomal protein genes, including l <dig>  l <dig>  l7/l <dig> and l <dig> passed at least one statistical test and therefore may be down regulated as well. because ribosomes accumulate in a growth rate dependent matter, this apparent down regulation more likely is just a delay in the accumulation of translation related mrnas reflecting the slower growth of the lsmmg cultures relative to the control that was detected in the growth rate studies.

s. typhimurium is an evolutionarily close relative of e. coli and its response to lsmmg has been studied previously  <cit> . in fact, the majority of the e. coli mg <dig> lsmmg up- and down-regulated genes have homologues or orthologues in s. typhimurium . we therefore sought to compare our results to these earlier studies. it was immediately obvious that many more genes were reported to be responding to lsmmg in rich medium grown s. typhimurium than in e. coli mg <dig>  much of this difference was clearly the result of the statistical criteria used. to facilitate comparison, the e. coli mg <dig> transcriptional data was re-analyzed using the exact statistical methods employed previously for s. typhimurium  <cit> . this second analysis of the e. coli data identified essentially the same up- and down-regulated genes already described, as well as a number of additional genes . most of the additional e. coli mg <dig> genes were not considered further because of a very low level of gene expression in both lsmmg and control cultures, which greatly increased the possibility of false-positive results  <cit> .

lsmmg and control gene expression ratios for e. coli mg <dig>  and those of s. typhimurium  <cit>  were further compared to identify shared genes and operons that responded to lsmmg in a similar manner. surprisingly, e. coli genes that were up-regulated in lsmmg with the highest expression ratios were either not detectable in s. typhimurium  <cit>  or had a lsmmg fold change expression ratio <  <dig> . similarly, s. typhimurium genes with the greatest expression ratios in lsmmg, with the exception of sucd, were not significantly up-regulated in e. coli mg <dig> under lsmmg conditions . the gene sucd, which encodes a succinyl-coa synthase, was down-regulated in both organisms in rich medium   <cit> .

positive gene expression ratios indicate lsmmg up-regulation and negative ratios indicate down-regulation.

for both rich and minimal medium, a greater number of genes were down-regulated in response to lsmmg in e. coli mg <dig>  although only rich media was examined in detail in the case of s. typhimurium, the same pattern was observed  <cit> . in addition, many of the genes in e. coli mg <dig> that responded to lsmmg conditions were clustered in known or likely operons  and this pattern was also seen in s. typhimurium  <cit> . however, when individual genes were intercompared, it was abundantly clear that the vast majority of genes affected by lsmmg in e. coli mg <dig> and s. typhimurium were not affected in the same manner in the other organism. s. typhimurium may be responding to lsmmg in part by activating genes involved in pathogenicity and adhesion in an attempt to promote colonization in the low-shear environment. the consequences of this may be that s. typhimurium cells, although likely not genetically altered, are predisposed to the virulence state due to their attempt to adapt their gene expression to the lsmmg environment. this may explain why they are more infective in mice than cells not exposed to lsmmg  <cit> .

certainly, genetic variation between and within species  <cit>  and even variations between different laboratory stocks of a strain may contribute to differences in growth kinetics, final yield, and transcription  <cit> . in the present case, the commensal e. coli mg <dig> lacks many of the genes associated with pathogenesis in s. typhimurium with the cumulative result that adhesion in preparation for colonization is not e. coli mg1655's preferred response to lsmmg. thus, the dramatically different response to lsmmg that was observed between e. coli mg <dig> and s. typhimurium was perhaps not unexpected. the key conclusion here is that even closely related species can respond to lsmmg in different ways. this is a frustrating outcome for those seeking to ascertain what the effect of exposure to low-shear or the space environment will be for microorganisms in general.

CONCLUSIONS
since the evolution of bacteria has occurred in uniform gravity, it would seem unlikely that genes governing a direct response to variations in gravity would have evolved. with specific reference to the lsmmg environment then, it would be anticipated that direct or indirect effects of low-shear such as alterations in the extracellular fluid environment due to reduced mixing are likely to be more important in the bacterial transcriptional response than a direct effect of the randomized gravity vector. if there is in fact an increase in cell motility, then the resulting shear forces created by this motility should be considered too. if a specific response to changes in the gravity vector were occurring, these would likely be seen regardless of growth condition. based on the comparison of lsmmg regulated genes in rich and minimal medium, there does not appear to be such a generalized lsmmg response system or gene in e. coli mg <dig>  this conclusion is further supported by the absence of a strong correlation with the responses seen in s. typhimurium.

thus, the minimal media response to lsmmg seen here is more likely a response to conditions created by the loss of the gravity vector, e.g. low shear, than to gravity itself. a further test of this conclusion might be made by examining e. coli cultures growing in lsmmg environments under anaerobic conditions. if the change in a gene's expression is a direct response to gravity then it should respond in a similar manner regardless of aeration conditions.
