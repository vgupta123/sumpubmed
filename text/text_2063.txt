BACKGROUND
opioids are not only potent analgesics but are also drugs of abuse, which greatly limits their clinical use. chronic use of opioids results in the development of tolerance and dependence. recent studies suggest that non-opioid systems could be important targets for the treatment of opioid dependence  <cit> . antagonism of opioid effects by endogenous anti-opioid peptides is common  <cit> . cholecystokinin  was initially identified as a gastrointestinal hormone, and was subsequently found in the central and peripheral nervous systems. it occurs as various sized peptides, including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acid forms  <cit> . cholecystokinin octapeptide  is the most potent endogenous anti-opioid peptide  <cit> . for example, morphine treatments enhance the overflow of cck, whereas cck- <dig> and its analogues attenuate the analgesic effects of morphine  <cit> . furthermore, studies have demonstrated that the cck system modulates a variety of physiological processes, and that cck- <dig> interacts with the gabaergic and dopaminergic systems. thus, cck- <dig> plays a significant role in a wide range of central actions including memory and drug reward  <cit> . overlap in the distributions of cck and opioid receptors may be observed in some anatomical regions that are involved in opioid antinociception and dependence  <cit> . these findings indicate that the cck system is related to the modulation of morphine tolerance and dependence.

the administration of cck receptor antagonists can prevent or reverse tolerance to systemic exogenous opioids or electroacupuncture-induced analgesia, as well as suppress morphine withdrawal syndromes  <cit> . interestingly, cck receptor activation can reverse morphine tolerance  <cit> . we previously found that chronic pretreatment with exogenous cck- <dig> significantly inhibited naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms, which is the same effect as cck-receptor antagonists  <cit> . these phenomena suggest that the effects of exogenous cck- <dig> are distinct from the role of endogenous cck. with regard to dosage, cck- <dig> was able to prevent morphine dependence at high, but not low, concentrations  <cit> . however, no studies have reported a dose–response curve of cck- <dig> on morphine dependence. on the basis of the pharmacological properties and specificities for ligand binding, cck receptors have been identified for the cck <dig> and cck <dig> receptor subtypes  <cit> . the expression pattern of these cck receptors in mammals appears to be tissue-specific  <cit> . several studies have revealed that two different cck receptors  have opposing influences on behavioural and hormonal actions  <cit> . thus, cck receptor subtypes that mediate the inhibitory effects of exogenous cck- <dig> on morphine dependence remain to be determined.

the biological basis of tolerance and dependence induced by chronic exposure to opioids is thought to be due to molecular, cellular, and neural network adaptations. on the cellular level, opioid dependence is characterised by a significant elevation of adenylyl cyclase  activity after drug withdrawal, which is a regulatory phenomenon termed "ac supersensitivity" or "camp overshoot"  <cit> . a camp overshoot represents an opioid-dependent state in vitro and has been utilised in the study of the effects of morphine dependence  <cit> . this present study evaluates the effects of cck- <dig> on the amp overshoot based on a cellular model and aims to clarify the exact effects of exogenous cck- <dig>  in addition, the subtypes of cck receptor that mediate the function of cck- <dig> on morphine dependence are also investigated.

RESULTS
in vitro model of morphine dependence
the sh-sy5y cell line was used to examine the effects of cck- <dig> on cellular morphine dependence. it is well established that up-regulation of the adenylate cyclase effector system represents an in vitro opioid-dependent state. thus, withdrawal of opioids following chronic treatment leads to a camp overshoot, which is also referred to ‘camp super-sensitisation’, and is an in vitro model of the abstinence state. in the present study, the level of camp increased  <dig>  -folds after morphine treatment , and was elevated to  <dig>  -folds after naloxone treatment, compared to the non-treated cells . the analysis of the data obtained from the camp tests with two-way anova revealed a significant morphine and naloxone interaction  on the camp level, which indicated that the camp overshoot was significantly induced by chronic morphine exposure following naloxone precipitation .

the effect of chronic morphine exposure on the endogenous cck system
the expression of the opioid and cck system in sh-sy5y cells was initially confirmed. our results revealed that the μ-opioid, cck <dig> and cck <dig> receptors were co-expressed in sh-sy5y cells, and that sh-sy5y cells contained endogenous cck . the effect of chronic morphine exposure on the expression of the endogenous cck system in sh-sy5y cells was measured. the expression of the cck1/cck <dig> receptor and endogenous cck mrna were up-regulated  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold  after 10 μm morphine treatment for 48 h .

the effect of cck receptor antagonists on naloxone-precipitated camp overshoot in sh-sy5y cells after chronic morphine exposure
cck- <dig> is the most potent endogenous anti-opioid peptide and endogenous cck expression is up-regulated after chronic morphine treatment. therefore, l- <dig> , a cck <dig> receptor antagonist, and ly- <dig> , a cck <dig> receptor antagonist , were utilised to examine endogenous cck regulation of the development of morphine dependence in sh-sy5y cells. baseline experiments were first conducted in the absence of the opioid. pretreatment with l- <dig>   or ly- <dig>   alone did not affect cellular basal camp levels . co-pretreatment of ly- <dig>   with morphine  for 48 h significantly inhibited camp overshoot following naloxone  precipitation , however, l- <dig>  exhibited no effect . consistent with a previous study in vivo, these findings suggest that endogenous ccks have a notable effect on morphine dependence in vitro via the cck <dig> receptor.

the effect of exogenous cck- <dig> on naloxone-precipitated camp overshoot in sh-sy5y cells after chronic morphine exposure
exogenous cck- <dig> , a cck receptor agonist, inhibited the naloxone  precipitated camp overshoot when co-pretreated with morphine   in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that exogenous cck- <dig> has an identical regulatory effect on cellular morphine dependence as the antagonist. a significant inhibitory effect was observed at a concentration of  <dig>  μm  and 1 μm , but not at  <dig>  μm or  <dig>  μm , compared with the morphine pre-treated control cells. baseline experiments were conducted in the absence of the opioid. treatment with cck- <dig> at concentrations from  <dig>  to 1 μm for 48 h exhibited no effect on basal camp levels . moreover, exogenous cck- <dig> did not alter the forskolin stimulated camp levels , indicating that a non-specific inhibitory mechanism on camp shoot induced by cck- <dig> could be ruled out.

blockade of the cck <dig> receptor attenuates the effect of exogenous cck- <dig> on naloxone-precipitated camp overshoot after chronic morphine exposure
as described above, cck- <dig>  inhibited naloxone precipitated camp overshoot when co-pretreated with morphine in a dose-dependent manner. we then blocked cck <dig> and cck <dig> receptors using l- <dig>  and ly- <dig> , respectively, to determine the role of cck receptor subtypes in exogenous cck- <dig> regulating morphine dependence. the cells were pre-treated with l- <dig>   or ly- <dig>  , 15 min before co-treatment of morphine  and cck- <dig> . next, the camp overshoot was subsequently induced by adding 10 μm naloxone. the inhibitory effect of cck- <dig> on the naloxone precipitated camp overshoot was significantly reduced at both 1 μm  and 10 μm  l- <dig>  pre-treated cells . however, no change was observed in 1 μm  and 10 μm  ly- <dig>  pre-treated cells, indicating that the cck <dig> receptor mediated the effect of exogenous cck- <dig> on cellular morphine dependence. due to the inhibitory function of ly- <dig>  and cck- <dig> on the camp overshoot , a cumulative effect of ly- <dig>  and exogenous cck- <dig> was not observed.

discussion
in this present study, we describe a distinct effect of exogenous cck- <dig> on the development of morphine dependence in vitro. moreover, we provide the first piece of evidence that a cck <dig> receptor antagonist can reverse the inhibitory effects of exogenous cck- <dig> on morphine dependence. we also find that endogenous cck exerts a potential facilitative effect via the cck <dig> receptor. this suggests opposing roles of cck <dig> and cck <dig> receptors in the development of morphine dependence.

first, a suitable cell model was selected for this study. the sh-sy5y cell line is derived from a human neuroblastoma cell line, sk-n-sh, by three rounds of subcloning. the sh-sy5y cells are dopamine beta hydroxylase active, acetylcholinergic, glutamatergic and adenosinergic, and express abundant and functional μ- and δ-opioid receptors. sh-sy5y cells have been extensively used for studies of opioid receptor regulation and intracellular signaling. moreover, co-expression of the opioid and cck systems in sh-sy5y cells was confirmed, and cck is endogenously expressed in sh-sy5y cells. this system is useful for the study of the potential regulatory effects of exogenous cck- <dig> on morphine dependence.

the interaction between cck and opioids was first reported by itoh et al. they showed that pre-treatment with cck suppressed anti-nociception induced by β-endorphin  <cit> . a subsequent in vivo microdialysis study found that the extracellular levels of cck significantly increased after morphine administration, thus acting as a negative feedback modulator and a potent anti-opioid peptide  <cit> . studies have confirmed that endogenous cck potentiates, and the cck antagonist attenuates the tolerance and dependence of opioids  <cit> . the presence of opioid receptors in cck-containing neurons suggest a potential direct influence of opioids on cck release  <cit> . however, earlier studies have failed to show an affinity of cck for opioid receptors, indicating that cck does not behave as a classical receptor antagonist via binding to opioid receptors  <cit> . han et al. found that the binding of cck- <dig> to the cck receptor reduces the binding affinity of μ-opioid receptor ligands, implying that receptor–receptor interaction between cck and opioid systems may occur in an indirect manner  <cit> . the molecular cloning of cck receptor subtypes, one from the pancreas  and another from human brain , has confirmed the pharmacological classification of cck receptors. the cck <dig> receptor is predominantly localised in the cns, and mainly mediates anxiety, panic attacks, pain and drug dependence  <cit> . the cck <dig> receptor is present in discrete regions of the brain and has a low affinity for central cck  <cit> , and its function is poorly understood with only a few reports investigating the central role in food intake regulation  <cit> . the use of highly selective receptor antagonists and antisense approaches has shown, at least in the rodent, that cck <dig> receptors mediate the anti-opioid function of cck  <cit> . the present study shows that co-pretreatment with ly- <dig>  and morphine significantly inhibited the naloxone-precipitated camp overshoot in sh-sy5y cells, but that co-pretreatment with l- <dig>  displayed no effect. we verified that endogenous cck played an anti-opioid role and potentiated the development of morphine dependence via the cck <dig> receptor.

together with our previous results, we found that exogenous cck- <dig> pretreatment significantly inhibited morphine dependence in vitro and in vivo <cit> . these results show that the treatments of the cck receptor agonist and antagonist demonstrated the same effect on morphine dependence. moreover, cck- <dig> treatment did not affect basal or forskolin-stimulated camp levels, suggesting that the effect of exogenous cck- <dig> was not simply a direct action on camp. several studies have reported that small doses of cck inhibit the anti-nociceptive action of opioids, whereas large doses of cck induce analgesia  <cit> . we previously revealed that cck- <dig> suppressed the binding affinity of the μ-opioid receptor in sh-sy5y cells at concentrations of  <dig> nm, while it increased the expression of the endogenous opioid peptide from  <dig>  to 1 μm  <cit> . the dose–response curve of cck- <dig> was inversely u-shaped, and cck- <dig> displayed a dose-dependent, biphasic effect  <cit> . we found that only high concentrations of cck- <dig> were able to attenuate the camp overshoot in a dose-dependent manner. thus, observations of exogenous cck- <dig> may represent pharmacological effects, rather than physiological effects of endogenous cck.

a previous study indicated that the cck <dig> receptor was ineffective in the development of morphine dependence  <cit> . nevertheless, we found that a high dose of exogenous cck- <dig> markedly attenuated the naloxone precipitated camp overshoot via the cck <dig> receptor. we concluded that the cck <dig> and cck <dig> receptors play unique and distinct roles in physiology and pathophysiology. moreover, data showing that cck <dig> receptors mediate mnemonic effects, and that cck <dig> receptors mediate amnestic effects, have been reported  <cit> . furthermore, cck evokes [ca2+i signaling by the influx of extracellular calcium, likely through l-type calcium channels, and an antagonist for the cck <dig> receptor blocked [ca2+i response to cck- <dig>  <cit> . cck produces direct neuronal depolarisation via cck <dig> receptors and inhibits gabaergic synaptic transmission  <cit> , while cck <dig> receptor activation augments long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices  <cit> . cck- <dig>  the predominant central form of cck, has a high affinity for the cck <dig> receptor, but a low affinity for the cck <dig> receptor. the cck <dig> receptor is activated only in the presence of high cck- <dig> levels, and exerts a different effect from the cck <dig> receptor on morphine dependence. due to the inhibitory function of ly- <dig>  and cck- <dig> on camp overshoot, the cumulative effect of ly- <dig>  and exogenous cck- <dig> on camp overshoot was not observed. the role of cck <dig> receptor in the process of exogenous cck- <dig> regulation on morphine dependence can not be ruled out.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we identified a difference between the role of the cck <dig> and cck <dig> receptor on the development of morphine dependence and an inhibitory effect of high-doses of exogenous cck- <dig> on cellular morphine dependence. in addition, this study provides the first evidence for the participation of the cck <dig> receptor in the mechanism by which exogenous cck- <dig> inhibits morphine dependence.
