BACKGROUND
plants interact with a great diversity of microorganisms, including enteric bacteria. these interactions, which are governed by the characteristics of both host plant and bacteria, result in either commensalistic, mutualistic or parasitic relationships between both partners. in rice, bacterial endophytes may provide support to the host plant when these are under stress conditions  <cit> . for instance, rice growth under conditions of low temperature, high salinity or desiccation may be favored. moreover, endophytes can supply nitrogen to rice tissues  <cit> . in previous work, different bacteria, in particular belonging to the enterics, have been isolated from rice seeds  <cit> , roots  <cit>  and stems  <cit> . for example, enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens, previously described as erwinia dissolvens, was first isolated from diseased corn  <cit> , whereas it was also found in the endosphere of rice plants without causing apparent harm to the host plant  <cit> . enterobacter cancerogenus ncppb 2176t, e. nimipressuralis atcc 9912t and e. pyrinus atcc 49851t were isolated from symptomatic necrosis sites, respectively from poplar, elm and pear trees  <cit> . these organisms are therefore known as phytopathogens. on the other hand, organisms such as e. radicincitans d5/23t, e. arachidis ah-143t, e. oryzae ola-51t and enterobacter sp. cbmb <dig>  which have been isolated from respectively the phyllosphere of wheat, the rhizosphere of groundnut and the endosphere of rice species , can improve the fitness of their host plants and are therefore known as plant-growth-promoting bacteria .

in a recent study, we assessed the bacterial communities that occur within roots of rice plants by both cultivation-independent  and cultivation-dependent approaches  <cit> . from the directly-obtained clone library, ca. 30% of the sequences were assigned to one unique operational taxonomic unit , defined at 99% sequence similarity as a member of the genus enterobacter. in addition, we obtained a high number of bacterial isolates  from the same samples, by serial dilution on r2a agar. after screening these isolates to assess the number of different genotypes via box-a1r pcr,  <dig> distinct fingerprinting patterns were observed across all, using an 80% similarity cut-off level  <cit> . preliminary analysis of the 16s rrna genes of each of these groups revealed a suite of six independent  strains that were closely related to the most abundantly retrieved otu from the clone library. this clearly demonstrated the predominance of enterobacter-related types in the rice root bacterial community and indicated their potential functional importance. the 16s rrna sequences also matched a sequence obtained from an enterobacter sp. , a rice endophytic bacterium isolated in south korea that was reported to have plant-growth-promoting properties  <cit> .

in the current study, the six strains, divided into two related groups of three strains each, are further characterized. on the basis of the collective results obtained, we propose that they constitute two new species, which we denominate enterobacter oryziphilus sp. nov.  and enterobacter oryzendophyticus sp. nov. .

RESULTS
presumptive identification of strains
six isolates, obtained from different rice root samples, were grouped, by preliminary analyses, into two groups of three strains each, which both resembled, by comparison of their partial 16s rrna gene sequences, the dominant clones in a directly obtained clone library  <cit> . analyses of the full 16s rrna gene sequences of all isolates then revealed hits, at high levels of homology, with sequences belonging to members of the genus enterobacter, including the type strains of several different species. figure  <dig> gives a depiction of a maximum parsimony  based phylogenetic tree, which used  <dig> unambiguously aligned positions,  <dig> of which are informative under the parsimony criterion. the tree was constructed on the basis of a comparison of the six new isolates with a range of related  sequences. the topology of the tree was strongly supported by bootstrap analyses . phylogenetic inference on the basis of maximum likelihood was also performed and yielded the same result as that obtained with the mp based trees . thus, on the basis of the 16s rrna gene sequences, strains reica_ <dig>  reica_ <dig> and reica_ <dig> were identical and formed a separate branch in the tree that indicated a novel phylogenetic group . moreover, the sequences of the remaining three novel strains, i.e. reica_ <dig>  reica_ <dig> and reica_ <dig>  were virtually identical to each other  and formed another separate branch  in the tree. again, this branch was strongly supported by bootstrap analyses . this 16s rrna gene based analysis provided preliminary evidence for the contention that both groups of strains, i and ii, may form the core of two novel rice-interactive enterobacter species.

one strain of group-i, i.e. reica_ <dig>  was then selected as the putative type strain of a novel taxon, denoted reica_142t. it revealed closest relatedness, at the level of the 16s rrna gene sequence, to e. arachidis ah-143t , e. oryzae ola-51t , e. radicincitans d5/23t  and e. cloacae subsp. cloacae atcc 13047t . moreover, strain reica_ <dig> of group-ii was taken as the putative type strain of another novel taxon . this taxon was most closely related  to e. cloacae subsp. cloacae atcc 13047t , e. cloacae subsp. dissolvens atcc 23373t , e. arachidis ah-143t  and e. oryzae ola-51t .

however, classification on the basis of a single phylogenetic marker, in particular the 16s rrna gene, has known caveats for species within the genus enterobacter. the genus itself is poorly definable. to overcome such taxonomic difficulties, it has been proposed that a second phylogenetic marker, i.e. rpob, should be used for the identification of species within the enterobacteriaceae, including enterobacter <cit> . the rpob gene encodes the β-subunit of rna polymerase and is part of the core genome of enterobacter. this gene has higher discriminatory power than the 16s rrna gene and has been recommended for use in a more robust allocation of new species  <cit> . moreover, similarities in sequences of the rpob gene have been found to be highly correlated with those of the g+c% of bacterial genomes, as well as with dna:dna hybridization values  <cit> . thus, rpob has become an important proxy in studies aiming for the discrimination of closely-related strains and species. a comparison of the rpob gene sequences of all six strains and their closest neighbours  revealed that all novel sequences were less than 98% similar to any of the described sequences. given the fact that the 98% level of rpob gene sequence similarity represents the proposed cut-off level for the definition of species within the family enterobacteriaceae <cit> , this yielded a second piece of evidence for the contention that the two groups of new strains constitute novel species within the enterobacteriaceae. figure  <dig> further showed that the rpob sequences of strains of group-i  were identical to each other, grouping distantly with a cluster containing sequences of e. radicincitans d5/23t , e. arachidis ah-143t  and e. cowanii cip 107300t . the rpob gene sequences of the group-ii strains were also virtually identical, with those of strains reica_ <dig> and reica_ <dig> being the same and  <dig> % similar to that of reica_082t. as these sequences were quite divergent from those of any other group , a separate cluster was defined in the tree . the sequence of the proposed group-ii type strain reica_082t was most closely related to that of e. radicincitans d5/23t , e. arachidis ah-143t  and strain reica_142t . phylogenetic inference on the basis of maximum likelihood corroborates the results obtained with the mp based trees . additionally, the rpob gene based analyses were supported by those of the predicted proteins; in these nucleotide sequence based analyses, the strains of groups i and ii again clustered tightly together within a main cluster encompassing a range of enterobacter  strains including the same close relatives as above .

in the light of the results obtained with the two-pronged approach based on the 16s rrna and rpob gene sequence analyses, we posit that the six novel rice endophytic strains represent two different species within the genus enterobacter. however, this genus is currently undergoing a re-examination. for instance, a novel genus termed cronobacter, has been recently coined, as a split-off of particular species/strains belonging to the group. we found that the rpob sequences of the two type strains of our novel proposed species groups, reica_142t and reica_082t, were quite distantly related to those of the type species e. cloacae subsp. cloacae atcc 13047t  and cronobacter sakazaki lmg 5740t . these values are actually well below the reasonable limit of 6% sequence dissimilarity, which has been proposed to differentiate genera within the enterobacteriaceae <cit> . in the future, these might be focal points for the definition of novel genera. it is interesting that both the 16s rrna gene and the rpob gene sequence based phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of robust clades , in which our novel group-i strains  were most related to the enterobacter type strains e. radicincitans d5/23t and e. arachidis ah-143t. it is important to remark that the latter strains have previously been shown to improve plant growth by increasing the root length, as well as the  mass, of several host plants  <cit> . therefore, an understanding of the ecology of our novel strains will add to a growing body of knowledge on the species diversity of enterobacter types in rice roots. ecological behaviour is locked in into taxonomy in particular with respect to those traits that define phenotype. given the fact that a sound species definition depends on a combination of techniques, including an analysis of genomic dna relatedness, we determined the dna:dna homologies among a selection of our novel and closely-related strains.

genomic dna:dna hybridization analyses confirm the existence of two novel enterobacter species
pairwise genomic dna hybridization tests  were performed across a selection of four strains of the two newly defined species  and the closest relatives e. arachidis lmg 26131t, e radicincitans lmg 23767t, e. cowanii lmg 23569t and e. oryzae lmg 24251t . first, these analyses revealed that the group-i strains reica_142t and reica_ <dig> and the group-ii ones reica_082t and reica_ <dig> had high within-group dna:dna relatedness , whereas the putative type strains reica_142t  and reica_082t  had low  dna:dna relatedness between them. these results suggested a taxonomic tightness within the two groups, versus a low relatedness between them. taking the 70% similarity criterion as the basis for the separation or junction of species, the data provided sound evidence for the contention that the two groups constitute disparate species.

the data are based on means of at least  <dig> hybridizations. the values given between brackets are the differences between the reciprocal values. taxa:  <dig>  enterobacter oryzendophyticus reica_032;  <dig>  enterobacter oryzendophyticus reica_082t;  <dig>  enterobacter oryziphilus reica_142t;  <dig>  enterobacter oryziphilus reica_191;  <dig>  enterobacter cowanii lmg 23569t;  <dig>  enterobacter radicincitans lmg 23767t;  <dig>  enterobacter oryzae lmg 24251t;  <dig>  enterobacter arachidis lmg 26131t.

furthermore, group-i type strain reica_142t dna showed only about 35-60% relatedness with the dna of the closest relatives e. arachidis lmg 26131t , e radicincitans lmg 23767t  and e. cowanii lmg 23569t . this finding is consistent with the contention that the group-i strains indeed form a separate species, within the genus enterobacter. similarly, strain reica_082t genomic dna revealed relatedness values that were significantly below the 70% cut-off value with that of the closest-related strains e. oryzae lmg 24251t , e. radicincitans lmg 23767t , e. cowanii lmg 23569t  and e. arachidis lmg 26131t  . again, this finding supports our contention that also the group-ii strains form a separate species within the genus enterobacter.

it was interesting to note that the dna-dna relatedness values between e. radicincitans lmg 23767t and e. oryzae lmg 24251t  and between e. radicincitans lmg 23767t and e. arachidis lmg 26131t , in our experiments, were much higher than those reported by the original authors  <cit> . support for the robustness of our data is provided by the phylogenetic relationships revealed by the rpob gene sequences, where e. radicincitans d5/23t and e. arachidis ah-143t were  <dig> % similar. these data were further consistent with the cellular fatty acid profile data , which were indistinguishable at strain level.

the overall genomic dna g+c content was determined according to the hplc method  <cit>  using the dna prepared for the dna:dna hybridization analyses. the values  for the selected group-ii strains reica_ <dig> and reica_082t and group-i strains reica_142t and reica_ <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  and  <dig>  mol%, respectively. these values are within the lower range of the dna mol% g + c, i.e. 52– <dig> %, of all members of the genus enterobacter <cit> .

fatty acid methyl ester  profiling confirms the allocation of group-i and group-ii strains into two novel enterobacteriaceae species
the fame profiles obtained by using the midi system from all six novel strains were similar to those of several type strains of the aforementioned enterobacter species. however, there were differences in the relative proportions of particular fatty acids. first, based on the data, the six strains could again be separated into the exact same two groups, denoted i  and ii . expectedly, the putative type strains of the two groups shared some commonalities, as the predominant cellular fatty acids of group-i strain reica_142t and group-ii strain reica_082t were c16: <dig> , summed feature  <dig> , summed feature  <dig>  and c17: <dig> cyclo . moreover, fatty acids c14: <dig> and c12: <dig> were also found . although it is known that the  library of the midi  system is incomplete and provides somewhat biased results, a comparison with this database resulted in the remote affiliation of group-i strain reica_142t with salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and/or serratia marcescens  and that of group-ii strain reica_082t with klebsiella mobilis, escherichia coli, escherichia fergusonii and k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae . however, environmental enteric strains are underrepresented in this database and an update is needed to allow any robust taxonomic assignment of environmental strains.

a dendrogram constructed on the basis of the above data indicated that the selected group-i and group-ii representatives cluster within the enterobacteriaceae, but not within any known species . thus, group-i strain reica_142t was related to enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae subgroup c, whereas it also resembled serratia marcescens subgroup c and klebsiella oxytoca subgroup b. moreover, group-ii strain reica_082t was related to e. coli subgroups c and e, e. fergusonii subgroup a, k. mobilis and salmonella enterica subsp. houtenae . the cellular fatty acid profile of e. arachidis ah-143t was highly similar to that of e. radicincitans d5/23t, with a euclidian distance below  <dig>  . both strains formed a distinct cluster related to leclercia adecarboxylata subgroup a, citrobacter freundii, k. oxytoca subgroup d and s. marcescens subgroup d.

novel species descriptions
cells of all novel strains, i.e. reica_142t, reica_ <dig>  reica_ <dig>  and reica_082t, reica_ <dig> and reica_ <dig> , were facultatively anaerobic, gram-negative, motile and straight rod-shaped . after  <dig> h incubation at 37°c on tsa, the colonies were flat, translucent, regularly-shaped and beige-pigmented. after an extended period of incubation, colonies of group-ii strain reica_082t showed filiform margins, whereas those of the other strains did not show this phenomenon. all strains grew at temperatures between  <dig> and 42°c and in the presence of up to 5% nacl. the putative type strains reica_142t  and reica_082t  were resistant to ampicillin , colistin sulphate , kanamycin , nitrofurantoin  and streptomycin . however, they were sensitive to rifampicin and gentamicin , chloramphenicol  and tetracycline . strain reica_082t was resistant to nalidixic acid . on the other hand, strain reica_142t was not.

all group-i and group-ii strains were catalase-positive and oxidase-negative and revealed physiological and biochemical characteristics similar to those of other strains of the genus enterobacter <cit> . they could be differentiated from species in closely-related genera, i.e. klebsiella, escherichia and salmonella, as follows. the novel  enterobacter species were positive for arginine dihydrolase, showed motility and were negative for the utilization of quinic acid. in contrast, klebsiella species are non-motile , are arginine-negative and are capable to utilize quinic acid. the novel  species produced acetoin  but not indole. in contrast, escherichia species are acetoin-negative but produce indole. interestingly, indole production has also been observed in cronobacter species, and hence the two new species were differentiated from cronobacter. the group-i and group-ii strains were all negative for the production of hydrogen sulphide, where, in contrast, species of salmonella are positive.

notwithstanding the limitations of the api 20e biochemical test database, it was applied for all strains of group i and ii, next to the closely-related comparator strains . on the basis of the api 20e system, the six strains fell precisely into the two groups , as delineated in the foregoing. these were differentiated by the following characteristics: group-i strains reica_142t, reica_ <dig> and reica_ <dig> were positive for d-alanine, l-alanylglycine, l-aspartic acid and l-glutamic acid. at least one of these strains was also positive for the utilization of cis-aconitic acid and l-histidine. on the other hand, the group-ii strains reica_082t, reica_ <dig> and reica_ <dig> could utilize the following substrates as sole carbon sources: d-raffinose, malonic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, tween  <dig>  l-proline, inosine and thymidine. at least one of these strains was positive for the utilization of d-melibiose, α-cyclodextrin, acetic acid, formic acid and glycogen. the discriminatory properties of the two novel species and closely related species are given in table  <dig> 

afor all strains analysed, the following tests were positive: catalase, β-galactosidase  and motility and negative for: oxidase, lysine decarboxylase, urease, indole and h2s production.

the putative type strains reica_142t and reica_082t were then compared to the api20e database. the database revealed as closest relative for the group-i type strain reica_142tenterobacter asburiae  and for group-ii type strain reica_082te. cloacae , respectively. the two strains differed mainly in the ornithine decarboxylase test and in the production of acid from l-rhamnose and d-melibiose . however, this database is as limited as the midi one discussed earlier, and environmental strains are needed to make it suitable for environmental work.

plant-beneficial and adaptive traits
finally, we evaluated the capacities of strains reica_142t  and reica_082t  to modulate rice plant growth and to colonize rice host plants from soil. group-ii strain reica_082t produced indole acetic acid  from l-tryptophan, whereas group-i strain reica_142t did not. both strains revealed the production of acetoin, 2-ketogluconate via gluconate dehydrogenase and siderophores , and the solubilisation of phosphate via acidification but not alkalinisation. 2-ketogluconate is the salt compound of the organic acid 2-ketogluconic acid. this organic acid is produced by phosphate-solubilizing bacteria  and is known to be involved in the solubilisation of inorganic phosphates  <cit> . cellulase activity, as well as growth on “copiotrophic” and “oligotrophic” media, were observed for both strains, but no amylase and protease activities were registered. strain reica_082t showed growth on m <dig> salt agar amended with methanol, but strain reica_142t did not. supporting evidence for the transformation of methanol was provided by the finding that the gene encoding the alpha subunit of methanol dehydrogenase could be amplified from the reica_082t genome . to the best of our knowledge, only two other enterobacter strains  have previously been shown to be able to use methanol as the sole carbon and energy source  <cit> . in semi-solid rennie medium , strains reica_142t and reica_082t reduced, respectively,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of acetylene to ethylene during  <dig> h of incubation at 37°c, indicating their nitrogen fixing capacity. as a control, bacterial cells that had been inactivated after boiling the liquid culture for  <dig> min did not show acetylene reduction. moreover, the presence of the gene encoding nitrogen reductase could be shown in both organisms using pcr . these results show that both bacteria are diazotrophic and may be capable of establishing endophytic associations with rice and growth in plant tissue, most likely without causing any harm to the host.

therefore, the rifampicin-resistant derivative of strain reica_ <dig>  denoted reica_142tr, was tested for colonization and growth in planta in a colonization experiment with young rice seedlings to which the strain was introduced. all replicate rice seedlings growing in gamma-sterlized as well as natural soil showed invasion by strain reica_142tr. plants growing in strain reica_142tr treated pre-sterilized soil revealed populations of  <dig> ± <dig>  log cfu g- <dig> fresh root tissue and  <dig> ± <dig>  log cfu g- <dig> fresh shoot tissue, whereas plants from non-presterilized soil treated with the same strain revealed lower numbers of cells, i.e.  <dig> ± <dig>  log cfu g-1fresh root tissue and  <dig> ± <dig>  log cfu g- <dig> fresh shoot tissue. no bacterial growth was observed on plates that received homogenates from rice plants growing in uninoculated soils , leading to the conclusion that their numbers were below  <dig>  log cfu g- <dig> fresh weight. under the experimental conditions used, no significant differences in plant fresh weight  were noticed between inoculated and control plants. in sterile soil, the fresh weight of rice seedlings growing in the presence of strain reica_142tr was  <dig>  g , while plants growing without this strain weighed  <dig>  g . however, the introduction of strain reica_142tr apparently did alter plant physiology, albeit below statistical significance . thus increases of 40% and decreases of around 9% in the root and shoot fresh weights, respectively, were noted. it is interesting to note that the beneficial effect of plant-growth-promoting bacteria is often associated with the inoculant population density. for instance, a significant increase in the growth of young brassica oleracea plants was only observed at high inoculum level of e. radicincitans d5/23t , but not at a lower level, i.e.  <dig> log cfu per plant  <cit> . rice plants growing in non-sterile soil revealed reduced fresh weights, i.e.  <dig>  g  for uninoculated plants and  <dig>  g  for inoculated ones. the initial microbiota in the unsterilized soil thus appeared to impair the growth of rice plants, when compared to sterilized soil. in a recent review, reinhold-hurek and hurek  <cit>  addressed the recalcitrance of bacterial endophytes to cultivation. many abundant endophytes that are active in planta are still uncultivable. in addition, the already cultivated ones are often scarcely culturable in planta. we here provide evidence for the existence of two novel culturable enterobacter species in the rice endosphere. the group-i strain reica_142tr was remarkable, as it is easily cultivated in vitro as well as in planta. besides, this strain was related to a dominant gene sequence found in the library representing rice root endophytes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
arguments for the definition of two novel enterobacter species
on the basis of the foregoing data and arguments for the importance and relevance of rice-associated enterobacter species, we propose that the group-i and group-ii strains are classed into two novel species that should - considering the genus is intact at this point in time - be placed inside the genus enterobacter. first, both groups are internally very homogeneous, and, by all criteria used, they class as solid taxonomic units. secondly, on the basis of  the 16s rrna gene sequence similarity,  the rpob gene sequence similarity and  the dna:dna hybridization data, we clearly discern the appearance of two novel groups  within the genus enterobacter. these two strain groups are thus proposed to form two novel species, denoted enterobacter oryziphilus and enterobacter oryzendophyticus. both groups are likely to have their preferred niche in association with rice plants. they may play key roles in the rice endosphere, providing an ecologically-based justification for their definition. the descriptions of the two species are given below.
