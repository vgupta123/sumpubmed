BACKGROUND
glutamine synthetase  catalyzes the atp-dependent addition of ammonium  to the Î³-carboxyl group of glutamate to produce glutamine and acts as the center for nitrogen flow in plants. glutamate synthase  then catalyzes the conversion of glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate to produce two molecules of glutamate, one of which participates in further ammonium assimilation via gs while the other donates reduced nitrogen for all nitrogen-containing biomolecules  <cit> . the ammonium assimilated by gs in the production of glutamine can come from various sources, including direct uptake from the soil, reduction of nitrate and nitrite, photorespiration, deamination of phenylalanine catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and the catabolic release of ammonium during the mobilization of vegetative storage proteins and during senescence.

multiple nuclear encoded gs polypeptides are expressed in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues of higher plants and these polypeptides are assembled into oligomeric isoenzymes located either in the cytosol or in the chloroplast  <cit> . recently it has been reported that plant gs holoenzyme has a decameric structure composed of two face-to face pentameric rings of subunits, with active sites formed between every two neighboring subunits within each ring  <cit> . phylogenetic studies of nucleotide and amino acid sequences have shown that genes for chloroplastic and cytosolic gs in plants form two sister groups with a common ancestor which diverged by duplication before the split between angiosperms and gymnosperms  <cit> .

in angiosperms there are two main isoforms of gs, cytosolic gs  and a chloroplastic gs . this suggests that there are several distinct pathways for glutamine production, both spatially and temporally. in developing leaves, glutamine is mainly produced in chloroplasts through the activity of the gs <dig> isoenzyme. the ammonium assimilated into glutamine in young leaves is produced by nitrate reduction and through photorespiration  <cit> . alternatively, cytosolic gs <dig> primarily generates glutamine for intercellular nitrogen transport. the cytosolic enzyme assimilates ammonium taken up from the soil and released in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids and nitrogen remobilization  <cit> . thus, gs <dig> genes are differentially expressed in roots and in vascular tissues. molecular analysis of genomic gs sequences from a number of angiosperm species has shown that the cytosolic gs <dig> genes belong to a small multigene family, whereas, the chloroplastic gs <dig> is encoded by a single gene  <cit> .

gs plays a fundamental role in growth and development of woody plants  <cit> . in poplar, this critical role for gs has been clearly demonstrated through studies of transgenic poplars that express ectopically the pine cytosolic gs. transgenic poplars exhibit enhanced vegetative growth  <cit> , enhanced resistance to drought stress at both ecophysiological and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels  <cit> , and enhanced nitrogen use efficiency  <cit> . these results clearly lead to the conclusion that in poplar gs activity is a limiting factor in growth and development. the current work was undertaken to develop a more comprehensive understanding of molecular and biochemical features of gs gene family in poplar, to establish an understanding of the roles of specific members of the poplar gs gene family during development, and to characterize the developmental regulation of gs expression in various tissues and at various times during the poplar perennial growth.

RESULTS
identification and structural analysis of poplar gs genes
a search of the populus trichocarpa whole genomic sequence at the jgi  <cit>  allowed us to identify regions containing gs sequences. eight sequences containing a complete orf as well as the structural and regulatory elements for a functional gene were retained for further study. the poplar genome data base also contains  <dig> gs pseudogenes as well as an additional gs gene showing a high identity level to the gs genes in archaebacteria. the full-length cdnas  of the  <dig> gs genes were analyzed and the characteristics of the polypeptides encoded by their orfs were compared . the results of all these bioinformatic analyses allowed the identification of  <dig> genes coding for a cytosolic gs iosenzyme  and  <dig> genes coding for a plastidic gs isoenzyme . additionally, our analysis suggests that the gs gene family in poplar is organized in  <dig> groups of duplicated genes, ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig>  according to the original identification numbers at the jgi database, poplar gs <dig> genes were named ptgs <dig> - <dig> and ptgs <dig> - <dig>  ptgs <dig> - <dig> and ptgs <dig> - <dig>  ptgs <dig> - <dig> and ptgs <dig> - <dig>  following the same criteria, poplar gs <dig> genes were named ptgs2- <dig> and ptgs2- <dig>  the genetic distance between the different gs genes was calculated considering the complete genomic sequence of the individual members of the gene family confirming the existence of the gs gene duplicates.

the four duplicated gs genes were positioned in the linkage groups  or scaffolds present in the populus trichocarpa genome . the genomic regions where the gs genes were located were examined in detail by determination of the open reading frames  upstream and downstream of the specific gs genes and cross-alignment of these adjacent regions between the gene pairs. several duplicated genes were collinearly positioned for the ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig> duplicates. however, it was not possible to localize the ptgs <dig>  duplicate because the region dowstream ptgs <dig> - <dig> was not present in the scaffold where the gene is located . non-duplicated genes were also observed near the gs genes, as well as internal duplications located on the same chromosome.

structural analysis of the gs gene family in poplar was performed by comparison of the exon/intron organization. as shown in figure  <dig> the size of the exons is generally well conserved in the four duplicates, ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig>  however, the genomic structure is substantially different at the intron regions with introns significantly divergent in size and sequence. in contrast to these observed differences among the gene duplications, the exon/intron boundaries are almost identical between the two members of each duplicate . the ptgs <dig> and ptgs <dig>  duplicates contain  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, the ptgs <dig>  duplicate presents  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, and the ptgs. <dig>  duplicate contains  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns. interestingly, exon  <dig> in the ptgs <dig>  duplicate represents the fusion of exons  <dig> and  <dig> in the ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig> duplicates. on the other hand, the last exon in the ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig>  duplicates represents the fusion of exons  <dig> and  <dig> in the ptgs <dig>  duplicate. it is interesting to note the presence of an intron of more than  <dig> kb interrupting exons  <dig> and  <dig> in the ptgs <dig>  duplicate.

comparative analysis of gs gene families in sequenced plant genomes
to examine the evolutionary relationships of poplar gs genes we performed a cladistic analysis based on deduced amino acid sequences, including the complete gs gene families from the sequenced genomes of arabidopsis, rice, grape, sorghum and poplar. pine and spruce gs genes were also included in this comparative analysis . phylogenetic reconstruction at the molecular level shows the separation of cytosolic  and chloroplastic  sequences in angiosperms as two well differentiated clusters. figure  <dig> also shows that poplar duplicates for gs <dig> and gs <dig> genes were distributed in the two clusters. gs <dig> genes from arabidopsis, rice, grape and sorghum were distributed in three subfamilies and the ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig>  duplicates were clearly associated to two of these subfamilies. in contrast, the ptgs <dig>  duplicate was outside the conserved gs <dig> subfamilies and was more closely aligned with the gs <dig> isoforms of gymnosperms that group outside the main subfamilies of gs <dig> in angiosperms. however, these data should be interpreted with caution because the support values of the clades are moderate.

regulatory regions in the poplar gs genes
in order to get insight into the function of gs genes in poplar, the presence of regulatory elements in the 5'-upstream regions was investigated. according to results previously obtained in the structural and phylogenetic analyses, we decided to consider exclusively regulatory elements that were present in the two members of a gs duplicate . in the ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig>  genes, these common regulatory elements were found concentrated in the proximal region of the promoter . in contrast, the presence of common regulatory elements spanned a major region in the promoter of the ptgs <dig> duplicate . putative regulatory elements involved in the interaction with myb trancription factors were identified exclusively in the ptgs <dig>  duplicate. light-responsive elements such as gata boxes were identified in all gene duplicates except ptgs <dig> . regulatory elements involved in tissue-specific gene expression  were identified in all genes except ptgs <dig> , whereas aba response elements were present in the promoters of ptgs <dig>  duplicates. boxes specific to cytokinin response were identified in all gs genes but auxin response elements were exclusively found in ptgs <dig> . the poplar gs <dig> promoter contains a sequence of about  <dig> bp showing a 90% identity with light-regulatory elements that have been functionally characterized in the gs <dig> of pea and common bean  <cit> . finally, the presence of at-rich regions was detected in all gs promoters although they were much less abundant in the ptgs <dig> duplicate.

organ-specific expression of duplicate gs genes in poplar
to understand the regulation of the gs gene family in poplar and obtain further insight into the biological roles of members in the gene family, gs expression was precisely quantified spatial and temporally. total rna was extracted from different organs and the relative abundance of gs transcripts was determined quantitatively by real-time pcr . in all cases the transcript levels were normalized by comparison with expression levels of reference genes . two month-old hybrid poplars were divided into above-ground and root-regions . the aerial region included the meristematic apex , young leaves and stem internodes , intermediate leaves and stem internodes , mature leaves and stem internodes . aerial regions a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> were further subdivided in lamina of the leaf , leaf vein  and stem . the root region included the main root close to the root crown  and the secondary root masses . as shown in figure  <dig>  gene expression profiles of ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig> differed significantly in the samples examined. ptgs <dig>  transcripts were particularly abundant in the aerial regions containing intermediate and mature leaves  and in r <dig>  interestingly, maximum levels of ptgs <dig>  expression were observed in the leaf lamina  with decreased abundance in the leaf veins . minor levels of gene expression were observed in petioles  and stems . for the ptgs <dig>  duplicate the highest transcript abundance was observed in the secondary root masses , while about a half of this value was observed in petioles  and stems  of the aerial parts . much lower levels of ptgs <dig>  transcripts were detected in remaining samples. figure  <dig> also shows that expression of the ptgs <dig>  duplicate was predominant among the poplar gs <dig> genes, and high levels of ptgs <dig>  transcripts were observed in the apex, aerial and root sections. furthermore, levels of ptgs <dig>  transcripts were highest of the poplar gs gene family in the apex. it is important to note that in the aerial sections, expression of ptgs <dig>  was clearly associated with samples enriched in vascular tissue, such as petioles  and stems  whereas lower levels of gene expression were observed in the leaf lamina in all sections examined. finally, analysis of the ptgs <dig> duplicate revealed that the transcripts of this family member were the most abundant in the young leaves , and decreased progressively from the top to the bottom of the tree, with the lowest values detected in the roots.

in order to determine if there was a correspondence between the expression patterns of the gs transcripts and the distribution of gs polypeptides, we examined the distribution of gs polypeptides in different organs. total proteins were extracted from leaves, stems and roots of two month-old poplar trees and gs polypeptides in these organs were identified by western blot analysis using antibodies raised against pine gs  <cit> . it has been previously reported that these antibodies were able to recognize specifically poplar gs polypeptides  <cit> . figure 6a shows the identification of two gs polypeptides, gs <dig>  and gs <dig>  in the leaf lamina. the gs <dig> polypeptide was predominant in stems and roots.

in order to investigate the correspondence of gs trancripts and gs polypeptides in the different organs, total proteins from the same protein samples  were also separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , and the gs polypeptides identified by western blotting . this experimental approach allowed us to identify gs polypeptides of different charge among the family of gs polypeptides of the same size. thus, in the leaf lamina the gs <dig> polypeptide was resolved as several spots with the most abundant exhibiting a calculated isoelectric point  of  <dig> . the gs <dig> polypeptide was resolved as a major spot of a pi of  <dig> . in the stem, two major major spots corresponded to gs <dig> polypeptides of pi  <dig>  and  <dig> . finally, in the roots the major gs <dig> spot had a calculated pi of  <dig> . these experimental pi values were in the range of the predicted pi values for poplar gs polypeptides .

seasonal changes in gs gene expression
we were also interested to know the seasonal changes in the expression of the gs gene family in poplar. transcript levels of ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig> were quantitatively determined in rna extracts from leaves, stem, buds and bark of 10-year-old poplar trees . figure  <dig> shows that gs duplicates exhibited contrasting patterns of gene expression during annual growth. the expression of the ptgs <dig>  duplicate was very low during winter and increased during spring to reach the maximum values at the end of summer and autumn. interestingly, the peak values of transcripts were observed in leaves. transcript abundance for the ptgs <dig>  duplicate was low in all samples examined at the different seasons of the year. ptgs <dig>  was highly expressed in stems buds and bark during all seasons with peak transcript levels during spring and autumn. interestingly, the levels of ptgs <dig>  transcripts were low in leaves except in autumn when levels increased significantly. finally, high levels of ptgs <dig> transcripts were exclusively detected in expanding leaves in spring.

discussion
the gs gene family in poplar consists of  <dig> different genes which exhibit all structural and regulatory elements to be potentially considered as functional genes . a detailed analysis of the genomic gs sequences suggests that the gs gene family in poplar is organized into  <dig> groups of duplicated genes, ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig> , ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig>  these gs genes are distributed on separate loci in different chromosomes, and to our knowledge, populus trichocarpa is the first plant species in which the complete gs family is observed to be duplicated. however, the duplication of a single gs gene has been previously reported in plants. thus, two copies of gs <dig> genes have been described in pisum sativum  <cit> , and more recently the occurrence of two distinct gs <dig> genes have been reported in medicago truncatula  <cit> . homology-microsynteny analysis of the genomic regions where the gs genes are located strongly suggests that the origin of the duplicated genes is a genome-wide duplication event that occurred approximately  <dig> myr and which is still detectable over approximately 92% of the poplar genome  <cit> . following duplication, new copies of a gene may undergo modifications allowing functional diversification, which is a significant source of evolutionary novelty in plants  <cit> . however, it is also possible that a duplicated gene copy is rapidly lost through pseudogenisation. interestingly, the exon-intron organization is highly conserved in each pair of duplicated genes in poplar and similar regulatory elements are present in their promoters. these findings provide evidence supporting the expression of gs duplicates in the same cell-types where they are subjected to similar developmental and environmental cues. furthermore, their coding regions are also quite well-conserved, indicating they encode for essentially the same or very similar gs enzymes. all these results suggest that these duplicated genes could play equivalent roles in poplar nitrogen metabolism.

the molecular and functional analyses of gs gene families in other plants revealed specialization of gs isoenzymes to fulfil specific and non-overlapping roles in nitrogen metabolism depending of the tissue and plant species  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses of poplar gs genes have shown that genes encoding chloroplastic and cytosolic isoforms form two sister groups as previously described for other gs gene families  <cit> . it has been suggested that the two groups of genes  diverged by duplication from a common ancestor  <cit>  and that this separation occurred before the divergence of gymnosperms/angiosperms  <cit>  but possibly after the appearance of vascular plants  <cit> . it has been proposed that the gain of a n-terminal transit peptide in gs <dig> would provide adaptive advantages to plants through enhanced photorespiratory ammonium assimilation in the plastids  <cit> . members of the gs <dig> clade in angiosperms are grouped in subfamilies as previously reported by others  <cit> . ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig>  duplicates were found associated to these subfamilies suggesting they could play similar functions to those described for these isoforms. in contrast, the ptgs <dig>  duplicate was found separated from ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig>  genes.

the intron-exon organization of the poplar gs genes supports the above hypothesis . the positions and lengths of exons are quite similar for all genes suggesting that the structure of the ancestral gs gene has been maintained during evolution with some modifications, such as the presence of a plastid targeting sequence in the first exon of gs <dig> and minor changes in some other exons of gs <dig> genes.

a detailed analysis of gs transcript abundance in different tissues and organs of poplar allowed us to identify specific expression patterns of the individual members of the gene family . ptgs <dig> transcripts were most abundant in leaves as previously reported for other angiosperms where the gs <dig> isoform is responsible for assimilation of photorespiratory ammonium  <cit> . in fact, the promoters of the poplar gs <dig> duplicates contained cis regulatory elements described in other gs <dig> genes in angiosperms  <cit> . an additional role of gs <dig> is the assimilation of nitrate-derived ammonium in leaves. it is well known that plants differ in the localization of nitrate reduction and assimilation. thus, some species localize nitrate reduction and assimilation in the roots, whereas other species assimilate nitrate preferentially in the leaves. in poplar, most nitrate assimilation takes place in the leaves  <cit> . therefore, high levels of the gs <dig> isoform are necessary to assimilate the ammonium generated by nitrate reduction within the chloroplast.

only one of the three ptgs <dig> duplicates in poplar, ptgs <dig> , was also preferentially expressed in leaves and interestingly its expression pattern spatially complemented the observed expression pattern of ptgs <dig>  thus, ptgs <dig>  transcripts were particularly abundant in the older leaves located at the basal part of the tree. these results suggest a relevant role of ptgs <dig>  in glutamine biosynthesis associated to photosynthetic metabolism in leaves. furthermore, the presence of light-regulation boxes  <cit>  in the promoter regions of ptgs <dig>  duplicates  is consistent with our data and may explain the above described expression pattern in green leaves.

poplar gs <dig>  was preferentially expressed in roots of young trees suggesting a role for this gene duplicate in primary assimilation of nitrogen from soil, as it has been previously described for other cytosolic gs enzymes in plants  <cit> . interestingly, the relative abundance of ptgs <dig>  transcripts increased significantly  in poplar leaves infected with pseudomonas syringae, whereas the expression of other members of the gs gene family was not affected . the induction of a gs <dig> gene in response to pathogen attack has been previously described  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated in infected tomato leaves and senescing tobacco leaves that the cytosolic isoform involved in nitrogen remobilisation is the product of a gs <dig> gene preferentially expressed in roots  <cit> . these data, together with our work described here suggest that ptgs <dig>  may have a role in nitrogen remobilization during leaf senescence.

in young trees, the maximum expression levels of the twin ptgs <dig>  genes were detected in stems and petioles. furthermore, this member of the poplar gs family exhibited the highest levels of gene expression suggesting it plays an essential role in nitrogen metabolism. the regulatory regions of the ptgs <dig>  duplicates contained ac elements involved in the interaction with members of the r2r <dig> myb factors regulating the transcription of genes for lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . similar cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors have been found to coordinate lignin biosynthesis and nitrogen recycling in pine  <cit> , suggesting that ptgs <dig>  is involved in nitrogen recycling associated to lignification in poplar. transcriptomic analyses have also suggested a role of dof family members in the regulation of genes under conditions resulting in increased lignin deposition  <cit> . the differential regulation of cytosolic gs genes in conifers by a member of the dof family  was recently reported  <cit>  and putative regulatory elements for dof regulation have been identified in poplar gs genes . furthermore, we have found that orthologous dof factors are also involved in the regulation of gs isoforms in poplar . the analysis of gs polypeptides in different poplar organs by 2d-page  largely confirmed the expression patterns determined for the duplicated gs genes. the gs polypeptides were resolved in four major spots with differential accumulation in poplar organs. thus, in the leaves, the gs <dig> and gs <dig> polypeptides displayed pi values in the range of the calculated pi values for the ptgs <dig> and ptgs <dig>  gene expression products . in stems, the predominant gs <dig> polypeptide is predicted to be the expression product of the ptgs <dig>  duplicate whereas the major gs <dig> polypeptide in roots is predicted to be the expression product of ptgs <dig> . this conclusion is supported by the close similarity between the pi values of the gs <dig> isoforms separated in figure  <dig> and the corresponding values deduced from the polypeptides encoded by the ptgs <dig>  and ptgs <dig>  duplicates .

the analysis of transcripts in adult trees during one year of growth  showed that the expression of the poplar gs family members is seasonally regulated. the expression of the ptgs <dig> duplicate was high in leaves in spring when photosynthesis and photorespiration are at maximum levels  <cit> . furthermore, glutamine is required to initiate vegetative protein accumulation during new shoot development in spring  <cit> . developing leaves represent a strong sink for nitrogen during active growth  <cit> . high levels of ptgs <dig>  gene expression were also found in leaves of adult trees in summer and autumn when the expression of ptgs <dig> is very low. these data suggest that the gs <dig>  isoform could play an important role in the redistribution of nitrogen from poplar leaves to stems during summer and autumn. in leaves, stem, buds and bark of adult trees, extremely low levels of ptgs <dig>  transcripts were detected in winter and summer, however, slight increases were observed in spring and autumn. nitrogen mobilisation in poplar is seasonally regulated with recycling and transport of nitrogen compounds from senescing tissues to storage tissues in autumn and remobilisation of nitrogen reserves to support active growth in spring  <cit> . in adult trees, ptgs <dig>  gene expression was seasonally regulated with particularly high transcript levels in spring and autumn. transcript abundance was much high in heterotrophic tissues such as stem, buds and bark, with the exception of senescent leaves in autumn.

the role of cytosolic gs in poplar growth and biomasss production has been reported previously  <cit> . furthermore, enhanced gs expression in poplar results in enhanced efficiency of nitrogen assimilation  <cit> . the role of gs <dig> in ammonium assimilation and nitrogen remobilisation is particularly important in perennial plants that are able to cope with recurrent periods of growth and dormancy. for example, trees divert large amounts of carbon to the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids needed to generate lignin, an important constituent of wood. although lignin does not contain nitrogen, during wood formation there is significant release of nitrogen in the form of ammonium when phenylalanine is deaminated and channeled into lignin biosynthesis and when glycine is decarboxylated in c <dig> metabolism. these two metabolic pathways are active in lignifying cells  <cit> . ammonium ions released must be reintegrated into metabolism in order to maintain high rates of lignification without affecting nitrogen economy  <cit> . in fact, poplar gs <dig> transcripts and polypeptides accumulate in developing xylem cells where activities of enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway and c <dig> metabolism are high and, therefore, ammonium is liberated  <cit> . according to these findings we decided to examine in silico the expression of gs genes during wood formation in hybrid poplar  using the microarray data available in populus db  <cit> . principal component analysis  showed a high degree of co-expression for ptgs <dig>  and relevant genes involved in lignin biosynthesis and c <dig> metabolism. in contrast, other members of the gs family also expressed during poplar wood formation  did not show such correlation. taken together, these data suggest an essential role of ptgs <dig>  in lignifying tissues of poplar.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study the structural and expression analysis of the gs gene family in poplar is presented. the gs gene family consists of  <dig> different genes exhibiting all structural and regulatory elements consistent with their roles as functional genes. our results indicate that the family members are organized in  <dig> groups of duplicated genes,  <dig> of which code for cytosolic gs isoforms  and  <dig> codes for the chloroplast located gs isoform . detailed expression analyses have revealed specific spatial and seasonal patterns of gs gene regulation in poplar . these data provide insights into the metabolic function of gs isoforms in poplar and pave the way for future functional studies.

our analysis shows that populus trichocarpa is the first plant species in which it was observed the complete gs family duplicated. considering all data in the present paper, it appears that gs genes have been highly conserved following whole-genome duplication in poplar. in contrast, duplicated members of other gene families in poplar have rapidly diverged  <cit> . some authors argue that genes involved in transcriptional regulation and developmental genes are preferentially retained  <cit> . it has also been proposed that one of the factors influencing the probability of duplicate gene retention is its connectivity  <cit> . our data suggest that gs duplicates could have been retained in order to increase the amount of enzyme in a particular cell type. this possibility could contribute to the homeostasis of nitrogen metabolism in functions associated to changes in glutamine-derived metabolic products. it has been reported that recently duplicated genes play an important role in the functional compensation of metabolic products in arabidopsis  <cit> . the presence of duplicated gs genes in poplar could also contribute to diversification of the enzymatic properties for a particular gs isoform through the assembly of gs polypeptides into homo oligomeric and/or hetero oligomeric holoenzymes in specific cell types. further research is needed to confirm these hypotheses.
