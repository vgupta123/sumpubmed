BACKGROUND
somatic hybridization provides a means to bypass the problem of sexual incompatibility which prevents the production of many wide hybrids in the plant kingdom. the technique has been successfully demonstrated in a number of intra- and inter-specific, intergeneric, intertribal and even inter-familial combinations  <cit> . the possibility of introgression from exotic sources is of interest not just in the applied field, but also because it provides opportunities for the discovery of novel synthetic pathways for secondary metabolites and signalling compounds.

the medicinal herb swertia mussotii franch is native to tibet, where it has enjoyed a long history of use as a curative for hepatitis  <cit> . its major active compounds have been shown to be swertiamarin, mangiferin and gentiopicroside  <cit> . the economic value of the species is such that there is now a real risk of species extinction as a result of over-exploitation. swertiamarin and gentiopicroside are both iridoid monoterpenoids, but their synthetic pathway has not as yet been characterized in any detail  <cit> . however, many of the reactions in this pathway are known to be catalyzed by p <dig> proteins  <cit> . members of this highly diverse protein family are involved in the synthesis of pigments, antioxidants and defense compounds  <cit> , and one of particular importance for the synthesis of swertiamarin is the enzyme geraniol 10-hydroxylase   <cit> . recently, we isolated a full length cdna clone of s. mussotii g10h , which has the catalytic activity of hydroxylating geraniol  <cit> .

bupleurum scorzonerifolium willd , as a member of the umbelliferae family, also is a very useful herb in chinese traditional medicine, where it is used to treat acesodyne, diminish inflammation, ease fever and increase resistance to hepatic injury and promote immunity  <cit> . we previously reported plant regeneration from cultured b. scorzonerifolium protoplasts  <cit> . and these cultured cell lines with the fast-growing capacities have remained viable for at least  <dig> years, showing a chromosome numbers of 2n =  <dig> in over 90% of cells  <cit> .

our aim was to obtain somatic hybrids between s. mussotii and b. scorzonerifolium. the latter was chosen as the other biparent because it had a rapid growth and similar many secondary metabolic pathways  <cit> . we have used a number of fingerprinting methods to characterize the introgression events achieved by applying this process, and in particular have focussed on the presence of smg10h. finally we sought to establish the relationship between the accumulation of swertiamarin and gentiopicroside and the level of expression of smg10h.

RESULTS
growth and development of somatic fusion nuclei
granular calli were formed from combinations a-d after about two months of culture in liquid p <dig> medium in the dark, but no callus was observed in combination e. once the clones had reached a diameter of  <dig> - <dig> mm , they were transferred to the proliferation medium mb <dig> , where they were maintained through three rounds of sub-culturing before their final transfer to the differentiation medium mb <dig>  a population of  <dig> clones was obtained by this process ; of these only three, all from combination b, were successfully regenerated into plants. these all developed narrow and long leaves, resembling those of b. scorzonerifolium .

genetic characterization of the somatic hybrid calli
esterase isozyme analysis of  <dig> clones indicated that  <dig> had the partial characteristic band of both parents and novel bands and were verifiable as hybrid . a set of  <dig> rapd primers was applied to generate dna fingerprints of the presumptive hybrid calli . fragments from both biparents, as well as fragments not present in either of them, were observed in all of the hybrid clones tested . as 91% of the fragments in the hybrids were derived from the b. scorzonerifolium biparent, and only  <dig> - <dig> % from the s. mussotii biparent, the hybrid genomes were dominated by the recipient species . the construction of donor nuclear genome dnas in these hybrids were similar except hybrid c <dig> . rapd analysis showed in hybrids exposure of uv for  <dig> s, there were  <dig> % donor characteristic bands and  <dig> % new bands , however the numbers were raised to  <dig> % and  <dig> %  in hybrids exposure of uv for  <dig> min .

karyotypes of somatic hybrid clones
the chromosome numbers of b. scorzonerifolium and s. mussotii calli were 11- <dig> and 17- <dig>  respectively . in the clones derived from combination a, the number was no lower than  <dig>  with most carrying 17- <dig> . combination b clones carried 11- <dig> chromosomes, and combination c ones carried 11- <dig> . combination d clones had 11- <dig> . when analysed using gish, the biparental genomes were readily distinguishable from one another . the three regenerable hybrid clones had chimera cells with different chromosome numbers, carrying 11- <dig> intact b. scorzonerifolium, none intact s. mussotii, and 1- <dig> recombined chromosomes . in contrast, the non-regenerable clones carried 11- <dig> intact b. scorzonerifolium, none intact s. mussotii and 5- <dig> recombined chromosomes .

analysis of the cytoplasmic genomes of somatic hybrids
the rflp profiles of mitochondrial dna obtained using restriction enzymes hindiii and hybridized with probes coxi revealed that all of the cell lines analyzed contained b. scorzonerifolium sequences and cell lines b <dig> and c <dig> had donor bands and novel bands . the chloroplast type of the hybrid cell lines was determined using rbcl as a hybridization probe. hybridizations of hindiii digests with rbcl show that all of the cell lines analyzed contained b. scorzonerifolium fragments and 1- <dig> novel fragments, and cell lines b <dig> and b <dig> contained s. mussotii fragments . thus, some recombination within the mitochondrial and chloroplast genome of both parents also occurred in some hybrids.

content of medicinally active compounds
the hplc-based analysis of  <dig> of the hybrid clones determined that none accumulated gentiopicroside . clones b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> contained  <dig> - <dig>  μg/g swertiamarin, while clones b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> contained  <dig> - <dig>  μg/g mangiferin. notably, the mangiferin content of clones b <dig>  b <dig> and c <dig> was higher than that of the callus derived from the s. mussotii biparent .

volatile compounds in the biparent and hybrid clones
the volatile compound content of the hybrid clones, as assessed by gc-ms, largely resembled that of the b. scorzonerifolium biparent . nevertheless, a few donor compounds, in particular coumaron and linoleic acid, were detectable in some of the hybrid clones, along with a small number of compounds  which were not detected in either biparent .

the introgression of p <dig> genes
degenerate pcr analysis was used to detect the p <dig> genes in clones a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  with various contents of swertiamarin and mangiferin . only amplicon of primer cyp <dig> was distinguished among the bipatents and hybrid a <dig> . each cdna template amplified a single fragment in the size range 1100~ <dig> bp in hybrids above and the bipatents using primer cyp <dig>  sequencing identified  <dig> distinct fragments. an analysis of the set of polypeptides predicted from these nucleotide sequences identified their homology to the g10h gene of catharanthus roseus . a full length smg10h sequence of  <dig> bp  was obtained from s. mussotii. the g10h sequences present in clones b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> were identical to that of smg10h . in two clones , the g10h sequence shared  <dig> % homology with smg10h .

up-regulation of smg10h is correlated with the accumulation of swertiamarin
semi-quantitative rt-pcr suggested that the expression smg10h varied among the clones . the swertiamarin content of s. mussotii  was substantially higher than that in the hybrid clones , while clones b <dig> and b <dig> produced more than clone c47; neither swertiamarin nor smg10h expression were detected in clone a <dig>  these results suggest that up-regulation of smg10h is correlated with the accumulation of swertiamarin.

discussion
hybrid clones experience both chromosome elimination and introgression
across a range of hybrid combinations, the regeneration of viable plants has proven to be the main bottleneck in the somatic hybridization process  <cit> . much of the problem appears to be related to the hybrid incompatibility of the biparents. this hybrid incompatibility can be alleviated if sufficient of the donor biparent's chromosomes are either completely eliminated, or at least are broken down so that sub-chromosomal segments become fused with the recipient biparent's chromosome  <cit> . the somatic chromosome number of successful regenerants has been shown to be close to or just slightly lower than that of the recipient biparent  <cit> . here, only three of the population of the  <dig> somatic b. scorzonerifolium / s. mussotii fusion nuclei proved to be regenerable. both the genetic and cytological analyses showed that the constitution of the regenerable hybrid calli was close to that of the recipient parent b. scorzonerifolium, which suggested that large-scale chromosome elimination is necessary to restore the somatic hybrids' ability to regenerate.

uv irradiation of the donor biparent's protoplasts prior to fusion has been shown to encourage chromosomal elimination  <cit> . the hybrid cell lines b <dig> and c <dig> both retained 11- <dig> b. scorzonerifolium chromosomes, none entire s. mussotii, but the former retained 1- <dig> introgression chromosomes, while the latter retained more  introgression chromosomes . this result is consistent with the pattern whereby raising the uv dosage decreases the number of intact donor chromosomes but increases the frequency of donor introgression  <cit> .

characteristics of the hybrid cytoplasmic genome
earlier investigations showed that recombination and  coexistence mitochondria dna from both parents is common in somatic hybrids  <cit> . in contrast, chloroplast dna often had random and equal segregation  <cit> . mixed populations and recombination of chloroplast dna have only rarely been detected  <cit> . in our previous studies, mixed and recombined mitochondrial dna was also seen in wheat somatic hybrids  <cit> . in this study, the mitochondrial and chloroplast dna of both parents also coexisted in most hybrid cell lines. novel dna segments appeared in some hybrids, which may have been the result of recombination of mitochondria and chloroplast dna . we conclude that in the inter-familial hybridization between b. scorzonerifolium and s. mussotii, it is possible to transfer donor mitochondrial and chloroplast genes.

the engineering of medicinally active compounds
somatic hybrids could increase the content of the efficacious compounds from traditional chinese medicinal materials. however, only a few cases succeeded  <cit> . the content of swertiamarin, mangiferin and gentiopicroside varied markedly among the hybrid clones . with respect to swertiamarin, no clone accumulated close to the level which was achieved by the donor calli . however, with respect to mangiferin, five clones  outperformed the donor, two accumulated markedly less , and two  produced no detectable level . the accumulation by the hybrid clones of a number of volatiles associated with the donor species is also indicative of the transfer of whole synthetic pathways from s. mussotii to a genotype which is largely b. scorzonerifolium.

the clones best able to accumulate mangiferin tended to have retained the most introgressed chromosomes . similarly the rapd fingerprinting showed that these clones also inherited the most donor dna . presumably maximizing the yield of the donor's medicinally active compounds in a somatic hybrid clone requires transferring as much donor dna as possible.

the relationship between smg10h expression and swertiamarin content
according to rt-pcr at least, the expression of smg10h varied among the hybrid clones. nevertheless, its level was largely correlated with the accumulation of swertiamarin , implying that the transfer of smg10h alone cannot be expected to be sufficient to guarantee heterologous expression. the implied requirement for other genes in the synthetic pathway underlines the difficulty that a more reductive, tansgenic strategy would face in obtaining the successful production of swertiamarin in a heterologous situation. the identification of hybrid clones able to accumulate this medicinally significant compound therefore confirms the potential of somatic hybridization as a viable route for engineering the production of such molecules in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, somatic hybridization provides a new way to introgression secondary metabolites and related genes in phylogenetic distant species. here we have managed to obtain somatic hybrids of b. scorzonerifolium / s. mussotii with an appreciable content of swertiamarin. the nuclear and cytoplasmic genes from donor were transferred into the genome dna of hybrid clones. the introgression of smg10h was necessary for the accumulation of swertiamarin. therefore, the potential of somatic hybridization is a viable route for engineering the production of such molecules in plants.
