BACKGROUND
acinetobacter baumannii is one of the common bacterial species responsible for hospital-acquired infections   <cit> . the prevalence of multi-drug resistant  a. baumannii in hospitals has been increasing worldwide  <cit> , representing a serious challenge for clinical management and public health. investigation on the clonal relatedness of a. baumannii in local settings could generate useful data to understand the local epidemiology of this opportunistic pathogen and therefore lay a foundation for an effective infection control program. previous studies have focused on the clonal relatedness of a. baumannii but the vast majority of these studies were retrospective and used a collection of isolates either from outbreaks or with little information on their representativeness. for hospitals in sichuan, southwest china, a. baumannii was a huge problem as it was the most common bacterial species associated with hais and accounted for  <dig> % of putative pathogens causing hais in a point prevalence survey  <cit> . outbreaks due to a. baumannii had also been reported in our hospitals  <cit> . a snapshot study was therefore performed to investigate the clonal relatedness of a. baumannii clinical isolates in our local settings.

RESULTS
among  <dig> non-repetitive isolates that were recovered from clinical specimens from june  <dig> to june  <dig>   <dig> in  <dig> hospitals in sichuan and were putatively identified as a. baumannii by automated microbiology systems,  <dig> isolates were validated to be a. baumannii. the vast majority  of the a. baumannii isolates were recovered from sputa or respiratory tract secretions. the remaining six isolates were from ascites, cerebrospinal fluid, drainage, pleural fluid or wound secretions. as for the clinical significance, a. baumannii isolates were considered as either colonizers  or pathogens  causing clinical infections.

about half of the a. baumannii isolates  were non-susceptible to carbapenems , which was in consistence with the 53% carbapenem resistance rate of a. baumannii in the  <dig> report of chinese ministry of health national antimicrobial resistance investigation net   <cit> . many isolates were non-susceptible to sulbactam , ceftazidime , ciprofloxacin  or cotrimoxazole  while all isolates were susceptible to polymyxin and rifampicin and only one isolate was non-susceptible to minocycline.

blaoxa- <dig> was the only acquired carbapenemase gene that was detected. interestingly, it was present in 35/ <dig> carbapenem-non-susceptible and 5/ <dig> carbapenem-susceptible isolates. blaoxa- <dig> has been the most common carbapenemase gene in china, as a previous study reported that  <dig> out of  <dig>  imipenem-non-susceptible a. baumannii isolates collected from  <dig> chinese cities had blaoxa- <dig> <cit> . although blaoxa- <dig> encodes a carbapenemase, this gene has also been detected in carbapenem-susceptible isolates before  <cit> .

the isolates were assigned to  <dig> pulsotypes determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , suggesting quite diverse clonal relatedness . a total of  <dig> sequence types , including  <dig> new sts, were assigned for the isolates using the multi-locus sequence typing  with the pubmlst scheme . as the gdhb gene sequence was not obtained from isolate d <dig> despite repeated attempts using various primer pairs, the st could not be assigned for this isolate. of note, two isolates of the same pulsotypes were assigned to different sts, st <dig> and st <dig>  however, st <dig> and st <dig> were found to be single locus variants to each other. this was in consistence with a previous study  <cit>  reporting that isolates belonging to the same puslotype were not always of the same sts.

st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> were the most common sts in our local settings as each of them were found in three to five hospitals scattered in different regions of the province. st <dig> and st <dig> were prevalent in west china hospital in a study carried out in  <dig>  <cit>  and were also the most common sts in china in  <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, st <dig> had not been identified in china before, although it was found in five hospitals in this study. all our st <dig> isolates except one carried blaoxa- <dig>  st <dig> has recently become one of the two most common sts of carbapenem-non-susceptible isolates in the united states  <cit> , suggesting that st <dig> might be an emerging lineage carrying carbapenem resistance determinants.

st <dig>  a globally-distributed type, and its  <dig> closely-related sts including st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> detected in this study comprised the clonal complex  <dig> , corresponding to the pan-european clone ii   <cit> . although diverse types were detected,  <dig> isolates belonged to the cc <dig>  among the  <dig> sts of cc <dig>   <dig> sts were different from st <dig> only in the gpi locus. isolate information was available for  <dig> of these  <dig> sts,  <dig> of which have only been found in the east or southeast asia at present. the  <dig> non-cc <dig> sts identified in the present study were either singletons  or of a cc that was not a common international clone .

a total of  <dig> sts were assigned in the acinetobacter mlst database , among which isolates identified as a. baumannii belonged to  <dig> sts. the 305-bp gpi locus of a. baumannii appeared to diverge much faster than other loci, with  <dig> gpi allele types comparing to  <dig> glta,  <dig> gyrb,  <dig> gdhb,  <dig> reca,  <dig> cpn <dig> and  <dig> rpod. the occurrence of a different gpi allele for every three sts deposited in the pubmlst database raised the concern that gpi might not be an ideal locus for typing. a previous study  <cit>  also suggested that gpi was not a good candidate for mlst analysis due to recombination. therefore, the diversity of a. baumannii generated by variations in the gpi locus alone might need validation to appreciate whether the diversity is truly meaningful.

isolates belonging to each of  <dig> new sts were assigned to  <dig> sts using the pasteur scheme . among the  <dig> sts determined by the pasteur scheme,  <dig> had not been seen before and therefore were truly new sts. although  <dig> sts of a. baumannii had been assigned in the pubmlst database before this study, a few new sts were still detected in a relatively small collection, suggesting that a. baumannii is likely to be extremely diverse in clonal origins or is undergoing a significant clonal expansion. of note, the isolates with new sts were all carbapenem-susceptible except one. blaoxa- <dig> was not detected in most  isolates of the novel sts. this phenomenon was also present in this study as all the local carbapenem-resistant isolates carrying blaoxa- <dig> belonged to cc <dig>  it has been suggested that among carbapenem-resistant isolates some belonging to certain clonal complexes appeared to be more successful  <cit> .

the diversity of a. baumannii isolates in our settings could provide useful information for infection control. the clonal diversity of a. baumannii and the fact that carbapenem resistance could be transmitted horizontally highlight that “horizontal” infection control measures such as environmental cleaning and hand hygiene should be reinforced to reduce the further spread of a. baumannii. person-to-person transmission of carbapenem-non-susceptible a. baumannii carrying blaoxa- <dig> was indeed identified for several cases as evidenced by the fact that isolates recovered from different patients belonged to the same pulsotype . this suggests that effective infection control measures might need to include rapid identification of blaoxa- <dig> by molecular methods and also justifies contact precautions for patients with carbapenem-resistant isolates.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provided a snapshot of a. baumannii population in clinical samples in our local settings. significantly diverse clonal origins were identified but most isolates belonged to the globally-distributed cc <dig>  among cc <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> were the most common types in our region. the high prevalence of st <dig> carrying blaoxa- <dig> suggests that st <dig> appears to be an emerging lineage mediating the spread of carbapenem resistance. the diversity of a. baumannii suggested that the current mlst scheme might need to be further optimized and in particular the gpi gene might not be an ideal target for acinetobacter mlst.
