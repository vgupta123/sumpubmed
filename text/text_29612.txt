BACKGROUND
populations can exhibit divergent body morphologies in response to environmental cues and these differences may have a significant influence on the performance of individuals  <cit> . a common form of intraspecific divergence in body morphology is resource polymorphism, where morphological variation is associated with segregation in habitat and diet  <cit> . in freshwater fish, divergence of morphs has been frequently shown along the pelagic-littoral habitat axis of lakes   <cit> . foraging in the open water is associated with a high search rate for widely distributed and conspicuous planktonic prey. a more streamlined body occurs in these morphs to facilitate a high attack speed. in contrast, foraging in the structurally complex littoral zones results in a lower search rate for more cryptic benthic prey. thus, a deeper body supports higher manoeuvrability  <cit> . fish species with coexisting pelagic and benthic morphs include three-spined stickleback   <cit> , eurasian perch   <cit>  and arctic charr   <cit> .

predation pressure is another potentially selective force affecting the morphology of organisms. “inducible defenses”  <cit>  have been intensively studied in cladocerans  <cit>  and mussels  <cit>  and are known from a range of fish species. in the presence of predators, crucian carp  develop a deeper body that increases the handling time by predators  <cit> . pumpkinseed sunfish  increase body depth and dorsal spine length when stimulated by permanent predation cues of walleye   <cit> . similar predator-induced responses have been described for perch  <cit> .

phenotypic variation can result from phenotypic plasticity  <cit>  or from heritable adaptations to local selective forces  <cit> . to distinguish between phenotypically plastic and inherited variation, population genomics are widely used to test for the genetic basis of adaptive divergence  <cit> . genome scans are an appropriate method to compare natural populations of non-model organisms that are nonetheless ecologically important, allowing simultaneous screening of many loci throughout the genome and the identification of loci that are putatively under selection  <cit> . as an example, genome scans were used to identify loci associated with morphological variation in european minnows  living in different habitat types  <cit> .

in the present study, we focused on a fish species for which we hypothesized substantial morphological variation due to a variety of locally specific selective forces. the omnivorous cyprinid roach  occurs in many lakes and rivers of the european temperate zone  <cit> . resource polymorphism in roach was recently demonstrated in two lakes  <cit> : individuals inhabiting the pelagic zone were streamlined and fed on zooplankton, whereas those living in the littoral zone had a deeper body and were feeding on benthic invertebrates  <cit> . the dominant feature of near-shore littoral habitats is their structural complexity, created by aquatic macrophytes or woody debris that accumulates in shallow water zones. structural complexity enhances the biomass of prey organisms for omnivorous fish, as the physical structures provide a substrate for epiphytic algae, a primary food source for the invertebrate prey  <cit> .

much previous work has focused on structural complexity within lakes, but complexity also varies among lakes, with high complexity being a typical feature of shallow lakes in particular  <cit> . shallow lakes with low phytoplankton abundance  can contain extended zones of structural complexity because the clear water allows light penetration and facilitates the growth of submerged macrophytes. in contrast, shallow lakes with an abundant phytoplankton community  can have low structural complexity because the lack of light prevents macrophyte establishment. as a result, the differential selective forces operating in littoral and pelagic habitats within single lakes and inducing intralacustrine  divergence may also operate in an interlacustrine  comparison of populations from differently structured shallow lakes.

here we examined morphology , diet  and genetic variation  of roach in four shallow lakes in order to assess ecomorphological divergence and local adaptation among lakes. two lakes were clear and had extensive macrophyte cover while two were turbid and had almost no macrophyte growth. we predicted that roach in clear lakes would feed mainly on benthic macroinvertebrates and have a correspondingly deeper body shape, and that roach from turbid lakes would be more planktivorous and exhibit a more slender shape. we also expected that morphological divergence would be further enhanced by exposure to different predators. the four lakes exhibited a gradient of predation pressure, measured as the proportion of piscivorous fish biomass in total fish assemblages, thus providing a basis to test for an association of body morphology with relative predation pressure. finally, we tested whether the roach populations differed genetically between the lakes, and whether genetic markers were associated with the interlacustrine morphological divergence.

RESULTS
morphometric analysis
morphometric data were obtained from  <dig> individual roach:  <dig> from kleiner gollinsee ,  <dig> from schulzensee ,  <dig> from globsowsee , and  <dig> from kleiner döllnsee . fish from the four lakes differed significantly in their morphology, as revealed by permutation tests of mahalanobis distances . as visualized by graphical output of morphoj, landmarks  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were most divergent among the four populations. as revealed from canonical variate analyses , shape variations of canonical variate  <dig>  were associated with the position of landmark  <dig> and body depth. cv <dig>  was associated with the location of the dorsal  and pelvic fins  . roach from döllnsee  formed a distinct cluster in morphospace, located along the positive values of cv <dig>  as visualized by warped outline drawings, roach from döllnsee had a more elongated and fusiform body shape . furthermore, the dorsal fin was in a more posterior position relative to the average shape of roach. variation in morphospace on cv <dig> was less pronounced and was driven by roach from globsowsee , characterized by a contraction of the dorsal fin and a shift of the pelvic fin toward the anterior part of the body.

results of dfa on size-corrected data are shown.

genetic  analysis
aflp genotypes were obtained for  <dig> roach . we scored  <dig> loci, of which  <dig>  were polymorphic over the four populations . the percentage of polymorphic loci varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> % within the four populations . gene diversity , as calculated by hickory, varied only slightly among lakes, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . bayesian statistics revealed a small but significant genetic differentiation among all four lakes  =  <dig> ;  <dig> - <dig>  95% ci). pairwise differentiation among the lake populations ranged from  <dig>  –  <dig>  with highest differentiation between populations of globsowsee and döllnsee and lowest between schulzensee and döllnsee.

n = number of individuals analyzed, % polymorphic loci refers to the total of  <dig> loci analyzed, hs = gene diversity with credibility intervals calculated by a bayesian approach as implemented in hickory, hs = the mean within-population expected heterozygosity.

outlier analysis using bayescan classified three loci  as outliers under divergent selection . probabilities for the remaining  <dig> loci ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the three outlier loci were present in all four populations, but with differing frequencies. locus  <dig> dominated in gollinsee  and globsowsee , but was rarer in schulzensee  and döllnsee . in contrast, locus  <dig> dominated in döllnsee  and schulzensee , but was rare in globsowsee  and gollinsee . locus  <dig> was highly frequent in döllnsee , gollinsee  and schulzensee , but less frequent in globsowsee . linkage disequilibrium  was estimated for all possible pairs of the three outlier loci, but among the  <dig>  pair-wise tests, only one locus pair in gollinsee showed a significant linkage .

association of shape with predation pressure and genetic markers
predation risk was highest for roach in döllnsee , because predator density was highest and roach were small in this lake. lowest risk was in schulzensee , with intermediate risks in gollinsee and globsowsee . across the four lakes, shape and estimated predation pressure were significantly associated , rv =  <dig> ; permutation test against the null hypothesis of independence with  <dig> randomization runs: p =  <dig> ) . in lakes with higher predation pressure, the deviation in shape was attributable to body form and fin insertion.

principal coordinate analysis  of the  <dig> polymorphic aflp loci aggregated  <dig> % of variation along pcoa axis  <dig> , pcoa <dig>  and pcoa <dig> . cv <dig> of shape analysis was significantly smaller in globsowsee, schulzensee and gollinsee than in döllnsee , but aggregated genotypes  did not contribute to shape variations . interactions between pcoa <dig> and the lakes were likewise not significant . similarly, pcoa <dig> of genotypes and its interactions with lakes were not significant predictors of shape  , but cv <dig> again significantly differed between döllnsee and the other three lakes in this analysis . general linear models on cv <dig> as the dependent dominant shape variable and lake and each of the three outlier loci as predictors confirmed that the genotype had no effect on shape of fish, because the effect of the outlier loci was not significant in any case .

roach diet and association with morphological data
diet composition  was analyzed from gollinsee  and schulzensee . roach from gollinsee fed almost exclusively on benthic prey , as indicated by gc  and the isotopic mixing model . in schulzensee, the contribution of benthic and pelagic food sources was similar , although gc indicated a slightly higher use of prey from benthic habitats  than did the isotopic mixing model . the proportions of ingested benthic and pelagic prey items  differed significantly between both lakes .

pls analysis of shape as the first block and gut contents of roach from gollinsee and schulzensee as the second block revealed no correlation of shape with diet composition . similarly, pls with shape as the first block and isotopic ratios as second block did not show a significant correlation .

discussion
body morphologies differed in all four studied roach populations in shallow lakes, in particular with respect to overall body form and anterior-posterior location of the fins. our analyses suggest that these morphological differences reflect a gradient in exposure to predation risk among the lakes, as shape and predation pressure were significantly correlated. contrary to our predictions, fish morphology was not correlated with resource use. therefore, we suggest that the strong morphological divergence among lakes in roach was primarily driven by differences in predation risk. the four populations exhibited small genetic differences. however, we did not find evidence that genetic differentiation and morphological variation among lakes were associated; suggesting that shape variation in roach did not have a heritable component detectable in our analysis.

roach body shapes were most distinct in döllnsee, the lake characterized by highest predator abundance. there are several examples for induced morphological defenses in fish, including a plastic response to achieve a size refuge against predators limited by gape-size  <cit> . here, we observed a more slender body and a more caudal position of the dorsal fin. in contrast to morphological changes that prevent handling of prey by predators  <cit>  we consider this body form to be advantageous for flight. to escape a predator attack, most fish show a similar fast-start behavior of sudden, high-energy swimming bursts, called a “c-start”  <cit> . during a c-start, fish bend into a “c” shape  and then produce a propulsive stroke of the caudal region in the opposite direction . this is facilitated by a slender body form and a relatively shallow anterior body and head region, as these contribute minimally to drag  <cit> . thrust can be increased if the dorsal fin is in a caudal position  <cit> ; however, domenici et al.  <cit>  demonstrated higher speed and acceleration in crucian carp of deeper body forms, attributable to a high percentage of muscle mass. therefore, there seems to be a trade-off between a streamlined body that reduces drag and a deeper body of high muscle mass that increases burst.

a previous study compared morphology of one-year-old roach raised under experimental conditions in the presence and absence of pike  predators  <cit> . the main differences were changes of dorsal fin displacement and morphological responses similar to our findings. the authors suggested that these morphological changes affect swimming speed and manoeuvrability in roach  <cit> . contrary to our study, they detected a wider anal fin in roach exposed to predators. adaptations to faster swimming seem advantageous, as roach were found to increase activity and even show the tactic of jumping out of the water when threatened by a predator  <cit> . comparable adaptations to faster predator escape as a response to high predator abundances were also found in western mosquitofish   <cit>  and in galaxias platei <cit> , where caudal regions were enlarged to enhance burst performance. a recent review  <cit>  concluded that most of the observed predator-induced morphological defenses are purely a by-product of swimming activity. prey swim less when predators are present, resulting in lower feeding rates or decreased metabolism, leading to reduced growth. we cannot exclude that variation in roach morphology between the lakes reflects differences in swimming activity ; however, roach from döllnsee, where predation risk was highest, had morphologies that appear better adapted to rapid and extended swimming, which contrasts the conclusion that predation risk always induces reduced swimming activity of prey.

body morphology was not associated with structural complexity in the lakes created by macrophyte coverage, with little evidence for an association of morphology and diet composition in this omnivorous species. gut content and stable isotopes both suggested that benthic invertebrates dominated the diet of roach in the two lakes analyzed, whereas shape data significantly differed between these populations. similar studies of fishes mainly focused on intralacustrine  morphological divergence and resource polymorphism, with specialization on benthic food usually associated with a preference for littoral habitats with high structural complexity. intralacustrine resource polymorphism driven by intraspecific competition has been studied in roach of two swedish lakes  <cit> . benthivorous individuals from the littoral zone had a deeper body compared to planktivorous individuals from the pelagic zone. similarly, pumpkinseed sunfish produce molluscivorous and a planktivorous morphotypes to decrease intraspecific competition  <cit> . ours is the first study of interlacustrine  divergence of body morphology in roach of which we are aware, but similar morphological divergence between lakes has been reported for populations of three-spined sticklebacks in alaska, usa  <cit> . very shallow lakes, where most of the stickleback habitat is structurally complex, were inhabited by individuals of the benthic form, characterized by a deeper body that favors maneuverability, whereas the limnetic form with a narrower body that reduces drag during prolonged swimming was found in deeper lakes with large areas of open waters  <cit> .

a possible explanation for the lack of correlation between resource use and body shape here could be the spatial dimension of the systems studied. the four lakes we studied were small  and relatively shallow. roach may be able to easily exploit the resources from all habitats because near shore and offshore sites are usually less than 100 m apart. furthermore, seasonal and annual changes in resource abundance require flexibility in resource use, perhaps counteracting any selective advantage gained by specialization. a high diet flexibility of roach is supported by the fact that guts of roach in the lake with almost no macrophytes  contained even more benthic prey than those from fish in the lake with intermediate macrophyte coverage . a more balanced diet composition with resources from both littoral and pelagic origin was obtained by applying the mixing model based on stable isotope analysis. therefore, in systems where resources are spatially dispersed and temporally variable, selection may favor morphological shapes that support omnivory rather than discrete morphotypes specialized on a particular prey and habitat type.

many previous studies found morphological changes to be phenotypically plastic  <cit> , although a few studies have demonstrated a heritable component  <cit> . in our dataset, we did not find any statistical association of shape differences with aggregated or outlier-specific genotypes among the lakes. however, the three outlier loci occurred in all populations, although with differing frequencies, suggesting that the allele frequencies of these loci are not the result of neutral genetic drift. there is some inherent uncertainty in aflp studies, such as false scoring of alleles due to differences in pcr efficiency  or peak overlap   <cit> . furthermore, reduced precision during sample preparation due to sampling mix-up, pipetting or contamination may cause genotyping errors  <cit> . nevertheless, we have no indication that false positives had a strong influence on our results, because the reproducibility was 98% within the randomly chosen repeated  <dig> % of samples.

the proportion of outlier loci  fits within the range of reported outliers of former studies   <cit> . in a comparison of three available statistical programs, bayescan  showed the lowest rates of false positives  <cit> , and hence we consider the three loci found in our study to be reliable . aflp outlier loci have been linked to morphological diversification in other studies of fish, including european minnows in lake and stream habitats  <cit>  or in sympatric lake whitefish  ecotypes  <cit> . a similarly strong association between morphotype and genotype could not be confirmed for roach in our study. it is possible that our aflp markers simply failed to include genomic regions that are associated with the shape variations between the lakes. alternatively, the lack of association between genotype and phenotype may suggest a plastic response to predation pressure. compared to fixed genetic controls, plastic responses to environmental pressures are advantageous when predatory regimes are variable  <cit> . strong interannual variability of predation pressure is likely in the communities analyzed here because these small and shallow lakes are characterized by frequent fish kills during strong winters that can substantially reduce predator abundance  <cit> .

overall, the extent of genetic divergence between populations is determined through a mixture of adaptive and neutral processes  <cit> . local adaptation is achieved through environmental filtering of genotypes  <cit> , whereas neutral processes include drift-migration equilibrium wherein landscape isolation plays a role in reducing gene flow   <cit> . we did not find evidence for a dominance of neutral processes and ibd in our data. the geographical distance between the four lakes is very limited , and the two lakes situated only 4 km apart  exhibited intermediate genetic divergence . thus, we conclude that interlacustrine morphological diversification of the four roach populations is mainly led through processes related to local environments of each lake  rather than neutral process due to geographic isolation between the lakes.

CONCLUSIONS
we observed divergent morphologies in omnivorous fish populations among four shallow lakes. our results support previous studies suggesting that predation risk may play a more important role than habitat and diet in shaping body morphology of this prey species. in the case of roach inhabiting small and shallow lakes, we consider these morphological changes advantageous for fast escapes and thus directly cued by predation. furthermore, we did not find evidence that the observed morphological divergence had a heritable component.
