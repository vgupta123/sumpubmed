BACKGROUND
normal somatic cells possess a limited proliferative life span after which they enter a state of irreversible growth arrest. this process, known as replicative senescence, can be signaled by shortened telomeres that result from repeated rounds of dna replication in the absence of telomerase expression. once the telomeres erode to an average size of 4– <dig> kilobases, senescence is triggered and cells stop dividing  <cit> . replicative senescence plays an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues by limiting the excessive clonal expansion of cells  <cit> . however, the accumulation of senescent cells is also believed to contribute to the age-related decline in tissue function  <cit> . replicative senescence can therefore be viewed as both a mechanism of tumor suppression and a contributor in pathologies associated with age. the role of replicative senescence in tumorigenesis is highlighted by the fact that the most common mutations in human cancers occur in genes encoding p <dig> and members of the prb pathway, which are the critical effectors of replicative senescence  <cit> .

a number of fundamental metabolic and biochemical changes occur as a cell enters senescence and begins to age. numerous studies have reported dramatic changes in protein turnover. the proteasome, the primary non-lysosomal protease responsible for degrading intracellular proteins including misfolded, oxidized and ubiquitinated proteins, has been reported to decline in function with age  <cit> . several reports have indicated that the expression of certain proteasome subunits drops after cells enter replicative senescence  <cit> . in addition, proteasome inhibition, or "clogging", has been observed as aging cells accumulate damaged proteins  <cit> . the resulting drop in protein turnover may contribute to the accumulation of protein deposits, such as lipofuscin, which can further compromise cell function  <cit> . in addition, the drop in proteasome activity is likely to alter the activity of numerous cellular signal transduction pathways that involve the proteasome.

replicative senescence is accompanied by many changes in gene expression that contribute to the senescence-associated phenotypes. of particular importance are the cell cycle inhibitors p16ink4a and p21waf <dig>  which are induced upon replicative senescence to halt cell proliferation  <cit> . interestingly, many genes involved in the regulation of cellular growth arrest and differentiation are regulated by histone acetylation. for example, in proliferating fibroblasts, the stable association of hdac <dig> with the sp1/sp <dig> transcription factors bound to the p21waf <dig> promoter suppresses p21waf <dig> expression. upon senescence, hdac <dig> is displaced from to the p21waf <dig> promoter, due in part to the actions of p <dig>  <cit> .

hdac inhibitors have long been known to induce differentiation, growth arrest, and apoptosis in cancer cells  <cit> . the aberrant utilization of hdacs is believed to be a contributing factor in carcinogenesis. however, only recently have hdac inhibitors been shown to induce premature senescence in normal human fibroblasts  <cit> . hdacs may therefore play a critical role in modulating cell physiology during the aging process, as well as contribute to the cellular changes associated with transformation. here we examine the interplay between cellular hdac activity and a number of phenotypic changes that accompany cell senescence. we find that replicative senescence is accompanied by a drop in cellular hdac <dig> expression, the activation of the cell cycle inhibitory protein p21waf <dig>  and a reduction in cellular proteasome activity and subunit expression. the critical role of hdacs in regulating these events is supported by the finding that hdac inhibitors selectively trigger these changes in pre-senescent, but not post-senescent cells. our findings indicate that a drop in hdac expression may be a critical event in mediating the transition from a proliferating to a senescent phenotype.

RESULTS
hdac inhibitors induce a senescence-like phenotype in proliferating wi- <dig> cells
hdac inhibitors can induce growth arrest in many cell types, and have recently been reported to induce a senescence-like state in normal human fibroblasts  <cit> . therefore, we sought to determine if the hdac inhibitors butyrate and tsa could induce premature senescence in proliferating wi- <dig> cells. one molecular marker of senescence in normal human fibroblasts is p21waf <dig> expression  <cit> . as shown in figure 1a, treatment with butyrate or tsa for  <dig> hours induced the expression of p21waf <dig> in proliferating wi- <dig> cells. distinct morphological changes also occurred when wi- <dig> cells enter replicative senescence. senescent cells became larger and assumed irregular shapes, while proliferating wi- <dig> cells formed long and striated parallel arrays . as shown in figure 1b, treatment of young wi- <dig> cells with hdac inhibitors butyrate or tsa caused cells to rapidly acquire a senescent-like morphology.

another biomarker for replicative senescence is senescence-associated-β-galactosidase  activity  <cit> . young wi- <dig> cells were cultured for  <dig> days in  <dig>  mm butyrate or  <dig> days in  <dig>  μm tsa. these concentrations allowed for the prolonged exposure of wi- <dig> cells to the hdac inhibitors with minimal cytotoxicity. as shown in figure  <dig>  young wi- <dig> cells cultured in the presence of either hdac inhibitor acquired the perinuclear staining for sa-β-gal activity normally associated with senescent cells. untreated proliferating wi- <dig> cells propagated in parallel had no sa-β-gal activity . this data further supports the findings that hdac inhibition induces a senescent-like phenotype in proliferating fibroblasts  <cit> .

proteasome activity is reduced in senescent wi- <dig> cells
declines in proteasome function during senescence and aging have been observed in cultured cells and in tissues from a variety of organisms  <cit> . our aim was to verify and characterize the changes in proteasome activity following senescence in the human fibroblast wi- <dig> cell line. cytosolic extracts prepared from proliferating and senescent wi- <dig> cells were tested for proteasome activity using the synthetic substrate suc-llvy-amc  <cit> . as shown in figure 3a, proteasome activity was significantly lower  in the older wi- <dig> cells. since a decrease in proteasome activity may also cause a general increase in the presence of polyubiqitinated proteins, cytsolic extracts from proliferating and senescent wi- <dig> cells were analyzed by immunoblotting for polyubiquitinated proteins. as indicated in figure 3b, the accumulation of high molecular weight ubiquitin-conjugated proteins was accentuated in the senescent wi- <dig> cells, which is consistent with a drop in proteasome activity.

previous reports have documented that certain proteasome subunits are down-regulated in senescent wi- <dig> cells  <cit> . however, these analyses were limited to only a select subset of proteasome subunits. we therefore analyzed the expression of each constitutive β-type subunit to further characterize differences in proteasome subunit expression between proliferating and senescent cells . as shown in figure  <dig>  senescent wi- <dig> cells expressed lower levels of the three catalytic proteasome subunits: β <dig> , β <dig> , and β <dig> . however, the expression levels of the other β-type subunits did not change in the older cells. figure  <dig> also shows the increased expression of p21waf <dig> in senescent wi- <dig> cells  <cit> . the protein expression levels of the β <dig> subunit were additionally quantified by optical densitometry from immunoblots . the β <dig> protein levels were reduced by ~30% in senescent wi- <dig> cells, which corresponds to the ~30% decline in proteasome activity .

senescent wi- <dig> cells are resistant to hdac inhibitors
the expression of p21waf <dig> is regulated by aceytlation and readily activated by hdac inhibitors  <cit> . we therefore determined the effect of hdac inhibitors on p21waf <dig> expression in proliferating and senescent wi- <dig> cells. as shown in figure 6a, treatment with hdac inhibitors butyrate or tsa induced p21waf <dig> expression in proliferating wi- <dig> cells. however, in senescent cells the endogenous levels of p21waf <dig> were high and not further enhanced by either hdac inhibitor . these data suggest that p21waf1activation in senescent cells may result from a reduction in cellular hdac activity.

hdac inhibitors have also been reported to suppress proteasome activity and subunit expression in several transformed cell lines  <cit> . we hypothesized that hdac inhibitors may suppress proteasome activity in proliferating wi- <dig> cells, as well. cytosolic extracts were prepared from young wi- <dig> cells treated with butyrate or tsa for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours. the synthetic substrate suc-llvy-amc was then utilized to measure proteasome activity in each sample. as shown in figure 6b, proteasome activity decreased in young wi- <dig> cells treated with either butyrate or tsa. to determine if senescent wi- <dig> cells were also sensitive to hdac inhibitor-induced proteasome suppression, the proteasome activity of senescent wi- <dig> cells was analyzed following butyrate or tsa treatment. although proteasome activity was lower in senescent wi- <dig> cells , it was significantly less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of the hdac inhibitors . this data suggests that replicative senescence and hdac inhibitor-induced senescence impacts proteasome activity through a common pathway.

reduced expression of the β <dig> proteasome subunit in proliferating wi- <dig> cells by hdac inhibitors
we determined whether the hdac inhibitors butyrate and tsa could suppress the expression of the catalytic β <dig> subunit of the proteasome in proliferating wi- <dig> cells. the immunoblots in figure 7a indicate that β <dig> expression levels decreased in these cells following butyrate or tsa treatments. the expression levels of the β <dig> subunit were additionally quantified by optical densitometry from immunoblots . this data indicates that reduced proteasome activity following hdac inhibition  may be due in part to reduced proteasome subunit expression.

hdac <dig> is down-regulated in senescent wi- <dig> cells
the class i histone deacetylase protein hdac <dig> is a component of the corepressor complex involved in suppressing the transcription of p21waf <dig> and other cell cycle inhibitory genes  <cit> . we therefore determined if hdac <dig> expression was altered upon replicative senescence. as shown in figure  <dig>  hdac <dig> levels decreased in senescent wi- <dig> cells.  the levels of another class i histone deacetylase, hdac <dig>  was found to be equivalent in pre- and post-senescent cells . the drop in hdac <dig> expression may contribute to the induction of p21waf <dig> in senescent wi- <dig> cells . likewise, the decline in hdac <dig> may contribute to the appearance of other senescent phenotypes, such as a drop in proteasome activity.

discussion
replicative senescence marks the end of the proliferative life span of normal cells. this is accompanied by distinct alterations in the pattern of gene expression. it has been suggested that changes in gene expression during senescence and aging may result in part from alterations in protein acetylation  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates a potential mechanism by which hdacs  contribute to the senescence phenotype. as wi- <dig> cells senesce, hdac activity decreases to facilitate changes in gene expression. reductions in hdac levels, in association with increased transcriptional activity of p <dig> in senescent cells, contributes to the induction of p21waf <dig> expression and subsequent growth arrest  <cit> . this model also envisions hdacs contributing to the age-related decline in proteasome activity, since hdac inhibitors can reduce proteasome expression and activity  <cit> .

the identification of hdacs as a component in replicative senescence, and hence growth arrest, is interesting because data has shown that hdacs can promote tumor growth and stem cell proliferation. for example, it has been reported that hdac <dig> overexpression occurs in 68% of primary human gastric cancer, and contributes to colony formation and proliferation of prostate and breast cancer cells  <cit> . some transformed cell types may exaggerate the expression of hdacs to circumvent replicative senescence. in this regard, cancer cells are similar to stem cells, where hdac <dig> is required for full cellular growth potential  <cit> . this further supports the idea that replicative senescence, and the associated decline in hdac <dig> expression, has a tumor suppressing role  <cit> .

it is not entirely clear how hdacs are regulating proteasome subunit expression. in yeast, a common mode of transcriptional regulation of the proteasomal subunits has already been identified  <cit> . nearly all the yeast subunit homologs have been found to possess proteasome-associated control elements within their promoters. the transcription factor rpn <dig> has been identified as the component within yeast involved in binding these elements to modulate gene transcription  <cit> . remarkably, no homolog of rpn <dig> has been identified in humans. however, it is still possible that another common transcriptional mechanism is shared amongst the catalytic subunits in human cells. the activity of these putative regulatory proteins may be regulated by acetylation, such that an increased level of acetylation reduces proteasome subunit expression.

our analysis of hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> indicates that replicative senescence is not accompanied by a global decline in hdac expression. rather, it appears to occur through the down-regulation of hdac <dig>  and potentially other hdacs. other groups have also reported a senescence-specific form of the hdac <dig> protein  <cit> . in addition, the nad+-dependent sir <dig> histone deacetylase has been identified to contribute to the replicative life-span in yeast, thus suggesting that the mammalian sir2-related class iii hdacs may contribute to senescence in normal human cell types, as well  <cit> . it should be noted that it is not clear if the decline in hdac <dig> is a cause or a consequence of replicative senescence. however, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that age-related modulations in hdac levels could be a contributing factor in senescence. further analysis of individual hdac proteins may identify their individual functions within the senescence machinery. anti-aging and anti-cancer strategies may be aimed at increasing or decreasing the activity of specific hdac proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that cellular hdac activity regulates numerous phenotypic changes associated with cellular senescence. reduced cellular hdac expression and activity, in association with other events, may be important for mediating the transition to a senescent phenotype.
