BACKGROUND
shigella flexneri is the major pathogen causing bacillary dysentery  in developing countries. it is estimated that there are  <dig> million shigellosis cases annually in asia, resulting in  <dig>  deaths, the majority of which are children under 5 years old  <cit> . the o-polysaccharide chain of the lipopolysaccharide  called o-antigen is an important and highly variable cell component presented on the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. it provides the basis for serotyping of s. flexneri, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of shigellosis  <cit> . the immune response against the o-antigen can induce protection that makes it a promising candidate as a component of shigellosis vaccines  <cit> .

based on the composition and structures of the o-antigens, s. flexneri can be divided into two main groups: one for serotypes 1– <dig>  x, y, and  <dig>  and the other for serotype  <dig>  members of the former group share a linear o-polysaccharide backbone composed of tetrasaccharide repeats  of one n-acetylglucosamine  and three l-rhamnose residues : →2)-α-l-rhapiii--α-l-rhapii--α-l-rhapi--β-d-glcpnac- to different sugars of the tetrasaccharide backbone gives rise to diverse o-antigen structures and, correspondingly, to various serotypes  <cit> . serotype  <dig> has a different linear o-polysaccharide backbone with a tetrasaccharide repeat containing one residue each of n-acetylgalactosamine  and galacturonic acid  and two rhamnose residues : →2)-α-l-rhapiii--α-l-rhapii--β-d-galpa--β-d-galpnac--α-l-rhapiii--α-l-rhapii disaccharide fragment is common for the o-polysaccharides of both groups of s. flexneri. the observed o-antigen distinction reflects the genetic diversity of s. flexneri and different evolutionary origins of serotype  <dig> compared to other serotypes, which belong to different lineages of shigella clones of escherichia coli  <cit> .

similar to other shigella species, the o-antigen gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of the s. flexneri o-polysaccharide backbone is located between the housekeeping genes galf and gnd on the chromosome  <cit> . it contains three main classes of genes:  genes of nucleotide sugar biosynthesis pathways;  glycosyltransferase genes; and  o-unit processing genes including those for o-antigen flippase  and o-antigen polymerase . serotypes 1– <dig>  x, y, and  <dig> have similar o-antigen gene clusters whereas in serotype  <dig> the gene cluster is different, resulting in the two dissimilar o-antigen backbone structures of s. flexneri  <cit> . the factors responsible for modification of the backbone including o-antigen glucosylation , o-acetylation , and phosphorylation  are carried by prophages, transposon-like structures, or plasmids outside of the o-antigen gene cluster  <cit> .

modification of the o antigen by o-acetylation has been also found in the serotype  <dig>  it was first reported at position  <dig> of rhaiii  <cit> , and later found that rhaiii is partially 3-o-acetylated  and partially 4-o-acetylated   <cit> . the degree of 3/4-o-acetylation varies between strains and is thought to contribute to the serospecificity, which gives rise to a serological distinction between strains with lower  and higher  degrees of o-acetylation at position  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> .

a similar 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii also occurs in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, and y of s. flexneri  <cit> , and the o-acyltransferase-encoding gene, named oacb, has recently been found to be responsible for this modification in these serotypes  <cit> . oacb is carried by a transposon-like structure located upstream of the adra gene on the chromosome  <cit> . further studies have indicated that the 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii is widespread in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a,  <dig>  and y and confers to the bacterium a novel antigenic determinant provisionally named group o-factor  <dig>  <cit> . however, the oacb gene cannot be detected from serotype  <dig> strains carrying 3/4-o-acetylation  <cit> , indicating that another unknown gene is involved in the o-antigen modification in this serotype.

considering that the o-antigen plays a key role in the serospecificity and virulence of shigella, elucidation of o-antigen modification mechanisms is important for understanding the o-antigen biosynthesis, antigenicity, and pathogenicity of s. flexneri, as well as for shigellosis vaccine development. in this study, we identified the acyltransferase gene, named oacc, which mediates the 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii in serotype  <dig>  the oacc gene is located in a phage-like structure on the chromosome and has an interchangeable function with the oacb gene of serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, and y. however, pcr screening indicated that gene oacc is specific to serotype  <dig>  whereas oacb is specific to the other serotypes of s. flexneri.

RESULTS
identification of an o-acyltransferase gene, oacc, on the chromosome of s. flexneri serotype 6
although the o-antigen of s. flexneri serotype  <dig> carries 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii  <cit> , the oacb gene responsible for the same modification in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, and y could not be detected from serotype  <dig> strains  <cit> . to identify potential factors associated with 3/4-o-acetylation of serotype  <dig>  we used the oacb protein sequence of serotype 2a strain sf <dig>  to search against the genbank protein database. a predicted acyltransferase protein encoded by gene sgf_ <dig> of s. flexneri strains cdc 796– <dig> and sfcch060_ <dig> of cch <dig> was found to show the highest homology  to oacb . blast search revealed that these strains both carry within their genomes the serotype  <dig> o-antigen-specific gene wzx  <cit> , indicating that they belong to serotype  <dig>  data presented below suggest that this oacb homolog is responsible for the 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii in serotype 6; hence it was named oacc and the encoding gene oacc, following the designations for oacb and oacb  <cit> .figure  <dig>

oacc possesses conserved domains of the acyltransferase family . it showed 28-39% identity to predicted acyltransferases of pseudomonas sp., dechloromonas aromatica, flavobacterium columnare, and some other species. oacc was also compared to oac , an o-acetyltransferase responsible for 2-o-acetylation on rhai giving rise to group  <dig> antigenic determinant in s. flexneri serotypes 1b, 3a, 3b, 4b, and 7b  <cit> . the two proteins presented higher homology in the three regions conserved among the inner membrane trans-acylase family proteins   <cit>  . in particular, the residues r <dig> and r <dig>  which are known to be critical for oac functioning  <cit> , are conserved in the three known acyltransferases .

to reveal a correlation between the presence of oacc and 3/4-o-acetylation in serotype  <dig>  we performed pcr screening using the oacc- <dig> primer pair of serotype  <dig> strains g <dig>  g <dig>  and  <dig> , all of which are known to carry 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii. the expected pcr products  were amplified from all three strains, and the pcr product sequences were fully identical to that of the sgf_ <dig> gene of cdc 796– <dig>  pcr screening of another  <dig> serotype  <dig> isolates collected in our laboratory showed that all isolates were pcr positive . the  <dig> strains were also positive for o-factor  <dig>  and therefore should carry 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii. these results, combined with the functional analysis data described below, suggest that oacc is responsible for the 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii in serotype  <dig> table  <dig>

deletion and complementation analysis identifies the 3/4-o-acetylation function of oacc in serotype 6
to confirm the function of the oacc gene, we performed oacc deletion and complementation assay on serotype  <dig> strain  <dig> using the one-step inactivation of chromosomal genes method  <cit> . the kan-oacc primer pair  carrying sequences complementary to oacc was employed to amplify the aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase encoding gene  from plasmid prs <dig>  the pcr amplicon  transferred into strain  <dig> would recombine with the oacc gene resulting in a part of the oacc gene sequence  being replaced by the kmr gene. the deletion mutant 51579Δoacc was selected on chloramphenicol and kanamycin-containing plate and detected by pcr amplification of the oacc gene using the oacc- <dig> and oacc- <dig> primer pairs . the product of 350-bp which was amplified from the wild-type strain, was not obtained from the mutant 51579Δoacc using the oacc- <dig> primer pair. however, when the oacc- <dig> primer pair was used, a pcr product of  <dig> -bp was amplified from 51579Δoacc, which, as expected, was longer than that from the wild-type strain  <dig> . the oacc deletion was further confirmed by sequencing analysis of the  <dig> -bp amplicon from the 51579Δoacc mutants.table  <dig>

the serological features of the mutants were determined by an agglutination assay using shigella antisera of seiken and anti-o-factor  <dig> serum. the deletion of oacc did not affect the type vi antigenicity, with the 51579Δoacc mutant presenting the same antiserum vi reactivity as the parental  <dig> . this observation is consistent with and confirm the results of hygge blakeman et al.  <cit> , who found that e. coli o <dig>  present the same monoclonal antibody masf vi- <dig> reactivity. in contrast, compared to the wild type, the mutant lost the reactivity with 3/4-o-acetylated rhaiii-specific anti-o-factor  <dig> serum . the o-factor  <dig> antigenicity of the 51579Δoacc mutant was restored by complementation with a functional oacc-carrying plasmid psqz <dig> .table  <dig>

the o-factor  <dig> antigenicity was further confirmed by an immunoblotting assay. the lpss samples were resolved on 15% sds-page gel and visualized by silver-staining . a typical ladder-like banding pattern of an lps with an o-antigen composed of various numbers of o-units was observed for all strains with no obvious difference between the parental strain and oacc deletion and complementation mutants. in western blot, anti-o-factor  <dig> serum recognized the ladder-like lps bands of the functional oacc-carrying strains  but not the 51579Δoacc deletion mutant .figure  <dig>

these findings were confirmed by structure analysis using 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy of the o-polysaccharides isolated from the lpss. in the spectra of the wild-type  <dig> o-polysaccharide, there were signals for the 3-o-acetyl group  and 4-o-acetyl group  at δh  <dig>  and  <dig> , δС  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. due to electron deshielding effects of o-acetylation  <cit> , parts of the signals for h-3/c- <dig> and h-4/c- <dig> of rhaiii were shifted downfield to δh/δС  <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig>  as compared with their positions in the non-o-acetylated rhaiii at δh/δС  <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig> , respectively . the degrees of o-acetylation determined by relative intensities of the 1h nmr signals for various o-acetylated and non-o-acetylated rhaiii forms were ~50% at position  <dig> and ~30% at position  <dig>  the 1h and 13c nmr spectra of the 51579Δoacc mutant o-polysaccharide lacked any signals for o-acetyl groups, and the positions of resonances of h-3/c- <dig> and h-4/c- <dig> of rhaiii at δh/δС  <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig> , respectively, indicated that they did not undergo any deshielding. the spectra of the 51579Δoacc_psqz <dig> transformant were essentially identical to those of the wild type. therefore, the 51579Δoacc mutant lost the 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii, and this modification was restored by complementation of the mutant with a functional oacc gene .figure  <dig>

it has been proposed that the degree of 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii contributes to the serospecificity of serotype  <dig>  which can be divided into subtypes  <dig> and 6a with low and high degree of 3/4-o-acetylation, respectively  <cit> . we amplified and sequenced the oacc gene in serotype 6a strain g <dig> and serotype  <dig> strain g <dig>  <cit> , and found no nucleotide difference between them. hence, the variation in the degree of 3/4-o-acetylation is not due to sequence variation of the oacc gene, and most likely, results from different storage and/or cultivation conditions.

oacc of serotype  <dig> has the interchangeable 3/4-o-acetylation function with oacb of serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, and y
to determine the distribution of oacc in s. flexneri, pcr screening of  <dig> strains of various non- <dig> serotypes  was performed using the oacc- <dig> primer pair. no positive amplification was observed in any of the strains tested, including all  <dig> o-factor  <dig> positive strains of serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, and y, which do carry 3/4-o-acetylation . we also pcr screened  <dig> strains of s. dysenteriae ,  <dig> strains of s. boydii ,  <dig> strains of s. sonnei and  <dig> strains of e. coli  , and found that all were oacc negative. these data, combined with results of our previous studies on the oacb distribution  <cit> , indicate that oacc is specific to serotype  <dig>  whereas oacb to the other serotypes of s. flexneri.

to elucidate whether the oacc protein has the interchangeable 3/4-o-acetylation function with oacb, we transferred the oacc-carrying plasmid psqz <dig> into sf301Δoacb   <cit> , and the oacb-carrying plasmid psqz <dig>  <cit>  into 51579Δoacc, to construct complementation transformants sf301Δoacb_ psqz <dig> and 51579Δoacc_ psqz <dig>  respectively . the serological features of the transformants were determined by an agglutination assay using shigella antisera of seiken  and anti-o-factor  <dig> serum, and compared to those of the sf301Δoacb_ psqz <dig>  <cit>  and 51579Δoacc_ psqz <dig> transformants . it was found that both sf301Δoacb_ psqz <dig> and 51579Δoacc_ psqz <dig> acquired the agglutination reactivity with anti-o-factor  <dig> serum, and the serological features of the oacc transformants sf301Δoacb_ psqz <dig> and 51579Δoacc_ psqz <dig> were same as those of the oacb transformants sf301Δoacb_ psqz <dig> and 51579Δoacc_ psqz <dig>  respectively . in the immunoblotting assay, anti-o-factor  <dig> serum recognized the ladder-like lps bands of sf301Δoacb_ psqz <dig>  sf301Δoacb_ psqz <dig>  51579Δoacc_ psqz <dig>  and 51579Δoacc_ psqz <dig> with no obvious difference found between the oacb and oacc transformants in each host .

the ability of oacb and oacc to transform the deletion mutants of the heterologous serotypes was further confirmed by 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy, which showed that the o-polysaccharides of the transformants had acquired the 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii . the 1h and 13c nmr spectra of the o-polysaccharides of 51579Δoacc_ psqz <dig>  and 51579Δoacc_ psqz <dig> were essentially identical, and, hence, the o-polysaccharides had the same structure, including the same total degree of 3/4-o-acetylation . serotype 2a strain sf <dig>  its sf301Δoacb deletion mutant, and the sf301Δoacb_ psqz <dig> transformant has been characterized by us earlier, and the 1h and 13c nmr chemical shifts of their o-polysaccharides have been reported  <cit> . the 1h and 13c nmr spectra of the o-polysaccharide of sf301Δoacb_ psqz <dig> were similar to those of sf301Δoacb_ psqz <dig>  differing only in lower intensities in the former strain of the signals for the 3-o-acetyl and 4-o-acetyl groups at δh  <dig>  and  <dig> , δС  <dig>  and  <dig> , as well as for the o-acetylated forms of rhaiii: h-3/c- <dig> at δh/δС  <dig> / <dig>  and h-4/c- <dig> at δh/δС  <dig> / <dig> . a lower degree of o-acetylation in the sf301Δoacb mutant complemented with the heterologous oacc gene as compared with the homologous oacb gene  could be due to a poorer adaptation of oacc of serotype  <dig> for 3/4-o-acetylation of the serotype 2a o-polysaccharide having a different backbone structure.

gene oacc is carried by a bacteriophage structure on the chromosome
the dna regions flanking the oacc gene of partially sequenced serotype  <dig> strains cdc 796– <dig> and cch <dig> were analyzed, and the genomic structures are shown in figure  <dig>  in strain cdc 796– <dig>  the oacc gene was located at the 5′ end of contig nz_aero <dig> and immediately followed by  <dig> orfs encoding proteins of phage origin, with  <dig> of tail structure and assembly , two corresponding to head-tail adaptor/connector , one putative phage protein , and one related to head assembly  . this prophage structure is homologous to , and organized in a similar manner as, the structure region  of s. flexneri bacteriophage sfii genome  , indicating their close evolutionary relationship. in contrast, it showed no similarity to the oac-carrying bacteriophage sf <dig> and the oac1b-carrying phage-like structure, which are both responsible for the 2-o-acetylation on rhai in serotypes 1b, 3a, 3b, 4b, and 7b  <cit> , or to the transposon-like structure carrying oacb for 3/4-o-acetylation of rhaiii in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, and y  <cit> .figure  <dig>

to elucidate whether the oacc-carrying prophage structure occurs in all serotype  <dig> strains, we performed pcr screening on  <dig> serotype  <dig> strains using the oacc- <dig> primer pair , which covers the oacc gene and neighboring sgf_ <dig> genes. except for  <dig> strains, the expected product  could be amplified from all strains tested, and the pcr product sequences were identical to that of contig nz_aero <dig>  the oacc gene of strain cch <dig> was found to be located near the end of contig nz_akmw <dig> downstream of two insertion sequences . they followed a region of genes encoding putative adhesin and attaching/effacing protein  , a fragment of unknown function that was also present in the genomes of several e. coli strains . the same insertion sequence is <dig> also occurred immediately upstream of oacc in strain cdc 796– <dig> . furthermore, pcr amplification and sequencing performed on the  <dig> serotype  <dig> strains using the oacc- <dig> primer pair that covers sfcch060_ <dig>  and sfcch060_ <dig>  showed that all but  <dig> strains  tested were pcr positive. the four outliers also were negative when further pcr amplification was performed targeting on genes up to sfcch060_ <dig>  probably owing to dna fragment insertion or deletion events happened in this region. pcr screening using the oacc- <dig> primer pair indicated that the four strains carried the phage-like structure downstream of oacc, and, therefore, might acquire the 3/4-o-acetylation by the same phage mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, the oacc gene encoding a novel acyltransferase oacc was demonstrated to be responsible for the 3/4-o-acetylation on rhaiii in s. flexneri serotype  <dig>  this conclusion was supported by the following evidences: i) the oacc protein encoded by the oacc gene showed significant similarity to oacb and other acyltransferase family proteins; ii) deletion of the functional oacc gene resulted in the loss of the 3/4-o-acetylation in serotype 6; iii) the cloned oacc gene mediated the 3/4-o-acetylation of rhaiii upon transformation. the oacc gene is specific to serotype  <dig> and presented in all strains of this serotype tested; hence, this gene can be used as a target for molecular identification of s. flexneri serotype  <dig> 

although oacc occurs only in serotype  <dig> strains, it has the interchangeable function with oacb, which is responsible for 3/4-o-acetylation of rhaiii in non-6 s. flexneri serotypes, and conversely oacb can confer this modification to serotype  <dig>  this could be expected as oacc and oacb possess a high homology , and the o-polysaccharides of serotype  <dig> and the other s. flexneri serotypes share the → 2)-α-l-rhapiii--α-l-rhapii disaccharide fragment.

as opposite to the oacb gene localized in a transposon-like structure, the oacc gene is carried by a chromosomal phage-like structure adjacent to the adhesin region that is conserved in serotype  <dig>  therefore, the mechanisms of 3/4-o-acetylation in serotype  <dig> and the other serotypes  are distinct, which is not surprising as they have different evolutionary origins and belong to different lineages of shigella clones of e. coli  <cit> . accordingly, the divergent oacs might have been gained from different species in independent events. these findings enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of o-antigen modifications in s. flexneri.
