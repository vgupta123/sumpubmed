BACKGROUND
the production of recombinant proteins using mammalian cells is a large industry today, which accounts for billions of dollars annually for the production of biotherapeutic products  <cit> . chinese hamster ovary  cells have become the host of choice for recombinant protein production, due to their capacity for correct protein folding, assembly and posttranslational modification. moreover, cho cell lines have been well characterised, and they have a very well-known history of regulatory approval for recombinant protein production  <cit> . the cho-dhfr expression system is the most widely used for high-level expression of recombinant products in cho cell lines .

however, cho cells are known to have a very unstable karyotype, due to chromosome rearrangements that can arise from translocations and homologous recombination, especially when amplified with methotrexate hydrate   <cit> . in this context, unstable recombinant protein production has been observed in  <dig> to 63 % of all recombinant cho  cell lines using cho-dhfr/glutamine synthetase expression systems in the absence and presence of selection pressure  . when the cells are propagated in the absence of a selective agent, the amplified genes can be maintained or lost  <cit> . changes in the rcho cell populations after extended cultivation in the absence and presence of selective pressure have been reported  <cit> . fann and colleagues reported unstable recombinant protein production in rcho cell populations in the presence of mtx, but not to the same extent as when the selective pressure was absent  <cit> . previous microarray expression profiling studies have been focused mainly on improved mechanisms underlying high cell productivity . trummer and colleagues identified potential marker genes related to productivity and stress resistance  <cit> . some productivity oriented studies have included transcriptomics and/or proteomic studies .

in the present study, the transcriptome profiles of cho clones with stable and unstable recombinant protein production were investigated over a 10-week period. the main purpose of the present study was to identify marker genes that can predict stable recombinant protein production in early cell-line development.

RESULTS
one of the problems still associated with recombinant protein production using the standard approach of clone screening is, however, the large percentage of clones with unstable productivity of the recombinant protein, which limits rapid and efficient cell-line development. to identify early marker genes for stable recombinant protein production in clones, the transcriptome profiles of the stable and unstable cho cell clones over a 10-week period were investigated, with two sampling points in the beginning  and two sampling points at the end  of the study period.

clone productivity, recombinant gene expression, and copy number in the 10-week study
this study was performed on six transfected clones. all six of these clones were grown with mtx in the media before the stability study began, to enhance the productivity of the clones. at the beginning of the stability study, each of these six clones was split and further grown without and with mtx in the media. the ‘beginning’ refers to the beginning of the stability study. the sampling at weeks  <dig> and  <dig> contains data from the six clones , which resulted in  <dig> samples. similarly,  <dig> samples were collected in weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  and these are referred to as the ‘end’ samples .fig.  <dig> set-up of the experiment. the study was performed on six transfected clones. before the stability study began, all six of these clones were grown with mtx in the media to enhance the productivity of the clones. at the beginning of the study, all of the six clones were split and further grown without and with mtx in the media. ‘beginning’ refers to the beginning of the stability study  and contains data from the six clones grown without and with mtx in the media, giving  <dig> samples. similarly,  <dig> samples were collected in weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  and are referred to as the ‘end’ samples



to define the phenotypes of all six of these clones, we measured the productivity and recombinant gene copy numbers for all of the samples at each time point. thus, the productivity and recombinant gene copy numbers were calculated from the samples grown without mtx  and with mtx  in the media, from the “beginning” , giving  <dig> samples altogether and similarly at the end  of the stability study. two groups of samples were formed at the end of the study, as stable samples  and unstable samples . the relationship between the productivity and the recombinant gene copy number is shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> correlation between the productivity and recombinant gene copy numbers in the clones. the productivity and recombinant gene copy numbers of the clones are represented according to the ‘beginning’  and at the ‘end’  of the 10-week study, as indicated. at the beginning, when the clones were split for parallel growth without mtx in the media, there were no large differences in the productivity and copy numbers between the clones grown without and with mtx in the media. due to high biological similarity of several  samples at the “beginning”, some of the data are overlapping, and therefore not all  <dig> data points are visible



all of the six clones were cultivated in parallel without and with mtx, and therefore we could observe the influence of mtx on the stability of the recombinant protein production. all six of the clones cultivated with mtx in the media were identified as stable producing clones, while the initially high-producing clones cultivated without mtx in the media showed unstable recombinant protein production. the stable producing clones varied on average by 9 %  in their initial productivity over the period of 10 weeks. in contrast, the productivity in the unstable clones declined on average by 67 %  over the same period. the decline in recombinant gene copy numbers in the stable high-producing clones in the same period was 45 % , compared to a 61 % decline  in the unstable clones .

the unstable recombinant protein production of the cho-dhfr expression system used in this study over long-term cultivation without selection pressure is attributed to a decrease in the recombinant gene copies  <cit> . a relation between the decline of recombinant protein productivity and the decline of recombinant gene copy numbers over long-term cultivation was also observed in the present study . it is common for productivity to drop by up to 71 % when selection pressure is not present in the media, as described by chusainow  <cit> . it has been additionally reported that cell lines can lose productivity during cultivation in the absence of selective pressure via transcriptional silencing by methylation, with no loss in recombinant gene copies . promoter methylation is generally known to cause gene silencing, and has recently been shown to additional contribute to unstable recombinant protein production in cho cell lines expressing an igg  <cit> ; however, such effects were not prominent in the present study.

transcriptional analysis of the stable and unstable clones
altogether  <dig> samples  were collected and further analysed using a whole-genome dna microarray and rt-qpcr. the transcript profiles of the stable and unstable clones over their 10-week cultivation were analysed using a whole-genome dna microarray . by comparing the transcriptome profile of stable and unstable groups of clones,  <dig> differently expressed genes were identified . as the productivity results for all of the unstable clones were obtained when selection pressure was not present , we have compared these results with the effects of cultivating cells without or with mtx. in all,  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed between the group of clones cultivated without and with mtx in the media  and  <dig> genes were common to both analyses. the remaining  <dig> genes were specifically differentially expressed when comparing the stable and unstable clones, and were therefore the focus of our further study.

the expression profiles of the  <dig> top differentially expressed genes between the stable and unstable clones  was verified  using rt-qpcr. these genes were: fgfr <dig>  bx <dig> /hist1h3c, ac <dig> , e130203b <dig>  hdhfr, hist1h2bc, cspg <dig>  c1qtnq, foxp <dig>  mmp <dig>  vsnl <dig>  cu <dig> , egr <dig> and ptpre . among these genes, e130203b <dig>  bx <dig> /hist1h3c, ptpre, cspg <dig>  fgfr <dig> and vsnl <dig> were identified as not affected by the presence of mtx in the media. statistical analysis of the rt-qpcr data comparing the clones that showed stable and unstable recombinant production regardless of the sampling times confirmed differential expression for  <dig> out of these  <dig> genes  . the vsnl <dig> gene was the only gene that was not expressed differentially between the stable and unstable clones  after the rt-qpcr analysis. seven of the  <dig> genes tested were up-regulated , and six were down-regulated  . the greatest differences in gene expression among these genes specifically for the comparison between stable and unstable clones were observed for the bx <dig> /hist1h3c, ptpre and fgfr <dig> genes.fig.  <dig> box plot of the relative gene expression ratios for the stable  and unstable  clones. the relative gene expression ratios for fgfr <dig>  bx <dig> /hist1h3c, ac <dig> , hdhfr, hist1h2bc, mmp <dig>  cu <dig> , e130203b <dig>  cspg <dig>  c1qtnq, foxp <dig>  egr <dig> and ptpre  for the stable  and unstable  clones are shown. the relative expression values were normalised using the geometric mean of the reference genes actb/gapdh. the threshold for statistical significance between the relative expression ratios of the stable and unstable clones was set to p =  <dig>  . box plots for genes where such differences were observed are represented in dark grey, in contrast to the white boxplots for non-significant genes



potential marker genes that predict stable recombinant protein production in the early phases of cell-line development
the main purpose of the present study was to identify marker genes in the early phases of cell-line development that can be used to predict stable recombinant protein production. thus, we only used the data from the samples collected at the beginning of the study , without or with mtx in the media, to determine whether their expression profiles could be used to separate them into stable and unstable clones as determined at the end of the study . five genes  were selected for this analysis from among these  <dig> differentially expressed genes because the expression of these genes was shown not to be affected by the presence of mtx in the media and all five genes were differently expressed between stable and unstable samples. three out of the  <dig> samples used here did not pass our quality control criteria for reliable quantification by rt-qpcr for all of these five genes, and these were thus excluded from analysis. principal component analysis  of the expression of these five genes shows that more than 92 % of the total variability of the gene expression data can be explained by the first three principal components. when the first three principal components were presented in three-dimensional form , there was clear separation of the stable and unstable clones. the classification with the k-nearest neighbour algorithm also confirmed the separation of the two groups. for the beginning data , the optimal number of clusters is four where the unstable clones form a distinct cluster. even for a sub-optimal number of clusters , the unstable clones form a separate cluster, which suggests that unstable clones form a very compact and distinctive cluster. by observing the sample grouping in fig.  <dig>  it is evident that the data can be grouped into several clusters with the unstable clones as a separate cluster.fig.  <dig> three-dimensional representation based on principal component analysis. the properties of the clones are described according to the first three principal components  of the expression of the genes e130203b <dig>  bx <dig> /hist1h3c, ptpre, cspg <dig> and fgfr2




numerous approaches have been addressed to predict stable recombinant protein production in early cell-line development. for example, dorai and colleagues  <cit>  identified apoptosis as a possible cause of instability using a flow cytometry method for the identification of apoptotic cells in early cell-line development . barnes and colleagues  <cit>  indicated that the levels of recombinant mrna expression detected by northern blotting related to stable recombinant protein production at the beginning of long-term cell culture. a whole transcriptome marker identification approach as described in the present study has not been described previously.

putative functional correlations of potential marker genes with stable recombinant protein production
genes fgfr <dig> and egr <dig> of the identified potential markers of instability have functions related to cell growth , genes hdhfr, hist1h2bc and bx <dig> /hist1h3c are involved in dna replication and chromosomal stability . the following two genes cspg <dig> and protease mmp <dig> are important in cell migration and cell regulation . another group of potential marker genes  is involved in intracellular signaling . genes foxp <dig> and ac <dig>  are regulators of transcription  and c1qtnf <dig> is involved in regulation of gene expression . all  were already implied in relation to cancerogenesis showing the potential link of identified genes to instability of cellular processes in mammals. no functions for genes e130203b <dig> and cu <dig>  have been described to date.

CONCLUSIONS
the precise molecular mechanisms behind genetically unstable transgene expression are not fully understood. however, some gene expression properties between clones with stable and unstable recombinant production can be used to predict this instability. by combining the expression patterns of the e130203b <dig>  bx <dig> /hist1h3c, ptpre, cspg <dig> and fgfr <dig> genes using principal component analysis, clear separation of the stable and unstable clones can be achieved through observing just the first three most significant principal components. based on this analysis, the unstable clones in our setting can already be excluded in the early stage of such cell-line development. in this way, a lot of labour-intensive work, and in particular a lot of time, can be saved in the development of such cell lines. however, potential marker genes were identified for a limited number of clones, and thus this approach needs to be tested further to be fully implemented as a replacement for the standard methods of screening stability.
