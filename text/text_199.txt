BACKGROUND
the transforming growth factor-beta <dig>  signaling pathway is a fundamental pathway in the living cell, which plays a role in many central cellular processes. the tgf-β superfamily contains over  <dig> different proteins, such as bmps, activins, inhibins, and the tgf-β <dig> isoforms
 <cit> . the pathway contributes to regulation of various cellular processes, such as apoptosis, cell differentiation, cell growth as well as tumor suppression and immune regulation processes
 <cit> .

there are three tgf-β isoforms  which have different physiological and pathological effects on epithelial, endothelial, lymphatic, myeloid and mesenchymal tissues
 <cit> . the tgf-β pathway is one of the most studied pathways
 <cit> . however, the complex and sometimes contradicting mechanisms by which tgf-β yields phenotypic effects is not yet completely understood
 <cit> . the classical tgf-β <dig> pathway is already well established since several years
 <cit> . however, the identification of alternative signaling pathways that contain different receptors and smad proteins has increased the overall complexity of the tgf-β <dig> signaling pathway
 <cit> . additional file
1: figure s <dig> shows a simplified cartoon sketch comprising mainly smads cascades in the tgf-β <dig> signaling pathway.

in this study we investigated and compared downstream effects of tgf-β <dig> stimulation on the dynamical response of gene expression in mouse and human in different cell and tissue types. two types of mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells were used: multipotent progenitor  and dendritic cell  committed progenitors, referred to as common dendritic progenitor  cells. cdp differentiate from mpp and give rise to two types of dc: plasmacytoid dc  and conventional dc . mpp and cdp were obtained from bone marrow by in vitro culture with a specific cytokine cocktail and facs sorting
 <cit> . furthermore, we employed human mesenchymal stromal cells , which differentiate into osteocytes, chondrocytes or adipocytes
 <cit> . finally, primary murine hepatocytes  and immortalized human hepatocytes  cells were used. we have taken these different cell types for three reasons:  all these cells are highly responsive to tgf-β.  the different cell types reflect different degrees of differentiation.  the different cells show a variable response to tgf-β. while in hepatocytes tgf-β induces apoptosis, multipotent progenitors initiate a differentiation programme in response to tgf-β.

very little and vague information is known about the detailed influence of tgf-β <dig> in these different cell systems. for example, tgf-β <dig> is known to be necessary for msc proliferation. it is essential for chondrogenic differentiation. on the other hand, tgf-β <dig> participates in inhibition of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. furthermore, there are evidences, that tgf-β <dig> contributes to supporting myogenic differentiation of msc
 <cit> . there are also evidences that the tgf-β pathway play a role in the induction of cellular senescence in msc
 <cit> . although tgf-β <dig> triggers primary early responses  and emt in human hpc  cells, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are generally not promoted by tgf-β1
 <cit> . furthermore, tgf-β <dig> is known to be crucial for development of langerhans cells, the cutaneous contingent of migratory dendritic cells, both in vivo and in vitro and it evidently contributes in accelerating their differentiation and directing their subsets specification toward cdcs
 <cit> .

we used a panel of bioinformatics methods, ranging from statistical testing over functional and promoter sequence analysis to clustering for pattern discovery in our gene expression time series data. only one gene, the ski-like oncogene , was commonly found to be differentially expressed  in all cell types. skil is a component of the smad-pathway, which regulates cell growth and differentiation. moreover, smad <dig> that blocks tgf-β receptor activity seems to play a major common role, because it was identified as de in most cell types. despite of the differences on the level of individual genes we observed a conserved effect of tgf-β <dig> stimulation on a number of biological processes and pathways. moreover, we could identify a few overrepresented transcription factor binding sites, which were commonly found in several cell types. specifically egr <dig> seems to have major relevance for the transcriptional stimulation response in mouse and human.

by analysis of an independent dataset on human a <dig> lung adenocarcinoma cells  from geo 
 <cit>  we were able to reproduce a highly significant proportion of the commonly identified biological processes, pathways and transcriptional factors in our datasets. network analysis suggests explanations, how tgf-β <dig> stimulation could lead to the observed effects.

RESULTS
time series transcriptome measurements
all cell types were treated with tgf-β in three biological replicates. tgf-β treatment concentrations were optimized in each cell type to show a maximal effect. extracted rna samples were hybridized to microarrays  for genome-wide transcriptome analysis. mouse progenitor cells and hepg <dig> cells were measured at  <dig> successive time points, mouse primary hpc cells at  <dig>  and human mscs at  <dig> different time points. additional file

differential gene expression
transcriptional response is highly tissue specific on gene level
we employed the “betr” method
 <cit>  to quantify the probability of differential expression of genes in whole time-courses . using this approach we were able to assess differential gene expression for each gene in each cell type in a comparable manner. we considered a gene to have differential time-course expression , if it had a probability of >99% and was at least two-fold up- or down-regulated at one time point minimum .

the strongest stimulatory effect of tgf-β <dig> was observed in cdp cells . eight out of these genes in cdp are already known to play a role in the tgf-β pathway . in mouse hpc a significantly lower number of de genes were found compared to other cell types.

we conducted set comparisons of de genes across cell types. it is worth mentioning in this context that comparisons between mouse and human genes were done on the basis of homologous genes . not surprisingly, the found overlap was particularly high among mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells . these were  <dig> genes, which equals a harmonic mean of above 41% of de genes in both cell types . only two of these genes, namely smad <dig> and tgfbr <dig> are known to play a role in the tgf-β pathway. three genes  are found to be de in all mouse cells . pmepa <dig>  is known to interact with smad and suppress the tgf-β pathway
 <cit> . only the protein-coding gene skil  that encodes a protein in the smad-pathway
 <cit>  was found to have a de time-course in all cell types. in addition, the gene smad <dig> was commonly found in all cell types except mouse hpc cells.  <dig> genes including ror <dig>  c10orf <dig>  smad <dig>  fstl <dig>  gadd45b, junb, zfp <dig>  olfm <dig>  sptlc <dig>  id <dig>  lmcd <dig>  slc38a <dig>  gxylt <dig>  skil, hes <dig>  rasgef1b, cited <dig> and pdgfa were de in all human cells . the heatmaps in additional file
1: figure s <dig> visualize patterns of temporal behavior for particular groups of genes. here again we see similarity in gene expressions between mouse dendritic cells.

these findings on one hand stress the similarity of the transcriptional response in mpp and cdp, which is not very surprising given the fact that these cells were both derived from bone marrow. on the other hand they highlight that tgf-β <dig> treatment affects by far not only genes within the canonical tgf-β <dig> pathway, but leads to a large number of diverse secondary downstream effects, which are only partially overlapping across different cell types. in other words there is a high tissue specificity of the transcriptional tgf-β stimulation response on the level of individual genes.

tgf-β <dig> pathway genes react time-dependant and tissue-specific
we had a closer look at genes, which are known to play a role in the tgf-β <dig> pathway, such as bmp, smad and id. in figure 
 <dig> the log <dig> fold changes of  <dig> genes involved in the tgf-β <dig> pathway, which are de in at least one cell type, are depicted. it can be noticed that almost all genes show time-dependant transcriptional effects. these effects are distinct between early and later time points, with moderate activities until 4 h and mostly higher activities at late times. it can also be noticed that cells of similar origin are more alike. for example, bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  cdkn2b and comp are dys-regulated  only in human and not in mouse tissues. fs <dig> is similar to these genes, but also shows activity in mouse hpc. id <dig> in human cells is up-regulated at earlier time points and a down-regulated after 4 h. inhba shows activity only in msc cells where its expression after 1 hour constantly increases. smad <dig>  smad <dig> and smad <dig> reveal similar time courses in mouse mpp and cdp cells and in human mscs. smad <dig> is increasingly down-regulated over time and the other two genes are always up-regulated. smurf <dig> is always over-expressed and shows a curve that is opposite to smad <dig>  smad <dig> and smad <dig>  tgfb <dig> is over-expressed at later time points in mpp and cdp cells and shows almost no activity in the other cell types. thbs <dig> is highly active in all cell types. however, while it is underrepresented in mpp and cdp, it shows elevated expression in mouse and human hpc. tgfbr <dig> and tgfbr <dig> behave similar, in particular in mouse progenitor cells, where tgfbr <dig> is less up-regulated than tgfbr <dig> 

time point specific analysis confirms highly tissue specific expression changes on gene expression level
in order to cross-validate our previous analysis, which considers time series as a whole, we conducted also a time-point specific analysis of differential gene expression using linear models for microarray data . for this purpose we compared the gene expression at 4 hours after stimulation to the initial expression at time point  <dig>  the time period of 4 hours was chosen because at least short-time relevant effects are expected in all cell types after this period.

in the context of this time point specific analysis of transcriptional effects we considered a gene to be differentially expressed  in a given cell type, if fdrbh <  <dig>  and the absolute fold changes was  >  <dig>  the overlap analysis of de genes at 4 h agrees with the time-course analysis. there are no or very few genes in common between the different cell types except in the case of mouse dendritic cells . moreover, the direction of regulation  differs between cell types .

the heatmap in additional file
1: figure s <dig> depicts the log fold changes of all genes, which are de in at least one cell type. the plot indicates two gene sets, which clearly show a similar behavior in mouse mpp and cdp cell types. the first set contains  <dig> genes that are over-expressed. the other set  is under-expressed. interestingly, the  <dig> genes being up-regulated in mpp and cdp cells are not regulated by tgf-β <dig> in other cell types. although not de genes in every cell type, the genes smad <dig>  pmepa <dig>  seem to be up-regulated in all the cells. the rest of the genes are regulated in a rather cell-type specific manner.

cluster analysis reveals functionally similar gene groups in different cell types
we conducted a time series cluster analyses in order to find groups of de genes showing similar expression changes over time . the cluster analyses yielded  <dig> clusters in mpp and mouse hpc,  <dig> in cdp and  <dig> in human msc . genes contained in individual clusters can be found in additional file
2: table s <dig>  figure 
 <dig> depicts the mean curves for each of these clusters in each cell type. we investigated the functional similarity of genes across different clusters. for this purpose the r-package “gosemsim”
 <cit>  utilizing the semantic similarity measure proposed by wang et al.
 <cit>  was employed. semantic similarities are a means to compare go annotations of gene pairs in a quantitative manner, for example on the basis of the information content of go terms. we refer the reader to
 <cit>  for an excellent overview.

a heatmap depicting these go semantic similarities suggested a high functional similarity of genes in several clusters from different cell types . in particular cluster b , and cluster b  are highly similar to each other . time-course log <dig> fold changes of the corresponding genes are shown in . as can be noticed the clusters are of different size, but have several genes in common . functional analysis revealed that genes in these clusters are enriched for cell adhesion molecules , valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, pantothenate and coa biosynthesis and regulation of cellular extravasation. enrichment analysis was conducted here via the r-package gostats
 <cit> , which employs a hypergeometric test taking into account the dependency structure among go terms.

the second group of functionally similar clusters  contains cluster k  and cluster b . genes in these clusters play  a role in tgf-β and notch signaling pathways .

taken together our cluster analyses showed that despite evident differences on the level of individual genes, functionally similar clusters of genes can be identified across cell types.

enrichment analysis reveals commonly affected biological processes, pathways and transcription factors in all cell types
motivated by our previous findings we asked, whether there were common functional patterns across all cell types. for this purpose we scanned go terms and kegg pathways for significant association with differential time course gene expression in each cell type .

our analysis brought up  <dig> kegg pathways and  <dig> go terms, which were significantly associated to all cell types . the  <dig> kegg pathways associated to all cell types were: metabolic pathways, glutathione metabolism, lysosome, purine metabolism, peroxisome and ppar signaling pathway. the  <dig> go terms associated to all cells were: oxidation-reduction process, innate immune response, positive regulation of transcription from rna polymerase ii promoter, negative regulation of apoptotic process, angiogenesis, lipid metabolic process, positive regulation of cell proliferation, positive regulation of cell migration, proteolysis, positive regulation of transcription dna-dependent and response to drug. the role of tgf-β in apoptosis, cell proliferation as well as immune response is well known. moreover, an effect of tgf-β perturbation on ppar signaling has been described in skin fibroblasts
 <cit> . in
 <cit>  the authors describe tgf-β mediated oxidative stress and decreased glutathione concentration in fibrosis models. finally, there is evidence that tgf-β has an effect on angiogensis and cell migration
 <cit> . hence, our findings largely fit to the current biological knowledge about tgf-β.

conserved role of egr1/ <dig> transcription factors
we analyzed de genes with respect to overrepresented sequence motifs in their promoter regions with the xxmotif tool
 <cit> . significant motifs were then compared to known position weight matrices  of transcription factors  via stamp
 <cit> .

the analysis in each cell type predicted between  <dig> and  <dig> regulating tfbs in the time-course analysis , except for mouse hpc, where no overrepresented tfbs could be detected. this may be attributed to the small number of  <dig> de genes in this cell type. overlaps were particularly high within mouse mpp and cdp and within human cells.foxp <dig>  krox, tef, pou6f <dig>  fox and pitx binding sites were commonly identified in mouse mpp and cdp. krox, hfh <dig> and pax <dig> were found in all human cells. fox, foxp <dig>  krox and tef were found to be themselves representatives of de genes. figure 
 <dig> shows a network representation of all eight tfbs together with the set of de genes containing respective binding sites. the plot reveals a relative clear difference between mouse and human cells with the exception of the krox tfbs, which appears in all four cell types. krox represents egr <dig> and egr <dig> 

network analysis suggests possible signal transduction pathways in mouse and human
in order to better understand, how tgf-β may influence the commonly identified transcription factor, biological processes and the ppar-pathway we conducted a network analysis. using protein-protein interaction information from the biogrid database
 <cit>  we reconstructed a mouse and a human specific network depicting dys-regulated paths from tgf-β to skil, smad <dig>  egr <dig> as well as genes involved into glutathione metabolism, purine metabolism, ppar signaling, oxidation-reduction process, innate immune response, negative regulation of apoptotic process, angiogenesis, positive regulation of cell proliferation and positive regulation of cell migration .

our network analysis suggests pathways, by which tgf-β stimulation is possibly propagated via protein-protein interactions to our commonly identified biological processes. due to the organism specificity of interactome information these pathways show certain differences: far less protein-protein interactions are known in mouse than in human. in human, for example, negative regulation of apoptosis might be mediated via smad <dig> and sox9
 <cit> . in contrast, the go and network analysis in mouse suggests a direct role of tgfbr <dig> 

enrichment of biological processes, pathways and tfbss is reproducible on independent dataset
to validate the central finding from our data, namely the existence of commonly affected biological processes, pathways and transcription factors in all cell types, we downloaded an independent dataset comprising gene expression data measured at  <dig> time points  after tgf-β stimulation in human a <dig> lung adenocarcinoma cell-lines . the dataset was analyzed in the same manner as described for our data before. high fractions of the  <dig> go terms and  <dig> kegg pathways commonly identified in all of our cell types were also found in gse <dig> . out of the kegg pathways and go terms associated to all of our human cells 70% and 74%, respectively could be reproduced on the independent dataset . notably,  <dig>  out of the  <dig> genes which exhibiting differential time courses in both our human msc and hpc cells were found also to have differential time-courses in gse <dig> cells, these were ror <dig>  smad <dig>  fstl <dig>  gadd45b, junb, zfp <dig>  id <dig>  lmcd <dig>  gxylt <dig>  skil and hes <dig>  this corresponding fraction is significantly larger than expected by chance .

the krox tfbs , which was enriched in all of our cell types, was also found in gse <dig>  moreover, the other two tfbs that we identified in our human cells  were also enriched in the a <dig> lung cancer cell line .

taken together this analysis reveals a high reproducibility of our commonly identified biological processes, pathways as well as tfs.

CONCLUSIONS
we have conducted an in-depth comparison of the dynamical tgf-β <dig> response profile on gene expression level across several cell types. despite of a generally high degree of cell type specificity, there appears to be a common functional response, which is conserved across cell types and species . our analysis suggests a common effect of tgf-β <dig> stimulation on apoptosis, cell proliferation, immune response, angiogenesis, cell migration, ppar signaling, oxidative stress as well as purine and glutathione metabolism. network analysis gives hints to possible pathways, by which these effects could be mediated.

on the level of individual genes the ski-like oncogene and smad <dig> were differentially expressed in most  or all  cell types and thus appear to play a major role. smad <dig> is involved into the canonical tgf-β pathway
 <cit> . it is a general antagonist of the tgf-β family . the ski-like oncogene is a direct target gene of smad <dig>  which regulates its transcription
 <cit> . it plays a role in cell growth and differentiation.

notably, a high fraction of the biological processes, pathways and tfbs that we identified to be enriched in all our cell types was found also in an independent dataset from a lung cancer cell line. this strengthens the confidence into our results.

in summary our findings indicate that despite a high variability of transcriptional response across cell types and organisms there appears to be a set of commonly affected processes and pathways. in addition, the tfbs analysis suggested a major role of the transcription factor egr <dig> in the tgf-β response in human and mouse. indeed the induction of egr <dig> via tgf-β stimulation has been already reported earlier
 <cit>  and thus fits to the existing knowledge about tgf-β1 − induced transcriptional response in other cell systems.

previous studies of tgf-β stimulation were mainly limited to one specific cell type . in this paper we went beyond this point and conducted experiments in different cell types under as much as possible comparable conditions. in consequence we were able to compare transcriptional responses across cell types and organisms, which revealed common patterns. the identification of common and specific signal transduction pathways that are affected by tgf-β in human and mice will allow us to define potential therapeutic targets and will further enable us to characterize gene expression patterns and complex regulatory networks. in addition, future work using our and other transcriptome data can, for example, address the identification of tgf-β dependent mesenchymal or epithelial gene signatures or the definition of cell specific cancer signatures.
