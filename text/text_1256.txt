BACKGROUND
plants are frequently threatened by drought that affects growth and development, productivity and quality  <cit> . therefore, improvement of drought tolerance has been the subject of intense studies via either traditional breeding or biotechnology-mediated approach. as a first step towards improvement of drought tolerance via genetic engineering in plant, genes with functions in drought tolerance should be cloned and characterized. it has been established that plants respond and adapt to drought stress through modifying transcriptional levels of a large number of genes  <cit> . these genes can be generally classified into two main groups based on their products, effector molecules or regulator molecules, which are also correspondingly designated as delayed-response genes or early-response genes based on their response timing  <cit> . products of the former group function directly in protecting cells against damage derived from stresses and sustaining cell viability, and the latter is composed of regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors , protein kinases and protein phosphatases, that are responsible for transducing stress signaling and regulating expression of stress-responsive genes  <cit> .

tf constitutes the key regulon that plays crucial roles in various biological processes, including stress response, through binding to the cis-acting element in the promoters of target genes  <cit> . aba-responsive element , an important cis-element, is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of aba- and/or stress-responsive genes  <cit> . in plants, abre binding factors /abre binding proteins  are basic region/leucine zipper  class tfs  <cit>  that interact with abre. abf/areb family tfs have been cloned and characterized in arabidopsis thaliana and other plants  <cit> . in the arabidopsis genome, nine abf/areb homologues have been identified so far  <cit> . up-regulation of abf/areb family members by various abiotic stresses, such as drought, high salinity, cold, anoxia, and by aba in different plants suggests that they are involved in aba and/or stress signaling  <cit> .

tfs are known as master switch in plant stress response, and genetic transformation of the genes encoding tfs has been suggested as a possible approach for engineering stress tolerance as manipulation of a single tf can alter expression of a wide array of target genes  <cit> . genetic transformation of abf/areb has been shown to render stress tolerance. for example, constitutive overexpression of areb1/abf <dig>  abf <dig> or abf <dig> in arabidopsis resulted in enhanced drought tolerance  <cit> . in another work, interestingly, overexpression of abf <dig> in arabidopsis was found to promote tolerance to drought, high salt, heat and oxidative stresses  <cit> . later, abf/areb family members have been transformed into lettuce and agrostis mongolica, and the transgenic plants were more tolerant to drought and cold/heat stresses than wild type  <cit> . all of these successful examples indicate that genetic manipulation of abf/areb family members can be of significance for modifying plant stress response  <cit> .

although abf/areb members have been comprehensively studied in the model plants, information concerning their counterparts in woody plants is relatively lacking. trifoliate orange  raf), an important rootstock for citrus, is drought intolerant, which has restricted its use in regions with water deficit. a raised question is whether or not the abf homologue in trifoliate orange can function in stress tolerance. on the other hand, it was noticed that limited information is available concerning physiological and/or molecular basis on enhanced stress tolerance in the transgenic plants overexpressing an abf gene in previous reports. therefore, we tired to clone an abf gene from trifoliate orange, and functionally characterize its role in dehydration/drought tolerance. in addition, accumulation of reactive oxygen species  and expression of stress-responsive genes in the transgenic plants were illustrated.

RESULTS
cloning and bioinformatics analysis of ptrabf
eighteen sequences were found in the search of the citrus est database, which were successfully combined into a contig. rt-pcr using the gene specific primers  designed based on the contig gave rise to a single band. sequencing and bioinformatics analysis showed that the cdna,  <dig> bp in length, contained a 1347-bp open reading frame , along with a 35-bp 5' untranslated region  and a 129-bp 3' utr. the cdna, designated as ptrabf , encodes a predicted polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig> kda and a pi of  <dig> . this gene has been deposited in ncbi under the accession number of hm <dig>  multiple alignments between ptrabf and eight other abf proteins revealed high sequence identity among each other . at the c-terminus of ptrabf there was a bzip signature  composed of a 25-amino acid basic region and a leucine zipper containing three leucine repeats  that were spaced from each other by seven amino acids. the proteins had four highly conserved regions, three at the n-terminus  and one at the end of c-terminus . the phylogenetic tree constructed based on amino acid sequences of ptrabf and abfs from other  <dig> representative plants showed that ptrabf was most closely related to its counterpart of grape, while it is most distant to rice .

expression pattern of ptrabf under various treatments
in plants, an important feature of abfs is the induction of expression by various abiotic stresses. in order to know if ptrabf acts in the similar way, expression profiles of ptrabf under different treatment  were assessed via qrt-pcr. the transcript level of ptrabf began to accumulate  <dig> h after dehydration, and increased progressively until the end of treatment, which was more than  <dig> folds of the initial level . steady-state mrna of ptrabf began to accumulate  <dig> h after low temperature treatment, and continued to increase until it reached the highest level at  <dig> d . when subjected to salt treatment, the transcript of ptrabf did not change notably except a slight decrease at  <dig> h and  <dig> d , indicating that ptrabf was not salt-inducible. in the case of aba treatment, mrna abundance was first reduced at  <dig> d, resumed to the basal level during the next two days, and increased at  <dig> d and maintained thereafter .

ptrabf was localized in the nucleus
sequence analysis showed that there was a nuclear localization signal  in the basic region of the bzip dna binding domain, implying that ptrabf may be localized in the nucleus. in order to verify this, subcellular localization of ptrabf was examined by monitoring the gfp fluorescence in the onion epidermis cells transformed with either the fusion construct  or the control . when onion cells were transformed with gfp plasmid, green fluorescence signals were observed in the entire cell region . in contrast, fluorescence was exclusively detected in the nucleus of cells transformed with the fusion plasmid , implying that ptrabf is a nuclear protein.

ptrabf had transactivation activity and could bind to abre
transactivation activity is another defining feature for a transcription factor in addition to nuclear localization. to identify if ptrabf functions as a transcriptional activator the yeast two-hybrid analysis was used. for this purpose, the full-length ptrabf coding region was fused to the dna-binding domain of gal <dig> to generate a fusion plasmid, which was transformed into yeast and growth of the cells was compared with those transformed with the control plasmid  on the same medium. yeast cells carrying either the control plasmid or the fusion plasmid grew well on sd/-leu/-trp medium, indicating that the analysis system was reliable. on the sd/-ade/-his/-leu/-trp medium, the cells transformed with the control plasmid could not grow, whereas those transformed with the fusion plasmid grew normally. the yeast cells transformed with the fusion plasmid could also live on the medium added with 3-at, but the growth was repressed in a concentration-dependent manner . in addition, when the yeast cells were cultured on the sd/-ade/-his/-leu/-trp medium added with both  <dig> mm 3-at and  <dig> mm x-Î±-gal, only those transformed with the fusion plasmid turned blue . all of these results indicated that ptrabf had transactivation activity in yeast.

previous work showed that abf can bind to the cis-element abre  <cit> . in order to investigate whether ptrabf has the same dna-binding activity, the full length orf of ptrabf was fused to the gal <dig> activation domain of vector pgadt <dig> and the fused construct  was co-transformed with phis-abre construct containing triple tandem repeats of abre into yeast strain y <dig> . although all of the yeast cells with different constructs could grow on sd/leu-/trp-/his medium without 3-at, only the cells co-transformed with pgadt7-ptrabf and phis-abre grew normally in the presence of 3-at, while the growth of transformants containing constructs lacking either ptrabf or abre was completely inhibited , suggesting that ptrabf could bind to the abre and activate the reporter gene in yeast.

overexpression of ptrabf enhances tolerance to dehydration and drought
to investigate the function of ptrabf, agrobacterium-mediated transformation of tobacco leaf discs was carried out using a binary vector containing ptrabf under the control of 35s promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . totally,  <dig> t <dig> lines were characterized by pcr with primers specific to camv 35s and ptrabf and nptii, and  <dig> out of them were confirmed as putative transgenic lines, and overexpression of ptrabf in two lines  was verified by semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis . these two lines and wild type  were subjected to dehydration and drought treatment to investigate the role of ptrabf in water stress response. no morphological difference was noted between the transgenic lines and wt . when the aerial parts of 5-week-old in vitro seedlings were dehydrated, fresh water loss was increased in the two transgenic lines and wt with the progressing of dehydration. however, significantly higher water loss was observed in wt than the two transgenic lines from  <dig> min onwards . although # <dig> lost less water than # <dig>  the difference was not statistically significant except at  <dig> and  <dig> min after dehydration. electrolyte leakage of # <dig> was equal to that of # <dig>  both of which were significantly smaller than wt . when dehydration was completed, leaves of wt exhibited more serious wilting relative to the transgenic lines .

apart from dehydration, long-term water stress  tolerance of the potted plants was also examined by water withholding. morphological difference became apparent after watering was stopped for  <dig> d, when wt lost its turgor while # <dig> and # <dig> grew better . when the drought was extended to as long as  <dig> weeks, phonotypical difference was more dramatic between wt and the transgenic plants, as manifested by presence of more dead leaves in the former . electrolyte leakage of # <dig>  and # <dig>  was significantly lower in comparison with  <dig> % of wile type , whereas total chlorophyll of the transgenic lines  was significantly higher than wt . the above results showed that the two transgenic lines were more tolerant to short-term dehydration shock or long-term water stress .

accumulation of o2- and h2o <dig> in the transgenic lines and wt under drought
as the transgenic lines were more tolerant to dehydration and drought than wild type, attempts were made to compare accumulation of h2o <dig> and o2-, two main reactive oxygen species , in their leaves sampled at the end of water stress. for this purpose, leaves of the transgenic lines and wild type that have been either dehydrated for  <dig> min or exposed to drought for  <dig> d were stained with dab or nbt to reveal in situ accumulation of h2o <dig> and o2-, respectively. histochemically staining showed that before dehydration, h2o <dig> and o2- could also be stained, and the transgenic lines had slightly lower ros levels relative to wt. dehydration resulted in notable increased of ros levels in both wild type and the two transgenic lines, whereas wt accumulated remarkably more o2- and h2o <dig> than both # <dig> and # <dig>  as less blue  or brown  products were observed in the latter two. similarly, under drought the two transgenic lines accumulated dramatically less o2- and h2o <dig> than wt , implying that less ros was produced in the transgenic lines under the stressful conditions.

analysis of activity of antioxidant enzymes and expression levels of the encoding genes in transgenic lines and wt before and after drought
the above-mentioned results demonstrated that the two transgenic lines produced less ros compared with wt when they were simultaneously stressed. as ros-scavenging enzymes play critical role in detoxifying ros activities of three key enzymes, superoxide , catalase  and peroxidase , were measured in the two transgenic lines and wt before and  <dig> d after drought. before water stress, activities of the three enzymes were higher than those of the control, but the difference was not prominent. water stress caused decrease of sod activity, which was significantly lower in wt than in # <dig> and # <dig> . exposure to drought resulted in slight rise of pod activity in wt, which was notably enhanced in the two transgenic lines. as a result, pod activity of # <dig> and # <dig> was  <dig>  and  <dig> folds of that in wt, respectively . activity of cat was augmented in all of the tested samples, while the transgenic lines had significantly higher activities than wt . all of these showed that activities of the three detoxifying enzyme were higher in the transgenic lines than wt, in reverse proportion to the ros accumulation of these lines. examination of the genes encoding sod, cat and apx showed that before water stress the expression levels of the three genes were higher in the transgenic lines than in wt. exposure to drought led to induction of these genes in both wt and the transgenic plants, whereas the transcript levels were still higher in the latter except ntapx in # <dig> 

expression analysis of stress-responsive genes before and after drought
semi-quantitative rt-pcr was used to assess expression levels of nine stress-responsive genes in both wt and the transgenic lines under normal conditions and after 7-d water stress . in the absence of water stress, transcript levels of ntadc <dig>  ntadc <dig>  ntsamdc, ntlea <dig>  nterd10c, ntcdpk <dig> and ntdreb were obviously enhanced in the two transgenic lines compared with those of wt, whereas those of ntareb and nterf underwent minor change. drought stress caused upregulation of all nine genes in wt and the transgenic plants. however, it is noticeable that steady state mrna levels of the genes in the two transgenic lines were still higher than wt, particularly ntadc <dig>  ntlea <dig>  nterd10c and ntdreb. these data indicated that overexpression of ptrabf in tobacco led to change in the transcript levels of endogenous stress-related genes.

discussion
it has been well documented that upon exposure to abiotic stresses transcript levels of a multitude of genes are altered. numerous studies have shown that abfs/arebs play significant roles in regulating these stress-related genes via interaction with abre cis-element in their promoters, suggesting that abfs/arebs are tightly involved in plant response to various adverse environment conditions. in this work, a gene encoding abf from p. trifoliata was isolated by rt-pcr in combination with bioinformatics approach based on ests deposited in the public database. sequence multiple alignment demonstrated that ptrabf showed high degree of sequence identity with abfs of other plants retrieved from the database at amino acid level. a highly conserved bzip domain consisting of a basic region responsible for dna binding and three heptad leucine repeats related to tf dimerization  <cit>  was observed near the c-terminus of ptrabf, indicating that ptrabf encoded a bzip family protein. apart from the bzip domain, it also contained four highly conserved regions at the n or c-terminus . within these regions, several serine  and threonine  residues or consensus sequences are present, consistent with the structure of abfs from other plants  <cit> . these conserved residues have been suggested as phosphorylation sites of different kinases, such as calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii  and casein kinase ii , cgmp-dependent protein kinase , implying that activation of ptrabf might be regulated by protein phosphorylation, as has been reported in other arebs/abfs  <cit> . presence of these common characteristics demonstrated that ptrabf cloned in our study shared striking sequence similarity with other abfs and may have a biological function same as or similar to them in abiotic stress response. the phylogenetic tree revealed relationship between ptrabf and abfs from other plants, in which ptrabf was closely related to abfs from dicots, including the abfs of arabidopsis thaliana. although most abfs in the tree remain to be characterized, in planta functions of abfs of arabidopsis have been determined, in which abf <dig> and abf <dig> act as activators of aba/stress response. in addition, overexpression of abf <dig>  abf <dig> has been shown to affect multiple stress tolerance, implying that ptrabf might function in the same way as abfs of arabidopsis.

an important feature of plant abfs is the induction of their transcript levels by abiotic stresses  <cit> . qrt-pcr analysis demonstrated that steady state mrna levels of ptrabf were induced by aba, dehydration and low temperature. expression patterns of ptrabf were largely similar to abf4/areb <dig> that has been shown to be induced by aba, salt, cold and drought  <cit> . however, it has to be mentioned that ptrabf was not induced by salt, different from abf <dig>  in arabiopsis it has been shown that although abfs were all induced by aba, they are differentially regulated by various stresses and have been suggested to play various roles in stress response  <cit> . abf family members might have specificity in their role under different stresses apart from existence of function redundancy, in which abf <dig> and abf <dig> played essential roles in germination control and aba/stress response, whereas abf <dig> was more closely implicated in seedling growth regulation and glucose response  <cit> . induction of ptrabf by both dehydration and low temperature seems to indicate that this gene may participate in response to these cues.

compared with low temperature, dehydration caused more profound induction of ptrabf mrna abundance, which compelled us to do in-depth work on elucidation of the potential role of this gene for enhancing dehydration and drought tolerance. to this end, transgenic tobacco plants were produced via agrobacterium-mediated transformation of ptrabf under the control of camv 35s promoter. the two selected transgenic lines exhibited better phenotypic morphology, concomitant with less water loss, lower electrolyte leakage and higher chlorophyll content than wild type under either dehydration or long-term water stress, suggesting that overexpression of ptrabf conspicuously conferred tolerance to these adverse conditions. apart from the water stress used herein, the transgenic plants also exhibited enhanced tolerance to low temperature treatment in comparison with wt . our work agreed with earlier reports, in which overexpression of abf family members has been shown to render tolerance to multiple stresses in the same transgenic line  <cit> , implying that abfs class transcription factors hold great potential for genetically manipulating stress tolerance.

despite the fact transformation of abf genes led to improvement of abiotic stress tolerance, the physiological mechanism underling the tolerance remained largely unknown. this stimulated us to carry out more work to find out physiological difference between the transgenic plants and wt under stress. we put special emphasis on comparing their ros levels because it has been well accepted that in biological systems ros accumulation is related to physiological perturbation and ros levels can reflect the degree of damage to cellular components  <cit> . histochemical staining by dab and nbt clearly demonstrated that under dehydration and drought conditions the two transgenic lines accumulated remarkably less o2- and h2o <dig> than wt. as ros level during stresses greatly relies on the homeostasis between generation and removal  <cit> , accumulation of less ros in the transgenic lines seems to indicate that scavenging systems in these plants might work more effectively compared with wt. in order to detoxify stress-induced ros, plants evolve a complex antioxidant system, in which several enzymes play essential roles, leading to scavenging ros and protecting the cells against oxidative stress  <cit> . of the enzymes, sod provides the first line of defense against ros by catalyzing the dismutation of o2- to oxygen and h2o <dig>  which was then scavenged by coordinated action of cat and pod  <cit> . in our study, activities of sod, pod and cat in the two transgenic lines were not profoundly different from those of wild type under well-watering conditions although they were slightly higher in the transgenic lines, which sounds reasonable because under normal conditions ros production remained at low levels and oxidative stress was not serious  <cit> . however, under water stress, activities of the three enzymes were significantly higher in the transgenic plants than wt, implying that the transgenic plants had more robust detoxifying system to eliminate ros produced during stress, which is consistent with the dramatic reduction of ros level and ros-associated membrane damage . it is noticed that activation of antioxidant enzymes was consistent with the upregulation of the three genes, suggesting that these enzymes may be regulated at transcriptional levels. induction of genes involved in ros scavenging has been previously reported when tf was ectopically expressed  <cit> , suggesting that the tf might transcriptionally regulate the expression of genes related to oxidative reactions. our work suggested that deployment of a better ros-scavenging system might be an integral part of defense against drought in the transgenic plants expressing ptrabf.

to cope with unfavorable environmental constraints plants modulate the expression of a large spectrum of stress-responsive genes, constituting an important molecular basis for the response and adaptation of plants to stresses  <cit> . in order to understand regulatory function of ptrabf and to explain the enhanced drought tolerance at molecular levels, transcript levels of nine stress-responsive genes were monitored before and after drought treatment, including five genes encoding functional proteins  and four encoding regulatory proteins , which or whose homologues in other plants have been shown to be involved in abiotic stress response. rt-pcr analysis showed that steady-state mrna levels of these genes were higher in the transgenic plants compared with those of wt in the absence of water stress, in line with earlier reports in which overexpression of a tf resulted in extensive alteration of transcript levels of an arsenal of related genes  <cit> . although expression levels of all of the tested genes were upregulated by drought, they were still higher in the transgenic plants than in wt, indicating that these genes were more intensely induced in the transgenic lines. ntadc <dig>  ntadc <dig> and ntsamdc are genes involved in biosynthesis of polyamines, which are low-molecular-weight polycations and have been shown to be important stress molecules  <cit> . polyamines function in stress adaptation by acting as osmoticum regulator or membrane stabilizer through binding to macromolecules like proteins, nucleic acids and phospholipids of plasma membrane  <cit> . more drastic induction of these genes implied that the transgenic plants might synthesize higher levels of polyamines to prevent them from lethal injury and maintain better growth under water stress  <cit> . on the other hand, polyamines have been also proposed to act as free radical scavengers  <cit> , and the larger induction of the polyamine biosynthetic genes agreed with lower ros accumulation in the transgenic plants after drought stress. ntlea <dig> and nterd10c encode hydrophilic late embryogenesis abundant  proteins that are assumed to play critical roles in combating cellular dehydration  <cit> . higher expression levels of these genes suggested that the transgenic plants might provide more chaperones for various substrates and maintain membrane integrity or efficiently bind water, which are important strategies for plants to sustain growth during drought  <cit> . induction of these functional genes to higher levels suggested that the transgenic plants might synthesize more protective compounds  or proteins , which, along with others that were not identified herein, provided better adaptive or defensive niches against water stress, leading to alleviation of cellular damage when they were subjected to drought. upregulation of the above genes suggests that they might be transcriptionally regulated by ptrabf through binding of the cis-element abre in their promoter. although we could not provide evidence for this speculation, abre has been discovered in the promoter of most genes encoding lea proteins  <cit>  and in atadc <dig> and atsamdc <dig> of arabidopsis  <cit> . in addition to the functional genes, it is noted that the ntcdpk <dig> and ntdreb were also induced to higher levels in the transgenic lines with or without drought stress, while nterf and ntareb were only slightly induced upon water stress. induction of their mrna to higher levels raised the possibility of interaction between them and ptrabf in order to orchestrate well-defined stress tolerance machinery that functions in protection of the plants against adverse environment. interestingly, the expression patterns of ntcdpk <dig> and ntdreb were largely consistent with those of the functional genes before and after water stress. ntcdpk <dig> and ntdreb are important regulatory molecules involved in signal transduction or transcriptional regulation during stress conditions  <cit> . these genes may act as the intermediates between ptrabf and the aforementioned functional genes. in this case, ptrabf might function to facilitate transcriptional upregulation of these endogenous regulatory genes, which in turn activated their downstream target genes, including those mentioned above. in the future, extra work is needed to decipher the connection between these genes so as to gain more insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ptrabf function in water stress tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
a class-a bzip transcription factor encoding ptrabf has been successfully isolated from p. trifoliata, which was induced by dehydration, low temperature and aba. ptrabf was confirmed as a transcription factor due to subcellular localization in the nucleus, presence of transactivation activity and binding with abre.

overexpression of ptrabf in tobacco enhanced tolerance to dehydration shock and long term water stress . the tolerance may be ascribed to more robust activation of ros scavenging system and coordinated and timely activation of an array of stress-responsive genes at molecular level, leading to synthesis of a wide range of protective compounds and proteins. these strategies may act in cooperation to render a more protective line of defence against the water stress.

the results presented here demonstrate that overexpression of ptrabf significantly modified drought tolerance in the transgenic plants, indicating that ptrabf might be a candidate gene with potential application to enhance abiotic stress tolerance.
