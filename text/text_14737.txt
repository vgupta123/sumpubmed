BACKGROUND
the pig  is one of the most important livestock animals due to its economic importance in the alimentary industry, but it is also an interesting biomedical model for human diseases  <cit> . over the last few decades, genetic selection in commercial pig breeds has greatly improved meat-production efficiency at the expense of reducing the sensorial and technological properties of the meat. these changes are mainly caused by the reduction in intramuscular fat  content and alterations in fatty acid  composition, both critical for various meat quality attributes such as muscle color, firmness, water-holding capacity and also important nutritional aspects  <cit> . in this regard, fa composition of food has also become a critical aspect in human nutrition: a high consumption of sfa has been associated with obesity, high plasma cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases  <cit> , while replacing sfa with mufa or pufa decreases serum ldl cholesterol and total cholesterol, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease  <cit> .

factors other than dietary intake have been less characterized in relation with tissue lipid composition. these include the role of candidate-gene genotypes in lipid and fa metabolism  <cit> . in this context, studies in pigs can have a dual purpose: first, to study the genetics of food, i.e., how the genotype of the animal influences the fa content and profile of meat and, secondly, as an animal model for nutrigenomic studies or for human metabolic diseases.

the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle are the principal organs involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. the adipose tissue is an organ which is responsible for energy storage in the form of lipids and, in pigs, is the major source of circulating free fas   <cit> . it also acts as a major endocrine organ, producing adipocytokines like tnfα, peptide hormones such as leptin, adiponectin, estrogen and resistin and lipid hormones  such as palmitoleate, all of which are involved in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis  <cit> . furthermore, pig adipose tissue has a greater contribution to overall fa synthesis than does the liver  <cit> . thus, the characterization of the transcriptome landscape of this organ may be relevant for the improvement of pork nutritional quality.

the development of next-generation sequencing  methods has provided new tools for both transcriptome characterization and gene-expression profiling. the rna-seq technique is based on sequencing the poly-a rna fraction and allows for characterizing isoforms from known genes or discovering novel, predicted coding genes  <cit> . to-date, the number of rna-seq analyses in livestock is still scarce, some recent reports have focused on the study of organs  <cit> , animal products such as milk  <cit>  or embryos  <cit> . thus, in  <dig>  esteve-codina et al. compared the pig gonads of two individuals from two breeds . the same year, chen et al.  analyzed the transcriptome of three pig tissues  in two full-sib f <dig> females with extreme phenotypes in growth and fatness . furthermore, a liver rna-seq study was performed using four animals from genetically different porcine breeds   <cit> .

in a previous work of our group, the livers of ten iberian × landrace backcrossed pigs classified in two phenotypically-extreme groups for intramuscular fa composition , were analyzed using rna-seq  <cit> . this study identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed in the liver that may play a crucial role in muscle lipid composition. nevertheless, muscle lipids are derived not only from the liver , but also from adipose tissue   <cit> . therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the contribution of backfat transcriptome to the fa content and profile of intramuscular fat in pigs. the two main goals of our study are:  the identification of genes and pathways differentially expressed in the backfat of iberian × landrace crossbred pigs  showing extreme phenotypes for intramuscular fa composition, and  to describe transposable elements and new putative protein-coding genes in the transcriptome of pig backfat. combining the new adipose tissue transcriptome data with the already available liver transcriptome information will allow us to study the expression of genes regulating the overall lipid metabolism in pigs.

RESULTS
phenotypic variations between extreme groups
in a previous work by our group, animals from an iberian × landrace backcross  were analyzed with a principal component analysis  to describe the phenotypic variation of traits related to carcass quality and intramuscular fa composition  <cit> . the score information of the first principal component in pca was used to classify the bc1_ld animals into two groups high  and low  and the hepatic transcriptome from the most extreme females  was evaluated using an rna-seq approach  <cit> . in the present study, a total of six females  were selected for rna sequencing of their backfat tissue. pedigree information was used to avoid the selection of sibs in the same group. when phenotypic means between groups were compared, 50% of the traits showed significant statistical differences  . in summary, the h group showed higher levels of intramuscular polyunsaturated fatty acids , and group l showed higher levels of saturated fatty acids  and monounsaturated fatty acids  . the lack of statistical significance of palmitoleic  and heptadecenoic  acids content, in comparison with ramayo-caldas et al. , may be explained by the lower sample size. results obtained are in agreement with the breed effect on backfat fa composition, showing similarities between l-group animals and iberian pigs, which had higher percentages of c16: <dig> and mufa  and a lower content of pufa than did commercial breeds  <cit> . meanwhile, animals of the h group had higher percentages of pufa, as observed in landrace animals  <cit> . most importantly, the two groups of pigs did not differ in either imf content or backfat thickness. this is relevant, as the two groups include pigs with similar abilities to deposit fat in muscle and backfat, but they incorporate fa with different elongation and desaturation indexes.

characterization of pig adipose tissue transcriptome
sequencing yielded around 236 m of 75-bp paired-end reads and approximately 84% of reads were mapped against the reference pig genome assembly sscrofa <dig>  using tophat software. percentages of mapped reads observed per individual ranged from 80% to 87%, and were equally distributed in the h and l groups. these values were higher than were the percentages reported in previous porcine transcriptome studies:  <dig> %- <dig> %  <cit> ,  <dig> %- <dig> %  <cit> ,  <dig> %  <cit>  and 54%  <cit> . the intersectbed tool from bedtools was employed to calculate the proportion of mapped reads annotated in exons, introns and intergenic regions. the highest percentages of reads were mapped to exons , while 19%-20% fell in intergenic regions, and the lowest percentages were located in introns  . the proportion of reads mapped to exons was slightly higher than were the values reported by ramayo-caldas et al.  and chen et al. , due likely to the better pig genome assembly  and annotation version employed in our work. nevertheless, the current gene annotation still needs to be improved in order to determine the function of approximately 20% of reads, which mapped in intergenic regions. finally, transcripts generated from assembling the short reads by cufflinks fell mostly into annotated exons . the remaining reads were classified into the following categories: intron retention events , intergenic transcripts , potentially novel isoforms of genes , pre-mrna molecules  and polymerase run-on fragments  . the percentage of intergenic transcripts represented the third category in read abundance, which is relevant for detecting putative coding transcripts or new transposable elements not described in the current version of the pig genome.

exploring for novel coding transcripts and transposable elements in the adipose tissue transcriptome
transcript annotation performed with cufflinks showed a mean value of  <dig>  total unknown intergenic transcripts . this value doubles the number of intergenic transcripts detected in previous studies  <cit> . to determine which of these transcripts encoded a protein, augustus software  <cit>  was used and, as was expected, the total amount of predicted proteins was also higher, as compared to previous studies:  <dig>  predicted proteins against  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit> . our analysis showed an improvement in the sequence length and sequence coverage. furthermore, the conservative approach used in  <cit> , in which only those transcripts expressed in at least four of the five animals of each group were considered, could aid to explain the differences obtained . blastp analysis was performed to compare the putative proteins predicted by augustus against the predicted proteins reported by ramayo-caldas et al.  in the liver and esteve-codina et al.  in gonads. a total of  <dig> new putative proteins fitted in with those previously described:  <dig> putative proteins were expressed in liver transcriptome  and  <dig> were expressed in gonad transcriptome . additionally, a functional annotation was performed using blast2go software. blastp analysis of the  <dig>  predicted proteins revealed that  <dig>  proteins  displayed significant similarity with existing protein sequences . these proteins corresponded to:  <dig> novel computationally predicted proteins and  <dig>  known human proteins,  <dig> novel and  <dig> known bovine proteins and  <dig> novel and  <dig> known porcine proteins. hence, the number of novel predicted proteins was lower in better-described genomes . from the  <dig>  predicted proteins, only  <dig>  were functionally annotated with at least one gene ontology  term. at the third go level, the most represented biological terms were ‘primary metabolic process’ , ‘cellular metabolic process’  and ‘regulation of biological process’ . according to the molecular function, ‘protein binding’ , ‘ion binding’  and ‘nucleic acid binding’  were the most represented categories. in the cellular compartments category, ‘cell part’  was the most represented term, followed by ‘membrane-bounded organelle’  and ‘organelle part’  . furthermore, the main metabolic pathways represented were purine metabolism , pyrimidine metabolism , phosphatidylinositol signaling system  and inositol phosphate metabolism ; these and other pathways observed are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

repetitive elements  were identified in the adipose tissue transcriptome using the repeatmasker software. the total interspersed repeats represented 36% of the intergenic transcripts , a percentage higher than those observed in previous porcine transcriptome analyses:  <dig> %- <dig> %  <cit>  and  <dig> %  <cit> . as described above, the differences obtained could be explained by the assembly used for each analysis. the description of these regions has been improved in the current assembly , as demonstrated in the results observed. the major part of the re were classified as sines , representing  <dig> % of the transcriptome sequenced. the second group was lines , but these re constitute a larger part of the transcriptome than do sines due to the bigger size of lines . the remaining re were classified as: ltr elements , dna elements  and unclassified re .

gene expression analysis
counting the reads mapped in each gene, around  <dig>  annotated genes were expressed in adipose tissue with similar amounts between groups . taking into account only those genes with a minimum mean of  <dig> reads per gene in at least one of the extreme groups,  <dig>  expressed genes were selected. gene-expression distribution was similar in both groups, classifying 1% of the selected genes between 0– <dig> mapped reads; 27%-28% among 20– <dig> mapped reads; most genes  had between 200– <dig>  mapped reads; 23% among  <dig> - <dig>  mapped reads, and the remaining genes  more than  <dig>  mapped reads . mean gene-expression levels were highly correlated between groups , indicating that most genes were similarly expressed in both groups. five of the six individuals were also assayed with the gene-chip® porcine microarray  to analyze the gene expression of  <dig>  sus scrofa genes. after signal normalization, correlation between the expression data obtained by microarrays and rna-seq was calculated. all animals showed a high spearman correlation   in accordance with previous studies of the porcine transcriptome  <cit> , confirming the reproducibility of the data. genes with intermediate expression values had a higher correlation between technologies than did genes with low or high expression values. this same pattern had already been observed in previous studies, and it is explained by the higher dynamic range of rna-seq analyses  <cit> . finally, the top  <dig> expressed genes showed an over-representation in biological gene ontologies related to hormone-sensitive lipase-mediated triacylglycerol hydrolysis, lipid digestion, mobilization and transport, pyruvate metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fas. additionally, key regulatory pathways were also detected: the ppar signaling pathway, which is important for the induction of pre-adipocyte differentiation and fa storage  <cit> , or the chrebp transcription factor, which has emerged as a major mediator of glucose action on lipogenic gene expression and as a key regulator of lipid synthesis  <cit> .

differential gene expression among animals with extreme phenotypes of intramuscular fa composition
biological functions over-represented in the differentially expressed genes are candidate functions to explain the variation in intramuscular fa composition among the analyzed animals. gene-expression data from each group was compared using deseq software, which allowed for the detection of differentially expressed genes between groups. the data were filtered, discarding those genes with a mean of less than  <dig> reads mapped in one of the extreme groups. finally, a total of  <dig>  genes were used to perform the differential expression analysis using a standard cut-off of: |fold difference| ≥  <dig> , a p-value ≤  <dig>  and a q-value ≤  <dig>  . deseq software identified a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes , from which  <dig> were up-regulated in the l group and the remaining  <dig> genes were down-regulated in the same group . it is noteworthy that nine of the differentially expressed genes in adipose tissue  have been previously reported as being located in genomics regions associated with the profile of intramuscular fa composition in a gwas study in the same animal population   <cit> . therefore, these genes should be considered as interesting candidate genes for pig meat quality traits. nevertheless, future studies are needed to determine the causative effect of each gene, due to rna-seq analyses not allowing us to distinguish the causal genes from those genes that are consequently altered by the gene expression of other genes or by phenotypic differences.

to gain insight into the metabolic processes that differed between both groups, the list of  <dig> differentially expressed genes was analyzed using the core analysis function included in ingenuity pathways analysis . the main biological functions identified were related to cancer, lipid concentration, synthesis of lipids, homeostasis of blood, and fa metabolism . interestingly, within the general representation of lipid metabolism, de novo fa synthesis pathway is remarkable where the most relevant genes showed lower expression in the h group. the atp citrate lyase   is the primary enzyme responsible for the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-coa from citrate and coa in many tissues   <cit> . although citrate is the main substrate for iniciating de novo lipogenesis in pigs, acetic acid is also used to produce cytosolic acetyl-coa in species with extensive forestomach and hindgut fermentation such as rabbits, cattle, sheep and goats. the gene responsible for acetic acid conversion is the acyl-coa synthetase short-chain family member  <dig>  , which was also less expressed in the h group, suggesting that cytosolic acetate may also contribute to increase lipogenesis in pig adipose tissue . both genes provide the substrate necessary for acetyl-coa carboxylase alpha  to iniciate de novo fa synthesis. the acaca gene  encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa  <cit>  . this gene was previously reported as a candidate gene for a porcine quantitative trait locus  affecting the percentages of palmitoleic, stearic and vaccenic acids in chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the product of acaca is catalyzed by the fatty acid synthase  gene  to synthesize palmitate  in the presence of nadph  <cit>  . these steps are important for the conversion of intermediate metabolites into fas, thus contributing to the synthesis of cellular lipids and storage of fats. the lower expression levels of these genes may explain the minor content of c16: <dig> observed in l-group animals. the c16: <dig> fa produced in the cytosol is transferred to endoplasmic reticulum  membranes, where the elovl fatty acid elongase  <dig>  gene  and stearoyl-coa desaturase  gene  are sequentially involved to produce c18: <dig>  <cit>  . some studies performed in our group proposed the elovl <dig> gene as a candidate gene explaining a qtl in porcine chromosome  <dig>  related to c16: <dig> and c16:1n- <dig> in the same animal material  <cit> . despite no differences being observed between h and l groups of animals in backfat thickness  and imf content, down-regulation of this gene has recently been associated with a higher fat content  <cit> . moreover, the lower expression, in the h group, of genes related to glucose metabolism, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  or malic enzyme  <dig> , whose functions in glucose metabolism contribute to the initial steps of lipogenesis, is worth noting. the porcine g6pd gene  product is a cytosolic enzyme responsible for the first step of a chemical pathway that converts glucose to ribose-5-phosphate. on the other hand, the porcine me <dig> gene  encodes a tetrameric nadp-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of l-malate to pyruvate  <cit> . this gene was previously reported as a candidate gene for a porcine qtl affecting fat deposition in chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . both genes contribute to produce pyruvate, which is transported and metabolized in the mitochondria to produce citrate. this citrate is the substrate of the differentially expressed acly gene and the initial molecule of pig lipogenesis. this complete metabolic pathway, from glucose metabolism to de novo lipogenesis, is well represented in the first ipa-generated network identified as “lipid metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry”   . in clear consistency with the generated networks, the most representative canonical pathway significantly modulated between groups was the lxr/rxr activation  , which regulates the whole de novo fa synthesis pathway . other canonical pathways differentially modulated between groups were ethanol degradation ii, noradrenaline and adrenaline degradation, acute phase response signaling and the super-pathway of serine and glycine biosynthesis i . on the other hand, the lower representation of de novo fa synthesis observed in the h group was validated by the higher expression of the thyroid hormone responsive  gene . this gene is abundantly expressed in lipogenic tissues and plays an important role in the biosynthesis of triglycerides with a medium-length fa chain and in modulating lipogenesis  <cit> . the co-expression of this gene with mid <dig> interacting protein  <dig>  leads to form a heterodimer between these proteins, which in turn inhibits the mid1ip <dig> function of up-regulating the acaca enzyme  <cit>  . all together, these results show that the main difference observed between the two groups of animals is the differential expression of genes implicated in de novo fa synthesis pathway. results obtained may be explained by the adaptation of iberian breeds  to sparse food availability, whereas landrace pigs  are more sensitive to such variations due to this breed has been selected for fast growth. in support of our results, several key genes involved in glucose metabolism and de novo fa synthesis had been previously reported as differentially expressed between pigs with a lean phenotype  and pigs with an obese phenotype  in adipose tissue  <cit> . hence, differences in rates of tissue lipid accumulation between leaner pigs, as compared to fatter pigs, are attributable to genetic factors resulting in different patterns of expression of anabolic and oxidative lipid metabolism genes.

differentially modulated pathways and pig lipid metabolism
previous studies suggested that differences in fa composition between iberian and landrace pigs may be an indirect consequence of differences in de novo lipid synthesis  <cit> . in this sense, animals of the h group will produce a lower proportion of sfa and mufa, which must cause a decrease on triacylglycerides synthesis and the storage pathway. however, none of these pathways showed a down-representation in animals from the h group. additionally, a lower lipid production in h-group animals would affect the imf and bft long-term, but no significant differences were observed between animals of the h and l groups. an alternative model for explaining this difference in imf fa composition was previously suggested by  <cit> , considering that the higher content of pufa  in h-group animals may be caused by a greater absorption, transport, storage or a lower degradation of essential fas. consequently, this higher amount of pufa inhibits lipogenic activity in animals of the h group . this hypothesis would be a plausible explanation of the differences in fa accumulation observed between groups in adipose tissue and muscle, despite all animals having been fed the same diet.

ffas derived from adipose tissue and vldl-associated triglycerides derived from the liver are important sources of the fa supply to muscle, playing an important role in determining the intramuscular fa composition  <cit> . in fact, high, positive phenotypic correlations between adipose tissue and muscle fa composition were found for c14: <dig> , c16: <dig>  and c17: <dig> , and moderate, positive phenotypic correlations were found for c16: <dig> n- <dig> , c16: <dig> n- <dig> , c18: <dig>  and c18: <dig> n- <dig>  in our animal material , submitted). in a previous study  <cit>  that analyzed the liver transcriptome in the same groups of animals, it was suggested that a higher pufa content observed in the h group induced a greater stimulation of both peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation and reduced triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis. this increase of fa oxidation observed in the liver of animals of the h group, jointly with ketone body production, is a “glucose sparing” mechanism of regulation in fasting conditions  <cit>  which the animals were in at slaughter. in adipose tissue, the fasting condition induces the lipolysis of triglycerides storage and the blood transport of ffas bound to albumin   to organs such as the heart and skeletal muscle to fulfill their energy requirements  <cit> . previous studies performed in 3t3-l <dig> pre-adipocytes demonstrated that over-expression of alb stimulates long-chain fas uptake by direct interaction with adipose cells and suggested that this stimulatory effect may be a general phenomenon in other types of cells  <cit> . hence, data obtained may explain the greater uptake of fas into hepatocytes and their degradation in the β-oxidation pathway in the liver of the h-group animals. the negative effect that dietary pufa causes on de novo fa synthesis  <cit>  is well known, and this effect was also observed in our data. the down-regulation of this pathway in the group with the higher content of pufa  may be caused by the inhibitory effect of n- <dig> and n- <dig> pufa on the expression of receptor subfamily  <dig>  group h, member  <dig>   <cit> . the nr1h <dig> gene, also called liver x receptor α , is a nuclear receptor which is highly expressed in adipose tissue. studies performed in nr1h <dig> mice showed a decrease on de novo fa synthesis, due to the down-regulation of srebf <dig> and its target genes  <cit>  . other studies confirmed that chrebp is a key transcriptional regulator for the coordinated inhibition of glycolytic and lipogenic genes by pufa  <cit> . pufa also suppresses the chrebp gene function in a lxr-dependent manner, increasing its mrna decay and altering chrebp protein translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus  <cit> . in addition, we cannot rule out a direct inhibition of scd expression by pufa  <cit>  in animals of the h group. the repression of scd increases the intracellular pool of saturated fatty acyl-coas inhibiting the acaca enzyme and de novo lipogenesis and activating the carnitine palmitoyltransferase  <dig>  gene, which is responsible for the rate-limiting step in the importing and oxidation of fas into the mitochondria  <cit> . thus, altogether, our results are in agreement with a functional and anatomical separation of de novo lipid synthesis and β-oxidation in the porcine adipose tissue and liver, respectively. this suggests a tightly coordinated process among different hormones , transcription factors and nuclear receptors to avoid the simultaneous activation of antagonistic pathways. however, there is great controversy in explaining the relevance of β-oxidation in porcine adipose tissue. ppara is considered to be the main transcription factor controlling fa oxidation. there are some studies that described a greater expression of pig ppara in adipose tissue than in the liver, suggesting that adipose tissue could oxidize fas to any extent  <cit> . in contrast, other authors did not find ppara expression in porcine adipose tissues  <cit> . consistent with this, we found higher levels of ppara expression in the liver, as compared to adipose tissue, which suggests an important role of the liver in porcine β-oxidation.

different studies have determined the importance of several adipose tissue-derived hormones in the regulation of systemic carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis  <cit> . communication between adipose tissue and distant organs has been previously described through the lipokine palmitoleate , which strongly stimulates muscle insulin action while it suppresses hepatosteatosis  <cit> . studies performed in vivo in humans showed a clear increase of srebf1c caused by insulin in muscle and, consequently, the induction of key lipogenic enzymes  <cit> . the mean comparison of c16: <dig> n- <dig> fa composition between the l and h groups showed suggestive differences in both muscle  and adipose tissue . hence, different levels of c16: <dig> n- <dig> may determine a differential systemic regulation that may explain the phenotypic variations observed between groups. lipogenesis in muscle is produced by the small proportion of adipocytes in this tissue. therefore, their lipogenic activity is lower in comparison with other extra-muscular adipose tissues  <cit> . despite the lower rate of lipogenesis observed in muscle, de novo fa synthesis directly contributes to the in situ intramuscular fa composition  <cit> . in this sense, the study of muscle transcriptome in pigs, together with liver and adipose tissue transcriptomes, would be important in order to obtain a complete view of fa metabolism.

finally, other adipose tissue-derived hormones such as leptin or adiponectin cannot be discarded, as well as other interesting genes not annotated in the current pig genome assembly. the differentially expressed genes identified seem to be relevant in controlling the overall fa composition in adipose tissue and muscle, and they should be considered as candidate genes for meat quality traits in pigs. the knowledge of these genes and their regulatory networks may help in the design of new strategies for improving pork meat quality by increasing the mufa/sfa and n-3/n- <dig> pufa ratios  <cit> . the maintenance of these ratios is essential in order to reduce the imbalanced fa intake of today’s consumers and to avoid several diseases, including cancers and coronary heart disease. the great similarities between pigs and humans in body size and other physiological/anatomical features convert the pig into an excellent biomedical model for human disease. hence, analysis of the porcine backfat transcriptome showed the role of several genes in regulating the lipid metabolism not only in pigs but also in humans, due to the metabolic similarities between both species. additionally, several lipid-related diseases affected both human and pig , therefore, data generated in this study can be used to identify polymorphism with a major effect on these diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we provide a global view of the adipose tissue  transcriptome of six pigs and extensive new knowledge about transposable elements, new putative protein-coding genes and the expression levels of known genes in adipose tissue. animals were classified into two groups according to their intramuscular fa composition, and  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed between groups. these genes belong to molecular functions and gene networks related to lipid and fa metabolism. pathway analysis showed a different modulation of lipogenesis between phenotypically extreme animals, probably caused by differences in pufa levels . finally, the crucial role of imf fa composition in the technological and the nutritional and organoleptic quality of pork meat is well-known. hence, this study will allow for the identification of candidate genes and gene networks for fa composition traits which may help in the design of better selection strategies to improve porcine meat quality traits.
