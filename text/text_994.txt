BACKGROUND
topoisomerase i  is an enzyme which catalyses the relaxation of super coiled dna by cleaving and re-joining one dna strand  <cit> . topi activity is essential in dividing cells to release the torsion created by the progression of dna replication forks. camptothecin  is a plant alkaloid that specifically binds to topi, stabilizing the complexes formed between dna and topi  <cit> . the collisions between the trapped topi-cpt complexes and the replication fork during dna replication produce dna breaks, which induce dna damage responses and, depending on the dose, cell death  <cit> . cpt-induced dna damage responses have also been observed in plants  <cit> . for example, cpt induces dna damage in maize immature embryos and induces the transcription of genes involved in dna repair, the repression of genes involved in cell division, the accumulation of several proteins involved in stress responses and the induction of the activity of some nucleases  <cit> . nuclease activation in response to dna damaging agents has been previously observed  <cit> .

eukaryotic nucleases are involved in several processes like dna restriction, repair, recombination, transposition and programmed cell death   <cit> . plant nucleases can be classified into groups depending on their catalytic properties, mainly their divalent metal ion requirements. plants have two major classes of endonucleases, zn2+-dependent and ca2+-dependent endonucleases  <cit>  and refereed articles. some other subgroups have been identified whose nucleolytic activities are stimulated by other ions such as mg2+ <cit> , mn2+ <cit>  or co2+ <cit> .

zn2+-dependent nucleases  includes acidic and neutral enzymes with a molecular mass between  <dig> and 45 kda and that efficiently degrade rna and denatured dna, but not double stranded dna. a number of zn2+-dependent nucleases have been described in plants as, for example, the mung bean nuclease  <cit> , zen <dig> from zinnia elegans involved in tracheary element differentiation  <cit> , arabidopsis bfn <dig>  <cit>  and endo <dig>  <cit> , and others  <cit> . ca2+-dependent nucleases include neutral enzymes  <cit> . for example, arabidopsis ca2+-dependent can nuclease  <cit> , eucommia ulmoides oliv. eucan <dig> and eucan <dig> ca2+-dependent nucleases involved in the secondary xylem development  <cit> , and cucumber ca2+-dependent nuclease cscan involved, among other possible functions, in the primordial anther-specific dna damage of developing female cucumber flowers  <cit> .

determination of the catalytic requirements of a nuclease is essential for understanding its biological function. in normal conditions, plant cell nucleus and cytoplasm have a neutral ph  and low concentrations of ca2+ and zn2+, and the apoplast and vacuoles have a more acidic ph   <cit> . vacuoles usually have a higher concentration of zn2+, and apoplast a higher concentration of ca2+ than the cytoplasm. however, this situation can change in response to different stimulus. for example, during pcd the tonoplast rupture produces a higher concentration of zn2+ in the cytosol which also becomes more acid  <cit> . it has also been reported that some stresses rise cytosolic concentration of calcium due to an increase in the ca2+ influx from apoplasts  <cit> . these changes may alter the activity of particular nucleases.

in this paper, we identify and characterize a ca2+/mg2+-dependent nuclease whose activity is induced by cpt in maize cultured cells. we incubated maize cells with cpt and we observed an increase in a ca2+-dependent nuclease activity similar to what it was previously observed in maize cpt-treated embryos  <cit> . this nuclease has a mass of 32 kda, is activated by ca2+ and mg2+, and inhibited by zn2+ and edta. it cleaves either single- and double-stranded dna, with a higher activity against single-stranded dna and is mainly localized in the nucleus. two-dimensional in-gel assays and maldi-tof ms approaches following in-gel tryptic digestion allowed us to identify the protein responsible of the nuclease activity, which belongs to the s1/p <dig> type i endonuclease family.

RESULTS
induction of growth arrest and dna fragmentation by camptothecin in maize cultured cells
the topoisomerase i inhibitor camptothecin  produces a reduction of maize cultured cell growth when added to the culture medium . a concentration of  <dig>  μm cpt reduces the increase in fresh weight of callus to 58% compared to control and 50 μm cpt produces a reduction in 94% of the increase in fresh weight. growth inhibition is persistent, so the differences in the growth of fresh weight increased with time .

a nuclear-localized ca2+/mg2+-dependent endonucleolytic activity induced by cpt in cultured cells
the average size of the genomic dna fragments extracted from cpt-treated maize cultured cells are significantly shorter than the extracted from untreated cells . these differences are especially evident in cells treated with 50 μm cpt, but are also apparent in the case of cells treated with  <dig>  μm cpt.

the nucleases present in the cultured cells were analyzed by in-gel dnase activity assays in the presence of ca2+ and mg2+ . an endonuclease activity with a molecular mass of 32 kda was detected in protein extracts of treated and untreated cells, but the activity level was positively correlated with the concentration of cpt in the media. a second nuclease activity with an estimated molecular mass of 49 kda was also observed, although its activity was much lower and did not change in response to cpt.

in order to determine the catalytic requirements of the 32 kda cpt-induced nuclease we used in-gel nuclease assays under different incubation conditions . we analyzed the influence on nuclease activity of three divalent metal ions: zn2+, ca2+ and mg2+. zn2+ and ca2+ are the most common metal ion cofactors of plant nucleases and much less is known about the role of mg2+ on nuclease activity. the 32 kda nuclease activity is only slightly present in the presence of ca2+ or in the presence of mg2+, although in both cases is higher in the cpt-treated samples compared to the control. however, a very much higher activity was obtained when the gels were incubated in the presence of both, ca2+ and mg2+, showing an increased activity in cpt-treated cells. the ca2+ and mg2+-dependent nucleolytic activity was strongly inhibited by 1 mm edta and, although not completely, by zn2+, at least in our conditions. this finding confirms the common observation that plant ca2+-dependent nuclease activity can be inhibited by zn2+ <cit> . due to the mass and cationic preferences, we called this nuclease camnuc <dig> .

ph is another important factor determining nuclease activity. the majority of the plant nucleases have the highest activity at acidic or at neutral ph  <cit> . we compared the intensity of the 32 kda nuclease activity in the presence of ca2+ and mg2+ incubated at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  . although the activity was also observed at ph  <dig> , it was much lower than at ph  <dig> . in both cases, the activity was higher in the samples extracted from cpt-treated cells.

plant nucleases show divergent specificities towards their substrates, so, we analyzed the nucleolytic activity using single-stranded and double-stranded dna. the 32 kda nuclease is able to hydrolyze both single and double stranded dna, but shows higher activity against single stranded molecules . the higher affinity for single stranded dna did not change in samples treated or not with cpt.

camnuc <dig> subcellular localization and isoforms
in order to determine the subcellular localization of camnuc <dig> we performed cellular fragmentation experiments. nuclease activities were analyzed in cytoplasm and nucleus extracts . nuclear fraction purity was checked by immunological detection of a nuclear localized protein  and a cytoplasmic localized protein . at least four nuclease activity bands were observed in these assays. the previously observed  approximately 49 kda nuclease activity which is not induced in cpt-treated samples was only present in the cytoplasm. the nucleolytic activity of camnuc <dig> was mostly, but not exclusively, localized in the nuclear fraction, localization that did not change in the cpt-treated samples.

two bands of nuclease activity were observed in these in-gel assays with a molecular weight very close to camnuc <dig> . both nuclease activities are observed in the nuclear samples, and the intensities of both bands are higher in the cpt-treated samples. the similar behavior against cpt, the similar subcellular localization and the similar size suggested that they are different isoforms of the same nuclease, although we cannot also discard the possibility that they correspond to different nucleases. in order to clarify this point, we attempted 2d-in gel nuclease activity assays. first, we examined if camnuc <dig> activity was conserved in the conditions used for 2d gels. the presence of the alkylating agent iodoacetamide  strongly inhibits camnuc <dig> nuclease activity, whereas the reducing agent dithiothreitol  reduces its activity only slightly . subsequently, the 2d experiments were carried out using a standard protocol but omitting the second strip equilibration step that uses iaa. when total extracts were subjected to 2d gel analysis, the camnuc <dig> activity was divided in four main spots with minor differences in molecular weight but showing different isoelectric properties  . cpt produces the increase in the intensity of all four spots, besides an additional activity located around pi  <dig> , but did not produce a significant change in the isoelectric properties of camnuc <dig>  the pattern of distribution of the nuclease activities suggests that camnuc <dig> protein suffers post-translational modifications, but we cannot rule that they correspond to different nucleases with similar mass and different pi.

camnuc <dig> is a type i endonuclease of the s1/p <dig> family
to address the identification of the protein responsible of camnuc <dig> nuclease activity, nuclear protein extracts of maize cells treated with cpt were subjected to 2-de followed by nuclease activity assay. as previously, four activities were detected with similar mass and different pi . the three spots with higher activity were excised . we took only the lower part of the spots in order to avoid the presence of the detected nuclease activity with a slightly higher molecular weight than camnuc <dig> . after excision of the spots, in-gel trypsin digestion, maldi-tof-ms of the tryptic peptides and database searching only h <dig> spot provided positive data. the digestion of the h <dig> spot contained one peptide , which matches to a maize pa <dig> nuclease , with a mascot score of  <dig> and a protein coverage of 4%. even though the maize genome survey reveals four putative loci coding for pa <dig> nucleases, the protein sequence alignment reflects that the tryptic peptide sequence exclusively matches with the maize protein code by gene loc <dig> . interestingly, the predicted mass and pi of this protein is very similar to the observed for h <dig> spot:  <dig>  versus  <dig>  kda, and  <dig>  versus  <dig>  pi . the phylogenetic analysis of plant s1-nucleases indicates that three main groups are differentiated in vascular plants, represented by zen1/atendo <dig>  zen2/atendo <dig> and zen3/atendo <dig>  whilst camncu <dig> locates into a specific group composed by only cereal nucleases, clearly different from group- <dig> and group- <dig> . thus, maize possesses clear orthologs to group  <dig>  represented by atendo1/zen <dig>  and group  <dig> corresponding to atendo2/zen <dig>  <cit> . due to the low statistical support as well as that any cereal contains clear orthologs into group  <dig> , this particular cluster of nucleases is likely to be the group  <dig> in cereals.

discussion
the aim of this study was to identify possible nucleases associated with the camptothecin inhibition of cell growth in maize cultured cells. our results revealed the existence of at least one nuclease whose activity is induced in parallel to cpt treatment. our in gel nuclease assays demonstrated that the activity of a 32 kda nuclease increases during cpt treatment. this activity is higher in neutral compared to acidic ph and is higher in the presence of both ca2+ and mg2+, whereas is reduced in the presence of the single ions. the activity is inhibited by edta and reduced by zn2+. higher nucleolytic activity was observed against ssdna, although it is also active towards dsdna. the nuclease activity is mainly, although not exclusively, located in the nucleus.

bidimensional pattern of nuclease activity exhibited by camnuc <dig> suggests that this protein is subjected to post-translational modifications as it has been reported for some ca2+-dependent nucleases  <cit> , although we cannot discard that different nucleases with similar activity, size and pi exist. heterologous expression of s1-nucleases in prokaryote systems demonstrated that post-translational events are essential for their activity  <cit> . glycosylation is a good candidate to be responsible for the post-translational changes since the s1-nucleases and ca2+-dependent dnases are considered to be glycoproteins  <cit> . nevertheless, other post-translational processes might be considered  <cit> .

ca2+/mg2+-dependent nucleases with similar properties have been previously described in different systems. for example, rice oscyt <dig> is a ca2+/mg2+-dependent nuclease that shows a higher activity at neutral ph and is inhibited by zn2+ <cit> . ca2+/mg2+-dependent nuclease has also been identified in wheat grain nucellar cells undergoing pcd and is inhibited by zn2+ <cit> . a similar nuclease of 28 kda was observed in calf thymus chromatin  <cit> . arabidopsis can <dig> and can <dig> nucleases are neutral, ca2+-dependent nucleases showing a different specificity toward the ssdna, dsdna and rna substrates  <cit> . however, the identity of the majority ca2+/mg2+-dependent nucleases remains uncertain  <cit> .

our 2-de nuclease activity assay associated with spot excision and maldi-tof ms following in-gel tryptic digestion suggested that camnuc <dig> is a member of the s1/p <dig> family of type i endonucleases. although the results provide a very limited sequence coverage , the fact that the identified protein is a putative nuclease with a predicted molecular mass and a pi very similar to the observed ones provides enough confidence in the results. type i s1/p1-nucleases exhibit amino acid sequence homology with nuclease s <dig> from aspergillus oryzae and are classically defined by requiring zn2+ for activation and structure stabilization, to have a ph optimum in the acidic region, to have between  <dig> and 43 kda, and to be able to degrade single-stranded dna  <cit>  although some of them have the capacity to digest both single-stranded and double-stranded dna  <cit> . our results revealed that some s1-type nucleases are ca2+/mg2+dependent nucleases with neutral ph optimum. in fact, this is not the first report on a similar case. for example, the s1-like nuclease cel <dig> isolated from celery was reported as a zn2+- and mg2+-dependent enzyme  <cit> , and, recently, it has been shown that the s1-like family of nucleases in arabidopsis, in addition to zn2+-dependent enzymes, it also comprises nucleases activated by ca2+ and mn2+ and that they differ in their optimum ph value and substrate specificity  <cit> . altogether, these results reveal that plant s1-like nucleases have a surprisingly wide variety of enzyme activities. it also demonstrates that the biochemical classification of the plant nucleases does not perfectly fit their phylogenetic classification. type i s1/p1-nuclease cannot be considered anymore as synonymous of zn2+-dependent nuclease. the discovery of a wide variety of ions activating or inhibiting plant s1-like nucleases opens new perspectives for future research into reaction mechanisms catalyzed by these enzymes. s1-like family seems to evolve towards increasing the diversity of their catalytic properties. in fungi s <dig> and p <dig> nucleases play a role in the degradation of the extracellular dna and rna  <cit> , whereas in plants, most of the data suggest a relationship between s1-like nucleases and pcd. further analyses are necessary to demonstrate that camnuc <dig> is involved in pcd. the correlation of its activity with dna degradation suggests this function. its mainly nuclear localization is also compatible with a role in pcd, although it is also compatible with other functions like dna repair or recombination. camnuc <dig> activity, although at a lower extend, can be also observed in the cytoplasm, but this is not inconsistent with a pcd function. for example, the bfn <dig> nuclease is located in cytoplasmatic structures in early-senescent leaf cells and, as the tissue senesced, bfn <dig> is observed more abundantly around the nuclei  <cit> . on the other hand, we also observed camnuc <dig> activity in untreated cells that may be, in principle, contradictory with a pcd function. we cannot discard that some of the cells in the culture are suffering a senescence-like process. on the other hand, nuclease activities have also been detected in tissues where pcd does not occur as, for example, in arabidopsis mature stems which show low levels of bfn <dig> activity  <cit> . further analyses will be necessary to unequivocally associate camnuc <dig> with pcd.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a 32 kda nuclease, that we called camnuc <dig>  whose activity is induced by the topoisomerase i inhibitor camptothecin in maize cultured cells. the activity of this nuclease is ca2+/mg2+-dependent and is inhibited by zn2+ and edta. it cleaves either single- and double-stranded dna. maldi-tof ms following in-gel tryptic digestion suggests that camnuc <dig> belongs to the s1/p <dig> type i endonuclease family.
