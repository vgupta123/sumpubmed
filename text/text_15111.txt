BACKGROUND
despite their large size and complex multicellular structure, schistosomes display a remarkable ability to survive for years within the mammalian bloodstream, remaining viable and reproductively active in the face of potentially damaging immune responses. mechanisms proposed to account for the ability of schistosomes to evade immune destruction include, for example, molecular "camouflage", achieved by adsorption of host molecules to the parasite surface; molecular "mimicry", through expressing antigens with amino acid sequences that are similar or identical to host proteins; continuous surface membrane turn-over; and modulation of immune responses so that potentially harmful effector mechanisms are downregulated or inhibited  <cit> .

while schistosomes mostly evade immune injury during natural infection, acquired immunity to schistosome worms that interferes with infection can be demonstrated under some circumstances, both in naturally exposed human subjects  <cit>  and laboratory animal models of vaccine-induced immunity  <cit> . although the precise mechanisms by which protection is mediated under these different circumstances are debated  <cit> , there is consensus that protective immunity is dependent on cd4+ t cell responses  <cit> . intriguingly, there is also evidence that schistosoma blood flukes exploit cd4+ t cell responses, by co-opting the activities of cd4+ t cells during pre-patent infection to promote parasite development and subsequent reproduction  <cit> . the mechanisms by which cd4+ t cells facilitate schistosome development have yet to be fully elucidated, but these findings suggest that extensive co-evolution has resulted in a host-parasite relationship where schistosomes induce cd4+ t cell responses that are conducive to establishment of infection, while simultaneously avoiding immune injury. an understanding of the cd4+ t cell responses induced by schistosome worms during pre-patent infection is therefore a prerequisite to elucidating how these parasites evade immune injury and establish productive infections.

unlike the response to schistosome eggs  <cit> , the cd4+ t cell responses induced by schistosome worms, especially during normal permissive infection, have not been extensively characterized. schistosome eggs are potent inducers of th <dig> responses  <cit> , and some of the major immunodominant antigens of eggs have been identified  <cit> . indeed, an egg-secreted ribonuclease, omega- <dig>  was recently identified as the principle component of eggs that conditions dendritic cells for th <dig> polarization  <cit> . in contrast, the cd4+ t cell response to schistosome worms during the pre-patent phase of infection has been characterized as a th <dig> response  <cit> . recently we demonstrated that pre-patent schistosome infection and infections with either male or female worms alone that preclude the possibility of egg production, also induce type  <dig> responses, characterized by induction of cd4+ t cells and basophils that produce il- <dig> in response to worm antigens  <cit> . thus the immune response to developing schistosome worms during primary infection is more complex than previously appreciated and there is likely much still to learn about the immunological context within which primary schistosome infection is established. for example, the worm antigens that are the main targets of pre-patent responses have yet to be described. specific worm antigens have been identified in the context of immune resistance, such as in vaccinated animals  <cit>  and putatively resistant human subjects  <cit> , but the significance of these antigens during normal permissive infection has not been explored.

in this study, we attempted to identify worm antigens that stimulate cd4+ t cell responses during permissive primary infection, as these antigens may be involved in stimulating responses that facilitate schistosome worm development. because cd4+ t cell responses to individual antigens are difficult to detect directly in mice, owing to the low frequency of cd4+ t cells with specificity for any single antigen  <cit> , we used isotype class-switching of antibody responses as a marker for cd4+ t cell responses, since antibody isotype-switching by b cells requires cognate cd4+ t cell help  <cit> . our results reveal that the parasite gut-associated s. mansoni cysteine protease cathepsin b <dig>   <cit>  is an immunodominant target of adaptive responses during pre-patent infection, demonstrating that the pre-patent response to schistosome worms is focused and specific, and is not simply characterized by immunosuppression or nonspecific polyclonal responses. further analysis of the pre-patent response demonstrated the rapid establishment of an antigen-specific ige response to smcb <dig>  which was dependent on t cell help and il- <dig> but independent of schistosome eggs. analysis of human subjects who reside in endemic areas suggests that smcb <dig> is also the target of ige responses in humans. together our data suggest that, like schistosome eggs, schistosome worms also induce type  <dig> responses and that a worm cysteine protease is involved in type  <dig> response induction.

RESULTS
immunodominant worm antigens targeted by adaptive responses during pre-patent infection
to identify the earliest evidence of class-switching in the humoral response to worm antigens during pre-patent infection, elisas using plate-bound soluble worm antigen  were used to detect swap-specific igm, igg <dig> and igg2b in plasma of infected mice at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks post infection . the first significant production of non-igm antibodies with specificity for worm antigens was detected at  <dig> weeks post infection, when swap-specific igg <dig> was detected . to identify the worm antigens targeted by this igg <dig> response during primary schistosome infection, a swap preparation was probed by immunoblot, using plasma from mice that were infected for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> weeks. bound antibodies were detected with enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies specific for murine igm, igg <dig>  and igg2b and total mouse igg. results obtained with anti-igg <dig> are presented in figure  <dig>  similar results were obtained with anti-igm and pan-specific anti-igg secondary antibodies . using anti-igg <dig>  no reactivity was detected at  <dig> weeks  and  <dig> weeks  post infection, but intense reactivity with an apparent single species of approximately  <dig> kda molecular mass was evident by  <dig> weeks post infection . in concordance with this result, the presence of worm antigen-specific igg <dig> was also first detected at  <dig> weeks post infection using a whole worm antigen-based elisa . by  <dig> weeks post infection , weak reactivity with additional species of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda was also evident, in addition to the  <dig> kda species. thus, the humoral response during a primary, pre-patent schistosome infection predominantly targets a worm antigen or antigens of approximately  <dig> kda. furthermore, the production of antigen-specific igg suggests this antigen is also the target of a cd4+ t helper response, because isotype class-switching by b cells to production of isotypes other than igm requires cognate cd4+ t cell help, in the form of cytokines and cd40-cd40l interactions  <cit> .

smcb <dig> is the target of an ige response during pre-patent schistosome infection
previous studies have shown that the s. mansoni gut protease cathepsin b <dig> , the mature form of which has a molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda, is highly antigenic during schistosome infection, both in human patients  <cit>  and in experimentally infected mice  <cit> . thus we hypothesized that the  <dig> kda species recognized by the pre-patent response shown in figure  <dig> corresponded to smcb <dig>  to test this hypothesis, we tested plasma samples from infected mice for the presence of smcb1-specific antibodies by elisa, using recombinant, non-glycosylated smcb <dig> as antigen. using this more sensitive technique, smcb1-specific igm was detectable in plasma as early as  <dig> weeks post infection . isotype class-switching of the anti-smcb <dig> response became apparent at  <dig> weeks post infection, when smcb1-specific igg <dig> antibodies were first detected in plasma . by  <dig> weeks post infection, smcb1-specific igg2b  and, unexpectedly, ige  antibodies were also detectable. these data indicate that the smcb <dig> protein is a target of humoral responses during pre-patent schistosome infection. furthermore, detection of class-switching in the response to the smcb <dig> protein suggests that a cd4+ t helper response to smcb <dig> is mounted in parallel with the antibody response, as isotype switching requires cognate t cell help  <cit> . finally, the detection of smcb1-specific igg <dig>  and especially ige  suggests that smcb1-specific cd4+ t cells produce il- <dig>  as b cell class-switching to production of these isotypes requires cognate t cell help from il-4-producing cd4+ t cells  <cit> .

rapid induction of smcb1-specific ige in the absence of schistosome eggs
while previous reports suggested that cd4+ t cells primarily mount th <dig> responses to worm antigens during pre-patent infection  <cit> , we recently showed that schistosome worms also induce il-4-producing cd4+ t cells during pre-patent infection, which could therefore serve as a source of th <dig> help for the ige response demonstrated in figure  <dig>  alternatively, th <dig> polarization of the cd4+ t cell response to smcb <dig> could be the result of unexpectedly early oviposition, as schistosome eggs and egg antigens are potent, autonomous inducers of th <dig> responses that could bias concomitant responses to worm antigens. to test this latter hypothesis, we examined ige responses in mice infected with only male or female worms, thus precluding any possibility that the animals were exposed to eggs. infection with either male or female worms alone both induced significant increases in total plasma ige concentrations by  <dig> weeks post infection, with male-only infections inducing more ige than female worms . furthermore, male-only and female-only infections also induced smcb1-specific ige responses by  <dig> weeks post infection, with males again inducing more ige than females . thus, exposure to either male or female worms was sufficient for rapid induction of total and antigen-specific ige. the results also demonstrate that total and smcb1-specific ige responses are not induced as a result of early oviposition. that male worms induced more total and smcb1-specific ige than did female worms may be due to the abnormal development of female worms in the absence of males  <cit> .

t cell help and il- <dig> are required for smcb1-specific ige production during pre-patent infection
to test whether worm-induced pre-patent th <dig> responses, such as the those we have described recently  <cit> , are involved in class-switching of the anti-smcb <dig> response to ige, we tested whether the smcb1-specific ige response was dependent on cd4+ t cell help and il- <dig>  first, we examined worm-induced ige responses in mice where provision of cd4+ t cell help to b cells is prevented through disruption of mhc ii gene expression. consistent with a role for cd4+ t cell help in the smcb1-specific ige response, smcb1-specific ige antibodies were not detected in the plasma of infected mhc ii-/- mice , despite the fact these animals express constitutively high levels of nonspecific natural ige  <cit> . second, to test the role of il- <dig> in the generation of smcb1-specific ige, il- <dig> activity was blocked in vivo by administration of a neutralizing anti-il- <dig> monoclonal antibody. neutralization of il- <dig> completely ablated the production of both total  and smcb1-specific ige  at  <dig> weeks post infection, demonstrating that these responses require il- <dig>  in contrast levels of smcb1-specific igg <dig> and igg2b were either not affected or augmented by anti-il- <dig> treatment , demonstrating that this treatment did not result in a general impairment of b cell responses. together, these data suggest that the smcb1-specific ige response during pre-patent infection is dependent on a concomitant il-4-producing cd4+ t helper response to worm antigens.

natural human exposure to schistosome worms induces ige responses to smcb1
as smcb <dig> appears to be a potent inducer of antigen-specific ige responses in infected mice before the onset of egg production, we questioned whether similar responses were induced in humans exposed to schistosome infection. because human cases of acute schistosome infection, prior to the onset of oviposition, are rarely detected, we chose instead to analyze a cohort of egg-negative or putatively resistant  brazilian subjects, who are exposed to schistosome worm antigens but presumably do not experience high levels of egg antigens, as they never show evidence of active, patent infection, i.e. parasite eggs are not detectable in the stool and egg-induced pathology does not develop  <cit> . sera from endemic normal subjects contained ige antibodies specific for swap and smcb <dig> , suggesting that, as in mice, human exposure to schistosome worms is sufficient to induce antigen-specific ige, in the absence of substantial exposure to eggs. indeed, endemic normal patients exhibited significantly higher levels of smcb1-specific ige than did susceptible subjects who experience patent schistosome infections . in contrast, patients with a history of patent infection exhibited higher levels of swap-specific igg <dig> than did endemic normal subjects, consistent with the association of igg <dig> antibodies with chronic patent schistosomiasis  <cit> .

discussion
the haploid genomes of the schistosoma contain upwards of  <dig>  ×  <dig> base pairs and are predicted to encode for  <dig>  or more genes  <cit> . while not all these genes are expressed during the intramammalian phase of the life cycle  <cit> , it is nonetheless unexpected that such an apparently limited number of gene products are recognized by the host immune system after  <dig> weeks of exposure to the developing worms. while other protein species are clearly targeted by the humoral response during pre-patent infection  <cit> , , our data suggest that the majority of the antigen-specific antibodies produced during the first five weeks of infection target an antigen of approximately  <dig> kda. while we cannot exclude the possibility that other protein species are responsible for some of the reactivity in the  <dig> kda band, the data in figure  <dig> indicate that smcb <dig>  a known immunogenic protein of  <dig> kda molecular mass , is the target of a robust humoral response during the first four weeks of infection. furthermore, the appearance of smcb1-specific antibodies at two weeks post infection and the subsequent amplification and class-switching of the response over the following weeks correlates with the known temporal expression pattern of smcb <dig>  performing a central nutritive function in the degradation of host proteins within the parasite gut  <cit> , smcb <dig> expression is detectable in cercariae  <cit>  and newly transformed schistosomula  <cit> and is maintained into adulthood  <cit> .

while it is tempting to speculate that immune evasion mechanisms employed by the parasite to minimize immune recognition, such as molecular camouflage and mimicry, are factors in limiting the number of antigens to which responses are detected, other mechanisms may contribute to focus the adaptive response on smcb <dig>  first, the schistosome regularly regurgitates its gut contents, including smcb <dig>  making the protein available for interaction with the immune system. second, the potentially inflammatory remains of regurgitated host cells  <cit>  may act as an adjuvant for the comingled smcb <dig> when it is encountered by antigen-presenting cells. finally, recent findings have suggested that cysteine protease activities present immunostimulatory molecular motifs, akin to toll-like receptor ligands such as lipopolysaccharide, but which preferentially initiate th <dig> responses rather than th <dig> responses  <cit> . because vertebrates do not secrete cysteine proteases  <cit> , it is hypothesized that the vertebrate immune system has evolved sensors for the presence of cysteine proteases in extracellular spaces and interprets their presence as a "danger signal". this mechanism may explain the th <dig> priming properties of helminths and allergens, as significant cysteine protease activity is frequently associated with these two classes of immunostimulatory agents  <cit> .

in other pathogens, focused responses to immunodominant antigens contribute to pathogen persistence and transmission. for example, in viruses capable of rapid genetic change, such as retroviruses  <cit> , orthomyxoviruses  <cit>  and hepadnaviruses  <cit> , responses to immunodominant epitopes can select for escape mutants that avoid immune killing, resulting in viral persistence and transmission to new hosts. in more complex eukaryotic pathogens such as trypanosoma, narrowly focused responses to immunodominant antigens, such as the variant surface glycoproteins of african trypanosomes  <cit>  and members of the highly diverse trans-sialidase gene family of t. cruzi  <cit> , provide the parasites with a mechanism for immune evasion through antigenic variation. in toxoplasma gondii, extreme focusing of the immune response on certain immunodominant members of the srs  family of surface antigens may promote parasite survival by distracting the host response away from other epitopes  <cit> . focused immune responses to immunodominant antigens can therefore confer survival and transmission advantages, resulting in selection for and conservation of immunodominant antigens in a wide variety of unrelated pathogens. it is tempting to speculate that smcb <dig> serves a similar function for schistosomes by inducing responses that are advantageous to the parasite, perhaps by stimulating cd4+ t cell responses that provide essential signals for parasite development  <cit> . the possibility that secreted parasite proteases may have functions that extend beyond their nutritive role warrants further investigation. indeed, schistosomes are known to release catalytically inactive forms of proteases  <cit> , with amino acid sequences that are almost identical to the active forms, suggesting these molecules have functions distinct from host protein degradation.

while schistosome eggs are thought to be the major stimulus for th <dig> response induction during schistosome infection  <cit> , we recently demonstrated that schistosome worms induce type  <dig> responses before oviposition begins  <cit> . by showing here that in vivo ablation of cognate t cell help or blockade of il- <dig> signaling both prevented the pre-patent smcb1-specific ige response, our data suggest that the pre-patent th <dig> response to worms is functional and provides help for humoral responses to antigens such as smcb <dig>  interestingly, th <dig> response induction by pre-patent schistosome infection has been documented previously. exposure of mice and humans to cercariae of the avian schistosome trichobilharzia regenti, which does not result in patent infection, also results in induction of ige responses and sensitization of basophils to produce il- <dig>  <cit> . whether pre-patent th <dig> responses influence the development of subsequent th <dig> responses to schistosome eggs remains to be tested, but the hypothesis that pre-patent infection primes the subsequent anti-egg response has been proposed by others  <cit> .

our analysis of sera from human subjects exposed to schistosome infection demonstrates that smcb <dig> is also the target of an ige response in humans. that putatively resistant individuals exhibit significantly higher levels of smcb1-specific ige than infected subjects agrees with various other data that implicate parasite-specific ige in mediating protective functions upon exposure to schistosome infection  <cit> . for example, high levels of specific ige correlate with acquisition of resistance to re-infection in humans  <cit>  and specific ige is suspected to mediate parasite killing in some laboratory animal models of schistosome infection  <cit> . however, resistance in well-defined cohorts of putatively resistant brazilian subjects is thought to be mediated by th <dig> responses to worm antigens  <cit> , similar to the immunity induced in mice by exposure to irradiated cercariae  <cit> . an alternative explanation for our finding is that persistent il- <dig> production in chronically infected individuals leads to diminished ige production and elevated igg <dig> titers  <cit> . in this case, high smcb1-specific ige levels in putatively resistant subjects could be explained by the absence of chronic infection in these individuals. on the other hand, there is evidence that responses to certain antigens, such as the s. mansoni tetraspanins tsp- <dig> and tsp- <dig>  may contribute to resistance in putatively resistant subjects  <cit> , so the role of smcb <dig> as a protective antigen may warrant further investigation. it is plausible that a protease with significant nutritive function that is expressed from the very beginning of infection may be a target of protective immune responses. immune responses to another worm protease, calpain, can mediate significant resistance to challenge infection  <cit>  suggesting that proteases are viable targets for future vaccines.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our data suggest that smcb <dig> is an immunodominant target of the immune response during pre-patent schistosome infection and that the response to this cysteine protease exhibits hallmarks of a th <dig> response. these findings suggest that, in addition to the nutritive function associated with its proteolytic activity, smcb <dig> may serve in an immunological capacity to induce responses that influence the outcome of schistosome infection. modulation of immune responses to proteases might therefore impede the establishment of schistosome infections and represent a novel approach to the treatment and/or prophylaxis of schistosomiasis.
