BACKGROUND
we recently described methods aimed at unifying classical and genomic classification of bacteriophages by integration of protein sequence data and physicochemical parameters. we developed two protein sequence similarity-based tools, coreextractor and coregenes  <cit> , to parse-out and quantify relationships between pairs of phages resulting in a single correlation score  <cit> . this analysis is followed by a deconstruction and literature analysis of the known morphological and physicochemical characteristics of these phages. the biological interpretation of molecular correlations between  <dig> fully sequenced podoviridae show that this approach agrees with the current phage classification of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses  and suggests that, generally, horizontal gene transfer only partially masks evolutionary relationships between phages. using a cut-off value of 40% homologous proteins, we verified relationships between phages known to be similar and identified several new bacteriophage genera. at the 20-30% homology level, we identified relationships of a higher order justifying the introduction of the subfamily taxonomical category.

the myoviridae in the viiith ictv report comprise five genera of bacteriophages  and one genus of archeal viruses, phih. i <dig> and phikz-like phages have been recently proposed as additional genera http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ictvdb/ictv/fs_myovi.htm. these genera include only a small fraction of presently known myoviruses with fully sequenced genomes  <cit> . we analyze and interpret here the correlations between  <dig> myoviridae genomes found in the national center for biotechnology information  and the tulane university t <dig> genome databases.

 <dig>  t4-like viruses nova comb
the ictv currently lists only six sequenced viruses as members of the t <dig> phage genus, namely enterobacterial phage t <dig>  acinetobacter phage  <dig>  aeromonas phages aeh <dig>   <dig> and 44rr <dig> t, and vibrio phage nt- <dig>  however, the scientific literature and public databases abound with descriptions of "t4-like" phages and the analysis of complete genome sequences indicates that the t4-related phages constitute one of the largest groups of bacterial viruses. this corroborates ecogenomic studies on the diversity of these viruses as apparent in the heterogeneity of capsid  genes in isolates from japanese rice fields  <cit> , marine systems  <cit> , and from lithuania  <cit> , bangladesh and switzerland  <cit> . these studies suggest that the fully sequenced t <dig> phages are but a small fraction of the t4-related genomes in nature. nevertheless, there are clear commonalities among all sequenced "t4-like" genomes from different host groups, including the cyanophages, namely a set of 33- <dig> genes that have persisted during the evolution of genomes with sizes from  <dig> to  <dig> kb  <cit> . this core of genes seems to have resisted divergence throughout evolution. nevertheless, these horizontal substitutions do not erase the evidence of the global relationship between phages and clear hybrid phages within this group have not been identified to date  <cit> . work done at tulane university  <cit> , led to the tentative conclusion that it takes about  <dig> t <dig> genes to determine a genetic program that controls lytic phage development in the host cell.

based on the myoviridae cluster dendrogram , the current ictv genus "t4-like viruses" can be subdivided into two genera and several subgroups. by analogy to the t7-related podoviruses, now named the autographivirinae, the former ictv genus was raised to the rank of a subfamily, the teequatrovirinae, named after the best-studied of these phages, coliphage t <dig>  the first genus, the "t4-like viruses", includes what were previously termed the t-even and "pseudo-t-even" phages  <cit> . our name perpetuates the old ictv nomenclature, but is now limited to enterobacterial and aeromonas phages. the kvp <dig> phages, consisting of two former members of the "schizo-t-evens"  <cit>  form the other genus.

the "t4-like viruses" are morphologically indistinguishable and have moderately elongated heads of about  <dig> nm in length,  <dig> nm long tails with a collar, base plates with short spikes, and six long kinked tail fibers. within this assemblage, we identified four distinct subtypes with >70% protein similarity. these are the t4-type phages , 44rr-type , rb43-type , and the rb49-type viruses . they can be subdivided by the presence of specific encoded proteins as outlined in table  <dig>  in the subtype t <dig> phages, three specific proteins with defined functions  were found. pin is an inhibitor of the host's lon protease  <cit> , while the other two proteins function to modulate transcription  <cit> .

heteroduplex analyses indicate that coliphages t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> share >85% sequence similarity  <cit> , warranting their inclusion, in spite of lack of detailed sequence data for t <dig> and t <dig>  into the t4-type subgroup. the dna of the t-even phages contains 5-hydroxymethylcytosine . while this modified nucleotide is common in t4-related phages  <cit> , its presence has not been ascertained biochemically in the other phages  included in this subgroup. t <dig> gp <dig> dcmp hydroxymethylase and alc that blocks transcription from cytosine containing dna are required for the incorporation of 5-hmc rather than cytosine into t-even dna. genes specifying homologs of the t <dig> gp <dig> and alc proteins are also present in the 44rr <dig> t-type phages.

 <dig>  kvp40-like viruses
the kvp <dig> viruses comprise two marine vibriophages, kvp <dig> and nt- <dig>  with genomes of approximately  <dig> kb. kvp <dig> infects vibrio parahaemolytius and was isolated from seawater. phage nt- <dig> infects vibrio natriegens and originates from a coastal marsh. the phages differ from t <dig> in head length , but are identical to phage t <dig> in tail morphology. kvp <dig> has a feather of decoration proteins on its head  <cit> .

three other t <dig> phages do not fit into these groups: acinetobacter phage  <dig>  aeromonas hydrophila phage aeh <dig> and aeromonas salmonicida phage  <dig>  morphologically, phage  <dig> is identical to t <dig>  whereas aeh <dig> and  <dig> have the same heads of  <dig> nm in length as vibrio phages kvp <dig> and nt- <dig>  they were considered to be part of the "schizo-t-even" group  <cit>  and have a t4-type tail structure  <cit> . coregenes and our supplementary phylogenetical analyses indicate that these phages are too dissimilar, by our criteria, to be included into one of the genera listed above.

the four marine cyanophages  infect synechococcus or prochlorococcus strains and harbor t <dig> genes causing this group to be named the "exo-t-evens"  <cit> . these phages have isometric heads and much longer tails than t <dig>  coregenes analysis indicates that they form a group sharing >40% proteins in common. while p-ssm <dig>  p-ssm <dig> and syn <dig> share  <dig> proteins, they show considerable dissimilarity in appearance, size, and dna content . phylogenetic analysis based upon sequence alignments of gp <dig>  and photosystem ii protein d <dig>  <cit>  indicate considerable diversity exist among cultured and environmental cyanophages. this is also confirmed by an analysis of data from the marine virome from the sorcerer ii global ocean sampling expedition  <cit> . based upon these observations, we feel that the creation of genera within cyanophage myoviruses is premature at the present time.

*from published micrographs.

rhodothermus marinus phage rm <dig>  is a virus said to have a head of  <dig> ×  <dig> nm and a tail of  <dig> nm in length  <cit> . it was called a "thermot-even phage" by filée et al.  <cit> , but our coregenes analysis reveals that its proteins shows minimal sequence similarity to any t4-related virus.

ii. peduovirinae
this subfamily is a large phage group derived from the ictv genus "p2-like phages" and is named the peduovirinae. virions have heads of  <dig> nm in diameter and tails of  <dig> ×  <dig> nm. phages are easily identified because contracted sheaths tend to slide off the tail core. the subfamily falls into three different groups. as shown by coreextractor and coregenes analyses, and using the 40% similarity criterion for inclusion into the same genus, phage hp <dig> has only  <dig> genes in common p <dig>  even if other p <dig> phages are considered, hp <dig> shares only  <dig> genes with any phage of the "p2-like" genus. using the 40% similarity criterion for inclusion into the same genus, it is therefore justified to consider p <dig> and hp <dig> as members of different genera and to upgrade the present genus "p <dig> phages" to a subfamily.

 <dig>  p2-like viruses nova comb
this genus includes p <dig> itself and its extensively studied relative, coliphage  <dig>  both originate from the pasteur institute in paris, france. phage p <dig> is one of three phages  isolated by g. bertani in the beginning of the 1950's from the "li"  strain of e. coli  <cit> . later on, f. jacob and e. wollman isolated phage  <dig> and many other viruses from enterobacteria collected by l. le minor  <cit> . the reason for the early interest in these phages was that p <dig> and  <dig> are temperate. the analysis of the genetic control of these two modes was the starting point for ongoing fertile research on phage biology and molecular biology in general.

the genomes of phage p <dig> and  <dig> were the first p <dig> genomes to be fully sequenced and analyzed. almost all p <dig> and  <dig> genes have been assigned a function  <cit> . coliphages wΦ and l-413c are very similar to p <dig> in both gene content and gene order. they are closely related to each other, sharing all but one protein. the only genes of these phages that differ from p <dig> are the lysogeny-related genes, which may have been horizontally acquired and are totally different, but have been inserted at the same locations into all genomes. the only exception to this is that phage p <dig> has a  <dig> bp orf  with unknown function inserted between the s and v genes. there is no such insertion in wΦ and l-413c, but pseudomonas phage Φctx  has another uncharacterized orf located at this position. enterobacterial phages  <dig>  psp <dig>  fels- <dig>  and sopeΦ also share their overall gene order and many genes with p <dig>  but the genes are more diverged. unlike p <dig>  these phages are uv-inducible due to the presence of the tum gene. in addition, they have a different lysis-lysogeny switch region. p <dig> phages seem to have either of two different proteins for repression of the lytic cycle. p <dig>  wΦ and l-413c have the repressor gene c whereas  <dig>  psp <dig>  fels- <dig>  sopeΦ, hp <dig>  hp <dig>  and k <dig>  instead have the sequence-unrelated genes ci and cii, both of which are equally needed for establishing lysogeny.

mannheimia phage Φ-mhaa1-phl <dig>  pseudomonas phageΦctx, and ralstonia phage rsa <dig> have many p <dig> genes and an overall order of structural genes that is p2-like, although interspersed with some uncharacterized genes. their presumed regulatory gene regions include additional putative and uncharacterized orfs. phage Φctx has only the p <dig> regulatory gene ogr  and the recombination enzyme int , Φ-mhaa1-phl <dig> has repressor  and antirepressor  equivalents which are most closely related to the regulatory proteins of the p22-like enterobacteria phage st <dig> than to p <dig> 

phage rsa <dig> seems to have only one p2-related regulatory gene, the ogr gene, although it is more related to the ogr/delta-like gene in Φctx. the rsa <dig> integrase is more similar to the integrases of the p2-like burkholderia phages  and two peripherally related viruses, lactobacillus plantarum phage lp <dig>  <cit>  and enterococcus faecalis phage φef24c  <cit> . all of these are virulent, broad-host range phages which infect members of the firmicutes. they possess isometric heads of 87- <dig> nm in diameter and conspicuous capsomers, striated 140- <dig> nm long tails, a double base plate, and globular structures at the tail tip. the latter have been resolved as base plate spikes and short kinked tail fibers with six-fold symmetry  <cit> . members of this group usually possess large  nonpermuted genomes with  <dig> - <dig> kb terminal redundancies  <cit> . the proposed name for this subfamily is derived from spo plus una .

while the head diameter of bacillus phage spo <dig>  of  <dig> nm  <cit> , is consistent with membership in the group, its tail is significantly shorter than that of most members   <cit> , and, the dna contains 5-hydroxymethyluracil  rather than thymine. the outliers of this group comprise phages lp <dig>  <cit>  and φef24c  <cit> . at  <dig> nm, the tail of phage lp <dig> is similar in length to that of other members of this group, but its genome is not terminally redundant  <cit> . lastly, the genome size , proteome and morphology of enterococcus phage φef24c is clearly consistent with membership in this group , but its genome is circularly permuted. their close relationship was discussed in a recent paper  <cit> .

using a blastp raw threshold score of  <dig> and coregenes  <dig>  http://binf.gmu.edu:8080/coregenes <dig> / to compare the proteomes of twort, a <dig>  lp <dig>  and φef24c against spo <dig>  we identified two clusters of genes which are conserved. these corresponded to packaging and morphogenesis genes ; and the cluster of replication genes, including helicase, exonuclease, primase, and resolvase . the dna polymerases  of these phages are related more closely to bacterial-type i dna polymerases than other phage deoxynucleotide polymerizing enzymes. the presence of host-related proteins in viruses has been observed by dinsdale et al.  <cit>  and elegantly explained by serwer  <cit> . metagenomic studies by the former group indicate the presence of numerous host-related proteins, including those related to motility and chemotaxis, in the virome fractions. while the functional significance of photosynthetic protein psba in cyanophage genomes has been conclusively shown  <cit> , the presence of host-related sequences should still be considered with healthy skepticism if the only data is the presence of homologs.

 <dig>  spo1-like viruses
the current ictv genus "spo <dig> viruses" comprises some  <dig> bacillus phages and lactobacillus phage 222a; only the genome of spo <dig> has been sequenced  <cit> . all spo1-like bacillus phage genomes that have been studied contain 5-hydroxymethyluracil  instead of thymine and encode dump hydroxymethylase activity . this phage also contains the unique 171-amino acid head decoration protein gp <dig> . whether this is unique to members of this genus will require the sequencing of additional genomes. using cryo-electron microscopy, duda and coworkers  <cit>  confirmed the earlier observation  <cit>  that the icosahedral head of spo <dig> head has the triangulation number t =  <dig> rather than the more common t =  <dig>  this feature is also shared with eukaryotic herpesviruses.

 <dig>  twort-like viruses
the phages form a fairly homogeneous group of virulent phages infecting staphylococci   <cit>  and listeria   <cit> . the group is named after phage "twort," which may be a descendant of the original bacteriophage described by f.w. twort in  <dig>  <cit> . apparently, this phage was deposited at the pasteur institute of paris in  <dig> when twort was invited there to retell the story of his discovery .

b. additional ictv-recognized genera
 <dig>  mu-like viruses
phage mu is morphologically almost identical to phage p <dig>  although phage mu shares features  with bcepmu  <cit>  and two siphoviruses, pseudomonas phages b <dig> and d <dig>  <cit> , this phage holds a unique position within the myoviridae, since its proteome displays only limited homology to any other completely sequenced phage genome.

mu and p <dig> have only  <dig> proteins in common . p <dig> differs from mu by genome size , the number of proteins , gene order, and the presence of a single capsid protein and cohesive ends in its dna. by contrast, mu has two capsid proteins and two sets of tail fiber genes and replicates via transposition, which is a very rare mode of replication. mu shares this characteristic with bcepmu, but bcepmu has no tail fiber inversion system and only a limited proteomic correlation to mu .

only coliphage d <dig>  as shown by heteroduplex analysis, shows significant similarity to mu to warrant inclusion in the mu genus  <cit> . unfortunately, only portions of the genome of d <dig> have been sequenced. putative mu proviruses have been reported in a wide range of bacteria  <cit> . coregenes analysis revealed that only some of them can be reasonably described as mu proviruses, namely, escherichia blattae prophage mueb  <cit> , haemophilus influenzae rd prophage hin-mu  <cit> , and shewanella oneidensis prophage muso <dig> .

 <dig>  p1-like viruses
this small genus comprises coliphage p <dig>  famous for its cre recombinase and the large-insert cloning vectors engineered on the basis of the phage genome  <cit> , p <dig>  and its not yet sequenced putative relative d <dig>  phage p <dig> stands out from any of the phages described here by its morphology. phage p <dig> differs from the phages described here by size and morphology. it has a very large head of approximately  <dig> nm in diameter and a very long tail of  <dig> ×  <dig> nm in the extended state. tails have base plates and  <dig> nm long, kinked fibers. the tails of related, not yet sequenced phages of enterobacteria and aeromonas vary between  <dig> and  <dig> nm in length. all phages of this group produce three types of head-size variants .

c. additional genera within the myoviridae
 <dig>  bcep781-like viruses
"bcep" stands for burkholderia cepacia, and phages with this designation infect bacteria belonging to the b. cepacia genomic complex. the bcep <dig> phages form a group of virulent myophages of which the genome sequence of five members, bcep <dig>  bcep <dig>  bcep <dig>  bcepny <dig> and xanthomonas phage op <dig>  is known  <cit> . the bcep <dig> phages are small viruses with distinctly shorter tails than p <dig>  mu, and bcepmu  <cit> .

the genomes of these phages range from  <dig> to  <dig> kb in size and encode  <dig> to  <dig> proteins. the four bcep phages encode a single trna each. they form a homogeneous phage group not just in terms of sequence, but also by their distinctive genome organization compared to other groups. the genomes of the bcep <dig> phages are divided into four gene clusters encoded on alternate strands such that, using bcep <dig> as the example, genes  <dig> through  <dig> and  <dig> through  <dig> are present on the bottom strand while genes  <dig> through  <dig> and  <dig> through  <dig> are present on the top strand. head genes are located in the first cluster and tail genes are located in the third cluster. the virion major capsid and decoration proteins, bcep <dig> gp <dig> and gp <dig>  were identified by protein sequencing and show some similarity to head proteins from the "pb1-like viruses" group. several tail morphogenesis proteins, corresponding to bcep <dig> gp <dig> through gp <dig>  can be linked to p <dig> tail genes by psi-blast. in contrast to structural genes, genes for dna replication and lysis are scattered throughout the genome. the lysis genes of these phages are not organized into a cassette but instead overlapping rz and rz <dig> genes are separated from the endolysin and holin genes  <cit> . a distinctive feature of these phages is the presence of highly, maybe completely, circularly permuted genomes. the terminases of these phages are strongly related to other pac-type phages that also have highly permuted genomes  <cit> .

 <dig>  bcepmu-like viruses
this group was named "bcepmu-like viruses" because, like mu and unlike most other phages, its members utilize transposition for replication. the distinctive genomic feature implicating the use of replicative transposition is the presence of random host dna sequences at either end of the packaged virion dna  <cit> . these host sequences are derived from excision of prophage dna from random sites scattered over the host genome. this requires fundamental differences in terminase function as compared to more typical terminases that utilize concatemers of phage genomic dna as a substrate. this is reflected by the homology between bcepmu terl and mu terl. another genome feature shared by bcepmu and mu is the presence of genomic terminal ca dinucleotide repeats, a feature common in many transposons. furthermore, bcepmu and mu seem to be morphologically identical.

despite these similarities, bcepmu and its close relative φe <dig> have marked differences in genome organization and minimal overall protein sequence similarity to mu, explaining why they have not been grouped together. the putative bcepmu transposase is not related to the mu transposase, tnpa, but instead is a distant member of the tn552-is <dig> transposase family. the bcepmu genome is organized into two clusters, with genes  <dig> through  <dig> encoded on the bottom strand and genes  <dig> through  <dig> on the top strand. the cluster of bottom strand genes includes transcription regulators, the transposase, and a number of small genes of unknown function. the lysogeny control region is likely to include genes  <dig> and  <dig>  located at the interface of the bottom strand/top strand gene clusters. this is followed by a lysis cassette consisting genes encoding a holin, endolysin, rz and rz <dig>  proteins  <dig> through  <dig> encompass the head and tail morphogenesis cassette. the bcepmu tail biosynthetic cassette proteins are recognizably related both in sequence and in gene order to those of coliphage p <dig> 

bcepmu is present as a prophage in many b. cenocepacia strains of the human pathogenic et <dig> lineage  <cit> . phage φe <dig> is a phage of the soil saprophyte b. thailandensis . bcepmu phages, however, are not limited to burkholderia hosts as related prophage elements have been identified in the genomic sequence of many other bacteria, for example chromobacterium violaceum .

 <dig>  felix o1-like viruses
salmonella phage felix o <dig> has a relatively large head  and a tail of  <dig> ×  <dig> nm characterized by subunits overlapping each other like roof tiles and showing a criss-cross pattern like phages pb- <dig> and f <dig>  notably, it exhibits small collars and eight straight tail fibers. upon contraction, the base plate separates from the sheath. the type virus felix o <dig> is widely known as a diagnostic salmonella-specific phage  <cit> . until recently, the genomic sequence  of phage felix o <dig> was unique and was considered, as such, a "genomic orphan", but two related genomes have been recently characterized, though their sequences have yet to be deposited to the public databases. they are coliphage wv <dig> and erwinia amylovora phage φea21- <dig>  and halomonas aquamarina phage φhap- <dig>  <cit> . both are temperate viruses possessing 38- <dig> kb genomes which lack integrase genes. while our proteomic analysis and the literature suggests that vibrio harveyi phage vhml  <cit>  should be included in this genus, there is no evidence that this phage can be propagated: it is only produced after induction, does not plaque, and must be considered a defective prophage. the data presented by mobberley et al.  <cit>  show that φhap- <dig> exists as a linear prophage in lysogens and possesses a protelomerase  and a partitioning protein  which are homologous to proteins encoded by vhml and vp <dig>  while these viruses share some homology with the coliphage p <dig>  this is largely restricted to the genes associated with tail morphogenesis v  and f operons . based upon their radically different life cycle from the other p <dig> phages, we have chosen not to include them in the peduovirinae.

 <dig>  bzx1-like or i3-like viruses
myoviruses are exquisitely rare in the actinobacteria . phages i <dig>  bzx <dig> and catera are characterized by heads of  <dig> nm in diameter and unusually short tails of  <dig> nm in length with a cup-shaped base plate. they do not resemble any other mycobacteriophages nor any other myovirus. we propose that this genus contains the following eight mycobacterium smegmatis bacteriophages: i <dig>  bxz <dig>  cali, catera, myrna, rizal, scottmcg and spud. phage i <dig>  which has been the first to be described, is the type virus of the newly proposed myovirus genus although it has not yet been fully sequenced. within this assemblage, we identified a distinct subtype which show >90% protein similarity to bxz <dig>  and genomes of 154- <dig> kb  <cit> . mycobacteriophage myrna, with a genome of  <dig> kb, shares approximately 45% of proteins with the bxz <dig> subgroup phages. interesting features include the presence of adenylosuccinate synthase homologs among the bxz <dig> subgroup  and its absence in the genome of myrna. the latter possesses several proteins not present in the bxz <dig> group, including the large hypothetical proteins gp <dig>  and gp <dig> , a putative nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase  and atp-dependent protease .

 <dig>  phicd119-like viruses
these are all integrative temperate phages of clostridium difficile with genomes ranging from 51- <dig> kb in size and a mol%g+c of  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> . the genus is named after its first fully sequenced member. in each case, the electron micrographs are of poor quality  <cit>  or the measurements are very variable with large standard deviations  <cit> . virus head diameters are given as 50- <dig> nm and tail lengths are said to range from  <dig> to  <dig> nm  <cit> . in certain cases, their annotation is also questionable, the multiple repressor/antirepressors annotated in the genomes of Φcd <dig> and φc <dig> do not appear to contain helix-turn-helix or other dna binding motifs  <cit> ; nor the presence, in the latter phage, of para/parb homologs. what unites these viruses, in addition to similar proteomes, is the presence in each of a cytosine-c <dig> specific dna methylase  and a dna replication cassette composed of three proteins: a dnad , a hypothetical protein  and a single-stranded dna binding protein.

 <dig>  phikz-like viruses
phages φkz and el are members of a group of giant phages isolated, to date, only in pseudomonas species. their heads are isometric,  <dig> nm in diameter, and they possess  <dig> nm-long tails. the phage heads contain an inner body. the dna of φkz is over  <dig> kb in size and has  <dig> orfs, most of which are unrelated to orfs of any known protein  <cit> , while el contains  <dig> orfs within its  <dig> kb genome  <cit> . these two phages and pseudomonas phage lin <dig> have recently been proposed as part of a genus "phikz viruses"  <cit> . we now consider that the differences  between φkz and el exclude el from membership in the same genus. indeed, the recent analysis of novel pseudomonas phage 201φ2- <dig>  <cit>  showed this phage to have a strong correlation to φkz , suggesting that it is a true member of the phikz virus genus.

 <dig>  pb1-like viruses
this genus is named after the first isolated member of this group   <cit> . morphological and dna-dna hybridization studies by v. krylov indicated that the following pseudomonas phages were related: e <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  fs,  <dig>   <dig>  φc <dig>  sl <dig>  b <dig>  <cit> . the sequences of a number of viruses belonging to this genus, namely f <dig>  bcepf <dig>  pb <dig>  14- <dig>  lbl <dig>  lma <dig>  and sn  have now been completed. none of these phages encodes a recognizable integrase, suggesting that they are virulent.

phage f <dig> is one of the pseudomonas typing phages from the lindberg set which includes six more similar phages  <cit> . it possesses a 70-nm wide head with visible capsomers and a  <dig> nm-long tail, four short straight tail fibers and a base plate that separates from the sheath upon contraction. the tail exhibits no transverse striations, but presents a criss-cross pattern  <cit> . this criss-cross pattern is a rare feature that has only been observed in phage felix o <dig> 

bcepf <dig> was isolated from soil by enrichment culture  <cit>  using a burkholderia ambifaria strain as its host . the bcepf <dig> genome is  <dig> kb in size and encodes  <dig> proteins while the genome of f <dig> is  <dig> kb and encodes  <dig> proteins  <cit> . both genomes are organized into four alternating, unequal gene clusters on the top and bottom strands. the phages share  <dig> recognizable homologous proteins. the shared proteins specify virion morphogenesis, dna metabolism and packaging and include a number of hypothetical proteins of unknown function.

a striking feature of both f <dig> and bcepf <dig> is the large number of small genes, all encoding hypothetical proteins and clustered together. in bcepf <dig>  the first  <dig> kb of the genome, encoding  <dig> proteins, is devoted almost exclusively to these. in f <dig>  there are two clusters of  <dig> kb  and  <dig> kb  of primarily small hypothetical novel genes. these heterogeneous regions are largely responsible for the difference in genome size and protein content between the two phages. it has generally been assumed that these small proteins are involved in host take-over  which appears to be substantiated by the results of liu and coworkers  <cit> .

phages f <dig> and bcepf <dig> have some similarity to myophage bcepb1a, which is itself related in a mosaic fashion to the bcep <dig> group of phages  <cit> ; however, these similarities are essentially limited to morphogenetic proteins. as in the bcep <dig> phages, several putative tail assembly proteins of f <dig> and bcepf <dig> can be linked to those of p <dig> by psi-blast.

c. single phages
in addition to the phage groups listed above, complete genome sequences are available for phages without apparent relatives, namely aggregatibacter  phage aaφ23; bacillus thuringiensis phage 0305φ8- <dig>  clostridium phages c-st, escherichia phages φecom-gj <dig> and rv5; microcystis phage ma-lmm <dig>  ralstonia phage rsl <dig>  rhodothermus phage rm378; streptococcus phage ej- <dig>  and thermus phage φys <dig>  references to these phages may be found in the ncbi refseq database.

general summary
the comparison of proteomes by coregenes/coreextractor blastp programs appears to be a decisive progress in classifying tailed bacteriophages, i.e., our results corroborate the existing ictv classification of the myoviridae and are generally well compatible with other informatics-based studies , like the reticulate clustering based on gene families  <cit>  . our studies also refine certain relationships and suggest new ones. specifically, we propose three new subfamilies  and eight new genera . the individualization of genera containing two or three members as well as of genomic orphans, e.g. coliphage p <dig> without apparent homologs, is taxonomically as valuable and important as the confirmation of the large t <dig> and p <dig> groups and in total agreement with previous informatics-based classifications . our studies once again prove the utility of the dual coregenes/coreextractor approach to defining relationships between large numbers of virus genomes. these relationships carry evolutionary relevance, since our proteomic analyses, combined with the phylogenetic studies  <cit> , suggest that the myoviridae are mainly influenced by vertical evolution rather than by horizontal gene transfer. as observed in the cluster dendrogram, the clusters are populated unevenly - several include only one phage while two, the largest, include dozens phages. this reflects the fact that past phage research has focused on coliphages, and suggests that we should broaden our research to include phages from a broader range of bacteria.

comparison of our results with those of the ictv , proteomic tree  <dig> , phage_finder  and phylogeny of terminases .

among the  <dig> analyzed myoviridae, phage mu displayed the most significant evidence of horizontal gene exchange. this virus is related to three members of pilus-specific siphoviridae infecting pseudomonas aeruginosa , sharing  <dig> to 40% of its genes with each of them. these phages can be viewed as true hybrids, produced by recombination of different ancestors and, like the couple lambda/p <dig> , cross family boundaries based on tail morphology. nonetheless, the majority of myoviridae, when forced to cluster, do so in a logical manner: upgrading of the ictv genus "p <dig> phages" to the pduovirinae with two genera  is a straightforward proposal and the same is true for the spounavirinae .

relationships among t4-like phages are more complicated. we reject the postulated inclusion of the cyanophages since their overall similarity to t <dig> is too low for consideration, at least according to our criteria. comeau and krisch  <cit>  have recently recognized three groups of t4-related phages. the "near t4" group containing the t-evens, pseudo t-evens, and schizo t-evens; the "far t4" clade including exo-t <dig> phage rm378; and, the "cyano t4" assemblage. we believe that the latter are sufficiently different from the other t <dig> viruses to be excluded from the teequatrovirinae at this time. this implies that this subfamily currently contains two distinct genera: t <dig> and kvp <dig> viruses. within our restricted "t <dig> phages" genus, four subtypes were identified . this is confirmed by the phylogenetic studies of filée et al.  <cit>  and our unpublished results. since these subtypes include different species, no equivalent taxonomic level is currently available in the official ictv classification. perhaps the introduction of a "subgenus" level should be considered in order to account for the complexity of t4-related phages. alternately, a general elevation of all taxonomic levels  may be envisioned.

this study illustrates the great diversity and biological richness of tailed phages. the number of independent genera is not surprising in view of the antiquity of tailed bacteriophages, which are found in archaea and bacteria and may predate the separation of these domains. it can be expected that many more phage groups will be found or individualized in the future. for example, this study does not include giant bacillus phage g, the largest bacterial virus with a genome of  <dig>  bp and  <dig> genes  <cit>  whose sequence is not yet available for comparison.

we reiterate our statement in our publication on the taxonomy of the podoviridae, "we highly recommend that the entire genome of any newly sequenced phage be thoroughly screened  against the entrez query "viruses " databases to reveal all similarities for quick identification of potential relationships. a validation step using coregenes is essential and more precise for individual comparisons  <cit> ."

CONCLUSIONS
myoviridae can be classified by their proteomes into subfamilies and genera. this classification is in close agreement with ictv - and other informatics-based classifications.
