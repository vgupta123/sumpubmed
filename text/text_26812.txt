BACKGROUND
heat stress causes proteins to lose stability, misfold, and form aggregates, which can impair function and reduce organismal fitness . to cope with macromolecular damage, the heat shock response  transcriptionally up-regulates thermally responsive genes such as heat shock proteins , which maintain proteostasis by refolding or degrading denatured proteins and preventing aggregations  <cit> . hsps are a set of highly conserved molecular chaperone proteins of diverse multigene families, named after their molecular weight   <cit> .

although hsps as a group are highly conserved, diversity within each hsp gene family reflects evolutionary gains and losses of gene copies  <cit> . each hsp protein family includes paralogues localized to different subcellular compartments  that participate in housekeeping functions and/or respond to environmental stress . for heat-inducible forms, the transcribed heat shock factors , bind to cis-regulatory elements known as heat shock elements  and up-regulate hsp transcription . patterns of variation in hsp gene expression among taxa include expansion of additional hsp genes  <cit>  and shifts in the arrangement and position of hse elements  <cit> . among taxa, both the level of constitutive expression and the magnitude of hsp induction are associated with adaptive variation in upper thermal limits . gene structure may also play a role in hsp expression, but has not been well-studied. for example, genes with introns allow for more mrna accumulation than do intronless genes .

the eusocial hymenoptera  occupy diverse thermal environments from low to high latitudes  <cit>  and elevations  <cit> , suggesting that temperature may have played an important selective role in their evolution  <cit> . species employ a variety of behavioral  <cit>  and physiological strategies  <cit>  to reduce individual and colony-level exposure to thermal stress. however, individual foragers that leave the nest each day and immobile brood that develop in the nest are likely to encounter sufficiently high temperatures to trigger the hsr  <cit> . although key members of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> have been identified in a few species of hymenoptera , the diversity, functional properties, and regulation of molecular chaperones underlying adaptive variation in hymenopteran thermal tolerance are poorly understood.

in this study, we evaluated the diversity and evolutionary history of hsps across  <dig> species of hymenoptera and five outgroup species  spanning four insect orders. we analyzed recently published genomes of multiple species of ants , bees , and the jewel wasp  to identify orthologues within each major hsp gene family and to characterize the upstream regulatory motifs governing their transcription . we reconstructed molecular evolutionary relationships within each hsp multigene family to identify evolutionary gains and losses and tested for positive or purifying selection for each homologous hsp among lineages and across sites. to characterize the evolution of cis-regulation and identify hsps involved in the hsr, we identified cis-regulatory hses within the promoter region for each homologous hsp. we then tested whether hse presence and configuration successfully predicted inducibility in two species of ants that experience different thermal environments: the hot-climate pogonomyrmex barbatus, which inhabits deserts of the southwestern united states  <cit> , and the cool-climate aphaenogaster picea, which inhabits temperate deciduous forests of the eastern united states  <cit> . we found that ants, and probably other hymenoptera, harbor unique, lineage-specific sets of heat inducible hsps that were shaped by evolutionary gains, losses, and shifts in cis-regulation. expression patterns of these heat-inducible hsps reflect adaptive variation in thermal tolerance between p. barbatus and a. picea.

RESULTS
identification of conserved hsp and cis-regulatory hses
we recovered conserved hsps from all of the major gene families . three paralogues within the hsp <dig> gene family  were found across all surveyed insects. we recovered five of the six drosophila melanogaster hsp <dig> homologues , hsc70- <dig>  hsc70- <dig>  and hsp70cb; table 1) for hymenoptera. with the exception of nasonia vitripennis, the hymenopteran taxa all lacked the heat-inducible orthologue hsp <dig> . for all species, we recovered two paralogues of hsp <dig> . hsp <dig> gene families are one of the most diverse hsps, but we narrowed our search to dnaj- <dig>  which is the known heat-inducible paralogue of d. melanogaster . we did not recover a dnaj- <dig> paralogue from any of the insects surveyed and found the best blast match to be d. melanogaster cg <dig> . forward blast searching for d. melanogaster shsps  yielded no reciprocal blast hits; instead, the closest match was lethal  <dig> essential for life efl), for which there were 3– <dig> copies in the hymenoptera, and 1– <dig> copies in other members of the outgroup .table  <dig> summary of orthologous hsps from the combination of reciprocal blast and hmmer searches using d. melanogaster as the reference

of the hsp homologues, eight were quantifiable by qpcr and were subsequently searched for cis-regulatory hses . local alignment of the promoter regions of hsp <dig>  hsc70- <dig> , and hsp <dig> across species indicated conserved location, conformation, and arrangement of cis-regulatory hses , whereas hsc70- <dig> , hsc70- <dig>  hsp <dig>  and lefl had less conserved hses efl). for hsps with conserved hses,  <dig> hse motifs were annotated, including  <dig> head types  and  <dig> tail types . across all sampled insects, we found no consistent preference for head or tail motifs in hsp <dig> , significant preference for the head motif in hsc70- <dig> , and significant preference for the tail motif in hsp <dig> .fig.  <dig> evolutionary gains and losses in hsp <dig> within hymenoptera, followed by diversification in cis-regulatory hses. relationships of homologous hsp <dig> were reconstructed with phyml for  <dig> insect species  using a jtt substitution model with  <dig> bootstrap replicates . branches of the outgroup taxa are colored in blue and black, while well-supported paralogues of hymenopteran branches are colored in orange  and red . statistically significant episodic diversifying selection using branch-rel is indicated along the branch . cis-regulatory hses in the promoter region spanning 400 bps from the transcription start site  are mapped onto the phylogeny and are annotated by their length and motif type

phylogenetic reconstruction of hsp <dig> revealed multiple duplications and losses in both the outgroup and hymenoptera . an early duplication event in a common ancestor of the hymenoptera generated two paralogues of hsp <dig> . although both paralogues are present in bees and wasps, only one paralogue  exists in ants, indicating a secondary loss. a second duplication of the h <dig> orthologue occurred in linepithema humile. selection analysis along the length of the gene sequence indicated that most sites  and relative effects likelihood  analyses, respectively, table 2) identified purifying selection; there was no evidence for episodic diversifying selection in branches leading to hymenopteran paralogues .table  <dig> summary of selection analyses for three hsp genes

in spite of overall sequence conservation, hymenopteran hsp <dig> h <dig> differs in genomic structure and cis-regulation from hymenopteran hsp <dig> h <dig> and from outgroup species in three ways. first, hymenopteran hsp <dig> h <dig> and most outgroup species completely lack introns, whereas hsp <dig> h <dig> has two introns; apis mellifera hsp <dig> h <dig> is the exception, with one intron in hsp <dig> h <dig> . second, hymenopteran hsp <dig> h <dig> has a split hse arrangement , whereas both hsp <dig> hymenopteran h <dig> and the outgroup have a contiguous hse arrangement  at the proximal end of the molecule . third, there is a preference in head-type motifs only in hymenopteran hsp <dig> h <dig> .

hsc70-4
phylogenetic reconstruction of hsc70- <dig> indicates multiple duplication events both within species  and in a common ancestor of the hymenoptera, leading to two paralogues . each paralogue forms a strongly supported clade, with the exception of the two bombus species, in which the h <dig> paralogue is nested within the h <dig> clade but the second copy does not group with either hymenopteran paralogue . there is evidence of episodic diversifying selection along the branch preceding the hsc70- <dig> duplication in the hymenoptera and also in the hymenopteran hsc70-4 h <dig> lineage , even though most individual sites  were under purifying selection .

hymenopteran hsc70- <dig> differs in genomic structure and cis-regulatory hses from that of d. melanogaster. the orthologue of hsc70- <dig> in d. melanogaster lacks introns and cis-regulatory hses . in contrast, hymenopteran hsc70-4 h <dig> has one intron, with the exception of n. vitripennis, which has two introns. hymenopteran hsc70-4 h <dig> also has two introns, with the exception of bombus . compared to the hsc70- <dig> in members of the outgroup , both hymenopteran hsc70- <dig> paralogues showed high diversification in cis-regulatory hses, particularly at the more distal positions . at the proximal position , however, hses of hymenopteran hsc70- <dig> aligned locally with the inducible d. melanogaster hsp <dig> gene .

hsp40
both sequence and copy number of hsp <dig> were phylogenetically conserved across all insect species . most sites were under purifying selection , and there was no evidence of episodic diversifying selection along branches leading to the hymenoptera . cis-regulatory hses of hsp <dig> were concentrated in one conserved proximal block of 3– <dig> hse subunits that were located 35–100 bps upstream of the tss, although in d. melanogaster hses were located 255–285 bps upstream . however, the genetic structure appears less conserved, ranging from zero to three introns .

inducible hsp expression
we tested whether the presence or absence of conserved cis-regulatory hses successfully predicted hsp gene induction in response to experimental heat shock. the four hsp genes with conserved hses were all significantly up-regulated in response to increasing temperature treatments , hsc70-4 h <dig> , hsc70-4 h <dig> , and hsp <dig> ; fig. 4a–d). the other four hsps, which lacked conserved hses, were not significantly up-regulated after heat shock , hsc70- <dig> , hsp <dig> , and lefl ; fig. 5a–d).fig.  <dig> relative fold increase in gene expression  for four inducible hsps in a. picea and p. barbatus across different temperature treatment. relative expression of hsp <dig> , hsc70- <dig> h <dig> , hsc70- <dig> h <dig> , and hsp <dig>  were normalized to the 18 s rrna and β-actin, 18 s rrna and gapdh in a. picea  and p. barbatus , respectively. significant up-regulation from 25 °c  and 30 °c  is denoted by ‘*’ from post hoc tukey tests

species comparisons
we then tested whether variation in thermal tolerances between two ant species was accompanied by changes in hsp inducibility. the median lethal temperature  <dig>  of the warm-climate p. barbatus  was significantly higher than the lt <dig> of the cool-climate a. picea  with a binomial response variable: influence of species, p <  <dig> ; additional file 7: figure s7). these survivorship differences were matched by patterns of hsp gene expression: p. barbatus shifted its expression profile toward higher temperatures than did a. picea for all inducible hsps . for hsp <dig>  hsc70-4 h <dig>  and hsc70-4 h <dig>  p. barbatus showed peak expression at 43 °c, whereas a. picea showed peak expression at 35– <dig>  °c . for hsp <dig>  peak expression was  <dig> and 35 °c for p. barbatus and a. picea, respectively . p. barbatus exhibited significantly higher constitutive expression of hsc70-4 h <dig>  and lefl , and significantly lower constitutive expression of hsc70- <dig> , hsc70- <dig> , and hsp <dig>  than did a. picea . among the inducible hsps, there was a positive relationship between relative basal expression levels and relative inducibility .fig.  <dig> relative basal heat shock gene  expression  between p. barbatus and a. picea . relative gene expression was normalized with the geometric mean of 18 s rrna and β-actin as the calibrator  and fold change was calculated as p. barbatus relative to a. picea was calculated as follows: 2target/2calibrator. - <dig> was divided by values less than one to calculate negative relative basal expression. significant up-regulation in p. barbatus and a. picea are colored in red and blue, respectively

discussion
molecular characterization of hymenopteran hsps reveals functionally important divergence in identity, amino acid sequence, and regulation of chaperone proteins . both hsp <dig> and hsc70- <dig> display hymenoptera-specific gains and losses, resulting in unique sets of homologues. although most codons exhibited purifying selection , instances of positive selection along branches leading to and within the hymenoptera  suggest novel chaperoning activity  <cit> . this sequence divergence, coupled with cis-regulatory hse distribution and expression patterns , suggests that although there is substantial conservation of ancestral inducibility, the hsr response in hymenoptera has been additionally augmented by expansion and subfunctionalization of novel gene duplicates that are activated by thermal stress.

as in other taxonomic groups, cytoplasmic hsps mainly mediate the hsr in hymenoptera , whereas mitochondrial and er-localizing forms of hsp <dig>  <cit>  and hsp <dig> appear to play little role . the set of inducible hsps identified likely interact with one another to protect and refold denatured proteins. upon protein denaturation, hsp <dig> delivers unfolded proteins to hsp <dig>  and the two together mediate refolding through cycles of substrate binding and release driven by atp binding and hydrolysis  <cit> . despite their interdependence, however, the extent of functional diversification of hsc70- <dig> and hsp <dig> differed substantially . hsc70- <dig> showed the most dramatic variation, with the primary inducible member hsp <dig> in drosophila completely lost in hymenoptera, which instead induces two hsc70- <dig> paralogues that vary in both hse configuration and fold-increase in response to heat stress . utilization of hsc <dig> in the stress response across the insects appears to be widespread, with hses present in most of the taxa sampled . hsc70- <dig> also contains gene duplications in other taxa, suggesting that this gene family has undergone multiple evolutionary gains, losses and functional shifts. for example, culex quinquefasciatus has two paralogues, one of which is accompanied by cis-regulatory hses , suggesting that one copy is heat-inducible and the other serves housekeeping functions.

for hsp <dig>  we found two paralogues in bees and wasps, one with an ancestral contiguous arrangement of hses, and one with a derived split arrangement similar to that of drosophila hsp <dig>  this split arrangement reduces cooperative binding of hsf trimers, leading to lower basal expression and higher inducibility than in the more contiguous motif  <cit> . the presence of two differentially regulated paralogues may reflect novel functionalization in hsp <dig> to provide both basal and inducible hsp expression. foraging bees are known to super-heat thoracic muscles prior and during flight, which necessitates both constitutive and inducible chaperoning activity  <cit> . transcriptomic screens in apis mellifera have found weak support for hsp <dig> up-regulation in foraging relative to nurse bees, but more detailed and precise quantification of each paralogue will determine whether they have subfunctionalized into constitutive and inducible roles  <cit> . in contrast, except for the nuptial flight of males and queens, worker ants are flightless, which may explain the secondary loss of the ancestral paralogue but the retention of the more inducible form.

in contrast to hsc <dig> and hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> was much more conserved. there was a single gene copy per taxon in which most sites were under purifying selection, suggesting that their co-chaperoning activity has been retained across insects. in particular, the conserved j domain of hsp <dig> stimulates the atpase domain of hsp <dig> proteins. across the insect hsp <dig> phylogeny, hse configuration remained conserved for all but d. melanogaster, whose primary motif was further from the transcriptional start site . although the hsp <dig> gene family is one of the most diverse molecular chaperones, we captured the paralogue that participates in the hsr because it was significantly up-regulated in response to heat stress. interestingly, hsp <dig> in p. barbatus peaked in up-regulation at a less extreme temperature than did the other hsp proteins . early expression of hsp <dig> may enhance chaperoning activity by binding to existing and accumulating pools of hsc <dig> and also by providing crosstalk with hsp90-mediated chaperoning  <cit> .

comparisons of two ant species that experience very different thermal ranges revealed correlated shifts in both the basal expression and inducibility of hsps that reflect the higher and more frequent thermal stress expected in extreme habitats . workers of the harvester ant p. barbatus forage in extreme desert heat  <cit>  and may be more reliant on both constitutive and inducible mechanisms to cope with thermal stress than workers of a. picea, which are more temperature sensitive and occur in thermally buffered mesic deciduous forest  <cit> . the gene expression responses of p. barbatus and a. picea are consistent with previous work comparing two hot-desert ant species of cataglyphis with the cool woodland ant formica polyctena  <cit> . in that study, hsp <dig>  basal expression and induction were higher in cataglyphis, although alternative paralogues were not fully distinguished. although hsp chaperoning activity expends energy , there may not be trade-offs between continual and maximum induction of hsps because investment in the hsr is less costly than the loss of biochemical activity from protein denaturation  <cit> . in addition, the hsr in p. barbatus in this study was shifted upward by ~5–7 °c , suggesting underlying differences in overall proteome stability that permit p. barbatus to tolerate significantly higher temperatures than a. picea .

CONCLUSIONS
our study represents the most comprehensive survey to date of hsp sequence and cis-regulatory evolution for insects. hymenoptera have unique hsp evolutionary histories shaped by gains, losses, and changes in cis-regulation. based on the presence of conserved cis-regulatory elements , we reliably predicted the heat inducible hsps that are critical for mounting the hsr in ants, suggesting that the ancestral inducibility has been retained. we uncovered greater diversity in the number, arrangement, and location of cis-regulatory hses in hymenoptera for two major hsp genes , suggesting that the hsr is mediated through changes in cis-regulation. furthermore, hsp expression patterns were associated with the thermal limits of two ant species that inhabit different thermal environments. collectively, our analyses suggest hsp sequence and expression patterns may reflect the forces of selection acting on thermal tolerance in ants and other social hymenoptera.
