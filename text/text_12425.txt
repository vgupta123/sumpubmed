BACKGROUND
the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease  is due, at least in part, to the formation in brain of insoluble protein deposits known as amyloid plaques. the principal component of the plaques, a neurotoxic, self-aggregating peptide known as amyloid β , is generated by successive cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein  by β- and γ-secretases. alternatively, app may be cleaved within its aβ domain by α-secretases, precluding the formation of aβ, and releasing sappα, a large soluble n-terminal fragment, from the cell surface. an alteration in the balance between these alternative proteolytic pathways may underlie the pathogenic process in ad  <cit> . recent research has identified the adam  family of zinc metalloproteases, particularly adam <dig> and adam17/tace , as α-secretases  <cit> . adams cleave a variety of transmembrane proteins, including app, within their extracellular domains, resulting in shedding of the ectodomain fragment  <cit> . multiple receptor ligands, as well as direct activators of protein kinase c , stimulate ectodomain shedding of app and other proteins  <cit> . however, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of app does not appear to be necessary for signal-regulated shedding of app  <cit> . neither does truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of adam <dig> prevent upregulation of its activity toward several of its substrates, including tumor necrosis factor α, by phorbol ester  <cit> . on the other hand, signal-activated shedding of trka and the prion protein was reported to be at least partially dependent on phosphorylation of threonine  <dig> within the cytoplasmic domain of adam17/tace by mitogen-activated protein kinase  <cit> . taken together, the evidence suggests that multiple mechanisms contribute to signal-mediated upregulation of ectodomain shedding by adams.

mutation of internalization motifs within the c-terminus of app, or removal of the c-terminal tail, increases surface expression of app, and release of sappα  <cit> . blocking the function of the endocytic protein dynamin by transfecting cells with dyn i k44a, a dominant-negative dynamin i mutant  <cit> , exerts similar effects  <cit>  suggesting that inhibition of endocytosis promotes ectodomain shedding by prolonging the interaction between app and α-secretases on the plasma membrane. because pkc phosphorylates dynamin, preventing it from associating with membrane phospholipids  <cit> , we hypothesized that inhibition of dynamin function might be the mechanism underlying kinase-dependent sappα release. however, the pkc activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  did not affect the rate of app internalization in hek cells stably transfected with app <dig>  <cit> .

it was recently reported that adam <dig> is cleaved within its ectodomain by adam <dig> or adam <dig>  generating a c-terminal fragment  that is then proteolyzed by γ-secretase  <cit> . the released intracellular domain subsequently translocates to the nucleus  <cit> . thus, like app, adam <dig> undergoes sequential two-step proteolysis to generate a fragment with potential signaling capabilities. our results show that inhibition of dynamin-dependent endocytosis increases surface expression of mature adam <dig>  and potentiates the formation of the adam <dig> ctf. activation of pkc, or m <dig> muscarinic receptors, did not affect adam <dig> surface expression or ctf formation, suggesting that receptor- or pkc-mediated stimulation of app shedding in these cells is not dependent on alterations in adam <dig> trafficking or proteolysis. other physiological mechanisms that could regulate adam <dig> internalization, such as interactions with other cell surface proteins, have the potential to alter generation of the ctf, thereby modulating its putative signaling actions.

RESULTS
inhibition of dynamin function increases surface expression of adam10
inhibition of dynamin-dependent internalization of app promotes its cleavage at the cell surface by α-secretases  <cit> . to determine if dynamin also regulates internalization of adam <dig>  hek-m <dig> cells were transiently transfected with adam <dig> and either dyn i k44a or an empty vector. after  <dig> h, cells were surface-biotinylated, lysed, and analyzed by western blotting. in vector-transfected cells, biotinylated endogenous adam <dig> appeared as one band, corresponding to the mature form, which lacks the inhibitory prodomain . the latter is removed by the action of proprotein convertases to generate the mature active form  <cit> . overexpression of adam <dig> increased surface levels of mature adam <dig>  and a second faint band representing the immature pro-form was also detected . in cells co-expressing adam <dig> and dyn i k44a, surface levels of both mature and immature adam <dig> were significantly increased compared to adam10/vector-transfected cells . mature adam <dig> at the cell surface was greatly enriched relative to the immature form of the protein; the reverse of the pattern observed in cell lysates . interestingly, immature adam <dig> on the cell surface accumulated in the presence of the dynamin mutant to a greater degree than the mature form . although only cells overexpressing adam <dig> displayed the immature form on the cell surface, the results suggest that both mature and immature adam <dig> are internalized in a dynamin-dependent fashion.

to confirm the identity of the anti-adam10-immunoreactive bands observed in surface-biotinylated isolates, cells co-transfected with adam <dig> and either app <dig> or empty vector, were treated with a competitive inhibitor of proprotein convertases, decanoyl-arg-val-lys-arg-chloromethylketone   <cit> , or dmso. in cells transfected with adam <dig>  the inhibitor increased levels of the immature form of adam <dig> on the cell surface, and in cell lysates . the release of both endogenous sappα, and co-transfected sappα <dig>  was concomitantly reduced in the presence of the inhibitor . this is consistent with a reduction in mature active adam <dig>  and with inhibition of endogenous adams, including tace, by dec-rvkr-cmk, and is in agreement with previously published reports  <cit> .

adam <dig> overexpression increases constitutive, but not m <dig> receptor-evoked release of sappα
in view of evidence that adam <dig> is preferentially activated by agents that increase calcium influx  <cit> , we examined the effect of the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol on adam <dig> surface expression and α-secretase function. previous work from this laboratory showed that a calcium ionophore stimulates sappα release from hek-m <dig> cells, and that carbachol-mediated sappα release from these cells is partially dependent on calcium  <cit> . in hek-m <dig> cells transiently transfected with app <dig>  co-expression of adam <dig> increased basal sappα release, while causing no further change in carbachol-evoked release, and sharply reduced surface levels of app . conversely, co-expression with app <dig> increased surface expression of immature adam <dig>  while leaving levels of mature adam <dig> unchanged . carbachol had no effect on surface expression of adam <dig> , and, despite the ability of pkc to regulate endocytosis of multiple cell surface proteins  <cit> , pma was similarly ineffective . overall, these results support a role for adam <dig> as a regulator of constitutive sappα shedding, but suggest that neither stimulation of m <dig> receptors, nor direct activation of pkc, affect surface expression of adam <dig> in this cell line.

proteolytic processing of adam <dig> is increased by dynamin inhibition, but is unaffected by carbachol
it has been reported that adam <dig> is cleaved within its ectodomain by adam <dig> or adam <dig>  generating a ctf that is subsequently proteolyzed by γ-secretase  <cit> . in agreement with this study, a fragment of approximately  <dig> kda was observed in cell lysates derived from hek-m <dig> cells transfected with adam <dig> and probed with antibodies to the adam <dig> c-terminus . levels of the ctf were increased several fold in cells co-transfected with dyn i k44a. the γ-secretase inhibitor l- <dig>  significantly increased the abundance of this fragment in co-transfected cells. the inhibitor also tended to increase ctf levels in adam10/vector transfectants, although the effect was not statistically significant . a smaller, ~ <dig> kda fragment was observed in adam10/dyn i k44a co-transfectants, but was much less abundant, and appeared to be unaffected by the inhibitor . although we were unable to detect adam <dig> immunoreactivity in the medium of adam10/dyn i k44a co-transfectants after a  <dig> h collection period, using the method described by tousseyn et al.  <cit> , the increased abundance of the adam <dig> ctf in lysates from cells co-transfected with dyn i k44a suggests that, like app  <cit> , adam <dig> proteolysis at the cell surface is increased when its internalization is inhibited. although shedding of the adam <dig> ectodomain was reported to be increased by phorbol ester in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells  <cit> , treatment of hek-m <dig> cells with carbachol had no effect on the generation of the adam <dig> ctf, either in the presence or absence of dyn i k44a . under identical conditions, this concentration of carbachol, which also activates pkc in these cells  <cit> , strongly increased app shedding .

dynamin inhibition does not alter the distribution of adam <dig> in raft and non-raft compartments
a subset of cellular app is located within cholesterol-rich subdomains of the plasma membrane known as lipid rafts, where it is subject to proteolysis by β- and γ-secretases  <cit> . in contrast, the α-secretase adam <dig> is largely excluded from lipid rafts  <cit> . the distribution of app and its secretases in different membrane domains could therefore affect the balance between amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing pathways. to determine if inhibition of adam <dig> internalization affected its distribution between raft and non-raft membrane regions, we employed a modified extraction procedure utilizing triton x- <dig>  <cit>  to isolate detergent-soluble and insoluble membrane fractions from cells expressing adam <dig> and an empty vector, or dyn i k44a. equal amounts of protein from each fraction were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the adam <dig> c-terminus . full-length mature and immature adam <dig> and its ctf were detected in both detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions . by expressing total protein levels in the detergent-soluble fraction as a fraction of the combined protein levels in both fractions, it was determined that approximately 90% of mature full-length adam <dig> and its ctf localized to the detergent-soluble non-raft compartment . although co-expression of dynamin i k44a increased levels of adam <dig> and its ctf in both fractions, their distribution between raft and non-raft domains was unaffected . the separation of raft and non-raft domains in this experiment was indicated by the differential distribution of the transferrin receptor  and flotillin- <dig> in the two fractions. approximately 97% of total tfr was localized in the detergent-soluble fraction, consistent with its designation as a non-raft marker. flotillin is used as a marker for lipid rafts, but its relative distribution is very sensitive to the detergent used for raft isolation  <cit> . in our hands, 36% of total flotillin- <dig> was found in the detergent-insoluble fraction in adam <dig> transfectants, and 23% in adam10/dynamin k44a co-transfectants . the degree of enrichment that we observed lies within the range reported by others using triton x- <dig> extraction and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation procedures  <cit> .

dynamin regulates n-cadherin proteolysis
these results, and earlier work from our laboratory and others, indicate that dynamin regulates internalization and proteolytic processing of both adam <dig> and its substrate app  <cit> . to extend this investigation to other transmembrane proteins, we examined the effect of the dynamin mutant on proteolytic processing of n-cadherin, an adhesion protein that is a substrate for adam <dig> and γ-secretase  <cit> . hek-m <dig> cells were transiently transfected with human n-cadherin and either empty vector, or dyn i k44a, separated into detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. the abundance of a ~ <dig> kda ctf of n-cadherin, a fragment previously shown to be a product of adam-mediated proteolysis  <cit> , was increased in cells co-expressing dyn i k44a. the increase was more prominent in the non-raft compartment . these results suggest that, as shown for app and adam <dig>  inhibition of dynamin function increases adam-mediated cleavage of n-cadherin, thereby promoting formation of a ctf. in the case of n-cadherin, increasing its proteolysis may potentiate its ability to act as a repressor of the transcriptional coactivator cbp   <cit> .

discussion
cleavage of app by the α-secretases, adam <dig> and adam17/tace, is of physiological importance because it precludes the formation of the toxic aβ peptide. moreover, the secreted app ectodomain fragment, sappα, promotes neural plasticity and neurogenesis, and exhibits neuroprotective properties  <cit> . g-protein coupled receptors, and compounds such as phorbol esters that directly activate pkc, increase cleavage of sappα by α-secretases, but the mechanism is not fully understood  <cit> . in the present study, we examined the effect of inhibiting dynamin-dependent endocytosis on the activity of adam <dig> toward its substrate app.

although other adams, notably adam <dig>  are capable of cleaving app, the expression of app in adult mouse brain overlaps to a much greater extent with adam <dig> than with adam <dig>  <cit> . moreover, app shedding is nearly abolished in primary neurons from mice null for adam <dig>  <cit> , and in cell lines following knockdown of adam <dig>  <cit> , indicating that adam <dig> is the physiologically relevant α-secretase in brain. co-expression of adam <dig> with a dominant-negative dynamin mutant, dyn i k44a, increased surface expression of both mature and immature forms, indicating that endocytosis of adam <dig>  like that of app  <cit>  is dynamin-dependent. an earlier report showed that endocytosis of membrane-type matrix metalloprotease  <dig>  is inhibited by a dynamin k44a mutant, resulting in increased cleavage of its substrate pro-mmp <dig>  <cit> . thus, modulation of internalization could be a general mechanism regulating the activity of transmembrane metalloproteases toward their substrates.

several laboratories have examined the effects of kinase activation on adam trafficking and protease activity. pma caused down-regulation of adam17/tace surface expression in jurkat and thp- <dig> cells  <cit> , and a transient increase followed by a decline in hela cells. the latter response was blocked by an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and by mutation of threonine  <dig> to alanine of adam17/tace  <cit> . pma also increased degradation of the mature processed form of adam17/tace, but not adam <dig>  in hek <dig> cells  <cit> , and promoted the translocation of adam <dig> to the cell membrane in glioblastoma cells  <cit> . taken together, the evidence indicates that pkc-regulated activation of adam <dig>  or adam17/tace, may be associated with alterations in trafficking in some cell types; however, neither pma nor m <dig> receptor activation appear to regulate cell-surface expression of adam <dig> in hek cells . thus, the ability of these activators to promote app ectodomain shedding in our model is not mediated by inhibition of internalization of either adam <dig>  or its substrate app  <cit> .

overexpression of adam <dig> increased constitutive, but not carbachol-evoked release of app <dig> from hek-m <dig> cells . even in the absence of carbachol, surface app <dig> was greatly reduced in adam10/app <dig> co-transfectants , suggesting that under these conditions the response to carbachol is limited by the availability of app <dig>  this interpretation is supported by an earlier report, which showed that adam <dig> overexpression caused a much greater fold-increase in basal than in pma-stimulated app shedding from hek cells, whereas a dominant negative adam <dig> mutant inhibited pma-stimulated app shedding by approximately 75%  <cit> . interestingly, surface levels of immature adam <dig>  but not mature adam <dig>  were increased in cells co-transfected with app <dig>  relative to levels in cells expressing adam <dig> and empty vector . this suggests that the association of app with adam <dig> inhibits the processing of adam <dig> by proprotein convertases, but how or where in the cell this occurs is unknown.

in addition to increasing surface expression of adam <dig>  the dynamin mutant caused a marked elevation in cellular levels of an adam <dig> ctf, the abundance of which was further increased by the γ-secretase inhibitor l- <dig>  . this is consistent with earlier reports that adam <dig> is subject to proteolysis by adam <dig> or  <dig>  generating a ctf that is a substrate for γ -secretase  <cit> , and suggests that the cleavage of adam <dig> occurs at the cell surface. as with surface expression of adam <dig>  generation of the adam <dig> ctf was not affected by carbachol , in contrast with an earlier report that pma increases adam <dig> shedding in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, but could be related to cell-specific differences, which also appear to underlie the varying effects of pkc activators on adam <dig> trafficking. because of the potential signaling role of the adam <dig> ctf  <cit>  it would be of interest to identify factors that regulate generation of this fragment. one possible mechanism could involve alterations in adam <dig> endocytosis resulting from direct interactions with other cell surface proteins. an example of such a mechanism is the modulation of app internalization and processing by members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein  family  <cit> . notably, binding to lrp1b retains app at the cell surface, increasing its cleavage by α-secretase, and reducing aβ generation  <cit> . similarly, f-spondin, a secreted signaling molecule implicated in neuronal development and repair  <cit> , binds to both the app ectodomain and the apolipoprotein receptor apoe <dig>  promoting sappα release, and inhibiting cleavage by β-secretase  <cit> ; both these effects are consistent with reduced internalization. we predict that binding partners of adam <dig> could affect its processing in a similar way.

evidence from multiple laboratories indicates that amyloidogenic app processing occurs in lipid rafts, whereas processing by adams is confined to non-raft regions  <cit> . disruption of raft domains by depleting membrane cholesterol shifts app processing in favor of non-amyloidogenic processing. this could reflect the displacement of app from raft domains, and away from β- and γ-secretases  <cit> , but might also be due in part to inhibition of endocytosis  <cit> . although dynamin i k44a expression increased surface levels and ectodomain cleavage of mature adam <dig>  there was no accompanying change in the partitioning of either full-length adam <dig> or its ctf in raft and non-raft domains . thus, the effects of the dynamin mutant on adam proteolysis are likely simply to reflect the accumulation of adam <dig>  and possibly of the adam that targets it, at the cell surface. to our knowledge, the effect of dynamin inhibition on the distribution of app in membrane subdomains has not been addressed. however, like adam <dig> itself, the adam <dig> substrate n-cadherin underwent increased proteolysis in the presence of dyn i k44a, without altering its distribution between triton-soluble and insoluble membrane domains .

adam <dig> has numerous substrates  <cit> , and alterations in its trafficking to or from the cell surface could affect its activity towards any or all of them, thereby regulating their biological activity. in the case of app and n-cadherin, this could inhibit their ability to promote cell-cell adhesion, neuronal development and synaptogenesis  <cit> , but at the same time would increase the signaling functions of their liberated c-terminal fragments  <cit> . increased generation of the adam <dig> ctf, also a consequence of decreased internalization, might exert biological effects of its own  <cit> , but these remain to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that the α-secretase adam <dig> is internalized by a dynamin-dependent mechanism. inhibition of endocytosis by co-expression of a dominant negative dynamin mutant increased surface expression of adam <dig>  and promoted its proteolysis, generating a prominent ctf. neither surface expression nor proteolysis of adam <dig> was affected by activation of muscarinic m <dig> receptors, despite the ability of this pkc-coupled signaling pathway to robustly stimulate app shedding. inhibition of dynamin also promoted cleavage of the adam substrate n-cadherin, but did not affect the membrane localization of either adam <dig> or n-cadherin, which were associated predominantly with non-raft domains. it will be of interest to identify physiological factors that regulate adam <dig> internalization, as these have the potential to modulate cell-cell contacts mediated by adam substrates such as app and n-cadherin, and to influence the generation and signaling functions of the ctfs of both adam <dig> and its targets.
