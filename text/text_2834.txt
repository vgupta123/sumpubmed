BACKGROUND
glycosphingolipids  and related metabolites are found ubiquitously in eukaryotes and mediate key functions involving cell membranes, including immune responses, drug resistance, surface adhesion, neuroregeneration, differentiation, and apoptosis  <cit> . glycolipid transfer protein  is a soluble protein  that can selectively transfer gsls between membranes  <cit> . gltp has been implicated in the golgi-to-plasma membrane, nonvesicular trafficking of glucosylceramide, a key intermediate in the synthesis of higher gsls and in cellular drug resistance  <cit> . in order to bind glycolipid, gltp utilizes an all α-helix conformation, arranged in a two-layer 'sandwich motif' containing no intramolecular disulfides, to form a single glycolipid liganding site  <cit> . comparative structural analyses of gltp in various gsl-free and gsl-complexed forms, along with crystallographic b-factor distributions, suggest that a cleft-like gating mechanism, involving conformational changes to two interhelical loops and one α-helix, facilitates entry and exit of the lipid chains in the membrane-associated state. acquisition of glycolipid occurs via an adaptive recognition process involving a sugar headgroup recognition center that forms multiple hydrogen bonds and van der waals contacts to selectively anchor the sugar-amide moieties to amino acid side chains of the protein surface as well as a 'molded-to-fit', hydrophobic tunnel to accommodate the hydrocarbon chains of the ceramide moiety  <cit> .

the novel architecture of gltp markedly contrasts the conformational motifs of other lipid binding and transfer proteins which generally are dominated by β-sheet, i.e. β-grooves/concave cups and β-barrels, or helical bundles stabilized by multiple disulfide-bridges, i.e. saposin-folds. such proteins include sphingolipid activator proteins, cd <dig> proteins, ceramide transfer protein, phosphoglyceride transfer proteins, other start-related proteins, nonspecific lipid transfer proteins, fatty acid binding proteins, lipocalins, and plant lipid transfer proteins  <cit> . gltp also forms a membrane targeting motif that differs from those used by other important peripheral proteins, i.e., c <dig>  c <dig>  ph, fyve, and px domains. the unique structural aspects of the glycolipid binding pocket and the membrane interaction region of gltp establish the gltp-fold as the prototype of the gltp superfamily  <cit> . gltp domains recently have been identified in other proteins, such as the ubiquitously-expressed phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate p) adaptor protein- <dig>  which is involved in vesicular trafficking from the golgi to the cell surface and glucosylceramide transfer during gsl synthesis  <cit> . other gltp orthologs have been linked to the programmed cell response induced by stress in plants   <cit>  and as part of the self-nonself recognition and compatibility response during heterokaryon fusion in filamentous fungi   <cit> .

the present study provides the first characterization of genes encoding gltp. in humans, single-copy gltp genes were located to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  encoding highly homologous gltps . the gltp gene at locus 11p <dig>  exhibited several characteristic features of a potentially active retrogene, affording the opportunity to critically evaluate rt-pcr limitations for accurate determination of single-copy, pseudogene expression. assessment of transcriptional activity by rt-pcr required extensive controls to ensure accurate conclusions and was aided by determination of the methylation status of 5' utr cpg islands as well as by comparative phylogenetic/evolutionary analyses of human gltp genes with other vertebrate gltp genes. the organizational pattern of the transcribed human gltp gene  and the encoded gltp amino acid sequence were highly conserved among various therian mammals and other vertebrates. in contrast, orthologs of the human intronless gltp gene were found only in primates  and were not present in rodentia  carnivora , cetartiodactyla , or didelphimorphia , consistent with recent evolutionary development as a primate-specific, processed pseudogene.

RESULTS
organization of human gltp genes
to identify the human gene encoding gltp, the sequences of cdnas that we previously cloned from gltp mrna of human skin fibroblasts and glioma cells  were used in blast searches of the ncbi human genome. highly homologous genomic dna sequences were found at loci on two different chromosomes: 12q <dig>  of chromosome  <dig>  and 11p <dig>  of chromosome  <dig> . five separate sequences, interspersed at the 12q <dig>  locus, were identical with five segments comprising the full-length gltp cdna orf , suggesting the presence of a gltp gene with five exons separated by four introns . when adjoined in 5'-to-3' fashion, the five exons encoded the same  <dig> amino acid sequence that we previously determined for human gltp by rt-pcr using purified mrna  <cit> . the first intron was substantially larger  than the other three introns . all exon/intron boundaries were characterized by classic consensus nucleotide sequences expected for splice sites, i.e. introns contained 5' gt and 3' ag dinucleotides as well as upstream pyrimidine tracts  <cit> . the 5'-3' arrangement of the five exons, the presence of classic intron dinucleotide sequences at all exon/intron junctions, and the 100% homology of the five exons at the 12q <dig>  locus with the full-length orf in gltp mrna were consistent with transcript maturation by cis splicing processes  <cit> .

alignment of the human cdna orfs  encoding gltp  also revealed ~94% homology with a single genomic dna sequence at locus 11p <dig>  in chromosome  <dig> . the genomic sequence  contained both start  and stop  codons and encoded a near full-length gltp-like protein  lacking only lys <dig> . absent from the gltp-like sequence was aga from within the cag435aagatc ttc <dig> region, affecting two potential codons . fortuitously, the deleterious effect of the missing aga was minimized and resulted only in the loss of a single lysine residue. the remaining cag435atc ttc <dig> sequence kept the reading frame fidelity in tact without alteration of subsequent codons. altogether, nucleotide deletions and substitutions delineated a total of  <dig> different amino acids in the gltp paralog, resulting in 94% identity with gltp encoded at locus 12q <dig>  .

comparison of the encoded sequences for human gltp and the gltp paralog  revealed the presence of all residues previously shown to be important components of the glycolipid liganding site, encompassing both the glycolipid recognition center  and the hydrophobic tunnel   <cit> . the 94% overall homology of the gltp paralog for human gltp was similar to that of mouse gltp and was much greater than that of het-c <dig> fungal gltp ortholog, which actively transfer glycolipids  <cit> . thus, the evidence suggested that the intronless gltp gene  at locus 11p <dig>  might be a retrogene with the potential to express active protein.

transcriptional status of human gltp genes
to determine whether the ncbi human expressed sequence tag  database contained any evidence for mrna transcript of the 11p <dig>  gltp paralog, blast searches were performed against both the gltpi orf at 11p <dig>  and the 5-exon/4-intron gltp orf at 12q <dig> . more than  <dig> sequences matched positively to human 5-exon/4-intron gltp orf, indicating active transcription for the gltp gene at locus 12q <dig>  in a variety of cells. however, one est clone  derived from pooled chondrosarcoma tumor cells matched identically with the gltpi orf at locus 11p <dig> , with its nearly full-length orf  including start  and stop  codons. thus, the possibility remained that gltpi at 11p <dig>  could be an active retrogene, expressed only at certain times during cell development or only in select cell types  <cit> . to directly assess the transcriptional status of both gltp genes in vivo, rt-pcr analyses were performed on the total rna isolates from various human cells. to circumvent the difficult task of identifying primers and pcr cycling conditions that could reliably and unequivocally discriminate between the highly homologous orfs predicted from the two gltp genes, pcr reactions were performed with 'gltp universal primers' designed to amplify equally well either  <dig> or  <dig> base sequences of either gltp orf . this strategy had the benefit of providing a pcr response expected to directly correlate with the relative abundance of the two potential gltp transcripts, irrespective of chromosomal origin. careful optimization of pcr cycling conditions avoided caveats associated with high cycling pcr, which can amplify the slightest traces of genomic dna present in rna isolates and lead to erroneous conclusions. controls using only platinum taq dna polymerase without reverse transcriptase  established the critical number of pcr cycles in our experiments to be 35– <dig> to maximize detection of potential gltp transcripts from the single-copy genes while avoiding spurious contributions from amplified genomic dna of gltpi remaining in the dnase-treated transcript isolates.

methylation status of cpg islands in human gltp genes
cpg dinucleotides in the 5' end regions of transcriptionally active chromosomal alleles generally are unmethylated. conversely, methylation of cpg islands is a known indicator of transcriptional silencing  <cit> . in human gltpi, a  <dig> base sequence including the 5' utr  and initial portion  of the potential orf , met the criteria of a cpg island  <cit> . to assess methylation status, human blood genomic dna was treated with bisulfite to convert unmethylated cytosines to uracils while leaving any methylated cytosines unaltered. primers containing no cpg dinucleotides were used for pcr to avoid bias between dna templates based on their original methylation status  <cit> . the results obtained by sequencing, after clonal amplification using pgem-t, are shown in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> cpg dinucleotides, localized in the cpg island of gltpi, were highly methylated in all clones , consistent with transcriptional silencing.

in the 5-exon/4-intron gltp gene, the cpg island  included a larger 5' utr region  along with all of the exon  <dig> orf  and the initial  <dig> bases of intron  <dig> . consistent with designation as a cpg island was the very high g-c content , that reached 80% and 84% in the 5'utr regions - <dig> and - <dig> from the translation initiation site, respectively. the very high concentration of cpg dinucleotides  in the cpg island severely limited the locations where 'cpg-free' primers, having the required 20– <dig> base sequence length, could be used to obtain the desired pcr products   <cit> . the criteria were met by a  <dig> base sequence containing  <dig> cpg sites in the 5'utr  of the 5-exon/4-intron gltp gene. bisulfite treatment followed by sequencing of clones showed all  <dig> cpg sites to be completely unmethylated , consistent with active transcription of the 5-exon/4-intron gltp gene.

to confirm the sequencing data for human blood cell genomic dna and further analyze the methylation status of the cpg island of gltpi in various other human cells, combined bisulfite-restriction analysis  was performed . figures 4b and 4c show the cobra data obtained for the gltpi cpg island. figure 4b shows the pcr products after bisulfite treatment of human blood cell genomic dna before  and after  bstui restriction digestion, which cuts only when two adjoining cpg dinucleotides within the recognition site are methylated . figure 4c shows results obtained with glioma , skin fibroblasts , breast cancer , caov <dig> ovarian cancer , imr- <dig> neuroblastoma  and gaucher cells . although traces of undigested amplified products were detected , nearly all amplified pcr products from gltpi cpg islands were cut by bstui, consistent with high level methylation and with transcriptional silencing.

glycolipid transfer activity of human gltp homologs
as pointed out earlier, comparison of human 5-exon/4-intron gltp with gltpi revealed encoding of all amino acid residues known to be important components of the glycolipid liganding site, including the glycolipid recognition center  and the hydrophobic tunnel   <cit> . to directly test whether gltpi could be a source of active protein in human cells, the two gltp homologs were heterologously expressed in e. coli, purified from the soluble fractions, and analyzed for their ability to transfer glycolipid between phospholipid bilayer vesicles in vitro. two findings were noteworthy. first, compared to 5-exon/4-intron gltp, the solubility of the gltpi paralog was very poor, as indicated by its high accumulation in the inclusion bodies of e. coli , consistent with a tendency to misfold. second, gltpi paralog purified from the soluble fraction showed negligible activity compared to purified 5-exon/4-intron gltp  when assessed for glycolipid intermembrane transfer using the well-established radiolabeled and fluorescence energy transfer assays  <cit> . inclusion of triton x- <dig> at low concentration during protein expression did result in slightly increased distribution of gltpi paralog to e. coli soluble fractions. nonetheless, the resulting gltpi paralog  remained inactive .

to determine whether a mammalian cellular environment is needed for expression of active gltpi paralog, human embryonic kidney cells  were transfected with flag-cmv vector containing the gltpi and gltp orfs. analysis of the resulting cell supernatant fractions revealed a 20-fold increase in glycolipid intermembrane transfer activity above endogenous background levels for cells transfected with gltp, but no increase in glycolipid intermembrane transfer activity for cells transfected with gltpi .

evolutionary insights
athe percent identity is compared to the human protein sequence. bnot yet determined.

in certain cases, sequence data for gltp genes was found to be either missing or of very low reliability. this situation was evident for the predicted gltp gene of pan troglodytes , based on careful comparisons to the human and macaque genes. to rectify the issue, the problematic g-c rich region of the chimp gltp gene  was cloned and sequenced using genomic dna from chimpanzee fibroblasts  by including pcr enhancers known to facilitate cloning of gltp mrna  <cit> . the resulting sequence of exon  <dig> in the chimp gltp gene was found to be identical to that of the human 5-exon/4-intron gltp gene . molecular cloning of the gltp orf using mrna from chimp fibroblasts  confirmed the identical nature of the encoded chimp and human gltps .

alignment of the five gltp exons comprising the primate mrna orfs revealed very high conservation of nucleotide sequence . the human and chimp orfs were  <dig> % identical, i.e. 627/ <dig> bases, and the human and macaque orfs were  <dig> % identical, i.e. 614/ <dig> bases. all nucleotide differences were synonymous  <cit> , i.e. no altered codon translation and all three primate gltps were identical in amino acid sequence . in nonprimate mammals, the gltp orfs had more nonsynonymous base substitutions , resulting in increased amino acid variability . even so, high amino acid sequence homology was encoded in the 5-exon/4-intron gltp genes of nonprimate mammals with sequence identity being 99% for canis,  <dig> % for bos,  <dig> % for mus, and  <dig> % for monodelphis as well as for other vertebrates  compared to human 5-exon/4-intron gltp.

phylogenetic analyses  indicated that all sequences produced exactly the same tree topology by three independent methods   <cit> . most of the major internal branches were well supported . overall, the phylogenetic/evolutionary relationships observed for the 5-exon/4-intron gltp gene conformed to the widely-accepted phylogeny of vertebrates. the situation for gltpi was much different. orthologs of the human gltpi gene were discovered only in nonhuman primates  and were not present in carnivora , cetartiodactyla , rodentia  or didelphimorphia , suggesting recent evolutionary development. the 'intronless' nature of the orf sequences was consistent with origination by retrotransposition of mrna derived from an ancestral 5-exon/4-intron gltp gene. the structural features supporting the common evolutionary ancestry of gltpi genes in primates, included the following differences compared to their 5-exon/4-intron gltp genes: 1) location on a different chromosome; 2) occurrence of nearly full-length gltp orfs  including both start and stop codons; 3) absence of aga at the same location in the sequence; 4) presence of the cag435atc ttc <dig> sequence , keeping the potential reading frame fidelity intact and limiting downstream changes. the locations of the base changes within the affected gltpi sequences are shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  these shared and delineating features provided an unequivocal indication of the close evolutionary relationship among the gltpi genes of primates.

estimates of the evolutionary divergence for the 5-exon/4-intron and gltpi genes of primates and other primates provided insights into the selection pressure exerted on different phylogenetic branches. as shown in table  <dig>  base substitutions resulting in no change in amino acid residue  per synonymous site are compared with the nucleotide changes that do result in an amino acid alteration per nonsynonymous site   <cit> . ka/ks ratios indicate the rate of evolution  <cit> . in table  <dig>  the higher ka/ks ratios for 5-exon/4-intron gltp genes among rodents compared to those among primates and cetartiodactylates are consistent with the rate of 5-exon/4-intron gltp protein evolution being faster in rodents than in primates and cetartiodactyla, after scaling to neutral divergence. nonetheless, very low values for the ka/ks ratios, i.e. zero and <  <dig>  for the exons of the 5-exon/4-intron gltp genes in primates  and cetartiodactyla  and of mus musculus and rattus norvegicus, are consistent with strong selection pressure to maintain and conserve the encoded amino acid sequence, as expected for genes playing important functional roles. in contrast, the gltpi genes of homo sapiens, pan troglodytes, and macaca mulatta show significantly higher ka/ks values , consistent with no evolutionary selection pressure being exerted on the primate gltpi compared to their 5-exon/4-intron gltp genes, because ka/ks values slightly below  <dig>  are not de facto evidence of purifying selection pressure  <cit> .

agltp = functional 5-exon/4-intron gltp gene and gltpi = intronless gltp gene. hom, pan, mac, bos, sus, mus, rat and dan indicate homo sapiens, pan troglodytes, macaca mulatta, bos taurus, sus scrofa, mus musculus, rattus norvegicus and danio rerio, respectively. bnumber of base pairs compared. cthe relatively high ka/ks ratio of 5-exon/4-intron gltp genes between danio rerio gltp genes on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> suggests a functional change after duplication of one of the danio rerio gltp genes.

discussion
gltp has recently emerged as the prototypical and founding member of a new protein superfamily, characterized by a unique conformational fold for lipid binding/transfer as well as for protein targeting/translocation to membranes  <cit> . while recent advances have delineated the architecture used by gltp to selectively acquire glycosphingolipid ligand  <cit>  as well as the role played by membrane lipid composition in regulating gltp activity in vitro  <cit> , the organization, transcriptional status, phylogenetic/evolutionary relationships of human gltp genes have not been previously characterized.

our findings show the gltp gene to be present in all vertebrate genomes and characterized by a highly conserved 5-exon/4-intron organizational pattern, consistent with mrna production via classical cis processing events. the resulting gltp transcript encodes a highly conserved mammalian protein able to selectively bind glycolipids and accelerate their intermembrane transfer  <cit> . the human 5-exon/4-intron gltp gene maps to locus 12q <dig>  of chromosome  <dig> and is actively transcribed in variety of different cells, as shown by rt-pcr and by the unmethylated status of cpg dinucleotides in its cpg island. noteworthy features of the 5-exon/4-intron gltp gene are the very large size of its first intron  and the exceptionally high density of cpg dinucleotides  and of g-c bases  in its cpg island. the very high g-c content probably contributed to the poor sequence resolution evident in the gltp gene of the recent pan troglodytes  genome release , the resulting omission of exon  <dig> from the chimp gltp gene , and inaccurate predictions of mrna and protein sequence . our cloning and sequencing of the genomic dna of gltp exon  <dig> as well as full-length gltp orf from mrna of pan troglodytes fibroblasts  have rectified the earlier inconsistencies and demonstrated the existence of the highly conserved 5-exon/4-intron gltp gene in chimpanzee.

the discovery of a second, intronless gltp-like gene , encoding a full-length gltp paralog in humans provided the opportunity to test for functionality as a retrogene. the issue is of timely relevance because of recent reports indicating transcription and regulatory functions of intronless pseudogenes  <cit> . our analyses of gltpi, which maps to locus 11p <dig>  of chromosome  <dig>  provide a clear indication of the challenges associated with definitive validation of pseudogene transcription. the experiments illustrate how pcr amplification involving closely-related sequences can detect even the slightest traces of genomic dna contaminant in highly purified rna isolates . it is clear that stringent controls are needed when using pcr to analyze the transcriptional status of intronless genes, including pcr controls performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase , to avoid erroneous conclusions regarding the source of similarly sized templates . such controls are needed even with dnase-treated mrna isolates . in fact, it was possible to detect gltpi genomic dna in no-rt controls of mrna isolates treated three times in succession with dnase, when the pcr thermal cycling number reached  <dig> or higher . the pcr-associated caveats emphasize the need for independent analyses during evaluations of the transcriptional status of intronless genes that are highly homologous to the transcript of their parent genes. reliance on the est database as a complementary approach is risky because of documented evidence of substantial contamination from various sources including genomic dna  <cit> . in contrast, a dependable complementary approach for monitoring gene transcriptional status is analysis of the methylation status of cpg islands commonly found in the 5'utr of genes. the high methylation levels of the  <dig> cpg dinucleotides in the cpg island of the intronless gltp-like gene, along with the carefully controlled pcr data, provide strong evidence for this gene being a transcriptionally silent pseudogene. we find this to be the case despite the fact that gltpi encodes an almost full-length orf , complete with start and stop codons, and with an overall amino acid sequence homology of 94% compared to the active 5-exon/4-intron gltp. it is noteworthy that the 94% homology is similar to that of human 5-exon/4-intron gltp and mouse gltp and much greater than that of the het-c <dig> fungal ortholog  <cit>  which actively transfers glycolipid. also, heterologous expression of 5-exon/4-intron gltp cdna generated from human, bovine, porcine, and murine transcripts yields fully active protein in e. coli  <cit> , presumably because gltp lacks intramolecular disulfides  <cit>  and needs no posttranslational modifications, i.e. glycosylation or acylation  <cit> . nonetheless, the human gltpi paralog is inactive and poorly soluble when expressed in e. coli. ectopic expression in human embryonic kidney cells using flag-cmv vector also resulted in inactive gltpi. the absence of in vitro activity in the human gltpi paralog occurs despite the fact that contains all residues previously identified as important components of the glycolipid liganding site, including the glycolipid recognition center  and the hydrophobic tunnel   <cit> . our findings suggest that misfolding, triggered by one or more of the  <dig> altered residues, is responsible for the inactive state of human gltpi. identification of which of these gltp residues or combination of residues are essential for proper folding will require future in-depth analyses.

additional support for human gltpi gene being a transcriptionally silent pseudogene comes from phylogenetic/evolutionary divergence analyses that provide insights into the selection pressure being exerted on genes  <cit> . the frequencies of nonsynonymous  and synonymous  nucleotide substitutions for the gltp functional and intronless genes  are consistent with strong divergence of gltpi relative to the 5-exon/4-intron gltp genes. the relatively high ka/ks ratios  for gltpi of homo sapiens, pan troglodytes, and macaca mulatta indicate that they have been subjected to very low evolutionary selection pressure. it is important to recognize that ka/ks values slightly below  <dig>  are not de facto evidence of significant purifying selection pressure. indeed, a comprehensive genome-wide survey of human pseudogenes, performed against benchmark control sets of true genes and pseudogenes, revealed that only a small fraction  of pseudogenes have ka/ks values very close to the theoretical neutral selection pressure value of  <dig>   <cit> . rather, the majority of human pseudogenes have ka/ks values very similar to those of the primate gltpi pseudogenes. in contrast, the low ka/ks ratios for the 5-exon/4-intron gtlp genes  indicate strong purifying selection pressure to conserve the encoded amino acid sequence in order to maintain protein functionality.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides the first insights into the genomic organization, transcriptional status, and phylogenetic/evolutionary relationships of human gltp genes, which encode the prototypical member of the recently established gltp superfamily. the finding of a highly conserved 5-exon/4-intron gltp gene in vertebrates vouches for the importance of gltp in cells. also noteworthy was the discovery of many errors in the on-line bioinformatics databases pertaining to gltp genes, perpetuated by predictive modeling analyses that relied on low stringency survey data  rather than on carefully executed experiments. the novel finding of a transcriptionally-silent, intronless gltp gene in humans supports designation as gltpp <dig>  in accordance with guidelines for human gene nomenclature  <cit> . the discovery of gltpp <dig> orthologs in other primates provides a new 'selection pressure free' marker for tracking primate evolutionary relationships. clear delineation of the absence of transcription by human gltpp <dig> was evident only by application of comprehensive and stringent experimental criteria, thus highlighting the challenges of unequivocally distinguishing silenced pseudogenes from functional retrogenes. in a larger context, the present study supports concerns about the validity of recent functional roles assigned to intronless pseudogenes. among the most noteworthy is the recent re-evaluation of mkrn1-p <dig> pseudogene 'functionality'  <cit> , providing definitive evidence that the mkrn1-p <dig> pseudogene is neither expressed nor imprinted, nor does it regulate its source gene in trans, despite earlier high profile indications to the contrary  <cit> . equally important, the fundamental insights gained here into human gltp gene organization, transcriptional status, and evolution provide a firm foundation for future elucidation and understanding of hereditary defects involving gltp genes.
