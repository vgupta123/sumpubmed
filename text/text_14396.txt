BACKGROUND
tissue injury initiates complex inflammatory reactions known as the acute phase response in which the principal role is played by cytokines such as il- <dig>  tnf and il- <dig>  in the liver these cytokines, particularly il- <dig>  drastically alter the pattern of synthesized cellular and secreted proteins  <cit> . established cell lines of liver origin  represent a useful model for studying the regulation of liver-specific gene expression. in a recently published report  <cit>  we employed differential display analysis to monitor changes in the transcript profile of hepg <dig> cells stimulated with il- <dig>  il- <dig> and a mixture of both cytokines. we identified over  <dig> genes responding to these cytokines and encoding several proteins of known structure and function. additionally, we found some  <dig> cytokine-sensitive transcripts coding for unknown or poorly characterized proteins. one of those genes coding for a  <dig> kda polypeptide was selected for further detailed characterization.

during those studies we concluded that the analyzed sequence corresponds to a gene described recently by tsuneoka and co-workers  <cit>  and induced in various human tumor cells overexpressing c-myc. the protein product of this gene was named mimitin  since it was localized in mitochondria and contained an atp/gtp binding motif as well as a domain called complex1_17_ <dig> kda. these data strongly suggested that mimitin may be involved in atp metabolism in mitochondria. in agreement with the postulated regulatory role of c-myc in the expression of mimitin, a specific c-myc binding site was identified in the promoter region of mimitin gene. further analyses carried out by independent research groups  <cit>  suggest that mimitin plays the role of a molecular chaperone for the assembly of mitochondrial complex i.

in the present paper, we report that the mimitin gene is activated by the proinflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig>  and we describe the temporal pattern of cytokine response as well as identification of the signalling pathways involved. we also compare the abundance of mimitin transcript in different human tissues and analyze the significance of mimitin for cell proliferation and cell response to apoptotic signals.

RESULTS
cytokine-induced changes in the expression of mimitin gene
the mimitin transcript was initially detected by us  <cit>  by differential display analysis in hepg <dig> cells stimulated with il- <dig>  to study the importance of proinflammatory cytokines in mimitin gene expression hepg <dig> cells were stimulated with il- <dig>  il- <dig> or a mixture of both cytokines. changes in gene expression were evaluated at the transcript and protein levels . in northern blot analysis the densitometric values of bands corresponding to mimitin transcript were measured for control  cells and cells stimulated with il- <dig> or il- <dig>  in case of cytokine mixture, cells were prestimulated with il- <dig> and then stimulated with il- <dig> to simulate the physiological cascade of events. in all cases exposure to cytokines led to an increase in mimitin mrna abundance. the highest transcript level observed after  <dig> h of stimulation with il- <dig> or il- <dig> exceeded control levels by  <dig>  and  <dig>  times, respectively . in the case of the two cytokines combined we observed  <dig> -fold up-regulation of mimitin mrna after 27/ <dig> h of cytokine exposure .

to evaluate changes in protein level polyclonal antisera of high titre were raised in rabbits against recombinant mimitin. the antibodies generated specifically recognized recombinant as well as endogenous mimitin in western blot analysis. for accurate serial measurements elisa tests were carried out and the obtained results compared with the northern blotting data. as shown in fig. 1b, a 2-fold increase of mimitin level occurs after  <dig> h of stimulation with il- <dig>  or after  <dig> h of stimulation with il- <dig>  a sustained increased level of mimitin is still seen after  <dig> h stimulation with il- <dig> alone or with the il-1/il- <dig> mixture.

the obtained results indicate that stimulation of hepg <dig> cells with the mixture of cytokines leads to a more prolonged expression of the mimitin gene than stimulation with a single cytokine, the effect being manifested at the levels of both mrna and protein.

induction of mimitin by il- <dig> involves map kinases but not the nfκb pathway
to investigate the role of nfκb signalling pathway in activation of mimitin gene by il- <dig> we used a cell line stably transfected with retroviral vector pcfg5-ieg <dig> encoding a non-degradable mutant of the inhibitor of nfκb . cells stably transfected with the empty vector served as a control. the control and miκbα-expressing cells were stimulated with il- <dig> for  <dig> h. to monitor the level of mimitin transcript northern blot analysis was carried out. as shown in fig. 2a and 2b, the level of mimitin transcript in hepg <dig> cells expressing miκbα and stimulated with il- <dig> is the same as it is in case of il- <dig> stimulated control. thus, the nfκb signalling pathway appears not to be involved in the expression of il-1-dependent activation of mimitin gene. it is known, however, that another signalling pathway important in the expression of il-1-regulated genes involves map kinases. to check if this pathway is engaged in mimitin regulation three potent, selective, pharmacological inhibitors of mapks cascade were used: u <dig> for erk, sp <dig> for jnk, zm <dig> for p <dig> the specificity of each inhibitor was verified by western blotting with antisera against phosphorylated forms of individual kinases , and a lack of cytotoxic effects was confirmed by the mtt assay . as shown in fig. 2c all these inhibitors abolished the il-1-induced elevation of mimitin mrna level, confirming the involvement of map kinases in the stimulation of mimitin gene expression by il- <dig> 

expression of mimitin in human tissues
a commercial blot with mrna isolated from a number of normal human cells, organs and tissues was used to estimate the pattern of mimitin expression at the mrna level. the probe corresponding to the whole coding sequence of mimitin gene recognized a single transcript of approximately  <dig> nt. among the tissues examined, the mimitin mrna level was the highest in the heart, with considerably lesser amounts found in the liver, skeletal muscles and kidney. only traces were detected in the other tissues investigated .

subcellular localization of mimitin
to determine the subcellular localization of mimitin the qproteome kit for cell compartment fractionation was used. protein extracts were isolated from hepg <dig> cells according to manufacturer's procedure, separated on polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by western blotting with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies specific for mimitin. commercial anti-laminin, anti-gapdh and anti-prohibitin polyclonal antibodies were used to detect markers of typical subcellular fractions. the analysis revealed that mimitin is co-localized with prohibitin in the membrane fraction . this fraction consists of plasma and organelle membranes . in order to determine the localization of mimitin in more detail the procedure of ndubuisi et al. was used to isolate the mitochondrial fraction  <cit> . analysis of this fraction confirmed mitochondrial association of mimitin , in full agreement with the data of tsuneoka et al.  <cit> .

identification of mimitin-binding proteins
the results of experiments described below suggested that mimitin, being a mitochondrial protein, might participate in various pathways of cellular metabolism and initiation of apoptosis. this participation could be indirect, via a partner protein. as the first step in the identification of mimitim partners we used yeast two-hybrid screening and the matchmaker human foetal brain cdna library. from  <dig> selected clones seven positive clones were isolated of which four encoded microtubule associated protein 1s , one encoded stathmin-like  <dig> protein and the remaining two had no similarity to any cdna in the ncbi database. map1s protein was chosen for further analysis because liu and co-workers  <cit>  showed that when map1s protein accumulates in cells, it appears to be localized on mitochondria and induces distinct perinuclear aggregates of mitochondria. moreover, it was shown that map1s interacts with mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenase i and cytochrome c oxidase i  <cit> .

we carried out a coimmunoprecipitation assay to investigate whether mimitin associates with map1s in vivo. vectors encoding myc-tagged map1s with its transactivator and mimitin were transfected separately or together into hepg <dig> cells. protein lysates were loaded on a column with antibodies for c-myc and specific eluates were then subjected to western blotting with either anti-mimitin or anti-myc antibodies. as shown in fig.  <dig>  signals for map1s are visible with c-myc antibodies in eluates prepared from hepg <dig> cells overexpressing only map1s-c-myc or map1s-c-myc with mimitin. a signal for mimitin is seen only for the eluate from hepg <dig> cells overexpressing both proteins . this indicates that mimitin does in fact form a complex with map1s in vivo which confirms the yeast two-hybrid data.

effects of mimitin level on cell viability
to investigate the role of mimitin on cell viability we analysed the influence of changes of mimitin gene expression on hepg <dig> cell proliferation and susceptibility to apoptosis. for effective knockdown of mimitin gene, hepg <dig> cells were transfected with two different sirnas  in two concentrations . as a positive control sirna specific for gapdh was used, whereas a sirna with a scrambled sequence served as a negative control. additional control  was obtained by treatment of cells with the transfection reagent siport™ neofx™ alone. the efficiency of knockdown was evaluated  <dig> h post transfection by measuring mimitin level by western blotting. we found that cell treatment with mimitin-a-specific sirna led to an almost complete disappearance of this protein from the cells, while sirna-mimitin-b only slightly reduced mimitin level . the silencing effect was specific, since there was no reduction of mimitin level in the cells treated with gapdh sirna, negative control sirna or transfection reagent alone. based on preliminary results, mimitin-a sirna at  <dig> nm was selected for further knockdown experiments.

the mimitin gene was silenced in hepg <dig> cells using the established parameters and then caspase  <dig> and  <dig> activities were assayed, since they are known to be involved in programmed cell death  <cit> . the knockdown of mimitin gene had no effect on caspase  <dig> and  <dig> activities. this indicated that the level of mimitin has no direct influence on the basic activities of these caspases; however, it could still modulate them once they had been induced by a pro-apoptotic signal. indeed, when we first induced apoptosis by treating the cells with tnf/chx and then determined these caspases we found a striking effect of mimitin. hepg <dig> cells treated with sirna specific for mimitin  showed approximately  <dig> fold increase in the activity of caspases in comparison to negative control . mimitin silencing was confirmed by western blot analysis . however, treatment of cells with a gapdh-specific sirna had an even stronger effect on caspase activities , although the protein level of gapdh was only slightly reduced . the effects of both transfections show statistically significant differences in comparison to the negative control, with p <  <dig>  for the mimitin-specific sirna and p <  <dig>  for gapdh specific sirna. the result obtained in hepg <dig> cells with the gapdh-specific sirna is not surprising because some reports indicate that silencing of the gene coding for gapdh in tumour cells decreases the rate of glycolysis, inhibits cell proliferation and eventually leads to apoptosis  <cit> .

we conclude that although mimitin has no direct influence on the basal activities of caspases 3/ <dig>  changes of its expression may profoundly affect these enzymes in the course of tnf/chx-induced apoptosis.

the importance of mimitin in regulation of caspase 3/ <dig> activities during apoptosis was confirmed by overexpression of mimitin in hepg <dig> cells treated with a mixture of tnf and chx. hepg <dig> cells transfected with the pcdna-mimitin vector and treated with tnf/chx showed a 2-fold decrease of caspase 3/ <dig> activity compared to control . this result is in a full agreement with the data obtained after knockdown of mimitin gene expression. silencing of mimitin gene in cells with induced apoptosis increases caspase 3/ <dig> activities, whereas its overexpression gives an opposite effect.

to exclude the possibility that the observed changes in cell viability are not caused by cytotoxic effects of tnf and chx, the release of ldh from the cells was measured. it was found that neither transfection of cells with different sirnas, nor tnf/chx treatment, lead to increased ldh release which is regarded as an indicator of cell death via necrosis . then the effect of the mimitin gene silencing on cell proliferation was determined by brdu-incorporation in hepg <dig> cells transfected with sirna targeting mimitin. as shown in fig.  <dig>  silencing with mimitin-a sirna resulted in a small but significant  decrease of brdu-incorporation compared to control cells. thus, we conclude that a reduced cellular level of mimitin slightly decreases the rate of dna replication and cell proliferation. on the other hand, overexpression of mimitin seemed to have no effect on hepg <dig> proliferation .

discussion
proinflammatory cytokines modulate expression of several mitochondrial proteins participating in atp generation, as it was shown in our previous studies  <cit> . cytokines such as il- <dig> and il- <dig> are known to influence energy metabolism and mitochondrial function  <cit> , significantly inhibiting atp production and utilization in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as it was shown in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes  <cit> . in our experiments we observed an increase in the levels of mimitin transcript and mimitin protein after  <dig> and  <dig> h of hepg <dig> cells exposure to il- <dig> and il- <dig>  these cytokines also stimulated expression of the luciferase reporter gene under control of the mimitin gene promoter . therefore, it can be concluded that both cytokines regulate mimitin gene expression at the transcriptional level.

it is puzzling why the proinflammatory cytokines activate expression of a gene coding for a mitochondrial protein. in an attempt of answering this question we looked for proteins interacting with mimitin. using yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation we found that one of the proteins interacting with mimitin is map1s. this is a recently described member of the microtubule-associated protein  <dig> family, expressed in a wide range of tissues and synthesized as a precursor protein that is cleaved into heavy and light chains in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> . liu and co-workers  <cit>  showed that map1s is complexed with mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenase i and cytochrome c oxidase i resulting in "mitochondrial aggregation and genome destruction"  <cit> . the results of liu and co-workers suggest that map1s mediates communication between the microtubular cytoskeleton and mitochondria, especially in control of cell death  <cit> .

taking into consideration that mimitin is a mitochondrial protein and that it probably functions as a molecular chaperone essential for the efficient assembly of complex i  <cit> , we expected that this protein could be important for cell viability. to investigate this hypothesis we studied the effect of either inhibition or overexpression of mimitin on cell proliferation, and cell survival. blocking the expression of mimitin in hepg <dig> cells by sirna demonstrated that mimitin itself has no direct influence on caspase 3/ <dig> activities. however, when apoptosis was induced with tnf and chx the activity of caspases was significantly increased by silencing mimitin expression. conversely, overexpression of mimitin in cells induced to undergo apoptosis reduced the activity of these caspases. moreover, inhibition of mimitin gene slightly decreased the proliferation rate of hepg <dig> cells, while mimitin overexpression apparently had no effect.

treatment of hepg <dig> cells with tnf/chx initiates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and strongly stimulates effector caspases  <cit> . since overexpression of mimitin leads to a significant decrease in the activites of caspases 3/ <dig> it is possible that potential antiapoptotic properties of mimitin become apparent after interaction with some pro-apoptotic proteins, such as the microtubular protein – map1s. further studies are required to elucidate the significance of these interactions and to establish the exact position of mimitin in cell death-related processes.

CONCLUSIONS
we confirmed that mimitin is a mitochondrial protein and showed that it is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines with a highest basal expression in the heart. mapk kinases, but not the nfκb-related pathway, were shown to play a pivotal role in il-1- dependent regulation of mimitin gene. mimitin was found to interact with the microtubular protein map1s and modulation of mimitin gene expression affected the activities of caspases  <dig> and  <dig> but only in the cells stimulated to develop apoptosis.
