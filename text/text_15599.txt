BACKGROUND
neospora caninum is an apicomplexan protozoan of the family sarcocystidae  <cit> . its definitive hosts are dogs   <cit> , coyotes   <cit> , dingoes   <cit> , and gray wolves   <cit> . neosporosis is considered the major cause of abortion in bovines worldwide and congenital infection is the main cause of its maintenance in herds  <cit> . many cases of reproductive problems associated with n. caninum in goats have been described  <cit> , but the birth of healthy and uninfected animals has also been reported  <cit> .

the main lesions found in tissue sections of the central nervous systems  of the aborted fetuses are multifocal necroses, glioses, and perivascular mononuclear cell cuffs, together with n. caninum itself  <cit> . similar lesions to those found in fetuses were observed in a sheep  <cit>  and cow  <cit>  diagnosed with neosporosis by the isolation of the parasite and pcr, respectively.

although many cases of neosporosis have been reported in ruminants, the inflammatory and glial cells within the cns lesions have not been characterized. therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the inflammatory response and the glial cells in the cns lesions in fetuses aborted by n. caninum infection and in healthy male goats naturally infected with the protozoan. this is the first report of n. caninum cysts in the cns of adult goats.

methods
the experiment was conducted in the laboratory of veterinary pathology at the federal university of lavras  in the state of minas gerais, brazil. the study was approved by the ethics committee for animal use at ufla, under protocol number 081/ <dig> 

animals
we selected  <dig> goats for this study from our institutional herd: six healthy adult males, aged from 6 months to 3 years, and eight aborted fetuses . the goats’ dams were naturally infected with n. caninum, identified by the detection of specific antibodies with an indirect fluorescent antibody test , and seronegative for toxoplasma gondii by ifat . the congenital infection of the adult male goats was confirmed by the detection of specific antibodies with ifat  in sera obtained from blood samples collected before the ingestion of colostrum and by the detection in the dams’ placentas of n. caninum dna with pcr and dna sequencing. the male goats were animals scheduled for disposal that had been kept in pens since birth to avoid exposure to sporulated n. caninum in the environment. all the male goats were seronegative for t. gondii by ifat. neospora caninum infection in the fetuses was confirmed with pcr and dna sequencing of their placentas and cns, with the methodology described by mesquita et al.  <cit> . four fetuses and one adult male that were seronegative for n. caninum and t. gondii according to pcr and ifat were used as the negative controls.

sample collection and processing
the fetuses were necropsied shortly after abortion, and the adult males after euthanasia under anesthesia with thiopental and a subsequent intravenous infusion of potassium chlorate solution. tissue samples from all the animals were collected in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. samples of heart, lung, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, brain , and spinal cord  were processed routinely for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. the lesions were classified as discrete, moderate, or severe. samples of the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum were also collected and stored at −20°c for pcr analysis.

immunohistochemistry
to evaluate the lesions and cellular immunological response in the cns, the following antibodies were used: anti-cd79α  for b lymphocytes; anti-cd <dig>  for t lymphocytes; anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein  for astrocytes; anti-g-h42a  for major histocompatibility complex ii  molecules; and anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen  for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, at dilutions of 1: <dig>  1: <dig>  1: <dig>  1: <dig>  and 1: <dig>  respectively. to confirm the presence of n. caninum in tissue slices, an anti-n. caninum antibody  was used. antigen retrieval for n. caninum and gfap was performed in citrate buffer , whereas tris–edta buffer was used for the other antibodies; all slices were irradiated for 6 min at full power in a domestic microwave. samples of normal cns, lymph nodes, tonsils, and tissues that contained n. caninum were used as the positive controls. as a negative control, the antibody was substituted with phosphate-buffered saline. additional brain sections from the infected animals were subjected to immunohistochemistry using an anti-t. gondii antibody .

immunolabeling was classified according to the number of stained cells in a single field at 400× magnification, as discrete , fewer than  <dig> stained cells per field; moderate , 10– <dig> stained cells per field; and severe ,more than  <dig> stained cells per field.

the immunolabeled cells in the lesions were morphologically characterized. immunolabeled astrocytes in the unaffected areas were not considered .table  <dig>

lectin histochemistry
biotinylated riccinus communis agglutinin , diluted 1: <dig> , was incubated with the cns samples overnight to identify the microglia and macrophages. the antigen was retrieved in citrate buffer  after irradiation of the samples for 6 min at full power in a domestic microwave.

molecular analysis
samples of cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum were collected and stored at −20°c until analysis. dna was extracted from them with a commercial kit  after lysis with proteinase k. to detect n. caninum, primers based on chromosome xii of n. caninum were used , as described by orlando et al.  <cit> , to amplify an expected fragment of 168 bp. the pcr products were resolved by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel at 100 v for 1 h. the amplicons of the positive samples and the positive control were quantified spectrophotometrically and sequenced with the dideoxy chain termination technique  <cit> .

RESULTS
tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the ages of the goats and the gestational stages at which abortion occurred, the occurrence and intensity of the histopathological lesions, the method of diagnosis of n. caninum infection, and the intensity of the cellular immunolabeling in the lesions. fetuses 1– <dig> were the products of a single gestation , as were fetuses  <dig> and  <dig>  and fetuses  <dig> and  <dig>  fetuses  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and the male goat  <dig>  which were all negative for n. caninum, were used as negative controls. goat  <dig> exhibited clinical neurological signs at birth, with moderate paresis, lack of coordination of the pelvic limbs, and difficulty in standing. these clinical signs had decreased a week after birth, and normal development proceeded until 12 months of age, when the animal was euthanized.

necropsy and histopathological findings
the goats exhibited no macroscopic lesions. the microscopic findings in the fetuses were discrete to moderate perivascular mononuclear cuffs , observed near the glioses. the glioses were focal or multifocal and were observed with decreasing frequency in the cerebral cortex , rostral colliculus , thalamus , caudal colliculus , medulla oblongata and obex  , cerebellar peduncles , pons, and the cervical and lumbar spinal cord . foci of necrosis surrounded by glial cells and inflammatory cells were also observed in fetus  <dig>  and fetus  <dig> . discrete mononuclear meningitis was observed close to the cerebral cortex in fetuses 4– <dig>  neospora caninum cysts were observed in the thalamus  and the cerebral cortex , close to areas of inflammation  or not . in fetus  <dig>  a parasitic cyst was seen in the neuronal cytoplasm. in fetuses  <dig> and  <dig>  there were rare foci of mineralization associated with necrosis.figure  <dig>

only two of the aborted fetuses showed lesions in the myocardium and skeletal striated muscle. these consisted of varying degrees of mononuclear inflammatory infiltration, and in one fetus, some tachyzoites were observed with immunohistochemistry in samples of the heart and skeletal muscles.

the microscopic lesions in the adult goats were glioses  , and perivascular mononuclear cuffs in the cerebral cortex , obex , thalamus , pons, cerebellum, caudal and rostral colliculi , and cervical, thoracic, and lumbar portions of the spinal cord . goat  <dig> displayed discrete perivascular cuffs in the meninges. multinucleate giant cells were seen associated with a focal inflammatory response in the cerebral cortex , pons , and obex  . neospora caninum cysts were observed in the cerebral cortex , rostral colliculus , obex , cervical, thoracic, and lumbar segments of the spinal cord , the neuronal cytoplasm in the obex  , and the cervical spinal cord . no lesions were observed in the male goat or fetuses used as negative controls.

two adult goats  had focal lymphoplasmacytic myositis in their skeletal muscles , but these lesions could not be associated with the parasite.

immunohistochemistry
neospora caninum
parasitic cysts and tachyzoites of n. caninum were immunolabeled in fetuses  <dig> and 4– <dig> and parasitic cysts in the adult male goats 2– <dig> . the parasitic structures were negative for t. gondii.

gfap
gfap immunolabeling was observed in the cells within the glial foci in the cerebral cortex , in the colliculi , and in an extensive area of gliosis in the cortex associated with a parasitic cyst , with characteristic astrocytosis  and astrogliosis . gfap immunolabeling was also intense in the astrocytes adjacent to the glial foci in the cerebral cortex  and in the lumbar spinal cord . in the adult goats, gfap immunolabeling occurred in the glial foci in the cerebral cortex  and the thalamus , and goats  <dig> and  <dig> displayed numerous and extremely dense astrocytic processes  .

pcna
pcna labeling occurred in the macrophages of the perivascular cuffs in the cerebral cortex , thalamus , pons, caudal colliculus, and cerebellum , and in the microglia of the glial foci in the cerebral cortex , thalamus , rostral colliculus, peduncle, and cerebellum , and cervical spinal cord .

mhc-ii
mhc-ii immunolabeling occurred in the adult goats: in the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells of the meningeal blood vessels  and the vessels of the cerebral parenchyma; in macrophages of the perivascular cuffs in the cerebral cortex , obex , pons, cervical spinal cord, cerebellum, thalamus, and caudal colliculus . mhc-ii immunolabeling was also seen in the glial foci in the cerebral cortex  , obex , and the cervical spinal cord . in fetuses  <dig> and  <dig>  mhc-ii labeling was observed in the glial foci, endothelia, and the perivascular cuffs.

cd79α
rare immunolabeled b lymphocytes were observed in the perivascular cuffs and glial foci in the pons, cervical spinal cord, and thalamus of goat  <dig> 

pcr and sequencing
neospora caninum dna was detected with pcr in the cns samples of the fetuses  and goats   and sequenced. the nucleotide sequences showed  <dig> % homology with the corresponding sequence in n. caninum.

discussion
the cns is an immunologically privileged tissue, and the control of the immune responses there depends on the relationships between various internal factors because the blood–brain barrier restricts the migration of many cells and molecules of the immune system  <cit> . the gliosis, necrotic lesions, and mononuclear perivascular cuffs found in the aborted fetuses have been described previously in fetuses with neosporosis  <cit> . however, the gliosis and perivascular cuffs associated with parasitic cysts of n. caninum in the adult goats have not been described. bishop et al.  <cit>  described similar lesions in an adult sheep, with infection confirmed by pcr and the occurrence of protozoan tachyzoite-like structures in the vascular endothelium. however, this is the first report of cysts in the cns of adult male goats. sawada et al.  <cit>  described gliosis and severe perivascular cuffs in a cow whose infection was confirmed by isolating the infective agent in cell culture.

multinucleate giant cells were present in the cns of the adult male goats in this study, probably associated with the phagocytosis of parasitic structures. similar findings in an aborted goat fetus were described by corbellini et al.  <cit> . several studies of n. caninum infection have described perivascular cuffs, but have not described the phenotypes of the cells in those lesions  <cit> . in this study, lectin histochemistry with rca <dig> allowed us to identify the cells in the perivascular cuffs and the glial foci, which we characterized as a monocytic lineage  <cit> . anti-pcna labeling also suggested the activation of the resident microglia in the cns, and the possible migration of blood monocytes, corresponding to the macrophages in the perivascular cuffs.

although rca <dig> also stains endothelial cells and reactive astrocytes, when the morphologies of the cells labeled with both rca <dig> and gfap were compared, there was no doubt as to their origin  and numbers.

gfap is the most important marker of astrocytes  <cit> . astrocytes were observed in the glial foci in the fetuses and adult goats, and on the borders of glioses located in the transition zone between the gray matter and white matter in two fetuses.

these findings are characteristic of astrogliosis, and demonstrate the participation of astrocytes in the lesions associated with n. caninum infection. this was reinforced by the observation of an agglomeration of astrocytes close to an n. caninum cyst. these lesions suggest glial scarring, in which astrocytes attempt to isolate a focal lesion to ensure local homeostasis in the cns  <cit> . drogemuller et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the activation of astrocytes in t. gondii infections, together with the expression of a protein  that is important in the resolution of infection.

there were few labeled b or t lymphocytes in the lesions, in either the fetuses or adult animals, which could reflect the incomplete activation of lymphocytes in the cns, which probably culminated in their rapid destruction through apoptosis  <cit> .

the expression of mhc-ii molecules in the cns was clearly established in the adult goats and in one fetus. the presence of the parasite in the cns probably triggered the inflammatory response that stimulated the expression of mhc-ii molecules by endothelial cells and activated the microglia in the cns. this was probably mediated by interferon γ, in accordance with the theory proposed by aloisi et al.  <cit> . these findings suggest that a predominantly th <dig> immune response was induced against the parasite. becher et al.  <cit>  proposed that activated astrocytes in cns lesions express mhc-ii molecules, but this was not observed in the present study.

another important finding was the occurrence of encephalitis, sometimes severe and with focal granulomatous inflammation, associated  with the parasitic cysts in the cns of clinically healthy adult goats.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that macrophages and microglia were the predominant inflammatory cells in the cns of aborted fetuses and healthy adult male goats infected with n. caninum. activated astrocytes were mainly associated with inflamed areas, suggesting that astrocytes were involved in the resolution of the lesions.
