BACKGROUND
ricin, a  <dig> to  <dig> kda glycoprotein derived from beans of the castor plant , is a lectin and member of the a-b toxin family. the b-chain carries the lectin function and binds to specific sugar residues of the target cell surface, allowing ricin to be internalized by endocytosis  <cit> . the a-chain  has rna n-glycosidase activity, removing a highly conserved adenine residue in the sarcin/ricin loop of 28s rrna. the rna depurination in the ribosome inhibits docking of elongation factor  <dig>  and prevents attachment of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. the result is irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis and eventual cell death  <cit> . ricin is on the second priority list of the cdc and is regarded as a high risk for being utilised as a bioweapon.

ricin is hydrosoluble and, with an estimated ld <dig> by ingestion of  <dig> mg/kg in humans, may potentially be used to contaminate food or beverages . oral intoxications with ricin are encountered in medicine, as accidents usually involving small children, and in suicide attempts among adults. eight, well-chewed castor beans may be fatal to a  <dig> kg adult  <cit> . ricin administered parenterally to mice has a ld <dig> of  <dig> –  <dig> μg/kg body weight  <cit> . the toxin has also been administered parenterally to humans, with the most famous case being that of georgi markov, a bulgarian dissident, allegedly killed with ricin in london  <cit> . ricin has also been involved in an assassination attempt in paris  <cit> . although oral and parenteral intoxication have been problematic, the intoxication route most feared and the one that causes the most harm, is the pulmonary route. pulmonary intoxication of ricin shares the same ld <dig> as the parenteral route  <cit> , but an aerosol delivery can disperse ricin over a larger population and result in damage to many more individuals than stabs in the arm or leg.

ricin can be produced by individuals using basic equipment and a rudimentary knowledge of chemistry  <cit> . since ricinus communis has a world-wide distribution and many plants are grown for decorative purposes, collecting castor bean seeds provides a ready source for toxin production. r. communis is also cultivated in the fields to extract, on an industrial scale, castor oil that is used in the chemical industry. by weight, the mash, a side product of oil extraction, can be  <dig> to 5% ricin. during world war ii, large scale production of ricin resulted in the "w" bomb  <cit> . during the early 1980s, weaponization of ricin occurred in certain states despite being forbidden by international treaties  <cit> .

until recently, diagnostic and therapeutic tools for identifying ricin intoxication via the lung were not available  <cit> . this need led our team to develop the first para-clinical test for the diagnosis of pulmonary intoxication caused by ricin  <cit> . since then, other investigators have isolated single-domain antibodies in hopes of developing automated detection systems useful for ricin diagnostics  <cit> .

regarding therapeutics, sophisticated approaches tested thus far have failed to produce synthetic molecules effective for treatment of pulmonary ricin intoxication  <cit> . additionally, following efforts to produce vaccines inducing neutralizing antibodies against this toxin, two vaccines are under trials but such vaccines may only partially reduce lung damage caused by the aerosolised form of ricin  <cit> . previous studies using anti-ricin antibodies of animal origin have, however, shown that these iggs, in particular when aerosolised, are efficacious in animal models of ricin pulmonary intoxication  <cit> . thus, at the present time, anti-ricin antibodies provide the primary therapeutic available for ricin intoxication.

recombinant anti-ricin antibodies should prove useful for both prophylactics and therapeutics in humans. so far however, development of antibodies for human use have only yielded, in a chinese laboratory, one chimeric antibody thus composed of murine variable regions and human constant regions  <cit> . this antibody, belonging to a first generation of recombinant antibodies, would very likely induce adverse side effects  and have poor tolerance in vivo, due to its murine component. in the present study we isolated, from a non-human primate  immune library, a human-like scfv, 43rca, that neutralized ricin very effectively and had a very high affinity for rca. this affinity is amongst the highest reached for scfvs isolated from any library, without in vitro affinity enhancement. in particular, the antibody affinity is approximately  <dig> times better than previous antibody fragments obtained with the same technique  <cit> . the nhp antibody fragments, like 43rca, are very similar to their human counterparts, and suitable for "germline humanizing"   <cit>  in order to ensure their excellent tolerance.

RESULTS
animal immunization
one male macaque was immunised with the a chain of ricin . after five rca-a injections, the elisa titre towards whole ricin as an antigen, was equal to  <dig>  <dig> 

library construction and isolation of scfv specific for ricin
the fifth  boost was given eight months after the fourth rca-a injection. three days before the boost, no pcr products could be obtained from the bone marrow using our primers. amplification was only possible after the last boost and these products were thus regarded to probably code specifically for rca-a specific antibodies. more precisely, three days after the fifth boost, amplification was detected with  <dig> of the  <dig> pairs of primers utilized for amplifying dna encoding the vh fragment, and with all  primer pairs utilized for vlκ. the most diverse dna was obtained on days  <dig> and  <dig>  when all pairs of primers strongly amplified dna that then declined on the 14th day  pairs positive for vh and for vlκ). the vlλ primers were tested later using the cdna originating from the seventh day and mhvl1-f <dig>  mhvl1-f <dig>  mhvl2-f <dig>  mhvl3-f <dig>  mhvl4-f <dig> and mhvl9/ <dig>  allowed dna amplification. all the pcr products amplified from the cdna obtained on the 7th day were precloned into pgemt, in order to obtain sub-libraries of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  clones for the dna coding the vh, the vlκ or vlλ fragments respectively. the scfv libraries were constructed in phal <dig> using two cloning steps, starting independently with the vlκ or vlλ sub-libraries. sizes of the final scfv libraries were  <dig>  ×  <dig> clones for the κ and  <dig> ×  <dig> clones for the λ libraries, respectively containing approximately 75% and 95% full-size inserts as determined by colony pcr. both antibody gene libraries were packaged with hyperphage and yielded a good scfv surface presentation determined by sds-page, western blot and anti-piii immunostain . both libraries were pooled for panning.

primer names indicate whether they hybridize within the variable  or constant  region of the dna.

isolation of anti-ricin scfvs
while the library was obtained from a macaque immunized with the rca-a, it was panned with ricin since the whole toxin was our final target molecule. during panning, the number of eluted phages rose from  <dig> , to  <dig> ×  <dig>  and finally to  <dig> ×  <dig> phages . this increase typically indicated enrichment in phages interacting specifically with the antigen. a phage-elisa utilising ricin and rca-a as antigens was performed to assess reactivity of the selected phages. before panning, the signals on both antigens were at the background level, and both signals increased to five-fold over background after the first and the second rounds of panning. according to the phage technology, such signal increases correspond to enrichment in high-affinity binders. after a third round, the signal on rca-a further increased as expected and it was 15-fold higher than the background, and 25-fold higher on ricin, which would be in agreement with the fact that whole ricin had been utilized for panning. the phagemidic dna was extracted from the library after its third round of panning, and transformed into e. coli hb <dig>  <cit> . fifty clones were isolated and each monoclonal phagemidic dna was extracted for sequencing. in parallel, these clones were induced for expression.

ricin neutralization in cell-based assays, scfv stability
of the  <dig> clones isolated after the panning, only  <dig> possessed full-sized, non-redundant sequences that were expressed for further testing in vitro. at the highest scfv concentration , clone 9rca showed only 30% inhibition of cellular toxicity even though the molar ratio / was in 150-fold excess. all other clones had neutralizing properties either equal, or less than, clone 9rca. exceptions included clones 43rca, 38rca, and 44rca only. by using the cell-based assay, the ic <dig> of clone 44rca was  <dig> ±  <dig> ng/ml and that of clone 38rca,  <dig> ±  <dig> ng/ml. the best clone, 43rca, had an ic <dig> equal to  <dig> ±  <dig> ng/ml , representing a molar ratio / equal to  <dig>  this clone was sufficiently expressed  to allow further study.

in order to determine scfv stability, the scfvs were incubated in culture media for  <dig> h . the reactivity of clones 43rca, 44rca, and 38rca was not affected by incubation as assessed by elisa. the stability of these three scfvs generally differed from other scfvs that showed less neutralization capacity, as the latter lost between  <dig> and 75% of their ability to bind toxin in an elisa after they were exposed to the same conditions.

ricin neutralization in cell-free assays
in order to appreciate whether anti-ricin scfv could function as an effective therapeutic against ricin intoxication, 43rca was tested for its ability to neutralize ricin biological activity using a cell-free translation assay. the scfv 43rca neutralized 89% of ricin activity at  <dig> μg/ml, and even concentrations of  <dig> μg/ml neutralized 60% of ricin activity when compared to controls containing ricin only .  <dig>  μg/ml of 43rca  neutralized 50% of the activity of ricin, present at a  <dig> nm concentration in this assay, thus the corresponding molar ratio / is equal to  <dig>  in the same order of magnitude than for the cell-based assay . the activity of 43rca was compared with the neutralizing capacity of anti-ricin iggs purified by protein a from sera of mice hyper-immunised with the deglycosylated ricin a chain , the most neutralizing antibodies available to us. by using the same concentrations, the anti-dgrca iggs showed ~20% neutralization at  <dig> μg/ml, and none at  <dig> μg/ml. the molecular weight of a scfv is  <dig> kda with one paratope, while the molecular weight of an igg is  <dig> kda with two paratopes. as a consequence, the molecular weight of a paratope in the form of an igg is three times larger than that of a scfv, and an igg concentration of  <dig> μg/ml represents approximately the same molar paratope concentration as the scfv concentration at  <dig> μg/ml. at this same concentration of paratopes, the scfv neutralizes ricin three times more efficiently than the polyclonal igg.

affinity determination
affinity measurements focused on the best neutralizing scfvs. the affinity of 43rca against ricin was initially evaluated in standard conditions, using ~ <dig> seconds elution steps, and resulting in an excellent affinity of approximately  <dig> pm. the kd of 38rca measured under the same conditions yielded  <dig> pm. in contrast, the affinity of 44rca was  <dig>  nm, or 100-fold less favourable, although considered high in absolute terms. because 43rca neutralisation activity was four times higher than 38rca, we focused our work upon this more efficient scfv. a more precise measurement of 43rca's affinity, performed by lengthening the elution time and by using a small scfv immobilization level  , gave values of  <dig>  pm after a  <dig> hr elution and  <dig>  pm after a  <dig> hr elution. measured after a  <dig> hr elution step, the kon was equal to  <dig>   <dig> m - <dig> s - <dig> and the koff,  <dig>  10- <dig> s- <dig>  the quality of these affinity measurements was assessed by the internal consistency test, which had numerical values of  <dig>   and  <dig>   when these values have to be inferior to  <dig> for the measurements to be valid.

computational analysis
of the  <dig> isolated clones, only  <dig> full-sized sequences coding for scfvs could be obtained. on these sequences,  <dig> were present in  <dig> occurrences  and one was present in  <dig> occurrences . such repetitions may be informative since they could signal scfvs selected due to their high affinity, as was the case with 44rca. the  <dig> non-redundant sequences coding the vh and vl domain were automatically analyzed using the imgt/v-quest software. human germline v,  or j alleles, found most similar to these  <dig> sequences, are shown on tables  <dig> and  <dig>  in parallel, those sequences were analysed using a new online tool , and this analysis was presented in the form of a phylogenetic tree . the initial root of the tree separated the scfvs in two sub-trees, corresponding to two clusters. cluster a, corresponding to the sub-tree presented on the upper part of the figure, comprised three subgroups , whose light chains were of the λ isotype. the 13rca and 30rca pair differed only by two nucleotides  and probably resulted from the same parental igg by somatic hypermutations, which did not lead to a significantly better neutralization effect. beside their vlλ,  <dig> rca and  <dig> rca were not related to the rest of cluster a, and were removed from the remainder of the study. analysis of the  genes arranged to code for the  <dig> remaining scfvs composing cluster a permitted an evaluation of its diversity. typically, the vh of these scfvs were coded by a unique combination of a single ighv gene  re-arranged with a single ighd gene  and with a single ighj gene  , except for one occurrence in ighv4- <dig>  and two occurrences in ighd1- <dig>  combined with ighj <dig>  the vl of these  <dig> scfvs were coded by iglv1- <dig> and iglv3- <dig> on three occurrences each, while another iglv gene  was used twice. the iglj genes coding vl were rather constant, with iglj <dig> genes on six occurrences, in addition to one using of igl <dig> and igl <dig> genes. overall, the  <dig> main scfvs in cluster a showed limited diversity and encompassed none of the three best clones. in contrast, cluster b, composed of  <dig> scfvs , contained more variability. six different ighv genes  were combined with  <dig> different ighd genes  and two different ighj genes . similarly, the  <dig> κ light chains of cluster b were coded by a combination of  <dig> igkv genes  and  <dig> igkj genes . thus, detailed analysis of the genes re-arranged to code for the scfvs constituting clusters a and b showed that b had a higher diversity than a. this higher diversity of cluster b was also evidenced by the longer branches of the b subtree as compared to a, and this diversity very possibly allowed cluster b to encompass all the best clones. such a difference of diversity between clusters is much more easily observed from the tree and subtrees than analysed as detailed above. the presentation of the diversity of antibody sequences in the form of trees could be of further interest when analyzing antibody fragments isolated from a library, even though these trees were not initially designed for this purpose.

human germline genes were retrieved by imgt/v-quest analysis.

human germline genes were retrieved by imgt/v-quest analysis.

the 43rca scfv was the most efficient scfv for neutralization of ricin biological activity, and had very similar human germline counterparts as identified by imgt/v-quest software. the overall identity between 43rca eight framework regions and their most similar peptidic sequences, coded by human germinal genes, was 90%. in the imgt collier de perles representation of 43rca , black squares indicated amino acids that differ from the closest human germline genes ighv3-11* <dig> and ighj4* <dig> for vh and igkv1-17* <dig> and igkj4* <dig> for vl. by using imgt amino acid classes  <cit> , an analysis of the physicochemical properties of these differing 43rca framework residues was performed and its results summarized in table  <dig>  in particular, the proximity of 43rca with sequences coded by human germline genes was further appreciated by the fact that only four residues, three located in vh   and one in vl  on a total of  <dig> framework residues, were rated as very dissimilar.

differences between 43rca vh and vl framework amino acids, and those coded by most similar human genes, are evaluated on a 5-level scale  and located in each framework region.

discussion
by immunizing with the chain a of ricin , a toxin subunit, we developed a non-human primate  immune library screened with whole ricin, and we isolated an scfv with picomolar affinity for ricin.

when immunizing with rca-a, a plant protein that is presumably very different from the macaque self proteins, we anticipated our antigen would be strongly recognised as foreign and elicit a strong immune response. after three injections however, assessment of anti-ricin antibody via an elisa with rca-a as the antigen resulted in unexpectedly low titres . after a 4th injection, serum was again tested using an elisa with both rca-a and whole ricin as antigens. although rca-a was the immunogen, titres against rca-a were 7-fold lower than those against ricin. the differences were probably due to the conformational changes of the subunit when coated onto the plate. the titre measured against whole ricin was 1: <dig>  after the fourth injection, indicating a strong antibody response in this nhp. this hypothesis was confirmed when amplification products were obtained with our antibody-specific primers   <dig> days after the last  injection, the earliest products we had ever obtained. all pairs of primers allowed amplification  <dig> days later . when compared to our previous work with bacillus anthracis protective antigen  in which the optimal amplification was obtained  <dig> days after the last immunization, these high responses obtained as early as  <dig> days after the last immunization were interesting and significant. we hypothesized that this early response, obtained from immunogen-stimulated lymphocytes at the beginning of antigen circulation and thus present at low concentrations, corresponded to the existence of high-affinity surface immunoglobulins that would later be secreted by these lymphocytes. a high library diversity is however necessary to encompass scfvs with the desired specificity . we chose, in order to build the library, the pcr products obtained on the 7th day because, at this still early time after the boost, all pcr primers permitted amplification. for the first time in this study, we also utilized primers designed to amplify vlλ-coding dnas. the cdna, that had been previously extracted from bone marrow on the two best days, had been stored  and was re-utilized:  <dig> out of the  <dig> human λ primers permitted amplification, though more weakly than the macaque κ primers. as a consequence, vlλ pre-cloning was rather inefficient and the size of the vlλ sub-library was ten times smaller than the vlκ library.

after the pre-cloning and cloning steps, the size of the pooled  anti-ricin library was  <dig> ×  <dig> clones; therefore, it was not significantly higher than our former anti-lethal factor  library , and this size could not explain the high affinities encountered in this study  <cit> . because we wanted to search for scfv that would interact with the whole toxin and not a chain alone, and also because of the conformationnal change of rca-a when coated onto elisa plates, the library was panned against whole ricin. after panning, while  <dig> clones were isolated for sequencing, only  <dig> full-sized, non-redundant sequences were obtained. approximately half of these sequences had vl of the λ isotype, despite the small size of the vlλ library, probably indicating interest of the λ primers, which were specially designed for the present library construction. these  <dig> clones were expressed and initially tested for neutralization as the neutralizing activity, not affinity, was a goal of the present study. since there was not a standardized test for ricin neutralization, we chose to establish a cell-based ricin neutralization assay as an adaption of the assay we previously utilized on numerous occasions to assess the neutralization of anthrax lethal toxin  <cit> . this cell-based assay utilised the mouse macrophage j774a. <dig> cell line , which is also sensitive to ricin  <cit> . we plated j774a. <dig> cells with ricin  for  <dig> hours to induce approximately 100% cell death this test is stringent because of its long duration that necessitated scfvs of high affinities to form stable scfv-ricin complexes. we also showed that scfv stability was indeed crucial in this test for effective neutralization of ricin.

by using the cell-based neutralization assay, there was only one clone  that neutralized 50% of the ricin toxicity with a scfv/toxin molar ratio equal to four. neutralization by the second best clone  was found to be  <dig> times less efficient. precise affinity measurements thus focused on 43rca. to the best of our knowledge, the obtained value of  <dig> pm is amongst the best affinities obtained directly from any library panning, without the need for further affinity engineering. this value was not an aberration, since the second best clone also had picomolar affinity. these final results were in accordance to our initial hypothesis, supported by the early pcr product amplification, that the immune response to ricin would be strong. the value of 43rca for therapeutics was further assessed in a cell-free translation assay, where it was favourably compared to igg obtained from serum of mice hyperimmunized with the dgrca-a. this polyclonal has a high neutralization capacity and, in particular, it was more efficient than any monoclonal at our disposal. the fact that 43rca scfv fragment produced in vitro had an efficiency three times higher that of hyperimmune polyclonal igg suggests that this anti-ricin scfv  could be a therapeutic of choice against ricin intoxication.

the analysis of scfv sequences, by using the new online tool  to build a phylogenetic tree, grouped the scfvs in two clusters  with a showing less variability than b. the higher diversity of b certainly explains why it encompassed all three outstanding best clones . the diversity of cluster b was quickly appreciated from the branch lengths of the corresponding phylogenetic sub-tree, as opposed to the sub-tree representing cluster a. in the future, these phylogenetic trees could well be a useful guide for the testing of clones eluted from immune libraries, all the more if more numerous sequences are to be analyzed. systematic analysis of all clones should probably be reserved to highly variable clusters, represented by long-branched sub-trees, while sampling of only a limited number of scfvs originating from the least variable  clusters might be sufficient.

CONCLUSIONS
nhp immune libraries have formerly allowed us to isolate two neutralizing antibody fragments directed at each subunit  of the anthrax lethal toxin. in this current study, we successfully developed an antibody fragment to neutralize another bioweapon , ricin, and this antibody fragment has now been expressed as a full-size igg, to be tested in vivo in the future and possibly utilised for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes. this approach might be re-utilized as antibodies can efficiently neutralize a vast majority of the numerous bw . our nhp antibody fragments can be "germline-humanized"   <cit>  to ensure their excellent bioavailibility and tolerance. such predicable pharmacokinetics properties are in opposition to the situation of less predictable synthetic molecules, which fail at an alarmingly high rate  during clinical trials. the end result is loss of significant expenditures and time. this failure rate has not, however, prevented studies in search of synthetic molecules against ricin  <cit> . this is despite a situation where the efficacy of antibodies to neutralize ricin  had been well documented  <cit> , but only one chimeric anti-ricin antibody was available  <cit> . thus, choosing and financing a more risky path towards therapeutics than the isolation of more effective anti-ricin antibodies, typically focused on human antibodies, tends in particular to indicate that the isolation of such human antibodies is somehow difficult.

a similar situation was encountered regarding antibodies directed against the lf subunit of anthrax lethal toxins, in that very few anti-lf antibodies were obtained despite requirements by anthrax experts, while the isolation of many anti-pa antibodies has been financed. the anthrax situation might be particularly revealing, because anti-pa antibodies were, in their large majority, obtained with techniques that started with lymphocytes of anthrax-vaccinated donors. the anthrax vaccine  lacks lf, thus explaining the rarity of human lf-primed lymphocytes and finally of anti-lf antibodies. similarly, the scarcity of ricin-primed human lymphocytes certainly explains the absence of human anti-ricin recombinant antibodies. humans are not naturally exposed to ricin, and there is not a vaccine approved for human use, at present. naïve and synthetic libraries of human antibody fragments, and mice engineered with human igg-coding dna, have been developed to produce human antibodies without the need for lymphocytes from immunized humans. however, it is interesting to note that these tools were not successful, or not utilized, in the two examples quoted above.

in summary of the present study, we have developed improvements in several aspects of our cost-conscious path towards obtaining neutralizing nhp recombinant antibody fragments for clinical purposes. due to their proximity with their human counterparts, plus the possibility of "super-humanizing" these antibody fragments  <cit> , such reagents would provide well tolerated therapy against ricin, anthrax, as well as other bw agents. in addition, our methodology developed in the current study should be of interest to researchers beyond the field of bw.
