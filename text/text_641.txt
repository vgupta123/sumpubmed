BACKGROUND
genomic analyses of related organisms are central for addressing the evolution of genome organisation as well as for supporting the identification of the genetic background of economically and biologically important traits. with genetic linkage maps and genome sequence information available across taxa, it is possible to study evolutionary processes ranging from major structural changes like whole-genome duplications and chromosome rearrangements to fine scale differences such as single base substitutions. the rate of chromosomal rearrangements differs widely both among and within eukaryotic lineages  <cit> . although the exact mechanisms creating rearrangements are unknown, repetitive elements seem to be an important trigger as breakpoint regions of rearrangements are enriched in various classes of repeats  <cit> . changes in chromosome numbers may occur through fission and fusion of chromosomes, or more radically through polyploidization . the highly variable rate observed for gross chromosomal rearrangements in different lineages is also evident at the nucleotide substitution level  <cit> . base substitutions at neutral sites occur at a rate equivalent to the mutation rate. this rate is affected by the number of mitotic cell divisions in animal germ lines or in plant cell lines ultimately forming gametes, during which replication errors can cause mutations. with information on divergence times obtained from the fossil record and estimates of the number of neutral substitutions in orthologous genes  one can through the relationship, r = k/  <cit>  estimate neutral substitution rates . although there is uncertainty in the dating of divergence times using the fossil record, this method gives rough estimates of the rate of silent substitutions in the species under study. in addition, the formula can be applied for studying relative timing of speciation and genome duplication events by comparing the number of substitutions in paralogous and orthologus genes, assuming constant substitution rates through evolutionary time. it is generally thought that orthologs share similar functions whereas paralogs often have different functions, and therefore paralogs are expected to diverge more per unit time than orthologs. this has however recently been questioned as orthologs might obtain new functions at a similar rate as paralogs  <cit> . furthermore, functional change is not expected to affect silent substitution rates.

salix and populus species are trees, shrubs or sub-shrubs and members of the salicaceae family. they share many characteristics such as dioecy, rapid growth and seed development, and ease with which they can be vegetatively propagated. species across both genera typically have a haploid chromosome number of  <dig> and small and convenient genomes sizes  compared to the large genomes of most conifers . based on the fossil record, the divergence of the two genera has been dated to approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . populus is recognized as a model genus for genetic and genomic studies in angiosperm trees, with many resources available such as the genome sequence of populus trichocarpa http://genome.jgi-psf.org/poptr1_1/poptr1_ <dig> home.html,  <cit> , linkage maps  <cit>  and microarrays  <cit> .

the genus salix comprises more than  <dig> species and is widespread in both the northern and the southern hemisphere, excluding australasia and new guinea. many salix species display rapid growth and high biomass yields, even when nitrogen fertilizers are used sparsely  <cit> . these characteristics together with ease of establishment and a broad range of adaptability explain the wide-spread use of salix spp. for short rotation biomass production. the large phenotypic variation within and among salix species facilitates the identification of quantitative trait loci  in experimental populations. also, natural populations of salix typically display high genetic diversity and are likely to contain many low-frequency alleles that underlie outstanding phenotypes useful to breeders  <cit> . salix viminalis, s. dascyclados and s. schwerinii and their hybrids are some of the most commonly used salix species in the breeding programs in europe. these species have also been the focus of most past investigations of salix genetics, which include the generation of linkage maps  <cit>  and qtl analyses i.e. frost resistance and phenology  <cit> , growth, water-use efficiency and drought tolerance  <cit> . as the use of willow as a source of biomass is expected to increase in the near future , one can foresee a rising demand for high yielding willow clones that are adapted to different environments and resistant to a wide repertoire of pathogens. this is going to put more pressure on breeding activities and more efficient ways to select useful clones will be needed. one method that can strongly support these activities is "marker assisted selection" , i.e. selection on easily detectable genetic markers in genes linked to qtls underlying phenotypic traits. mas should be particularly useful for traits that are difficult to measure, exhibit low heritability, and/or are expressed late in development, such as productivity, disease resistance, drought and heat tolerance. to develop efficient mas in willow, qtls and ultimately genes responsible for selected phenotypic traits must first be identified. quantitative traits are expected to have complicated genetic backgrounds including many genes, and complex interactions between them. mapping such traits requires dense linkage maps, large mapping populations and thorough phenotyping of plants grown both in greenhouse and in field experiments over multiple seasons.

in this study we present two willow genetic linkage maps based on two mapping populations with the major aim of investigating the degree of genomic conservation between willow and poplar . the first more detailed map  is based on a s. viminalis ×  cross using snp, microsatellite and aflp markers. the second map  is based on a s. viminalis × s. viminalis cross and snp and microsatellite markers. both maps are considerably more detailed than previously available willow linkage maps, and in contrast to those they are to a large extent based on snp markers with a genome-wide distribution for which the corresponding positions in the poplar genome are known. it was therefore possible to investigate the degree of synteny and gene-order conservation across a significant part of the two salicaceae genomes by comparing the willow linkage maps with the physical map constructed from the poplar genome sequence. this is a useful approach for studying genome evolution between less well studied species and model plant species with sequenced genomes. in addition, we estimated the number of substitutions in introns  between orthologous and paralogous genes in willow and poplar, and used the distributions of these estimates to infer the relative age of the divergence between the lineages leading to salix and populus and age of the whole genome duplication shared by these lineages.

RESULTS
snp markers and genotyping
in total,  <dig> willow gene fragments containing snps were evaluated for genotyping at the snp technology platform . of these  <dig> snps,  <dig> were identified using primers developed for the purpose of this study, representing  <dig> different genes, hence, a number of genes contained multiple snps.  <dig> snps were previously identified in phenology candidate genes   and  <dig> snps  were identified using primers from hanley et al. . see additional file  <dig> for marker information and primer sequences. homology searches against the poplar genome with the  <dig> willow sequences developed in this study indicated a most significant hit at the position of the expected target in all but  <dig> instances . in  <dig> of these cases, the willow sequence was more similar to the paralogous gene copy  than to the orthologous gene expected to be amplified . furthermore, the positions in the willow genome match the positions of paralog  <dig> in the poplar genome in all but one case , suggesting that the paralogs were erroneously amplified and sequenced in willow. xi_14om is unique in the sense that based on sequence homology, the willow sequence is most similar to paralog  <dig> in poplar, however the position in the willow genome does not agree with the position of paralog  <dig> in poplar. in the other four cases, the willow sequences showed best sequence homology to genomic regions other than the expected .

 <dig> snps were selected and genotyped in the s <dig> and s <dig> mapping populations. in a first panel of  <dig> snps conversion rate was 92%  and the overall sample call rate for the approved snps was  <dig> %. the reproducibility was 100% according to duplicate analysis of  <dig> % of the genotypes. in the second  <dig> snp panel, the snp conversion rate was 83%  and the overall sample call rate for the approved snps was  <dig> %. the reproducibility was 100% according to duplicate analysis of  <dig> % of the genotypes.

linkage mapping
after excluding snps that were monomorphic or contained null alleles, segregation data for  <dig> snps in  <dig> individuals were used to construct linkage map s <dig> .  <dig> markers were heterozygous only in the female parent,  <dig> only in the male parent and  <dig> were heterozygous in both. in addition,  <dig> microsatellite markers were included, of which  <dig> segregated in both parents, six were maternally informative and  <dig> were paternally informative. finally,  <dig> aflp markers were included, with genotypic data on  <dig> individuals. consensus linkage maps were constructed using all  <dig> markers together. in the lod groupings step in joinmap, markers were grouped at a lod threshold of  <dig>  and  <dig> linkage groups were identified of which three were duplets and three contained only four markers. the other  <dig> groups represent the  <dig> linkage groups in poplar .  <dig> aflp markers were unlinked and excluded from further analysis. for the markers within each group, map calculations were performed in joinmap based on recombination frequencies, which is the step when linked markers are placed on linkage groups and ordered relative to each other. for five groups  no consensus lgs could be calculated due to lack of markers segregating in both parents. these groups were split into the parental groups and the markers tested separately within each parental group. a number of markers remained unlinked after the map calculations due to insufficient linkage to the other markers. these markers were tested separately within groups to examine if any of them were linked to each other. a number of small groups were defined in this way and included in the map. ten of the groups  contained only aflps and since they cannot be connected to the poplar genome they were excluded from further discussion. after inspection of lg vi, marker ph <dig> was removed because of inconsistency in the placement of this marker compared to s <dig> and poplar.

in general, the s <dig> map without the aflp markers was in very good agreement with the map including the aflp markers. however, in lg viii the gene order differed slightly when constructing the map with or without the aflp markers. since the gene order in this linkage group without the aflp markers was in better agreement with the gene order in the poplar genome as well as with the s <dig> map, we present lg viii without aflp markers in figure  <dig> . furthermore, ii-24_sa on lg ii was not mapped when no aflp markers were included.  <dig> markers in map s <dig> showed distorted segregation ratios . xi_21_sa and r_66_sa were removed because they were distorted and had a high number of missing genotypes. the consensus s <dig> linkage map with  <dig> linked markers aligned to the poplar physical map is shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the map spanned  <dig> cm with an average interval between the markers of  <dig>  cm. the linkage groups a to f and the female linkage groups present on lgs ii, v, xiv, xv and xix, where no consensus maps were constructed are not included in the total map length.

 <dig> snps genotyped in  <dig> individuals were used to construct the linkage map s <dig>   <dig> snps segregated in the female parent only,  <dig> in the male parent only, and  <dig> in both parents.  <dig> microsatellite markers were also included,  <dig> of which segregated in both parents,  <dig> were maternally informative and seven were paternally informative . consensus linkage maps were constructed using all  <dig> markers. for map s <dig>  marker groupings at a lod threshold of  <dig>  identified  <dig> linkage groups and seven markers remained unlinked. similarly to s <dig>  some markers that did not map to the other markers within linkage groups due to insufficient linkage were tested separately. groups ia, ib, v, vii, viii, ix, xii, xiv, xv, xvii and xviii are represented by more than one linkage group in s <dig>  and they were placed on the map based on positional information in s <dig> . the most plausible reasons why we were unable to detect linkage between the small groups and other linkage groups is likely an effect of the small mapping population and limited number of markers, and as a consequence markers flanking the gaps can be too far apart, contain too little information, or are separated by a region of high recombination rate. distorted segregation ratios  were found for  <dig> markers. r_24_sa and xvi_5_piii form a separate duplet that cannot with certainty be connected to any lg. the same applies to the group containing sb <dig> and vi_8_sa_piii.

there are no major rearrangements distinguishing the two willow maps, although there are a few apparent discrepancies in marker order on some lgs. most differences involve closely spaced markers located on small groups or at the distal ends of groups, where the exact positioning of markers is uncertain. in several cases there was a swop in the positioning of two markers with tiny genetic distances, most likely an effect of the small size of the s <dig> mapping population. the s <dig> consensus map, excluding the small groups s3a and s3b and the groups s3ia- <dig> and s3v- <dig> that could not be placed in groups ia and v respectively, consists of  <dig> markers aligned to the s <dig> map and is shown in additional file  <dig>  s <dig> spanned  <dig> cm with an average interval between the markers of  <dig>  cm.

we could link nine previously unmapped scaffolds in poplar to linkage groups in the willow genome . we were also able to merge some groups that were unlinked in hanley et al.  .

comparative mapping
we found two major interchromosomal rearrangements distinguishing the karyotype of willow from poplar, involving poplar lg i and xvi and willow lg ia and ib. markers located on poplar lg i are in willow placed on two different lgs; willow lg ia aligns to the first part of poplar lg i, from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb  and willow lg ib aligns to markers on the second part of poplar lg i, from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb. in addition, markers located on poplar xvi are in the willow map linked to lg ib. these data support either a fusion resulting in poplar lg i or a fission resulting in willow lg ia and ib sometime since the divergence of the two lineages. similarly, either a fission in the poplar lineage forming poplar lg i and xvi or a fusion in the willow lineage forming willow lg ib must have happened since the divergence of the two species .

seven markers in the willow map should based on sequence homology be true orthologs, but the position of the markers in the willow linkage map differs from the corresponding position in the poplar genome. these cases could possibly represent cases of translocation of limited chromosomal segments .

generally, gene order within syntenic groups is very well conserved in the willow - poplar comparison. however, the data indicate a few differences between the two genomes, five of which are inversions involving several markers each. three of these are located on willow lg ib  and correspond in size to ~ <dig>  -  <dig>  mb in the poplar genome sequence. in poplar, these regions correspond to parts of lg xvi and i. the other two supported inversions are located on lg xi and xviii and involve roughly half of the total lengths of the linkage groups  . for lg xi, the inversion is not evident in the s <dig> map, which shows the same marker order as poplar, while the inversion on lg xviii cannot be detected in the s <dig> map because the markers involved are located on a separate linkage group so the gene order cannot be determined. apart from these supported differences there are a number of suggested gene order differences between the willow and the poplar genomes, it is however uncertain whether or not there are true differences or errors in either the poplar genome assembly or the willow linkage maps. the assembly of the poplar genome is not complete and most likely the genome sequence as it is presented today contains numerous gaps.

sequence analyses
for  <dig> gene fragments where three sequences were present  alignments were constructed and used to estimate pairwise ki between orthologous loci in willow and poplar, paralogous loci in willow and poplar and paralogous loci in poplar . the willow sequence, the expected part of poplar paralog <dig> to be amplified and the total genomic sequence of poplar paralog  <dig> and default parameters were used to construct the alignments. a total of  <dig> kb genomic dna sequence were used for estimations of ki. as can be seen in the distributions of orthologous ki , there are sequence pairs with high ki values . this is likely a result of erroneous alignments when gaps were present in one of the sequences, or if parts of the overlapping sequences were missing, resulting in alignments of non-homologous nucleotides. it is however clear that the majority of orthologous sequence pairs have ki between  <dig>  and  <dig> . including all alignments, mean ki between orthologs in willow and poplar was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and the median ki was  <dig> . the distributions of ki values for paralogous loci show a peak in the number of sequence pairs around  <dig>  -  <dig> . mean ki between paralogs in willow and poplar was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and between the paralogs in poplar,  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the corresponding medians were  <dig>  and  <dig> . ki between orthologs were significantly lower than ki between paralogs in willow and poplar  and between paralogs in poplar . ki between the two estimates of paralogs were not significantly different .

discussion
based on our large sample of sequence based markers and large pedigrees we have studied genome evolution in species from two tree genera, salix and populus by constructing linkage maps in salix and aligning them to the populus trichocarpa genome sequence. the large number of snp markers with known location and even distribution in the poplar genome allowed the first detailed comparison between the two genomes. we have used the physical information from the poplar genome to approximate the proportion of the willow genome covered by our maps. the size of the poplar genome has been estimated to  <dig> ±  <dig> mb of which approximately  <dig> mb has been assembled  <cit>  and approximately  <dig> mb have been assigned to linkage groups according to the poplar genome website. our s <dig> linkage map covers about  <dig> mb of the poplar genome or 90% of the dna sequence assigned to linkage groups. most likely this fraction  of the poplar genome is mostly euchromatic dna including the majority of transcribed genes. as much as 40% of the whole poplar genome consists of repetitive elements  <cit>  and we assume that the majority of the unassembled genome sequence is heterochromatic dna. this means that our maps cover most of the genic regions of the genome with less coverage in the heterochromatic regions.

the willow markers form  <dig> major linkage groups, as expected based on the haploid chromosome number of  <dig>  aligning the willow linkage map to the poplar genome, we find strong support for two interchromosomal rearrangements since the divergence of the two lineages. one rearrangement involve poplar lg i and willow lg ia and ib, and is either a result of a fusion in the poplar lineage or a fission in the willow lineage since the divergence from a common ancestor. the second rearrangement involve poplar lg i and xvi and willow lg ib and is either a result of a fission in the poplar linage or a fusion in the willow lineage sometime since the divergence from a common ancestor. in support of our observations, hanley et al.  identified two groups in their willow map aligning to poplar lg i, but in that study, the willow lg aligning to poplar lg xvi was not linked to willow lg ib as was the case in the present study. the correspondence between lg ia and ib in hanley et al.  and ia and ib in the present study is supported by three common markers on ia and seven common markers on ib. the most plausible reason why we found support for linkage of willow ib and poplar xvi is the significantly higher number of snp markers in the present study while the majority of the markers in hanley et al.  were aflps.

three of the five inversions we found support for involved poplar lg i and xvi and willow lg ib. it thus appears that poplar lg i has been exposed to more changes, both inter- and intrachromosomal than any other linkage group. the analysis of the poplar genome  <cit>  revealed that poplar lg i is a result of multiple rearrangements involving three tandem fusions, rearrangements that seem to have taken place before the evolution of modern poplar species as revealed by colinear genetic maps among multiple poplar species  <cit> . these rearrangements possibly took place during the genome-wide reorganization and diploidization following the whole-genome duplication  that took place before the divergence of salix and populus but after the split from arabidopsis  <cit> . so, it seems that poplar lg i is the result of several changes occurring before the split of willow and poplar, and our results show that this linkage groups has been subjected to an elevated rate of rearrangements also after the divergence of salix and populus. one distinct feature of poplar lg i is that it contains significantly less euchromatin than any of the other  <dig> chromosomes, hence it is richer in heterochromatin and possibly repetitive dna  <cit> . since it is known that repetitive elements can trigger rearrangements this is one possible explanation to the many rearrangements involving lg i. it is also by far the largest lg in the willow map . the same applies to its physical length, poplar i and xvi is together at least  <dig> mb long , which is much longer than any other poplar lg, in fact the second largest  is only ~ <dig> mb long .

in addition to the above mentioned major rearrangements, seven markers had positions in willow and poplar that may reflect syntenic disparities between the genomes. they likely represent six different events of rearrangements because in two instances, markers are located next to each other and most likely reflect the same rearrangement events . in summary, a surprisingly small numbers of markers show evidence for rearrangements between willow and poplar, most likely reflecting the stability of the willow and poplar genomes.

using a divergence time of  <dig> my and counting the number of rearrangements between the poplar physical map and willow linkage maps , we end up with a rate of  <dig>  rearrangements/my/genome. comparisons of these figures with estimates from other species should be done with caution as they depend strongly on the resolution of the map as well as the accuracy of the divergence estimates. with this in mind we can conclude that the rate of rearrangements in willow and poplar is at the lower end compared to estimates in other plant species,   <cit> . the relatively few chromosomal rearrangements and greatly conserved gene order makes the use of poplar genomic resources for genetic and genomic works in willow very promising. this is of particular relevance for the identification of genes in willow qtls with the help of the poplar genome.

sequence analysis of orthologus and paralogous loci in willow and poplar
pairwise substitution rates in introns, ki, between orthologous and paralogous loci in willow and poplar were estimated in  <dig> gene fragments covering a total of  <dig> nucleotides. ki between willow and poplar orthologs were approximately three times lower  than between paralogs . the two latter estimates did not differ significantly, suggesting that the two lineages have similar evolutionary rates since their divergence. the large difference in substitution rates between orthologs and paralogs was unexpected as the genome duplication and the divergence of the two genera have been suggested to have occurred within a short time span some  <dig> -  <dig> mya  <cit> . our data clearly dispute this conclusion and instead suggest that the genome duplication occurred much earlier than the divergence of the two lineages.

according to interpretations of available fossil data, both salix and populus occur in middle eocene sediments that are around  <dig> million years old  <cit> . using this time as a proxy for the separation of the two lineages and ki =  <dig> , the rate of substitution  was estimated to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per site and year . assuming that this substitution rate has been constant since the salicoid duplication yields an estimated date of the genome duplication some  <dig> mya. this date is obviously much older than previous estimates, and is not consistent with other data showing that the salicoid duplication is not shared with arabidopsis  <cit> . available data suggest that the lineages leading to arabidopsis  and salicaceae  separated  <dig> -  <dig> mya  <cit> . assuming instead that the duplication occurred soon after the divergence of eurosids i and eurosids ii at  <dig> mya yields an estimate of the divergence between salix and populus of around  <dig> mya. considering the uncertainty in the fossil record of salicaceae  <cit>  such a date is perhaps not inconceivable. dating of duplication and divergence events is notoriously difficult due to uncertainties both in the fossil data and substitution rates. acknowledging these uncertainties, our data still suggests that the salicoid genome duplication occurred considerably earlier than previously suggested. in a recent study, the poplar genome duplication was estimated to have occurred  <dig> mya, although it was acknowledged this was an underestimation of the timing due to the much slower substitution rates in poplar compared to other species  <cit> .

our data indicate substitution rates in salicaceae between  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per site and year depending on choice of calibration date, which is close to estimates for conifers , but considerably lower than for annual plants with a reported range of  <dig> -  <dig> × 10- <dig>  <cit> . these results are in line with the generally lower rates of substitutions estimated in perennials as opposed to annuals  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have developed a large number of new snp markers in willow by using the poplar genome sequence as a reference and genotyped them in two large mapping populations. besides providing insights into the evolution of salicaceae genomes, our maps will play a fundamental role in our quest to identify qtls and candidate genes for traits important for biomass production, e.g. growth related traits, resistance to pathogens, drought tolerance and phenology . this is a prerequisite for the advancement of breeding through early marker-based selection. although the genomes of willow and poplar appear well conserved, we have identified several previously unknown genome rearrangements. in addition, we have used a large data set of non-coding dna sequences to estimate substitution rates in salicaceae, which were similar to estimates found in other perennials but much slower than rates found in annuals. a conclusion is that the genomes evolve slowly both at the genomic levels and at the nucleotide level. we have also shown that the salicoid genome duplication must have taken place much earlier than the separation of the two lineages, two events that were previously thought to have occurred within a short evolutionary time. our data also highlights the difficulties in dating ancient whole genome duplication events, and that caution is necessary when using such estimates to draw conclusion about the evolutionary consequences of polyploidy.
