BACKGROUND
cattle have been important to human culture for over  <dig>  years as an agricultural means, for transportation, and as a supply of meat and milk  <cit> . in recent years, studies have been conducted that attempt to increase the productivity of meat and marbling grades by utilizing genetic factors  <cit> , and the results of these studies have been deemed economically significant. the bovine genome is made up of  <dig> autosomes and sex chromosomes with a genome size estimated to be around  <dig>  gbp. because of the economic importance of cows, the bovine genome sequencing and analysis consortium has decoded bovine whole-genomic information  and has reported that a minimum of  <dig>  genes are included in the cattle genome  <cit> . these findings show that bovine genome analysis is becoming increasingly popular.

copy number variation  is an event in which a large dna fragment  is duplicated or deleted. according to recent studies, structural variations that include cnv affect gene expression and are related to the onset of many diseases  <cit> . however, these studies usually focused only on the human genome, while studies of other animals such as cows have been minimal. although a recent study found  <dig> cnvs in three holsteins by array comparative genomic hybridization   <cit> , an analysis that uses many bovine samples to find a way to utilize the cow's genomic character economically is yet to be conducted. moreover, cnvs in genomes exist in low frequency; therefore, it is advisable to analyze many samples in order to find common cnv regions for analysis with various phenotypes. in the case of animal genomes, skinner and colleagues have reported a detailed molecular cytogenetic map as a result of a comparative genomics study in chicken and pekin duck using a cgh microarray  <cit> , and griffin and colleagues also reported  <dig> interspecific cnvs between chicken and turkey  <cit> . as in the case of cattle genome, a recent paper reported  <dig> cnvs discovered using array comparative genomic hybridization  with  <dig> holsteins as samples  <cit> . however, in order to investigate the association between various economically beneficial phenotypes and cnvs, more bovine cnvs would need to be discovered.

two platforms for identifying individual cnvs, acgh and a single nucleotide polymorphism  genotyping array, have been widely used. in the case of the former, signal intensity was varied when comparing the reference and target with the dye-swap method  <cit> . regarding the latter, clustered pool references, signal intensity, and allelic intensity  were used to identify cnv  <cit> . the snp genotyping array has the advantage of performing both whole-genome snp association analysis and cnv analysis  <cit> . this platform also provides various information including mendelian inconsistency , deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium , and genotype missing rate. recent studies have used this advantage to identify common deletion polymorphisms efficiently  <cit> . in addition, accurate and efficient algorithms have also been developed recently that discover cnv not only by means of signal intensity, but also through b allele frequency and family information, and these methods are widely used  <cit> . in order to detect reliable cnvs, we studied multiple factors including signal intensity, b allele frequency, marker distance, and population frequency of the b allele  using penncnv  <cit> .

in this study, we examined  <dig> bovine samples using a snp genotyping array to discover genomic variations that include individual cnvs and common deletion polymorphisms from the whole cattle genome. our goal is to provide genomic variation information that could be used to find economical genetic traits in cattle.

RESULTS
in this study, we used illumina bovinesnp <dig> beadchip and penncnv to identify cnvs in cattle . one sample contained an average of  <dig>  cnvs with an average length and a median size of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb , respectively. after all cnvs were aggregated for the cnv region ,  <dig> cnvrs were identified . the average number of cnvs per sample was  <dig> , with an average length and median size of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively. furthermore,  <dig> cnvrs with > 1% frequency,  <dig> cnvrs with >  <dig> % frequency, and  <dig> cnvrs with > 5% frequency were also inferred from this study. a total of  <dig> genes were included in the identified cnvr . common cnvrs with cnv frequency higher than  <dig> % are listed in table  <dig>  with chr15:1836732- <dig> cnvr having the highest frequency  and chr17:75520590- <dig> cnvr having the highest number of genes. figure  <dig> shows the map of cnvrs discovered from this study. we were also able to detect  <dig> cnvrs that were distributed evenly across the chromosomes. among them, we found  <dig> cnvrs with only gain ,  <dig> with only loss , and  <dig> cnvrs  that share common values.

the sizes of the identified cnvs ranged from 50~ <dig> kb, with a few outliers having a size of  <dig> kb, and most chromosomes had more loss than gain . figure  <dig> shows the result of visual examination by genoplot image within chr15:1836732- <dig> and validation by qpcr. samples representing hemizygous deletion  of the first marker had the same intensity position up to the fourth marker, consecutively . the real copy numbers of samples by qpcr around the third marker  were matched with expected copy numbers on the genoplot image . in addition, most identified cnvs using cnvpartition overlapped with the cnvs detected using penncnv  . to identify common deletion polymorphisms, we used two methods: a heritability error analysis called genotype transmission error, and pairwise analysis. in order to analyze heritability error,  <dig> sire and steer family sets were used. these sets had parent-child heritability frequency that was equal to or greater than  <dig> % and a confirmed parent-child relationship. to calculate for heritability error, we used illumina beadstudio  <dig>  software and detected a total of  <dig> errors. from that, we selected  <dig> parent-child heritability errors whose frequency was equal to or greater than 3% for the purpose of identifying common deletion polymorphisms. figure  <dig> displays a number of identified common deletion polymorphisms for each frequency of father  and child  heritability error. when the number of heritability errors increased, the number of distributed markers decreased. however, there were more common deletion polymorphisms  observed for markers with higher heritability frequency  than for those  with low heritability frequency . following this method, we found a total of  <dig> common deletion polymorphisms. moreover, we were also able to detect  <dig> common deletion polymorphisms by pairwise comparison, analyzing between reference and target samples. merging the identified common deletion polymorphisms from the two methods, we were able to identify a total of  <dig> common deletion polymorphisms, with  <dig> of them common to both methods . common deletion polymorphisms found in this study were distributed from chromosomes  <dig> to  <dig> quite evenly, with chromosome  <dig> having the most and chromosome  <dig> having the least . in order to quantitatively measure for common deletion polymorphisms, we performed qpcr around ars-bfgl-ngs- <dig> in chromosome  <dig>  . as a result, we were able to confirm that the expected copy number changes in each sample, based on visual examination of the genoplot image, existed at those sites .

discussion
cattle are important resources for humans as providers of meat and milk and as labor power for agriculture. lately, interest and research concerning bovine genetic resources are increasing, as evident in the completion of the bovine genome project. however, current studies on bovine cnv, which is an important area of genetic variation along with snps, are very minimal. in the past few years, cnvs have been studied extensively in the human genome, and many human cnvs have been discovered and reported to the dgv . recently, identifying how cnvs in the human genome affect various given phenotypes, including disease susceptibility, has become a major focus for researchers  <cit> . in the animal genome, certain economically useful phenotypes undoubtedly exist. based on the findings from this study, future research might be able to examine the genetic effects of cnv on various economic traits, including beef quality. in order to facilitate such studies, cnvs discovered from each animal should be entered in a database similar to that of the human genome. until now, most cnv researchers have run their association analysis using cnv genotyping according to differences in signal intensity alone. however, cnv is usually linked to nearby snps. just lately, cnv and snp combined analysis has been used. the main advantage of this method is that it can analyze signal intensity and allelic differences simultaneously. in other words, it is possible to do multi-allelic cnv/snp genotyping on cnvs containing multiple snp markers. our previous study reported that after discovering and genotyping multi-allelic cnv markers in the deletion region of the human genome, cnv/snp combined analysis provided more reliable association results than using snp or cnv genotyping alone  <cit> .

in this study, we identified  <dig> bovine cnvs and  <dig> cnvrs. to apply the findings of this study, the common cnvrs we were able to identify will be useful in analyzing certain relationships among phenotypes. for example, a common cnvr provides important genome information for discovering genes related to beef grade and meat productivity. cnv identification was performed using illumina beadchip and algorithm made from btau_ <dig> . if umd <dig> bovine genome assembly was used, more accurate cnv identification result would have been expected. identified cnvrs in this study were validated using visual examination, in which comparison with the results of cnvpartition and qpcr was performed. in figure s <dig> , we demonstrate how this value changes in a region where copy number change appears in a schematic way. for a normal copy number , two homozygous genotypes  and one heterozygous genotype  appear on one genoplot image. on the other hand, a heterozygous genotype , which only emerges in a normal copy number , disappeared in a region where deletion  occurred. this explains why only two lines  were evident. if gain  appears in the genoplot image, there would have been four lines . if b allelic frequency and signal intensity were simultaneously used to discover cnv in the case of deletion and duplication, the identification would be more accurate. to date, the study by liu et al. is the only one regarding bovine cnv identification  <cit> , as far as we know, and it reported  <dig> cnvs from three holstein using array cgh . to compare with previous cnv data on cattle, we converted the coordinates of the  <dig> bovine cnvs with btau <dig>  using the liftover tool in the ucsc database. however, only one cnv overlapped with our results. although it is not easy to decipher this discrepancy, different breeds of cattle and/or a smaller number of animals was used in the previous study.

cnv is defined as a dna fragment higher than  <dig> kb, and copy number variation smaller than  <dig> kb is called an indel. recently, it has been reported that the latest discoveries of cnv sizes were much smaller than the previous results due to the advances made in the chip platform  <cit> . zhang and colleagues have mentioned that the cutoff value of  <dig> kb is completely arbitrary, and they suggest choosing an average exon size  in defining cnv  <cit> . also, venter and watson demonstrated that cnv size distributions show a marked enrichment ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp using whole-genome shotgun sequencing and massively parallel dna sequencing methods  <cit> . although we used a 50k chip for this study, high-resolution methods used for human genome study such as high-density chip or next generation sequencing should be applied to animal genomes, including cattle. for future studies determining the exact cnv boundary, this current study would be valuable in that it could serve as a preliminary report providing whole-genome cnv distribution resources regarding the cattle genome.

indels could affect phenotype and gene expression dosage such as cnv, and may need to be studied further. we developed a method to efficiently discover common deletion polymorphisms among indels, and subsequently identified  <dig> common deletion polymorphisms in this study. figure  <dig> schematically shows the cause of sire and steer heritability error when an snp marker exists within the cnvr. if a deletion occurs on an allele, subsequently it will lead to heritability errors since if a sample exists on the 1× position, the snp genotype becomes a/a  and b/b , as exhibited in figure 4c. using this heritability error, investigation of a region with frequent p-c errors can increase the accuracy and efficiency of identifying the variants. this method is much more effective than the one previously used  <cit> .

gene ontology  analysis can provide insight into the functional enrichment of cnvs. for this reason, we ran go analysis using david http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov provided by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  and nih  <cit> . as a result, we found that genes significantly enriched in the identified bovine cnvs include the cytoplasm, intracellular part, cytoplasmic part, and intracellular organelle. since cnv can influence regions within  <dig> kb, we performed additional enrichment analysis. the gene functions enriched in nearby genes include the multicellular organismal process, regulation of biological quality, and cell morphogenesis . this analysis provides estimated results of expected functions, so additional study of function consequences between actual phenotypes should be carried out.

this study aims to provide genomic resources required for analyzing what economic impact phenotypes and bovine cnvs can bring to the table. in the case of the human genome, the map of identified cnvs presented by redon and colleagues  <cit>  is now used as important information in association studies on various diseases including autism, inflammatory autoimmune disorders, idiopathic learning disability, lung cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus, and schizophrenia. in addition, follow-up studies for high-resolution cnv mapping have been actively occurring. however, cnvs related to economically useful phenotypes are yet to be thoroughly researched, so we expect the results of this study to provide meaningful genomic variation information for related research.

future studies should include additional analysis for accurate size estimation of bovine cnvs and common deletion polymorphisms found in this study, followed by an association analysis of bovine phenotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have identified  <dig> new cnvs and  <dig> common deletion polymorphisms in bos taurus coreanae. these variations were successfully validated using visual examination, mendelian inconsistency, cnvpartition, and qpcr. here, we report the map of bovine cnvs. we expect this result will provide important resources for future bovine genome research.
