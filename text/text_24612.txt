BACKGROUND
inositol-requiring enzyme 1α  is an endoplasmic reticulum  stress sensor activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins. ire1α activation results in the production of xbp1s, a transcription factor, leading to increased expression of genes involved in membrane synthesis, protein folding and protein degradation  <cit> , termed the unfolded protein response   <cit> . this response enables cells to adapt to er stress caused for example by an increased protein load  <cit> . the upr has recently been shown to play an important role in cancer biology, particularly in tumours with a secretory cell origin  <cit> . an example of this is multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells, which produce large quantities of an immunoglobulin or paraprotein. these cells are addicted to the upr to manage the high protein production which would otherwise be toxic. thus, ire1α activity and xbp1s production are thought to be critical to the development and maintenance of the myeloma clone  <cit>  and have therefore been proposed as possible therapeutic targets  <cit> .

ire1α consists of a lumenal stress-sensing domain, transmembrane helix, cytosolic linker domain followed by kinase and rnase domains  <cit> . accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er lumen leads to release of binding protein  from the ire1α lumenal domain allowing dimerisation  <cit> . in yeast, direct binding of unfolded protein to ire <dig> is additionally required for oligomerisation  <cit>  though this is not thought to occur with human ire1α  <cit> . the resulting oligomerisation enables trans-autophosphorylation of the ire1/ire1α cytosolic domain which activates the rnase  <cit> , whose active site is generated by dimerisation  <cit> .

a number of pieces of data support a model where oligomerisation is essential and kinase activity is dispensable for the rnase activity. the requirement for autophosphorylation in yeast and human ire1α can be made redundant by small molecules which bind the kinase atp site in lumenal domain deleted ire <dig> or kinase mutated ire <dig>  <cit> . in vitro studies have also demonstrated that inclusion of the ire <dig> linker domain permits the formation of higher-order oligomeric structures and increased activity, even when the kinase is mutated  <cit> . although the validity of this model is debated as kinase inactivating mutations may or may not lack activity  <cit> . moreover, the linker domain, whose presence is required for oligomerisation, is not conserved between yeast and human, yet human ire1α is also thought to form higher-order oligomers  <cit> .

in this work we sought to address the role of the kinase and the linker domain in human ire1α. experiments expressing ire1α in cells are fraught with difficulty due to spontaneous activation when overexpressed  <cit> . we therefore chose not to use further kinase mutants to study the role of the human kinase, instead, our approach involved using purified ire1α cytosolic domain with phosphatase incubation or atp incubation to simulate the dephosphorylated and autophosphorylated states respectively. we show that dimerisation/oligomerisation of ire1α is sufficient for rnase activity but that phosphorylation of the ire1α cytosolic domain enables rnase activity at lower concentrations. we also show that inclusion of the linker domain enables hyperphosphorylation of human ire1α which further reduces the concentration at which the rnase is active.

RESULTS
concentration dependent oligomerisation of human ire1α activates rnase activity in vitro
previously, partially dephosphorylated or kinase dead yeast ire <dig> has been shown to have an activated rnase following oligomerisation in vitro <cit> . human phosphorylated ire1α has also been shown to have an activated rnase following oligomerisation at high concentrations in vitro and in vivo <cit> . we sought to determine if fully dephosphorylated human ire1α could become rnase active following oligomerisation in vitro.

an ire1α kinase and rnase domain construct encompassing residues g547-l <dig>  designated g <dig> ire1α, which retains kinase autophosphorylation activity  <cit>  was produced in insect cells  and dephosphorylated by treatment with λ-phosphatase. dephosphorylation was confirmed by western blot analysis using an antibody directed at phospho-serine  <dig>  <cit>  , and by mass spectrometry of intact protein .

to test the rnase activity of fully dephosphorylated ire1α, an in vitro fret-derepression assay was developed  <cit>  where cleavage of an internally quenched xbp <dig> splice site mimic leads to increased fluorescence . increasing concentrations of dephosphorylated g <dig> ire1α were incubated with the xbp <dig> splice site mimic and fluorescence was measured. below  <dig> nm no cleavage was detected but increasing g <dig> ire1α concentrations resulted in significant cleavage with an ec <dig> of  <dig> nm and maximal activity observed at  <dig> nm . these results demonstrate, for the first time, that oligomerisation can drive rnase activity of human ire1α cytosolic domain in the absence of phosphorylation.

autophosphorylation enhances rnase activity
in order to determine the role of phosphorylation in regulating rnase activity dephosphorylated g <dig> ire1α was incubated with mg/atp to induce autophosphorylation. phosphorylation was confirmed by western blotting  and mass spectrometry  which showed a tri-phosphorylated protein as the major species. autophosphorylated g <dig> ire1α was then tested in the fret-derepression assay at a range of concentrations . rnase activity was observed at concentrations as low as  <dig> nm, with maximal activity at  <dig> nm and an ec <dig> of  <dig> nm. thus the autophosphorylated form of g <dig> ire1α required substantially lower protein concentration than the dephosphorylated form to activate the rnase by oligomerisation indicating that autophosphorylation enhances rnase activity. indeed, rnase activity is enhanced to the extent that there is a significant concentration window where the phosphorylated form has activity whilst the dephosphorylated form remains inactive.

extension of the linker domain further enhances phosphorylation-dependent rnase activity in vitro
the lysine rich region of the linker domain, critical for enhancement of yeast ire <dig> endonuclease activity  <cit> , is not conserved in human ire1α . to investigate the functional role of the linker region in human ire1α, a construct containing an additional  <dig> amino acids of the linker domain  was produced in insect cells. both dephosphorylated and autophosphorylated proteins were produced to assess their activity. the mass spectrum of λ-phosphatase treated h <dig> ire1α confirmed the absence of phosphate groups, while incubation with mg/atp resulted in the appearance of multiple polyphosphorylated forms  . the presence of the extra phosphorylations compared to g <dig> ire1α is consistent with the serine/threonine-rich sequence of the linker domain .

autophosphorylated h <dig> ire1α had enhanced rnase activity compared to autophosphorylated g <dig> ire1α with activity observed at concentrations as low as  <dig> nm, maximal activity at  <dig> nm and an ec <dig> of  <dig> nm . the dephosphorylated h <dig> ire1α construct had no activity below concentrations of  <dig> nm, maximal activity at  <dig> nm with an ec <dig> of  <dig> nm . this data demonstrates that extension of the linker enables activation of phosphorylated ire1α at lower concentrations. interestingly, despite a lack of conservation between human and yeast linker domains, both play a role in enhancing rnase activity of ire1/ire1α suggesting that the linker domain is important in regulated rnase activity  <cit> .

gst-mediated dimerisation of ire1α enhances rnase activity in vitro
the experiments above demonstrate that ire1α can be activated in the absence of phosphorylation which we hypothesised was caused by concentration-dependent oligomerisation. to test this hypothesis we investigated whether constitutively dimerised g <dig> ire1α would be more active than monomeric g <dig> ire1α. dimerisation was achieved by fusion of the cytosolic domain to glutathione s-transferase  and confirmed by native gel electrophoresis . protein was dephosphorylated and confirmed as before . gst-g <dig> ire1α was incubated with mg/atp to generate the autophosphorylated species, and as for g <dig> ire1α, the gst-g <dig> ire1α was tri-phosphorylated. notably, there was an increase in mass of 2 amu suggesting a disulfide bridge reduction in this protein sample.

in the fret derepression assay, fully dephosphorylated gst- g <dig> ire1α reached maximal activity at much lower concentrations than either phosphorylated or dephosphorylated g <dig> ire1α, with ~70% of full activity achieved at  <dig> nm, the lowest concentration tested, . these data support the hypothesis that human ire1α cytosolic domain can be activated by constitutive dimerisation. however, at low concentrations, phosphorylated gst-g <dig> ire1α had a higher activity than the dephosphorylated gst- g <dig> ire1α indicating that phosphorylation still enhances the activity of a constitutive dimer . two hypotheses can be proposed to explain these results; phosphorylation may further stabilise/enable an rnase-competent dimeric complex of the cytosolic domains. alternatively, phosphorylation may lead to local conformational changes in each monomer that enhance intrinsic catalytic activity. crystallisation of human ire1α with xbp <dig> mrna or with a suitable non-cleavable analogue of xbp <dig> mrna bound is eagerly awaited to confirm these hypotheses.

autophosphorylation enhances stability of ire1α dimers
having shown that dimerisation causes increased activity, we predicted that the increased rnase activity of autophosphorylated h <dig> ire1α relative to dephosphorylated h <dig> ire1α is caused by enhanced stability of dimers in the autophosphorylated state. to test this, we incubated increasing concentrations of fully dephosphorylated h <dig> ire1α and autophosphorylated h <dig> ire1α with the crosslinking agent disuccinimidyl suberate and probed for the presence of monomers and dimers/oligomers by western blot . dephosphorylated h <dig> ire1α was present mainly in monomeric form, with small amounts of dimer at high concentration, whereas autophosphorylated h <dig> ire1α formed dimers and oligomers at the lowest tested concentration of  <dig>  μm. similar results were seen for g <dig> ire1α . taken together with our rnase activity data , these data support a model in which autophosphorylation enhances rnase activity by stabilising the dimeric/oligomeric form of ire1α.

hyperphosphorylation of ire1α is located in the activation loop and linker domain
as h <dig> ire1α is hyperphosphorylated relative to g <dig> ire1α, we proposed that the linker domain of human ire1α may serve as a hyperphosphorylation site for the ser/thr kinase activity of ire1α. to localise the sites of phosphorylation, autophosphorylated h <dig> ire1α and g <dig> ire1α were analysed by tryptic digest mass spectrometry. it was not possible to uniquely assign the phosphorylation sites in all of these peptide fragments due to the density of serine and threonine residues in the linker and activation loop sequences, however, spectra revealed that both h <dig> ire1α and g <dig> ire1α were phosphorylated on the activation loop at residues ser <dig>  ser <dig> and ser729/thr <dig> . phosphorylation at thr <dig> in the rnase domain was also seen, as was a shared phosphorylation site in the part of the linker region common to both constructs at ser548/ser549/ser <dig>  g <dig> ire1α had an additional phosphorylation in the linker domain, not seen in h <dig> ire1α, at thr561/ser <dig>  of the additional phosphorylations present in h <dig> ire1α one double phosphorylation site was located to the extended linker region between s533-s <dig>  six additional phosphorylations were also spread throughout the protein . we speculate that the additional phosphorylations we detected spread throughout the protein may be low level phosphorylations. hyperphosphorylation in the linker may have also occurred but was not detected by mass spectrometry due to the limitations of the technology to detect heavily phosphorylated peptides.

hyperphosphorylation of ire1α also occurs in vivo
to ascertain if hyperphosphorylation of the linker domain was an artefact of in vitro autophosphorylation or relevant in vivo, ire1α was activated in h <dig> myeloma plasma cells using tunicamycin to induce proteotoxic stress. ire1α was immunoprecipitated from cells and subjected to tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry. four phosphorylated peptide fragments corresponding to  <dig> phosphorylation sites were observed. these were located in; the extended linker at s548/s549/s <dig>  the activation loop at both s <dig> and s <dig> and additionally at t <dig> in the c-terminus .

these data demonstrate that hyperphosphorylation of ire1α, particularly in the activation loop and linker domain, also occurs in cells, and confirms that phosphorylations seen in vitro are relevant in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
these data strongly support a model where rnase activity is achieved through dimerisation and clearly show that multiple autophosphorylations enhance the rnase activity of human ire1α in vitro through stabilising dimerisation. in vivo, human ire1α is a transmembrane protein whose stress-sensing luminal domain is negatively regulated by the er-resident chaperone bip  <cit> . in vitro, without the regulatory luminal domain, without hindrance to oligomerisation of the cytosolic domain, stochastic formation of oligomers will increase in line with protein concentration leading to increased endonuclease activity  <cit> . therefore, the systems used in this paper and others do not fully reconstitute the activation process in cells. however, we speculate that results obtained here mimic the behaviour of ire1α when bip is not bound and provide insight to the behaviour of full-length ire1α. based on these data we suggest that the development of ire1α kinase inhibitors could prevent rnase activity and subsequent splicing of xbp <dig> which would be of potential therapeutic use for the treatment of cancer.
