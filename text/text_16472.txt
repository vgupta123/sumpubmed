BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus colonises the nares and skin of approximately one-third of the healthy global population  <cit>  and is responsible for a wide variety of infections both in hospitals and the community  <cit> . the increasing antibiotic resistance of s. aureus has led to the search for alternative drug targets. amongst them, proteins indispensable for cellular viability are optimal candidates. there are currently about  <dig> essential proteins from bacterial genomes used as antibiotic targets encompassing a restricted set of microbial processes, including dna replication and repair, fatty acid and protein biosynthesis, and cell wall synthesis  <cit> . a large number of essential proteins remain to be investigated for novel antimicrobial development.

in a genome-wide study in bacillus subtilis the iptg-inducible pspac conditional expression system was used to determine gene essentiality  <cit> . a subset of  <dig> genes identified in this screening had no significant homology to any gene of known function, and included the well-conserved era/obg family of gtp binding proteins  <cit> . the latter belongs to a diverse superfamily of the often referred to as low molecular weight gtpases, which act as molecular switches in the regulation of crucial cellular processes across all domains of life, including: intracellular and membrane signalling, vesicular transport, cell division, chromosome partitioning, protein targeting and ribosomal function  <cit> .

although very few of the bacterial low molecular weight gtpases have well characterised roles, there is increasing evidence that members of the era/obg family of gtpases are involved in ribosome function, assembly or stability. work on era, obg, yjeq/yloq, ylqf, yphc, and ysxc in e. coli and b. subtilis has indicated associations of these proteins with ribosomal subunits and changes in ribosomal profiles  <cit> . ribosome profiles, created by separation of ribosome constituents on a sucrose gradient, show a decrease in whole  <dig> s ribosomes with an concomitant increase in  <dig> s and  <dig> s ribosomal subunits after depletion of the protein of interest  <cit> .

ysxc in b. subtilis  is an ortholog of the era/obg family of gtp-binding protein that has been reported to be essential in b. subtilis, e. coli, s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and m. genitalium  <cit> . we have previously solved the crystal structure of the b. subtilis ysxc in its open and closed conformations, proven its ability to complex with gdp and gtp, and shown the conformational changes occurring upon nucleotide binding and gtp hydrolysis  <cit> .

a b. subtilis mutant with ysxc under the control of the regulatable pspank promoter has revealed that depletion of the protein led to the accumulation of intermediate  <dig> s subunits  different from those seen upon depletion of similar gtpases yphc and ylqf  <cit> . however, as with ylqf and yphc depletion, intermediates lacked ribosomal proteins l <dig>  l <dig> and possibly l <dig>  other putative ribosomal interacting partners of ysxc have been suggested by wicker-planquart and co-authors  <cit> . ysxc is likely to be essential across eubacteria.

in this study we demonstrate that ysxc of s. aureus localizes to the ribosomes, is crucial for ribosomal stability and is essential for the life of s. aureus.

RESULTS
ysxc is essential in s. aureus
to test whether ysxc was essential in s. aureus, a strain containing a single chromosomal copy of ysxc under the control of a regulatable promoter , repressed by laci and requiring the inducer iptg for expression was constructed as indicated in material and methods . growth of lc <dig>  at several iptg concentrations  was analysed on bhi agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol to ensure maintenance of the laci-containing plasmid . strong growth can be seen on the plate containing  <dig> μm iptg with distinctive single colonies, which are absent on the plate without iptg. the phenotype on solid medium was further confirmed in liquid medium . in a different experiment it was shown that the presence or absence of iptg does not affect growth of the wild type sh <dig> strain , while growth of lc <dig>  is iptg concentration dependent . no distinguishable alterations were observed on ysxc-depleted cells under light or transmission electron microscopy . the number of viable counts on lc <dig> incubated in the absence of iptg remained virtually unchanged, while in the presence of  <dig> mm iptg it increased by  <dig> logs. interestingly, even at  <dig> mm iptg, lc <dig>  had a growth defect when compared to the wild type sh <dig> strain . these results demonstrate that ysxc is apparently essential for growth of s. aureus in these conditions.

to study if the reduction in growth rate seen using the ysxc conditional lethal strain lc <dig>  correlated with a concomitant depletion of ysxc, protein levels after growth without iptg were analysed. as indicated above, cells showed a severe growth defect when iptg was lacking, thus limiting the yield for biochemical analysis. to overcome this, a higher initial inoculum  was used and cultures were grown with choramphenicol and iptg . at this inoculum density, without iptg the growth rate of lc <dig>  was still approximately  <dig> log below that of sh <dig> after  <dig> hours of growth . equal amounts of material purified by ultracentrifugation were analysed by sds-page  and western blotting, probing with anti-ysxc polyclonal antibody . in sh <dig> there is a major ysxc cross-reactive band of ~ <dig> kd and a minor band of ~ <dig> kd, corresponding to a size similar to the predicted molecular weight, i.e.,  <dig> kd. both bands show lower intensity in lc <dig>  grown without iptg. hence, ysxc downregulation is accompanied by a decrease in ysxc concentration in the cell.

purification of ysxc interacting partners
one method used to elucidate the function of a protein of interest is to search for protein partners with which it interacts in the cell. in order to identify proteins interacting with ysxc, the protein was tap-tagged  and an interactive complex purified as described in materials and methods. the resulting proteins were separated by sds page and silver stained .  <dig> distinctive protein bands found in the eluted ysxc complex were trypsin digested and the amino acid sequence of the resulting fragments determined by mass spectrometry. subsequently, a mascot search for proteins in the database containing these sequences was carried out. table  <dig> shows the most probable identity of each of the bands as per its mowse score.  <dig> of the  <dig> bands were identified as proteins from s. aureus, one band was not identified, and four of them  corresponded to preparation contaminants.

 <dig> mowse score = -10*log, where p is the probability that the observed match is a random event. the higher the number, the better the match. individual ions with scores greater than the threshold level  indicates identity or extensive homology .

the band that had the highest probability of a match was band  <dig>  its mowse score for  <dig> s ribosomal protein s <dig> was  <dig> with a threshold level of  <dig>  since  <dig> fragments from this band matched to this protein the identification is highly probable. other bands with high match identities were band  <dig> , band  <dig> , band  <dig>  and band  <dig>  . ysxc, the protein originally tagged, was also identified as a high match band ). all these proteins matched at least  <dig> fragments from the band. for  <dig> parent ions with a score of 95% or better, one can assume that the proteins has been identified.

other interacting bands identified with a score indicative of extensive homology  were bands  <dig> and  <dig>  and corresponded to the dna-directed rna polymerase beta' chain protein and putative elongation factor tu. however, although the former matched  <dig> fragments, the latter, like seca and pflb, were one hit matches, which would require further validation to be considered as legitimate ysxc partners. similarly, bands  <dig> and  <dig> corresponded to casein, a protein not present in s. aureus but a common preparation contaminant.

tap tagging has not previously been reported in s. aureus therefore it was important to eliminate the possibility that any of the proteins identified, corresponded to purification artefacts. an independent purification of an unrelated tap-tagged protein of s. aureus most likely participating in phospholipid metabolism and also purifying with the membrane fraction was carried out . it revealed interactions with proteins also encountered in our search for ysxc partners:  <dig> s ribosomal protein s <dig>  elongation factor tu and aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . although these data do not exclude the corresponding proteins as legitimate interacting partners of ysxc and ynes/plsy, the involvement of these two proteins in different aspects of bacterial physiology suggests the common partners as likely artefacts of the purification procedure. overall, the protein partners resulting from our experiments suggest ysxc as a ribosome-interacting protein.

subcellular localisation of ysxc
the tap tagging experiment identified several ribosome-associated proteins as ysxc interacting partners. to examine the putative association of ysxc with ribosomes, a co-purification experiment was carried out. staphylococcal ribosomes were extracted from other cellular materials by several ultracentrifugation and washing steps, and core ribosomes were depleted of accessory ribosomal proteins by ammonium chloride extraction. equivalent samples from different stages of the purification process were separated by sds-page, western blotted and immuno-detected with anti-ysxc antibodies . ysxc is in the insoluble fraction following the initial ultracentrifugation of a total cell extract  and remains in the insoluble fraction after solubilisation of the membranes with triton x- <dig> . when this insoluble fraction was resuspended in  <dig> m nh4cl, ysxc was solubilised . these results suggest that ysxc is associated with the ribosome but is not a core ribosomal protein.

association of ysxc with specific ribosomal subunits
in order to elucidate the nature of the ysxc-ribosome association, material from s. aureus sh <dig> containing ribosomes was separated by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient. this separates the ribosome into its constituents, i.e.,  <dig> s and  <dig> s subunits, as well as the whole  <dig> s ribosome. the association of ysxc with a particular ribosomal fraction was determined by western blot immunodetection with anti-ysxc antibodies. as shown in figure  <dig> the extract contained the three expected ribosomal fractions and ysxc was primarily located in samples 8- <dig> corresponding to the  <dig> s subunit.

role of ysxc in the ribosome
ysxc may play a role in ribosome assembly, activity or stability. ribosome profiles of wild type and ysxc-depleted cultures were compared. cells from both cultures were broken in the presence of two different buffers: ribosome  buffer and s  buffer. ribosome buffer gives conditions where tightly coupled ribosomes will remain intact whereas loosely coupled ribosomes will dissociate into subunits . in s buffer, the magnesium levels are reduced and the monovalent ions increased which leads to full dissociation of the ribosomes . after breakage, samples were ultracentrifuged and the pellet containing the ribosomes resuspended and loaded onto 10-30%  sucrose gradients in the relevant buffer and centrifuged.  <dig> ml samples were taken from the base of the gradient and tested for rna levels .

the ribosome profile of the ysxc-depleted strain  in associating buffer  shows a change in ratio of subunits  to whole  ribosomes when compared to wild type . the  <dig> s and  <dig> s peaks in the depleted strain were larger than that of the  <dig> s. in contrast, the wild type profile reveals a much larger peak for the whole ribosome than for either of the two subunits. when the ribosome is fully dissociated into its constituent subunits  the levels in wild type and lc <dig>  are virtually identical . however, the peak for the  <dig> s subunits is slightly broader than in the wild type potentially indicating the presence of aberrant  <dig> s subunits.

discussion
conditional lethal constructs based on the replacement of the cognate promoters of chromosomal genes by promoters that can be exogenously controlled have been used successfully to identify essential genes in several organisms. for instance, the pspac promoter was used in the comprehensive genome wide study of b. subtilis, where ysxc was proven to be indispensable  <cit> . identification of essential genes in s. aureus has also taken advantage of this system and a number of them have been identified including genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> , a glycoprotease  <cit>  and a two-component system  <cit> . in this study, we have engineered the chromosomal copy of s. aureus ysxc under the control of pspac. growth of lc <dig>  depended on the presence of the inducer iptg in the medium, thereby proving that ysxc is apparently essential in s. aureus. our results are in agreement with data from an antisense study by forsyth and co-workers suggesting the essentiality of ysxc in s. aureus  <cit> . in the absence of inducer, the strain is unable to form single colonies on plate and only residual growth is detected in liquid medium. the latter is most likely due to the ysxc remaining in the cell at the time of inducer removal and/or the minor leaky nature of pspac also observed in the pspank expression of ysxc by schaefer and co-workers  <cit> . interestingly, even maximum iptg concentrations are unable to restore the growth rate of the mutant to the sh <dig> wild type values. thus, ysxc could potentially be an interesting target for novel drug development.

galperin and koonin cite ysxc in the top  <dig> list of 'known unknowns' of highly attractive targets for experimental study of conserved hypothetical proteins in s. aureus  <cit> . nevertheless, it is extremely important to verify essentiality and analyse gene function in relevant pathogens as not all genes essential in one species maybe so in another.

tandem affinity purification was originally developed in yeast  <cit>  and has been extensively used in other organisms  <cit> , however, not previously in s. aureus. tap tagging of ysxc and subsequent purification indicated interactions with a number of proteins, the majority of which had functions related to or were integral parts of the ribosome. these were  <dig> s ribosomal proteins s <dig> and s <dig>  and  <dig> s ribosomal protein l <dig>  this indicates that the function of ysxc is likely to be related to the ribosome. however, the ribosome is a complex structure and a large number of processes are required for its correct function, including the construction of subunits from ribosomal proteins and rna and the assembly of the subunits into the whole ribosome before the translation process. much of the exact details of these processes and which additional factors are required are unknown. s <dig> and s <dig> are not located together on the assembled ribosome but involved in the later stages of  <dig> s assembly  <cit> . in contrast,  <dig> s ribosomal protein l <dig>  which is localized on the surface of the subunit, binds to 23s rrna, and even after extensive treatment to dissociate proteins can be found in the core of the  <dig> s subunit  <cit> . importantly, b. subtilis l <dig> over-expression in e. coli results in abnormal cell division and nucleoid segregation becoming ultimately lethal  <cit> . similarly, in b. subtilis, a mutation altering l <dig> was reported to cause temperature sensitivity and a sporulation defect  <cit> . interestingly, depletion of ysxc in b. subtilis results in cell elongation, abnormal cell curvature and nucleoid condensation  <cit> . similarly, depletion of yiha in e. coli also impairs cell division  <cit> . importantly, deficiency of other small molecular weight gtpases in various species, including obge in e. coli, and bex in b. subtilis also appear to affect cytokinesis and chromosome partitioning  <cit> . whether these phenotypes are due to the absence of ysxc  or other p-loop gtpases directly impinging on the cell division-related apparatus or a downstream pleiotropic effect remains to be studied. our light and transmission electron microscopy studies of the cellular morphology of s. aureus ysxc-depleted cultures did not reveal a conspicuous deviation from that wild type cells .

recent reports based on the ribosomal intermediates accumulated following ysxc depletion or far-western blotting analysis of purified ribosomal proteins have suggested other ysxc interacting partners in e. coli and/or b. subtilis. a few are essential for viability  while others, although required for optimal growth, are dispensable   <cit> . the l7/l <dig> stalk  has been suggested to participate in 23s rna binding and on the recruitment of peripheral ribosomal factors  <cit> . structural studies on the topology of several proteins including l7/ <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and s <dig> has led to postulate a role for them as rna binders probably stabilizing rrna tertiary structure by fixing the positions of pairs of rrna sequences  <cit> . the possible ysxc contribution to, rna stabilization remains to be determined. although the bulk of l7/l <dig> resides within the  <dig> s region, evidence of its interaction with the  <dig> s subunit, including s <dig> has been provided by cross-linking studies . in addition, immuno-em observations provide supportive evidence for different locations within the ribosome for the l7/l <dig> carboxy-terminal end including the  <dig> s subunit. it is also worth noting that most of the proteins shown to interact with ysxc are well exposed on the surface of the e. coli ribosome: s <dig> , s <dig>  l7/l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  <cit> . thus providing clues as to the location of ysxc within the ribosome.

butland and co-authors found yiha  to associate with itself  <cit> . in our study such interaction would not be detectable as only the tagged copy of the ysxc was present in the chromosome. however, our experimental design enabled us to confirm that the ysxc-tap-tag protein was functional, excluding the possibility of inactive protein artefacts.

the interaction we have observed between ysxc and the β' subunit of rna polymerase, has also been previously reported for obge  <cit> . further work needs to be done to first confirm this interaction in s. aureus and then establish whether it relates to ribosomal or extra-ribosomal functions as reported for l <dig> of b. subtilis  <cit> .

p-loop gtpases, such as ysxc, show an association mainly with one or other subunit of the ribosome. for instance, era and yjeq with the  <dig> s subunit  <cit> , and obg, ylqf and yphc with the  <dig> s subunit  <cit> . we have shown here that ysxc also associates with the  <dig> s subunit, a similar behaviour to its ortholog in b. subtilis  <cit> . since our co-fractionation experiments revealed the interaction of ysxc with proteins from the small and large ribosome subunits, its absence from the  <dig> s fraction could be due to lower affinity and/or stability of ysxc towards its partners in that subunit. the specific role of ysxc and other p-loop gtpases in the assembly or stability of the  <dig> s subunit remains to be determined.

after ysxc depletion, the amount of  <dig> s ribosome decreases with concomitant subunit increase. this could be due to an error in the assembly of the subunits themselves or their assembly into the whole ribosome. as the levels of individual subunits after full dissociation stays approximately the same between wild type and ysxc depleted cells it is possible that the subunits are not being fully assembled. this was observed in b. subtilis where depletion of ysxc results in a number of proteins missing from the  <dig> s subunit, ultimately resulting in the accumulation of aberrant large subunits  <cit> . it has been reported by these authors that ysxc in b. subtilis binds the  <dig>  s preribosomal particle. the depletion conditions used to enable the harvesting of sufficient biomass for ribosomal extraction required some growth of the culture, prior to cessation, which could have partially masked the presence of distinctive intermediates.

ysxc could also act at the level of ribosomal stability; once the ribosome is assembled it may require transient external proteins for stabilization, as it has been postulated for era  <cit> . this could explain the interaction of obge, one of the p-loop gtpases, with both of the ribosomal subunits observed by sato and co-workers in e. coli  <cit> . the dual interaction could be mediated by the presence of ribosomal constitutents modulating ysxc gtpase activity, by gtpases activating proteins  or guanine exchange factors   <cit> , or the intracellular guanine pool  <cit> . however, additional evidence of obge association with the small ribosomal particle is needed since other authors have only reported the co-fractionation of obg homologs with the  <dig> s fraction in e. coli and other species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this article we have successfully used conditional lethal genetic constructs and implemented tandem affinity purification technology in s. aureus to show that ysxc in s. aureus is an apparently essential protein that associates with the large ribosomal subunit and plays a role in ribosomal assembly or ribosomal stability. ribosomal components have been a proven target for successful antibiotics, the elucidation of the role of additional essential and highly conserved ribosomal proteins such as ysxc would open a new avenue to the discovery of novel antimicrobial drugs.
