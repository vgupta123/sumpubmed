BACKGROUND
more than half of the world’s population is colonized with helicobacter pylori <cit> . colonization usually occurs in early childhood and results in disease in about 10% of cases
 <cit> . this disease will in most cases be diagnosed as gastric or duodenal ulcers, while some cases will be diagnosed as gastric cancer
 <cit> .

the human gastric ventricle is the only known natural habitat for h. pylori, and one bacterial strain usually establishes a chronic, lifelong, persistent colonization in one individual
 <cit> . helicobacter pylori has a high level of sequence variation and has therefore been referred to as a quasi-species
 <cit> . natural transformation by exogenous dna
 <cit> , mutations, and recombinations are probably important mechanisms for h. pylori adaption and survival; for example, a variable genome could give advantages in evading the host’s immune system. in spite of the high sequence variation observed in h. pylori,  <dig> core genes have been described that are common to the analyzed h. pylori genomes. the amino acid identities range between 65-100%. among these core genes are housekeeping  genes that are essential for h. pylori survival, and the genetic variability in these genes remains very low
 <cit> . this conservation is reflected in phylogenetic analysis, where hk genes have been used to trace human migration, indicating co-evolution between h. pylori and its host. linz et al. traced h. pylori infection in humans to before their migration from africa through sequence analysis
 <cit> .

analyses of conserved h. pylori genes indicate the evolution of distinct genotypes in different parts of the world. the virulence factor cytotoxin-associated gene a protein, caga, shows biogeographic variation. yamaoka et al. postulated that the geographical differences that are observed in the incidence of gastric cancer could be explained by different h. pylori strains 
 <cit> . caga is injected in the host cell through the type iv secretion system  which is coded by cag pathogenicity island  genes. these genes are also involved in horizontal gene transfer . genes integrated into the h. pylori genome via hgt may have originated from either other bacteria or eukaryotic cells
 <cit> . olbermann et al. <cit>  analyzed the selection pressure for cagpai genes and found that one-third of the genes were under positive selection. most of the genes under positive selection, including the caga gene, code for surface-exposed proteins. in positive selection, mutations increase fitness and, thus, new alleles increase in frequency in the population. in neutral  selection, mutations have no drastic effect on fitness and increase or decrease in frequency by chance. when fitness decreases due to deleterious mutations, new alleles are removed through purifying selection 
 <cit> .

several authors have proposed that the plda gene  is important for the ability of the bacterium to colonize the human gastric ventricle
 <cit> . tannæs et al. <cit>  characterized a classical phase-variation in this gene due to dna slippage in a homopolymeric tract that results in either a complete  or truncated protein . the homopolymeric tract was found in all of the clinical isolates of h. pylori sequenced by tannæs et al. <cit> . the conservation of the homopolymeric tract in this gene through phylogenesis underlines the importance of the gene product and maintenance of the phase variation for this bacterium. this study investigated the evolution of the plda gene in h. pylori. in silico sequence analysis was used to determine whether the bacteria were in the process of preserving, optimizing, or perhaps even rejecting the plda gene. sequences of plda were compared by both identity and phylogenetic analysis to a reference set of hk genes from a large number of isolates sequenced by falush et al. <cit> . horizontal gene transfer prediction was carried out via both intra- and inter-species phylogenetic analysis using related taxa and the estimation of both codon bias and gc content in h. pylori isolates.

RESULTS
caga epiya genotyping
all of the  <dig> korean sequences had an east asian caga abd genotype. nearly all of the  <dig> isolates analyzed from norway had western caga genotypes, with the following distribution: 66% abc, 12% abcc, 12% ab, 4% abccc, and 2% ac. the two isolates collected from patients with east asian origins displayed a caga abd genotype .

amplification of vaca
one norwegian isolate from a patient of north-african origin was vaca genotyped. the sample contained an s1b allele and the m <dig> mid-region type.

bioinformatic analyses of h. pylori plda and seven core housekeeping genes
gene evolution was assessed by comparing h. pylori plda gene sequences to concatenated core hk genes. the average pairwise sequence identity was  <dig> % ±  <dig>  for the plda sequences and  <dig> % ±  <dig>  for the hk genes. the average genetic distance of the plda genes was  <dig> , while it was  <dig>  for the concatenated hk genes.

the phylogenetic reference tree of concatenated hk genes is shown in figure
 <dig>  with a few exceptions, the sequences clustered as expected according to geographic region. in this phylogenetic tree, the majority of sequences were from european isolates. they were separated into two clades by the african and east asian isolates. the east asian cluster could be further subdivided into maorian, east asian, and amerindian sequences. two isolates collected in norway grouped in the east asian subcluster; these patients were of east asian origin. as expected, the remaining two samples originating from norway were found in the european cluster in the reference tree. pecan <dig> was isolated from a peruvian patient and thus initially classified as an amerindian strain, however, it does not cluster with the other amerindians in the east asian cluster as was observed by kawi et al.
 <cit> . two isolates in our tree were described by falush as hpafrica but clustered with european sequences, and both patients were cape colored or mezito, with european ancestors. four outliers were not found in the european cluster
 <cit> . the remaining outliers consisted of two south african samples and one piaroa isolate. the maorian and amerindian sequences formed a subcluster with the highest branch support when increasing the stringency to a 75% bootstrap-value .

the phylogenetic tree based upon the plda gene sequences is depicted in figure
 <dig> . the majority of the korean sequences clustered in the same clade. this cluster contained two isolates sampled in norway that had an east asian caga epiya-abd genotype and came from patients of east asian origin. the four amerindian strains and five east asian sequences from the  <dig> genome sequences were also found in this cluster. one of the samples isolated in norway was from a patient of african origin and clustered with the four african sequences. the vaca genotype of this sample was s1b, the genotype that is most common among the african, spanish, and south american populations
 <cit> . this plda tree was unrooted and consisted of two main clusters, the east asian cluster and the smaller african groups, nested within the vast majority of european sequences. the two african plda sequences from the j <dig> and southafrica <dig> genomes were found among the european sequences, as observed in the reference tree. only three of the african strains formed a clade with 75% bootstrap analysis . 
additional file 1: table s <dig> contain label with corresponding genbank accession id. shown are radial consensus trees of  <dig>  plda  sequences based on  <dig> maximum likelihood bootstrap replicates analyzed in phyml and visualized in figtree . trees were constructed using either the k <dig> + g + i model chosen by modeltest  or the gtr + i + g model  as used to construct the reference tree .

the two plda trees constructed using different models were compared in topd/fmts using split distances. the average split distance was  <dig> , which indicated that the two trees were neither identical  nor completely different . a random split distance was calculated to analyze whether the split distances were significantly different. because the random split distance resulted in a value close to  <dig> , our observations were probably not due to chance.

horizontal gene transfer analysis of plda and ompla sequences
the average gc content of the  <dig> plda gene sequences was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, while the average gc content of the corresponding  <dig> whole-genome sequences was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, a significant difference . the plda mean gc content was greater than  <dig>  standard deviations from the gc genomic mean, suggesting horizontal transfer. we further assessed whether the codon bias found in the plda gene sequences could be due to biological or random effects. the codon adaptation index  was estimated by caical
 <cit>  to be  <dig> , while the ecai estimate was  <dig>  . this yields a cai/ecai ratio of  <dig> ; a cai value higher than the expected ecai value indicates codon bias.

we collected  <dig> ompla sequences , of which  <dig> different species had pairwise sequence identities to h. pylori between 15% and 90%. the vast majority of the protein sequences used in this study were from proteobacteria, with gamma proteobacteria accounting for nearly 72%. in addition to proteobacteria, eight bacteroidetes/chlorobi  species were present. the average length of the ompla protein sequences was  <dig> amino acids , resulting in  <dig> residues in the final alignment. the phylogenetic tree of ompla is shown in figure
 <dig>  the atpa reference sequences had an average of  <dig> residues , and the final alignment contained  <dig> residues. the phylogenetic tree of atpa is shown in figure

adaptive molecular evolution in plda sequences
the swaap analysis resulted in an average ka/ks ratio of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , indicating a protein under strong purifying selection. the codon-based z-test bootstrap analysis confirmed that a vast majority  of the nucleotide sequences had a high probability  of being under purifying selection.

 <dig> depicts the results of the test for positive selection in paml. the two models that allowed positive selection, m <dig> and m <dig>  fit our data better than the models, m <dig> and m <dig>  that did not. the lrt showed that the m <dig> model best fit these data. this model estimated that fourteen sites  were under positive selection , with ω =  <dig>  and  <dig> % were under purifying selection, with ω <  <dig> . the m <dig> model estimated that  <dig> % of the sites were under purifying selection, while  <dig> % was positively selected. paml estimated κ ≈  <dig> for m <dig> and m <dig> 

nested models with and without positive selection  were compared in paml. the χ <dig> distribution column shows the minimum likelihood ratio  necessary for the more complex of two models to be significantly better .

paml predicted that  <dig> sites were under positive selection  using bayes empirical bayes analysis for the m <dig> model. one asterisk  signifies a probability >95% that ω > <dig>  while two asterisks  signify a probability greater than 99%. the best ancestral reconstruction is indicated by the highest value in the final posterior probability column.

discussion
brok et al. compared ompla protein orthologs from eleven different species and concluded that ompla contained  <dig> highly-conserved residues. the fact that ompla is present in a wide range of species, including h. pylori, and that the sequence is conserved across those species, strongly indicates that its physiological role is significant
 <cit> . this study aimed to better understand the significance of plda, the gene coding for ompla, in h. pylori; an important gut bacterium in humans.

the h. pylori plda gene had a low degree of variability and, thus, a conserved ompla protein sequence alignment. housekeeping genes are essential for bacterial survival, and are thus highly conserved. the seven hk genes, atpa, efp, ppa, tphc, urei, trpc, and muty, and the plda gene are among the core genes that are found in all h. pylori genomes sequenced to date
 <cit> . the average sequence identity was higher in plda and the molecular distance was lower than in the hk genes. the present study focused on analyzing plda gene sequences that code for functional ompla proteins. in previous studies, we showed that most clinical isolates contain these coding pldaon sequences
 <cit> . in this study, we included  <dig> isolates from a norwegian population used in the sørreisa study
 <cit> . most  of these isolates showed an on phase variant, indicating that the gene encodes a functional ompla protein in most individuals. the homopolymeric tract induces a shift between a functional and a truncated protein by enabling a frameshift mutation. wernegreen et al. postulated that selection will purge nucleotide changes that could interrupt the slippery tract, to maintain otherwise volatile sequences
 <cit> .

why the plda gene in h. pylori contains a homopolymeric tract is an enigma, and we explored whether its existence could be part of a gene deletion process or perhaps a mechanism needed to prevent activation in certain environments. the homopolymeric tract corresponded to residues 226– <dig> in the translated ompla protein. residue  <dig> was the most downstream site that was predicted to be under positive selection in this protein. the remaining twenty percent of the protein  is under purifying selection, indicating functional constraints and implying that the protein is important to bacterial survival.

genes under purifying selection are often involved in host-pathogen interactions. for example, purifying selection in orthopoxvirus is probably caused by host defense mechanisms
 <cit> . however, pathogens must also evolve novel residues to evade the host immune system, resulting in positive selection on some residues
 <cit> . such positive selection has been shown in the flagellum-coding gene fla, which is involved in adhesion in aeromonas; nearly the entire protein was under purifying selection, while  <dig> residues were subject to positive selection
 <cit> . our analyses demonstrated purifying selection in most of the plda sequence, while the remaining residues were predicted to be under positive selection. the positively-selected sites were scattered throughout the ompla protein. petersen et al. concluded that positively-selected sites are exclusively located in the loops of outer membrane proteins
 <cit> . in rickettsiaceae, positively-selected sites were important for host-parasite interactions and were located at the exterior of the proteins
 <cit> . the e. coli ompla structure had a beta-barrel transmembrane conformation
 <cit> . thus, one might reasonably assume that its positively-selected sites are also within surface-exposed regions. the n-terminal end of the protein contained four positively-selected sites , but they are most likely a signal sequence and not part of the mature protein.

bacterial survival and persistence in the gastric mucosa requires adapting to an environment with constant fluctuating ph. helicobacter pylori adjusts to ph fluctuations in the stomach by regulating the expressions of niche-adapted genes such as urease and ferric uptake regulator , which protect against acidity by producing ammonium and modulating the expression of many genes under acidic conditions, respectively. both genes are required for survival under acidic conditions. fur mutants do not colonize well and are probably killed by environmental conditions in regions other than the final colonization sites, like in the mucus layer. the exact mechanism still remains unclear
 <cit> . because the plda gene is required for growth at low ph
 <cit>  and active ompla protein is important for survival in acidic environments
 <cit> , the gene may be part of the acidic environment niche-adapted mechanism described. helicobacter pylori ompla is an outer-membrane protein that is exposed to the continuously changing environment of the host, so its interactions should be optimized. this could cause some of the residues to be under positive selection pressure while the rest of the protein is conserved and is typically observed in proteins that are in the process of adapting to environmental changes
 <cit> .

helicobacter pylori has demonstrated geographical clustering of its hk, virulence, and outer membrane protein genes in phylogenetic studies
 <cit> . because many genes with biogeographic patterns are highly conserved, we were interested in determining whether plda gene sequences showed such partitioning. as a point of reference, we constructed a phylogenetic tree with the same sequences used by falush et al.
 <cit> . we found biogeographic patterns in both the reference hk and plda gene trees; however, bootstrap values in both trees, indicates relatively weak support for the biogeographic clades perhaps due to the high sequence identity found in both alignments. the strongest clade found in the plda tree  contained three out of the four african h. pylori. however, one of the african isolates in the original analysis was not found in this clade. thus, the african cluster could be due to the fact that the data were taken from same patient over many years
 <cit> .the hk reference tree contained sequences from around the world . the majority of the amerindian samples clustered in the east asian cluster, as reported for other genes
 <cit> . however, although sjm <dig> is from a native american peruvian isolate, it clustered with the european isolates, as described by manjulata et al. <cit> . the two samples in the east asian subcluster were of east asian origin and had an east asian caga genotype. the majority  of the east asian plda sequences contained two mutations . in future work, we would like to assess whether and how these two mutations influence ompla structure and function.

the phylogenetic trees were constructed to analyze the biogeography of the plda sequences. in the process, we discovered that the best-fit substitution model for the plda sequences was different from that of the hk genes. this indicates that the genes have not evolved under the same conditions and could be explained by hgt of the plda gene. the k <dig> algorithm adjusts for transition to transversion  bias which was also confirmed with a high ts/tv rate ratio  in the plda dataset. we constructed two phylogenetic plda trees, using the two models selected for reference and plda, to determine how the model would affect the geographical clustering. this would give insight into how plda sequence evolution compares to that of the housekeeping genes. the hk reference genes represents the core genome diversity within h. pylori as they are scattered around the genome, flanked by conserved genes not expected to be under any immune selection
 <cit> .the two trees were found to be quite different, with a split distance ratio of  <dig> . our findings were most likely due to biological effects rather than random bias. interestingly, the only biogeographical difference observed between the two models was in the placement of the american j <dig> isolate, which had african characteristics
 <cit> . this sequence was found in the european cluster in the plda k <dig> tree, while it clustered with the other african sequences in both the hk and plda gtr trees. these analyses could indicate that the genes have co-evolved along different phylogenetic lines for a long time and that a possible hgt event involving plda may have occurred relatively early in the evolution.

our hypothesis of hgt was confirmed through both intra- and inter-species evolutionary analyses. multiple analyses can infer hgt, including phylogenetic analysis of orthologs and estimates of codon bias and gc content. our results indicated an ancient transfer, because the plda tree had a similar biogeographical pattern to that of the reference tree. the ompla protein is mainly found in gamma proteobacteria. horizontal gene transfer has been observed in, e.g., the cagpai region, which has a lower gc content than the rest of the h. pylori genome
 <cit> . the current study demonstrated a possible hgt event through the analysis of phylogeny, gc content, and codon bias. the gc content of the plda sequences was slightly but significantly elevated compared to the rest of the h. pylori genome, and the difference was well above the accepted mean deviation threshold
 <cit> . although the h. pylori genomes as a whole lacked codon bias
 <cit> , further analysis was needed to ensure that the plda gene was an exception to this conclusion. the cai confirmed that the observed codon bias was most likely due to biological effects rather than artifact. thus, the codon bias in the plda gene suggested horizontal transfer
 <cit> . further confirmation for hgt was found in the phylogenetic analysis comparing ompla and atpa sequences in which helicobacter differed from the other epsilon proteobacteria. in particular, h. pylori and h. acinonychis were the two most divergent species in the ompla phylogenetic tree. these results were validated using an approximate likelihood ratio test in phyml
 <cit> . the phylogenetic tree of ompla conflicts with that of atpa, indicating multiple hgt events. the species found outside of their expected clusters might have adapted quickly to environmental changes as a result of hgt events, which accelerate the rate of adaption
 <cit> . this is illustrated in the epsilon cluster; three of the four non-epsilon bacteria in that clade colonize humans either as pathogenic bacteria or as part of the intestinal microbiota .

CONCLUSIONS
the plda gene in helicobacter pylori has high nucleotide sequence identity due to purifying selection at the vast majority of residues. the result is a conserved h. pylori protein that likely has an evolutionarily stable function, although some probable interaction sites are subject to positive selection. although hgt was detected by codon bias, gc content, and phylogenetic analysis, the biogeography of the plda sequences indicated that the transfer was ancient. the protein structure of h. pylori ompla will yield a better understanding of the positively selected sites, which may be surface-exposed regions. our analyses indicated that plda may be a niche-adapted protein; it was horizontally acquired, is highly conserved, but positive selection occurs at sites needed for possible pathogenic interactions.
