BACKGROUND
it has been recently reported that major pathogens staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa exploit acceleration of syndecan  ectodomain shedding as a mechanism of host damage and thus increase their virulence  <cit> . approximately 1% of cell surface proteins are thought to be shed into the extracellular environment by host cells as a process of normal cell surface turnover  <cit> , however during the infectious process shedding can reach pathological proportions. the diverse list of proteins, which are normally shed from the cell surface includes but is not limited to cytokines, growth factors, and cell adhesion molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor , transforming growth factor α , epidermal growth factors , l-selectin, cd <dig>  and synds .

synds are a group of four distinct proteoglycans , containing transmembrane core proteins modified with several heparan sulfate  and chondroitin sulfate chains. synd <dig> is the major hs pg of epithelial cells, which binds and regulates a wide variety of biological molecules through its hs chains  <cit> . syndecans act as adhesion molecules, modulators of growth factor function, and co-receptors in processes as diverse as morphogenesis, tissue repair, host defense, tumor development, and energy metabolism. in mammary epithelial cells synd <dig> co-localizes with actin filaments thus anchoring the cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix. synd <dig> can be found in the focal adhesion junctions between cells  <cit> . therefore, synds are involved in modulation of cell spreading, adhesion, motility and maintenance of intercellular contacts. ectodomain shedding rapidly changes the surface phenotype of affected cells and generates soluble, biologically active ectodomains that can function as paracrine or autocrine effectors. a growing body of evidence indicates that these molecular and cellular features enable ectodomain shedding to regulate many pathophysiological processes, such as microbial pathogenesis, inflammation, and tissue repair  <cit> .

shedding of syndecans can be abnormally increased in the case of the infectious process. the p. aeruginosa shedding enhancer was identified as lasa, a known metalloprotease virulence factor  <cit> . studies in vivo indicate that p. aeruginosa activates synd <dig> shedding to enhance its virulence in a murine model of lung infection  <cit> . shedding enhancers of s. aureus are represented by pore-forming α-toxin and sphingomyelinase β-toxin  <cit> . during the infectious process, proteolytic removal of ectodomain in a soluble form by secreted microbial factors could enhance host colonization by altering the morphology and compromising the integrity of protective barriers formed by polarized epithelial cells of the skin, the surfaces of body cavities and internal organs, as well as endothelial cells lining blood vessel walls. the initial pathology can be further aggravated by exposing intercellular, basolateral, and subepithelial adhesive components to bacterial factors  <cit> . structural damage to the host cell surface with resulting insult to protective barriers caused by ectodomain shedding along with pathological signaling can initiate a mechanism ultimately leading to the malfunction and failure of life-critical organs and systems.

inhalation anthrax is a systemic disease characterized by severe damage to epithelia residing in major internal organs such as the liver, lung, intestines, spleen, and kidneys. disruption of vasculature resulting in massive hemorrhages and pleural edema is a hallmark of systemic anthrax  <cit> . the b. anthracis genome contains genes for several proteolytic and hemolytic factors, which are structurally similar to the shedding inducers from p. aeruginosa and s. aureus, including among others the s. aureus α- and β-toxin homologues: anthralysin o  and anthralysin b , respectively  <cit> . another anthrax hemolytic factor of interest regarding its potential activity in ectodomain shedding is anthralysin a , which is 99% homologous to its b. cereus counterpart, cereolysin a   <cit> . johansen et al.  <cit>  reported that nih 3t <dig> cells stably transfected with the gene encoding clna displayed a transformed phenotype. exogenously applied clna decreased cell-cell contacts and increased cell migration  <cit> . despite these observations the ectodomain shedding has never been studied with regard to infections caused by b. anthracis or b. cereus. therefore, the main goal of this study was to test our hypothesis regarding the shedding activity of b. anthracis hemolytic proteins and to demonstrate that synd ectodomain shedding takes place in response to anthrax infection.

in addition to the hemolysins our attention was attracted to the lethal toxin , a major anthrax virulence factor  <cit> . the mediator of its toxicity remains unknown. it has been shown that lt abrogates intracellular signaling through proteolytic cleavage of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases   <cit> . administration of lethal doses of a purified lt to mice and rats causes pleural edema  <cit>  indicating that lt compromises the integrity of intercellular contacts maintaining the fluid homeostasis in the lung. it has been previously suggested that lt is capable of increasing vascular permeability  <cit> , and recent experiments with endothelial cells in culture are consistent with this conclusion  <cit> . therefore, we wanted to test whether lt can function as a shedding inducer, and whether the inhibition of mapkks by lt modulates cell signaling relevant to shedding.

in the current study, we report characterization of the isolated anthrax hemolytic proteins anlo, anlb, as well as the anla homolog clna from b. cereus, regarding their synd shedding and barrier permeability-enhancing activities. we found that lt also stimulates synd <dig> shedding  by the mechanism which involves the mapkk signaling pathways. overall, our observations identify a novel strategy of anthrax virulence factors, which among their diverse biochemical activities stimulate the host cell stress responses ultimately leading to activation of the ectodomain shedding. in connection with these observations we also demonstrate that synd <dig> shedding occurs during the infectious process in the b. anthracis  spore-challenged mice. the elevated levels of shed synd <dig> are readily detectable in the circulation just  <dig> h post challenge. this new feature of the anthrax infectious process could be of high pathogenic significance. we suggest that a cumulative effect of several virulence factors on ectodomain shedding could compromise the integrity of host protective barriers, cause malfunction of major organs, and ultimately contribute to the pathological systemic response typical in anthrax patients.

RESULTS
hemolytic factors and lt increase ectodomain shedding from normal murine mammary gland  epithelial cells
shedding activity of isolated recombinant proteins identified by us as candidate shedding inducers was tested using nmumg epithelial cells. this murine cell type represents a commonly used model in similar studies  <cit> . synd <dig> is abundant on the epithelial cells and can be assayed using antibodies specific to the corresponding core proteins or the hs chains. using immunodetection with antibodies specific for synd <dig> core protein we tested nmumg cell culture supernatants for the presence of soluble synd <dig> in the assay conditions when highly charged hs chains are selectively retained by the blotting membrane. we found that all tested hemolytic proteins, namely anlo, anlb and clna, as well as lt cause a concentration-dependent acceleration of synd <dig> release into culture supernatants albeit at significantly different amounts . the time course of synd <dig> release in the case of anlo shows a fast increase in the amount of shed synd which continues for several hours . the lt causes increase in synd <dig> shedding, although the effect of lt is of lower intensity and develops slower compared to anlo. the individual components of lt, the protective antigen  and the lethal factor  do not induce shedding . this suggests that neither the extracellular enzymatic activity of lf nor the sole pore-forming capacity of pa is directly responsible for shedding.

analysis of cell viability in the shedding experiments reveals a marginal to small degree of the lactate dehydrogenase  release from treated cells compared to untreated ones. there is no obvious correlation of cell death with the amount of shed synd <dig>  which allows us to conclude that the processes of shedding and cell death are not directly related to each other but rather take place concomitantly, depending on the nature of the pathogenic factor and other treatment conditions. for example, treatments with either clna or anlb presented in fig.  <dig> are not cytolytic, while the amounts of shed synd <dig> in both cases increase 8-fold. anlo increases cell death 3-fold , while there is an 11-fold increase in synd <dig> shedding. in the case of lt, incubation for  <dig> h leads to a  <dig> -fold increase in cell death , while the amount of shed synd <dig> increases almost 3-fold. the above conclusion agrees with direct microscopic observation of treated monolayers displaying live cells with partially or completely shed synd <dig> detected by fluorescently-labeled anti-synd <dig> antibodies . we did not explore this topic further, however available data show that the e-cadherin shedding preceded apoptosis in enterocytes  <cit> , while in endothelial cells lt compromised the barrier integrity  independently of apoptosis or necrosis  <cit> . stimulation with the phorbol ester, pma, a known inducer of shedding  <cit> , prolonged viability of epithelial cells  <cit>  and predisposed monocytes to apoptotic death caused by lt  <cit> .

in order to confirm the biochemical identity of shed synd <dig>  the following experiment has been carried out. western blot of nmumg cell supernatants after treatment with either anlo, anlb or lt using anti-mouse synd <dig> antibody demonstrates a high molecular mass smear band that can be attributed to the presence of heterogeneous heparan sulfate glucosaminoglycan chains in shed synd <dig> . indeed, digestion of the supernatants with heparanase ii and chondrotin sulfate abc lyase leads to the appearance of a single band corresponding in gel mobility to the core synd <dig> protein, which typically migrates in a gel as an approximately  <dig> kd band  <cit> .

immunostaining of the nmumg monolayers with fluorescently-labeled antibodies against e-cadherin and synd1
we examined the nmumg cells grown on glass slides using immuno-fluorescence microscopy. after challenge with proteins causing synd <dig> shedding the cells were fluorescently stained using e-cadherin- and synd1-specific fitc-conjugated monoclonal antibodies. e-cadherin is a major transmembrane component of the apical junctional complex. in a simple polarized epithelium the junctional complex consists of tight junctions and underlying adherens junctions playing a key role in the formation and maintenance of epithelial barriers  <cit> . we therefore wanted to see if the process of synd ectodomain shedding observed in our experiments is accompanied by the loss of intercellular contacts reflected in the dissociation of the junctional complex. our analyses revealed obvious cytopathogenic changes in treated nmumg cells. in all cases, a network of e-cadherin visible in untreated confluent cells becomes either disorganized, damaged or disappears from intercellular contacts upon treatment , similar to what has been reported for ve-cadherin in endothelial cells treated with lt  <cit> . partially confluent nmumg cells demonstrate intensive synd <dig> staining along the perimeter of cells, which partially or completely disappears from cell surfaces after incubation with the shedding-inducing proteins, while remnants of the ectodomain remain visible in the intercellular space . notably, the treated cells retain a high intensity of dapi blue fluorescence typical for undamaged nuclei, indicating that the loss of e-cadherin and synd <dig> takes place from viable cells.

inhibition of synd <dig> release
the ectodomain shedding of cell surface molecules is typically mediated by host metalloproteinase sheddases  <cit> . both constitutive and accelerated shedding are inhibited by a variety of substances active in a number of receptor- and stress-activated signaling pathways, which involve protein tyrosine kinases , protein kinase c , and mitogen-activated protein kinases   <cit> . the activity of lt in macrophages and epithelial cells has been previously reported to involve down regulation of mapk kinase cascades  <cit> .

the results of inhibition experiments are presented in the table. it shows that piceatannol, a specific inhibitor of the syk family of ptks  <cit>  is active in both spontaneous and induced synd <dig> shedding for all tested proteins. in the case of anlo and lt at low concentration of  <dig>  μm the inhibitor shows some stimulatory effect on both constitutive and induced shedding, but it strongly inhibits synd <dig> release in concentrations typical for its activity range of  <dig> to  <dig> μm  <cit> . the effect of piceatannol suggests that all four factors stimulate signaling pathways, which most probably involve cytoplasmic syk, however piceatannol has also been reported to inhibit other tyrosine kinases in a similar concentration range. in agreement with the above suggestion the inhibitor of src ptk family pp <dig> is completely inactive . a general ptk inhibitor tyrphostin a <dig>  shows only a weak activity. the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor ly <dig> is inactive with all tested proteins, and we conclude that the cell survival pathway mediated by this kinase is irrelevant to shedding.

suramin is a multi-potent therapeutic  <cit> , which among other activities displays an antitumoral effect by blocking the growth factors binding to several receptors, including the ones for epidermal growth factor , platelet derived growth factor , insulin growth factor ii, and transforming growth factor-β . these growth factors bind to heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans, which can be shed in various pathophysiological processes, such as wound repair, and microbial infections  <cit> . most importantly, suramin modulates activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases  involved in cell adhesion, integrin signaling and cell cycle progression  <cit> . among these, ptp1b and cdc25a are inhibited by suramin in the low μm range. the drug activates ptpα and ptp lar at higher concentrations. because of low bioavailability, the suramin concentration above  <dig> μm has to be used for the activation effect  <cit> . the table shows that similar to piceatannol, suramin stimulates shedding at  <dig> μm. at higher concentration, suramin effectively inhibits synd <dig> shedding in nmumg cells induced by lt and anlo. this effect is consistent with the inhibition-activation pattern of suramin activity toward ptps, but the multi-potency of suramin excludes its clear interpretation without additional studies. shedding activities of lipases clna and anlb are insensitive to suramin at all concentrations tested.

in order to understand which signaling pathways among p <dig>  erk and jnk are involved in lt-mediated acceleration of synd shedding, we tested sb <dig>  an inhibitor of p38; pd <dig>  an inhibitor of mek1/ <dig> ; and the jnk inhibitor ii. while both anlo and lt induce synd <dig> shedding, lt on itself is a known inhibitor of mapk signaling. in contrast, anlo was reported to stimulate p <dig> in macrophages  <cit> . we found that the p <dig> inhibitor in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> μm decreased synd <dig> shedding in nmumg cells induced by either anlo or lt to the level of spontaneous shedding observed in cultures without treatment, but it is inactive with clna and anlb. the inhibitor of erk pathways pd  <dig>  behaves similar to sb <dig> with anlo, but it is less effective in the lt-induced shedding. the only statistically reliable effect of the jnk inhibitor is the slight increase in spontaneous shedding from untreated cells. none of the tested inhibitors is toxic to cells in the conditions of the inhibitor experiments  indicating that activity of tested inhibitors is not dependent on their cytotoxic effect.

collectively, the inhibition experiments demonstrate that b. anthracis pathogenic factors induce synd <dig> shedding through different signaling pathways, which seem to converge on activation of cytoplasmic ptks. among tested proteins, one can preliminarily identify two groups of shedding inducers. the first one includes lt and pore-forming anlo influencing mapk pathways, which are commonly activated in response to receptor stimulation and stress, while the other consists of membranolytic lipases clna and anlb.

erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> phosphorylation patterns in nmumgs treated with anlo or lt
since both pd <dig> and sb <dig> influence the anlo- and lt-induced synd <dig> shedding, erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> phosphorylation patterns were studied in more detail. fig.  <dig> shows that, compared with untreated cells, within several minutes the anlo causes a strong transient erk1/ <dig> activation lasting for more than  <dig> h in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml anlo. a lower concentration of anlo causes a shorter period of activation followed by a slight increase in signaling after  <dig> h. the latter is present in both control and treated cells and probably reflects a distress caused by incubation in low fcs media. the p <dig> phosphorylation reaches maximum intensity after the erk1/ <dig>  in the same conditions, lt also causes transient activation signals but its effect on the amounts of activated erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> is different from that of anlo: the up-regulation of erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation is detectable at the  <dig> min time point and then completely disappears within  <dig> min. while the transient peak of p <dig> activation is detectable at  <dig>  μg/ml of lt, its level remains lower compared to anlo. as a control, lt  boiled for  <dig> min is inactive in mapk activation . it seems that the enzymatic cleavage of mapkks by lt is an important factor reducing the intensity of signaling.

anthrax lt and hemolytic factors compromise epithelial barrier permeability
after our findings demonstrated the fact of accelerated synd shedding, it was important to test if the latter is accompanied by changes in barrier permeability. we used a primary culture of human small airway epithelial cells  grown on collagen-coated membranes with the pores permeable to dextran blue  <dig>  which was used as an indicator of barrier integrity  <cit> . the membranes separated the lower and the upper chambers of the culture wells, thus mimicking the barrier represented in the lower airways of the lung. the cells were challenged by adding anlo, clna or lt in the upper chambers for  <dig> h. after treatment, blue dextran  <dig> was added to the upper chambers for  <dig> h. the changes in barrier permeability were evaluated by measuring the optical absorbance of blue dextran  <dig> in the lower chambers, in comparison with untreated cells. fig.  <dig> shows that the anlo and clna cause intensive shedding of synd <dig>  in these experimental conditions the lt challenge does not induce shedding and therefore serves as a negative control. the effect of lt becomes detectable only after the  <dig> h . in general, the hsaecs display the pattern of sensitivity to anlo, clna and lt similar to that of the nmumg cells. as expected, the treatment with anlo and clna causes a strong increase in barrier permeability  correlating with shedding. this suggests a possible causal relationship between the two processes, which needs to be elaborated in further studies.

anthrax infection in mice is accompanied by acceleration of synd <dig> shedding
the experiments with recombinant proteins described above suggested that synd shedding could also take place during anthrax systemic infectious process. to confirm this hypothesis the dba/ <dig> mice were challenged with b. anthracis spores of the toxigenic sterne strain intraperitoneally as described before  <cit> . blood samples were drawn, and serum was tested similar to culture supernatants of protein-treated cells using immunoblot with the antibody against synd <dig> core protein. the assay shows a several-fold increase in the amount of shed synd <dig> on the next day post challenge . elisa protocol with the same antibody demonstrates similar results, when diluted serum samples are used to coat the assay plate wells . a high level of circulating ectodomain is sustained until two days post-infection. a calibration curve obtained with a control serum spiked with different concentrations of recombinant synd <dig> allows estimate that average blood synd <dig> concentration at day  <dig> post challenge is increased by  <dig> μg/ml.

in the conditions of the experiment, about 50% of animals die at day  <dig>  and all animals die by day  <dig> post challenge. the onset of death on day  <dig> is accompanied by a decrease in the amount of released synd <dig>  which could be explained by a number of mechanisms, such as degradation of syndecan core protein resulting in the loss of its immunoreactivity with antibodies and a reduced retention of the protein on the surface of the assay membrane or plate. in any case, the abnormal release of synd <dig> into circulation of infected mice directly indicates that the pathological acceleration of synd <dig> shedding takes place in vivo at systemic level and is accompanied by the processes of its biochemical turnover.

discussion
acceleration of ectodomain shedding represents a part of an adaptive response of the host cells to different stress factors and injury such as g protein-coupled receptor agonists, growth factors, cytokines, osmotic stress, wounding and phorbol ester activation  <cit> . however the functional significance of the ectodomain shedding in microbial pathology is uncertain: it could either promote pathogenesis, cellular defenses or both. microbial membrane-damaging factors and other toxins can disturb cell homeostasis and serve as strong inducers of stress proceeding through activation of signaling pathways ultimately resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements and increase in barrier permeability  <cit> . although the cytoskeletal rearrangements and synd <dig> ectodomain shedding are closely interconnected  <cit> , a direct link between stress response, synd <dig> ectodomain shedding and barrier dysfunction has never been demonstrated for bacterial toxins.

initial evidence that b. anthracis toxins can disrupt host epithelial and endothelial barriers is available from early anthrax publications. for example, smith et al.  <cit>  using lt produced in vivo identified vascular damage and renal failure as a consequence of its activity, while smith and stoner  <cit>  demonstrated that lt induced an increase in vascular permeability. these observations agree with the fact that the most damaged organs in the infectious process are the ones with high epithelial and endothelial cell content such as spleen, lungs, liver, renal system, vasculature of blood and lymphatic vessels. a recent report by warfel et al.  <cit>  confirmed that lt can increase the endothelial barrier dysfunction independent of necrosis or apoptosis. the lt preparations used in early studies were crude, so we took into account a possibility that pathogenic factors other than lt could have played role in the observed effects. a spectrum of these factors includes  cytolytic lipases and pore-forming toxins  <cit> , and proteases of different specificity  <cit> .

our experiments demonstrate that bacterial secreted factors, such as pore-forming toxin anlo, and cytolytic lipases clna and anlb accelerate the normal process of host cell synd <dig> and e-cadherin ectodomain shedding, which is as a proteolytic mechanism of releasing them in a soluble form  <cit> . the effects of anlo and anlb are similar to what has been previously reported for their biochemical analogs, staphylococcal α- and β-toxins, respectively, in a similar concentration range  <cit> . we further show that the process of synd <dig> shedding is accompanied by loss of epithelial barrier integrity of hsaecs in culture. the abnormal level of shed synd <dig> in the blood of spore-challenged mice suggests that anthrax secreted factors could compromise epithelial barrier integrity at the early stages of the disease.

the full spectrum of proteins shed in anthrax requires further studies. our preliminary data  indicate that different combinations of shedding factors could produce synergictic effects. biologically relevant concentrations of anthrax shedding inducers in tissues, organs and body fluids are unknown, and therefore the assessment of each protein's contribution to ectodomain shedding in vivo is currently impossible, but the capacity of b. anthracis to produce hemolytic proteins, in addition to lt, has been demonstrated in both aerobic and anaerobic culture conditions  <cit> . the antibodies against these proteins are also detectable in serum of mice challenged with b. anthracis  spores . in our experimental conditions the release of synd <dig> and e-cadherin takes place within several hours, and high levels of shed synds are detectable after  <dig> hours post infection with spores . this observation opens a possibility of using shed ectodomain release into circulation for early detection of the anthrax infectious process. maximal synd release coincides in time with the appearance of bacteria in the spleens of challenged animals tested in our previous experiments  <cit> . bacteria became detectable in the spleens at approximately  <dig> h post infection, reached maximum numbers at about  <dig> h and then declined before death.

normally, es is mediated by metalloproteinases, which are collectively called sheddases or secretases. our data agree with the host sheddase modulation mechanism demonstrated by others  <cit> , because metalloproteinase inhibitors such as galardin and phosphoramidon reduce shedding induced by anlo , which has no enzymatic activity on its own. other anthrax proteins, clna and anlb are not proteases, and therefore cannot shed synd <dig> by direct proteolysis on the cell surface. lt is a metalloprotease but induction of synd <dig> shedding requires lt delivery into the host cell, in agreement with the extracellular cleavage of the synd <dig> core protein by cellular sheddase. the fact that proteins of an absolutely different nature, such as proteases and lipases of distinct enzymatic specificities along with pore-forming toxins possessing no catalytic activity, display similar effects with regard to synd <dig> shedding indicates activation of a common intracellular mechanism by diverse extracellular signals. indeed, the activity of piceatannol against shedding by all tested inducers suggests that cytoplasmic syk ptk serves as the common point of convergence. this mechanism however retains a certain level of specificity judging by the fact that neither pa nor lf induces shedding.

the mapk-mediated pathways have been previously implicated in receptor-induced ectodomain shedding  <cit> . it has also been reported that anlo stimulated the p <dig> signaling in macrophages  <cit> . our data show that the inhibitors of erk1/ <dig>  and p <dig>  decrease the anlo- and lt-induced shedding. this effect agrees with the mechanism recently discovered for the hydrogen peroxide-stimulated cytoskeletal reorganization in endothelial cells  <cit> . it has been shown that both of the above inhibitors attenuated mapk-mediated activation of the small heat shock protein hsp <dig> downstream from erk1/ <dig> and p <dig>  this protein is responsible for the actin stress fiber polymerization, which accompanies synd ectodomain shedding  <cit> . we however cannot conclude which of the mapk pathways plays a predominant role in shedding.

currently available data suggest that the p <dig> pathway defends against bacterial pore-forming toxins in vivo and in vitro  <cit> , therefore the p38-mediated shedding could represent a protective cell response to stress . in agreement with this, kevil et al.  <cit>  reported that p <dig> inhibitor attenuated the oxidant stress fiber formation and prevented generation of gaps between endothelial cells. warfel et al.  <cit>  found that p <dig> inhibitor increased the endothelial barrier resistance, although concluded that this effect was somewhat paradoxical given the ability of lt, as known inhibitor of mapk signaling, to decrease barrier resistance. we suggest that lt plays a dual role upon interaction with the host cells by inducing both the cellular stress and the inhibition of mapk activation. the intricate combination of both processes results in the reduction of the transient stress signal, which nevertheless remains sufficient for the induction of shedding but reduces the potency of lt as shedding inducer. in support of this, our data show that lt induces small but detectable activation of p <dig> even at high lt concentration. in contrast to lt the pretreatment of cells with the effective p <dig> inhibitor is expected to completely block the stress signal and the consequent shedding. transient p <dig> activation has never been reported in connection with lt activity although lt-induced erk1/ <dig> activation has recently been described as toxin-induced lt resistance in macrophages  <cit>  in a lower concentration range compared to our experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings provide additional insights into the studies of b. anthracis virulence factors, such as lt and hemolytic proteins, at cellular and organism levels, where shedding has to be taken into account as a new anthrax pathogenic mechanism. it could rapidly change cell surface properties and increase barrier permeability by the concerted effect of several pathogenic factors contributing to dissemination of infection, hemorrhages and edema. shedding generates biologically active ectodomains that can function as paracrine or autocrine effectors  <cit> . the shed soluble proteoglycans are highly hydrated and this effect is expected to exacerbate edema by causing influx of water into the intercellular space. it has already been shown that shed synd <dig> is toxic to mice  <cit> , and that inoculation of synd <dig> ectodomain restored sensitivity of synd-/- mice to p. aeruginosa  <cit> . these findings suggest high pathological significance of synd shedding in the anthrax infectious process, which needs to be further addressed in animal experiments.
