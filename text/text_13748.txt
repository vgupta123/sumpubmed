BACKGROUND
stress fibers are bundles of actin microfilaments formed in cells following integrin-mediated attachment and spreading  <cit> . regulation of these contractile fibers is critical for cell adhesion and motility. the microfilaments within stress fibers are held together by specialized bundling proteins, such as myosin and α-actinin, which can interact simultaneously with two actin filaments. these classical actin-bundling proteins have been studied extensively leading to a basic understanding of their interaction with actin filaments and regulation of stress fibers. one important discovery was the periodic and alternating association of myosin and α-actinin which is clearly visualized as a beaded pattern along stress fibers in cells stained for immunofluoresence microscopy  <cit> . although it is not understood how this alternating association of myosin and α-actinin with the microfilaments is regulated, it is critical for the contractility of the stress fiber. in addition to myosin and α-actinin, actin stress fibers are decorated with numerous other proteins, associated either directly or through interaction with other actin-binding proteins. determining the function of these ancillary proteins is important for understanding the regulation of stress fibers.

modulation of the actin cytoskeleton by lim domain proteins is an active and growing field of research  <cit> . lim domains are cysteine-rich sequences of 50– <dig> amino acid residues that contain two tandem zinc fingers  <cit> . several lim proteins have been demonstrated to interact with and/or regulate α-actinin. vallenius et al.  <cit>  have reported that reversion-induced lim  protein associates with α-actinin increasing its binding to actin filaments in vitro and may alter actin stress fibers in various cell types. four and a half lim domain protein  <dig>  has been demonstrated to disrupt actin stress fibers in c2c <dig> myoblasts presumably by binding to actin filaments and inhibiting α-actinin bundling  <cit> . in addition, enh  <cit> , alp  <cit> , cypher  <cit> , clim <dig>  <cit> , clp- <dig>  <cit> , zyxin  <cit> , and the cysteine-rich protein  family  <cit>  have also been demonstrated to interact with α-actinin, although it is not clear if these proteins influence α-actinin function.

the crp family, which includes crp <dig>  crp <dig>  crp <dig>  and the thymus lim protein , is a subgroup of lim domain proteins containing two lim domains linked to short glycine-rich repeats  <cit> . crps are highly conserved between species with crp <dig> from human, chicken, and quail having an amino acid sequence identity greater than 90%  <cit> . although the crps have different patterns of expression, evidence suggests that they are functionally similar  <cit> . crps are important for cell differentiation presumably by modulating protein-protein interactions involved in transcriptional regulation  <cit> . outside of the nucleus, crps clearly localize to focal adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton, and have been postulated to play a role in controlling these structures  <cit> .

crp <dig>  crp <dig>  and crp <dig>  have all been shown to bind α-actinin  <cit> . interaction between the two proteins was first reported for crp <dig> using affinity chromatography, solution and solid-phase binding assays, and co-immunoprecipitation from cell lysates  <cit> . a follow up study demonstrated that α-actinin could interact equally with crp <dig>  crp <dig>  and crp <dig>  <cit> . in addition, it was determined that the crps were interacting with the actin-binding domain of α-actinin  <cit>  and the α-actinin-binding site was mapped to amino acid residues 62– <dig> of human crp <dig>  <cit> . based on the binding assays and co-localization within the cell, it was proposed that the interaction of crp with α-actinin was responsible, in part, for its localization to the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . recently, grubinger and gimona  <cit>  demonstrated that crp <dig> binds directly to actin filaments and suggested that crp <dig> does not interact with α-actinin. we have found that there are two populations of crp <dig> associated with actin stress fibers, one interacting with α-actinin and one that appears to interact directly with the actin filaments. although, crps have been shown to bind to α-actinin and actin filaments, it is not clear how these proteins regulate the actin cytoskeleton. in this study, we show that crp <dig> regulates actin filament bundling by directly cross-linking actin filaments and stabilizing the interaction of α-actinin with actin filament bundles.

RESULTS
expression of crp <dig> increases f-actin bundling in refs
to determine the influence of crp <dig> on the actin cytoskeleton, rat embryonic fibroblasts  were transfected with increasing concentrations of dna encoding cfp-crp <dig> resulting in increasing levels of expression of the fluorescent fusion protein . expression of cfp-crp <dig> was observed in approximately 15% of the cells with levels ranging from 2– <dig> fold that of endogenous crp <dig> . consistent with immunostaining for endogenous crp <dig>  and previous reports  <cit> , cfp-crp <dig> was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm, along the actin cytoskeleton, and in the nucleus of some cells . these results suggest that the cfp tag does not significantly affect the function of the crp <dig> protein. although the morphology of the refs was unaffected, expression of cfp-crp <dig> appeared to increase the bundling of actin microfilaments . if the expression of cfp-crp <dig> was resulting in increased actin filament bundling, then cfp-crp <dig> would be expected to redistribute to the triton x- <dig> insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. as shown in fig. 1a, insoluble cfp-crp <dig> increased with expression. in addition, an immunoreactive band migrating below cfp-crp <dig> was recognized, presumably a proteolytic fragment. the distribution of actin and α-actinin in the triton x- <dig> soluble and insoluble fractions were also examined. however, with a transfection efficiency of only 15%, a significant change in the insolubility of actin and α-actinin was not detected .

crp <dig> bundles f-actin independently of α-actinin
since crp <dig> has been demonstrated to bind to α-actinin  <cit> , we proposed that crp <dig> was regulating actin filament bundling by increasing α-actinin bundling activity. in order to test this hypothesis, α-actinin bundling activity was examined in the absence and presence of crp <dig>  for these experiments , actin filament bundling was determined using a sedimentation assay with  <dig>  μm α-actinin alone,  <dig>  μm crp <dig> alone,  <dig>  μm α-actinin +  <dig>  μm crp <dig> , and  <dig>  μm α-actinin +  <dig>  μm crp <dig> . although, crp <dig> did not appear to influence the bundling activity of α-actinin, we did find that when crp <dig> was added to α-actinin bundled actin filaments, a 2-fold increase in α-actinin was observed in the bundles . these results suggest that crp <dig> was stabilizing the interaction of α-actinin with the actin filaments in the bundles.

we also found that crp <dig> alone could bundle actin filaments in a concentration dependent manner . furthermore, crp <dig> bound to the actin filaments more efficiently than α-actinin, 75–90% compared to 35–45%, under all of the experimental conditions . to confirm that crp <dig> was bundling the actin filaments, the bundling assay was carried out on glass coverslips and the proteins fixed with 3% formaldehyde followed by staining with rhodamine-phalloidin . images of the samples clearly show that crp <dig> induced the formation of actin filament bundles similar to that of α-actinin.

two populations of crp <dig> are associated with actin stress fibers
previous reports have suggested that crp <dig> is localized to actin filaments through interaction with α-actinin  <cit> . since the above results demonstrated that crp <dig> could directly bind to and bundle actin filaments, we asked if crp <dig> was actually binding to α-actinin along actin stress fibers within the cell. refs were co-transfected with dna encoding cfp-crp <dig> and yfp-α-actinin. as in previous experiments, approximately 15% of the cells expressed the tagged proteins with greater than 90% of these cells expressing both proteins. in cells fixed with 3% formaldehyde in pbs using standard protocols, yfp-actinin was observed in its classical beaded pattern along actin stress fibers and within focal adhesions . cfp-crp <dig> was also observed in focal adhesions and along actin stress fibers; however localization along the stress fibers was continuous and not beaded like that of α-actinin . cells were also fixed with 3% formaldehyde in triton x- <dig> buffer in order to remove the soluble cytoplasmic proteins and proteins weakly associated with the cytoskeleton. using this fixation protocol, cfp-crp <dig> was observed to co-localize explicitly with yfp-α-actinin along actin stress fibers and in focal adhesions . scatter plots are shown in fig.  <dig> to represent localization of the two proteins in the images. for the unextracted cell, the distribution of fluorescence intensity for the two tags is diffuse as a result of the areas in the cell where the two proteins are not co-localized, with a correlation coefficient of r =  <dig> . for the extracted cell, the co-localized populations of the two proteins are represented by the characteristic comet shaped scatter plot with a correlation coefficient of r =  <dig> .

although we had clearly identified a population of crp <dig> that co-localized with α-actinin, this did not prove that the two proteins were interacting directly with each other. an established method for determining the interaction between two localized proteins in a cell involves fluorescence resonance energy transfer  microscopy. in these experiments, we followed the method for photobleaching fret  described by karpova et al.  <cit>  using refs co-expressing cfp-crp <dig>  and yfp-α-actinin . for this method, the fret efficiency is determined by measuring the dequenching of the donor emission after selective photobleaching of the acceptor  <cit> . in cells fixed with 3% formaldehyde in triton x- <dig> buffer, we consistently observed an increase in cfp emission along actin stress fibers following photobleaching of the yfp . as a control, the cfp emission on a similar region which was not photobleached was also measured. the histogram in fig. 6e shows that the distributions of the fret efficiencies for the photobleached regions  was shifted positively compared to the unbleached control regions  with the mean ef significantly different from the control ec . for comparison, the fret efficiency for a cfp-yfp fusion protein was reported as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the photobleached regions compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the unbleached control regions  <cit> .

crp <dig> localizes to dynamic actin structures
α-actinin is not only localized to stress fibers and focal adhesions, but also to more dynamic actin structures such as the membrane ruffles of spreading and pdgf treated cells. thus, if crp <dig> cross-links actin filaments and stabilizes the interaction of α-actinin with actin filaments, localization to membrane ruffles would also be expected. previously, we have shown that platelet-derived growth factor  stimulates the relocation of α-actinin to membrane ruffles  <cit> . in order to determine if crp <dig> would relocalize with α-actinin, refs co-expressing yfp-α-actinin and cfp-crp <dig> were stimulated with pdgf for  <dig> min followed by fixation in triton x- <dig> buffer. images of the two proteins clearly show that cfp-crp <dig> is co-localized with α-actinin in the membrane ruffles of pdgf treated cells . experiments were also carried out with co-expressing cells showing the co-localization of crp <dig> and α-actinin to the membrane ruffles of refs during cell spreading .

discussion
crp <dig> is a lim domain containing protein which has been demonstrated to localize in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, along actin filaments, and in focal adhesions. recent studies have shown that the nuclear population of crps mediates protein-protein interactions regulating transcription and differentiation <cit> . although crps have been found to bind to α-actinin, zyxin, and actin filaments, little is known about how crps regulate the actin cytoskeleton. in this study, we examined the regulation of actin filaments by crp <dig> in vitro and in cultured cells.

expression of crp <dig> in fibroblasts resulted in increased actin filament bundling . in addition, we found that crp <dig> directly binds to and bundles actin filaments . crp <dig> has recently been reported to bind actin filaments  <cit> ; however, this is the first study to show that any crp can bundle actin filaments.

after observing an increase in actin filament bundling in the cells expressing cfp-crp <dig>  we expected to find that crp <dig> was enhancing the bundling activity of α-actinin. however, in vitro bundling studies clearly demonstrated that crp <dig> had no influence on the ability of α-actinin to bundle actin filaments . furthermore, these results showed that crp <dig> and α-actinin do not compete for binding to actin filaments and therefore must bind at different sites. interestingly, approximately twice as much crp <dig> protein pellets with the actin filament bundles compared to α-actinin. the significance of these findings is not clear, but may reflect differences in the mechanisms by which crp <dig> and α-actinin bind and bundle actin filaments. further studies are necessary to determine how crp <dig> is bundling actin filaments.

although α-actinin had previously been demonstrated to bind and presumably localize crp <dig> to actin filaments  <cit> , the new evidence that crp <dig> could directly bind and bundle actin filaments prompted further investigation. detergent extraction of cells has long been used to improve examination of the cytoskeleton. previously, we demonstrated that triton x- <dig> extraction removes soluble cytoplasmic proteins leaving behind an intact cytoskeleton with associated adhesion and matrix proteins <cit> . extraction with triton x- <dig> has also been used to separate and define adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins based on stable association with the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . triton x- <dig> extraction of fibroblasts co-expressing cfp-crp <dig> and yfp-α-actinin allowed us to differentiate two populations of crp <dig> along actin stress fibers . the triton x- <dig> resistant population of crp <dig> co-localized with α-actinin along stress fibers, whereas the less stable triton x- <dig> susceptible population appeared to represent crp <dig> which was directly associated with actin filaments. furthermore, confocal microscopy demonstrated that cfp-crp <dig> and yfp-α-actinin were in close enough proximity for fret between the cfp and yfp . since the tags need to be within ~50Å for efficient fret to occur  <cit> , the results indicate that crp <dig> and α-actinin are bound to each other along actin stress fibers.

CONCLUSIONS
evidence from this and other studies suggests that the different populations of crp <dig> mediate protein-protein interactions unique to each cellular compartment. nuclear crp <dig> regulates interactions between transcription factors <cit> . cytoplasmic crp <dig> modulates the actin cytoskeleton by two mechanisms: 1) stabilizing α-actinin interaction with actin bundles and 2) cross-linking actin filaments. further studies are needed to determine how the different populations of crp <dig> coordinate to modulate the function of the cell.
