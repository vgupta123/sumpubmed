BACKGROUND
vitamin a and its active form, retinoic acid  play an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, morphogenesis and organogenesis during vertebrate development  <cit> . ra is involved in embryonic cell patterning, myogenic differentiation, chondrogenesis, central nervous system development and cardiovascular development  <cit> . ra regulates gene expression by binding specific nuclear transcription factors, retinoic-acid-receptors  and retinoid-x-receptors , which interact with cognate promoter sequences, retinoic acid response elements   <cit>  in target genes.

the cardiovascular system is the first functioning system to develop in the vertebrate embryo. at various stages during avian embryogenesis the defects in cardiovascular development can be caused both by a deficiency or an excess of vitamin a  <cit> .

during a short time span during avian embryonic development, at the hamburger and hamilton stage  <dig>  or at the 4– <dig> somite stage , ra is indispensable for heart morphogenesis and for the survival of the avian embryo  <cit> . in the absence of vitamin a at this critical developmental window, morphogenesis of the posterior region of the primitive heart is impaired, the newly developing inflow tracts  close inappropriately, and the sino-atrial tissue fails to differentiate  <cit> . vitamin a-deficient  embryos die by day four of development with gross abnormalities in the developing heart and central nervous system. the abnormal development can be prevented by the administration of all-trans-ra to the vad embryo during or prior to the critical ra-requiring developmental window at the 4– <dig> ss of embryogenesis  <cit> .

the transforming growth factor beta  superfamily is a large group of multifunctional, structurally related cytokines that are major regulators of normal growth and development in multi-cellular organisms  <cit> . expression of tgfβs and their cell surface receptors is universal and widespread throughout development. tgfβ canonical signaling pathway involves the intracellular mediators smads  <cit> , although alternative options, e.g. the mapk/erk pathway, have also been identified  <cit> . tgfβs are expressed in three isoforms, tgfβ <dig>  tgfβ <dig> and tgfβ <dig>  each having specific, non-overlapping roles in cellular functions  <cit> . tgfβ <dig> is most strongly linked to heart morphogenesis  <cit> . tgfβ2-null mice exhibit cardiac, lung, craniofacial, limb, eye, ear and urogenital developmental defects  <cit> .

tgfβ <dig> is expressed early in chick embryogenesis. at the 3– <dig> ss, it is localized in the notochord, neural tube and splanchnic mesoderm, the developmental progenitor of the heart forming regions  <cit> . later in embryogenesis, tgfβ <dig> is expressed in the heart inflow tracts during the early looping stages, in the atrio-ventricular canal and in the heart outflow tract  <cit> . tgfβ <dig> is required to secure epithelial-mesenchymal transition during the development of endocardial cushions  <cit> .

regulation of tgfβ signaling by ra is well documented  <cit> . depending on the cell type, ra can either induce or repress tgfβ expression  <cit> . recent in ovo studies with quail embryos demonstrated that ra signaling is required for the normal development of the avian heart ifts and that tgfβ <dig> is involved in this ra-regulated event. this was evidenced by the observation that in the absence of ra tgfβ <dig> was over-expressed in all embryonic cell layers, suggesting that ra acts as a negative regulator of tgfβ <dig> synthesis during embryogenesis  <cit> . similarly, elevated ectopic tgfβ <dig> protein accounts for the heart septation defects and abnormalities in the outflow tracts of ra receptor mutant mice  <cit> . since the tgfβ <dig> gene does not have ra response elements  <cit> , the mechanism of regulation of tgfβ <dig> by ra is expected to be indirect and warrants further investigation.

the aim of this research was to develop a reliable in vitro model for the study of ra-regulated tgfβ <dig> expression during early vertebrate heart morphogenesis. studies of transgenic mice with knock-outs or mutations of the rars have provided important information about the role of tgfβ <dig> in ra-regulated events during advanced stages of heart formation, but have not addressed the role of this important growth regulator in the critical early events of heart morphogenesis. using an in vitro chicken embryo heart-forming region  cell culture model we provide new insights into the role of tgfβ <dig> during the initial molecular events of heart building.

in order to obtain a better understanding of tgfβ <dig> function during early cardiovascular development as well as to expand the application of the model, we examined several genes known to be ra-regulated during embryonic cardiovascular development and also linked to tgfβ <dig>  vascular endothelial growth factor  was a gene of great interest, since in vivo work has shown that the formation of the endothelial linkage of the heart to the primordial vasculature is an integral part of the early heart building events and that this process is ra-regulated and indirectly linked to tgfβ <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are known to be ra-regulated and thus likely involve vegf-a  <cit> . another ra-regulated gene is fibronectin   <cit> , an extracellular matrix component essential for many morphogenesis events and a prominent component of the interface between the endoderm and mesoderm of the hfr, thus involved in building the embryonic cardiovascular system. additionally, it has been reported that fn is a target of tgfβ signaling pathway  <cit> . similarly, neogenin  is known to be induced by tgfβ signaling  <cit> . this multifunctional developmental protein was initially studied in neurogenesis  <cit> , but recent studies have shown it to be an important regulator of organogenesis in the embryo  <cit> . furthermore, neo is a receptor for the bone morphogenesis proteins   <cit> . since bmp- <dig> is regulated by ra during in ovo heart morphogenesis  <cit> , the above observations warranted an examination of potential links of neo to the ra-regulated heart morphogenesis.

in this paper we describe the development of a chicken embryo hfr cell culture to obtain insights into ra-regulated tgfβ <dig> signaling during the initial stages of heart morphogenesis under conditions where the concentration of ra is easily modified and ra is the only modulator during the growth of the culture. the model will allow the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction by tgfβ <dig> as well as of other important genes involved in ra-regulated early heart morphogenesis.

RESULTS
development of chicken hfr explant and cell culture model
explants of the hfr  tissue from 1– <dig> ss embryos were obtained after  <dig> to 42 h incubation of freshly fertilized eggs at 37°c and placed in separate wells on 24-well plates. dmem/10% fbs medium was used to propagate all types of adherent cells; endo-grow medium was used to promote growth of endothelial lineage cells. contractile cardiomyocytes  were observed after 24 h of cultivation in both media, although the development of contractile tissue in dmem medium was less efficient in comparison to that in endo-grow.

after one day of incubation, the formation of contractile tissue from the 1– <dig> ss explants was greater in the endo-grow medium as compared to that grown in dmem medium . the greatest amounts of contractile cardiomyocytes were formed when explants from 3– <dig> ss embryos were cultured in endo-grow medium. the capacity of explants to develop contractile tissue diminished significantly using later stage embryos.

the total number of explants placed in culture media is shown in parentheses. *percentage of explants forming contractile tissue aggregates within 24 h of cultivation. experimental details are described in methods.

in rt-pcr assay, hfr cells from explants  of 3– <dig> ss embryos were grown in endo-grow media and gave strong intensity bands for the mrnas of the vegf-a, cardiac transcription factors gata <dig> and nkx <dig>  genes, all known to be involved in cardiovascular morphogenesis. hfr cells grown in dmem produced weak bands for vegf-a and nkx <dig>  and no bands for gata <dig> transcripts .

homeobox gene  is involved in early development of vertebrate embryos and is regulated by ra both in vitro <cit>  and in vivo <cit> . hoxb <dig> has ra response elements within its promoter sequence and thus is a direct ra target gene  <cit> .

when ra was added to the medium, hoxb <dig> gene mrna expression increased  <dig> times and  <dig> times in endo-grow media supplemented with  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm ra, respectively .

effect of exogenous ra on tgfβ <dig> gene and protein expression in cultured hfr cells
chicken hfr cells were grown in dmem and in endo-grow media supplemented with exogenous ra at a concentration of  <dig> nm . tgfβ <dig> mrna synthesis was also decreased in the presence of exogenous ra. in dmem media the accumulation of tgfβ <dig> transcripts was reduced by approximately 35% with both ra concentrations; in endo-grow media tgfβ <dig> transcripts were reduced by 40% at  <dig> nm ra and by 60% at  <dig> nm ra in comparison to controls without added ra .

effect of exogenous ra on the expression of tgfβ/smad regulated genes and on vegf-a mrna synthesis
the expression of fn <dig>  neo and vegf-a genes characterize the development of extracellular matrix, neuronal tube and vascular endothelium, respectively, within the embryonic tissue. all these processes contribute to heart morphogenesis. the expression of fn <dig> and neo genes is known to be up-regulated by tgfβ through the smad signaling pathway in human fibroblast culture  <cit> . if in the chicken primary hfr cell cultures these genes were to function as in the human fibroblasts, then the addition of ra, known to down-regulate tgfβ <dig> in the avian embryo  <cit> , would also cause a decrease in fn and neo expression. however, there was a statistically significant increase in fn <dig> mrna in hfr cells when cultivated in either dmem or endo-grow medium in the presence of exogenous ra . in contrast, neo mrna expression in hfr cells decreased in the presence of exogenous ra , paralleling the down-regulation of tgfβ <dig> expression observed earlier . this response was most pronounced in cells cultured in endo-grow medium, where neo mrna concentration decreased to 51% and 34% of the mrna levels observed in controls cultured without ra supplementation. neo gene expression in cells grown in dmem in the presence of exogenous ra resulted in a slight decrease at  <dig> nm ra, while the decrease at  <dig> nm ra was not statistically significant.

vegf-a mrna expression in the hfr cells cultured in dmem with  <dig> nm ra or  <dig> nm ra was increased by 42% and 78%, respectively in comparison to controls without supplemented ra. the effect was even more pronounced when the cells were cultured in endo-grow medium, as there was a 135% increase in the vegf-a mrna expression with  <dig> nm ra and a 235% increase in the presence of  <dig> nm ra .

discussion
there have been many studies on the role of retinoids in vertebrate heart development  <cit> , however only a few have addressed early heart morphogenesis during physiologically relevant conditions  <cit> . the present study for the first time offers a biologically significant and valid in vitro primary cell culture model from early stage chicken heart forming regions  that can be used to study vertebrate molecular mechanisms regulated by ra under conditions that closely mimic early events of vertebrate in vivo heart morphogenesis. the model is based on the published in ovo observations that in the avian embryo the requirement for ra begins at the 4– <dig> somite stage  of neurulation  <cit> ; this is also the time when heart morphogenesis is initiated and when the presence of ra is absolutely essential for normal embryonic development to take place  <cit> .

since vertebrate early heart development is comparable across species, the avian embryo offers an ideal model to study this most important early developmental event. to offer an alternative to the in vivo model for studies of retinoid function during early stages of heart morphogenesis, our strategy was to utilize the knowledge obtained from the in ovo studies to produce an in vitro model that could mimic the in ovo model system. we accomplished this goal by isolating hfr cells from 3– <dig> ss normal chicken embryos and culturing them under conditions that generate tissue characteristics and biological responses in the presence of retinoic acid. it is important to note that for the in vitro system described here it is critical to harvest the hfr tissue during the narrow 3– <dig> ss developmental window, as pointed out above.

we established that the cultured cells exhibited the expected characteristics of heart tissue, i.e. forming contractile tissue after 24 hr of growth in culture , expressing the cardiogenic gene nkx <dig> , the cardiogenic transforming factor gata <dig> and the vascular endothelial growth factor vegf-a . next, it was important to verify the responsiveness of the cultured cells to the vitamin a-active form, retinoic acid . although the endo-grow medium that was chosen for culturing the cells contained  <dig>  nm ra, this level is significantly lower than the physiological level of ra reported for the normal early avian embryo, i.e.  <dig> nm  <cit> , thus the expression of some ra-regulated genes may be weak in these cultures; the addition of  <dig> nm ra would be close to the physiological level of the early avian embryonic cells.

to ascertain that the chicken hfr cell culture is indeed a valid in vitro model for the elucidation of ra-regulated molecular events during early vertebrate embryogenesis, we modulated the expression of hoxb <dig>  a direct ra target gene  <cit> , in response to the presence of ra in the culture media  and verified that the cell culture represents a reliable system for the proposed studies.

having established a viable and valid in vitro heart forming cell culture model for studying ra-regulated heart morphogenesis, we next examined in this model the expression of some of the genes that had been reported to be regulated by ra during early in ovo heart morphogenesis  <cit> .

we focused on tgfβ <dig> because it is intricately involved in ra-regulated early heart morphogenesis and shares many global regulatory characteristics with ra  <cit> . furthermore, endogenous ra is a critical negative in vivo regulator of tgfβ <dig> during avian embryogenesis. tgfβ <dig> mrna and protein concentrations are increased in the vitamin a-deficient  quail embryo, and supplying a physiological amount of ra to the vad embryo decreases and thus normalizes the expression of tgfβ <dig>  <cit> . in line with the reported in ovo observations  <cit> , the presence of  <dig> or  <dig> nm ra in hfr cell culture caused a decrease in tgfβ <dig> mrna and protein concentrations in the cultured cells . this finding provides evidence that the chicken hfr cell culture is a valid biological model to further examine the interrelationship between ra and tgfβ <dig> during early vertebrate heart morphogenesis.

since tgfβ <dig> gene promoter region does not have ra response elements  <cit>  which are required for a direct regulation by ra via its rar/rxr complexes, an indirect mechanism must be involved. the expression of tgfβ <dig> is governed by two ap- <dig>  two ap- <dig>  two sp <dig>  and four cre binding sites located in the promoter of this gene  <cit> . an indirect regulation of tgfβ <dig> by ra might be achieved by ra affecting one or more of these binding sites. it is known that the ra/rar/rxr complex can bind to ap- <dig> blocking its activity to induce tgfβ <dig> expression  <cit> ; discussed in  <cit> . recent studies of amniotic cell membrane explants show that the ra/rar/rxr complex can also interact physically with the transcription factor sp <dig> preventing it from binding to its site in the tgfβ <dig> promoter  <cit> . clearly, further analysis of the interactions of tgfβ <dig> promoter elements and dna binding proteins in vitro are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of ra-regulated tgfβ <dig> expression during embryogenesis.

in preliminary studies with adult chicken heart cells and human heart cells isolated from the heart biopsies, we did not observe any effect on tgfβ <dig> gene expression when the ra concentration in the media was either increased or decreased . this is likely due to differences in ra/tgfβ <dig> regulatory interactions in embryonic and adult cells, reflecting epigenetic changes during development. dna methylation at cpg sequences may differentially affect the binding of the transcription factors involved in the regulation of tgfβ <dig> expression, e.g. ap- <dig> binding might be blocked  <cit> , ap- <dig> binding might be stimulated  <cit> , and cre binding may be blocked or modified  <cit> . these observations emphasize the need for adequate model systems to study tgfβ <dig> expression at specific stages of development.

studies with quail embryos have shown that when the early embryo is retinoid deficient, tgfβ <dig> is overexpressed in all cell layers in the anterior part of the embryo  <cit> . thus, these ectopically elevated tgfβ <dig> levels could adversely affect many of its target genes. it was therefore important to examine ra-regulated developmental genes that have also been linked to tgfβ in other cells. one of the genes examined was fn, regulated both by ra  <cit>  and tgfβ/smad  <cit> . another gene of interest was neo, a multifunctional developmental receptor linked to embryonic organogenesis  <cit> . in human fibroblast cell culture fn <dig> and neo are regulated by tgfβ through the smad signaling pathway  <cit> . it was therefore of interest to examine the expression of these genes in our cell culture as it might provide insights into the role of tgfβ <dig> in the ra-regulated early heart morphogenesis. since a genbank sequence analysis of fn and neo genes did not reveal the presence of rare elements in their promoters, they are not direct ra target genes.

we found that in our chicken hfr cell cultures the baseline level of fn1gene expression was increased when ra was added to the cultures in both dmem and endo-grow media , however, it was not a dose-dependent increase. an explanation for this observation might be that fn <dig> is relatively insensitive to small changes of ra concentrations in the environment at this time point in development, and that higher levels of ra are required to affect its expression; the mechanism of this is not known. in contrast, fn <dig> was reported to be down-regulated by ra in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells nih-3 t <dig>  <cit> . further studies are needed both in vivo and in a culture model to clarify the ra/fn interactions during heart formation. it is, however, very likely that the fn <dig> expression observed in our hfr cultures is of biological significance since the expression of various other genes examined in this in vitro system was similar to that observed in vivo.

the expression of neo gene in the cultured chicken hfr cells would suggest the presence of neuronal cell subpopulation that might have been derived from the early neuronal tube region located underneath the hfr of the embryo and that had not been completely removed during the preparation of the explants. however, since neo regulates diverse developmental events  <cit> , it may also be involved in cardiovascular development. support for this hypothesis comes from our observation that in the cultured chicken hfr cells neo is regulated by ra  and this regulation appears to be via tgfβ <dig> signaling, since neo expression in response to ra concentration in the endo-grow media paralleled that of tgfβ <dig> expression . thus, our study is the first to report the novel observation that ra regulates neo expression in the vertebrate embryo and at a critical time of heart morphogenesis. since genbank sequence analysis of this gene did not reveal the presence of rare elements in its promoters, we hypothesize that in the cultured chicken hfr cells neo is regulated by ra indirectly through a tgfβ <dig> signaling pathway. although in most systems tgfβ signals are linked to smad transcriptional activity events  <cit> , in ovo studies with quail embryos suggest that the ra-regulated tgfβ <dig> signaling during early heart morphogenesis is linked to smad- independent pathways  <cit> . further studies are needed to determine if the ra-regulated neo expression observed in the cultured chicken hfr cells is linked to heart morphogenesis and to tgfβ <dig> signaling, and if smad transcription factors are involved.

studies with quail embryos in ovo have also demonstrated vitamin a requirement for embryonic vasculogenesis and for the generation of endothelial cell progenitors during early heart morphogenesis, suggesting that an insufficiency of endothelial cells may be a crucial factor in the vad-related heart malformations  <cit> . importantly, these in vivo studies have also revealed that vitamin a is required to build the link between the primordial heart and its blood supply, i.e. the cardiac inflow tract  <cit> . this event most likely involves vegf-a which is required for angiogenesis and the organization of blood vessels  <cit> . ra-regulated vegf-a expression involving tgfβ signaling has been reported in human embryonic stem cells  <cit> . the above observations prompted us to determine if vegf-a is expressed in the cultured chicken hfr cells and if it is regulated by ra. indeed, in these cultures we observed vegf-a expression , which was significantly enhanced by added ra . it is very likely that the in vitro observed vegf-a expression represents the in ovo situation. sequence analysis of the vegf-a promoter revealed two typical rare sequences therefore ra might directly modulate vegf-a mrna synthesis. vegf upregulation by ra has also been observed in smooth muscle  <cit>  and in adipocytes  <cit> , while balmer and blomhoff reported inhibition of vegf by ra  <cit> . additionally, studies with the synthetic derivative cd <dig> showed that ra downregulates vegf-a expression through activation of ap <dig>  <cit> . these contradictory observations could be explained by species differences and different cell types used, e.g. human keratinocytes  <cit> , and tumor endothelial cells  <cit> . furthermore, none of these publications specify which vegf transcript variant was used in the studies.

altogether, the cultured chicken hfr cell model is a biologically relevant system to examine ra-regulated vertebrate early heart morphogenesis under conditions that allow the manipulation of ra activity. experiments on ra-regulated genes described here set the basis for future studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in vertebrate cardiovascular morphogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in vertebrate developmental research, relevant in vivo models are not always accessible and in many instances in vitro models can provide alternative approaches to advance the field. we have developed a biologically relevant and valid in vitro primary cell culture model from early stage chicken heart forming regions that provides an excellent research tool to study retinoic acid  regulated molecular mechanisms during vertebrate early heart morphogenesis under conditions that closely mimic in vivo heart morphogenesis. we have verified the usefulness of the in vitro model by confirming published in vivo observations regarding the regulation of tgfβ <dig> by ra during early heart formation, as well as by identifying additional ra-regulated genes, i.e. fn, neo and vegf-a that might be linked to early heart morphogenesis. the in vitro model described here will be a valuable addition to the experimental tools for vertebrate developmental research.
