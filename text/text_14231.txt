BACKGROUND
when a living organism is subjected to extreme environmental conditions for an extended period of time, an adaptive response may become crucial for its continued existence. the response of eukaryotic cells such as yeast to environmental stress involves complex changes in gene expression which subsequently lead to various metabolic responses to induce adaptation to the new conditions. fluctuating external osmolarity, like changes in salt concentration, leads to altered transcription of many responsive genes in an effort to counteract the stress with the activity of their protein products. one of the earliest protective biochemical responses is the biosynthesis and accumulation of glycerol as an osmolyte via the activation of corresponding genes. the resulting glycerol accumulates in the cytosol and leads to increased internal osmolarity, thus restoring the osmotic gradient between the cells and their environment  <cit> . in the salt-sensitive yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the hyperosmotic stress caused by  <dig>  m nacl leads to the transient transcriptional induction of more than  <dig> genes, as a consequence of simultaneous action of the general stress response pathway together with the high-osmolarity glycerol  mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling pathway  <cit> . a functional hog pathway is essential for the efficient up-regulation of the vast majority of genes in response to hyperosmotic conditions  <cit> . the terminal mapk, hog <dig>  accumulates in the nucleus within minutes of exposure to high salt concentrations  <cit> , whereupon it phosphorilates and activates the hog-specific transcription factors sko <dig>  <cit>  and smp <dig>  <cit> , or recruits hot <dig>  <cit>  and the general stress-response transcriptional activators msn <dig>  msn <dig> and msn <dig>  <cit>  to the promoters of osmoinducible genes. findings that hog <dig> could be an integral part of the upstream activation complex, targeting not only the activators but also components of the general transcription machinery, such as rna polymerase ii  <cit>  together with hog1-guided recruitment of rpd <dig> histone deacetylase to the chromatin  <cit> , have highlighted the additional level of complexity in the regulation of gene expression during hyperosmotic conditions.

to date, studies on hyperosmotic adaptation and salt tolerance in fungal species have been largely performed with the salt-sensitive model organism s. cerevisiae, for reasons of experimental convenience. however, the cellular machinery of s. cerevisiae is not adapted to the extreme hyperosmolar pressure caused by a salty environment with more than 1– <dig> m nacl concentration. therefore the specially adapted extremely halotolerant yeast-like fungus hortaea werneckii represents a novel eukaryotic organism for studying cellular responses to extremely elevated environmental salinity. this naturally osmoadaptable species was first isolated from hypersaline crystallizer ponds in salterns  <cit> , where nacl concentration fluctuates from  <dig>  m up to saturate solution levels . the increase in surrounding salt concentration is accompanied by increased intracellular glycerol accumulation in h. werneckii  <cit> . the glycerol accumulation suggested the activation of the hog-like pathway. the mapk hwhog <dig> was later identified, showing its highest activity at a concentration of  <dig>  m nacl  <cit> . many cellular and physiological differences were observed between h. werneckii cells growing in the extremely hypersaline environment of  <dig>  m nacl and those growing in a moderate salinity of  <dig> m nacl, which has been assigned as the optimal metabolic condition for h. werneckii  <cit> . therefore the characterization of the differential transcriptional response and identification of hwhog1-target genes in h. werneckii when under extreme hypersaline conditions could provide new insight into eukaryotic saline-response genetics.

in this study we have identified a set of differentially expressed genes in hyperosmotically adapted h. werneckii. expression profiles of the genes were determined for both hyperosmotically-adapted and hyperosmotically-stressed h. werneckii cells. the identified genes were tested for interaction with hwhog <dig> and rna polymerase ii. here we report a new insight into the differential expression of osmoresponsive genes in an extremely halotolerant eukaryotic microorganism and suggest a role for these genes in adaptive metabolism.

RESULTS
since h. werneckii occupies a different ecological niche than s. cerevisiae, it is not surprising that these yeasts perceive hyperosmotic environments differently. in contrast to s. cerevisiae, h. werneckii can actively grow in a wide range of external salt concentrations, which shows that the cells are also well adapted to an extremely hypersaline environment. differentially expressed genes in h. werneckii cells grown in different salinities therefore represent the transcriptional response of the adapted cells, rather than the stress response. previous work has shown differences in the activation of hwhog <dig> between the halotolerant h. werneckii and s. cerevisiae  <cit> . in the present work, we tried to address two questions:  what is the transcriptional response of h. werneckii adapted to a hypersaline environment compared with transcription under optimal growth conditions, and  whether and how the major hog pathway effector mapk hwhog <dig> is associated with the expression of osmoresponsive genes in h. werneckii.

bioinformatical characterization of the hw <dig> - <dig> subtracted library revealed over-representation of h. werneckii osmoresponsive genes in functional groups of metabolism and energy
it is a special challenge to identify a relatively large group of differentially-expressed genes that are specifically connected with the response to a certain environmental stimulus in an organism, without the availability of a sequenced genome. a suppression subtractive hybridization  cdna library was prepared to study the differential expression of genes related to halotolerance in h. werneckii between cells growing in optimal salinity  and cells growing in extreme salinity . a mirror orientation selection  method  <cit>  and differential cross-screening of the ssh-clones were employed after ssh to augment the subtracted library for differentially expressed genes. a total of  <dig> colonies were subjected to highly stringent differential screening. according to this selection,  <dig> clones  from the hw <dig> - <dig> subtracted library were strong candidates for differentially expressed genes. the nucleotide sequences were analyzed and their putative functions identified by searching blastx. as a result, a total of  <dig>  unique singletons and assembled sequences were identified . redundancy-check analysis  revealed that the  <dig> most abundant ests occupied  <dig> % of the hw <dig> - <dig> subtraction library. a comparison with the genbank database revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> cdnas  had a high degree of sequence similarity  with genes from other organisms of fungal origin. from the remaining  <dig> sequences ,  <dig> sequences  could be identified with a low degree of similarity and  <dig> sequences  with weak or no similarity  to genes from other organisms. the names for the identified sequences were assigned according to the saccharomyces genome database  <cit>  standard names of the closest orthologs from s. cerevisiae with the prefix hw for hortaea werneckii . for unidentified genes, weakly similar genes or genes without known orthologs in s. cerevisiae, the names were assigned as sol followed by a consecutive number in our arbitrary library of h. werneckii hyperosmolarity-induced expressed sequence tags   <cit> . the putative functions of the ests with e-values lower than 10- <dig>  were categorized as suggested by the mips database funcat functional annotation scheme based on s. cerevisiae classification  <cit> . for eight ests without a corresponding s. cerevisiae ortholog, a matched ortholog was found in other organisms and they were functionally classified by literature . as can be seen in table  <dig>  general metabolism proteins , followed by energy production , were the most common categories among the  <dig> functional categories. of  <dig> unclassified sol genes, sol <dig>  sol <dig>  sol <dig>  sol <dig>  sol <dig>  sol <dig>  sol <dig> and sol <dig> showed very weak similarity with other s. cerevisiae genes as aligned by a wu-blast <dig> search, whereas sol <dig>  sol  <dig>  sol <dig>  sol <dig> and sol <dig> were completely unrelated to known genes from databases. these transcripts might thus be specifically related to the adaptation capability of h. werneckii to extremely high salt concentrations. the most unexpected discovery among differentially expressed ests from the hw <dig> - <dig> subtracted library was the identification of the sol <dig> gene, which shows the highest similarity with opsins from two other dothideomycetes fungi, phaeosphaeria nodorum and leptosphaeria maculans, respectively. l. maculans rhodopsin represents the first proven case of a light-driven transmembraneproton translocation by retinal-binding protein from a fungal organism  <cit> , suggesting that some fungal classes may use the rhodopsin-based bioenergetic pathway previously observed only in prokaryotes.

the majority of osmoresponsive genes in halotolerant h. werneckii are up-regulated in  <dig>  m nacl
to confirm the differential expression and expression profiles of the ests obtained from the hw <dig> - <dig> library, a relative semi-quantitative rt-pcr was carried out. a total of  <dig>  ests of interest, together with controls, were selected for further analyses. the levels of corresponding mrnas in cells adapted to  <dig> m or  <dig>  m nacl were then analyzed. all of the  <dig> tested genes were confirmed as truly differentially expressed in h. werneckii adapted either to  <dig> m or  <dig>  m nacl. the magnitude of induction or repression of these genes is presented in table  <dig>  whereas the expression profiles are presented in figures 1a, b and  <dig> . fifty  of the  <dig> genes were up-regulated 2- to 7-fold in  <dig>  m nacl. besides hwgpd1a, used as a control ,  <dig> genes  were up-regulated more than 7-fold in  <dig>  m nacl compared with  <dig> m nacl: hwelf <dig>  hwerv <dig>  hwfre <dig>  hwgdh <dig>  hwopi <dig>  hwpma <dig>  hwpry <dig>  hwrps16a, hwtdh <dig> and sol <dig>  the expression of these genes was virtually undetectable or barely detectable in cells from the  <dig> m nacl medium. by contrast, only  <dig>  of the genes studied by rt-pcr were preferentially induced in  <dig> m nacl: hwcdc <dig>  hwhta <dig>  hwsun <dig>  hwtub <dig>  sol <dig> and sol <dig>  they were  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold down-regulated in  <dig>  m nacl. of the  <dig> novel hyperosmolarity-induced sol genes studied by rt-pcr, only sol <dig> was down-regulated.

expression of osmoresponsive genes is different in salt-adapted and salt-stressed h. werneckii cells
induction of gene transcription has been recognized as a crucial mechanism for the adaptation of yeast cells to saline stress. accurate whole genome expression analysis by microarray has been performed on s. cerevisiae at different salt concentrations  and different time points , resulting in different patterns of gene expression  <cit> . we asked if the salt concentration-dependent differences in the expression of h. werneckii osmoresponsive genes are characteristics of the adaptation phase only, or if these genes would also respond to acute hypersaline stress. to study the acute stress response, h. werneckii cells were exposed to hypersaline stress and the level of gene expression over the next  <dig> minutes was followed by rt-pcr. as shown in figures 1a, b and  <dig> , time-dependent gene expression was observed only for half of the genes under study. genes were nominated as "salt-stress responsive" if the mrna level was induced or repressed at least 2-fold during the  <dig> min period following the salt stress. whereas  <dig>  genes were shown to be responsive to the acute hypersaline stress , the expression of  <dig>  genes was not susceptible to the stress. as salt-stress responsive genes responded with different time courses of induction or repression, they were grouped into  <dig> early-induced genes and  <dig> delayed-induced genes if the 2-fold increase in mrna level was observed within or after the first  <dig> min of salt stress, respectively; and  <dig> repressed genes, whose of mrna level decreased within the first 10– <dig> min after salt stress. those genes that were induced more than 5-fold during salt stress were hwecm <dig>  hwrad <dig>  hwrpn <dig>  hwskn <dig>  hwugp <dig> and hwgpd1a as a control from the early-induced genes; and hwopi <dig>  hwsun <dig>  sol <dig> and sol <dig> from delayed-induced genes. rt-pcr examination of sol <dig> repeatedly resulted in two pcr products , suggesting a co-amplification of similar genes, both up-regulated in adapted cells , whereas it seems that only one of them responded to hypersaline stress. among repressed genes,hwfre <dig>  hwnhp6a and sol <dig> were more than 5-fold down-regulated after acute salt stress.

these data demonstrate that in contrast to the response of the adapted cells, only a portion of the identified differentially expressed genes in h. werneckii transcriptionally responded to acute hypersaline stress as well. interestingly, hwfre <dig>  hwkar <dig>  hwnhp6a, hwstt <dig>  sol <dig> and sol <dig> were up-regulated in cells adapted to extreme hypersaline conditions, but they were actually repressed after acute hypersaline stress. additionally, hwcdc <dig>  hwsun <dig> and sol <dig> were down-regulated in cells adapted to extreme hypersaline conditions, but induced during stress. this observation indicates an additional level of complexity in regulation of gene expression in halotolerant yeast when compared with the stress response of salt-sensitive s. cerevisiae.

it is noteworthy that the expression profile of h. werneckii adapted to  <dig>  m nacl is very different from the hypersaline stressed cells of s. cerevisiae. in comparison with the microarray studies performed with s. cerevisiae  <cit> , using ssh-mos we have identified only  <dig> gene orthologs that were clearly up-regulated in adapted or stressed h. werneckii and also in salt-stressed wild-type s. cerevisiae: hwbmh <dig>  hwcit <dig>  hwgnd <dig>  hwgut <dig>  hwhsp <dig>  hwkgd <dig>  hwmdh <dig>  hwopi <dig>  hwrpl16a, hwrps10b, hwrps <dig>  hwrps8a, hwshy <dig>  hwssa <dig>  hwtdh <dig>  hwtif <dig>  hwtkl <dig>  and hwugp <dig>  however, some discrepancies were observed between the compared microarray data in s. cerevisiae studies mentioned above. among upregulated genes in salt-stressed s. cerevisiae, only hwgut <dig>  hwopi <dig>  hwtkl <dig> and hwugp <dig> were also salt-stress responsive in h. werneckii. the mrna levels of hwecm <dig>  hweft <dig>  hwfas <dig>  hwfun <dig>  hwgdh <dig>  hwmet <dig>  hwmet <dig>  hwmet <dig>  hwmir <dig>  hwnuc <dig>  hwpma <dig>  hwpry <dig> hwrpl6a, hwrps16a, hwsam <dig>  hwstt <dig>  hwtef <dig>  hwtif <dig> and hwtom <dig> were induced in h. werneckii adapted to  <dig>  m nacl, whereas these levels diminished or remained unaffected in salt-stressed s. cerevisiae. two genes, dbp <dig> and sun <dig> were substantially downregulated in both, the hypersalinity-adapted h. werneckii and salt stressed s. cerevisiae. it was also found that gnd <dig>  gpd <dig> and ssa <dig> belong to a common environmental response  genes in s. cerevisiae, which were affected not only by high salinity but various stresses such as heat, high or low ph, oxidative stress and sorbitol  <cit>  and therefore might also present the cer response in h. werneckii. interestingly, the induction of ssa <dig> was extremely stress-responsive in s. cerevisiae , whereas it was only slightly affected by high salt concentration in h. werneckii .

one theory is that the main difference between salt-sensitive and halotolerant organisms in the expression of osmoresponsive genes relates to the inducibility and/or maintenance of the transcription level of protective genes. the perception threshold for the extracellular "hyper"-osmolarity in extremely halotolerant yeasts must be set at concentrations higher than salt-sensitive unicellular eukaryotes could even survive. in h. werneckii adapted to these extreme conditions, the protective response remains "on", meaning that there is a long-term up-regulation program of specific genes, and this up-regulation does not decrease over time.

hwhog <dig> associates with  <dig> novel osmoresponsive genes in chromatin of long-term adapted cells
the transcriptional induction or repression of approximately  <dig> genes in s. cerevisiae that are strongly responsive to salt stress was highly or fully dependent on the hyperosmolarity-responsive mapk hog <dig>  indicating that the hog1-mediated signaling pathway plays a key role in global gene regulation under saline stress conditions  <cit> . it has been shown that following exposure to salt stress, hog <dig> is retained in the nucleus and becomes associated with the chromatin of target genes  <cit> . we approached the study of endogenous hwhog <dig> interaction with the chromatin regions of identified up-regulated genes in adapted h. werneckii cells by a chromatin immunoprecipitation  pcr assay. lacking information on promoter regions for the identified differentially-expressed genes in h. werneckii, a chip-coding region pcr amplification was performed. it has recently been shown that the activated hog <dig> in s. cerevisiae is associated with elongating rna polymerase ii and is therefore recruited to the entire coding region of osmoinducible genes  <cit> . hwgpd1a was used as a positive control for the hwhog1-chip. as negative controls for the association of hwhog <dig> with dna, the hwcob <dig> gene encoded in mitochondrial dna and the 26s rrna gene  transcribed by rna polymerase i were used.

the results of the hwhog1-dna interactions determined by chip are shown in figure  <dig>  third column. as evidenced by pcr, the protein hwhog <dig> cross-linked with the coding region of the positive control hwgpd1a and  <dig> of the differentially expressed genes , but not with the negative control genes hwcob <dig> and hw26srr. as seen from the pcr product level, for  <dig> up-regulated genes the interaction with hwhog <dig> was stronger in cells adapted to  <dig>  m nacl. in contrast, for  <dig> down-regulated genes , the hwhog1-chip signal was stronger in cells adapted to  <dig> m nacl.

genome-wide expression profiling studies using wild-type and hog <dig> mutant s. cerevisiae cells were performed to comparatively identify genes whose up-regulation of expression was dependent on hog <dig>  of several hundred genes whose rna levels were hog1-dependent, a relatively small subset of approximately  <dig> high-osmolarity induced genes had a strong requirement for hog <dig> for their induction  <cit> . among them, only the ugp <dig> ortholog was induced in  <dig>  m nacl adapted and salt-stressed h. werneckii cells. other yeast orthologs of hwhog1-chip positive genes in h. werneckii were reported for the first time in the present study in connection with mapk hog <dig>  however, the hwhog1-chip did not confirm the hwhog <dig> interaction with the hwugp <dig> gene in salt-adapted h. werneckii. the relative distribution of hwhog1-dependent genes was approximately equivalent among functional categories, except in the case of transcription, cellular transport, signal transduction mechanism and cell fate categories , where the hwhog1-chip positive genes represented more than 70% of tested genes. only  <dig> of  <dig> tested sol genes  with unknown functions  were hwhog1-chip positive. caution must be applied to the interpretation of genes which were hwhog1-chip negative, since many of them were salt-stress responsive. these genes could still be regulated by hwhog <dig>  it is possible that during long-term adaptation the continuous interaction of hwhog <dig> with their genomic region is not obligatory, and thus hwhog <dig> was not cross-linked with the chromatin. alternatively, hwhog <dig> could activate responsible factors more distal to the chromatin, thereby avoiding the cross-linking range.

hwhog <dig> and rna polymerase ii co-localization in coding regions of osmoresponsive genes is reflected by elevated levels of corresponding transcript in adapted cells
it has been previously shown that in the hog response, the nuclear retention and chromatin association of hog <dig> in s. cerevisiae depends on co-localization with general transcription machinery components  <cit> . we further asked whether hwhog <dig> cross-linking occurs with co-localization of rna polymerase ii in the case of hwhog1-dependent genes. a sequential hwhog1-chip analysis  using primers specific for the genes identified as hwhog1-positive was therefore performed after the primary rnapolii-chip. if the interaction of hwhog <dig> and rnapolii existed within the same genomic region of hwhog1-positive genes, the pcr signal should be obtained in eluates of seqchip. as shown in figure  <dig>  fourth column, the co-localization of hwhog <dig> and rna polymerase ii existed in  <dig> cases out of  <dig> hwhog1-chip positive differentially expressed genes. similarly, if the co-occupancy of hwhog <dig> and rnapolii favored gene expression, then the relative ratio of amplified pcr products from seqchip eluates should reflect the relative ratio of rt-pcr results from the gene expression in adapted cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  the ratio of amplified pcr products in seqchip-positive genes does indeed reflect the ratio of mrna levels observed by rt-pcr in both conditions of adaptation. co-occupation of hwhog <dig> and rna polymerase ii in target genes resulted in an increased pcr signal in seqchip, with an accompanying increased level of corresponding transcript in rt-pcr analyses.

taken together, these observations indicate a stimulating role for hwhog <dig> and rna polymerase ii co-localization on the efficiency of transcription of indicated genes, even in long-term high-salt adapted cells. regarding the coding region positioning of primer pairs used in this study, we can say that in h. werneckii hwhog <dig> also associates with the elongating rna polymerase ii, as has recently been shown in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . in our study, h. werneckii cells used for chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses were completely adapted to extremely high environmental salt concentration by long-term growth in media containing either  <dig> m or  <dig>  m nacl. these results thus reflect hwhog1/rnapolii-chromatin interactions, relevant for the extremely high saline conditions which until now could not be studied in salt-sensitive organisms. moreover, to date this study is the first large-scale exploration of hog <dig> interaction with target genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation in an organism with unavailable genomes. all similar studies have been performed using tagged and over-expressed proteins. our study relays information based entirely on the cross-linking of endogenous hwhog <dig> and rna polymerase ii with their downstream targets on the chromatin, showing actual physiological interactions never studied before in eukaryotic cells adapted to such an extremely hyperosmotic condition.

an integrative model of osmoresponsive gene action through functional modules in h. werneckii
the transcriptional behavior of some genes from our analysis correlated with known biochemical hyperosmotic stress responses in s. cerevisiae . nevertheless, important differences were observed between the two organisms, which presumably contribute to the remarkable capacity of h. werneckii for adaptation to extreme environments. we propose the following model of gene action through functional modules in h. werneckii adaptation to a hypersaline environment . during long-term adaptive growth in extreme salinity , there is a constant need to pump protons across the plasma membrane, which provides the electrochemical driving force for the na+/h+-antiporters and p-type atpases hwena1/ <dig> to exclude the intruding sodium cations  <cit>  and to maintain the correct intracellular ph and plasma membrane potential. the  <dig> -fold up-regulation of proton-exporting plasma membrane atpase gene hwpma <dig>  which is also represented as the most frequent est from the hw <dig> - <dig> subtracted library, indicates the importance of cytoplasmic ph regulation and proton gradient across the plasma membrane. we have observed a substantial decrease in growth media ph from ph  <dig>  down to ph  <dig>  during the log phase, which was more evident and faster with h. werneckii growing in  <dig>  m nacl than in  <dig> m nacl . therefore the cell has to increase its energy production machinery to supply the energetic demands of ion homeostasis. the functional category of energy supply was highly represented among up-regulated genes  in  <dig>  m nacl, including those coding for components of the electron transport chain  and atp production , and conveying the excessive cytosolic nadh into the mitochondrial respiratory chain . more than 10-fold up-regulation of hwfre <dig> gene could indicate the increased requirements for the ferric-chelate reductase activity – namely, to satisfy the need for enhanced iron assimilation or reduction of oxidized iron-containing complexes under extremely hypersaline condition. energy production metabolism seems to be additionally enhanced by the up-regulation of genes coding for the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway , the tricarboxylic acid cycle , the pentose phosphate pathway , and modulation of energy storage . more than 8-fold up-regulation of a specific mitochondrial inner-membrane pi transporter gene, hwmir <dig>  further supported the idea of increased energy demands in h. werneckii growing at  <dig>  m nacl as compared to cells growing in a lower salinity, since most cellular atp is produced within the mitochondria from adp and pi. many of the hw <dig> - <dig> genes described so far, together with hwsun <dig>  hwtom <dig>  hwshy <dig> and hwnuc <dig>  code for mitochondrial enzymes, indicating the process of continuous adaptation to hypersaline conditions must be strongly supported by the biogenesis of mitochondria. indeed, in the subcellular fractionation experiment we found that the quantity of isolated mitochondria was at least 2-fold higher in cells from  <dig>  m nacl, and that the succinate dehydrogenase activity per μg of mitochondria was  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold higher compared with mitochondria from  <dig> m nacl . the biogenesis of mitochondria is coupled with elevated protein synthesis. specific ribosomal protein isoforms  and translation-regulating factors  are synthesized, which could be more effective in the translation of desired transcripts under unfavorable conditions and thereby increase the proliferative potential of the cell. the quantity of synthesized or damaged proteins could impair the ability of the cell to properly fold the resultant proteins; thus the components of protein quality control and the unfolded protein response  are constantly up-regulated. the increased protein synthesis is also coupled with up-regulation of genes coding for enzymes from amino acid biosynthetic pathways  and an amino acid permease . from this point of view, the basic metabolic network is constitutively working to meet the demands of the increased energy expenditure needed to balance the ionic and the osmotic homeostasis. because the environmental osmolarity of the natural habitat of h. werneckii can change, the plasma membrane has to be fluid enough, enabling the proper dynamics of signaling processes in a wide range of environmental salinities. electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements showed that the membranes of all halophilic fungi in extremely saline environments were more fluid than those of the salt-sensitive s. cerevisiae, which was in close agreement with the sterol-to-phospholipids ratio and fatty acid unsaturation level  <cit> . plasma membrane fluidity could be supported by the biosynthesis of unsaturated or methylated lipids as a consequence of the  <dig> -fold up-regulation of hwopi <dig> and related genes . the interaction of cells with the cellular environment is mediated through the cell wall, which is highly implicated in the regulation of cellular turgor pressure. two poorly described s. cerevisiae orthologs connected to cell wall integrity and architecture encoded by hwecm <dig> and hwsun <dig> were identified as salt-responsive in h. werneckii. the finding that the major component of the septin complex hwcdc <dig> was strongly down-regulated, together with hwsun <dig>  could explain the substantially prolonged generation period of h. werneckii cells grown in  <dig>  m nacl compared to those grown in  <dig> m nacl  <cit> . the role of interaction with the cellular environment is also assigned to sol <dig> and sol <dig>  coding for acetyl-xylan esterase and feruloyl esterase orthologs, respectively, and to one of the most up-regulated genes at  <dig>  m nacl, the hwpry <dig> gene, putatively coding for pathogenesis-related proteins in plants. the roles of both esterases in the automodulation of the cell wall dynamic as an adaptive response to high turgor pressure remains speculative.

CONCLUSIONS
in our study, we have identified a set of  <dig> osmoresponsive genes in the extremely halotolerant black yeast h. werneckii adapted to a moderately saline environment of  <dig> m nacl or an extremely saline environment of  <dig>  m nacl. among them, more than half were related with general metabolism and energy. thirteen unclassified sol genes represent a specific transcriptional response unique to h. werneckii. a novel offset of  <dig> genes was shown as hog1-dependent in long-term adaptation to extreme environments, previously not assigned as such in the salt-sensitive model organism s. cerevisiae. the combined data indicate important differences in the cellular processes of osmoadaptation between halotolerant and salt-sensitive yeasts. the novel set of osmoresponsive genes probably represents only a portion of actual differentially expressed genes in h. werneckii; however, we believe that valuable information was obtained concerning genes related to the hypersaline adaptation of extremely halotolerant eukaryotes.
