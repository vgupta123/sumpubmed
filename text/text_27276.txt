BACKGROUND
milk is the primary source of nutrition for newborns, and breastfeeding is known to make a valuable contribution to infant health  <cit> . breast milk contains a potent mixture of diverse components including milk fat globules , immune competent cells, antibodies, soluble proteins, cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides  <cit>  that together protect young infants against infections  <cit> . in addition, the milk contains growth factors which could promote intestinal development  <cit>  and may protect infants against developing allergies  <cit> . meanwhile, milk also contain many microvesicles, such as milk-derieved exosomes, who was reported to transfer contained rnas to living cells and influenced the development of calf’s gastrointestinal and immune systems  <cit> .

exosomes are small membrane vesicles  which released from producing cells into the extracellular environment  <cit> . many different cell types have the capacity to produce and release exosomes . additionally, milk-derived exosomes have been reported in humans, cows and pigs  and which involved in many biological processes. exosomes contain proteins, mrnas, mirnas and lipids. recent studies revealed that human  <cit> , bovine  <cit> , pig  <cit> , and rat  <cit>  milk contain mirnas, and mrnas have also been identified in whey .  <dig>  mrna transcripts were detected in rat milk, and some immune and development-related mrnas showed time-dependent expression  <cit> .  <dig>  mrnas were detected by microarray analyses in bovine milk exosomes, and they had possible effects of human cells  <cit> . additionally, cecilia lässer et al. demonstrated that mrnas in breast milk exosomes could be taken up by human macrophages  <cit> .until now, the components of mrnas in porcine milk exosmes are still unclear.

proteins in exosome were dependented on the specific cell-type  <cit> , the dendritic cell-derived exosomes contain several cytosolic proteins  <cit> . body fluid derived exosomes cd <dig>  cd <dig>  annexin- <dig> and hsp <dig> were as positive marker proteins  <cit> . anti-mhc-class ii- and anti-cd <dig> beads were used to isolate human breast milk exosmes  <cit> . in bovine milk exosomes  <dig>  proteins were identified, and all major exosome protein markers were abundant  <cit> , as were milk fat globule membrane  proteins. another report showed  <dig>  proteins in bovine milk exosome via itraq, and  <dig> exosomal proteins were found to be differentially regulated by infections  <cit> .

in our previous study, mirnas in porcine milk exosomes have been revealed by deep sequencing  <cit> , but up to now, porcine milk exosomal mrnas and proteins remains unknown. therefore, we further performed rna-sequencing and proteomic analysis of porcine milk exosomes in order to understand new physiological functions, especially immunity and proliferation related regulation of porcine milk.

methods

rna-sequencing
the collected rna samples were analyzed by illuminahiseq™  <dig> analyzer at beijing genomics institute as previously described  <cit> . firstly, poly  mrna was isolated from total rna sample with oligo magnetic beads. secondly, the purified mrna was fragmented by the rna fragmentation kit , the first-strand cdna synthesis was performed using random hexamer primers and reverse transcriptase, and the second-strand cdna was synthesized using rnase h and dna polymerase i. then the cdna libraries were prepared using the illumina genomic dna sample prep kit  following the manufacturer’s protocol. finally, the library was sequencing using illumina hiseq™  <dig> 

sequencing analysis
the porcine reference genome sequence and annotated transcript set were downloaded from the ensemble database . after quality control  step of raw reads, then removing low quality reads, reads containing ns >  <dig> and reads containing adapters, clean reads were aligned to the reference pig genomic database  with soapaligner/soap <dig>  <cit>  and allowing up to  <dig> mismatches in 90-bp reads. the alignment data were utilized to calculate distribution of reads on pig gene database , and the numbers of reads per kilobase of dexon region in a gene per million mapped reads were used as the value of normalized gene expression levels  <cit> . the unalignment data carried out novel transcript prediction, reads are at least 200 bp away from annotated gene, the transcript is of length over <dig> bp and the sequencing depth is no less than  <dig> for novel transcript unit analysis.

qpcr identification of known mrnas in porcine milk exosome
total rna  was first digested with dnase i , and 2 μg of total rna was reverse transcribed by oligo .the cdna was diluted by 2-fold with ddh2o, and pcr was performed on a bio-rad system  in a final 20 μl volume reaction, containing 2 μl pcr cdna, 10 μl of 2× pcr mix  and 1 mm of each primer. the real-time pcr thermal profile was as follows: 5 min at 95 °c, 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °c, 30 s at the corresponding annealing temperature  and 72 °c for 30 s, followed by 72 °c at 10 min, and 5s ribosomal rna was used as an internal control for the pcr  <cit> . the mrnas primers were designed with primer  <dig>  .table  <dig> primers for qpcr




total protein extraction
ripa lysis buffer was used to extract porcine milk exosomal proteins according to the assay kit protocol . briefly, 1 mm pmsf was added to the ripa lysis buffer and 100–200 μl was added to porcine milk exosomes. following complete exosome lysis, the sample was centrifuged at  <dig> – <dig>  g for 3–5 min and the supernatant was subjected to further analysis. proteins were stored at −80 °c until used.

discussions
in the present study, we totally obtained  <dig>  known genes and  <dig>  putative novel genes in porcine milk exosomes. it was reported  <dig>  mrna transcripts in rats whey  <cit>  and  <dig>  transcripts in bovine milk whey exosome by mrna microarray. moreover, in human milk,  <dig>  transcripts were found in fat globules  <cit> . some of milk protein genes , ribosome-related proteins genes  and other genes  were highly expressed in the previous researches  <cit> , which were in accordance with this study . furthermore, some genes such as lalba, tpt <dig>  spp <dig> and fasn were not found in rats whey  <cit> , bovine milk whey exosome and human milk fat globules  <cit> . additionally, the randomly selected  <dig> mrnas among top  <dig> were further confirmed using qrt-pcr. differences of mrnas in milk or milk exosome exist among species, possibly indicating different functions of milk among species.

one of the aims in the present study was to explore the protein content of porcine milk exosomes using proteomics. in the present study, we observed  <dig> proteins  including the exosomal marker proteins cd <dig>  <cit>  and cd <dig>  <cit>  using western blotting , as well as the heat shock protein family members hspa  <dig> b <dig>  hspa <dig>  hspa <dig>  hspa  <dig>  hspb <dig> and hspcb , which have been reported in previous exosome research  <cit> . the western blotting results in our study confirmed that we successfully isolated porcine milk exosomes. previous study using itraq identified  <dig>  milk proteins with  <dig>  from exosomes,  <dig>  from mfgm, and  <dig> from whey   <cit> , another study found  <dig>  proteins in bovine milk exosomes, including the major exosomal marker proteins lactadherin/mfge <dig> and tsg  <dig>   <cit> , the actin family members actc <dig>  actn <dig>  actn <dig>  and actn <dig> are cell-specific proteins likely involved in exosome biogenesis and potentially other exosome functions  <cit> , which were also present in porcine milk exosomes. however, xanthine oxidase , butyrophilin , lactadherin/mgf <dig>  and adipophilin/perilipin- <dig>  and mfgm were identified in bovine milk exosomes  <cit> , which were not detected in porcine milk exosomes. it has also been suggested that exosomes from different sources might contain different components  <cit>  and may play tissue-specific roles in intracellular communication and immune function .

in cog ontology analysis of mrnas and proteins, we obtained  <dig> conserved proteins and  <dig> mrnas relative to cell cycle. additionally, many genes and proteins involved in cell cycle and immunity related pathways by kegg pathways analysis. then, we randomly selected  <dig> proteins for western blotting analysis. platelet-derived growth factor  acts as a potential binding pattern mitogen for mesenchymal cells both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . epidermal growth factor  plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation during development  <cit> . thrombospondin <dig> , cysteine-rich protein  <dig>  and connective tissue growth factor  were all involved in the transforming growth factor-beta  signaling pathway  <cit> . high-temperature requirement a <dig>  inhibits bmp- <dig>  bmp- <dig> and tgf-β <dig> signaling  <cit> . lactoferrin  functions in inflammation  <cit> . myostatin  was a negative regulator of myogenesis and has been implicated in the regulation of adiposity and controlling the structure and function of tendons  <cit> . igfbp- <dig> acts through autocrine/paracrine pathways to inhibit braf-mek-erk signaling and induces senescence and apoptosis in cells containing the braf oncogene  <cit> . additionally, igfbp- <dig> inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in rko and sw <dig> cells  <cit> . confirmation of the presence of these  <dig> proteins in porcine milk exosomes suggests a possible function in the regulation of immunity, cell proliferation and possibly other pathways.

all previously reported exosomal proteins were cytosolic, and many of them were associated with the plasma membrane or membranes of endocytic compartments  <cit> . most of the genes and proteins identified in the present study were relatived to cytoplasm or cytoplasmic go terms . analysis of go, kegg and cog annotations suggested that most porcine milk exosome genes and proteins might function in activation, immunity and cell cycle. kegg analysis revealed that four pathways  were enriched in both bovine  <cit>  and porcine milk exosomes . above results indicate a similar function in different species. additionally, recent reports showed that the bovine milk exosomes were able to exert endocytosis and transferred their contained molecules to other cells  <cit> . in this study, proteins in porcine milk exosome were predicated to be involved in pathways of starch and sucrose metabolism, other glycan degradation, n-glycan biosynthesis, galactose metabolism and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis , it was deduced that porcine milk exosomes might transfer encapsulated materials, which could mediated by those proteins and played key roles in different physiological and pathological conditions. meanwhile, the kegg analysis of mrnas showed lots of genes enriched in purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, cell cycle and rna degradation pathways, which were different to predicated pathways in the kegg analysis of porcine milk exosomes proteins.

it is reported the viral rna  was able to transfer to infected cells  and trigger an innate immune response, depending on membrane vesicle trafficking  <cit> . the glioblastoma cells derived-exosome could deliver a specific mrna transcript to endothelia cells followed by generating functional proteins for patients  <cit> . when incubated with nih-3 t <dig> cells, milk-derived microvesicles could transfer bovine milk related transcripts to living cells and affect the calf’s gastrointestinal development and immune systems  <cit> . additionally, recent reports showed that bovine milk exosomes can be uptaken by endocytosis, depending on cell exosome surface glycoproteins  <cit> .the uptaking exosome further affected gene expression  <cit> . and exosome can also be incorporated into differentiated human cells with containing rna. these data collectively indicate the exosomes could not only deliver the encapsulated mirnas, mrnas and proteins to recipient cells, but also make their specific functions on immunity, thereafter play a key role in different physiological and pathological conditions. our results provided extensively mrnas and proteins data, which are beneficial to understand how milk regulates health and development of newborns by exosomes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified  <dig>  mrnas and  <dig> proteins in porcine milk exosomes by rna-sequencing and proteomic analysis, and many of mrnas and proteins were predicted to be involved in immunity, proliferation and cellular signaling, which would be closely associated with piglets development and healthy. these findings provided a large amount of informations and contributed to increased understanding of the role of genes and proteins in milk exosomes, and build a foundation for future studies on their physiological functions and regulatory mechanisms.
