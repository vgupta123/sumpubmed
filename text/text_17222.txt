BACKGROUND
in response to environmental or developmental signals, eukaryote cells normally transit to a specific state defined by the realization of its genetic network that specifies the gene expression and protein abundance levels. in the landscape of the cell state space, there exist attractors corresponding to different cell fates  <cit>  and barriers between these attractors constrain cells to one attractor . perturbations such as overexpression of a set of genes may push cells overcome the barriers and thus move from one attractor to another in the cell state space. an example is the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells  from differentiated somatic cells by overexpression of several genes  <cit> . a challenging problem is how to efficiently find effective, ideally the optimal, perturbations to reprogram a cell's fate. in addition, there are other unanswered questions such as how exactly cellular reprogramming occurs and what fundamental principles govern the reprogramming.

we attempt to tackle these challenges from a systems biology point of view and conduct a proof-of-concept study in the model organism budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. yeast cells proliferate in rich medium through cell cycles and sporulate when nutrients are limited in the environment. we choose these two important biological processes to illustrate how the cell fate can be reprogrammed by perturbing yeast cells, for example, such that they go through cell cycles under sporulation condition or vice versa.

to develop reprogramming recipes and gain mechanistic insights of the reprogramming process, we first assembled a network that regulates cell cycle and sporulation in yeast, which is feasible given the abundant data available. the next steps were to predict phenotypic consequences of perturbations to the cell , and to estimate the landscape of the cell state space to monitor the reprogramming process. methods have been proposed to predict phenotypes but none of them is applicable to search for reprogramming recipes. for example, one group of methods predicted phenotype of knocking out a gene as the phenotypes shared by its neighbor genes in the genetic network  <cit> . this approach does not serve the purpose of finding reprogramming recipe, which requires de novo prediction of phenotype. landscape in the cell state space has also been determined by estimating the probability of each state or solving differential equations to define the dynamics of the system  <cit> . however, these methods are limited to small circuits/networks that cannot provide sufficient molecular details of how reprogramming is achieved.

in this proof-of-concept study, we modeled the genetic network underlying cell cycle and sporulation in yeast using a simple graphical model, boolean network  <cit> . we defined the attractors of cell cycle and sporulation using marker genes. then, using the concept of cell state landscape and a sampling strategy, we illustrated that both quantitative  and qualitative  phenotypes can be satisfactorily predicted from the network structure without any additional information. such de novo phenotype prediction allows systematic search for perturbations that force the yeast cell to sporulate under the growth condition or vice versa. once the reprogramming path was defined, the potentials of cell states on the path were estimated by a sampling strategy, which avoids the difficulty of estimating the landscape for all possible cell states but still sheds light on understanding how the reprogramming proceeds from a landscape point of view. consistent with the landscape concept, we found many perturbations that may serve as reprogramming recipes. more importantly, our analyses suggest that successful reprogramming relies on the heterogeneity of the original cell state  and the restoration of the heterogeneity of the natural cells .

RESULTS
the network regulating cell cycle and sporulation in budding yeast
cell cycle and sporulation are two important biological processes that have been well studied in budding yeast. we have curated literature to assemble the key regulators into a 56-node network , including  <dig> proteins/complexes ,  <dig> logical and nodes, two gene groups , one pathway , one phenotype  and three signal  nodes.

besides the nodes representing proteins, logical and nodes were used to model the cooperation between multiple proteins that is required for regulating their target genes/proteins. for example, the node of fear represents cdc <dig> early anaphase release network, which includes proteins such as esp <dig>  spo <dig> and cdc <dig>  <cit> , and was thus modeled as an and node of these proteins. early and middle meiotic genes are required to be active for sporulation progress; they were collectively represented by emg and mmg nodes, respectively. note that the sporulation phenotype is an and node because it is activated only if both emg and mmg are on. the camp/pka signaling pathway suppresses the activity of several major sporulation activators such as rim <dig> and msn <dig>  and was represented by one node for simplicity  <cit> . since genetic network is dynamically realized in response to environmental cues, we deployed two signal nodes, growth and sporulation conditions, to mimic the medium conditions suitable for cell growth or sporulation induction. the "cell size" node represents the checkpoint entering s phase in the cell cycle if the yeast cell grows to a critical size  <cit> .

the curated network represents the current knowledge of cell cycle and sporulation in budding yeast. under growth condition, when the cell grows large enough to trigger the cell-size signal, cln <dig> is activated and it in turn activates mbf and sbf, which induces the transcription of cyclin clb <dig>  <cit> . the activation of clb <dig> drives the cell into s phase when dna replication begins  <cit> . then the transcription factor complex mcm1/sff is formed to activate clb <dig>  which controls the entry into m phase for segregation  <cit> . the exit from m phase requires degradation of clb <dig> by cdh <dig> and sic <dig>  the cell then goes to the stationary g <dig> phase before it grows to a critical size and conducts another round of division. under sporulation condition, the master meiotic regulator ime <dig>  repressed by growth condition, is turned on  <cit> . ime <dig>  ume <dig> and rim <dig> form a complex to activate early meiotic genes  including ndt <dig> and ime <dig>  <cit> . mmg and ndt <dig> are initially repressed by sum <dig> in the vegetative growth condition. activation of the kinase ime <dig> inhibits sum1's activity, which derepresses ndt <dig>  ndt <dig> then transcribes mmg as well as ime <dig>  ime <dig> and itself to form positive feedbacks. completing sporulation requires transcription of both emg and mmg  <cit> .

in the network, we assigned each node to one of three configurations if the incoming activation and repression signals are equal: self-degradation , self-sustaining  and self-activation . a self-degradation node tends to be off, which is a simplification of degradation process. for example, cln <dig>  cln <dig> and cln <dig> are degraded by a complex scf associated with grr <dig>  <cit> . these degradation mechanisms are not explicitly represented in the network. self-sustaining nodes denote proteins maintaining a constant level. for example, a self-sustaining protein cdh <dig> only functions in the g <dig> phase but its mrna level remains constant through the entire cell cycle  <cit> . the separin esp <dig> and the securin pds <dig> are involved in both meiotic progression and mitotic cell cycle arrest  <cit> . the transcription of esp <dig> is constant through the cell cycle  <cit>  and the location of pds <dig> is cell-cycle dependent  <cit> . denoting them as self-activation was to mimic the unknown mechanisms that activate these two proteins.

fixed points and dynamics of the network
the stationary states of the network in figure  <dig> reflect cell fates, either completing sporulation or going through cell cycles. to define the stationary states corresponding to sporulation is straightforward: the spor node is on, which requires on of both emg and mmg such that the cell is committed to sporulation  <cit> . to define the stationary g <dig> state in cell cycle, under growth condition we first evolved  <dig> , <dig> randomly selected states and find the stationary state with the maximum basin . we then identified all the proteins/complexes  in the network showing cyclic change of its state when evolving to the largest attractor. the stationary g <dig> states of cell cycle were reached if the states of these  <dig> nodes were the same as those in the largest attractor . unsurprisingly, we did observe the known activation of cdh <dig> and sic <dig> in the stationary g <dig> state. note that the temporal evolution of these  <dig> nodes indeed follows the biological pathway of cell cycle after the cell size signal is turned on : from the excited g <dig> state  to the s phase, the g <dig> phase, the m phase, and finally back to the stationary g <dig> state . this observation validates the representation of cell cycle phases and attractors using these  <dig> nodes . attractors other than sporulation and cell cycle are collectively referred as "other" .

differential equations have been successfully used to study detailed dynamics of yeast cell cycle  <cit> . since the genetic network shown in figure  <dig> also includes many genes involved in sporulation, most kinetic parameters needed are unknown. in addition, solving differential equations for the network with  <dig> nodes is difficult if not impossible. therefore, we exploited boolean network to identify the fixed points of the network, which should be same as those identified by differential equation based analysis. since it is impossible to enumerate all the states, we used a sampling strategy to define attractors and basins  which still captured the major events in the cell state space . the two condition signals in our model give three proper combinations since they are mutually exclusive and do not present simultaneously. we first randomly initialized the states without any signal, and follow their evolution to the stationary states. the percentage of the initial states converging to a specific attractor reflects the basin size of the attractor. without specifying signal, the basin sizes of the three attractors were comparable . when either cell cycle or sporulation signal is turned on, as expected, the cell prefers the corresponding attractor: under growth condition, 70% and 16% of initial states converged to cell cycle and sporulation attractors, respectively; under sporulation condition, these percentages were < <dig> % and 50%. under either condition, a significant portion of initial states converged to the "other" attractor , which illustrates the stochasticity in the network.

although it is prohibitive to calculate the stable probability of each state for the network of this size  <cit> , the attractors and basins identified by the sampling strategy still paint a global view of the cell state landscape, as conceptually illustrated in figure 2a. there are three major attractions: sporulation, cell cycle  and other. the yeast cell state is mainly determined by the environmental condition but stochasticity does exist to affect the cell fate. the attractions were robust subject to perturbations to the network structure by adding, deleting or switching direction of edges , and dynamic trajectories are more convergent in cell cycle than in sporulation .

predicting phenotypes based on genetic network
predicting sporulation efficiency
effect of deleting a single gene on the efficiency of yeast sporulation has been quantitatively assessed using microarray  <cit> : a prespo/spore ratio for each deletion strain is the ratio between the numbers of cells not-completing and completing sporulation. such a quantitative phenotype provides a unique opportunity to examine how well network-based predictions can be made in silico. we calculated the percentage of  <dig>  randomly sampled initial states that converge to sporulation attractor, i.e. an attractor with the spor node on, in wild-type and perturbed networks . a ratio between sporulation percentage in the wild type and a specific perturbation is computed as the prespo/spore ratio and compared with the experimental value.

we conducted single gene deletion for all the gene nodes in the network and the corresponding node was clamped to "0" in the simulations. the predicted sporulation efficiencies correlate well with the experimental values, as shown by a pearson correlation of  <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> given by t-test  and a spearman rank correlation of  <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  the lower spearman correlation is because most genes in the network are neither sporulation deficient nor efficient whose prespo/spore ratios crowd around  <dig> . to further confirm the significance of the correlation, we generated  <dig>  random networks, in which the number of nodes, each node's incoming- and outgoing-degrees, the numbers of each node's activators and repressors are same to the curated network . the correlations between the prespo/spore ratios and the predicted sporulation efficiencies based on the random networks only give a mean value of  <dig>  and standard deviation of  <dig> . compared to the random networks, the predicted correlation of the curated network is extremely significant .

this encouraging result suggests that  the most prominent interactions related to sporulation have been captured by the curated network even though about half of the nodes mainly function in cell cycle;  quantitative phenotypes can be predicted using the cell state landscape concept. there is room for improvement and we did observe three outliers in the predictions: rim <dig>  rim <dig> and clb <dig>  it is most likely that there are still missing regulatory interactions in the network. the simple boolean function may not be sufficient to capture complicated regulatory logics either .

predicting viability of mutation strains
we have collected the viability data on  <dig> mutants from the saccharomyces genome database  and the study of chen et al.  <cit> . to be viable, when started from the stationary g <dig> state triggered by cell size signal, the yeast cell should go through the cell cycle phases in the proper order. therefore, in the boolean network, a viable mutation state must  converge to the stationary g <dig> phase  through a trajectory containing all the right-ordered cell cycle phases, under cell growth condition. out of  <dig> mutants,  <dig>  predictions match with the literature , which gives satisfactory classification accuracy . to evaluate the significance, we predicted the viability of these mutant strains using  <dig>  random networks as those in the previous section. all mutations were predicted to be inviable. although the accuracy was  <dig> % , the mcc was zero, which suggests that the prediction is just random and insignificant. this satisfactory result shows that the curated network captures the major dynamics of yeast cell cycle and the synchronous updating scheme of boolean network is appropriate to study the dynamics of this system.

reprogramming cell fate
diverse recipes can achieve cellular reprogramming
the satisfactory results of predicting phenotypes based on the curated network encourage us search for perturbations to the network that may reprogram cell fate, e.g. yeast cells sporulate under growth condition or proliferate under sporulation condition. inspired by the generation of ips cells  <cit> , we searched for perturbation  combinations of  <dig> to  <dig> proteins that can achieve reprogramming. to mimic the generation of ips cells using transient perturbations, we initialized the perturbed proteins to "1" for overexpression or "0" for knockdown and then let the nodes evolve. there are  <dig> , <dig> possible perturbation combinations for the  <dig> proteins in the network. given a condition, we calculated the percentage of the  <dig>  randomly sampled initial states converged to the cell cycle or sporulation attractor with and without a perturbation. if a perturbation reverses the percentages of the wild type, reprogramming is achieved and the percentage of the targeted attractor defines the potency of the perturbation. interestingly, many such reprogramming perturbations  were found, which indicates the cellular plasticity  <cit>  and is consistent with the epigenetic landscape model that there exist various transition routes between two attractors  <cit> . the potency of reprogramming recipes for sporulation under cell cycle condition is much higher than proliferation under sporulation condition, which indicates the easiness of the reprogramming.

unsurprisingly, the most potent reprogramming perturbations are combinations of overexpression and knockdown. intuitively, the most effective way to reprogram cells from fate a to fate b would be repression of genes promoting fate a and overexpression of genes promoting fate b. for example, to reprogram yeast cells to sporulate under the growth condition, the top perturbation is overexpression of gcn <dig> and knockdown of rpd <dig>  sum <dig> and tup <dig> that achieves 97% of sporulation. in contrast, perturbations that only contain either overexpression or knockdown have much lower potency of reprogramming: the best overexpression- and knockdown-only perturbations respectively achieve  <dig> %   and 85%  of sporulation under the growth condition. similarly, all the top  <dig> recipes reprogramming sporulation to cell cycle under sporulation condition are combinations of overexpression and knockdown.

we next examined which perturbations are most frequently present in the recipes that achieve reprogramming . in both directions of cell fate reprogramming, perturbations to ime <dig> and tup <dig> have a dominant presence. ime <dig> is a major meiosis regulator and it is not unexpected that its overexpression under cell cycle condition or knockdown under sporulation condition helps reprogram the cell fate. tup <dig> represses many genes involved in a wide variety of physiological processes  <cit> . in our model, tup <dig> forms a complex with mig <dig> and activates rpd <dig>  both mig <dig> and rpd <dig> occur frequently in reprogramming recipes . the significance of rpd <dig> in reprogramming cell cycle to sporulation is in concert to the observation that rpd <dig> is a negative regulator of early meiotic genes and rpd <dig> deletion induces expression of early meiotic genes even in vegetative cells  <cit> . since mig <dig> is activated by abundant glucose in the environment  <cit> , under the sporulation condition, overexpressing mig <dig> mimics the presence of nutrient to drive the cells to grow. therefore, the importance of tup <dig> in reprogramming is likely due to its functional interactions with rpd <dig> and mig <dig> . sum <dig> represses the expression of ndt <dig> and other middle meiotic genes under growth condition  <cit> . it is not surprising that sum <dig> knockdown helps reprogram cells to sporulate under cell cycle condition. knocking down msn <dig>  a master regulator of stress response  <cit> , to reprogram yeast cells to proliferate under sporulation condition is also reasonable because msn <dig> is repressed by growth condition and it activates ime <dig>  the master regulator of sporulation.

kd: knockdown; oe: overexpression. perturbations are either gene knockdown or overexpression. see also additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

cellular reprogramming by perturbation and switch of condition
we examined how the fate of yeast cells can be reprogrammed by both perturbations and signals. first, under sporulation condition, we evolved  <dig>  random initial states, and only recorded the initial states and those on their evolving paths converged to the sporulation attractors, i.e. the states in the sporulation basin. we have sampled  <dig>  of such basins that include  <dig> , <dig> states in total. second, upon switching to the growth condition, we found that not all the states obtained in the first step evolved to the cell cycle attractor . the percentage of reprogrammed states among states with the same evolving distance to the sporulation attractors were calculated . obviously, the closer to the sporulation attractor , the less cells were reprogrammed when switching condition from sporulation to growth. specially, states within  <dig> evolving steps to the sporulation attractor never evolved to the cell cycle attractor for the wild type cells. it is consistent with the knowledge that yeast cells would complete sporulation once the commitment step is passed, even if they are transferred back to rich medium  <cit> .

we next selected the most potent  <dig> perturbations that can reprogram cells from sporulation to proliferation under the sporulation condition . in addition to each perturbation, we also switched the condition to growth. combination of perturbation and condition switching mimic the approach of generating ips or transdifferentiated cells, in which perturbations are introduced to cell type a and the cells are cultured in medium  for cell type b to reprogram cell type a to b. we grouped cell states based on their evolving distance to the sporulation attractor. the percentage of the states in each group that evolve to the cell cycle attractors for the wild-type and perturbed cells were obtained . the perturbation does facilitate reprogramming especially from the states that are at least  <dig> steps away from the sporulation attractors. however, most of the recipes still cannot reprogram cells within two evolving steps to the sporulation attractor . we conducted the same analysis on the other direction of reprogramming. when condition was switched from growth to sporulation, even the cell cycle attractor states could sporulate because it is a normal sporulation process for the wild-type cells but additional perturbations did boost the sporulation percentage .

the difference between the two reprogramming directions is biologically meaningful. yeast cells sporulating under sporulation condition is a natural process and additional perturbations facilitate its progress. in contrast, if yeast cells are committed to sporulation, switching back to proliferation under sporulation condition is cellular reprogramming that requires appropriate perturbations; even with reprogramming perturbations, the fate of yeast cells may not be changed if they are very close to complete sporulation . also, for the cell states with the same evolving distance to the sporulation attractors, not all of them can be reprogrammed . together, our observations indicate that cellular reprogramming may depend on the heterogeneity of the cell population. if the cells are completely specified in one cell fate, it may not be reprogrammable.

mimicking the generation of ips cell
it is almost impossible to convert a fully differentiated mammalian cell back to the pluripotent state by only switching culture medium. therefore, to mimic the generation of ips cell, we examined the reprogramming of the yeast cells committed to sporulation, i.e. cells within  <dig> evolving steps from any sporulation attractor that cannot evolve to cell cycle attractors by only switching condition. for the  <dig> most potent reprogramming recipes, we checked the percentage of the  <dig>  randomly sampled cell states that are committed to sporulation but can be reprogrammed to proliferation and we defined this percentage as the efficiency of the reprogramming recipe. obviously, the efficiency of a high-potency recipe is not necessarily high . potency reflects the fixed points of the network under a given environmental condition and reprogramming perturbation, and all initial states are considered when calculating the percentage of cell cycle attractors. efficiency defined here indicates the convergence to cell cycle attractors only from the cell states committed to sporulation.

under the growth condition, by random sampling of one million initial states, we found  <dig> cell cycle attractors and the existence of multiple attractors reflects the heterogeneity of proliferating cells. the reprogrammed cells converge to  <dig> to  <dig> of these attractors . because accumulating evidence suggests that the heterogeneity is critical for the function of embryonic and adult stem cells <cit> , we hypothesize that the proliferation heterogeneity of yeast cells is also selected by evolution to offer survival advantages. indeed, the  <dig> cell cycle attractors and the cell states within  <dig> evolving steps to them vary significantly on converging to the sporulation attractors when switching condition to sporulation . this observation indicates that the  <dig> cell cycle attractors are not equal in terms of their capability to sporulate in response to lack of nutrient in the environment. therefore, the reprogrammed cells would have different sporulation capabilities depending on which cell cycle attractors are restored.

a deviation metric was defined to measure how much the heterogeneity of natural cells is restored in the reprogrammed cells . the more similar the reprogrammed cells populate the cell cycle attractors as the natural cells, the smaller the deviation is. as shown in figure 5c, an efficient recipe does not necessarily have a small heterogeneity deviation, i.e. it does not restore the heterogeneity of the natural cells well. with respect to the reprogramming efficiency and heterogeneity deviation, five pareto optimal  <cit>  recipes were identified . for example, knockdown of ime <dig> and overexpression of mig <dig>  rpd <dig> and tup <dig> has a heterogeneity deviation of  <dig>  and efficiency of 26%. as discussed above, this perturbation boosts proliferation and inhibits sporulation. the reprogrammed cells repopulate three attractors  with similar percentages as the natural cells. this analysis highlights the importance of choosing the optimal reprogramming recipe.

reprogramming routes on the landscape of cell states
to illustrate how the reprogramming proceeds, we monitored the cell state transition for the wild-type and reprogrammed cells. first, under, for example, growth condition we randomly sampled states from the basin of a given attractor state . second, we evolved all the states in the previous step under the reprogramming perturbations and added all new states on the evolving paths to this state-transition graph. figure 6a and 6b show two examples of the state-transitions for both the wild-type and reprogrammed cells. it is obvious that the state-evolving paths are significantly altered by reprogramming perturbations and some nodes act as converging transition states . exactly as the landscape concept suggests, there are many transition routes between the cell cycle and sporulation attractors.

the common nodes in the reprogramming paths generated by different perturbations were identified transition states in reprogramming. for either reprogramming direction , the top  <dig> most potent reprogramming perturbations were used to construct  <dig> state-transition graphs sampled from  <dig>  random initial states. we then calculated a normalized state-transition flux for each state, defined as the flux flowing through the node divided by the number of nodes in the graph. in the  <dig> state-transition graphs, a transition state was defined as the one that was passed by at least  <dig>  reprogramming paths with an average normalized flux larger than  <dig>  . with this criterion, no transition state was found in the cellular reprogramming without condition switching, i.e. reprogramming from cell cycle to sporulation under cell cycle condition or from sporulation to cell cycle under sporulation condition. in contrast, transition states did exist for reprogramming with condition switching: three in the reprogramming from cell cycle to sporulation under sporulation condition and five from sporulation to cell cycle under cell cycle condition . the most prominent differences between the transition states of the opposite reprogramming directions are the activities of mig <dig> and rme1: both active in the reprogramming from sporulation to cell cycle but inactive in the opposite direction. as mentioned above, mig <dig> is activated by abundant glucose  <cit>  thus promotes mitosis, while rme <dig> inhibits meiosis by repressing ime <dig> expression and promotes mitosis by activating cln <dig> expression  <cit> . our observation suggests that major transition states may exist even though there are divergent routes of reprogramming generated by diverse reprogramming perturbations.

in the framework of cell state landscape, the reprogramming perturbations pull cells out of one attractor and push it over the barriers to another attractor. to illustrate the landscape, we employed a sampling strategy to estimate the potential of each cell state on the reprogramming paths . by defining the reprogramming path and transition states first, we avoided the extensive computation that is infeasible to conduct for a network of this size and devote our efforts to estimate the potential of states only on the reprogramming paths. figure 6c shows an example of reprogramming paths generated by different perturbations starting from two different cell cycle attractors. it is obvious that the barriers in the landscape are overcome by the perturbations.

discussion
a systematic approach to searching for reprogramming recipes
we propose here a systems biology approach to systematically search for recipes of reprogramming cell fate and understanding its mechanisms. our approach consists of the following steps. first, constructing a genetic network that regulates the cellular states of interest; second, appropriately representing the phenotypes using marker proteins/genes; third, making de novo predictions of phenotypes based on the network; fourth, searching for perturbations to the network that can reverse the phenotype percentages; fifth, estimating the potential of cell states on the reprogramming paths and find the transition states. in this study of budding yeast, our simulations match well with the experimental measurements and existing knowledge, which indicates the validity of this approach. it is no doubt that improvement can be made in our approach, particularly on constructing a more complete network and predicting phenotypes more precisely. more efficient methods are also needed to estimate potential landscape in the cells state space. nevertheless, we believe such a framework should be applicable to other systems such as generation of ips and transdifferentiated cells.

the genetic network with a reasonably large size  can provide mechanistic insights that are often missed by simplified circuits. we have further demonstrated the feasibility of predicting phenotypes from genetic network without additional prior knowledge . this observation is resonant to the proposal that the topology of biological network is dictated by its function  <cit> . although we take a simple boolean network to model the genetic network, it is likely that the network topology encodes the primary constraints of the functional regulations in the cell, which is crucial to de novo prediction of phenotypic consequences for perturbations to the system. tests on additional systems and various phenotypes are needed to further prove this hypothesis.

our approach allows monitoring of the reprogramming progress . consistent with the landscape concept, there are many recipes that can achieve a desired reprogramming. we show that recipes with combination of overexpression and knockdown are often more potent than the ones with only either overexpression or knockdown. as discussed above, this observation is quite intuitive but mixed perturbations have not been exploited in generating ips or transdifferentiated cells, likely due to lack of a systematic method to search for optimal reprogramming recipes. the approach we present here may allow identification of such recipes to effectively reprogram human cells from cell type a to b: knockdown of genes promoting type a and overexpression of genes promoting type b.

we find several transition states  in the reprogramming with condition switching, which is similar to the scenario in the generation of ips cells. similar to the checkpoint that yeast cells have to pass to commit to sporulation, mammalian cells often go through several checkpoints along differentiation. it is imaginable that the generation of ips cells probably needs to overcome several major barriers to achieve pluripotency. this speculation awaits experimental test and, if proved to be true, identification of such transition states would shed lights on understanding the mechanisms of both differentiation and reprogramming.

heterogeneity of cell population is crucial for cellular reprogramming
among the models for ips cell generation <cit> , the stochastic model predicts that most cells initiate reprogramming but only a small number complete reprogramming; in contrast, in the elite model only a small portion of cells can initiate and complete reprogramming. our analyses suggest a compromised model. if cells are fully specified to one cell state as shown in figure  <dig>  they may not be reprogrammable. due to the noise inside cell, the cell population showing a common phenotype are heterogeneous; a subset of the cell population that are not completely specified for a phenotypic state can all initiate reprogramming but only a portion of them can complete the desired reprogramming .

restoration of heterogeneity of natural cells by reprogrammed cells depends on reprogramming recipe
a critical question in cellular reprogramming is how much the reprogrammed cells resemble the natural cells. the functional roles of heterogeneity of embryonic and adult stem cells are recognized recently; it is believed that the mammalian cells have evolved to achieve such heterogeneity  <cit>  and our observation that the cell cycle attractors are not equal in terms of their capability to sporulate in response to sporulation condition is consistent with this hypothesis. as heterogeneity restoration depends on reprogramming recipes , we argue that an ideal recipe should fully restore such heterogeneity of the natural cells and the observed differences between ips and embryonic stem cells such as gene expressions may be partially due to the difference of their heterogeneity.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our proof-of-concept study on budding yeast illustrates the feasibility of systematic search for optimal reprogramming recipe and highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate recipe to achieve an effective cellular reprogramming. our analyses also demonstrate that a successful reprogramming may rely on the heterogeneity of the original cell type and suggest a compromised model for generation of ips or transdifferentiated cells. in addition, restoration of natural cells' heterogeneity by reprogramming is recipe-dependent and we propose such heterogeneity restoration may be critical to the functions of reprogrammed cells.
