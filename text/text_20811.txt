BACKGROUND
dna microarray technology allows investigators to monitor simultaneously the expression behavior of essentially all the genes within an entire genome and can provide information on gene functions and transcriptional networks. however, the large number of genes and the complexity of the underlying biological networks make extracting this information a formidable task. a common first step to interpret dna microarray data is to cluster the data on the basis of similarity of expression patterns. since genes with similar function often show a common expression pattern, clustering genes of known functions with poorly characterized genes provides a means of gaining insights into the functions of the latter  <cit> . furthermore, patterns seen in genome-wide expression data can reveal potential gene regulation networks and relate cellular processes to changes in cellular conditions  <cit> . however, the extent to which clustering reveals useful information about the system under study depends on the extent to which the clustering method successfully groups intrinsically related elements. example classes of clustering algorithms include  single and complete link hierachical clustering  <cit> ,  k-family of clustering algorithms  <cit> ,  optimization-based clustering approaches  <cit> ,  fuzzy clustering  <cit> ,  quality threshold clustering   <cit> ,  artificial neural networks for clustering, such as the self-organizing map   <cit>  and a variant that combines the som with hierachical clustering, the self-organizing tree algorithm   <cit> ,  information-based clustering  <cit> , and  stochastic approaches such as clustering by simulated annealing  <cit> . some of these algorithms, while novel in their own rights, suffer from certain shortcomings. for instance, the k-clustering methods require a user-specified cluster number. the qtclust approach is computationally expensive and assumes at each iteration that the largest cluster formed is necessarily the best grouping. and the simulated annealing approach requires a consistently good cooling schedule, subjective inputs for the upper bound cutoff distance and the allowable lower bound false negatives, and can become computationally more expensive than exhaustive search algorithms. whichever the clustering algorithm used, we need an intuitive and relevant tool to first assess the quality and significance of the clusters formed.

one approach to assess cluster quality is based on the idea that if the clustering result reflects robust structures, existing clusters should accurately estimate the appropriate cluster labels for new data points  <cit> .  <cit>  extend the prediction strength concept by proposing a figure of merit  measure, which describes the mean deviation of the gene expression levels with respect to the pertinent cluster centers. other methods of measuring cluster validity have also been proposed, such as the davies-bouldin validity index  <cit> , which is a function of the ratio of the sum of within-cluster scatter to between-cluster separation.

these approaches all rely solely on mathematical coherence to assess cluster quality. however, in uncovering biologically coherent structures from dna microarray data, categorizing gene clusters on the basis of known functionally related groups is very relevant. this provides useful insights into key biological themes among the genes and enables progress in the studies of gene regulatory networks and signal transduction pathways  <cit> . the biological coherence of each cluster can be scored according to the percentage of its genes covered by annotations significantly enriched in the cluster in question, using functional classification schemes in martinsried institute of protein sciences  or the gene ontology  databases  <cit>  to generate a p-value reflecting the likelihood that such enrichment would happen by chance. auxiliary to this central issue is the question of rigorously identifying and isolating outlier genes since it is highly probable that only a subset of genes participate in any cellular process or biological studies of interest. on the other hand, genes with similar expression profiles may not have common functional characteristics or expression profiles of genes in the same functional category may still be dissimilar due to the existence of unknown functional sub-categories and sparse or inaccurate functional annotations.

a remedy then is to integrate known biological knowledge into the clustering procedure itself. most knowledge-based clustering methods directly incorporate go knowledge into the algorithm. this assumes that the current go knowledge is correct because genes known to have a similar functional annotation are 'pushed' more closely to one another in a biased fashion. however, this could handicap the clustering process if the organism is sparsely annotated. methods that work solely on a modified distance measure  <cit>  can thus over-estimate the distances of the genes with unknown functions, thus depriving them of a chance of being 'discovered'. an alternative is to modify the similarity measure to be a linear combination of the expression profile similarity and functional similarity. this would however not work well with organisms that are not well annotated and is always highly subjective as to the contribution score of each similarity measure. another approach allows genes sharing common functions to have a common prior probability as compared to genes with different functions  <cit> . in an earlier work  <cit> , the clustering process is regulated by must-link constraints, which apply to genes with known common functions, and cannot-link constraints, which apply to genes known not to be associated with one another. this class of knowledge-based clustering algorithms could distort the 'chance' of genes with unknown functions to be fairly clustered. it also assumes that the current go annotations are accurate and comprehensive enough. a recent novel approach for knowledge-based clustering  <cit>  involves the use of selectively snipping the edges of a typical hierarchical clustering tree to induce clusters that are maximally consistent with available background information such as functional annotations. this method is tested and reported to outperform another recent knowledge-based clustering method  <cit> .

in addressing the various aforementioned concerns of many current knowledge-based clustering methods, we choose not to interfere with the measured distances of the genes or data points and instead cluster them based on the fundamental intuition that genes in the same cluster should behave similarly. then, we introduce a secondary refinement process using the go annotations to check the level of biological coherence of the clusters. we use the entire set of yeast go annotations available throughout our study. the iterative nature of our procedure means that if the go annotations are somehow wrong to begin with, subsequent iterations of our algorithm will still show a strong persistence in pushing seemingly 'unrelated' genes together, thus giving a hint that maybe these genes should have a common function after all. if the go annotations are unknown, then the unknown genes would be still fairly clustered with their counterparts, as their measured experimental behavior has not been tampered with. in organisms that are sparsely annotated, the emphasis on these intuitive factors such as unaltered distances and response correlation provides opportunities for  genes with known functions and verified with similar experimental behavior to be clustered together and  genes with unknown functions to find cluster membership in clusters with known functions if they correlate well or in clusters with unknown functions containing counterparts that show similar expression behavior.

our iterative clustering approach has as its backbone an optimization-based clustering algorithm, ep_gos_clust, presented in an earlier paper  <cit> . the algorithm is based on a variant of the gbd algorithm, the global optimum search   <cit> . this is a robust algorithm that compares favorably with many commonly-used clustering algorithm in defining clusters that are as dissimilar from one another as possible  while assigning members that are as similar to one another as possible into the same cluster . it also incorporates a methodology to predict the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset. in measuring the biological coherence of the clusters, we assert that the appropriate performance indicators are the cluster p-values and the proportion of genes that are in clusters of high coherence quality. the first reflects the functional richness of a cluster and is an intuitive measure of coherence, while the second reflects the potential to extract the maximum amount of useful information for subsequent studies of motif analysis and regulatory structure searches. we also look at cluster correlation and functional specificity as consistency checks. we then test our proposed method on three datasets of actual dna microarray expression results.

RESULTS
outline of proposed approach for uncovering biological coherence
our iterative approach extends a recently-proposed algorithm, the ep_gos_clust, as a backbone for clustering the expression data. specifically, we perform an initial clustering run on a given data as previously described to reach the optimal number of clusters  <cit>  and then apply a go analysis of the data to obtain a preliminary assessment of the level of biological coherence. those clusters that exhibit better biological coherence than a prescribed benchmark value are retained as seeds for the next round of clustering. as a consistency check, we also look at cluster correlation and specificity. those genes that fall into clusters lacking the benchmark level of coherence are subjected to a subsequent round of ep_gos_clust clustering, in which each gene is placed either in an existing cluster having a similar expression profile or aggregated with other unclustered genes having similar expression profiles to form a new cluster. this overall process is repeated until we observe an asymptotic saturation either in the optimal number of clusters or the proportion of genes that are placed into clusters with strong levels of biological coherence. the approach is described in greater detail in the methods section.

dataset i
dataset i consists of dna microarray data obtained from a study in the role of the ras/protein kinase a pathway  on glucose signaling in yeast  <cit> . the ras/pka signal transduction pathways provide a major conduit to couple cellular responses to the availability of carbon sources such as glucose  <cit> .  <cit>  measure the levels of rna for each of the  <dig> yeast genes over time in wild type and various mutant strains following glucose addition to cells grown on a non-fermentable carbon source. these experiments are designed to assess the extent to which the ras/pka pathway mediated transcriptional effects induced by glucose. 

each of the eight test and control experiments consist of four time points over a hour period, yielding  <dig> data points for each of the  <dig> genes. before clustering the array data, we filter the data to remove unreliable data. in particular, we retained all genes for which all the time points are deemed present by the affymetrix software suite , all the genes for which greater than 50% of the time points are deemed present and all the genes for which the present/absent calls exhibit a consistent and biologically relevant pattern . in all, we retain  <dig> genes.

clustering dataset i using the ep_gos_clust algorithm described previously  <cit>  results in  <dig> optimal clusters, out of which  <dig> were singleton clusters. we perform a go analysis of the clusters and determined that 64% of the  <dig> genes fall into clusters with significant functional coherence . ignoring the singleton clusters, we also find that the average cluster size is  <dig> , while the average size of clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> or less is  <dig> , thus indicating that clusters formed using the ep_gos_clust do not show strong biological coherence just because of a size bias. in fact, the average size of clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> or less is only  <dig> . we select as a cut-off standard a p-value of 10- <dig>  which encompass  <dig> clusters containing a total of  <dig> genes. reclustering the remaining  <dig> genes by another round of ep_gos_clust decreases the optimal number of clusters to  <dig>  out of which 81%  of the genes fall into clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> or less. after  <dig> iterations of this process, we find that the optimal number of clusters saturated at  <dig>  with over 90% of the genes falling into clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> or less. we also find that the proportion of genes that fall into clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> or less increases from 32% to 69%. figure  <dig> illustrates the results of the clustering process. as evident from this figure, the proposed clustering method yields a monotonic increase in the average -log <dig> values and in the proportion of genes that found placement in quality coherent clusters, as well as a steady decrease in the optimal number of clusters, indicating the growing compactness and economy of the clustering. we further note that over 75% of the genes that were placed into singleton clusters for the first iteration remain in singleton clusters throughout suggesting that these genes are biological outliers. we also compare our clusters with that obtained using representative methods from the k-family of clustering approach  <cit> , the self-organizing map   <cit> , a variant that combines the som with hierarchical clustering, the self-organizing tree algorithm   <cit> , and the qt-clust method  <cit> . table  <dig> shows that just the ep_gos_clust backbone already compares favorably against the other methods, and that the iterative approach further refines the cluster quality. in short, this iterative method clearly provides a means of enhancing the biological coherence of clusters obtained from microarray data.

shown are the comparative biological coherence formed by various clustering methods on dataset i. the  <dig> shaded rows represent clustering done by the standalone ep_gos_clust backbone and the proposed iterative approach.

dataset ii
we examine a second dataset derived from experiments designed to determine comprehensively the contribution of different signaling pathways to the glucose response in yeast. in addition to the ras/pka pathway, at least three other signaling pathways mediate transcriptional changes attendant on addition of glucose to cells  <cit> . in one pathway, glucose addition leads to reduced activity of the amp-activated protein kinase encoded by snf <dig>  thereby unfettering a transcriptional repressor encoded by mig1/ <dig> and suppressing several transcriptional activators  <cit> . the second pathway, mediated by rgt <dig>  couples expression of the hexose transporter genes to the level of available glucose. binding of glucose to plasma membrane glucose sensors promotes degradation of repressors of hexose transporter genes by the scfgrr <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex, allowing rgt <dig> activation of these genes. finally, the agc kinase sch <dig> acts in parallel to pka to induce expression of many genes normally regulated by pka  <cit> . to test the roles of each of these pathways, we measure expression changes following glucose induction in wild type and mutant cells lacking specific components of the different pathways. levels of rna for each of the  <dig> yeast genes in each of the rna samples are assayed using agilent microarray chips, out of which measurable signals are registered from  <dig> of them. this dataset consists of results from  <dig> time course experiments, each with 2– <dig> time points. 

clustering of dataset ii using ep_gos_clust results in  <dig> optimal clusters, out of which  <dig> are singleton clusters. as before, we find the singleton clusters to be poorly related to the other genes, with a low average correlation coefficient of only  <dig> . we perform a go analysis of the clusters and note that 79% of the  <dig> genes fall into clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> or less and 66% of the genes fall into clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> or less. this in itself already represents a highly robust quality of clustering. as a separate analysis, we ignore the singleton clusters and find that the average cluster size is  <dig> , while the average size of clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> or less is  <dig> , thus indicating that clusters formed using the ep_gos_clust are unlikely to show strong biological coherence just because of a size bias. in fact, the average size of clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> or less is only  <dig> . for this dataset, we select as a cut-off standard a p-value of 10- <dig>  which gives  <dig> clusters containing a total of  <dig> genes. we apply the proposed methodology to improve the biological coherence of our clusters and found that after  <dig> iterations, the optimal number of clusters saturates at  <dig> , with 84% of the genes falling into clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> or less . we highlight that this is less than the final gene placement of over 90% obtained for dataset i for two main reasons. first, dataset ii is drawn from a larger number of dna microarray experiments and has  <dig> feature points compared to  <dig> for dataset i, thus introducing a greater range of variability within the data. second, we imposed a stricter cut-off p-value of 10- <dig> or less, as opposed to the previous choice of 10- <dig>  figure  <dig> summarizes the utility of our proposed methodology in improving cluster validity and placing the largest possible proportion of genes into biologically coherent clusters. we also find that the mean -log <dig> value of the clusters increases monotonically from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

shown are the percentages of genes in clusters in which one or more subsets of the genes in the cluster exhibit a statistically non-random membership in a common biological function, as defined by gene ontology  classification, either at a significance level of 10- <dig> or 10- <dig>  either uncorrected  or bonferroni corrected for multiple hypothesis testing . the values are for the clusters obtained following initial ep_gos_clust clustering or after six round of the iterative algorithm described in methods.

at completion of the iterative process, we obtain  <dig> clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> or less, containing  <dig>  of the original  <dig> genes. we note that these clusters exhibit a tight grouping, as evidenced by a visual inspection of the gene expression time course plots , as well as the relatively high values of correlation coefficients for these clusters .

comparison of clustering methods for dataset ii
we examine the coherence of the clusters obtained by our iterative version of ep_gos_clust versus the non-iterative version as well as other clustering methods. these include the well established k family of partition-based clustering algorithms  <cit> , self organizing tree algorithms   <cit>  and a recently proposed information theoretic-based method   <cit> . as can be seen from the results in table  <dig> the initial iteration of ep_gos_clust performs as well or better than any of these other methods, whether corrected for multiple testing or not, as measured both by the percent genes resident in clusters with high biological coherence and by the average expression correlation within individual clusters. moreover, the clusters from the final iteration of the algorithm exhibit a higher level of expression correlation. thus, the iterative ep_gos_clust compares favorably with other clustering methods.

methods include ep_gos_clust backbone, the iterative algorithm described in this report, the k-family of partitional clustering algorithms with pre-assigned clusters, self organizing tree algorithm , and mutual information based clustering   <cit> . data in the upper table are presented as described in the legend to table  <dig> while the lower table presents data on expression correlation within clusters and the average -log values for biological coherence over all the clusters.

function prediction based on expression profiles
an application of any clustering approach is the ability to predict the functions of unknown genes by clustering them together with counterparts with known functions. this is a particularly important consideration when working with organisms that are not as well-annotated as yeast. we test the capability of our proposed iterative procedure in this respect through a simulated study. we do this by randomly de-annotating 20% and 30% of the genes in dataset ii. we then apply our iterative clustering approach to the entire dataset ii and take into consideration the entire set of functional annotations reported on the sgd. naturally at each iterative step, the clusters are scored as if the de-annotated genes have no known function, thus affecting the p-value. as a result, we find that our iterative procedure demonstrates a  <dig> % level of prediction accuracy for the dataset with 20% de-annotation and  <dig> % for the dataset with 30% de-annotation. we feel these results compare favorably to the other knowledge-based clustering methods reported in the literature  <cit> . these methods report a prediction accuracy of between 30–70%. however, these accuracies are found using restricted datasets of only 2– <dig> function classes  and clustering is done up to 10– <dig> clusters. furthermore, we observe there is very little variation in the percentage of prediction accuracy as our algorithm steps through the iterations. as a case in point, the prediction accuracy for the 20% test case in the  <dig> iterations it took for the optimal number of clusters to stabilize is  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and finally  <dig> %. this and the relative high level of prediction accuracy by our iterative algorithm is a result of the clustering not being driven by the extent of known functional annotations, which can handicap the clustering process if the data is sparsely or wrongly annotated, but rather by fundamental indicators of cluster goodness. hence, we expect the clustered results from a de-annotation simulated study or a go permutation study to not severely affect the final results.

motif identification
another means of evaluating the effectiveness of our clustering regimen is to determine the extent to which it reveals information regarding the underlying transcriptional network responsible for the observed pattern of transcription. for instance, are genes in specific clusters enriched for motifs corresponding to transcription factors known to be involved in regulation under the conditions tested? several methods are available to identify motifs enriched in groups of genes and we applied a recent method – fire, which uses the concept of mutual information to predict functional motifs from gene expression data  <cit> . we compare the results obtained on this dataset clustered as described above with that from an expanded version of the same dataset clustered by k-means with a cutoff correlation of  <dig>  . both sets of clusters reveal the role of the pac/rrpe motif, sites for the transcription factors msn2/ <dig>  mbp <dig>  rap <dig> and rpn <dig> as well as the 3' rna binding factor puf <dig>  the k-means clusters also reveal a role for gcn <dig>  hap <dig>  reb <dig> and cbf <dig> while our iterative algorithm identifies bas <dig> and mig <dig>  all these factors have been implicated in glucose regulation and the overlapping but non-identical results with the two cluster sets indicates the value of interrogating an expression dataset with multiple clustering methods.

abridged iterative approach
we examine the capabilities of an abridged version of our iterative algorithm. in the standard ep_gos_clust algorithm, we allow the formation of singleton clusters as a strategy to identify and isolate genes that are clear outliers. mathematically, these singleton clusters have p-values of zero. since it is reasonable to assume these genes play little or no part in the biological/cellular process of interest, having been put through a rigorous placement process, we drop these genes from future consideration instead of retaining them in the dataset for the iterative sorting process. as a result, the initial iteration on dataset ii results in  <dig> optimal clusters. we then apply a p-value cut-off of 10- <dig> or less as above, confirm the poor correlation of the singleton genes with the other genes, and then remove these from further consideration. we perform the same set of iterations and arrive at  <dig> as the final optimal number of clusters after only  <dig> rounds, out of which  <dig> are singleton clusters. of these,  <dig> clusters have p-values of 10- <dig> or less, as compared to  <dig> when using the full methodology. nonetheless, table  <dig> shows that the abridged method yields comparable results to the complete approach except in placing genes into clusters bonferroni-corrected p-values of 10- <dig> or less. hence, as long as hypothesis testing errors are not a concern, the abridged proposal is valid and useful.

data are presented as described in the legend to table  <dig> 

minimal expression level for meaningful clustering
gene expression measurements typically contain a certain amount of noise, which can come from hybridization errors due for instance to chip imperfections, as well as stochastic fluctuations in transcriptional processes. these are typically filtered by the appropriate microarray software, as described in the methods section. as another area of interest, we then ask ourselves, noise aside, whether there can still be a minimal level of fold change for a particular gene to be considered relevant and can be meaningfully clustered.

we assume that for any particular gene's expression to be relevant, it should show a significant level of expression variation over at least 1– <dig> experiments. for dataset ii, which contains  <dig> experiments, with 2– <dig> time points each, this corresponded to about 10% of the time points. applying an arithmetic mean regression to this dataset yields a  <dig> -fold change cut-off as the condition in which genes would demonstrate significant variation for at least 10% of all time points . from this, we derive a feasible region for fold-change cut-off by combining the constraint brackets of a time point allowance of at least 5–20% and the number of genes showing a reasonable level of intensity variation . we then cluster dataset ii using several of these fold-change criteria candidates. specifically, we parametrically test for   <dig> -fold change for at least 5% of time points –  <dig> genes,   <dig> -fold change for at least 10% of time points –  <dig> genes,   <dig> -fold change for at least 10% of time points –  <dig> genes, and   <dig> -fold change for at least 15% of time points –  <dig> genes. the results from this analysis are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig> and figure  <dig> 

we compare the effects on genes retention and correlation results of within-cluster elements after clustering dataset ii by the iterative algorithm.

we compare the effects on biological coherence of genes within clusters of dataset ii obtained by the iterative algorithm.

the first observation from tables  <dig> and  <dig> is that the results of clustering improve significantly after undertaking some form of gene expression relevance threshold. the second observation is that an over-strict and over-lenient fold-change threshold results in the respective deletion of useful information or the retention of non-information. as can be seen from table  <dig>  even though a cut-off criterion of  <dig> -fold change for at least 10% of all time points results in the least number of genes and the best clustering economy in placing the genes into a lowest number optimal clusters, it does not result in the best overall correlation between members within the same clusters and clusters of the strongest biological coherence. on the other hand, the criterion of  <dig> -fold change for at least 10% of the time points appear to produce the tightest clusters with the highest level of biological coherence despite having the largest number of genes as compared to the other fold-criteria tests. this is particularly noticeable from table  <dig>  where it places the largest proportion of genes into coherent clusters, but also has the smallest proportion of genes leftover for the weaker clusters. in addition, while this criterion does not lead to the lowest number of clusters, the resultant data groupings exhibit the strongest correlation. this leads us to conclude that a  <dig> -fold cut-off for at least 10% is probably the appropriate screening criteria for dataset ii.

we then assess the clusters using a newly-proposed functional genomics gold standard based on an expert curation of the gene ontology  <cit> . this allows us to assess our iterative process using only go terms that are deemed specific enough to imply a meaningful biological relationship between any two annotated proteins. the iterative clustering of dataset ii with a  <dig> -fold cutoff gives a final  <dig> optimal clusters, of which  <dig> are quality clusters with p-values below the cut-off of 10- <dig>  we performed a gold standard go analysis of these  <dig> clusters and found that  <dig> of these returned meaningful annotation results based on this standard, and that the average precision and recall values of these clusters was  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . this significantly exceeds the average background of  <dig> %. on the other hand, the average precision and recall values of the non-adjusted version of dataset ii of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, showing that the fold-change cutoff helps in improving the meaningfulness of the clustered results.

dataset iii
natural genetic variation can cause significant differences in gene expression, and clustering and linkage analysis can yield meaningful insights on how natural polymorphisms affect gene regulation. we test our iterative clustering approach on dataset iii, which is obtained by measuring the expression levels of all yeast genes in a laboratory and a wild strain, and in  <dig> segregants from a cross between them  <cit> . the dataset consists of multiple replicates of parental strains and single arrays for each of the segregrants using spotted microarrays, yielding  <dig> experiments each with  <dig> gene expression measurements. these genes correspond to  <dig> known yeast genes, as well as  <dig> dubious orfs and  <dig> control spots. 

unlike the previous two datasets, which were obtained under controlled experimental conditions, dataset iii is a much more diverse set of expression conditions, rendering it more challenging to cluster. clustering dataset iii using ep_gos_clust results in  <dig> optimal clusters. we note that even at this level, the cluster correlation and biological coherence compares favorably against previous hierarchical clustering results  <cit> , which for a minimum pair-wise correlation of  <dig>  yields  <dig> clusters of at least two genes containing a total of only  <dig> genes out of the original  <dig>  as a test, we first adopt a multi-stage approach with progressive filtering to cluster it. the rationale for this approach is that successively extracting the higher correlated clusters allows subsequent clustering in the absence of these strong attractors. the scheme we follow and the results of that process are outlined in figure  <dig> 

the process of sequential clustering allows us to identify a total of  <dig> genes in  <dig> quality clusters  that annotates for known biological functions, as well as  <dig> clusters  that contain  <dig> genes of unknown biological processes. this compares favorably both in coverage and compactness with the  <dig> genes sorted into  <dig> clusters by the hierarchical clustering method previously applied to this dataset. furthermore, application of our iterative clustering approach at two instances  allowed us to improve cluster quality, in terms of member correlation, cluster precision, and p-value. the iterative approach also improves the number of genes placed into good clusters. for instance, for group a, the number of genes falling within clusters with p-values of 10- <dig> and below improves from  <dig> to  <dig>  while for group e, the number goes from  <dig> to  <dig> 

we evaluate the clustered results in two ways. first, as described for the previous dataset we apply fire to extract regulatory motifs associated with individual clusters. second, we applied linkage analysis to the clustered expression data to determine whether the pattern of expression in a particular cluster could be associated with an unlinked site in the genome. this process identifies genes whose product would likely be acting in trans to modulate expression of genes in a particular cluster  <cit> . the results of these analyses are presented in figure  <dig> and summarized in table  <dig>  as evident from this summary, the serial clustering approach yields highly coherent clusters, both in expression correlation and in biological function, even in the third round of clustering . moreover, analysis of the genes clustered by this method identifies most of the cis-acting motifs and the trans-active sites that had been extracted from this dataset previously. in addition, the fire analysis of the clustered data identifies a number of enriched motifs in the 3' sequence of genes, which have not been extracted previously from this dataset but which correspond to a number of previously noted motifs associated with mrna stability, including puf <dig>  puf <dig> and prse, as well as a motif associated with the pau gene family of unknown function  <cit> . as previously recognized, the trans-acting factor that affect expression of genes in a cluster generally does not correspond to the transcription factor associated with the motifs enriched in genes in that cluster. rather, these trans-acting factors predominantly define physiological processes – mating type  or prototrophy , for example – or signaling networks – ira <dig>  ira <dig>  ras <dig> or gpa <dig> – that impinge on the expression patterns indirectly. in this context, though, it is intriguing to note that the same allele variation in a trans-acting can induce multiple, distinct expression patterns, witnessed by the fact that the same locus is linked to several different clusters. this would suggest that the factor may work in combination with other loci segregating in the cross to yield a variety of transcriptional patterns. such polygenic effects are expected but have only begun to be rigorously explored.

genes in dataset iii are clustered by ep_gos_clust through a sequential process outlined in figure  <dig>  genes in cluster groups a and e are further clustered by the iterative algorithm, yielding an initial and final set of clusters. precision is defined as the fraction of genes within a cluster assigned to the predominant functional group within that cluster.

cthere are no applicable initial values here since the remaining genes to be clustered are subjected to the second filter before being re-clustered into the initial  <dig> clusters .

next, as a test of our iterative procedure, we subject dataset iii to this algorithm without any intermediate filtering or multi-stage processing. from the initial clusters obtained from the first round of clustering, the iterative procedure results in  <dig> optimal clusters after  <dig> iterations, based on a p-value cutoff of 10- <dig>  a subsequent analysis of the clusters reveals results comparable to that obtained from the application of intermediate filtering as described previously. the large clusters that annotate for major functions such as translation, ribosome biogenesis, cellular component organization, and chromatin assembly appear in both instances, and have about 60% of their member genes in common. the smaller clusters that annotate for flocculation, cytokinesis, vitamin b <dig> metabolism, rna-mediated transposition, and sterol biosynthesis far even better, with 75% of common genes recovered in both cases. the average specificity of the clusters obtained by using just the iterated procedure is 33%, which compares well with the 25–75% specificity range  obtained earlier. we also note the uncovering of several clusters whose majority of genes have unknown biological processes. in both applications, the cluster specificity is high – an average of 33% compared to a range of 40–60% by using multi-stage clustering with intermediate filters. in addition, the number of clusters obtained  is similar to the total of  <dig> quality clusters retained by the previous application. we note however that the optimal clusters obtained by using just the iterated approach without any filters is lower – an average of  <dig>  versus  <dig> . this and the comparatively lower cluster specificity is understandably the result of the two filters implemented in the former process, including one that involves correlation filtering. nonetheless, the recovery of several common-function clusters with overlapping genes leads us to believe that our iterative approach would be effective in uncovering clusters with a strong level of biological coherence even without applying various levels of additional filtering to a dataset.

CONCLUSIONS
uncovering biological insights from dna microarray data is a promising but challenging task. generally, the first step in organizing and analyzing microarray data is clustering genes into groups related by expression patterns, which often then reveals biological coherence. in our study, we observe that the task of placing genes into strongly coherent clusters may not necessarily be achieved with a single round of clustering, no matter how robust the clustering algorithm has proven to be. to address this limitation we formulated a methodology that filters out the genes placed in clusters of weak biological coherence and iteratively seeks the best placements for these genes. we show that on the whole our proposed algorithm unambiguously refines the biological quality of gene clusters. the extent of improvement over the iterations is significant, from a 20% increase in the number of genes in biologically coherent clusters for dataset iii to a 40% increase for dataset i. we note also the increasing level of average cluster correlation as the iterative sorting progresses. the latter observation is significant, since cluster correlation is not a factor explicitly used in the algorithm to target clusters for recycling.

we apply this algorithm to a variety of datasets. two of these datasets are strongly focused on the question of nutritional regulation in yeast. we select the third dataset as a test for this method since, due to experimental design, it is as diverse a collection of expression patterns as any in the literature . we evaluate our results from the second dataset against those obtained by a number of standard clustering algorithms and find that our method assigns a higher proportion of genes to biologically coherent clusters than any of the others. moreover, the average expression correlation of genes in the clusters is higher by our method than by any of the others. in addition, subsequent analysis of the clusters reveals a strongly overlapping set of predictions for cis-acting regulatory sequences to that obtained from clusters generated by other methods. our results with the third dataset also compare favorably with other methods. our algorithm, applied in a multi-stage fashion, assigns  <dig> genes to  <dig> clusters compared with  <dig> genes in  <dig> clusters previously compiled by hierarchical clustering with a correlation value cutoff. this reduced number of clusters facilitates subsequent analysis of the data while retaining essentially all of the information content, as assessed by analysis of linkage to trans-acting factors and identification of cis-acting regulatory domains.

an issue with incorporating annotative knowledge is that the clustering process can be limited when applied to datasets from sparsely or inaccurately annotated organisms. in this respect, our iterative procedure still performs comparatively well under these situations. on its own, the clustering backbone ep_gos_clust compares favorably against several well-known clustering algorithms based on not just the usual quantitative attributes but also the level of biological coherence based on go resources. the procedure has as its pre-processing step a complete clique search  amongst the data points for strong pre-clusters. in our iterative procedure, go knowledge is not considered during the clustering itself, but rather in post-processing and cluster refinement steps. the clustering backbone thus considers only intuitive quantitative attributes, so a lack of functional annotation does not affect the result as adversely as other more involved knowledge-based clustering approaches. the iterations then smooth any distortions brought about by issues with existing annotation databases or measurement inconsistencies.

based on the results of this study, we believe our work to be valuable in uncovering biologically meaningful data structures. since the complex functions of a living cell are carried out through a concerted activity of many gene and gene products, it is important to be able to effectively cluster dna microarray data to uncover functional relationships and regulatory modules to help understand the complex biological mechanisms involved in signaling.
