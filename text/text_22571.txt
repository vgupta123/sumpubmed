BACKGROUND
malaria parasites infect and kill millions of people in the tropics each year  <cit> . efforts to develop vaccines have so far failed to produce any effective vaccine. additionally, drug-resistant parasites are spreading quickly, particularly parasites resistant to chloroquine, leading to a recent resurgence of malaria in many developing countries  <cit> .

to facilitate our understanding of parasite molecular biology and development of drugs and vaccines, the genome of the malignant human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum was sequenced and published in  <dig>  <cit> . the genome sequence provides a basis for various genome-wide approaches such as microarray and proteomic analyses  <cit> . unfortunately, the majority of the genes in the p. falciparum genome were predicted using computer software, with ~60% of the predicted genes encoding hypothetical proteins  <cit> . although software 'trained' with well characterized genes and improved strategies have provided relatively accurate gene prediction  <cit> , the accuracy of gene prediction of this organism is unknown. it is therefore necessary to verify the predictions with complementary dna  sequences, particularly for eukaryotic organisms that have introns in their genes. indeed, full-length cdna clones from many species from drosophila to human have been collected and characterized  <cit> , providing important information for verification of genes in a genome and for studying gene functions. recently, when a high-density array was used to survey transcribed exons, up to 30% of the detected transcripts were found to be unannotatd even in the well characterized drosophila genome  <cit> .

p. falciparum has a unique genome with a very high at content   <cit>  that presents various difficulties for studying gene structure and gene function. the extremely high at content in non-coding regions  is often an obstacle to obtaining sequences from introns, 5' and 3' untranscribed regions , and intergene sequences. p. falciparum dna is often unstable in bacteria, making it almost impossible to obtain full cdna clones from genes larger than  <dig> kb for expression or other analyses. approximately 50% of the genes in the p. falciparum genome were predicted to have introns flanked by the conserved eukaryotic gt-ag intron-exon splice sites  <cit> . the parasite genome also has many large open reading frames  that likely encode large transcripts; however, introns imbedded in the orf cannot be ruled out  <cit> . the elements regulating gene expression such as promoters and polya recognition sites seen in other eukaryotic cells may not function properly in this parasite due to the high at content in noncoding regions  <cit> .

expressed sequence tags  from malaria parasites, particularly p. falciparum, have been obtained previously  <cit> . the first survey of p. falciparum est produced  <dig> tags from  <dig> random cdna clones  <cit> ; and the number of est was later increased to ~ <dig>   <cit> . more recently,  <dig> single random sequences were obtained from a library enriched for full-length cdna  <cit> , which were updated to  <dig> sequences covering  <dig> predicted genes  <cit> . cdna sequences from the full-length cdna clones  identified new genes and multiple transcript initiation sites in some genes, but it appeared that no efforts were made to obtain complete cdna sequences from full-length cdna clones. in this report, we constructed various cdna libraries from mixed blood stages, including three cdna libraries with different sized inserts enriched for full-length transcripts and sublibraries that contain smaller clones after digestion of the initial inserts with restriction enzymes. we also used synthetic oligonucleotides to extend sequences deep into coding regions. we obtained a total of  <dig> clean est. comparison of our est, the est in public databases, the predicted coding sequences , and genomic dna sequences identified  <dig> genes that may be incorrectly predicted.

RESULTS
cdna libraries and dna sequencing
collection of est from p. falciparum has been reported previously, and searches of public databases found  <dig> p. falciparum est in plasmodb  <cit>  and genbank, contributed by various research groups  <cit>  . the majority of est collected previously were short sequences from single sequencing reads. to obtain longer cdna sequences, we used two different approaches–primer-walking and construction of sublibraries of restriction enzyme-digested dna clones–to extend sequence reads into the cloned dna. three different libraries, each with three sublibraries of different insert sizes, were constructed using polymerase chain reaction  products after  <dig> cycles of amplification . the first library contained cdna clones directly from 5'-enriched cdna inserts, which were divided into groups of large , medium , and small  insert sizes . unfortunately, we were not able to obtain sequences from either 5' or 3' ends of many clones from this library, probably due to polya or polyt sequences in non-coding regions, suggesting that these clones may contain full coding sequences. we then constructed sublibraries with dna inserts digested with restriction enzymes bamhi or sau3a before cloning into the vector .

sequence trimming and contig assembly
a total of  <dig> sequence runs–including  <dig> from 'full-length' libraries,  <dig> from bamhi-restricted libraries,  <dig> from sau3a-digested libraries, and  <dig>  runs from primer walking–were performed. from the sequence runs, we obtained  <dig> est  <dig> base pairs  or longer  after trimming and vector sequence cleaning . because of difficulty in obtaining sequences from at-rich sequences in non-coding regions and sequences with polya tails, most of the sequences were from digested libraries or from the 5' ends of the undigested libraries. the trimmed est from our libraries were assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons with an average size of  <dig>  bp and an average qual value of  <dig> . when our est were assembled with est in public databases, we obtained  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons with an average size of  <dig> bp.

genome-wide cdna coverage
to determine patterns of genome-wide gene expression and locations of est on chromosomes, we assembled our est and the public est with  <dig> predicted cds in plasmodb  and displayed them on the physical chromosomes . when assembled using cap <dig>  <cit>  ,  <dig> cds were assembled with est contigs. when the sequences were aligned using blast and methods described previously  <cit> ,  <dig> cds were identified by the same est with cutoff values of at least 100-bp long and 95% identity. the two methods produced almost identical numbers of hits on predicted cds. this percentage of genes  with est coverage is a little higher than those detected using a 70mer oligonucleotide array   <cit> . among those est matching cds, approximately 42%  were matched by est from both our collection and those in public databases.

alignment of cdna to predicted genes on physical chromosomes allowed us to identify chromosomal regions that are transcriptionally active or silent. our results show that genes located at telomere or subtelomere regions of many chromosomes  do not have matching cdna or are largely silent . the chromosome ends of p. falciparum are highly variable, consisting of many multigene families such as rifin, stevor, and var  <cit> . although the functions of the proteins encoded by rifin and stevor are still uncertain, the var gene family has been shown to encode variant proteins  that can mediate parasite adhesion to receptors on host endothelial cells  <cit> . different observations on the expression of the genes at chromosomal ends have been reported using microarray hybridization, with one reporting silent chromosome ends  <cit>  and another suggesting expression of genes from chromosome ends  <cit> . because microarray is based on probe-target hybridization, cross hybridization among probes from members of gene families could produce false-positive signals under some hybridization conditions. our data are consistent with results showing that rna transcripts from only a small subset of these genes could be detected in intraerythrocytic stages  <cit> . additionally, there are regions in the middle of the chromosomes with genes that do not have cdna coverage .

full-length cdna sequences and discovery of new introns
one of our goals was to collect complete cdna clones and sequences from the p. falciparum genome. unfortunately, we encountered difficulties in sequencing highly at-rich regions, mostly 5' and 3' utr, and obtained only  <dig> contigs that cover the entire orf of  <dig> predicted genes, with predicted orf sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . among the  <dig> genes,  <dig>  were predicted incorrectly , with  <dig> genes having  <dig> additional introns and  <dig> genes with cdna sequences running into predicted introns. of the  <dig> new introns,  <dig> were found 5' of the predicted atg, suggesting either additional exons or introns in the predicted non-coding regions. assembly of our est and those in public databases increased the number of genes 'fully' covered by est to  <dig>  with  <dig>  genes having mismatched introns . if we assume an error rate of gene prediction for the whole genome similar to that seen in the  <dig> fully covered genes, we would expect  <dig> genes  being predicted erroneously. this is quite a large number of predicted genes that may have to be re-annotated, which argues for efforts to experimentally annotate the genome using full-length cdna sequences.

ch, chromosome; no genes, numbers of genes; mis intr, numbers of genes with introns not matching those predicted; new intr, numbers of new introns found; lost intr, numbers of introns that may not exist as predicted; size changes, numbers of introns with sizes that do not match those predicted; as intr, numbers of introns that may be alternatively spliced. most known genes are housekeeping genes, consistent with expression profiles.

approximately half of the p. falciparum genes  were predicted to contain introns  <cit> . our data suggest that the percentage of genes with introns will be higher than the predicted 54%. among the  <dig> genes found to have new introns in cdna,  <dig> were predicted to have no introns, and one gene predicted to have only one intron actually had none. this represents a net gain of  <dig> genes with introns among the  <dig> genes . among the  <dig> genes with mismatched introns from the  <dig> genes with full coverage of predicted coding sequences,  <dig> genes gained introns , based on these data, we can predict that about 60% to 65% of the genes in the p. falciparum will have one or more introns. of interest, the majority  of the new introns were found at 5' and 3' utr or within  <dig> bp from a predicted atg or stop codon, suggesting additional exons or changes of start or stop codons. it is also possible that the proposed genome sequence contains insertion/deletion errors causing apparent frameshift. automatic prediction algorithms would then have to find an intron/exon border adding one spurious intron.

alignment of our cdna contigs with predicted cds also identified  <dig> genes, although not fully covered by our cdna sequences, with  <dig> introns either missed by computer prediction or predicted incorrectly . among them,  <dig> genes have  <dig> introns missed by computer prediction;  <dig> genes have falsely predicted introns ;  <dig> genes have  <dig> introns larger than predicted; and  <dig> genes have  <dig> introns smaller than predicted. there are also three predicted genes  that have cdna sequences extending into their neighboring genes . these predicted gene pairs are  <dig> bp or less apart on the chromosomes. it is likely that the 3' utr of the genes will be longer than  <dig> bp, particularly for gene pairs pfb0610c/pfb0605w and pfl2160c/pfl2155w with orf in opposite orientations. similarly, assembly of our and public est with predicted cds and genomic dna increased the number of genes having incorrectly predicted introns to  <dig>  with  <dig> new introns found and  <dig> introns having sizes different from those predicted . these genes will require further experimental verification with complete cdna sequences.

ch, chromosome; no genes, numbers of genes; new intr, numbers of genes with new introns; lost intr, numbers of genes with predicted introns, but not confirmed with cdna; larger intr, number of genes with introns larger than predicted; smaller intr, number of genes with introns smaller than predicted; as intr, introns potentially alternatively spliced. antisense, numbers of antisense transcripts based on the presence of conserved intron splice sites  in antisense orientation.

confirmation of conserved gt-ag intron splicing sites and alternatively spliced introns
all the introns confirmed by our cdna sequences have typical eukaryotic gt-ag splicing sites except a few genes that have potential 'introns' lacking gt-ag. these atypical 'introns' could be due to deletion during cloning in bacteria. for example, a  <dig> bp gap was found at  <dig> bp 5' of the atg in gene mal13p <dig> , but no gt-ag sites were found in the gap. gaps without gt-ag sites can be due to either deletion during cloning in bacteria or sequencing errors, although it cannot be ruled out that some introns may not have the conserved gt-ag sites. to investigate this possibility, we designed pcr primers flanking the 497-bp gap in mal13p <dig>  and confirmed the absence of the  <dig> bp gap . similarly, gene pfl0290w has a gap of  <dig> bp without gt-ag sites within the predicted orf; we could not confirm the gap, either. it is clear that gaps without gt-ag sites are unlikely to be true introns. this observation also shows that sequences, including coding regions with relatively high gc content, can be deleted during cloning in bacteria.

ch, chromosome; gen, expected sizes in base pair from genomic dna; spl, expected sizes in base pair if introns are spliced out. pfl0020w has a cdna with  <dig> bp intron having gt-ag sites inside an orf, but no spliced band was detected using pcr. similarly, pfl0290w has a  <dig> bp gap without gt-ag sites; this gap was not confirmed. primers for pfe <dig> cover two introns, so multiple forms were expected. indeed, three transcripts of different sizes were found in one of the introns.

alternative splicing has been well documented in many organisms  <cit>  including malaria parasites  <cit> . we noticed that many predicted introns were covered with est contigs that may or may not have the predicted introns, suggesting potential alternatively spliced introns , in addition to some cdna that showed introns of different sizes; however, we could not rule out that those cdna contigs without introns were from contaminated genomic dna sequences. to verify these introns, we synthesized primers to amplify some alternatively spliced introns suggested by the cdna sequences . the majority of these introns  were either present or absent in sequence alignments, e.g., contigs with some sequences running into the predicted introns. results from pcr confirmed  <dig> alternatively spliced introns out of  <dig> genes tested, including genes with more than two forms of transcripts .

antisense transcripts
antisense transcripts are present in the cdna collections. because of our cdna cloning strategies , the orientation of our cdna clones was not preserved; however, there were transcripts with introns that had conserved gt-ag intron splice sites in the orientation opposite to the predicted genes . these transcripts matched the genomic dna sequences but with introns having the conserved gt-ag sites in the opposite direction, suggesting antisense transcripts. of interest, dna sequence encoding gene pfl1420w  was matched by two cdna contigs, one in sense and the other in antisense orientation. the sense sequence had an intron that matches the predicted intron with conserved gt-ag splicing sites. the antisense contig also had an intron with conserved gt-ag sites, but was  <dig> bp smaller than the predicted sense intron . translation of the antisense sequence produced a polypeptide with  <dig> amino acids that had good homology with n-terminal sequence of myosin ixa protein, which could represent a new gene. the presence of these antisense cdna is consistent with previous reports of antisense transcripts in the parasite  <cit> , but the functions of the these transcripts are largely unknown.

functional classification
the est contigs matching cds predictions were grouped as functional categories according to go molecular functions. as expected, the majority of the genes with functional assignments were housekeeping genes . almost all genes with functional assignment among the  <dig> genes fully covered with est  were housekeeping genes encoding proteins related to transcription, translation, and other basic cell functions such as ribosomal proteins , histone proteins , or proteasome proteins  . based on this observation, we can predict that the majority of the  <dig> hypothetical genes in additional file  <dig> are likely housekeeping genes.

potential new genes
there were also contigs and est sequences that match neither the nuclear genome nor the mitochondrial and plastid genomes . some of these sequences might be parasite dna sequences that were not represented in the finished p. falciparum genome. similarly, there were sequences that match genomic dna but not the predicted cds. these sequences could represent new genes or non-coding sequences of intergenic/intron/utr that require further investigation. for sequence information, linked files and detailed annotation for all the est contigs, please visit  <cit> .

there are also many predicted orf larger than  <dig> kb in the p. falciparum genome. the sizes of these large orf/genes are probably off the limit of cloning stability in bacteria and in vitro extension capability of reverse transcriptase. in addition, high at content in the dna is an obstacle for obtaining good-quality dna sequences from pcr products. more efforts with new strategies will be required for obtaining full cdna sequences for the large genes.

CONCLUSIONS
although our est data are still limited, this work obtained  <dig> high-quality cdna sequences that almost double the current est collection in public databases. our effort to extend sequences into cdna clones allows us to assemble some relatively long cdna sequences and to correct some erroneously predicted introns. our data suggest that considerably large numbers of genes in this parasite genome may have incorrect intron/exon predictions, arguing for more efforts to collect complete cdna sequences and reannotate the genome with cdna sequences. this study also confirms the conserved eukaryotic intron splice site  at the parasite introns, shows the presence of relatively large numbers of alternatively spliced and antisense transcripts, and reveals silence loci at subtelomeric regions of many chromosomes. the cdna sequences presented here will provide useful resources for genome annotation and analyses of gene expression.
