BACKGROUND
in poultry industry, egg weight has always been an economically important trait, and is usually regarded as the major breeding objective and research goal . as a sensory feature at first glance, egg weight demonstrates a critical impact on consumption due to diverse preferences towards size worldwide  <cit> . for breeders, egg weight has been reported to affect chick quality including hatching weight, fitness and performance  <cit> . notably, owing to the significant effect of hen age, egg weight shows consecutive increase during the whole laying period  <cit> . eggs with extreme size in the later stage may obstruct automatic packing and consumption. therefore, investigation of the genetic architecture underlying egg weights at different ages would have both economic and biological importance.

multiple lines of evidence have suggested that egg weights are mainly determined by genetic factors and they all show considerable heritability estimates  <cit> . currently,  <dig> quantitative trait loci  involved in egg weight, located on  <dig> different chromosomes, have been deposited in the animalqtldb . however, a majority of reported qtls are mapped with wide confidence intervals by low-density linkage analysis in the past  <cit> . in general, it is very difficult to identify potential causal variants in qtl mapping studies, mainly due to the relatively small number of recombinants generated from two original parents in a limited number of generations  <cit> . to improve the precision of gene-level mapping, genome-wide association study  based on linkage disequilibrium  between snps and causal qtls/genes is proposed as a more powerful approach identifying genetic links between phenotypes and genotypes  <cit> . so far, two leading studies have successfully refined associated intervals affecting egg weight via moderate-density snp chips  <cit> . recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies enable the discovery of a large number of snp markers as well as the development of high-density snp platforms  <cit> . in chickens, the availability of 600 k affymetrix chicken snp array could contribute to narrowing down candidate genomic segments and pinpointing several dominating causal variants.

despite the great advantages of gwas, most studies to date utilized only phenotypes measured at a single time point . in practical genetic studies, some traits can be measured repeatedly over a period of time, and how to analyze these longitudinal data has received increasing attention . recently, the longitudinal gwas has been proposed to assess whether some significant snps are associated with the process that a trait develops over time  <cit> . numerous studies have provided growing evidence that the longitudinal design could offer the opportunity for the identification of time-dependent and consistent loci  <cit> . moreover, joint analyses for measurements at multiple time points could increase the statistical power over cross-sectional approach  <cit> , owing to their effectiveness in incorporating the correlation structure of multiple measurements and alleviating the multiple testing burden  <cit> . genome-wide assessment of longitudinal egg weight data would be beneficial to distinguish between genetic contributions reflecting constant and specific effects.

in the present study, we implemented univariate, multivariate and conditional gwass using 600 k affymetrix chicken snp array in a total of  <dig>  f <dig> chickens with observations for egg weights at different ages. in addition, we examined the genetic architecture of egg weight by partitioning genetic variation according to chromosome. the main goals of our current work were to assess the feasibility of longitudinal data as an intriguing resource in gwas, pinpoint associated loci and genes that contribute to the phenotypic variability and longitudinal trend in egg weight, and provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of longitudinal egg weights.

RESULTS
phenotype statistics and genetic parameters
descriptive statistics for nine egg weight variables are presented in table  <dig>  we observed that egg weight displayed a curvilinear increase with advancing hen age. particularly, all phenotypic values conformed to the normal distribution after rank-based inverse normal transformation, and these transformed values were used for all primary analyses. we quantified the additive genetic variations in liability to egg weights at different ages captured by all eligible gwas markers. univariate gcta analyses revealed that all egg weight traits, except first egg weight , had highly heritable patterns , and the highest snp-based heritability estimate was found in ew <dig> . moreover, bivariate gcta analyses indicated that egg weights at multiple ages were highly and positively interrelated, especially for egg weights at two neighboring time points. as the beginning of entire laying stage, few showed slightly lower genetic correlations with egg weights at the following ages , compared with those among egg weights from  <dig> to  <dig> week of age .table  <dig> descriptive statistics for nine egg weights in the f <dig> population

identification of candidate loci by gwas
as a preliminary, we conducted nine separate association tests using univariate method for longitudinal egg weights. in total,  <dig> genome-wide significant snps located on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were successfully identified for these nine traits . these excess signals of association were entirely attributable to two chromosomal regions  and a single locus . of all significant association signals,  <dig> snps were responsible for only one trait and other  <dig> hits affected multiple phenotypes. in particular, four loci around rs <dig> were found to be implicated in all egg weights except few. the global view of the putative p-values for all snps affecting ew <dig> is given in fig.  <dig>  and the manhattan and quantile-quantile  plots for the remaining traits are provided in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the genome-wide discovery analyses yielded a small genomic inflation factor  for each egg weight, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . after adjustment by sample size, the standardized λ <dig> values varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these results indicated negligible inflation of the observed genome-wide association signals caused by population stratification. notably, moderate deviations within the upper tail of the distribution were found in all qq plots, in spite of stringent quality control and inclusion of up to top five pcs. thus, the departure due to a great number of weakly associated snps was indicative of polygenic inheritance.fig.  <dig> manhattan plot  and quantile-quantile plot  of the observed p-values for egg weight at  <dig> weeks of age . the manhattan plot indicates -log <dig>  for genome-wide snps  plotted against their respective positions on each chromosome , and the horizontal green and black lines depict the genome-wide suggestive  and significant  threshold, respectively. for quantile-quantile plot, the x-axis shows the expected -log10-transformed p-values, and the y-axis represents the observed -log10-transformed p-values. the raw and adjusted genomic inflation factors  are shown on the top left in the qq plot



in total, we obtained  <dig> genome-wide suggestive loci from nine independent univariate analyses. to enhance the statistical power, a joint gwas analysis of nine traits was performed by fitting these snps into a multivariate model. consequently, a total of seven significant hits on gga <dig> and gga <dig> provided compelling evidence for associations with longitudinal egg weights . we then performed stepwise conditional gwass to prioritize separately associated snps owing to the potentially strong linkage disequilibrium  between neighboring variants. after two-round adjustment in the multi-traits gwass, two significant snps, rs <dig> on gga <dig> and rs <dig> on gga <dig>  were uncovered to be independent signals. meanwhile, another locus, rs <dig>  on gga <dig>  survived the genome-wide suggestive threshold of multivariate model. considering that rs <dig> and rs <dig> are separated by  <dig>  mb and the pair-wise ld between them is relatively low at d’ =  <dig>  and r2 
=  <dig>  , we treated rs <dig> as another separate signal. taken together, we obtained three significantly independent loci associated with all egg weights from multivariate analysis.

after that, we repeated conditional analyses in the single-trait model, through including the three aforementioned alleles as covariates in an orderly manner . after two-step univariate conditional tests on rs <dig> and rs <dig>  the third snp rs <dig> was still significantly associated with all traits except few. this locus seemed to have independent effects on these traits, despite that it showed only suggestive significance inferred by two-round multivariate conditional gwass. the finding further strengthened the validity regarding rs <dig> as an independent hit. it should be noted that the significance levels of loci nearby the peak signals were substantially attenuated after adjusting for the three independent hits. in order to provide visual support of independent associations, we interrogated the signals in the  <dig>  mb genomic region surrounding the independent loci . since rs <dig> and rs <dig> affected more phenotypes, we illustrated their regional association plots for ew <dig> and ew <dig> to compare the difference of putative significance levels before  and after  conditioning on the two hits. moreover, conditional analyses on three aforementioned hits revealed that an additional snp rs <dig> on gga <dig> remained significantly involved in ew <dig>  therefore, we performed further analyses conditional on the genotype at rs <dig> site and found no more genome-wide significant signals. finally, the four loci were considered as independent associations with longitudinal egg weights after a set of three gwass.fig.  <dig> regional association plots of two loci associated with ews at  <dig> and  <dig> week of age . for each plot, the -log <dig>  of snps  are presented according to their chromosomal positions . the horizontal red line depicts the genome-wide significance level . the significant snp after univariate, multivariate and conditional gwass is represented by a red diamond and is labeled by its rs number. a regional association results for ew <dig> before  and after  conditioning on rs <dig>  b regional association results for ew <dig> before  and after  conditioning on rs14916609




allelic contribution to phenotypic variation
for the four resulting loci, the allelic substitution effects and phenotypic variance explained by them were estimated for nine egg weight traits . the minor allele at each locus is treated as the effect allele according to the gemma definition. the effect alleles at two snps, rs <dig> and rs <dig>  were associated with the increase in egg weights at each time point, as opposite to other two variants. the genetic effects of the each allele at multiple ages had the same direction but slightly discordance, suggesting the presence of potential time-dependent impact. through fitting the four variants into mixed model simultaneously, they together explained  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance for few and  <dig>  ~  <dig>  % for ew from  <dig> to  <dig> week of age. notably, rs <dig> exhibited the largest allelic substitution effect on egg weight at each age. at nine different ages, substituting one copy of allele a by allele g at rs <dig> site would cause  <dig>  to  <dig>  sd/allele increase in egg weight, in which the sd represents the standard deviation of ew at corresponding age. the corresponding phenotypic variance explained by this variant ranged from to  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. we compared the actual phenotypic difference between three genotypes at each locus and found that the three phenotypes showed significant segregation . the comparative results revealed that the homozygote of effect allele possessed the highest or lowest egg weight at the same time point and the heterozygote are medium, suggesting that individual phenotype was more severely affected by homozygous effect allele. it should be noted that the homozygote of effect allele at rs <dig> site showed unstable ews with advancing hen ages compared with the heterozygote and the homozygote of alternative allele, and other three snps yielded concordant change trends for egg weights at multiple ages.table  <dig> contributions of four associated snps to egg weights at different ages

annotation of significant snps
gene annotation of the four significant snps allowed us to identify genes related to longitudinal egg weights. considering that the putative variants may be in high ld with a causal locus genuinely associated with phenotype, we inferred the ld block around the sentinel snp using haploview. four blocks containing the four hits were identified and the detailed information is summarized in table  <dig>  to investigate the functional characteristics of the four blocks, we scanned these regions with biomart system. five different genes overlapping with the blocks were integrated into final gene set. the vep tool revealed that the four snps were encompassed by four aforementioned genes, and three of them lies within introns and one resides in exon . notably, a snp, rs <dig> significantly present at the lowest minor allele frequency, is a non-synonymous mutation in exon  <dig> of ncapg and mediates a valine-to-alanine amino-acid substitution . according to the putative sift score , the change of amino-acid was predicted as tolerated to protein structure and function.table  <dig> genomic regions surrounding four significant snps

genome partitioning of genetic variation
we implemented an exploratory analysis through partitioning the genetic variation onto chromosome segments to further illustrate the genetic architecture of egg weight. owing to relatively small sample size in the f <dig> population, parameter estimates for some traits in the joint model could not converge. however, the strong genetic correlations between nine egg weight phenotypes provided evidence that they had great potential to share a consistent genetic architecture. therefore, we only exemplified the partitioning spectrum of ew <dig> due to its highest heritability. the estimates of variance contributed by each chromosome exhibited a strong linear relationship with the length of the chromosome for ew <dig> , and no chromosome was found to show exceptional contribution. for three chromosomes, gga <dig>  gga <dig> and gga <dig>  each of them explained more than  <dig>  % of phenotypic variance, demonstrating higher genetic contributions than other chromosome segments . to quantify the effects of the four resulting variants on ew <dig>  we fitted these snps as covariates and repeated the genome partitioning analysis. when compared with the results before adjustment, we found that the variance explained by gga <dig> dropped from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % . the same estimate for gga <dig> showed the largest decrease from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. particularly, a slight reduction in the estimated proportion of variance captured by gga <dig> was found, and the estimates for other  <dig> chromosomes almost remained the same.fig.  <dig> genome partitioning for egg weight at  <dig> weeks of age  by joint analysis. a the estimated proportion of variance captured by each chromosome against its size. the characters in the circles are the chromosome numbers. b contributions of gwas snps partitioned by chromosome. the whole bars indicate the estimates of variance explained by each chromosome, in which the three wheat bars represent the same values by four resulting loci



discussion
although many genetic contributions to egg weight at a single time point have been unearthed by general gwas approach  <cit> , less is known about genetic architecture of longitudinal egg weights. to elucidate potential genetic loci that affect egg weight over time, we conducted comprehensive genome-wide association analyses for egg weights at multiple time points in an f <dig> segregating population, by utilizing the high-density 600 k snp arrays. the current work not only provided a pioneering genome-wide association scan shedding light on longitudinal egg weight data, but also could deepen our understanding of genetic architecture underlying how egg weight develops over time. through incorporating the associated loci into human-engineered breeding programs, we can select eggs with proper sizes to meet consumer needs, and help to predict the weight change in the following production.

currently, conducting gwas in an f <dig> population has been a routine approach to detect causal loci and genes  <cit> . gwas approach is generally based on ld patterns in experimental populations, and the population structure is an important factor influencing the extent and range of ld  <cit> . three previous studies  <cit>  suggested that crossbred populations show a smaller extent and rapider decay of ld by distance as well as smaller haplotype block size than pure lines. the lower level of ld could enable that the associated snps are located in close proximity to the casual locus due to the tight linkage between them. therefore, the f <dig> population and high-density array in our study would be beneficial for high-resolution mapping of genuinely causal loci.

all qq plots displayed moderate leftward deflections of the observed distribution, suggesting the presence of numerous weakly associated variants. this phenomenon is often attributed to “spurious inflation”, and would be expected under polygenic architecture  <cit> . genetic analyses by gcta tool revealed highly heritable patterns of egg weight. the high snp-based heritability estimates showed that a substantial proportion of phenotypic variance could be captured by eligible gwas snps, providing compelling support for polygenic model. meanwhile, the strong genetic correlations between nine egg weight phenotypes indicated that these traits may share the similar genetic components or be influenced by some pleiotropic genomic regions  <cit> . the results were also supported by the fact that the four independent snps exerted consistent effects on all egg weights. in poultry industry, maintaining good stability without significant increase after laying peak is another great concern  <cit> . we previously conducted a genetic analysis for the increment traits of egg weight with advancing hen age  <cit> , in which the increment of ew was defined as the difference between two ews at neighboring ages. the low heritability estimates reflect that ews at different ages may share similar genetic causes, and calculating the difference values may eliminate the same additive effects between them. therefore, according to the two studies by us, how to improve the stability in egg weight seemed to be a considerable challenge by general genetic methods.

to further decipher the heritable architecture in egg weight, we partitioned the genetic variance onto different chromosomes based on estimated chromosomal grms  <cit> . notably, three macrochromosomes gga <dig>  gga <dig> and gga <dig> accounted for the largest genetic variance , producing corroborative support for the gwas results that four loci on them were identified as significant associations with egg weights. moreover, a strong and positive linear correlation between variance explained by chromosomes and their length was found, suggesting the presence of a large number of genomic loci mediating weak effects  <cit> . the finding again consolidated the polygenic pattern in egg weight, and was consistent with other traits in animals  <cit>  and human  <cit> . the result reflected that longer chromosomes are likely to occupy more informative and effective markers, leading to a polygenic nature of egg weight  <cit> . overall, despite that there were four snps with relatively large effects contributing to longitudinal egg weights, and our results demonstrated that many genetic variants each with a small effect widely spread across the whole genome. to pursue additional genetic loci with small or modest effect sizes, a larger population and high-throughput sequencing technology would be required.

compared with some previous strategies leveraging only cross-sectional phenotype data , we took advantage of longitudinal egg weight data at nine time points. in total, we captured four promising loci with strong evidence for influencing egg weight over time. while we failed to detect some time-dependent variants, again suggesting that egg weight at different stages was likely to be affected by the same genetic loci. regarding the four snps, only rs <dig> was discovered to be responsible for all phenotypes except few via nine univariate analyses. this result indicated that the separate use of cross-sectional measurements might miss several loci which had weak effect sizes at one time point but large effects at other stages  <cit> . cross-sectional surveys only identified time-dependent loci, but not provided insights into how such factors influenced traits over time  <cit> . the longitudinal method was capable of permitting the investigation of genetic variants with consistent effects  <cit> . in addition, univariate analysis for ew <dig> discovered a novel effective locus missed by multivariate method. the reason could attribute to smaller effect sizes of this mutation at other ages that had low power to uncover it. moreover, it should be noted that multivariate test only used individuals with intact data records at each time point  <cit> . considering that the number of analyzed individuals was  <dig> in multi-trait analysis, only one half of total sample size, thus some missing phenotypes at different ages may have a negative impact on the investigation of candidate variants  <cit> . in consequence, to enhance the power detecting variants with consistent effects, we must enable more complete phenotypic information for each individual.

in total, four ld blocks tagged by the resulting snps were inferred, and contained five candidate genes of potentially functional relevance. two snps  on gga <dig> are segregated by  <dig>  mb and located in the intronic regions of cab39l  and fkhr , respectively. the cab39l gene has been proposed to participate in the mtor signaling pathway. it is increasingly apparent that mtor signaling can affect most cellular functions as a central controller of cell growth  and proliferation  <cit> . numerous studies have reported that fkhr is a member of foxo subfamily and an important mediator of the insulin signaling pathway  <cit> . this pathway could stimulate protein synthesis and cell growth by activation of mtor  <cit> . for birds, the unfertilized yolk is a single cell , and the deutoplasm part will be gradually accumulated during oogenesis. the polymorphisms in the two genes may result in the change of egg weight through influencing the deposition of yolk and egg white.

a non-synonymous mutation  located within the ncapg  was unveiled in the current study. in chickens, many independent studies reported that multiple genomic segments containing this gene were identified to be implicated in both egg weight and body weight  <cit> . however, a recent study revealed that another candidate gene cckar  located around  <dig>  mb away from ncapg is mainly responsible for body weight  <cit> , by establishing a 16-generation advanced intercross line  between a fast and a relatively slow growing strain. because accumulated recombination events in the ail are expected to provide better resolution for qtl mapping  <cit> , cckar might be a more promising causal gene. notably, the gene ncapg has been suggested to be associated with many growth and weight traits in several livestock species . therefore, we could not ignore the potentially conserved function of ncapg for body weight in chicken, owing to a particularly interactive relationship between egg weight and body weight  <cit> , i.e., the larger egg would cause higher hatch weight and the heavier chicken would produce larger eggs. we speculated that ncapg gene may exert a pleiotropic effect involved in the two phenotypes simultaneously. consequently, the impact on body weight of the gene for egg weight identified by us requires further investigation.

another gene cdadc <dig>  is located about  <dig>  kb upstream of snp rs <dig>  but its function and mechanism is not yet clear. one previous study indicated that this gene may be an important factor regulating testicular development and spermatogenesis in human  <cit> . due to its function on reproductive performance, we suspected that the gene may highlight a potential role on oogenesis. on gga <dig>  a gene kcng <dig>  indexed by rs <dig> encodes a subunit of the potassium voltage-gated channel. it is known to be mainly involved in cell volume and smooth muscle contraction  <cit> , and these biological functions may reflect potential connection with changed egg weight due to different alleles.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we performed univariate, multivariate and conditional gwass for longitudinal egg weight data using high-density 600 k snp arrays, and suggested that longitudinal analysis had higher power to dig out variants that influence phenotype variability over time. our study provided evidence that egg weight appears to be highly heritable and polygenic, and shares the similar genetic determinants and mechanisms at different ages. four significant loci and five candidate genes were detected with significant effect on egg weights. in particular, ncapg may influence both egg weight and body weight simultaneously in a pleiotropic manner. these promising loci and genes could be helpful to engineer practical breeding programs and produce the desired egg size according to diverse consumption markets.
