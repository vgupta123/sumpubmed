BACKGROUND
a variety of viruses cause diseases in humans, and viral infections affect millions of people each year. the treatment and prevention of viral infections and their associated diseases are the main public health challenges. common examples of viruses associated with human diseases include hiv- <dig>  influenza virus, human papillomavirus , herpes virus, and hepatitis a, b, c, d and e viruses. different viral species have different infection mechanisms, and identifying host cell proteins that are attacked by a virus will certainly help better understand the infection mechanism and to design new antiviral strategies. recently, proteome-wide studies of viral interactions with human proteins were performed, but comprehensive analysis of the interactions between virus proteins and human proteins involved in viral infection has not yet been investigated.

so far, most computational studies of protein-protein interactions  have focused on the interactions between proteins of the same species. for example, bock and gough  <cit>  created protein structural and physiochemical descriptors based on the sequence data, and trained a support vector machine classifier to identify ppis from the descriptors. there are many other studies that used a support vector machine to predict ppis in several organisms  <cit> .wu et al.  <cit>  used the gene ontology  and other annotations to predict ppis in yeast. nanni  <cit>  predicted ppis in the human gastric bacterium helicobacter pylori by combining a linear discriminant classifier and cloud points. you et al.  <cit>  used a manifold embedding method to assess and predict ppis. all these methods are intended for the protein-protein interactions within a species rather than for those across different species. methods typically used to predict interactions between homogeneous proteins are not appropriate for predicting those between heterogeneous proteins, since such methods do not distinguish interactions between proteins of the same species from those of different species.

in this paper, we propose a representation method and a support vector machine  model to predict the interactions between two types of viruses  and human proteins. although substantial progress has been made in clinical and basic research on the hepatitis c virus  and human papillomaviruses , interactions between these viruses and human proteins are not yet fully understood. identifying more interactions between them should help elucidate the interaction mechanism of hcv and hpv with host cells, and can be helpful in designing molecules that target the new interacting proteins.

methods
representation of protein sequences
one of the challenges in predicting protein-protein interactions from sequences is to find a way of fully encoding the important information content of protein sequences. in addition, the amino acid sequences of different lengths should be transformed into a feature vector of the same length. we represent a protein sequence using three consecutive amino acids called amino acid triplet. for example, in the amino acid sequence tvavtva, there are four overlapping amino acid triplets, tva, vav, avt and vtv. to reduce the dimension of the vector space of feature vectors, we represent an amino acid sequence using the class of amino acids. based on the biochemical similarity of amino acids, twenty amino acids were classified into six categories: {ivlm}, {fyw}, {hkr}, {de}, {qntp}, and {acgs}  <cit> . using this classification of amino acids, there are 6×6× <dig> =  <dig> possible amino acid triplets.

we use a binary space  to represent a protein sequence, in which v is a vector space of feature vectors with a fixed number of features and f is a vector space of frequency vectors. a protein sequence of variable length is first mapped to a feature vector of fixed length. a feature vector v is then mapped to a relative frequency vector di , which is defined by equation  <dig> 

  di={efi−min{f <dig> f <dig> ...,f216}max{f <dig> f <dig> ...,f216}−min{f <dig> f <dig> ...,f216}}− <dig> 

where fi is the frequency of the i-th triplet type in the sequence. the value of di ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> .

there are two differences between our representation and that of shen et al.  <cit> , namely in the classification of amino acids and in the definition of the relative frequency of an amino acid triplet. first, shen et al.  <cit>  clustered the  <dig> amino acids into seven classes, {avg}, {ilfp}, {ymts}, {hnqw}, {rk}, {de}, {c}, based on the diploes and volumes of the side chains of amino acids, and there are 7×7× <dig> =  <dig> possible amino acid triplets. second, the relative frequency of a triplet in their representation is defined by equation  <dig> 

  di=fi-min{f <dig> f <dig> …,f343}max{f <dig> f <dig> …,f343}-min{f <dig> f <dig> …,f343} 

while the relative frequency in the representation of shen et al.  <cit>  has a value in the range  <dig> <cit> , it ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  in our representation. thus, the relative frequency value in a wider range makes it easier to discriminate protein sequences as we will show later in the results section.

in addition to the relative frequencies of amino acid triplets, a feature element representing the types of virus proteins  were included in a feature vector. each feature vector was labelled + <dig> for interaction and - <dig> for non-interaction. by encoding the type of a virus protein, the svm model can find a human protein interacting with the virus protein.

support vector machine
a support vector machine  has been applied to several biological problems such as prediction of protein-protein interactions  <cit> , homology detection  <cit> , and analysis of gene expression data  <cit> . data examples labelled positive or negative are projected into a high-dimensional feature space using a kernel, and the hyper-plane in the feature space is optimized to maximize the margin between positive and negative data examples. we implemented an svm model using libsvm http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ with the radial basis function  as a kernel function, which is defined by

  k=exp 

where u and v are two data vectors and γ is a training parameter. a smaller γ value makes the decision boundary smoother. the regularization factor c controls trade-off between a low training error and a large margin  <cit> . in this study, we set c =  <dig> and γ= <dig> .

we tried several other kernel functions with our data. the linear and polynomial kernel functions resulted in high sensitivity , but low specificity . the sigmoid kernel function showed poor performance both in sensitivity and specificity . the radial basis function was the only one that showed reasonably good sensitivity and specificity, and chosen as the kernel function of the svm model.

data set of viral interaction with human proteins
hepatitis c virus  is a small enveloped virus with a single-stranded rna genome encoding a single open reading frame  <cit> . the polyprotein of approximately  <dig>  amino acids is cleaved into the structural proteins , hydrophobic peptide p <dig>  and non- structural proteins such as ns <dig>  ns <dig>  ns4a, ns4b, ns5a and ns5b  <cit> . although many experimental studies have been performed so far, the underlying mechanisms controlling the entry of hcv into host cells and interactions with the host cells are not fully known, and an efficient treatment for hcv infection has not yet been developed.

we obtained the interaction data between hcv proteins and human proteins from the infection mapping project   <cit> . i-map provides a comprehensive view of viral infections at the protein level by mapping the interactions of a large amount of viral proteins with host proteins. there are  <dig> interactions between  <dig> hcv proteins and  <dig> human proteins. by searching gene ids of the  <dig> human proteins in hprd http://www.hprd.org, we identified a total of  <dig> interactions between hcv proteins and human proteins. the  <dig> protein-protein interactions formed a positive data set for an svm model. both positive and negative data are required to train an svm model. unlike positive data, negative samples are not readily available from protein-protein interaction data. we randomly selected  <dig> human proteins from hprd, which were not included in the positive data set, and generate a negative data set with them. our method of generating a negative data set is similar to that of gomez et al.  <cit> , which assumes a negative protein interaction if there is no explicit evidence of an interaction. since an unbalance between positive and negative data sets introduces a prediction bias, we generated a negative data set with the same number of proteins as the positive data set.

for evaluating an svm model, we divided both the positive and negative data sets into training and test sets. we randomly selected  <dig> positive data and  <dig> negative data for a training set. the remaining  <dig> positive data and  <dig> negative data were used to construct a test set. to keep the same proportion of human proteins interacting with each virus protein in both training and test sets, we selected training data by

  ni=n⋅nn 

where ti is the i-th virus protein , n is the number of human proteins interacting with the i-th hcv protein, n is the total number of positive training data, and n is the total number of hcv-human protein interactions.

hhcv represents the human proteins that are known to interact with hcv proteins. for each hcv protein, the number of hhcv in a training set was computed by ni=n⋅nn, where ti is the i-th hcv protein.

human papillomavirus  is a member of the papillomavirus family of viruses that is capable of infecting humans. hpv types  <dig> and  <dig> cause 70% of cervical cancer  <cit> . so far, a small number of host proteins have been known to interact with hpv proteins, so a systematic prediction of large-scale interactions between hpv proteins and human proteins would help find new human proteins targeted by hpv. we extracted the interactions of hpv- <dig> and hpv- <dig> proteins with human proteins from the ncbi biosystems database . after removing redundancy, we identified a total of  <dig> interactions of hpv proteins with human proteins, and obtained gene ids from hprd http://www.hprd.org. a training set and test set for hpv interactions were constructed in the same way as for the hcv interactions. table  <dig> shows the numbers of human proteins known to interact with each hpv protein and those used to train an svm model for hpv interactions.

hhpv represents the human proteins that are known to interact with hpv proteins. for each hpv protein, the number of hhpv in a training set was computed by ni=n⋅nn , where ti is the i-th hpv protein.

RESULTS
performance evaluation
we evaluated the performance of the svm model in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

  sensitivity=tptp+fn 

  specificity=tntn+fp 

  accuracy=tp+tntp+fp+tn+fn 

true positives  are actual interacting proteins that are predicted correctly. true negatives  are non-interacting proteins that are predicted correctly. false positives  are non-interacting proteins that are predicted as interacting proteins. false negatives  are interacting proteins that are missed.

we did not perform cross validation to evaluate the svm model. instead, we prepared independent test sets that were not used in training the svm model. in general, cross-validation shows a much higher performance than testing a prediction model on a new data set that was not used in training. as shown later in this paper, some virus proteins have a very small number of human protein interaction partners to perform cross validation. for example, the hcv ns4a and hcv ns4b proteins have only  <dig> and  <dig> interaction partners, respectively. the hpv e <dig> protein has only  <dig> interaction partners, and the hpv e <dig> protein has only  <dig> interaction partners. thus, we tested the svm model on new, independent data sets that were not used in training the model.

interaction of hcv proteins
due to the randomness in drawing negative data from hprd and positive data from the data set of hcv-human protein interactions for the training set, we prepared three independent test sets and evaluated the svm model with the sets . for comparison, we also tested the method of shen et al.  <cit>  on these sets. table  <dig> compares our method with shen's method in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy with the hcv data.

comparison of our representation method with the method by shen et al.  <cit>  in terms of sensitivity , specificity  and accuracy  with the hcv data. the two representation methods are different in their classification of  <dig> amino acids and definition of the relative frequency of an amino acid triplet .

as shown in table  <dig>  our svm model, on average, achieved a sensitivity of  <dig> %, a specificity of  <dig> % and an accuracy of  <dig> %. it outperformed the method of shen et al.  <cit> , which on average, achieved a sensitivity of  <dig> %, a specificity of  <dig> % and an accuracy of  <dig> %. in particular, our method showed the best performance in the second test set.

to find new human proteins that potentially interact with hcv proteins , we ran blast http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ with the known hhcv as query sequences against the human proteins in genbank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/. the e-value was set to 10- <dig> when running blast. after removing redundant sequences with the  <dig> known hhcv proteins, we obtained a total of  <dig>  human proteins as the initial candidates of hhcv .

the 'initial candidates of hhcv by blast search' indicate the initial candidates of human proteins interacting with hcv proteins  found by blast search from genbank with the known hhcv as query sequences. the 'predicted candidates of hhcv by svm' were determined by the svm model from the initial candidates of hhcv. the 'refined candidates of hhcv with go' were obtained from the predicted candidates by selecting hhcv that have the same go cellular component terms as the known hhcv.

in the  <dig>  human proteins, the svm model predicted  <dig>  proteins as potential candidates of hhcv. the  <dig>  candidates of hhcv were refined further by selecting human proteins that have the same gene ontology  cellular component terms  <cit>  as the known hhcv for each hcv protein. after this refinement, we obtained a total of  <dig> candidates of hhcv. for instance, the hcv e <dig> protein has  <dig> known hhcv proteins, and the  <dig> hhcv proteins have a total of  <dig> go cellular component terms. the svm model predicted  <dig> hhcv proteins as interacting partners of the hcv e <dig> protein, and  <dig> out of the  <dig> candidates were left as reliable candidates of hhcv, since they have the same go cellular component terms as the known hhcv proteins. figure  <dig> shows an interaction network of the  <dig> hhcv proteins predicted by our method.

interaction of hpv proteins
to evaluate the performance of the model with the hpv datasets, we prepared three training sets and three test sets . we tested both our method and shen's method  <cit>  on the test sets. as shown in table  <dig>  our method achieved on average, a sensitivity of  <dig> %, a specificity of  <dig> % and an accuracy of  <dig> %. shen's method showed, on average, a sensitivity of  <dig> %, a specificity of  <dig> % and an accuracy of  <dig> %. in both hcv and hpv data sets, our method was better than shen's method. the major difference between our method and shen's method is in the representation of protein sequences. our classification of  <dig> amino and definition of the relative frequency of an amino acid triplet are different from those of shen's method .

comparison of our representation method with the method by shen et al.  <cit>  in terms of sensitivity , specificity  and accuracy  with the hpv data.

to find new human proteins that potentially interact with hpv proteins , we ran blastp http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ with the e-value ≤ 10- <dig> against the human proteins in genbank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/. after removing redundant sequences with the  <dig> known hhpv proteins, we obtained a total of  <dig> human proteins as the initial candidates of hhpv . in the  <dig> hhpv proteins, the svm model predicted  <dig> proteins as potential candidates of hhpv. in the  <dig> hhcv proteins, we selected the human proteins that have the same cellular component go ids as the known hhpv for each hpv protein. as a result, we found a total of  <dig> human proteins as potential hhpv. figure  <dig> shows an interaction network of  <dig> hhpv proteins that were predicted by our method.

the 'initial candidates of hhpv by blast search' indicate the initial candidates of human proteins interacting with hpv proteins  found by blast search from genbank with the known hhcv as query sequences. the 'predicted candidates of hhpv by svm' were determined by the svm model from the initial candidates of hhpv. the 'refined candidates of hhpv with go' were obtained from the predicted candidates by selecting hhcv that has the same go cellular component terms as the known hhpv.

comparative analysis of two viral interaction networks
in viral infections, different viruses target different human proteins, so they usually have interaction partners. we compared the interaction network of hcv with that of hpv to find common human protein targets. figure 3a shows the hcv interaction network overlaid by the hpv interaction network, both for the known interaction data. hcv and hpv have  <dig> human proteins as their common interaction partners: stat <dig> , cdkn1a , nr4a <dig> , jun , tp <dig> , tp <dig> , ipo <dig> , fadd , fhl <dig> , ep <dig> , and ahnak . in particular, four human proteins, cdkn1a , tp <dig> , tp <dig> , and fadd  proteins, shown in figure 3b, are the common interaction partners of the hcv core protein and hpv e <dig> protein. they are known to be engaged in the p <dig> signalling pathway for apoptosis http://www.sabiosciences.com/rt_pcr_product/html/pahs-027a.html.

in a similar way, we compared the predicted interaction network of hcv and that of hpv . hcv and hpv have  <dig> human proteins as their common interaction partners : slc1a <dig> , krt <dig> , tp <dig> , gsk3b , cdk <dig> , cdk11b , and nlk .

CONCLUSIONS
most methods for predicting protein-protein interactions focus on the interactions within a species rather than for the interactions across different species, such as interactions between virus and host cell proteins. in this paper we presented a support vector machine  model and its representation method for predicting the interactions between viruses and human proteins.

we represented a protein sequence using three consecutive amino acids called amino acid triplet. we mapped a protein sequence of variable length to a feature vector of fixed length, and then mapped the feature vector to a frequency vector that represents the relative frequency of each triplet within the protein sequence. the svm model showed an average accuracy of  <dig> % in predicting human proteins that interact with hcv proteins, and a similar accuracy  in predicting human proteins that interact with hpv proteins. the performance of our svm model was better than that of the other method  <cit>  in both data sets of hcv and hpv. using the svm model and gene ontology  annotations of proteins, we also predicted new human proteins that potentially interact with hcv or hpv proteins. from the comparative analysis of two viral interaction networks, we found common human proteins that are targeted by both viruses.

our experiment on  <dig> different types of viruses showed that encoding the relative frequency of amino acid triplets of a protein sequence is a simple yet powerful representation method for protein sequences when finding protein-protein interactions across different species. the representation method has several advantages. first, it enables a prediction model to achieve better performance than that of other representations. second, it generates feature vectors of fixed length regardless of the sequence length. third, the same representation is applicable to different types of proteins.

elucidating virus-host interactions is important for understanding viral infections and for identifying new targets for rational drug discovery. in the future, we plan to construct virus-host protein interaction networks to achieve more viral species and perform further comparative analysis of the interaction networks to discover interaction patterns central or specific to them.
