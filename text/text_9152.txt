BACKGROUND
since the cloning of the green fluorescent protein  cdna and its first heterologous expression in the early 1990s  <cit> , the use of intrinsically fluorescent proteins  has become one of the most powerful tools in molecular and cell biology. these proteins are applied as reporters in gene expression studies, as indicators of intra-cellular physiological changes, for monitoring dynamics of organelles and proteins, for investigation of protein-protein interactions in vivo and as fusion partners in studies of the subcellular localization of proteins  <cit> .

from the very beginning, many efforts have been made to optimize various features of the native gfp with the aim to improve its application in biological research. these modifications include for instance improved folding efficiency, higher expression level or increased solubility  <cit> . cyan and yellow fluorescent derivatives of gfp have been created for investigations requiring the simultaneous distinguishable tagging of more than one protein at a time  <cit> . these are used to compare the spatial distribution or the expression pattern of two or more proteins and for the analysis of protein-protein interactions by fret. so far no red fluorescent variant of gfp has been reported. recently, investigation of several non-bioluminescent anthozoan species has led to the isolation of various true red fluorescent proteins   <cit> . among these, dsred and its derivatives are the most commonly used in molecular and cell biological research  <cit> .

since plants contain a large number of multi-gene families, comparisons of the subcelluar localizations of the individual members are necessary as part of the comprehensive analysis of these proteins. the possibility to label several proteins with different fluorescent proteins is a great advantage when analyzing their respective subcellular localization. as a crucial prerequisite for such studies, the compartments to which the fusion proteins are targeted have to be unequivocally identified. this is often done by staining with compartment-specific dyes. mitochondria for instance can be visualized by staining with the red fluorescent dye mitotracker® red cm-h2xros  which specifically interacts with the respiratory chain. the staining procedure, however, is time-consuming, invasive and short-lived and can be replaced simply by co-expression of a spectrally different second fusion protein with a defined subcellular localization. additionally, the fused target sequence of the fluorescent marker protein can be readily exchanged, which allows selective labeling of nearly every subcellular structure under investigation without the need to have a specific dye for the different compartments.

despite the discovery of a multiplicity of fluorescent proteins in the red spectral range in recent years  <cit> , so far almost exclusively different forms of dsred have been used for studies in molecular cell biology in plants  <cit> . these proteins are applied in dual-labeling experiments together with gfp or alone to report on promoter activity or as a marker in transgenic plants. to introduce an alternative rfp for the application in plant cells and to expand the palette of red fluorescent reporters for plant research, we tested the suitability of the red fluorescent protein eqfp <dig> from the sea anemone entacmaea quadricolor as a marker in subcellular localization experiments in plants.

eqfp <dig> shows far-red fluorescence with excitation and emission maxima at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively, and therefore exhibits an extraordinarily large stokes shift of  <dig> nm  <cit> . in contrast, the respective values for dsred are  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively  <cit> . both eqfp <dig> and dsred have comparable molecular masses of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda, respectively, for the monomers. the extinction coefficient of eqfp <dig>  is slightly higher than that of dsred . fluorescence quantum yields for eqfp <dig> and dsred are  <dig>  and  <dig>  and the photobleaching quantum yields are  <dig>  * 10- <dig> and  <dig> – <dig>  * 10- <dig>  respectively. similar to dsred, the emission of eqfp <dig> is constant between ph  <dig> and  <dig>  though both form tetramers at physiological concentrations, eqfp <dig> has a reduced tendency to oligomerize and aggregate as compared to dsred. with a maturation half-time t <dig>  of  <dig>  h at  <dig> °c  <cit> , fluorophore maturation of eqfp <dig> is much faster than that of dsred   <cit> .

we demonstrate that native eqfp <dig> can be expressed in plant cells. fusions of this protein with respective n-terminal signal sequences can be efficiently targeted to mitochondria and peroxisomes. we performed co-expression experiments with eqfp <dig> and gfp and created vectors for the straightforward application of the eqfp <dig> gene in plants.

RESULTS
eqfp <dig> can be functionally expressed in plant cells
recently, eqfp <dig>  the gene for a red fluorescent protein from the sea anemone entacmaea quadricolor, has been cloned and characterized  <cit> . this protein has been succesfully expressed in bacteria and animal cells  <cit> , but has not yet been tested in plants.

to test its use as a marker in plants, the native eqfp <dig> cdna was cloned into a puc19-based vector. in the resulting plasmid peqfp <dig>  expression of this gene is governed by the strong constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter  and the nopaline synthase terminator  sequences. upon inspection of nicotiana tabacum mesophyll cells transfected with this plasmid in the epifluorescence microscope, the red fluorescence was clearly detectable with a filter set  usually used for visualization of mitotracker red and here later referred to as mitotracker filter set . the protein accumulates in the nucleus and in the cytosol, where it is evenly distributed and does not form any visible aggregates, but is clearly absent from the chloroplasts. no such fluorescence was detectable in untransfected control cells, confirming that the red fluorescence indeed originates from the expression of the introduced eqfp <dig>  protoplasts were analysed  <dig> hours after transfection. incubation for an additional  <dig> hours did not markedly increase the intensity of the red fluorescence, suggesting the maximal level of mature protein to be essentially reached within  <dig> hours after transfection. protoplasts expressing eqfp <dig> looked perfectly normal and did not show any detrimental effects of this fluorescent protein.

these results show that eqfp <dig> can be readily used in plants, since the functional protein accumulates to detectable levels without any obvious adverse effects. in contrast to gfp, whose original jellyfish-derived cdna was misspliced specifically in plants at a cryptic splice site  <cit> , no modification of the eqfp <dig> coding sequence is necessary for efficient expression in plants.

as expected from its spectral characteristics, the fluorescence is easily detectable with a filter set  that excludes the red autofluorescence of chlorophyll, a crucial advantage for an rfp applied in mesophyll cells. similar to gfp  <cit> , the native eqfp <dig> accumulates in the nucleus and in the cytosol in plant cells. thus, it should be suited to investigate protein targeting into e.g. mitochondria, peroxisomes and plastids within plants. in hela cells, native, unmodified eqfp <dig> was also found in the nucleus and the cytosol  <cit> .

targeting eqfp <dig> to mitochondria
to investigate whether eqfp <dig> can indeed be used as reporter protein for the analysis of subcellular protein sorting, import into plant mitochondria was exemplarily tested. to this end, the presequence of the mitochondrial isovaleryl-coa-dehydrogenase  was added to the n-terminus of eqfp <dig> . the ivd presequence was chosen because it has previously been found to efficiently target a gfp fusion protein exclusively to mitochondria  <cit> . in addition, the protein has been repeatedly detected in proteomic analyses of this organelle, demonstrating its unambiguous localization in mitochondria  <cit> . inspection of the protoplasts transfected with pivd145-eqfp <dig> using the mitotracker filter set revealed the red fluorescence to be restricted exclusively to rod-shaped structures of  <dig> –  <dig> μm in length distributed throughout the cell . this pattern is characteristic for a mitochondrial localization of the fusion protein. no red fluorescence was detectable in other parts of the protoplasts. thus, eqfp <dig> can be efficiently targeted to plant mitochondria, its subcellular localization being exclusively determined by the targeting information of the signal peptide fused to its n-terminus. furthermore, this result confirms that eqfp <dig> is efficiently transported through two membranes while retaining its ability to fold properly for effective fluorescence. similar to the native eqfp <dig>  prolonged incubation of the protoplasts did not increase the intensity of the fluorescence.

the picture of the transfected protoplast displayed in fig. 2a demonstrates nicely that the use of the mitotracker filter set is appropriate to easily detect the red fluorescence of eqfp <dig> while effectively blocking chlorophyll autofluorescence. the latter is clearly visible through the fitc  filter set , which in turn blocks the fluorescence of eqfp <dig> . this autofluorescence in the chloroplasts exactly fits to the areas without fluorescence in fig. 2a. furthermore, the untransfected cells surrounding the eqfp611-expressing protoplast in fig. 2a clearly show that no other autogenous fluorescence is visible through the mitotracker filter set.

to assess the relative stability of the eqfp <dig> fluorescence in plants, we qualitatively compared the time elapsed until bleaching of the red fluorescence in protoplasts transiently expressing ivd145-eqfp <dig> and of mitotracker® red cm-h2xros  used for staining of untransfected protoplasts. this latter mitochondria-specific fluorescent dye has excitation/emission maxima of  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively. when individual cells of both approaches were inspected under identical light conditions in the fluorescence microscope, the fluorescence of ivd145-eqfp <dig> was at least as stable as the fluorescence of mitotracker, which further demonstrates the usability of eqfp <dig> as marker at least in plant mitochondria.

co-expression of eqfp <dig> and smgfp <dig> in tobacco protoplasts
experiments like subcellular localization studies in which one of the fluorescent proteins is used to mark a distinct cellular compartment, require the simultaneous expression of two different fluorescent proteins. if eqfp <dig> is to be used routinely in such applications, its expression must be fully compatible with other ifps, e.g. gfp. to test whether co-expression of both fluorescent proteins is indeed useful, tobacco protoplasts were simultaneously transfected with the constructs pivd145-eqfp <dig> and pivd145-smgfp <dig>  both plasmids contain identical mitochondrial targeting sequences fused to the n-termini of eqfp <dig> or smgfp <dig>  respectively. most of the succesfully transfected protoplasts incorporated both plasmids and expressed both eqfp <dig> and smgfp <dig>  identical patterns of the red and the green fluorescence in these protoplasts confirmed the co-expression of both proteins in the same cell . in addition to the gfp-derived green fluorescence in the mitochondria, the red chlorophyll autofluorescence in the chloroplasts is seen with the fitc filter set .

to examine whether the transport into mitochondria of both fusion proteins occurs independently of each other and to exclude a possible chance "piggy back" effect during subcelluar transport of the two chimeric proteins, tobacco protoplasts were transfected with a different combination of plasmids. this time, pivd145-smgfp <dig> was used for co-transfection with plasmid pkat2-eqfp <dig>  which latter encodes a recombinant protein of the peroxisomal targeting signal  <dig>   <cit>  of 3-keto-acyl-coa thiolase  <dig>   <cit>  n-terminally fused to the eqfp <dig> reading frame. red and green fluorescences were again found exclusively in the expected organelles . the green fluorescence is observed in mitochondria, while the red fluorescence is visible in approximately  <dig> –  <dig> μm large roundish structures, a shape expected for leaf peroxisomes. no green fluorescence is seen in these organelles and conversely no red fluorescence is detected in mitochondria. this strongly suggests that if there is any interference, it does not disturb the correct targeting of the individual fusion proteins. thus, eqfp <dig> and smgfp <dig> can be used in parallel to study protein sorting to different organelles within the same plant cell.

to verify that the kat2-eqfp <dig> fusion protein was indeed targeted to peroxisomes, pkat2-eqfp <dig> was used for co-transfection together with p35s-n-tap2pex. the latter plasmid encodes a gfp fusion protein targeted to peroxisomal membranes by the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of cotton ascorbate peroxidase . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the patterns of the green and the red fluorescence overlap, indicating the correct peroxisomal localization of kat2-eqfp <dig>  green fluorescence seems to be more intensive at the boundaries of the peroxisomes, while the red fluorescence is equally distributed within the organelles. this is consistent with the predicted intra-peroxisomal localization of the apx and kat <dig> proteins, respectively. no green or red fluorescence is visible outside the peroxisomes. these experiments demonstrate that the n-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal  <dig> efficiently directs eqfp <dig> to the corresponding organelle and that this rfp can thus be exployed to study protein sorting into peroxisomes in plants.

thus, as demonstrated by the expression in both mitochondria and peroxisomes, eqfp <dig> is a suitable partner for gfp in double-labeling experiments. when the two ifps are co-expressed in the same cell, no mutual interference regarding development of fluorescence or intracellular sorting is observed. additionally, both eqfp <dig> and gfp fluorescences can be easily distinguished by their emission spectra. the previously reported minor green fluorescence of eqfp <dig> was undetectable under the conditions used   <cit> .

furthermore, despite the tendency of eqfp <dig> to form tetramers  <cit> , its fusion proteins can be efficiently and reliably targeted to organelles. the transport across single  or double  membranes does not interfere with the formation of the higher order structure necessary for emitting fluorescence. in addition, the fusion of a signal sequence to its n-terminus has no negative influence on the red fluorescence of eqfp <dig> 

expression of both eqfp <dig> and smgfp <dig> from a single plasmid
transformation of nicotiana benthamiana leaves by injection of agrobacterium tumefaciens  <cit>  containing ifp fusion genes is another fast and simple method for the analysis of the subcellular localization of a protein. this procedure is presumably closer to the in vivo conditions than protoplast transfection, since the transformed cells remain in the original tissue context. in addition, this approach does not require the relatively laborious preparation of protoplasts. in this case, expression of the two fusion proteins from the same plasmid is advantageous, since a single transformation event is sufficient to ensure that every transformed cell contains both ifp genes. apart from that, expressing both fluorescent proteins from the same plasmid under identical promoters should generate equal amounts of rfp and gfp within a cell. the entire procedure should be easier since only a single construct has to be handled. to investigate the feasibilty of this procedure, plasmid pivd144-eqfp611-ivd145-smgfp <dig> containing both the eqfp <dig> and the smgfp <dig> genes with mitochondrial presequences each under control of a camv 35s promoter was constructed and first tested by transfection of tobacco protoplasts. again, both red and green fluorescence could easily be detected in the same cell . the fluorescence is found exclusively in mitochondria, the patterns of both red and green fluorescence being identical. this result is indistinguishable from the experiment with the same eqfp <dig> and smgfp <dig> expression cassettes encoded on two different plasmids , but this time every transfected protoplast expressed both eqfp <dig> and smgfp <dig> 

for co-expression of eqfp <dig> and smgfp <dig> in n. benthamiana, a binary vector suitable for plant transformation by agrobacteria was generated. the rfp-gfp-expression cassette from pivd144-eqfp611-ivd145-smgfp <dig> was transferred into pbi <dig>  creating pivd144-eqfp611-ivd145-smgfp4-pbi <dig>  a. tumefaciens containing the latter plasmid was then injected into n. benthamiana leaves. after transformation, both red and green fluorescence were visible in mitochondria of epidermal cell layers , demonstrating the convenient use of the corresponding vector in this system.

tobacco plants stably expressing mitochondrially targeted eqfp611
a third way to use eqfp <dig> as a mitochondrial marker in plant cells is the generation of transgenic plants constitutively expressing mitochondrially targeted eqfp <dig>  to create such plants, the rfp-expression cassette of pivd145-eqfp <dig> was cloned into pbi <dig>  the resulting plasmid pivd145-eqfp611-pbi <dig> was stably transformed into tobacco by leaf disc transformation. several independent plant lines were regenerated from transgenic calli and screened for bright red fluorescence in mitochondria. red fluorescent mitochondria were observed in all t <dig> transformants, but expression levels varied between individual plants. in addition, segregation was observed in the next generation. thus, only the offspring of the most strongly fluorescent t <dig> plant was used for propagation . the transgenic plants completed their life cycle like wild-type plants and the red fluorescence in mitochondria was stably transmitted up to the t <dig> generation, the last generation analyzed. no phenotypic differences were observed between the transgenic and wild-type plants. thus, eqfp <dig> obviously causes no cytotoxic or other detrimental effects even upon constitutive expression over several generations.

CONCLUSIONS
our results consistently demonstrate that eqfp <dig> meets all requirements for a potential fluorescent reporter protein for application in plants. it can be expressed in plant cells from the unmodified e. quadricolor cdna sequence to levels easily detectable by epifluorescence microscopy without any adverse affect on viability. eqfp <dig> fluorescence can readily be separated from the red chlorophyll autofluorescence by using appropriate filter sets. its subcellular localization can be efficiently controlled by n-terminal signal sequences. eqfp <dig> and gfp are fully compatible in dual-labeling experiments since there is no cross-interference with regard to expression and intra-cellular sorting and their fluorescence spectra can be clearly distinguished.

in addition, the plasmids created in the course of this work are convenient tools for the investigation of the subcellular localization of proteins in plant cells. the constructs encoding ifp fusions proteins with mitochondrial and peroxisomal targeting sequences can be used to express markers for the visualization of the corresponding organelles. the targeting sequences can also be easily exchanged to create new ifp fusions with any protein. furthermore, all ifp expression cassettes can be transferred by hindiii/ecori digestion into the plant transformation vector pbi <dig> and derivatives thereof. finally, the tobacco line stably expressing eqfp <dig> targeted to mitochondria is a useful source for protoplasts with an endogenous mitochondrial marker.

in summary, eqfp <dig> represents a true alternative to other rfps and can be added into the tool box of red fluorescent proteins for use in plants.
