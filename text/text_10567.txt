BACKGROUND
located in pericentric, telomeric, and some internal chromosomal regions, heterochromatin plays an important role in cell division  <cit> , meiotic pairing  <cit> , regulation of dna replication, and gene expression  <cit> . among insect species, the most detailed analysis of heterochromatin has been performed in drosophila  <cit> . molecular analysis has determined that pericentric heterochromatic regions are enriched with highly and moderately repetitive dna sequences, and are extremely depleted of genes  <cit> . mapping of heterochromatic scaffolds is difficult because the heterochromatin is underreplicated and poorly banded in polytene chromosomes of salivary glands. special efforts had to be directed towards the assembly and annotation of heterochromatin in drosophila  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis of the heterochromatic portion of the drosophila genome revealed the presence of more than  <dig> genes. interestingly, heterochromatic genes are enriched specific functional domains, including putative membrane cation transporters domains and domains involved in dna or protein binding  <cit> . this finding suggests that pericentric heterochromatin may encode genes involved in the establishment or maintenance of alternative chromatin states. in addition to the pericentric heterochromatin, drosophila has intercalary heterochromatin, which is interspersed throughout the euchromatin and characterized, in part, by underreplication in polytene chromosomes of larval salivary glands  <cit> . a study of a genome-wide profile of underreplication in polytene chromosomes identified  <dig> underreplication zones, which were colocalized with regions of intercalary heterochromatin. these underreplication zones varied from  <dig> to  <dig> kb in length, and each contained from  <dig> to  <dig> unique genes  <cit> .

one of the important problems of chromosome biology is to understand the relationships between the morphology of the chromatin and the dna and protein composition. two morphological types of the heterochromatin have been described in the pericentromeric regions of drosophila polytene chromosomes: proximal condensed, α-, and distal diffuse, β-heterochromatin  <cit> . the compact central part of the chromocenter  is enriched with satellite dna, while the distal diffuse area  contains mostly transposable elements   <cit> . biochemical studies have discovered that heterochromatic regions have a specific histone code, characterized by hypoacetylation and methylation of the histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig>  <cit> . this modification of the histone h <dig> is a docking site for the heterochromatin protein  <dig>   <cit> , a major component of heterochromatin first described in drosophila  <cit> . comparative studies of drosophila polytene chromosomes have discovered differences in the chromatin state suggesting the switching of chromatin states during evolution. for instance, when staining patterns of hp <dig> on polytene chromosomes were compared, it was found that the heterochromatic fourth chromosomes of d. melanogaster and d. pseudoobscura bind to hp <dig>  while the euchromatic fourth chromosome of d. virilis does not. interestingly, the level of ca/gt repeats on chromosome  <dig> of d. virilis is  <dig> fold higher than the level on chromosome  <dig> of d. melanogaster. moreover, the density of tes in this chromosome is significantly higher for d. melanogaster than for d. virilis  <cit> .

a number of studies have demonstrated direct associations between heterochromatin and the nuclear envelope   <cit> . in drosophila salivary gland nuclei, pericentromeric heterochromatin attaches permanently to the ne, while intercalary heterochromatin forms high-frequency contacts to ne  <cit> . chromatin fibers of diffuse heterochromatin form visible attachments to the ne in drosophila  <cit>  and anopheles  <cit> . the chromosomal regions that attach to the ne may depend on the presence of specific dna. for example, repetitive matrix attachment regions  specifically bind to lamin, the major protein of the nuclear periphery  <cit> . it has been shown that mar dna is several fold richer in heterochromatin than in euchromatin  <cit> .

although the drosophila studies provided important insights into the structural and functional organization of heterochromatin, the organization of heterochromatin in other insects remains poorly understood. malaria mosquitoes are an excellent system for studying heterochromatin because they possess well-developed polytene chromosomes with clear morphology. sequencing of the genome of the major african malaria vector an. gambiae  <cit>  provides an opportunity to analyze the molecular structure of the heterochromatin and to study genomic determinants of heterochromatin formation, maintenance, and function. in malaria mosquitoes, the heterochromatin size and morphology vary significantly among species and within species  <cit> , affecting mating behavior and fertility  <cit> . in the an. gambiae complex, one of the species, an. gambiae sensu stricto, is subdivided into two subtaxa: the m and s molecular forms  <cit> . these two partially isolated subtaxa predominantly breed within their own form and differ in behavior and environmental adaptations  <cit> . a dna microarray analysis revealed that two pericentric regions on x and 2l were the major islands of fixed genomic differentiation between the m and s molecular forms  <cit> . a more recent microarray study based on the improved agamp <dig> assembly and agamp <dig>  gene build provided better estimates for the number and size of diverged pericentric islands between the m and s forms  <cit> . the study found three islands of genomic divergence: a ~4-mb region on the x chromosome, a ~ <dig> -mb region on the 2l arm, and a  <dig> -mb region on the 3l arm. however, it is not clear if the pericentric islands of genomic divergence are located within heterochromatin or mostly overlap with euchromatin of an. gambiae.

according to the cot analysis, about  <dig> mb  of the an. gambiae genome corresponds to repetitive elements, which are mostly located in heterochromatic areas of the chromosomes  <cit> . however, only  <dig>  mb were identified as heterochromatin in the first publication of an. gambiae genome  <cit> . using cdna clones for the physical mapping of the heterochromatic scaffolds, an additional  <dig>  mb were mapped to the pericentromeric regions in the chromosomes  <cit> . nevertheless, the more precise chromosomal and genomic mapping, as well as detailed analysis of the molecular organization of the anopheles heterochromatin, has yet to be conducted.

in this study, the boundaries of the heterochromatin-euchromatin junctions of all morphologically defined pericentric and intercalary heterochromatin regions were determined for each of the five chromosomal arms of an. gambiae. the large regions of intercalary heterochromatin were morphologically different:  <dig> -mb and  <dig> -mb regions of 2l and 3l were diffuse, while a  <dig> -mb region of 3r was a compact heterochromatin. because the an. gambiae genome assembly successfully captured not only the euchromatin, but a significant portion of the heterochromatin, comparative analysis of chromatin types was possible. we provided evidence that heterochromatin and euchromatin differ in gene density and the coverage of retroelements and segmental duplications . gene ontology  analysis revealed that heterochromatin is enriched in genes with dna-binding and regulatory activities. the pericentric heterochromatin had the highest coverage of retroelements and tandem repeats, while intercalary heterochromatin was enriched with sds. we also demonstrated that the diffuse intercalary heterochromatin binds to hp <dig> and lamin and has a higher coverage of dna tes, minisatellites, and satellites than does the compact intercalary heterochromatin. the investigation of 42-mb assembly of unmapped genomic scaffolds  demonstrated that it has molecular characteristics similar to cytologically mapped heterochromatin. finally, the locations and sizes of pericentric heterochromatin regions closely matched the locations and sizes of pericentric islands of genomic divergence between m and s incipient species of an. gambiae.

RESULTS
morphological types of the an. gambiae heterochromatin
the diploid number of the chromosomes in malaria mosquitoes is six, which includes two pairs of autosomes as well as the x and y sex chromosomes. the polytene chromosome complement of a female mosquito has five chromosomal arms: four autosomal arms 2r, 2l, 3r, 3l, and one arm of the x chromosome. in this study, morphological identification of the heterochromatin for the african malaria mosquito an. gambiae was performed for the first time. the following criteria were used to distinguish heterochromatic and euchromatic regions in the polytene chromosomes from ovarian nurse cells . we considered a region as heterochromatic if it  consisted of a compact condensed block or  had a diffuse granulated structure with no banding pattern. these two types of heterochromatin can be distinguished from euchromatic regions, which have a clear banding pattern or puffy nongranulated areas. pericentric regions of all chromosomes matched these morphological criteria of heterochromatin. the pericentric heterochromatin of the x chromosome has a large diffuse granulated area in region  <dig>  which is similar to the β-heterochromatin of drosophila . the diffuse granulated heterochromatin  is morphologically distinct from the euchromatic nongranulated puff in subdivision 9c of the 2r arm . in addition, region  <dig> of the x chromosome has a dark compact band in the tip of the chromosome , which was previously described as a nucleolar organizer region because ribosomal genes were mapped to this area by in situ hybridization  <cit> . the polytene chromosome  <dig> has a dark compact proximal heterochromatin surrounded by abundant diffuse heterochromatin in regions 19e-20a . a dark heterochromatic band is also present in region 19d of the 2r arm. the pericentric heterochromatin of chromosome  <dig> spans subdivisions 37d-38a. chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> form a diffuse chromocenter via their pericentric heterochromatin  <cit> .

three regions of intercalary heterochromatin are visible on arms 2l, 3r, and 3l . the subdivision 21a of 2l chromosomal arm forms a large, lightly granulated puff-like structure with no banding pattern. the middle area of subdivision 38c of 3l arm has a similar morphology, but it is slightly smaller and darker. both regions of intercalary diffuse heterochromatin are located in close proximity to the pericentric regions. the third region of intercalary heterochromatin is in subdivision 35b of the 3r arm and is located  <dig> subdivisions away from the centromere. unlike intercalary heterochromatin of 2l and 3l, this region has a compact dense structure, which is similar to α-heterochromatin of drosophila. in malaria mosquitoes, diffuse and compact types of heterochromatin were previously described in the anopheles maculipennis subgroup  <cit> . interestingly, the large blocks of compact heterochromatin or the diffuse intercalary heterochromatin regions have not been seen in most species of drosophila. the intercalary heterochromatin in salivary gland nuclei of d. melanogaster is strongly underreplicated and has the morphology of ''weak'' points, which are able to form ectopic contacts  <cit> . these properties are less prominent in ovarian nurse cell nuclei of the d. melanogaster otu <dig> strain where the bands of intercalary heterochromatin are morphologically similar to euchromatic bands  <cit> . large blocks of intercalary heterochromatin have been described in polytene chromosomes of d. immertensis and species from genera chironomus and anopheles  <cit> . although the morphology of pericentric heterochromatin is similar in an. gambiae and d. melanogaster, the presence of two distinct types of intercalary heterchromatin in an. gambiae makes this species a unique model system for studying genomic determinants of chromatin morphology.

chromosomal localization of hp <dig> and lamin in an. gambiae
hp <dig> is an evolutionarily conserved protein and a good marker of heterochromatic regions  <cit> . one hp1a ortholog is present in an. gambiae . the an. gambiae protein agap009444-pa is  <dig> % similar to the d. melanogaster hp1a protein in the  <dig> overlapping amino acids. the antibodies for hp <dig> were localized in the chromocenter, chromosome  <dig>  telomeric, and some euchromatic regions in d. melanogaster  <cit> . in order to examine the association of hp <dig> with heterochromatin in an. gambiae, we hybridized the primary antibody c1a <dig> against d. melanogaster hp <dig> to an. gambiae polytene chromosomes. this antibody correctly recognized hp <dig> even in more distantly related species such as the mealybug planococcus citri  <cit> . several positively stained loci were invariable, i.e., they were found on every examined chromosome and on every slide. similar to drosophila, the major invariable sites of hp <dig> localization were the pericentric regions in an. gambiae . in addition, diffuse intercalary heterochromatin of regions 21a and 38c were always stained positively for hp <dig>  only one major invariable hp1-binding site was identified in a large interband of the euchromatic region 9c of 2r arm . all other positive euchromatic sites were variable, and a total of  <dig> hp <dig> binding sites were detected on an. gambiae chromosomes . based on the previous an. gambiae genome mapping coordinates, we analyzed the molecular content of the euchromatic site of hp1/lamin binding in region 9c . the analysis found no enrichment of any class of te. the only heterochromatic molecular feature of this region was a  <dig> -kb block of satellite dna, which consisted of 228-bp units repeated  <dig> times. similarly, one major invariable site of hp <dig> binding was found in euchromatic region  <dig> of the 2l arm in d. melanogaster  <cit> . however, the molecular analysis of this region found no enrichment in any repetitive dna. about 200- <dig> actively expressing loci related to developmentally important and heat-shock genes were positively stained for hp <dig> in drosophila chromosomes, suggesting a positive role for hp <dig> in euchromatic gene expression  <cit> . however, only  <dig> hp1-positive euchromatic sites were invariable among strains, natural populations, and individuals of d. melanogaster  <cit> . unlike in drosophila, telomeric localization of hp <dig> was found only on chromosome x in an. gambiae, but even this site was variable. surprisingly, no hp <dig> binding was detected in the compact intercalary heterochromatin of subdivision 35b of the 3r chromosome, suggesting that this region has a distinct molecular composition or is strongly underreplicated, and thus, hp <dig> presence is below the level of detection. subdivision 35b was morphologically described as heterochromatic based on very dense dark structure . the genomic analysis confirmed its repeat-rich gene-poor heterochromatic nature .

association of heterochromatin with the ne has been demonstrated in a number of studies  <cit> . attachment of pericentric regions to the ne in ovarian nurse cell nuclei of an. gambiae has also been demonstrated  <cit> . in our study, the attachments to the nuclear periphery were detected in all pericentric regions, and diffuse intercalary heterochromatin in regions 21a  and 38c  . to test whether heterochromatin binds to the ne, mosquito chromosomes were stained with antibody adl <dig>  against ne protein lamin dm <dig> of d. melanogaster. we found only one lamin dm <dig> ortholog in the an. gambiae genome . the an. gambiae protein agap011938-pa is  <dig> % similar to the d. melanogaster lamin dm <dig> protein in the  <dig> overlapping amino acids. the antibody against lamin dm <dig> successfully hybridized to the an. gambiae chromosomes and colocalized with the hp <dig> antibody in all major invariable sites and in most of the variable sites . however, the total number of sites was higher for lamin dm <dig>  than for hp <dig>  . the major sites for lamin dm <dig> were found in the pericentromeric areas, diffuse intercalary heterochromatin regions, and euchromatic interband in region 9c. no lamin dm <dig> antibody was detected in region 35b of the 3r chromosome of an. gambiae.

thus, the immunostaining of the antibodies for hp <dig> and lamin dm <dig> has demonstrated that both proteins are primarily associated with the diffuse pericentric and intercalary heterochromatin, but not with the compact intercalary heterochromatin of an. gambiae. two binding motifs, chromo and chromoshadow domains, provide hp <dig> with the ability to be broadly involved in chromatin and protein binding  <cit> . in vitro studies revealed a direct interaction between hp <dig> and the lamin b receptor in mammalian cells  <cit> . however, in drosophila, similar direct associations of hp <dig> with lamin have not been shown, and these proteins have been found associated with different genomic regions  <cit> . therefore, despite the colocalization of hp <dig> and lamin in heterochromatin of an. gambiae, the actual protein binding sites in the genome may differ as suggested by the additional regions of lamin binding.

heterochromatin-euchromatin boundaries in the an. gambiae genome
the cytological identification of heterochromatin allowed us to determine the location of heterochromatin-euchromatin boundaries in the an. gambiae genome. the approximate coordinates were found based on the genome positions of bac and cdna clones, which were physically mapped to chromosomes near heterochromatin-euchromatin boundaries  <cit> . because heterochromatic regions were not sufficiently covered with markers, additional pcr-amplified gene fragments were designed and utilized as dna probes for physical mapping. fluorescent in situ hybridization  was used to hybridize multiple pcr products thought to be located near the heterochromatin-euchromatin boundary of each major heterochromatic region of the five chromosome arms . this allowed for more exacting definition of the boundaries, based on the outermost heterochromatin and euchromatin markers, defining a transition zone with an average size of  <dig> kb . based on these boundaries, a total of ~ <dig>  mb was defined as a heterochromatin in the currently mapped genome assembly of an. gambiae . the mapped portion of the heterochromatin within defined chromosomes now comprises ~ <dig> % of the ~260-mb genome  <cit>  and contains  <dig>  of the ~ <dig>  total predicted genes. for comparison, no less than  <dig> genes were annotated in  <dig> mb of d. melanogaster heterochromatin   <cit> . in addition, the sizes of intercalary heterochromatin were also determined. the diffuse heterochromatic regions were  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb in 2l and 3l, respectively, and the compact heterochromatin on 3r was  <dig>  mb long. the relatively short sizes of regions of intercalary diffuse heterochromatin as compared to regions of condensed heterochromatin suggest incomplete genome assembly of the diffuse type. however, these sizes exceed the sizes of intercalary heterochromatin known in drosophila, which range from  <dig> to  <dig> kb  <cit> . the higher repeat content of the mosquito genome may be responsible for the larger sizes of intercalary heterochromatin in an. gambiae.

heterochromatin and pericentric regions of genomic divergence in incipient species
three pericentric islands of genomic divergence were found in chromosomes x, 2l, and 3l in two partially isolated subtaxa - the m and s molecular forms of an. gambiae s.s.  <cit> . our analysis showed that the positions of islands of genomic divergence mostly correspond to the positions of physically mapped regions of pericentric heterochromatin . the sizes of the pericentric heterochromatin were the following:  <dig>  mb of the x chromosome,  <dig>  mb of the 2l arm, and  <dig>  mb of the 3l arm. thus, the overlaps with islands of genomic divergence are 91% in the x chromosome, 97% in the 2l arm, and 94% in the 3l arm. this observation suggests that heterochromatic sequences diverge rapidly during speciation of malaria mosquitoes. earlier cytological studies showed the presence of significant intra- and interspecific differences in amount and location of heterochromatin in the an. gambiae complex  <cit> . a genome-wide microsatellite study of members of the an. gambiae complex has determined a high level of genetic introgression among species  <cit> . however, the an. gambiae microsatellites at six loci of x, 3l, and 3r could not be amplified in all sibling species, indicating significant sequence divergence from the major malaria vector. these loci were identified as heterochromatic in our study. fast changes in heterochromatic dna can be accompanied by the rapid evolution of heterochromatic proteins. although hp <dig> is an evolutionarily conserved protein, other heterochromatin- and centromere-associated proteins demonstrate rapid adaptive evolution  <cit> . for example, an lhr protein encoded by lhr  colocalizes with hp <dig> in heterochromatic regions and has diverged extensively in sequence between d. melanogaster and d. simulans species in a manner consistent with positive selection. interestingly, f <dig> hybrids between these species demonstrate altered chromatin structure, probably attributable to the effects of species-specific differences in tes and other repetitive dnas  <cit> , suggesting a role for heterochromatin in speciation.

overrepresentation of gene ontology terms in the an. gambiae heterochromatin
to characterize gene content of the an. gambiae heterochromatin, we utilized go terms  <cit> . the frequencies of go terms assigned to genes in heterochromatin were compared to frequencies for all go-annotated genes in the peptide dataset of an. gambiae . after bonferroni correction for multiple tests, this analysis revealed significant enrichment for molecular functions in heterochromatin, including dna binding  and sequence-specific dna binding . protein products of  <dig> heterochromatic genes constitute membrane, representing a significant enrichment of the go cellular location. finally, heterochromatin had overrepresentation of several gene types, including those encoding for proteins involved in biological regulation  and regulation of metabolic processes  . the go analysis of the "unknown chromosome"  identified enrichment in a number of interesting genes . we found that genes residing in the "unknown chromosome" had significant overrepresentation of go terms in biological processes, including chromosome organization , dna packaging , and nucleosome assembly . transcription initiation factor activity  was among several molecular functions overrepresented in the genes within the "unknown chromosome." analysis of the heterochromatic portion of the drosophila genome revealed the overrepresentation of similar go terms  <cit> . these studies suggest that heterochromatin of insects may accumulate genes important for its own establishing, maintaining, or modifying chromatin structure.

difference in molecular content among chromatin types of an. gambiae
using bayesian statistical model and procedure for discerning differences between chromatin types, eight molecular features were analyzed: genes, dna-mediated tes , rna-mediated tes , sds, micro- and minisatellites, satellites, and mars. these molecular features were compared among five distinct chromatin types: 1) pericentric heterochromatin of all chromosomes; 2) diffuse intercalary heterochromatin in regions 21a of 2l and 38c of 3l; 3) compact intercalary heterochromatin, region 35b of 3r; 4) proximal euchromatin, located between pericentric and diffuse intercalary heterochromatin, includes subdivisions 20cd of 2l and 38b of 3l; and 5) euchromatin in all remaining regions in the chromosomes. for this analysis, the data that distinguishes both the counts and the overall base-pair coverage were incorporated for each molecular feature into the genomic windows of each of the five chromatin types. dominant model selection procedures gave us the ability to compare all possible competing models and to select between parsimonious models by maximizing the posterior distribution.

heterochromatin had a uniformly low concentration of genes. on average, the gene density was  <dig>  times lower in the heterochromatin than in the euchromatin . our analysis showed that heterochromatin significantly exceeds euchromatin in the coverage of rna tes and sds. rna tes were the most abundant features in the mosquito genome . the pericentric heterochromatin had the highest coverage of rna tes, microsatellites, minisatellites, and satellites. the intercalary heterochromatin had a higher coverage of sds than all other chromatin types. the diffuse intercalary heterochromatin had a higher coverage of tes, minisatellites, and satellites than did the compact intercalary heterochromatin. the enrichment of tes in the pericentric heterochromatin and diffuse intercalary heterochromatin as compared to the compact intercalary heterochromatin can explain the pattern of hp <dig> localization in polytene chromosomes of an. gambiae. pericentric and diffuse intercalary heterochromatin, but not the compact type, was hp <dig> positive. similarly, the fourth chromosomes of d. melanogaster and d. pseudoobscura bound to hp <dig>  while the fourth chromosome of d. virilis did not. the density of tes in this chromosome was significantly higher for d. melanogaster than for d. virilis  <cit> . the proximal euchromatin had a higher coverage of dna tes, mars, and sds but a lower coverage of satellites than the rest of the euchromatin. these differences can probably be explained by the close distance of the proximal euchromatin to the centromere.

chromatin types and genome landscape in an. gambiae
in addition to the overall differences among chromatin types, the distribution of molecular features within chromosomal arms was analyzed. a high density of genes was seen outside of the heterochromatin boundaries believed to be euchromatin, followed by a transition zone and a heterochromatic region with a low gene density. the distribution of tes densities had the opposite pattern. the highest coverage of sds was detected in intercalary heterochromatin with peaks in some euchromatic regions of the 2r, 3r, and 3l arms . mars were found concentrated in the pericentric heterochromatic and proximal euchromatic regions of all arms, but they were also abundant in distal euchromatic regions of the 2l, 3r, and 3l arms. we observed the high coverage of predicted mars in heterochromatic regions, which are associated with the ne  <cit> . moreover, the increase in mar coverage seen in euchromatic regions of the 2l, 3r, and 3l arms correlated positively with the higher density of lamin-positive sites in these arms detected by immunostaining . the highest coverage of mars was found in proximal euchromatin, which was not stained by the lamin antibody. also, the two types of heterochromatin were not significantly different in mar coverage. however, the lamin-positive pericentric and diffuse intercalary heterochromatic regions were significantly enriched with tes. the coverage of dna tes was about two times higher in pericentric and diffuse intercalary heterochromatin than in other chromatin types .

overall, this analysis confirmed morphological predictions of heterochromatin. all types of heterochromatin in the an. gambiae genome had typical heterochromatic molecular features: low gene density and high coverage of tes and sds. however, because tes are significantly underannotated in the an. gambiae genome, meaningful comparisons of the te content of heterochromatin between mosquito and fruit fly are difficult.

unmapped genome assembly of an. gambiae
the unmapped portion of the agamp <dig> an. gambiae genome assembly comprises  <dig> mb  <cit> , i.e.~16% of the genome, and has  <dig> protein coding genes . the analysis of the genomic content of this "unknown chromosome"  revealed that the density of genes and the coverage of tes and microsatellites were similar to that of the heterochromatin . the highest coverage of minisatellites and satellites was detected in the "unknown chromosome" suggesting that the majority of these scaffolds belong to heterochromatin. two satellites, agy <dig> and ag53c, were mapped to the most proximal heterochromatin of the an. gambiae polytene chromosomes  <cit> . the location of satellite dna in the proximal pericentric heterochromatin has also been demonstrated in an. stephensi  <cit> . an enrichment with highly repetitive dna has been found in the compact heterochromatin of the an. macullipennis subgroup  <cit> . telomeres of the an. gambiae chromosomes do not display heterochromatic morphology. subtelomeric regions possess typical euchromatic banding patterns. however, molecular analysis of the telomeric end of the 2l arm demonstrated the presence of satellites and minisatellites  <cit> . therefore, the unmapped portion of the an. gambiae genome assembly likely contains sequences from the most proximal pericentric, most distal telomeric ends of chromosomes, and intercalary diffuse heterochromatin. in d. melanogaster,  <dig> mb of the unmapped portion of the genome was also enriched in tandem repeats and satellites  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
morphological identification and detailed physical mapping allowed us to define an expanded compartment of recognizable heterochromatin with distinct molecular features within the an. gambiae genome assembly. now about  <dig>  mb of mapped heterochromatin with  <dig> protein-coding genes is available for further characterization. go analysis revealed that heterochromatin is enriched in genes that encode for proteins that may be involved in epigenetic regulation of chromatin. this study described the large regions of intercalary heterochromatin with a morphology not seen in d. melanogaster. we also provided evidence that heterochromatin and euchromatin significantly differ in gene density and the coverage of rna tes and sds. the sequence composition, in terms of dna tes, rna tes, minisatellites, and satellites, can differentiate between the diffuse and compact types of intercalary heterochromatin. conversely, mars are distributed regardless of the chromatin type. the results of immunostaining with hp <dig> and lamin confirmed the general principle of nuclear organization--that the gene-poor regions of the genome reside at the nuclear periphery. future investigations of an. gambiae heterochromatin need to show whether specific molecular composition can actually lead to chromosome-ne interactions. given that the 42-mb-long "unknown chromosome" has the molecular characteristics of heterochromatin, it is possible that only one third of heterochromatic sequences in the an. gambiae genome assembly have been placed to chromosomes. finally, we found that pericentric islands of genomic divergence between m and s incipient species of an. gambiae are almost completely heterochromatic, demonstrating the elevated evolutionary plasticity of the mosquito heterochromatin.
