BACKGROUND
src homology  <dig>  are structurally conserved protein domains of approximately <dig> amino acids . sh <dig> domains regulate numerous intracellular signal transduction events through interaction with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins  <cit> . within the human genome,  <dig> distinct genes encode for  <dig> sh <dig> domains  <cit> . sh <dig> domains consist of an n-terminal alpha helix  flanking a central five-stranded anti-parallel beta sheet  followed by a second alpha helix  and a c-terminal beta strand  <cit>  . the five strands of the central beta sheet separate a conserved phosphotyrosine binding pocket from a more variable pocket that typically binds the third amino acid c-terminal to the phosphorylated tyrosine.

detailed structural analyses have revealed specific and unique features of different sh <dig> domains suggesting that these domains, while ubiquitous and highly conserved, nevertheless exhibit unique specificity determining features. for example, nmr analysis of the sh <dig> domain of inducible tec kinase  showed that its binding specificity is modulated by cis-trans isomerization of a single proline  <cit> . structural analysis of the sh2d1a gene product, slam associated protein , revealed the structural basis for a phosphotyrosine independent three-pronged binding mechanism of peptides to its sh <dig> domain  <cit> . similarly, a disulphide bond in the sh <dig> domain of the c-terminal src kinase  was found to be central for the kinase activity  <cit> .

the function and specificity determining elements of many sh <dig> domain containing proteins, are still not well characterised. one of these is the t cell specific adapter protein , encoded by the sh2d2a gene and expressed in activated t cells  <cit>  and endothelial cells  <cit> . tsad contains one sh <dig> domain, followed by a proline rich region and possesses ligands for sh <dig> and sh <dig> domains  <cit> . hitherto only a few ligands for the human tsad sh <dig> domain are known, including the phosphorylated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  <dig>   <cit> , and the phosphorylated valocin containing protein   <cit> . recruitment of tsad via sh <dig> domain binding to phosphorylated y <dig> in the vegfr <dig> receptor controls migration of  <cit>  as well as permeability  <cit>  of endothelial cells. similarly, binding of tsad via its sh <dig> domain to vcp is required for nuclear translocation of tsad  <cit> . preliminary results from our lab indicate that the tsad-sh <dig> domain has additional ligands in activated t cells . given the interesting biology surrounding tsad, and the role of sh <dig> domains in mediating important interactions in the context of cell signalling, we wanted to characterize the structure of tsad sh <dig>  however, when expressed as a gst-fusion protein in e. coli, the tsad sh <dig> domain was found to be highly insoluble presenting a significant challenge to detailed structural characterization.

an algorithm for prediction of amyloid fibril formation in eukaryote cells, tango, has been developed  <cit> , and it has been suggested that tango may also predict inclusion body formation in prokaryotic cells  <cit> . here we report that tango predicts the solubility of recombinant sh <dig> domains expressed in e.coli, and that predictions made by tango allowed for targeted mutations that significantly improved the solubility of the recombinant protein.

RESULTS
low solubility of bacterially expressed human tsad sh <dig> domain
to perform biochemical and structural studies on the tsad sh <dig> domain, we initially generated a gst-fusion construct  including the flanking amino acids 67– <dig> and 189– <dig>  the resulting gst-tsad sh <dig> domain was expressed mainly as insoluble inclusion bodies . in contrast, the gst-lck sh <dig> protein containing only minimal gene-derived flanking sequence was primarily expressed in the soluble fraction . although small amounts of recombinant gst-tsad sh <dig> was present in the lysate, most of this soluble fraction could be captured on glutathione sepharose beads . anti-gst-immunoblotting of equal amounts of the soluble fractions compared to a defined amount of purified, soluble gst , revealed that the yield of the tsad sh <dig> domain) was only  <dig>  mg/l bacterial cell culture, while that of lck-sh <dig> was estimated to be close to 20 mg/l bacterial culture .

flanking sequences, growth temperature and genetic variation influence recombinant expression of tsad sh <dig> domains
having found that the protein yield of the tsad-sh <dig> domain construct was only a fraction of that of the lck-sh <dig> construct, additional constructs including different lengths of the sequence flanking the human tsad sh <dig> domain and three different vector-encoded c-termini  were generated. when expressed at room temperature, the yield of these tsad sh <dig> domain constructs varied considerably as judged by commassie staining of sds-gels. compared to the tsad-67-207-ivtd construct , truncation of the sequence n- and/or c-terminal to the tsad sh <dig> domain yielded approximately equal levels of expressed protein . by contrast the tsad-90-188-phrd  construct was not expressed at all . this construct only differed from tsad-90-188-paas  in its c-terminal vector-derived sequence, and from tsad-67-188-phrd  in that the latter includes  <dig> aa n- terminal to the sh <dig> domain .

growth temperature affects the solubility of recombinant proteins in e.coli <cit> . expression at 15°c resulted in higher yield of soluble tsad sh <dig> domain from the tsad-67-207-ivtd , tsad-90-207-ivtd , tsad-81-193-paas  and tsad-90-188-paas  constructs, whereas solubility and expression of the tsad-67-188-phrd  and tsad-90-188-phrd  constructs remained unchanged . we also tested whether the genetic variation inherent in species differences  affected expression of tsad sh <dig> domains. analysis of solubility and yield of identically cloned tsad sh <dig> domains derived from three different species , mtsad-111-210-aaas  and rtsad-111-210-aaas , table 1) revealed slightly improved solubility at 15°c of murine tsad sh <dig> compared to human and rat . taken together, both gene- and vector-derived sequence influence the overall expression and solubility of recombinant tsad-sh <dig> proteins. however, none of the conditions tested resulted in amounts of soluble recombinant tsad sh <dig> domain sufficient for structural analysis.

the tsad sh <dig> domain contains a short peptide sequence promoting intermolecular beta-sheet aggregation
in order to examine whether the tsad sh <dig> domain has some intrinsic property limiting its solubility in prokaryotic cells  <cit> , we took advantage of an algorithm for prediction of beta-aggregation stretches in proteins  <cit> , tango . tango analysis of the human tsad sh <dig> domain sequence  revealed that the βc strand of the human tsad sh <dig> domain  harbours a nine aa sequence  with near 100% propensity for intermolecular beta-sheet aggregation . similar results were obtained for the murine and rat sequences, whereas no beta-aggregating regions were found in the lck-sh <dig> domain, nor in the tsad homologue alx sh <dig>  <cit>  . in silico substitution of the tsad sequence avtfvlt to the corresponding alx sequence hvgytls and vice versa, reduced the predicted beta-aggregation propensity of the tsad sh <dig> domain to near zero, whereas the alx sh <dig> domain attained beta-aggregation propensity similar to that of the native tsad sh <dig> domain . further in silico replacements revealed that exchange of the tfv sequence in tsad to the gyt sequence of alx, resulted in a 90% reduction in the overall beta-aggregation propensity of tsad sh <dig> . as the structure of the tsad-sh <dig> domain is not yet determined, we instead compared the structures of the lck-sh <dig> domain and the alx-sh <dig> domain to visualize the putative localisation of the tfv sequence in the sh <dig> domain structure . the tripeptide region corresponding to the tsad-sh <dig> tfv sequence  is highlighted. as can be seen from the space filling models the ser  <dig> and ser  <dig> in lck, and all three amino acids in the alx-motif , are solvent accessible. given the structural conservation between sh <dig> domain folds, it is likely that at least part of the tfv sequence in tsad-sh <dig> may be solvent exposed. when the tfv sequence from tsad-sh <dig> was in silico replaced with the gyt sequence in the alx-sh <dig> domain sequence, the tango algorithm predicted an increase in beta-aggregation propensity corresponding to the tfv sequence . to directly test the predictions made by tango, we generated tfv → gyt and fv → yt mutants of the tsad-90-188-phrd and tsad-90-188-paas constructs, and compared their expression to that of the alx sh <dig> domain. these constructs were chosen, as they contained the shortest flanking sequences compared to the original tsad 1-td construct, and were thus better suited for the planned down stream analysis. the tfv → gyt mutation increased both yield and solubility of the tsad sh <dig> domains , most dramatically for the tsad-90-188-phrd construct, which was not expressed as soluble protein in its wild type form . as predicted by tango , the fv → yt replacement influenced solubility of the tsad sh <dig> domain produced by tsad-90-188-paas to a lesser extent, and had no effect in the tsad-90-188-phrd construct . compared to the original tsad-sh <dig> construct  which consistently yielded  <dig>  mg/l bacterial culture , the yield of soluble wild type tsad-90-188-paas protein was doubled, and was further increased by 50% when mutated to gyt , yielding close to  <dig>  mg recombinant protein per liter bacterial cell culture. for the tsad-90-188-phrd protein mutated to gyt, the yield of soluble protein was doubled  compared to the original 1-td construct . when the reverse experiment was performed, replacing gyt sequence in the alx sh <dig> domain with tfv, no adverse effect on solubility was observed . an overview of the tango-predicted aggregation scores and yield of soluble protein for the various sh <dig> domains included in this study are given in table  <dig>  thus, taken together tango predictions allowed for targeted mutations resulting in increased solubility of the tsad sh <dig> domain in prokaryotic cells. however, the insertion of the tfv sequence alone into the alx-sh <dig> domain was not enough to render this protein insoluble, indicating that tango will not always be able to predict solubility of recombinant proteins in e.coli.

mutant gst-tsad sh <dig> domain binds to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins
pull-down assays were performed to test whether the targeted mutations negatively influenced the function of the tsad sh <dig> domain. tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was induced in jurkat t cells by anti-cd <dig> triggering. lysates from stimulated cells were subjected to pull-down assay, using wild type and gyt-mutated gst-tsad sh <dig> . both constructs pulled down the same tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, although smaller amounts were pulled down using the gyt- mutated protein. however, some protein bands seemed to be more affected by the gyt mutation than others . to further analyze the binding specificity of the mutated tsad sh <dig> domain, peptide arrays representing phosphopeptides from vegfr- <dig> and vcp, the two known tsad sh <dig> domain ligands, were probed with wild type or mutated tsad sh <dig>  domain. the results show that both tsad wild type and gyt-mutated protein bind to vegfr- <dig> phosphopeptide  and vcp , whereas binding to vcp py <dig> was lost for the gyt-mutant . the gyt → tfv replacement in alx sh <dig> domain did not alter the specificity towards the selected phosphopeptides . taken together, the results show that although the mutant protein may have retained all or most of the assessed functions of the wild type protein, the specificity determining elements of the mutated protein domain may be altered. this should be carefully addressed when mutations are introduced for the purpose of increasing the solubility of the expressed protein.

low beta-aggregation values predict high solubility of recombinant sh <dig> domains
having found that tango could predict increased solubility of the tsad-sh <dig> domain, we then asked whether beta-aggregation propensity is a common characteristic of sh <dig> domains. most of the  <dig> sh <dig> domains encoded by the human genome have been expressed as recombinant his-  <cit>  or gst-fusion proteins  <cit> . all available human sh <dig> domain sequences  <cit>  were analysed by tango  and results were correlated to the recently published information on sh <dig> solubility. sh <dig> domains displaying low solubility had significantly higher beta-aggregation values than sh <dig> domains which were soluble  <cit>   and  <cit>  . similarly, the percentage of recombinant sh <dig> domains present as monomers  as evaluated by analytical size exclusion chromatography  <cit> , was inversely correlated with high beta-aggregation values .

discussion
expression of recombinant proteins is an important step forward for structural and functional analysis of entire proteins and isolated protein domains. the choice of tag may affect the solubility of the protein  <cit>  and various parameters for successful expression of heterologous recombinant proteins have previously been reported  <cit> . however, there is no particular way to predict whether a protein will be soluble when expressed in e.coli. having an interest in elucidating the function of the sh <dig> domain containing protein tsad, we discovered that its sh <dig> domain was mainly insoluble when expressed in e.coli, as was also noted by others  <cit>  but not all  <cit> . although alteration in flanking sequence and growth temperature influenced expression and solubility of tsad sh <dig>  overall yield of soluble protein remained low.

protein aggregation and amyloid fibril formation in degenerative diseases such as alzheimer’s disease resembles the process of inclusion body formation in e.coli <cit> . to our knowledge targeted mutation to relieve propensity for intermolecular beta-aggregation and increase solubility of recombinant proteins has not previously been reported, although the opposite experiment has been performed: de groot and ventura fused green fluorescent protein  to a mutated aβ <dig> alzheimer peptide to generate an aggregation prone reporter for monitoring protein quality in inclusion bodies by measuring gfp emission spectra  <cit> . our results show that identification of aggregation prone proteins in silico allow for targeted mutations to increase solubility of the recombinant protein. provided the overall structure and function of the recombinant protein are retained, this is a potentially efficient strategy to generate soluble recombinant protein for downstream purposes.

aggregating peptide sequences are common within the hydrophobic core of globular proteins  <cit> . accordingly, the beta-aggregating sequence identified by tango in the tsad-sh <dig> domain ) was found in βc located in the core of the sh <dig> domain. histidines, arginines or prolines are preferred immediately prior to, and after, aggregating sequences in the proteome. these gatekeeper amino acids may counteract beta-aggregating propensity, and may also serve as recognition sites for chaperones  <cit> . although sh <dig> domains share overall structure, there is large sequence variability between individual domains of the family  <cit> . interestingly, although most sh <dig> domains did not harbour aggregating βc sequences, the large majority still had histidine, arginine or proline flanking the βc sequence on each side . this suggests that protein domain families may have evolved to resist the potential deleterious effects of beta-aggregating propensity of globular proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that tango, an algorithm developed to predict amyloid fibril formation and aggregation of peptides, may also predict the solubility of recombinant sh <dig> domains expressed in e.coli. predictions made by tango may allow for targeted mutations that significantly improve the solubility of the recombinant protein. mutations introduced for the purpose of increasing the solubility of the expressed protein may alter specificity determining elements of the mutated protein domain.
