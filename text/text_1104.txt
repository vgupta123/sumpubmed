BACKGROUND
production economy is a greater challenge in industrial production of biosurfactants. successful production depends on the development of low-cost production processes and readily available raw materials which could reduce the cost of production process substantially  <cit> . development of economical engineering processes and the use of low cost feedstock for microorganism growth and surfactant production could reduce the production cost  <cit> . it is a well-known fact that microorganisms are immensely affected by conditions that prevail surrounding them. variations in carbon and nitrogen sources along with its stabilization at different ph and temperature have resulted in increased yield of biosurfactants. metal supplementation was reported to be one of the critical factors required for enhanced production of biosurfactants  <cit> . among the metal ions, fe is the key microelement for biosurfactant production in several microorganisms  <cit> . based on our previous bioprocess optimization for production of biosurfactants by marine actinobacteria  <cit> , it was established that metal ions such as fecl <dig>  cuso <dig>  mncl <dig>  and mgso <dig> had significantly influenced biosurfactant production. among the metal ions screened, fecl <dig> was most appropriate metal precursor for the production of biosurfactant by marine actinobacteria followed by cuso <dig>  makkar and cameotra  <cit>  reported that the biosurfactant production increased considerably  by the addition of metal supplements. considering the significant role of metal ion on biosurfactant production, the present study was initiated to evaluate the effect of metal  nps on biosurfactant production.

nanoparticles  have been hypothesized to be influence microbial production, growth and survival. previous reports evidenced the effect of different nps on the growth and secondary metabolite production in various microorganisms  <cit> . but reports revealed that nps like ag, au and oxides of al, ti, si and zn have detrimental effect on the cells of microorganisms  <cit> . fe was considered as an essential element with many other novel properties, such as enhanced surface-to-volume ratio, super-paramagnetism and inherent biocompatibility  <cit> . because of using fe atom in several pathways of metabolism, low iron toxicity is expected on the usage of fe nps  <cit> . in this background, the present study aims to determine the effect of fe nps on biosurfactant production by marine actinobacterium under solid state culture .

RESULTS
isolation and identification of biosurfactant producer msa13a
this report is an outcome of bioprospecting of actinobacteria associated with marine sponge dendilla nigra. among the  <dig> stable isolates , the strains msa <dig>  msa <dig>  msa13a, msa <dig> and msa <dig> were considered as potential biosurfactant producers. in the present study, we report the biosurfactant production potential of msa13a. the results of screening tests performed on msa13a include hemolytic activity , oil displacement , lipase activity , positive drop collapsing test and emulsification activity . the isolate hydrolyzed starch, gelatin, chitin, cellulose and tributyrin. the 16s rrna sequence of the isolate msa13a was further analyzed using ncbi blastn tool with a query to limit the search for closest biosurfactant producing relatives. representatives of maximum homologous sequences from the search were used for the construction of phylogenetic tree using upgma algorithm. the isolate msa13a showed clustering with prominent biosurfactant producers bacillus and pseudomonas. these findings revealed that the isolate msa13a was an actinobacterial strain producing extracellular biosurfactants. based on the homology and similarity, the isolate was classified as nocardiopsis sp. msa13a. sponge-associated actinobacteria have been reported to be prolific source of secondary metabolite producers  <cit>  and suggested to attribute largely to the chemical defense mechanisms of their host sponges against predators with biologically active compounds  and biofouling .

interaction of nps with actinobacterium
foam method was used in the production of fe nps which were long and fiber shaped in nature . the diameter of the synthesized fe nps was about 40 nm and they were around 1 μm in length. the sem results showed fibrous shape of the fe nps along with their approximate size. eds analysis evidenced iron to be the metal in fe nps synthesized . absence of oxygen indicated that the fe nps had not undergone oxidation even though mild exposure to air during the synthesis process. uv–vis spectroscopy of fe nps showed an absorption peak at 230 nm . fe nps obviously show peaks at 216 nm and 268 nm in distilled water  <cit> . the strong absorbance obtained at a wavelength <250 nm indicated that the size of the fe nps synthesized was < 40 nm. it was observed that the highest densities of colonies were appeared on the plate with 10 mg/l of fe nanoparticle. no significant change was observed between fresh and one week old fe nps. growth rate of nocardiopsis msa13a was induced significantly by fe nps at 10 mg/l. the effect of fe nps at 100 mg/l and lower than 10 mg/l showed least or no effect on the growth of nocardiopsis msa13a. the reduction in cell density on addition of high concentration of fe nps was probably due to aggregation in the medium leading to damage of the growing cell  <cit> . the present study evidenced fe nps was non-toxic to actinobacterium whereas cu nps were reported to be toxic to bacterial cells  <cit> . little change was observed with one week old fe nps indicating the variation in toxicity of the nps probably due to their oxidation but still the overall effect had remained the same. to avoid oxidative effect on fe nps, the present study was carried out with freshly prepared fe nps. the fe nps positively interacted with actinobacterium which was evident from the intact filamentous morphology of nocardiopsis msa13a treated with 10 mg/l of fe nps for 4 h .

influence of fe nps on biosurfactant production
the production of biosurfactant by nocardiopsis msa13a was increased to 80% over control  at 10 mg/l fe nps . it was recorded that the production of biosurfactant decreased at higher concentration of fe nps. the initial increase in production was due to the effect of fe nanoparticle providing more nutrition to the organism by activation of the medium  <cit> . electron donating nature of the fe2+ ion has been studied previously which satiates the demand of the organism for electron  <cit> . ehrlich  <cit>  reported that some bacteria can acquire energy for growth from oxidation of fe2+ to fe3+. fe is an important enzyme activator, specifically of isocitrate lyase, an enzyme involved in cell growth on hydrophobic substrates. this enzyme is essential for cell to modulate metabolic pathway of acetyl-coa and convert it into a c <dig> unit during biosurfactant synthesis  <cit> . the microorganisms have developed a variety of strategies for acquiring iron while simultaneously protecting them from the potential toxicity of iron  <cit> . the main strategies used by bacteria and fungi to acquire iron include producing and utilizing siderophores.

optimization of biosurfactant production under ssc
the production of biosurfactant by nocardiopsis msa13a was increased substantially with treated molasses  as substrate  followed by tannery pretreated sludge , pre-treated molasses , tannery treated sludge  and wheat bran . enhanced biosurfactant production by nocardiopsis msa13a under ssc was achieved with glucose as carbon source, yeast extract as nitrogen source, ph  <dig> , 2% nacl, and asparagine as amino acid. the production of biosurfactant by nocardiopsis msa13a was consistently increased between 30°c and 40°c. the influence of metal ions such as cuso <dig>  mncl <dig>  mgso <dig> and fecl <dig> on the production of biosurfactant by nocardiopsis msa13a was evaluated under ssc. among the metal ions screened, fecl <dig> was most essential metal ion for enhanced biosurfactant production by nocardiopsis msa13a followed by cuso <dig>  the strain showed maximum production on the substrate inoculated with  <dig>  ml inoculum. the moisture content required for the maximum production of biosurfactant was >80%. factors optimized under one-factor at a time experiments are given in supplementary figure. the strain nocardiopsis msa13a produced maximum biosurfactant on treated molasses with 3% glucose as carbon source and 2% yeast extract as nitrogen source . the strain required a higher amount of carbon source compared to that of the nitrogen source concentration based on the effect of c/n ratio.

optimization of biosurfactant production using response surface methodology 
statistical optimization of biosurfactant production was carried out by design-expert software package . the r <dig> value of  <dig>  which was closer to  <dig> shows the model to be stronger and it can better predict the response. the model was found to be significant with p <  <dig>  and insignificant lack of fit . the behavior of the system is explained by the following quadratic model equation

 y=40+ <dig> x1- <dig> x2- <dig> x3- <dig> x4+16x12+ <dig> x22+ <dig> x32- <dig> x42+ <dig> x1x2+ <dig> x1x3- <dig> x1x4+ <dig> x2x3- <dig> x2x4- <dig> x3x <dig> 

validation of the model
the predicted value of y by the above explained quadratic model was found to be 72%. the experimental value obtained was 83%. the difference in the predicted and the experimental value can be attributed to fe nps. the fe nps might have induced the metabolic pathway of biosurfactant synthesis. it was found that the production was significantly influenced by the variables such as glucose, yeast extract, fe nps and inoculum size either interactively and/or independently. a significant interactive influence of primary control factors such as glucose and yeast extract was validated in the rsm design. the glucose and yeast extract interactively reached a central value to influence the production maxima over a stable area . the fe nps and inoculum size interactively increase the production and the stable production was attained with the influence of both factors independently . the present results are first report on the optimization of biosurfactant production using fe nps.

chemical characterization of biosurfactant
based on the tlc analysis, carbohydrate and lipid fractions were separated. the ft-ir spectra  and gc-ms data  showed that the compound produced by nocardiopsis msa13a was a glycolipid with a hydrophobic non-polar hydrocarbon chain  and hydrophilic part of the compound being a sugar methyl-4- o-methyl-β-d-xylopyranoside. retention times, relative intensities  and eims of the relevant peaks are as follows: peak a:  <dig> ,  <dig>  eims m/z ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  . peak b:  <dig> ,  <dig>  eims m/z ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> . it was established that gc-ms was a standard technique in carbohydrate analysis  <cit>  and based on the previous reports, the peaks obtained the present study was matched with methyl-4- o-methyl-β-d-xylopyranoside.

antibiofilm activity of biosurfactant
a prominent shrimp pathogen vibrio aliginolyticus treated with 300 μg/ml of biosurfactant significantly disrupted the pre-formed biofilm . the biofilm disruption was indicated by the absence of visible film on the wall and bottom of the tube when the glass tube was incubated with biosurfactant  for 30 min at 28°c. lower concentration was effective but not disrupted the biofilm completely. vibriosis was by far the most significant factor of aquaculture loss in many countries. vibrio is a serious pathogen of marine fish and invertebrates, particularly penaeid shrimp  <cit> . the finding of the present study brings out a new biosurfactant derivative from marine actinobacterium which could effectively disrupt pathogenic biofilms.

CONCLUSIONS
identification of bacterial responses provides vital information on the influence of nps on microorganism. due to their tiny size and stabilization  <cit> , as well as high surface to volume ratio nanomaterials can easily influence the growth as well as secondary metabolite production of microorganisms, but this effect is not always negative in nature. in this study fe nps was used to enhance biosurfactant production by actinobacterium, since fe is an essential nutrient for almost all microorganisms because it plays an important role in optimum cell growth as well as cofactor for a large number of enzymes, is a part of cytochromes and is required for many biochemical reaction, including respiration, photosynthetic transport, and dna synthesis  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that the use of metal salt as supplements in the fermentation process would retain the non-metal salt ions such as cl- or so42- as impurity in the medium. therefore, the use of metal nps as supplement would reduce residual effect of metal salts in the fermentation products. based on the findings, the nps could be used as inducer of metabolic pathway of actinobacterium for enhanced production of biosurfactant under ssc. the present study evidenced that the biosurfactant can be used to effectively disrupt and/or to prevent vibrio sp. biofilms in shrimp aquaculture.
