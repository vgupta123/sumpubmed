BACKGROUND
about 80% of all mammalian proteins and 50% of yeast proteins are estimated to be cotranslationally acetylated at their n-termini  <cit> . this clearly makes n-terminal acetylation one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotic cells. in yeast, three complexes, nata, natb and natc, express different substrate specificities and are responsible for the majority of n-terminal acetylation  <cit> . at present, the nomenclature of this class of enzymes is not coherent and later this year a revised nomenclature of this enzyme class will be presented . in brief, for the proteins mentioned in this study the following names will apply: naa10p , naa11p , naa15p , naa16p  and naa50p . the yeast nata complex contains the structural subunit naa15p mediating ribosome association and the catalytic subunit naa10p  <cit> . deletion of ynaa <dig> and ynaa <dig> results in a number of common defects including lack of go entry, reduced cell growth, and inability to sporulate  <cit> . the subunit naa50p is also physically associated with naa10p and naa15p, but the function of hnaa50p is unknown  <cit> . the human nata, natb and natc complexes were recently characterized  <cit> . the human nata complex contains the human homologues of the yeast nata components hnaa10p, hnaa15p and hnaa50p  <cit> . the function and substrate specificity of hnata in vivo and in vitro were found to resemble that of the yeast nata complex  <cit> . the yeast naa <dig> gene is duplicated in mammals. in humans, the naa <dig> duplication has lead to the generation of a novel protein designated hnaa11p  <cit> . similarly to hnaa10p, hnaa11p potentially interacts with hnaa15p implying that two distinct nata complexes may exist in human cells: both hnaa15p-hnaa10p and hnaa15p-hnaa11p  <cit> . however, an endogenous hnaa15p-hnaa11p complex has not yet been detected, thus the functional importance of hnaa11p remains to be elucidated. hnaa10p and hnaa15p were previously demonstrated to be important for normal cellular viability. rna interference-mediated knockdown of hnaa <dig> or hnaa <dig> induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human cell lines  <cit> , thus hnaa10p has been proposed to be a novel cancer drug target  <cit> . on the other hand, it has also been reported that hnaa10p is essential for the induction of apoptosis since knockdown of hnaa10p protected cells against doxorubicin induced apoptosis  <cit> .

in order to identify novel interaction partners of hnaa10p, we performed immunoprecipitation of hnaa10p from hek <dig> cells, followed by trypsin digestion of immunoprecipitated proteins and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry. we here demonstrate the existence of an endogenous hnaa16p protein, encoded by a human paralogue of the hnaa <dig> gene representing a new orthologue of the yeast naa <dig> gene. hnaa <dig> mrna is generally expressed in human cells. the hnaa16p protein associates with ribosomes, and interacts with hnaa10p to form a novel human nata complex.

RESULTS
identification of hnaa16p and the hnaa16p-hnaa10p complex
we used an immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry approach to identify novel interaction partners of hnaa10p. endogenous hnaa10p was collected from hek <dig> cell extracts using a hnaa10p-specific antibody. the immunoprecipitates were analysed by lc/ms/ms after trypsin digestion. in addition to hnaa10p, hnaa15p and hnaa50p  <cit> , we identified a novel protein, hnaa16p , in each of four parallel affinity extractions obtained using anti-hnaa10p. both hnaa15p and hnaa16p were identified by several unique peptides. neither hnaa10p nor hnaa15p nor hnaa16p were present in four negative controls using unspecific immunoglobulins. the identified hnaa15p and hnaa16p specific peptides are presented in figure  <dig> and in additional file  <dig>  the ms/ms spectra of two of these peptides, raielattldesltnr  and dlesfnedflk  are shown in figure  <dig>  from the alignments  it is obvious that the two proteins hnaa15p and hnaa16p are highly similar. according to ncbi bl2seq  <cit> , hnaa15p and hnaa16p share 70% identity and 85% similarity at the amino acid level. in figure  <dig>  hnaa15p and hnaa16p structural domains as identified by smart  <cit>  are presented. both proteins contain several tetratricopeptide  domains which are degenerate  <dig> amino acids repeats containing a helix-loop-helix presumed to be involved in protein-protein interactions. hnaa15p is predicted to contain  <dig> tprs while hnaa16p is predicted to have  <dig> tprs. this difference results from program threshold values chosen, and since both proteins are highly similar in this region, it is likely that also hnaa15p may have a fifth tpr domain in the same region. both proteins contain coiled-coil domains . also the exon-intron organisation for the two genes is highly similar .

the interaction between hnaa16p and hnaa10p appears to be independent of the hnaa15p-hnaa10p complex since hnaa16p-specific peptides were not present in anti-hnaa15p immunoprecipitates analysed in parallel. since both hnaa15p and hnaa16p interact with hnaa10p, it is of interest to determine the approximate ratio of hnaa15p versus hnaa16p in complex with hnaa10p. to make a rough and qualitative estimate of the amounts of hnaa15p and hnaa16p complexed with hnaa10p, the protein abundance index  <cit>  was calculated for each protein as the number of lc/ms/ms-observed tryptic peptides  divided by the total number of tryptic peptides that could be identified by sequest under the exact search conditions used. for hnaa15p, this number was  <dig> , while for hnaa16p it was  <dig> . hnaa15p-hnaa10p complexes thus appear to be roughly 6-fold more abundant than hnaa16p-hnaa10p complexes in hek <dig> cells. as an additional verification of the hnaa16p-hnaa10p interaction, we expressed tagged hnaa16p-flag and hnaa10p-v <dig> in hela cells and demonstrated that hnaa16p-flag was co-immunoprecipitated with hnaa10p-v <dig> . in conclusion, these observations clearly support the presence of an endogenous hnaa16p-hnaa10p complex in human cells. furthermore, we also wanted to test whether hnaa16p could interact with hnaa11p, since the latter protein is very similar to hnaa10p. the co-immunoprecipitation experiments using hnaa16p-flag and hnaa11p-v <dig>  demonstrated that this indeed is the case .

expression of hnaa <dig> and hnaa <dig> in human cell lines
to investigate the expression of these two human homologues of the yeast naa <dig> gene, we analysed the expression of hnaa <dig> and hnaa <dig> mrna by quantitative rt-pcr in  <dig> human cell lines of various origin  and  <dig> human cell lines originating from the thyroid gland . both genes are highly expressed in hepg <dig> , hek <dig> , and sk-mel <dig>  cell lines. our results demonstrate that hnaa <dig> is expressed in all cell lines analyzed, and hnaa <dig> is the most abundant species of the two. the expression level of hnaa <dig> mrna is 2– <dig> times than that of hnaa <dig> mrna in cell lines like tad- <dig> and hepg <dig>  while it is 7– <dig> times more abundant in gamg, sk-n-mc, hela, and b-cpap cells. interestingly, in hek <dig> cells, hnaa <dig> mrna is  <dig> times more abundant as compared to hnaa <dig> mrna. although there is not necessarily a direct relationship between the level of a specific mrna and the level of the corresponding protein, this agrees with our rough estimates that hnaa15p-hnaa10p complexes appear to be 6-fold more abundant than hnaa16p-hnaa10p complexes in hek <dig> cells, thus suggesting that the level of the various nata complexes present is proportional to the presence of their single subunits. tissue expression profiles for hnaa <dig> and hnaa <dig> mrna also indicate that hnaa <dig> mrna is generally more abundant as compared to hnaa <dig> . however, in certain tissues like adrenal gland, mammary gland, heart, testis and thymus, hnaa <dig> appears to be the dominant species . previously, it was demonstrated that hnaa <dig> was overexpressed in papillary thyroid carcinomas as compared to non-neoplastic thyroid tissue  <cit> . the current data support these observations since hnaa <dig> is slightly or significantly overexpressed in all types of thyroid cancer cell lines tested as compared to the primary thyroid cells : follicular thyroid carcinoma , papillary thyroid carcinoma  and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma  . on the other hand, we are not able to make similar conclusions with respect to hnaa <dig> which appears to be expressed equally in tumour- and non-tumour thyroid cell lines.

evolution of the hnaa <dig> gene
the hnaa <dig> gene  is located to chromosome  <dig>  while the hnaa <dig> gene  is located to chromosome  <dig> . hnaa15p and hnaa16p belong to a protein family with members in saccharomyces cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans, ciona intestinalis, drosophila melanogaster, fish, frog and several higher mammals . the phylogenetic tree of this family  suggests that the duplication that resulted in hnaa <dig> and hnaa <dig> occurred at some point after the speciation that resulted in the higher chordates , but before the speciation of mammals into eutheria and metatheria. the exact timing is confused by ciona branching before drosophila, and by the fish  appearing in only the naa <dig> clade . the duplication therefore occurred before the duplication that resulted in hnaa <dig> and hnaa <dig>  which we previously narrowed down to some time shortly after the divergence of eutheria and metatheria  <cit> .

additional file  <dig> presents an alignment of hnaa15p and hnaa16p protein sequences from human, mouse, and opossum, together with their homologues from ciona, zebrafish and yeast. with the exception of the yeast protein, the sequences are highly similar until approximately  <dig> residues from their c-termini. the similarity of the zebrafish protein to the naa15ps rather than the naa16ps is obvious from the alignment.

hnaa16p associates with ribosomes and hnaa16p-hnaa10p acetylates nata-type n-termini in vitro
the characterized hnaa15p-hnaa10p hnata complex interacts with ribosomes  <cit>  and n-terminally acetylates polypeptides with ser-, ala-, thr-, val- and gly- n-termini  <cit> . analyses of isolated polysomes demonstrated that hnaa16p-flag, as well as hnaa15p and hnaa10p, were both present in the polysomal and the soluble fractions  supporting a model where hnaa16p dynamically associates with ribosomes, and is involved in cotranslational nα-terminal acetylation. to assess whether the hnaa16p-hnaa10p complex expresses acetyltransferase activity, we performed in vitro n-terminal acetyltransferase assays using immunoprecipitated hnaa16p-hnaa10p and synthetic oligopeptides as substrates. a synthetic oligopeptide representing an acetylated protein n-terminus in hela cells, sess-, was acetylated in vitro by hnaa16p-hnaa10p, while an oligopeptide representing an n-terminus not acetylated in hela cells, sptp-, carrying an inhibitory pro in the second position  <cit> , is not efficiently acetylated in vitro . these results suggest that hnaa16p-hnaa10p and hnaa15p-hnaa10p have overlapping substrate specificities, since also the hnaa15p-hnaa10p complex showed a similar in vitro reactivity towards these peptides  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that in order to properly define the substrate specificity of the hnaa16p-hnaa10p complex, a more comprehensive approach is required.

hnaa <dig> knockdown downregulates hnaa10p and induces cell death
previously, we demonstrated that sirna-mediated knockdown of hnaa <dig> or hnaa <dig> induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human cell lines  <cit> . using sirna pools specific for hnaa <dig> and hnaa <dig>  we knocked down either gene in hela cells. semiquantitative rt-pcr analysis revealed that both sirna pools specifically reduced the expression of the targeted gene . western blotting analysis of cell lysates harvested  <dig> hours post sirna-transfection showed, as expected, that only sihnaa <dig>  not sihnaa <dig>  reduced the protein levels of hnaa15p . on the other hand, all three sirnas sihnaa <dig>  sihnaa <dig> and sihnaa <dig> significantly reduced protein levels of hnaa10p. the dependency of hnaa10p for hnaa15p has previously been described  <cit> , but the present results also indicate that a fraction of endogenous hnaa10p depend on hnaa16p for stability, albeit to a lesser extent as compared hnaa15p. this is in agreement with the relative presence of hnaa15p-hnaa10p versus hnaa16p-hnaa10p complexes described above.

knockdown of hnaa <dig> and hnaa <dig> induces apoptosis in hela cells  <cit> , and in the case of these cells, we demonstrated that hnaa <dig> knockdown reduced cell viability at comparable levels to hnaa <dig> knockdown as determined by a wst- <dig> assay . in order to investigate this phenotype, we analysed knockdown cells by live microscopy and observed the appearance of dead cells: cells detaching from monolayer had characteristic features of apoptosis . furthermore, by hoechst staining we observed a significant increase of pycnotic nuclei in hnaa <dig> and hnaa <dig> knockdown cells as compared to control cells . a similar observation was made using a tunel assay to detect dna fragmentation further supporting that knockdown of hnaa <dig> induces cell death, most likely apoptosis .

discussion
phylogenetic analysis provides strong support for a vertebrate gene duplication resulting in the two copies of the naa <dig> gene, possibly followed by loss of the second copy in fish. the presence of hnaa16p specific peptides in four of four parallel anti-hnaa10p immunoprecipitates is a strong indication of the presence of endogenous hnaa16p protein and of the presence of hnaa16p-hnaa10p complexes. both hnaa15p and hnaa16p are orthologues of the yeast naa15p. the simultaneous presence of hnaa15p and hnaa16p in anti-hnaa10p immunoprecipitates, and the lack of hnaa16p in anti-hnaa15p immunoprecipitates, indicate that hnaa15p-hnaa10p and hnaa16p-hnaa10p make distinct nata complexes in the cells. recently, we also demonstrated the presence of a second human orthologue of the yeast naa <dig> gene  <cit> . thus, two human orthologues of the yeast naa10p protein exist, hnaa10p and hnaa11p. however, to date there is no evidence of the presence of endogenous complexes consisting of hnaa11p and hnaa15p or hnaa16p. in mouse, two homologues of yeast naa <dig>  mnaa <dig> and mnaa <dig> , were detected at the mrna level  <cit> . in this study, mnaa <dig>  was found to be expressed at a lower level as compared to mnaa <dig> , in agreement with our results suggesting that hnaa <dig> is the dominant species as compared to hnaa <dig>  despite the lower abundance of hnaa <dig> mrna as compared to hnaa <dig> mrna, we find that hnaa <dig> is generally expressed in a number of human cell lines  and that knockdown of hnaa <dig> induces apoptosis , thus suggesting an important role for this novel gene. whether the hnaa <dig> knockdown phenotype is resulting from lack of n-terminally acetylated hnaa16p-hnaa10p substrates or whether it is coupled to another unknown function of hnaa16p remains to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have identified hnaa16p, a novel hnaa10p interactor. hnaa16p and hnaa10p most likely represent a novel human nata complex complementing the role of the hnaa15p-hnaa10p complex in protein nα-terminal acetylation in human cells. the fact that hnaa <dig> is widely expressed and that hnaa <dig> knockdown induces apoptosis points to hnaa16p as an essential human protein.
