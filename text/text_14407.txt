BACKGROUND
the objective of a time-course microarray experiment is to study the temporal dynamics of the expression profile for each gene. for many of these experiments, the primary objective is to identify genes for which these temporal profiles depend on a phenotypic, experimental or environmental factor. we mention three examples next. wang and kim  <cit>  identify genes in caenorhabditis elegans for which the expression level depends on the dauer state. graham et al.  <cit>  obtain rna expressions from kidney tissue from patients ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> years old, to identify genes whose expression profiles are age dependent while adjusting for other phenotypic factors. sekiguchi et al.  <cit>  study the mrna expression profiles of peripheral blood cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving a tnf-α inhibitor drug. henceforth, for notational brevity we refer to these temporal expression profiles as gene time-trajectories or simply time-trajectories whenever understood from the context.

there is an extensive recent body of literature on statistical methodology for identifying genes whose time-trajectories depend on a factor. we provide a brief summary of representative works. park et al.  <cit>  propose a permutation-based two-way anova model. luna and li  <cit>  propose a statistical framework based on a shape-invariant additive error model utilizing periodically expressed guide genes. storey et al.  <cit>  estimate gene expression time-trajectories using splines and then approximate the null sampling distribution of the goodness of fit statistic using a bootstrap method. sohn et al.  <cit>  extend this method to carry out the inference using permutation resampling. hong and li  <cit>  discuss a functional hierarchical model for detecting temporally differentially expressed genes between two experimental conditions for cross sectional designs, where the gene expression profiles are treated as functional data and modelled by basis function expansions. finally, angelini et al.  <cit>  use a bayesian hierarchical model along with bayes factors for the inference.

one common concern with using the methods described in the above papers, which are based on estimating mean functions, is their sensitivity to outliers which is a common issue in most microarray, including time-course, experiments. such outliers issue can be common in time-course microarray experiments. for example, our recent research  <cit>  identified genes with potential outlier presence in the caenorhabditis elegans dauer developmental data  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the observed and the fitted trajectory based on a natural spline basis of dimension four for nine genes with potential outlier presence. in this paper, we propose a robust testing method for identifying genes for which the gene-expression time-trajectories are different over time among k ≥  <dig> groups. the time-trajectories will be estimated using a quantile regression method. the discrepancy between the time-trajectories under the null hypothesis, where the time-trajectories for all k groups coincide, and the alternative, where the time-trajectory for some of the groups differ from the others, is quantified using an f-type goodness of fit statistic. given that we are testing for a large number of genes, we will also propose a permutation-based multiple testing procedure to accurately control the family-wise error rate .

the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. in the next section, we provide a technical overview of the proposed method. thereafter, we evaluate the procedure empirically using an extensive simulation study and by applying it to a published case study. we finalize the paper by a discussion of the empirical results and by considering extensions.

methods
we propose a robust method for identifying among m genes those whose expression time-trajectories depend on an experimental or phenotypic factor with say k ≥  <dig> groups or levels. we will assume that the expressions are observed at l distinct time-points, say  <dig> ≤ t <dig> < ... <tl and denote the number of observations for level k ∈ { <dig>  ..., k} of the factor at time l ∈ { <dig>  ..., l} by nkl. these time-points are assumed to be in common among the genes. furthermore, we will assume that at least one observation is observed for each group at each time-point . let  denote the expression measurements for m genes at time tl from subject i belonging to group k. for a given gene j, we will assume that the expression profile for group k will follow a distribution whose conditional median at time t is gkj. for each gene j, following the discussions in  <cit>  and  <cit> , we will estimate each of the k conditional median functions by considering a class of quantile smoothing splines as solutions to  

where . here  denotes the second derivative if gkj evaluated at t >  <dig>  the parameter λ is the smoothing parameter. here  denotes a class of "smooth" functions. each function gkj is estimated based on the expressions belonging to group k for gene j. for gene j the hypotheses of interest are formulated as testing  

versus  

note that under the null, the function g will no longer depend on k. as such, under the null we will consider estimating a single time-trajectory for each gene as a solution to  

the function gj is estimated based on all observations of gene j regardless of group membership by pooling within each time-point. following  <cit>  , we will employ a pre-specified p-dimensional linear spline basis, say w = , common to all m genes. the unknown parameters for gene j are denoted by βkj = . as discussed in  <cit>   the estimation can be carried out efficiently using linear programming methods. additional technical details for this optimization problem, including details about the family , are found in section  <dig> . <dig> of  <cit> . the corresponding residual error sum for group k is then given by  

where  are the corresponding estimators of the parameters. under the null, the corresponding residual error is given by  

we reject hj in favor of  for large values of the f-type statistic  

we note that the principal objective is not to test the marginal hypotheses hj versus . rather, we primarily aim to test the global null hypothesis  versus . to this end we will generate the null joint distribution of the test statistic  using a permutation resampling method. under the ℍ <dig> , for all the genes, the observations within each time-points are exchangeable. as such, a permutation sample under the null can be obtained by permuting the observation within each time-point. let n.l denote the number of observations at time l. the number of all possible permutations  

is all but small sample-size cases prohibitively large. therefore, we will approximate the exact sampling distribution using b random permutations. the fwer is defined by the probability of rejecting any null hypothesis hj under ℍ <dig> . we will employ a single-step multiple testing procedure controlling the fwer as described in  <cit>  and  <cit> . the algorithm is summarized as follows.

RESULTS
we investigate the performance of our method by conducting an extensive simulation study. this will be followed by a discussion of the application of our method to the caenorhabditis elegans dauer developmental data discussed in  <cit> . these discussions will be limited to the two-sample case . for notation brevity, we will refer to genes whose time-trajectory depends on the factor as prognostic and non-prognostic otherwise. similarly, we will refer to the genes whose corresponding fwer p-value is less than the given nominal level as significant or non-significant otherwise. for all of these illustrations, as in  <cit> , we will employ a b-spline basis with knots placed at the  <dig>  1/,2/, ..., /,  <dig> quantiles of the observed time points pooled across both samples. for these illustration we set p =  <dig>  our method is developed within the framework of regression for estimation, and permutation resampling for the inference. for additional notational brevity we will adopt the acronym -perm to refer to our method. to put the discussions in comparative perspective, alongside our results, we will provide those obtained by the permutation method of  <cit>  and the bootstrap method by  <cit> . given that these are regression methods, we will denote them by -perm and -boot respectively. all of these analyses are carried out using the r statistical environment  <cit> . the function rq from the quantreg package  <cit>  is used to estimate the quantile regression functions.

simulation study
for the simulation study, the expressions will be generated from an outlier contaminated additive error model of the form  

the first term, μkj, denotes the time-trajectory function at time tl for group k. for non-prognostic genes, we will set μ1j = μ2j =  <dig> while for prognostic genes, we will specify μ1j =  <dig> and μ2j =  <dig> e-t respectively. the error terms are mutually independent and identically distributed according to a standard normal law. the second term in the model, aklij , represents the random outlier which will assume a value of  <dig>   <dig>  or - <dig> with probabilities π/ <dig>   <dig> - π and π/ <dig> respectively. in the case of a normal law, the mean and median coincide. as such, in the absence of the outlier effect  the quantile function gkj = μkj for all t >  <dig> 

for these simulations, we will adopt a design similar to the caenorhabditis elegans dauer developmental data, by choosing  <dig> time points t =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  we will generate four replicates at each time-point from each group .

to evaluate the fwer, we generate m =  <dig> non-prognostic genes. a block exchangeable correlation structure with correlation coefficient ρ and block sizes of  <dig>  is imposed on the measurement errors. the null distribution of the test statistic is approximated from b =  <dig> resampling  replicates. empirical fwer is computed as the proportion of samples rejecting ℍ <dig> by our testing procedure at a two-sided fwer level of  <dig>  among n =  <dig> simulations. simulation results are reported in table  <dig> 

as shown in table  <dig>  under the simulation model  <dig>  where the outlier effects are identically distributed over the time-points, all three methods control the type i error rate. under simulation model  <dig>  where only the first and last time-points are contaminated by the outlier effect, the -boot method however fails to control the type i error rate. in this case, the type i error rate based on the -boot method is seemingly inflated by a factor of three when π =  <dig>  or by a factor of six when π =  <dig> . this can be explained by the fact that the parametric regression bootstrap is based on the assumption of homoscedasticity of the error terms.

under simulation model  <dig>  the error terms as the sum of the outlier and measurement error components, although no longer normally distributed, are identically distributed within and among all time-points and groups. under simulation model  <dig>  the error terms are no longer homoscedastic. as such, it is not surprising that the -boot method may not be adequate in this situation.

to investigate the global power  of this procedure, we generate  <dig> prognostic genes and  <dig> non-prognostic genes. a correlation structure similar to that of the fwer case is specified. the corresponding results are reported in table  <dig> 

as illustrated in table  <dig>  in the absence of an outlier effect, the power for our method is slightly lower than the other two methods. as this effect becomes more pronounced, our method gains an advantage with respect to power. a similar trend is observed under simulation model  <dig>  one should note that the power listed for -boot under this scenario is not the power at the two-sided fwer level of  <dig> , but rather the power at the inflated type i error rate as observed in table  <dig>  as such, it is erroneous to conclude that that the -boot method is more powerful.

we evaluated the empirical power and fwer under the simulation model  <dig> and  <dig> for π =  <dig>  the result of π =  <dig> have a similar trend the results of π =  <dig>  and π =  <dig>  under simulation model  <dig> and  <dig>  we also evaluated the different proportions for  <dig> prognostic genes  and  <dig> non-prognostic genes  and  <dig> prognostic genes  and  <dig> non-prognostic genes . these results have a similar trend the result of  <dig> prognostic genes  and  <dig> non-prognostic genes .

case study
in this section, we will summarize the results from applying our proposed method to the caenorhabditis elegans dauer data. wang and kim  <cit>  use cdna microarrays to profile gene expression time-trajectories during the transition from the dauer state to the non-dauer state  and after feeding of starved first laval stage worms . the cdna microarray expressions were measured on m =  <dig>   <dig> genes. for the experimental group, the worms are harvested at  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours after feeding with three to four replicates at each time-point. for the control group, are harvested  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours after feeding withe four replicates at each time-point. for this illustration, we have set the t =  <dig>  time-point in the experimental group to t =  <dig>  this data set is available for download from http://cmgm.stanford.edu/~kimlab/dauer/.

for the case study based on the wang and kim  <cit>  data, the number of significant genes, identified at a given fwer ∈ , the -boot method identifies the largest while the -perm method identifies the smallest number of significant genes. this is reversed for larger fwer levels. the number of significant genes identified by the -perm method is consistently between the numbers identified by the other two methods. the set of significant genes identified by -perm is, however, not a proper subset of genes identified by methods. in other words, the -perm method is identifying potentially novel genes missed by the other two methods.

we provide a venn diagram on the set of of genes identified as significant at the  <dig>  fwer level in figure  <dig>  there are  <dig> significant genes in common among the three methods. the -perm identifies  <dig> genes not identified by the other two methods. we rank these  <dig> genes according to the difference of their respective p-values from the -perm and -perm methods and show the top nine genes according to this ranking in figure  <dig>  as illustrated in the simulation study, the mean model by regression is not robust to the outliers. there are  <dig> genes identified as significant by the -boot method only. the top nine genes, based on the magnitude of the differences of the corresponding  <dig> -boot and -perm fwer p-values, are shown in figure  <dig>  as illustrated in the simulation study, -boot may be severely anti-conservative if the error terms are heterogeneous over time  <cit> . the supplementary material provides the biological properties of  <dig> genes  that are identified only by -perm .

discussion
in these discussions, we have assumed that any difference, including vertical shifts, among the time trajectories, are biologically relevant and of interest. in some applications, one may want to ignore vertical shifts, as these may be often caused by batch effects, and primarily focus on genes for which there are actual differences among the time trends. the procedures we have discussed can be easily modified to accommodate this situation. to this end, for gene , the k sample means for each group are computed. the algorithm is then applied to the centered versions of the observed expressions . although the illustration presented in this paper have been limited to the two-sample case , as shown in the methods section, the method can be extended to the case where k >  <dig>  the method can be easily extended to account for multiplicity by controlling a false-discovery rate . the unadjusted permutation p-value for gene j, based on the notation in the algorithm presented in the methods section, is . fdr adjusted p-values can then be computed based on these unadjusted p-values. we finally note that the method can also be applied in the one-sample cases. in this setting, one is interested in identifying genes whose time-trajectories are time-dependent. the marginal hypotheses are formulated as testing hj : gj = cj for all t >  <dig> versus hj : gj ≠ cj for some t >  <dig> for a constant say cj . as under the null, all of the expressions are exchangeable, the null sampling distribution is generated by permuting all observed expressions for a given gene. the corresponding null residual error is obtained as  where  is the sample mean for the n expressions observed for gene j. for many regressions problems, the target function to be estimated is the mean of the distribution of the outcome conditional on a set of co-variables. in a time-course microarray experiment, this would correspond to the mean of the expression profile over time. in this paper, we have proposed to estimate the conditional quantile, rather than the conditional mean, of the distribution of the outcome variable a as function of time. specifically, we use the special case of the median. consider the standard additive mean regression problem of the form yi = g + ϵi, where g is the conditional mean of y at time t and ϵ is a mean-zero error term. one criterion that is often used to find an estimate of g is to minimize Σi) <dig>  restricting this optimization to the set of linear functions yields the standard least-squares estimate. optimizing over the set of all "smooth" functions yields an estimator that interpolates the observations. as a balancing act between these two extremes, one may consider optimizing the following criterion  

where ∫)2dt is a so called penalty term. the amount of smoothing is determined by the parameter λ ∈ . the estimation procedure used in this paper is based on a similar regularization approach where the terms ) <dig> are replaced by ρ) and the penalty term ∫)2dt is replaced ∫|g''|dt.

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed a robust method for identifying genes whose time trajectories depend on a phenotypic or experimental factor. furthermore, we proposed a multiple testing procedure to adjust for multiplicity. our method is based on regression type estimator. through an extensive simulation study, we observed our method accurately control the fwer and the mean model by regression is not robust to the outliers.
