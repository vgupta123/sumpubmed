BACKGROUND
rice blast disease is a serious and recurrent problem in all rice-growing regions of the world. it is estimated that every year the rice destroyed by the disease could feed  <dig> million people  <cit> . the disease is caused by the fungus magnaporthe oryzae, which is the teleomorph of a complex genus of ascomycete fungi composed of interfertile anamorphs  <cit> . the fungus is highly adaptive to its host and is capable of causing infection at any growing stage. the diversity of the pathogen and the complexity of the disease make it to be a formidable challenge for fully solving the problem  <cit> .

the use of resistance  genes in crop breeding programs has been, and will undoubtedly remain the major means for disease control. in rice, about  <dig> r genes have been isolated to the disease caused by a pathogen infection . based on the conserved motifs , leucine-rich repeat , toll-interleukin receptor , coiled-coil , transmembrance receptor , protein kinase ), r genes were classified into four kinds, referring to nbs-lrr, rlk, lrr-tm, tm-cc  <cit> . more than  <dig> loci, involved in rice blast resistance, referring to  <dig> major blast resistance genes, have been identified, and at least  <dig> resistance genes have been cloned . blast resistance is generally classified into complete and partial resistance  <cit> . complete resistance to blast, controlled by a major gene, is qualitative and race specific, involving genes such as pib  <cit> , pita  <cit> , and pi <dig>  <cit> . partial resistance to blast, on other hand, is considered to be quantitative and durable because of its generally non-race-specific and polygenic characteristics. many partial resistant locus have been identified, such as pi- <dig>  <cit> . a rice plant cannot be resistant to an isolate of magnaporthe oryzae unless the pathogen has the genes that make it avirulent on that rice plant. an isolate of magnaporthe oryzae cannot be avirulent on a rice plant unless the rice plant has genes that make it resistant to that isolate  <cit> . hence, cultivating rice varieties with highly efficient, durable resistance to blast is still the most economically feasible and environmentally sound management approach in most blast-prone rice ecosystems.

the qtl approach, specific to the genetic population, is not suitable to identify the tremendous phenotypic variation within the scope of the whole genome  <cit> . the genome-wide association study  has emerged as a powerful approach for simultaneously screening genetic variation underlying complex phenotype. in  <dig>  gwas was first applied to a human disease, age-related macular degeneration  <cit> . subsequently, a series of gwas research have been published  <cit> . however, gwas applied to the dissection of complex traits in animals and plants are only just beginning because of the lack of effective genotyping techniques and the limited resources for developing high-density haplotype maps. for both qtl approach and gwas, genetic transformation is generally required to identify the candidate gene.

in rice, increasing amounts of genomic resources have been created in terms of genome sequences  <cit>  and high-density snp maps  <cit> . huang et al. <cit>  used illumina next-generation sequencing of abundant rice landraces worldwide to generate low-coverage sequence data across the lines and construct a comprehensive hapmap for rice  that could be used for gwas for agronomic traits. in our study, we extensively examined blast resistance in a genome-wide association study  based on genotyping  <dig>  snps variants across  <dig> indica diverse accessions  <cit> . the goal of this study was, using gwas, to identify a substantial number of loci related to blast resistance that could be important for rice production and improvement.

RESULTS
phenotypic variation
we investigated the concentrations of  <dig> strains of rice blast on seedlings, and evaluated resistance to rice blast by dla on each experimental plot. the correlation coefficient indicated that dla by blast strains ch <dig>  ch <dig> and ch <dig> was significantly associated with latitude  while dla by ch <dig> was associated with longitude  . based on the sharedallele distance  <cit>  using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean   <cit> , the set of strains could be divided into two groups: one group only consisted of the strains ch <dig>  ch <dig>  ch <dig> and ch <dig>  which have the weaker pathogenicity, and the other comprised the remaining  <dig> strains, which have the stronger pathogenicity .

gwas for resistance to  <dig> blast strains
to investigate the genotypic variation underlying resistance to rice blast, gwas was carried out to identify the associated loci in indica rice landraces, using the emmax algorithm  <cit> . we identified a total of  <dig> associated loci using p = <dig>  × 10− <dig> as the genome-wide significance thresholds . 50% of the detected strains  had at least one significant association, with an average of  <dig>  associations per strains. the ch <dig> strain had most with eight associations, followed by ch <dig> with seven, while ch <dig>  ch <dig> and ch <dig> only had one. genome-wide analysis of the associated loci existed random distribution across the  <dig> chromosomes. of these loci, most seven were separately distributed on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig>  while none were on chromosome  <dig>  the chromosome distributions of the associated loci are presented in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  possessing similar trends with the distributions of the known loci. furthermore, gwas hot spots were located on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  which was consistent with the reported research  <cit> . and the same/nearby snps were significantly associated with multiple traits. for example, snps at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> were associated with ch <dig> and ch <dig>  snps at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> with ch <dig> and ch <dig>  this illustrated that these strains might have common mechanisms and be caused by pleiotropic or closely linked genes. the significant loci detected are also illustrated, corresponding to disease resistance protein, nbs-lrr protein, kinase-like domain containing protein, heavy metal transport/detoxification protein and other known and unknown proteins .figure  <dig>

assessment of gwas findings and function identification of candidate genes
searching the flanking regions of the associated loci, four were located close to or even landed on two known cloned genes , and one qtl , identified previously using near isogenic lines or recombinant inbred lines with map-based cloning, which illustrated the relatively high resolution of our gwas. we forecasted candidate genes through searching a protein that contained the conserved motifs of r gene. to further verify the association possibility, we validated some of candidate genes by quantitative real-time pcr   and their expression profiles in public databases.

r genes play vital part in the detection of invading pathogens, and in the activation of defense mechanisms  <cit> , among which nbs-lrr-type r genes have been the most extensively studied research targets in plant genetics. the strongest association result , explaining up to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance, was around the gene os11g <dig> , which is one of the rice pia-blast resistance gene and encodes nbs-lrr type protein from a region on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the expression of os11g <dig>  in the resistant landrace was higher than that in the susceptible landrace. after inoculation, the resistance level in the resistant landrace increased, while it has no change in the susceptible landrace. the expression profiles from microarray data  indicated that the os11g <dig> gene has a high expression level in young leaf, mature leaf and seeding root.figure  <dig>

we observed additional signals located ±13 kb and  <dig>  kb downstream of the pif, a rice blast disease qtl identified by a previous study  <cit>  and mapped on chromosome  <dig>  these snps were associated with ch <dig>  and ch <dig> , respectively explaining  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. os11g <dig> is described as a disease resistance protein containing nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat  domain, suggesting that os11g <dig> is the largest extent candidate gene for pif. as shown in qpcr , the expression of os11g <dig> was similar to that of os11g <dig>  the expression profiles from microarray data  showed that the gene was constitutively expressed at a low level. thus, we speculated that the disease resistance protein os11g <dig> might be the large extent candidate gene for pif.figure  <dig>

members of the kinase protein family also participate in r gene-mediated disease resistance, such as the reported genes pto   <cit> , xa <dig>   <cit> , and rpg <dig>   <cit> . a significant snp  associated with ch <dig> for a cluster of six genes , explaining  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. according to gene ontology  analysis, os12g <dig> and os12g <dig> were described as kinase-like domain containing protein and identified as the priori candidate genes underlying this locus. for os12g <dig>  the result of qpcr  was also similar to os11g <dig>  and the expression profiles from microarray data  indicated that os12g <dig> has a low expression level, with a peak during inflorescence p <dig> . for os12g <dig>  the expression level decreased after inoculation  and it has a low expression level in most tissues and organs , similar to os11g <dig>  therefore, we speculated that the two genes might be required for the full function of this locus. this is similar to the situations in rice pikm  <cit> , pi <dig>  <cit> , and arabidopsis rrs <dig> and rps <dig>  <cit> , which demonstrated that the exact same phenotype of complete disease resistance can be the result of different loci.figure  <dig>

to evaluate whether novel functional loci were implicated by gwas, we further explore significant snp, chr12_ <dig> , on chromosome  <dig>  this snp was significantly associated with the strain ch <dig> , and explained up to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. searching the flanking region, ten candidate genes were involved, referring to zinc finger protein, histone h <dig>  putative plant transposon protein and so on . our qpcr analysis  demonstrated that os12g <dig>  os12g <dig>  and os12g <dig> might be the most promising candidate genes participated positive regulations for this region. os12g <dig>  and os12g <dig>  had a higher expression levels in the resistant landraces compared with those in the susceptible landraces, and no difference between before and after inoculation. unlike them, the expression level of os12g <dig>  increased after inoculation. in addition, the microarray data showed that os12g <dig>  were constitutively expressed at a low level, os12g <dig>  had a high expression level during the inflorescence p <dig>  and weak expression levels in other tissues and organs at various development stages. there were no probes in the microarray for os12g <dig>  for others, they might be no role in the regulation of blast resistance or as negative regulation .figure  <dig>

of the other snps reaching genome-wide significance, chr11_ <dig>  was ±37 kb upstream of the known cloned gene, pik, which is also composed of two adjacent nbs-lrr genes and confers high and stable resistance to many chinese rice blast isolates  <cit> . more interesting, we discovered a signal  associated on chromosome  <dig>  where there is no relative blast resistance loci reported. searching the flanking region , os03g <dig> encodes kinase-like domain containing protein, and os03g <dig> encodes heavy metal transport/detoxification protein domain containing protein, and so on. though it is unclear what gene participate the resistance regulation, the region would be further investigated.

discussion
in this work, gwas was used for association mapping of quantitative disease resistance genes to rice blast disease, which is similar to work performed in maize  <cit> . the use of high-density genome-wide snps in gwas not only allows the discovery of true candidate genes, but also enables a comprehensive view of the regulatory mechanism of the traits.

although genome-wide association studies are becoming more and more feasible, it seems likely that population structure will still be subject to considerable debate, which may result in an increase rate of the false-positives  <cit> . however, the extent of the problem not only depends on the extent to that the sample is structured, but also on the phenotype  <cit> . a trait that is strongly affected by population structure will display a higher false-positive rate  <cit> . in order to be less prone to false-positives resulted from genetic structure, our study only used the indica panel and optimized all of the parameters in the emmax algorithm. in fact, although the emmax algorithm, or mixed line model  <cit> , reduced the inflation of the p-value, it could often mask the true loci and decrease the detection power  <cit> . in this context, most association mapping of human studies are likely to be case–control studies, given a judiciously chosen control  <cit> .

despite these limitations, we identified  <dig> loci associated with rice blast disease resistance in the indica panel, with one located on chromosome  <dig>  it is no doubt that there is pseudo information in the data, and not practical to thoroughly predict the false association from true. to analyze the candidate genes, we combined gene annotation, qpcr and expression profile from microarray data to investigate the potential functional polymorphisms capable of causing changes in the phenotype. of these associated loci, some were overlapped or coincided with previously identified genes and qtls  <cit> . if the range was extended to 300 kb , more known genes might have been detected, such as pita  <cit> . in addition, we detected newly associated loci that were characterized by the presence of r genes. furthermore, it is worth noting that the strongest association did not always correspond to the candidate genes, which might reflect an ascertainment bias  <cit> , and these genes may be more interesting because of their participation in metabolic regulation  <cit> . the results demonstrated that rice blast disease resistance was conditioned by a range of mechanisms  <cit> , and that there is considerable mechanistic overlap with basal resistance  <cit> .

chromosomal hotspots are frequently found for rice blast disease, and chromosome  <dig>  as previously reported, had the most associated loci:  <dig> loci referring to  <dig> major blast resistance genes . in this study, associated loci and candidate genes were also frequently found on chromosome  <dig>  yu et al.  <cit>  discovered that the highest frequency of copy number variations  for rice was on chromosome  <dig>  and genes in many cnvs were involved in resistance. most of these encode proteins with conserved nucleotide-binding sites  and leucine-rich repeats . meanwhile, nbs-lrr genes in plants are inclined to cluster at the adjacent loci within genomes  <cit> . we also analyzed a cluster of candidate genes that cooperatively participated in functional regulation of blast disease resistance, or had a direct role in regulation , as observed in the a previous study  <cit> . the explanation to the hotspots might be the occurrence of biochemical connections or that they are highly related with the original rice genome, pointing to the same genomic position.

we found that several snps were associated with the same strain. and this might be multigenic effect and attributed to the accumulation of numerous loci, influenced by epistatic effect and additive effect. in addition, some strains showed a significant association in the same region, indicating that these strains had similar genetic control, moreover, illustrating that these strains might have common mechanism and be caused by pleiotropic or closely linked genes  <cit> . this result was in line with classification according to the phenotype data. these correlations indicated that the mutation in this identified region was an important control point for blast disease and should be considered as a quantitative partial resistant to blast because of its generally non-race specificity. otherwise, the different p values of these correlations demonstrated that the loci may reflect unequal disease resistance for the various strains.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of high-density genome-wide snps in gwas not only allows the discovery of true candidate genes, but also enables a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanism of the traits. our results further confirmed that gwas is a powerful complementary approach for dissecting the quantitative disease resistant genes to traditional qtl mapping. this work provides the basis of further study of the potential function of these candidate genes. a subset of true associations would be weakly associated with outcome in any given gwas; therefore, large-scale replication is necessary to confirm our results. future research will focus on validating the effects of these candidate genes and their functional variants using genetic transformation and transferred dna insertion mutant screens, to verify that these genes engender resistance to blast disease in rice.
