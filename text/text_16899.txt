BACKGROUND
cd <dig> is a 50-kda transmembrane protein that belongs to the tnf receptor family. it is not only expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as b cells, dendritic cells and macrophages, but is also found on endothelial cells, mast cells, fibroblast cells, tumor cells and smooth muscle cells, suggesting that it has extensive functions in different physiological contexts .

there are many downstream signaling pathways coupled to the cd <dig> intracellular region, such as jak3-stat <dig>  traf6-erk, p <dig>  jnk, and nf-κb signaling pathway  <cit> . upon binding to cd <dig> ligand cd <dig> leads to nf-κb <dig> p <dig> processing into p <dig> and activates non-canonical nf-κb signaling, this is likely to be important for the transcriptional regulation of cd <dig> target genes in adaptive immune responses  <cit> .

during the activation of immune responses, both tcr-mhc antigen signaling and co-stimulatory signals such as b7-cd <dig> are required for antigen-presenting cells to activate t cells. activated t cells express high level of cd <dig> ligand that interacts with cd <dig> on antigen-presenting cells. in turn cd40-activated non-canonical nf-κb signaling up-regulates b <dig> expression on antigen-presenting cells, thus promoting antigen presentation . in addition to the antigen-presenting process, cd40-activated signals are also involved in the priming of t cells  <cit> , the cytotoxicity of t cells  <cit> , the proliferation and differentiation of b cells, and immunoglobulin class switching and so on  <cit> . although it participates in physiological processes, many studies have been published on its role in the pathology of disease. activation of cd <dig> signaling is present in type  <dig> diabetes, multiple sclerosis , inflammatory bowel disease , psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus   <cit> . disrupting the pathway has shown significant effects on the treatment of most of these diseases in mouse models   <cit> . several cd40l-cd <dig> interaction-blocking antibodies such as bg <dig>  idec- <dig> and ch5d <dig> have gone through or are undergoing clinical trials, and some have shown curative effects. thus, the cd <dig> signaling pathway is considered to be a promising target for the clinical treatment of autoimmune diseases .

in this study, we aimed to disrupt the cd40l-cd <dig> interaction by expressing the extracellular domain of cd <dig>  cd40-n, a  <dig> amino acids soluble form of the extracellular domain of cd <dig>  was designed. a methylotrophic yeast called pichia pastoris was used in this study as an efficient protein expression system to produce large amounts  of heterologous protein  <cit> . the induced protein was secreted into the culture supernatant and purified by size-exclusion chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. finally, purified cd40-n was obtained with a purity of more than 90 %. the purified protein was able to block the cd <dig> activated signaling in vitro and to decrease the symptom of dss-induced colitis in vivo. thus, the purified cd40-n protein may be useful for further functional and structural studies.

yeast nitrogen base  was obtained from sigma. other reagents were of analytical purity. sephadex g- <dig>  and q-sepharose-ff were purchased from ge healthcare.

construction of expression vector ppic9k/cd40-n
cd40-n is the region from 61 bp to 579 bp in cd <dig> , encoding amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  a codon-optimized version of cd40-n was synthesized with xhoi and noti sites at either end and cloned into the puc <dig> plasmid by sangon biotech. the plasmid was digested with xhoi and noti  to release the cd40-n sequence. the sequence was then inserted into the yeast expression vector ppic9k using the same restriction sites. the ligation product was transformed into e. coli dh5α competent cells. successful recombinant colonies with ppic9k/cd40-n were confirmed by restriction digest with xhoi and noti and sequencing. small-scale plasmid preparations, restriction digests, ligations and transformations were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

transformation of p. pastoris to produce a cd40-n-expressing strain
the constructed plasmid ppic9k/cd40-n was linearized with sali. the digested product was purified using an easypure pcr purification kit  and used to transform the yeast host strain gs <dig>  the transformation was carried out by electroporating p. pastoris as described in the pichia expression manual . briefly, the gs <dig> cells were cultured in ypd medium until the od <dig> reached  <dig> – <dig> . then, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. competent cells were generated by washing the cells twice with ice–cold water and followed by washing twice with ice-cold d-sorbitol buffer . finally, the competent cells were resuspended in 1 ml of d-sorbitol buffer mixed with linearized plasmid in an electroporation cuvette on ice before electroporation . transformed cells were supplied with 1 ml ice-cold d-sorbitol immediately after electroporation and cultured at 30 °c for 1 h. the transformants were plated on md plates  for 2– <dig> days.

approximately  <dig> colonies on the md plate were selected and screened for g <dig>  resistance. first, colonies were synchronized twice by culturing in 200 μl ypd medium in a 96-well plate for 24 h. then, colonies were screened in media containing 1 mg/ml g <dig> for 24 h. positive colonies  were cultured in a new plate with medium containing a higher concentration of g <dig>  for 24 h. this procedure was repeated until the strain could not grow on the plate. strains that could grow at the highest concentration of g <dig> were stored at −80 °c for further experiments.

to induce the expression of cd40-n, each clone was streaked onto an ypd plate to obtain single colony. the single colony was then inoculated in 50 ml of bmgy in 250 ml flasks and cultured at  <dig> °c with 220 rpm shaking. when the od <dig> reached 3– <dig>  cells were harvested by centrifugation and briefly rinsed with water to remove trace glycerol. rinsed cells were centrifuged and re-suspended in 50 ml bmmy. the cells were cultured in a new 250-ml flask at  <dig> °c with 220 rpm shaking and supplemented with methanol to a final concentration of 1 % every 24 h. 80 μl supernatant sample was collected every 24 h to examine the expression of cd40-n by sds-page and western blotting.

large-scale production of cd40-n
large-scale production of cd40-n was carried out using the clone that had the best yield in the small-scale experiments. a single colony was selected and grown in 5 ml of ypd medium at  <dig> °c with 220 rpm shaking overnight. the overnight culture was diluted  into 200 ml ypd medium and grown at  <dig> °c, 220 rpm shaking until an od <dig> of  <dig>  was reached. the culture was transferred into 3 l of medium in a bioreactor  and grown in batch mode for 20 h. a sharp increase in dissolved oxygen  occurred when the od <dig> reached  <dig>  suggesting that the glycerol was exhausted. glycerol  was fed at a rate of 20 ml/ until the od <dig> reached  <dig>  the methanol-fed phase began once all of the glycerol was consumed. the methanol feed rate gradually increased from  <dig>  to 4 ml/ in the first 6 h, allowing the culture to adapt to methanol consumption. after 6 h, the methanol feed rate was maintained at 4 ml/l.h for an additional 30 h.

the fermentation medium  contained  <dig>  g sodium citrate•2h <dig>   <dig>  g caso4•2h <dig>  18 g k2so <dig>   <dig>  g mgso <dig>   <dig>  g koh, 27 ml 85 % h3po <dig>  32 ml glycerin and 2 ml ptm <dig> solution. a ptm <dig> solution was added to the fermentation medium with 2 ml/l. the ptm <dig>  solution contained 6 g cuso4•5h2o, 3 g mnso4•h2o,  <dig>  g h3bo <dig>  20 g zncl <dig>   <dig>  g ki,  <dig>  g namoo4•2h2o,  <dig>  g cocl2•6h2o,  <dig>  g feso4•7h2o, 10 ml h2so <dig>   <dig>  g caso4•2h2o,  <dig>  g mgso <dig>  and  <dig>  g biotin, and the solution was sterilized with a  <dig>  μm filter .

RESULTS
construction, expression, and detection of cd40-n
the dna fragment encoding the partial human cd <dig> gene , cd40-n, underwent codon optimization according to yeast’s preference and was inserted between the xhoi and noti sites of the expression vector ppic9k. the correct sequence of the recombinant was confirmed by dna sequencing.

transformation of p. pastoris with ppic9k yielded  <dig> transformants that were able to grow in the presence of a high concentration of geneticin, including three strains that grew in 4 mg/ml geneticin on ypd plates and one strain that grew in 1 mg/ml geneticin. after methanol induction, the supernatants were harvested and analyzed by coomassie blue staining and western blotting. coomassie blue staining detected an increasing band at approximately 27 kda that peaked at 96 h, suggesting that cd40-n may be secreted into the culture medium . western blots were performed after cd40-specific antibody  was checked. a human cd40-n  gene fragment was cloned into pcdna <dig>  plasmid with a flag tag at the c-terminus. the constructs were transferred to hek293t cells and expressed for the western blot assay. the cd <dig> antibody detected the same band with the flag antibody, demonstrating the specificity of the antibody . the antibody was used to detect the culture medium, and western blotting results showed that the potential cd40-n band in coomassie blue staining was specifically recognized by the cd40-specific antibody, indicating that the protein expressed by p. pastoris was recombinant cd40-n . comparing the band intensities of different clones by coomassie blue staining and western blot analysis showed that clone number  <dig> had the highest expression level of cd40-n.fig.  <dig> sds–page and western blot analysis of recombinant cd40-n expressed in p. pastoris. a a 20-μl sample of supernatant was loaded onto a 12 % sds–page gel and stained with coomassie brilliant blue g- <dig>  all of the sds-page experiments were performed under the same conditions. samples were collected at 12-h intervals for 84 h. the sizes of molecular weight markers  are shown , and recombinant cd40-n protein is indicated with an arrow. b western blot analysis of human flag-tagged cd40-n  and cd40-n-s  expressed in hek293t cells. pcdna <dig> -cd40-n and pcdna <dig> -cd40-n-s were introduced into hek293t cells, and the cell lysates were harvested after 48 h. a 10-μl sample was loaded onto a 12 % sds–page gel. anti-flag, anti-cd40-n and anti-gapdh antibodies were used to detect the proteins. c western blot analysis of proteins at different times in p. pastoris . p indicates the positive control

to study whether g28- <dig>  a cd <dig> agonist antibody, can bind cd40-n directly. we use itc <dig> system to analysis the interaction  <cit> . the process was performed according to the method. after saturating the macromolecule, the residue heat effects are due to mechanical and dilution effects . after the integration of the area of each peak, the individual heats are plotted against the molar ratio from which through nonlinear regression , the thermodynamic parameters was calculated, kd = <dig>  μmol, and △h =− <dig> kj/mol.fig.  <dig> itc assay reveals the interaction of cd40-n with cd40-specific antibody, g28- <dig>  a the heat effects of cd40-n and g28-5; b after integration of area under each peak , the thermodynamic parameters was calculated using nonlinear regression analysis



cd40-n can disrupt cd40-activated signaling
the recognition of cd <dig> by cd <dig> ligand or cd40-spcific agonist antibody results in nfκb p <dig> processing into nfκb p <dig>  activates alternative nfκb signaling and induces downstream target gene expression. to determine whether the purified protein cd40-n can disrupt the interaction of cd <dig> with cd40l or cd40-specific agonist antibody, we treated bjab cells with cd40l in the presence of titrated cd40n. western blot showed that cd40-n reduced the p <dig> processing into p <dig> induced by cd40l in bjab cells in a dose-dependent manner . g28- <dig> can activate cd <dig> signaling and further induce the expression of downstream target genes such as tnf-alpha. we observed that cd40-n significantly reduced tnf-alpha mrna level induced by cd40-specific agonist antibody, g28- <dig>  in a dose dependent manner , while the rna levels of bcl-xl was not induced by g28- <dig> as negative control. these data demonstrate that the purified protein cd40-n could disrupt the interaction of cd <dig> with cd40l or cd40-specific agonist antibody in vitro.fig.  <dig> cd40-n disrupts the interaction of cd <dig> and cd40l or cd40-specific agonist antibody in vitro.

functional cd40-n can relieve the symptoms of dss-induced colitis
cd <dig> signaling has been shown to play an important role in inflammations such as colitis . to determine whether cd40-n functions in vivo, we employed a dss-induced colitis mouse model to test it. at 7-day post-treatment, the mean body weight of the pbs treated mice was reduced to  <dig>  % of the starting weight; while the cd40-n treatment could significantly recover the loss of body weight . h&e staining indicated that damage to the architecture of the colon in cd40-n treatment mice was reduced compared to that of the control mice, and crypt atrophy and cilia damage were both less prevalent . these data reveal that cd40-n reduced inflammation in vivo to alleviate the symptoms of dss-induced colitis in mice.fig.  <dig> cd40-n administration reduces the symptom of dss-induced colitis. a wild-type c57bl/c mice were injected on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with either pbs or 200 μg of cd40-n and were given  <dig>  % dss. body weight loss was recorded every day. the data represent the mean ± sem . student’s t-test was performed for statistical analysis. **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> . b h&e staining of colon sections of mice at 7 day. the three pictures in the upper panel come from  <dig> dss-treated mice with pbs treatment. the pictures in the lower panel show  <dig> dss-treated mice with cd40-n treatment 



discussion
targeting cd40l-cd <dig> interaction could be useful in clinical applications for curing autoimmune diseases, providing treatment following transplantation and treating tumors  <cit> . one strategy to disrupt this interaction is to use an anti-cd40l monoclonal antibody: this approach has been shown to be effective in mouse models of ra, sle, ms, ibd, t <dig> diabetes, and inflammatory heart disease  <cit> . the humanized cd40l monoclonal antibody bg <dig>  has shown therapeutic effects on sle patients in clinical trials  <cit> . another humanized monoclonal antibody, idec- <dig>  was tested in a phase ii clinical study in itp patients  <cit> . however, they were not approved for clinical use because of thrombotic complications when bg <dig> was used in some sle patients and idec- <dig> was used in treating crohn’s disease  <cit> . a third humanized anti-cd40l antibody, abi <dig>  targeted a different epitope and was found to have the same thrombotic complications, suggesting that these complications are a common effect of anti-cd40l antibodies regardless of epitope specificity. recently, researchers have found that the interaction of the fc fragment of the anti-cd40l antibody with the fc receptor cd <dig> in platelets may cause platelet cross-linking and lead to clotting  <cit> . this is consistent with the fact that thrombus formation was not observed in mouse models because mouse platelets do not express a homolog of cd <dig>  reconstruction of the fc fragment of the antibody had been shown to eliminate the complications while maintaining the therapeutic effects of the anti-cd40l antibody in sle and ms mouse models  <cit> . the transformed isotype of high-affinity fragment fab’ and f’ <dig> has also been studied. all of these methods provide new insights into the effects of disrupting cd40l-cd <dig> interaction using a cd40l antibody.

another strategy to disrupt this interaction is to target cd <dig>  some cd <dig> antibodies have been tested. hcd <dig>  an antibody that can disrupt cd40l-cd <dig> interaction but cannot activate cd <dig> signaling, has been used in a clinical trial to treat cd40+ multiple myeloma because of its adcc function  <cit> . another antibody, ch5d <dig>  has shown some curative effect in a phase ii clinical study for the treatment of crohn’s disease  <cit> .

targeting the cd40l-cd <dig> interaction is an important method of immunotherapy for cancer treatment. dacetuzumab  has been used in clinical trials for treating cll, mm and nhl  <cit> .

given the importance of the pathway activated by cd <dig> in research and its clinical applications, we constructed a cd40-n expression system in p. pastoris. p. pastoris was chosen because of its high production yield, expression stability, ability to secrete proteins, moderate post-translational modifications, and simple economical culture conditions. additionally, this expression system has been used to prepare many recombinant proteins for research and clinical applications  <cit> .

recombinant cd40-n was purified from the culture medium by a combination of sephadex g- <dig> size-exclusion and q ff–sepharose ion exchange chromatography. the purity of the final recombinant cd40-n exceeded 90 %. itc assay verified the interaction of cd40-n with cd40-specific antibody. the purified cd40-n showed biologically activity based on its ability to reduce cd40l-activated non-canonical nf-κb signaling pathway and inhibit tnf-alpha expression induced by cd40-specific agonist antibody in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. importantly, cd40-n protein could significantly decrease the inflammation in dss-induced colitis mouse model. these data reveal that we have established a reliable method for the expression and purification of cd40-n, which is functional in vitro and in vivo in interrupting the interaction of cd <dig> and cd40l.

because cd <dig> is a glycoprotein, glycosylation may play a critical role in its structure and function. we showed that our recombinant cd40-n was glycosylated with n-linked sugars, which was responsible for the increased molecular weight observed by sds-page . the predicted potential n-linked glycosylation sites of cd40-n are asn <dig> and asn <dig>  and the exact n-linked sugars sites remain to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
this work has successfully generated cd40-n recombinant protein in pichia pastoris that can disrupt the cd40l-cd <dig> interaction. it may serve as a foundation for further scientific and clinical research. the protein fragment we have acquired has potential to be used in research or even treating inflammation diseases such as colitis.
