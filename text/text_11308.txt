BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus  is a nonenveloped, single-stranded, dna virus with a circular genome of approximately  <dig>  kb, belonging to the family circoviridae. porcine circovirus type  <dig>  was first isolated as a non-pathogenic contaminant virus in a porcine kidney cell line  <cit> , whereas porcine circovirus type  <dig>  is recognized as a causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome   <cit> , a multifactorial swine disease first identified in canada in  <dig>  <cit> . pcv <dig> has since been reported in most pig-producing countries worldwide, including china . the pcv <dig> genome contains three major open reading frames : orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig> . orf <dig> encodes the  <dig> -kda rep proteins, which are essential for viral dna replication  <cit> ; orf <dig> encodes the 30-kda structural capsid protein involved in the host immune response  <cit> ; and the orf <dig> protein is involved in pcv2-induced host cell apoptosis  <cit> .

porcine circovirus-like virus p <dig> was recently identified and has the smallest genome of all dna viruses , which is highly homologous to that of pcv <dig>  like the pcvs, p <dig> has a single-stranded circular dna genome. p <dig> is thought to be a recombinant virus formed between pcv <dig> and another virus  <cit> , and it similarly contains three major orfs: orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  recently, we reported that orf <dig> of p <dig> encodes a major structural protein of approximately  <dig>  kda. this protein reacts strongly with serum from p1-infected swine, suggesting its possible utility in diagnostic assays  <cit> . a comparison of the deduced n-terminal amino acid sequence of p <dig> orf <dig> revealed that it has a high homology with the n-terminal domain of pcv <dig> orf <dig>  however, they only share a low amino acid sequence homology in the c-terminal region because there has been a frameshift in the p <dig> orf <dig> 

epidemiological studies have confirmed that the p <dig> virus is endemic on pig farms in china  <cit> . in vivo studies have shown that p <dig> infects pigs and the infected animals show the clinical signs of pmws  <cit> .

to determine the prevalence of p <dig> infection and to clarify how pmws develops, specific tools for antibody detection are essential. testing for p <dig> antibodies in sera is currently performed with indirect immunofluorescence assays  or immunoperoxidase monolayer assays   <cit> . however, these assays are very time-consuming, whereas enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  can be automated and are more convenient. notably, two antigenic epitopes of the p <dig> capsid  protein have been identified at amino acid residues 6– <dig> and 80– <dig>  a peptide antibody derived from the immunorelevant 6– <dig> epitope was used in our previous investigations  <cit> . however, the resulting test was not specific for p <dig> because there is a slight amount of antigenic cross-reactivity between pcv <dig> and p <dig>  a  <dig> report demonstrated that a peptide antibody test using the 80– <dig> epitope was highly specific for p <dig>  therefore, we used this epitope to establish methods for the specific serological detection of p <dig>  <cit> . a recombinant c-terminally truncated capsid protein  of p <dig>  expressed in an escherichia coli system, was used as an antigen to develop an indirect elisa.

the objectives of the present study were to establish and validate a diagnostic indirect elisa for the serological detection of anti–p <dig> serum antibodies.

ethics statement
this study was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments of the institute of veterinary medicine, jiangsu academy of agricultural sciences  .

expression, purification, and identification of the rctcap protein
to construct a plasmid expressing rctcap, genomic dna was obtained from p1-infected porcine kidney epithelial  cells and used as the template for polymerase chain reaction . to obtain the target gene, orf <dig> without the n-terminal 216-nucleotides , three pairs of primers  were designed according to the published genome sequence of p <dig> strain jsnj .table  <dig> sequences of primers used for the pcrs



the pcr product generated using the a <dig> and a <dig> primer pair was doubly digested with ncoi and ecori and cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pet-28a  . the resulting recombinant expression plasmid, pet28a-mono-orf <dig> was ligated to the pcr product generated with the b <dig> and b <dig> primer pair and doubly digested with ecori and saci. the pcr product generated using the c <dig> and c <dig> primer pair was then digested with the saci and hindiii endonucleases and transferred into the above construct, resulting in the recombinant expression plasmid, pet28a-bi-orf <dig>  the pet28a-tri-orf <dig> plasmid was then constructed similarly and used to transform competent e. coli dh5α cells . clones containing the recombinant plasmid were identified with restriction enzyme digestion and dna sequencing .fig.  <dig> construction of the rctcap expression plasmid. a schematic diagram showing the construction of the rctcap expression plasmid used in this study. the fragments of identical sequence are marked in red



the rctcap plasmid has three tandem repeats, each encoding  <dig> amino acids. the three central repeats are identical except for a few linker amino acids.

to express the cloned gene, competent e. coli bl21- cells  were transformed with pet28a-tri-orf <dig>  alternately, these cells were transformed with plasmid pet-28a  as a control. single-positive clones of the transformed cells were grown in luria-bertani medium containing 80 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °c  to an optical density at 600 nm  of about  <dig> – <dig> . protein expressin was induced in these cells by the addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactoside  to a final concentration of 1 mm for 6–8 h at 37 °c. the bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline , and then lysed with sonication on ice. the sonicated cells were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 30 min at 4 °c and the precipitate was resuspended and purified by ni2+-nta agarose , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the eluates containing the rctcap protein were pooled and dialyzed against  <dig>  m pbs . the purified proteins were analyzed with sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. the membrane was blocked with blocking buffer  overnight at 4 °c and then incubated with rabbit anti-p <dig> antibody  raised against the synthetic peptide cspnpspttpvtsh. horseradish peroxidase -conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg antibody   was used as the secondary antibody. immunoreactivity was visualized with diaminobenzidine .

the concentration of the purified rctcap protein was determined with the bradford method using bovine serum albumin  as the standard, and the purified rctcap protein was stored at −70 °c until use in later assays.

elisa procedure
high-binding 96-well microtiter plates  were coated with 100 μl of rctcap protein in  <dig>  m bicarbonate/carbonate buffer  overnight at 4 °c. after three washes in pbs  containing  <dig>  % tween  <dig> , the plates were blocked with 1 % bsa for 1 h at 37 °c. serum samples were diluted in pbs  containing 5 % dry milk, 100 μl of the diluted samples were added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for  <dig>  h at 37 °c. the plates were then washed five times with pbs-t and incubated for 45 min at 37 °c with 100 μl of diluted hrp-conjugated goat anti-swine igg antibody . the plates were then washed four times, and the colorimetric reaction was developed with 50 μl of tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate  for 10 min at 37 °c. the color reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m h2so <dig>  and the od <dig> was measured with a microplate reader .

based on the procedure described above, the optimal antigen concentration and serum dilution were determined with a checkerboard serum dilution analysis. in brief, the rctcap protein was serially diluted 2-fold from  <dig>  μg/ml to  <dig>  μg/ml. additionally, p1-positive swine sera and p <dig> seronegative control swine sera were also subjected to a similar serial 2-fold dilution from 1:25−1: <dig> for use in the optimization of the rctcap elisa. after the optimal antigen and antiserum dilutions were established, the hrp-labeled goat anti-swine igg antibody was added to the plate at dilutions of 1: <dig>  1: <dig> , 1: <dig> , and 1: <dig>  to determine the optimal detection antibody dilution for this elisa. the conditions that gave the highest positive control od450/negative control od <dig>  ratio and had an od <dig> value close to  <dig>  for positive serum were considered to be the optimal working conditions.

determination of the negative–positive cut-off
nine hundred swine serum samples were collected sequentially from p1-free pigs that tested negative both for p <dig> antibodies via ifa and for p <dig> nucleic acids via pcr assays. these samples were used to set the negative–positive cut-off value for the rctcap elisa. the mean s/p ratio  and standard deviation  were calculated, and the cut-off value was calculated as x + .

evaluation of assay performance
to evalute the negative–positive cut-off value for this assay,  <dig> serum samples from farm pigs were tested in duplicate with the newly developed rctcap elisa. the diagnostic accuracy of this elisa was determined by calculating the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the test. ifa was used as the reference method to classify the samples as positive or negative. the sensitivity and specificity of the rctcap elisa were determined as follows: sensitivity =  ×  <dig>  and specificity =  ×  <dig>  where tp, fn, tn and fp indicate the true-positive, false-negative, true-negative, and false-positive, respectively.

to detect the specificity of the rctcap elisa, seropositive sera for pcv <dig>  classical swine fever virus , porcine parvovirus , porcine pseudorabies virus , or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  were tested with the rctcap elisa. each sample was tested in triplicate, and the s/p ratios were calculated.

determination of assay reproducibility
to determine the reproducibility of the rctcap elisa, six serum samples from farm pigs  were selected for use in the reproducibility experiments. we ran four replicates of each serum sample on the same plate to assess the intra-assay  reproducibility, and we ran five replicates of each sample on different plates to assess the inter-assay  reproducibility.

the results were used to calculate the mean s/p ratios and coefficients of variation .

ifa
confluent pk <dig> cell monolayers, either untransfected or transfected with an infectious molecular clone of the p <dig> virus, in 96-well plates  were fixed in methanol-acetone for 15 min at −20 °c, and the plate was then washed three times with pbs . serum samples  diluted 1: <dig> in pbst were added to the plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °c. after three washes with pbst, fluorescein-conjugated anti-swine igg antibody , diluted 1: <dig>  was added and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °c. fluorescence was observed with an inverted fluorescence microscope .

serum samples
a serological study was performed to estimate the seroprevalence of p <dig> in the swine population. serum samples  were collected randomly from  <dig> herds with or without pmws in the jiangsu, anhui, shandong, and zhejiang provinces and shanghai municipality, china in 2008– <dig>  the origins of the serum samples were as follows:  <dig> and  <dig> serum samples were from farm a and farm b in jiangsu province, respectively;  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> serum samples were from farm c, farm d, and farm e in anhui province, respectively;  <dig> and  <dig> serum samples were from farm f, and farm g in shandong province, respectively;  <dig> serum samples were from farm h in shanghai municipality; and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> serum samples were from farm i, farm j, and farm k in zhejiang province, respectively. the  <dig> serum samples from farm k in zhejiang province were obtained from different animal growth stages: suckling piglets , nursing pigs , fattening pigs , sows , and breeding boar .

RESULTS
cloning, expression and purification of the rctcap protein
the truncated orf <dig> was amplified with pcr and used with the appropriate primers to construct the recombinant truncated orf <dig> fragment, which is composed of three repeated identical domains. the result was cloned into the pet-28a  vector, from which recombinant proteins were expressed as histidine  fusion proteins. after iptg induction, the recombinant e. coli carrying the pet-28a-tri-orf <dig> cassette expressed a  <dig> -kda protein, which corresponded to the expected size of the rctcap protein . the recombinant protein was expressed as inclusion bodies in e. coli, and its size was confirmed with sds-page. e.coli carrying the recombinant plasmid were lysed with lysozyme  and sonication. the rctcap protein was purified from the lysate by using affinity chromatography. most of the rctcap protein was eluted from a ni2+-nta affinity column. the purified protein was separated with sds-page and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunodetection. the sds-page analysis of the eluted fractions revealed that the protein was purified as a single 15-kda band. the reactivity of the rctcap protein to rabbit anti-p <dig> serum was observed with a western blotting assay . these results confirm that this antigen can be used to detect specific antibodies directed against p <dig> fig.  <dig> identification of the rctcap protein with sds-page and western blotting. m: protein molecular weight marker; 1: iptg-induced cell lysate; 2: rctcap protein purified with a ni2+-nta affinity chromatography column; 3: the purified rctcap protein reacted strongly with rabbit anti-p <dig> polyclonal antibody detected with hrp- conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody as the secondary antibody



optimization of the rctcap elisa
we used checkboard elisas to determine the optimal antigen concentration and the serum sample dilution, which were set at  <dig>  μg/ml and 1: <dig>  respectively, based on the criteria that under these conditions the od <dig> value for positive serum was close to  <dig>  and the p/n value was highest. after these conditions were met, other factors in the rctcap elisa were optimized. we found that 1 % bsa was the best blocking solution for this assay., giving the highest p/n value, compared with the other tested blocking solutions the optimal dilution of the conjugate was 1: <dig>  when the optimal exposure time for the serum samples or detection antibody was investigated, incubation for 90 min or 45 min, respectively, was shown to be best.

reproducibility of the rctcap elisa
the intra-assay and inter-assay reproducibility of the rctcap elisa were determined by comparing the s/p ratios for each farm pig serum sample tested in triplicate. the intra-assay cvs of three serum samples that had been determined as p <dig> seropositive by ifa  in the rctcap elisa ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  %. the inter-assay cvs for ifa-positive serum samples in the rctcap elisa ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  % . the rctcap elisa also showed good repeatability with three pig sera that had been determined as p <dig> seronegative by ifa , as indicated by the low variability among the three replicates of identical samples. these data show that this assay is repeatable, yielding acceptably low levels of variation.table  <dig> repeatability of the rctcap elisa for ifa-positive serum samples of farm pig sera



determination of the negative–positive cut-off
to set a negative–positive cut-off value for the rctcap elisa,  <dig> presumed p <dig> seronegative farm swine sera collected from normal uninfected pigs were examined. the mean ± sd od <dig> value for the normal pig sera in the rctcap elisa was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , which gave a negative–positive cut-off s/p value of approximately  <dig>   for this assay. therefore, serum samples with an od450 >  <dig>  in this assay were regarded as seropositive for p <dig> 

specificity of the rctcap elisa
the specificity of the rctcap elisa was determined by testing the reactivity of  <dig> samples each of ppv, csfv, prv, prrsv, or pcv2-positive sera, which came from the commercial elisa kit. the results show that the mean od <dig> values for the sera, described above were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. therefore, based on our defined negative–positive cut-off value of od450 >  <dig> , none of these antisera was detected as p <dig> seropositive by the rctcap elisa. these findings confirm that the rctcap antigen is specific for antibodies directed against p <dig> 

validation of the rctcap elisa
of the  <dig> swine serum samples described above,  <dig> randomly selected samples were assessed with both the rctcap elisa and ifa. of these, ifa found  <dig> samples as p <dig> seropositive and  <dig> samples as p <dig> seronegative, while evaluation with the rctcap elisa at a cutoff value of  <dig>  found  <dig> samples as p <dig> seropositive and  <dig> samples as p <dig> seronegative. when the samples were judged by both methods,  <dig> were considered p <dig> seropositive and  <dig> were considered p <dig> seronegative. comparatively, five samples assessed as p <dig> seropositive by the rctcap elisa were assessed as p <dig> seronegative by the ifa, and  <dig> samples determined as p <dig> seronegative by the rctcap elisa were assessed as p <dig> seropositive by the ifa . the sensitivity and specificity of the rctcap elisa were  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, based on the assumption that the ifa, considered the gold standard for p <dig> antibody detection, was 100 % accurate. the rate of accordbetween these two methods was  <dig>  %.table  <dig> comparison of the rctcap elisa with ifa for  <dig> farm pig serum samples

discussion
the increasing incidence of pmws on pig farms has become a real threat to the global swine industry. because p <dig> is associated with pmws  <cit> , detecting p <dig> in pig herds is essential for the control of this syndrome. therefore p1-specific diagnostic tools are required to clarify the course of infection. to date, only pcr, ifa, and ipma assay are used to detect p <dig> infection.

ifa is considered to be a sensitive method for detecting p <dig>  but it requires virus-infected cells as well as experienced technicians to examine the stained plates, and it is laborious and time-consuming. therefore, ifa is not suitable for large-scale surveys. the purpose of this study was to develop an indirect elisa to detect antibodies specific for p <dig> 

the n-terminal region of cap contains one potential epitope shared by pcv <dig> and p <dig>  therefore, to avoid complications from antigenic cross-reactivity, we did not use the full-length cap protein in this assay. the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of cap are unique to p <dig> and can be used to differentiate between antibodies directed against pcv <dig> and those directed against p <dig>  however, because the conserved c-terminal region is very small, we constructed a plasmid containing three tandem repeats, each encoding the same  <dig> amino acids. each 42-amino acid repeat was separated by 6 nt of a restriction enzyme recognition site, which created a two amino-acid linker between repeats. the plasmid was also constructed in frame with an n-terminal peptide of six histidines, which allowed the expressed capsid protein to be purified easily with chromatography. a strong specific signal was observed via western blotting, confirming that the truncated protein did not destroy the c-terminal epitope.

we compared the newly developed indirect elisa for detecting p1-specific antibodies with an ifa. the data from the rctcap elisa agreed quite well with the data from the ifa, with a relative sensitivity of  <dig>  % and a specificity of  <dig>  %.

there is high homology between the amino acid sequences of orf <dig> of pcv <dig> and orf <dig> of p <dig>  especially in the n-terminal regions. therefore, to determine the usefulness of the rctcap elisa for p <dig>  we had to evaluate its specificity against pcv <dig>  our results confirm that the rctcap elisa does not react with antibodies directed against pcv <dig>  our data also demonstrate the specificity of this assay, which does not detect antibodies directed against ppv, csfv, prv, or prrsv.

epidemiological studies of p <dig> infections conducted on  <dig> farms in china showed that all of the herds were p <dig> seropositive, except for one, irrespective of the presence or absence of clinical signs of pmws. a high p <dig> seroprevalence was observed in suckling piglets and sows .

CONCLUSIONS
the rctcap elisa described in this study can be used for the detection of antibodies directed against p <dig>  and this assay is highly sensitive, specific, and widely applicable to screening large numbers of serum samples. this report is the first to demonstrate different p <dig> serological profiles of pigs at different stages in herds with or without clinical signs of pmws. however, further serological surveys are required to determine the dynamics of p <dig> infection in herds and the relationship of p <dig> to pmws.
