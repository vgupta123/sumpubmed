BACKGROUND
the cell envelope of gram-negative bacteria consists of two membranes, the inner and outer membrane, which are separated by the periplasm containing a peptidoglycan layer. different transport machineries have evolved for delivering proteins from their site of synthesis in the cytoplasm to the bacterial surface and beyond. one of them is the two-partner secretion  system, which is broadly used in many gram negatives for the specific secretion of usually very large proteins, generically called tpsa  <cit> . after transport across the inner membrane via the sec system, the tpsa protein is translocated across the outer membrane via a dedicated transporter, called tpsb. recognition between the proteins is mediated by a specific n-terminal domain of ~ <dig> amino acid residues in tpsa, the tps domain, which interacts with a periplasmically exposed domain of the outer-membrane-embedded tpsb protein  <cit> .

in several microorganisms, including escherichia coli and neisseria meningitidis, tpsa functions in inhibiting the growth of related bacteria in competition for the same niche in a process called contact-dependent growth inhibition  . in the proposed model  <cit> , the surface-exposed tpsa interacts with a conserved receptor, bama, on a target cell, after which a small c-terminal part of tpsa is proteolytically released and transported into the target cell in a process that also requires the inner-membrane protein acrb  <cit> . an alternative import pathway requires the interaction of the toxin with the f pilus and pilus retraction  <cit> . in the target cell, the toxin, can exert different toxic activities, e.g. as a dnase or an rnase. the gene immediately downstream of tpsa, called tpsi, encodes a small immunity protein that protects the producing cell against the toxic activity of the c-terminal domain of tpsa. on the chromosome, the tpsb, tpsa and tpsi genes are present on genetic islands often additionally containing a number of tpsc cassettes  <cit> . these tpsc cassettes potentially encode n-terminally truncated tpsa proteins, which, however, present an entirely different toxic module at the c terminus. each tpsc cassette is associated with a cognate tpsi gene. because of the n-terminal truncation, these putative tpsc proteins lack the sequences necessary for secretion and it is not sure whether they are expressed. however, the tpsc cassettes can recombine with the tpsa locus, thereby replacing the toxic module present at the c terminus of tpsa  <cit> . thus, tpsa constitutes an interbacterial competition system that can use a broad repertoire of toxic modules.

other secretion systems found in gram-negative bacteria are also meant for inhibiting competing bacteria or even eukaryotic cells. examples include rhsa  of e. coli  <cit>  or the broadly distributed type vi secretion system  <cit> . these growth inhibition systems present similar toxic modules at the c terminus of the exported proteins as found in the tpsa proteins, but show no further sequence similarity with tpsa, consistent with a different secretion mechanism. in the present study, we demonstrate that the mafb proteins of neisseria spp., previously thought to function as adhesins  <cit> , present similar toxic modules at their c terminus as the tpsa proteins, but show no further sequence similarity to tpsa. we demonstrate that these mafb proteins represent a novel growth inhibition system in the meningococcal strain b16b <dig> that functions in interbacterial competition. whilst this manuscript was in preparation, another study of the mafb proteins of neisseria spp. was published  <cit> . for clarity, we have adopted the nomenclature for the maf proteins of that study.

RESULTS
structural organization of meningococcal maf islands
blast searches using different toxic domains of various meningococcal tpsa and tpsc sequences as queries yielded hits with various tpsas and tpscs of different bacterial species. additional hits were also retrieved with the c termini from a large variety of other proteins, including neisserial mafb proteins. mafb proteins are present in different neisseria spp., including n. meningitidis, n. lactamica and n. gonorrhoeae, and they were earlier assigned as members of a multiple adhesin family of proteins thought to be involved in adhesion to host cells  <cit> . the sequence similarity of mafb with tpsas or tpscs is restricted to the c-terminal toxic module, indicating that mafb is not secreted via a tps mechanism. inspection of its genetic context in available genome sequences indicated that the mafb genes are components of genetic islands. the genes in the islands may form an operon composed, from 5’ to 3’ end, of mafa, mafb and a variable number of mafb-related genes, potentially encoding alternative c-terminal domains and designated mafb-ct. these mafb and mafb-ct genes are interspersed with one or more intervenient orfs, which may encode immunity proteins  . up to three independent maf genetic islands, present on different chromosomal locations, can be recognized in meningococcal genomes , designated mgi- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> according to a recent proposal  <cit> . the predicted mafa proteins contain a lipoprotein signal sequence, and phylogenetic analysis of mafa proteins from different strains of various neisseria spp. revealed clustering of the sequences in two phylogenetic groups  with > 95 % of identity within each group and < 70 % identity between groups. mafb proteins contain a predicted n-terminal signal sequence, and the mature part is further structured into three regions: an n-terminal duf <dig> domain of ~ 260– <dig> aa in length, a central region of ~ <dig> aa containing a hint domain, which is usually involved in autocatalytic protein splicing, and a variable c-terminal toxic domain of ~80- <dig> aa. the n-terminal duf <dig> domains of mafb proteins can be clustered in three variants, i, ii and iii, where variants i and ii are phylogenetically more related . the central region is conserved in sequence, but its presence is variable as some mafbs lack the hint domain. the c-terminal region is polymorphic and constitutes an independent toxic domain. the mafb-cts are variable in length . at their 3’ end, they contain sequences that putatively encode a toxic domain, whilst upstream thereof they share sequence similarity with sequences adjacent to the toxic region of mafb genes, including sometimes an intact hint domain. some mafb-cts, for instance nmbg2136_ <dig> of strain g <dig> , encode a venn domain previously recognized as being adjacent to the toxin domain in tpsa proteins  <cit> . the mafb-ct genes generally lack sequences corresponding to the 5´ end of mafb genes, but occasionally, a complete mafb is found among the mafb-ct genes, for example nmo_ <dig> or nmc <dig> in mgi- <dig> of strains alpha <dig> and fam <dig>  respectively . the shared sequences between mafb and mafb-ct genes may be used for genetic rearrangements, resulting in the substitution of the toxic domain at the c terminus of mafb. examination of various neisserial genome sequences suggests that such recombination events have indeed occurred in several cases, since the c-terminal domains of some mafb proteins have > 95 % of sequence similarity with predicted mafb-ct proteins from other genomes. for example, the 3’ end of mafb-ct nmbg2136_ <dig> in mgi- <dig> of g <dig> is placed at the 3’ end of the mafb nmc <dig> in mgi- <dig> of strain fam <dig> . in general, such rearrangements also affect the position of the immediately downstream located mafi gene, which remains associated with the 3’ end of the upstream mafb or mafb-ct gene, supporting the notion that these modules function as specific toxin-antitoxin pairs. however, in some islands, several mafis are associated with a specific mafb or mafb-ct ; it is not clear whether they are all required to confer immunity against the toxic domain of the corresponding mafb or mafb-ct.fig.  <dig> organization of maf islands in various n. meningitidis genome sequences. most islands contain a mafa, mafb  and a variable repertoire of mafb-cts interspersed with orfs, called mafis, which may encode immunity proteins . it is not clear whether all these intervenient orfs are required to confer immunity against the toxin encoded by the upstream mafb or mafb-ct gene. islands are classified as mgi- <dig>  mgi- <dig> and mgi- <dig> according to  <cit> . the phylogenic groups of the mafa and mafb genes as defined in fig.  <dig> are also indicated. the genes flanking the islands are colored green. mgi- <dig> contains a mafa and mafb from clusters i and is flanked by anmk coding for anhydro-n-acetylmuramic acid kinase and an orf encoding a small peptide of  <dig> aa that shows high sequence similarity with the n terminus of the iron-regulated rtx toxin frpc. mgi- <dig> contains a mafb of cluster ii and usually also a mafa and mafb of clusters i. this island is flanked by a proline trna gene and trk encoding a potassium transport system. mgi- <dig> contains mafa and mafb genes of clusters ii and iii, respectively, and is flanked by genes encoding ump kinase  and the putative signal peptide peptidase sppa. the mafb and mafb-ct genes can share sequence identities in their central and 5’ regions, respectively , that are probably used for homologous recombination. these regions are specific for each mafb group, which is indicated by the different colors of the underlining. the 3’ end of the mafb and mafb-ct genes corresponds to the toxic domain; it is hypervariable as indicated by different colors. the mafis remain associated with the 3’ end of the upstream mafb or mafb-cts during genetic rearrangements in the maf islands; therefore, they are colored accordingly. often additional intervenient orfs are also found behind the mafis ; whether they also contribute to conferring immunity or have other functions  is not clear. the presence of an is <dig> transposase gene in mgi- <dig> of strain g <dig> is also indicated. disrupted genes are indicated with red slashes. regions that share more than 85 % of sequence similarity between two islands are indicated with grey shadows. orfs indicated in this figure are based on genome annotations and our own analysis

fig.  <dig> phylogenetic trees of mafa and mafb proteins. for the construction of the trees, the amino-acid sequences of predicted mature mafa proteins and the n-terminal duf <dig> domain of predicted mafb proteins of different meningococcal strains were compared. the genetic distances are indicated with horizontal lines at the bottom



examination of the genomic islands revealed that mafas of phylogenetic group i are always immediately followed by a mafb of group i, whilst islands containing a mafa of group ii always contain an adjacent mafb of group iii . remarkably, the mafb genes of group ii  are not directly adjacent to a mafa, but they are located on an island  usually also containing a mafa of group i and a mafb of group i. furthermore, the mafb-cts only share sequences with the upstream located mafb or mafbs of the same phylogenetic group located on a different island , suggesting the existence of independent mafb/mafb-ct systems with genetic exchange between mafb and mafb-cts being restricted to each system.

overall, this analysis revealed that maf systems share several genetic features with the tps systems involved in interbacterial competition. accordingly, it is logical to hypothesize that  mafb is a secreted protein with growth-inhibitory properties,  mafi proteins confer specific immunity against the toxic mafb, and  mafb-cts represents a source of switchable toxic modules.

characterization of mgis in strain b16b6
to investigate our hypotheses, we used n. meningitidis strain bb- <dig>  an unencapsulated derivative of b16b <dig> of the clonal complex cc <dig>  <cit> , in which tpsa-mediated growth-inhibitory activity was previously demonstrated  <cit> . extensive pcr analysis and subsequent sequencing of pcr fragments revealed that this strain contains three mgi corresponding with islands mgi- <dig> , mgi- <dig> , and mgi- <dig>  in other meningococcal genomes . comparison of the genetic organization of the mgis of strains fam <dig> and b16b <dig>  which are both of the same clonal complex , revealed considerable differences . the genetic composition of mgi- <dig> is similar in both strains, with > 99 % of sequence identity. however, comparison of islands mgi- <dig> and mgi- <dig> of both strains revealed complex rearrangements. in mgi- <dig>  the toxic domain encoded by the first mafb gene  and the downstream mafi and mafc genes differ between the two strains . in contrast, the second mafb gene in this island  contains a similar 3’ end in the two strains. however, downstream of mafb2mgi- <dig> and its cognate mafi, there are large differences in the mafb-ct and mafi content of the two strains , and the organization in this part of island mgi- <dig> of strain b16b <dig> is actually very similar to that of mgi- <dig> of cc <dig> strain g <dig> , except that the is <dig> transposase gene is lacking. in island mgi- <dig>  the 3’ end of the mafb of b16b <dig> is different from that of fam <dig>  but similar to that of the second mafb in mgi- <dig> of strain g <dig> . after the cognate mafi, the organization of mafb-ct and mafi genes in mgi- <dig> of b16b <dig> is also deviant from that in fam <dig>  but similar to that in the corresponding island of strain mc <dig> .fig.  <dig> genetic organization of the mgi of strain b16b <dig>  b16b <dig> contains three mgis. the genetic composition of each island and their flanking regions  are in accordance with those observed in other genomes ; therefore, the same classification is applied. the different genomic features of each island are illustrated as indicated in the legend to fig.  <dig>  color coding of genes is also similar as in fig.  <dig>  the organization of the mgi of strain b16b <dig> is compared with those of fam <dig>  which is of the same clonal complex cc11; similarities are indicated with grey shadowing as in fig.  <dig>  mgi- <dig> of fam <dig> is similar to that of b16b <dig> and is therefore not depicted. dna fragments targeted by pcr for the generation of knockout constructs are indicated by lines and numbered a-h; the corresponding primers are presented in additional file 1: table s1



the very different organization of the mgi- <dig> and mgi- <dig> islands in cc <dig> strains b16b <dig> and fam <dig> is striking, since comparative analysis of the tps island in these strains and a large collection of other cc <dig> strains evidenced only a very low frequency of genetic rearrangements  <cit> . to confirm the genetic variability of the maf loci, we extended our analysis to available genome sequences of nine other cc <dig> strains, i.e. es <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  nm <dig>  nm <dig>  nm <dig>  m <dig>  nm <dig> and nm <dig>  in all these strains, the c terminal toxic domains of mafb2mgi- <dig> and mafbmgi- <dig> are similar to those of fam <dig> and b16b <dig>  whilst that of mafbmgi- <dig> is similar to that in b16b <dig> but different from that in fam <dig>  in two strains, i.e. nm <dig> and nm <dig>  the toxic domain of mafb1mgi- <dig> is similar to that of b16b <dig>  while it is similar to that of fam <dig> in the other seven strains. thus, these results suggest that the c-terminal toxic domain of mafb of phylogenetic cluster iii, which is encoded by mgi- <dig>  is rather stable in strains of the same cc <dig> lineage, as previously found for tpsa  <cit> , but the mafbs of clusters i and ii, which are encoded by mgi- <dig> and mgi- <dig>  seems to be more prone to alteration.

mafb functions in meningococcal growth inhibition
to investigate the putative role of mafb proteins in mediating growth inhibition, we first constructed several mutants of strain bb- <dig>  lacking diverse genes in different maf islands. these mutants were mixed with a rifampicin-resistant derivative of the parent strain in different ratios and the numbers of wild-type and mutant bacteria were determined by plating on selective media at time  <dig> and after different periods  of co-incubation at 37 °c while shaking. however, under these conditions, we did not observe inhibition of the growth of the mutants relative to the parent. therefore, we next performed these assays on gc plates in a candle jar, conditions that were previously found to be optimal to detect tpsa-mediated growth inhibition  <cit> . under these conditions, growth of a mutant lacking the complete mgi- <dig> island  and of a mutant lacking the entire mgi- <dig> island except for mafa  were significantly reduced in the presence of the parent, whilst that of a mutant lacking only mafa of mgi- <dig> was not inhibited . when a mutant lacking mafb <dig> and all downstream genes of island mgi- <dig> , or a mutant lacking all genes except for mafa of island mgi- <dig> , were tested in similar conditions, no significant growth inhibition by the parent was detected. these results demonstrate that at least island mgi- <dig> mediates growth inhibitory activities.fig.  <dig> growth inhibition assays. cells of a rifampicin-resistant derivative of bb- <dig> were mixed 1: <dig> with cells of mutant strains Δmafa
mgi- <dig>  lacking mafa of mgi- <dig>  Δmafb2ib-cts
mgi- <dig>  lacking mafb <dig> and all downstream genes of mgi- <dig>  Δmafbib-cts
mgi- <dig>  lacking mafb and all downstream genes of mgi- <dig>  or Δmgi- <dig> lacking the entire mgi- <dig> island, all carrying a kanamycin-resistance cassette. the suspensions were spotted on gc plates without antibiotics and incubated for 48 h. the ratios of the mutants over wild-type bacteria in the spots were determined by plating on gc media containing kanamycin or rifampicin and counting colony-forming units after overnight incubation. results are means and s.d. of three independent experiments. statistically significant differences between time  <dig> and 48 h are marked with an asterisk . all strains tested here did not show differences in viability when grown separately



mafb and mafi genes encode toxins and cognate immunity proteins
to investigate whether indeed the c-terminal part of mafbmgi- <dig> is responsible for the growth-inhibitory effect observed in the in vivo assays, we cloned the dna for this fragment from strain b16b <dig> with a flag-epitope tag into a payc184-derived vector behind an arabinose-inducible promoter. although we did not detect growth inhibitory activity in vivo of the mafbs of phylogenetic cluster i encoded by islands mgi- <dig> and mgi- <dig>  we decided to clone also, as a representative, the dna for the c-terminal fragment of mafb2mgi- <dig> to investigate whether also this protein is a toxin. it is noteworthy that this domain is recognized in the conserved domain database  as a toxin <dig> domain with a possible rnase function. in contrast, the c-terminal domain of mafbmgi- <dig> of b16b <dig> was not recognized in cdd as a putative toxic domain, but it was predicted to be a toxin_ <dig>  with 95 % probability using the hhpred server. we also cloned the mafis located immediately downstream of these mafbs on the chromosome into a pet26b vector behind an isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside -inducible t <dig> promoter; the resulting recombinant proteins contain a his <dig> tag on their c-terminal end. the plasmids were introduced in e. coli strain bl <dig> . the expression of the recombinant proteins was independently controlled with specific inducers and tested by western blotting, and cell viability after overnight induction was tested by plating the bacterial suspensions on lb plates with appropriate antibiotics. the expression of the c-terminal fragment of mafb2mgi- <dig> in e. coli resulted in a drastic reduction of cell viability compared to the non-induced control . viability was restored when the cognate mafi2mgi- <dig> was co-expressed, but not by co-expression of mafimgi- <dig>  similarly, the expression of the c-terminal part of mafbmgi- <dig> resulted in a drastic reduction of cell viability, which could be restored by co-expression of the cognate mafimgi- <dig> but not of the non-cognate mafi2mgi- <dig> . these assays confirmed that indeed the c-terminal parts of both mafbs are toxic and that their activity is specifically inhibited by the cognate mafi.fig.  <dig> 
mafb and mafi genes code for toxins and cognate immunity proteins, respectively. a the recombinant c-terminal, putatively toxic domains  of mafb2mgi- <dig> and mafbmgi- <dig> and the immunity proteins mafi2mgi- <dig> or mafimgi- <dig> of strain b16b <dig> were expressed in e. coli strain bl <dig>  and survival was determined. expression of the mafb td fragments was induced or repressed with arabinose or glucose, respectively, as indicated on top of the figure and expression of the mafi genes was induced with iptg when the corresponding plasmids were present. after overnight incubation, 20 μl of the bacterial suspensions were spread on half of an lb agar plate containing appropriate antibiotics, and the plates were incubated overnight at 37 °c. b mafi specifically interacts with the c-terminal td of the cognate mafb. bl <dig>  cells co-expressing a flag-tagged c-terminal mafb td and a his-tagged mafi were disrupted by sonication, and the lysate was mixed with ni2+ nta resin. aliquots of resin-bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by western blotting with anti-flag and anti-his monoclonal antibodies



usually, the immunity proteins of toxin-antitoxin systems confer protection through their direct interaction with the cognate toxins. to investigate whether the mafi proteins interact with the c-terminal fragments of the corresponding mafbs, pull-down assays were performed. the his-tagged immunity proteins were purified on ni2+ beads from e. coli cells also expressing the c-terminal mafb fragments, and the co-purification of the mafb fragments was examined on western blots. as anticipated, both mafb2mgi- <dig> and mafbmgi- <dig> c-terminal fragments were purified together with their cognate immunity proteins but not with non-cognate mafi . thus, these assays confirmed the role of mafi in conferring protection by specifically interacting with c-terminal domain of the cognate mafb.

discussion
toxins play an important role in the competition between bacteria for limited resources. they are produced to inhibit the growth of competitors for the same niche and, in addition, they are used for self recognition in a bacterial community. bacteria have developed several independent competition systems, including bacteriocins, tps systems, type  <dig> secretion systems, rhs, or the esx systems in gram-positive bacteria . the neisserial maf systems appear to share features with several of these previously characterized competition systems. growth inhibition in these systems is mediated by a cell-surface-exposed or secreted protein, i.e. mafb in the case of the maf system. like in many other systems, the c-terminal end of mafb contains a polymorphic toxic module, whilst the rest of the protein might be required for its secretion and/or for its interaction with receptors on the target cells. producing cells are protected against the toxic activity by a small protein, i.e. mafi in the maf system, which interacts with the toxin and is usually encoded by the gene immediately adjacent to the toxin gene. like in several other systems, the mafb and mafi genes are located on genetic islands together with a variable repertoire of genes putatively encoding n-terminally truncated toxins, called mafb-cts in the maf system  <cit> , with the cognate immunity genes. by genetic rearrangements, these mafb-cts may substitute the 3’ end of the mafb gene, thereby replacing its toxic activity, whilst the array of encoded immunity proteins may confer protection against a variety of toxins that may be encountered in the natural habitat. indeed, a variety of toxic domains may be encoded at the 3’ end of the same mafb gene in different genomes, and the same domains may be found at the 3’ end of mafb-ct genes in other genomes , clearly supporting the idea that such rearrangements occur in vivo. the substitution of the toxic module may offer a selective advantage in a given bacterial community  <cit>  but may also lead to the loss of immunity genes  <cit> . indeed, an analysis of the frequency of substitution of toxic domains in the tpsa loci of n. meningitidis evidenced that this event occurs but is very rare in isolates of the same genetic lineage and that such alteration may generate a competitive disadvantage relative to other members of the community  <cit> . similarly, our analysis of a limited set of strains of the same genetic lineage in the current study evidenced no alterations at the c terminus of mafb proteins of phylogenetic group iii encoded on mgi- <dig>  however, rearrangements were evident in mafb proteins of phylogenetic groups i and ii encoded on mgi- <dig> and mgi- <dig>  note that the mutual similarity between mafb proteins of groups i and ii is higher than their similarity to group  <dig> . it is conceivable that mafbmgi- <dig> plays a role in the maintenance of the bacterial community, while mafb proteins encoded on mgi- <dig> and mgi- <dig> may offer a selective advantage to members of a community only under specific conditions. perhaps, this may explain why we detected growth inhibitory activity only of mafbmgi- <dig> and not of mafbmgi- <dig> and mafb2mgi- <dig>  possibly, the latter mafb proteins or their cognate receptors on the target cells are not expressed under the experimental conditions used. alternatively, these proteins may target other bacterial species or eukaryotic cells. this question remains to be elucidated in future work.

the secretion mechanism of mafb was not elucidated in this work. mafb proteins were detected in the culture supernatant of n. meningitidis strain when overexpressed from a plasmid but the secretion mechanism was not solved  <cit> . mafb proteins are synthesized with an n-terminal signal sequence for transport across the inner membrane via the sec system. furthermore, all mature mafb proteins contain a conserved duf <dig> domain at their n-terminal end, which may constitute a recognition signal for the machinery that mediates its subsequent transport across the outer membrane. the mafa proteins, previously reported to function as glycolipid-binding adhesins  <cit> , are likely candidates to constitute this machinery. interestingly, our phylogenetic analysis revealed two main clusters of mafa variants, which paralleled the clustering of the mafb proteins into two main clusters based on their duf <dig> domains, suggesting specificity in the recognition of mafb proteins by the cognate mafa. however, mafa is a predicted lipoprotein and secondary structure predictions were inconsistent with a β-barrel conformation, which is common among integral outer membrane proteins, including, for example, the tpsb proteins, which mediate the transport of tpsa proteins across the outer membrane in the tps systems  <cit> . perhaps, the quaternary structure of mafa generates a channel in the outer membrane as reported, for example, for the csgg protein, which mediates the translocation of curli subunits across the outer membrane  <cit> .

some mafb proteins contain a hint domain in between the duf <dig> domain and the toxic domain. such domains are responsible and sufficient for protein splicing and could have a role in toxin processing and delivery into the target cells. there are two types of hint domains, designated type a and b, based on sequence motifs  <cit> . the hint domains, if present in mafb proteins, are of type a. proteins containing this domain undergo splicing and release of the c-terminal part  <cit> . however, most mafb proteins do not contain such a hint domain; how the c-terminal toxic moiety is released and transported into the target cells in those cases is not clear and remains to be investigated.

whilst this manuscript was in preparation, an independent study reported the toxic activity of the c-terminal domains of some of the mafb proteins of another meningococcal strain,  <dig>  and the competitive advantage of overexpression of one of these mafb proteins  <cit> , consistent with the observations reported in this paper.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we identified the neisserial mafb proteins as a novel family of toxic proteins involved in interbacterial competition. we demonstrated that the toxic activity of mafb of strain b16b <dig> resides in the c-terminal region, while mafi specifically interacts with this toxic domain to confer protection to the producing cells. further studies will be directed to elucidate the secretion mechanism of mafb and to identify possible applications of this system to fight pathogens.
