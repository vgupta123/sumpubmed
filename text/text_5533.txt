BACKGROUND
grapevine is a perennial crop in temperate climates and perceives short day petoperiod and cool temperatures as signals to onset bud endodromancy to survive winter conditions; subsequently it requires exposure to adequate chilling temperatures for several weeks  to end the dormancy . endodormancy is regulated by the physiological factors inside the affected buds  <cit> . abascisic acid  accumulates during the development of endodormancy in grapevine by suppression of bud meristem activity and its degradation is critical for dormancy release  <cit> . furthermore, ethylene is suggested to participate in the degradation of aba and budbreak by modulating the expression of aba signaling regulators  <cit> . grapevine grown in subtropical regions often exhibits non-uniform or delayed budbreak in early spring due to warm winter that provides inadequate chilling. this represents a major obstacle for the commercial production of table grapes. hydrogen cyanamide  has been found very effective for breaking the dormancy of floral buds in grapevine , kiwifruit  <cit>  and apple  <cit> . in subtropical regions, hc treatment on intact dormant buds in spring is an important grapevine orchard management practice to induce uniform budbreak. in taiwan, a subtropical region, this treatment is also a common practice in mid-summer for the second grapevine harvest in the winter, where paradormant buds on the pruned canes can be treated with hc to ensure effective budbreak. paradormancy in the latent buds in the summer is regulated by plant growth regulators originating from other organs, such as auxin from the apical meristem, affecting apical dormancy  <cit> . few studies have been focused on the mechanism of paradormancy and its release by hc. an understanding of the biochemical and molecular bases underlying the release of dormancy by hc is critical for commercial production of grapes in subtropical and tropical regions.

hc is commonly used as a nitrogen fertilizer with herbicidal and fungicidal effects. it is readily taken up by plant tissues and rapidly decomposed by cyanamide hydratase to urea, followed by urease to ammonium  <cit> . rapid detoxification of the highly toxic ammonia is achieved by the gogat pathway to produce arginine, histadine and lysine. however, cyanamide is also a very reactive substance and belongs to the classic nitriles. nitrile hydratases metabolize nitriles to the corresponding amides glutamine and asparagine. however, at high concentrations it is toxic to plants when the enzymatic breakdown of cyanamide exceeds the ammonia detoxification capacity. cyanamide is well known for its effect to break dormant buds of fruit trees. the most dramatic physiological effect of cyanamide to plants is its strong inhibition of catalase, caused by the reaction of the nitrile group with the thiols and haematin of the enzyme, and the subsequent increase in h2o <dig> content  <cit> . after hc application, cyanide  is released and breaks dormant flower buds in prunus species  <cit> . cyanide is also a co-product of cyanogenic glucoside hydrolysis  <cit> . cyanide is toxic to plants by arresting aerobic respiration  and energy production. consequently, a shift to anaerobic respiration is induced.

plants respond to hc or potassium cyanide  by eliciting the reactive oxygen species  such as h2o <dig>  as shown in sunflower seeds  <cit>  and in grapevine buds  <cit> . hypoxia , and two inhibitors of respiration  also triggers the production of h2o <dig> and ethylene, which in turn activates the antioxidant systems in grapevine buds through the mediation of the these signaling molecules  <cit> . consistently, during germination the seeds develop an anaerobic condition after imbibition due to the rapid consumption of o <dig> and the barrier imposed by the seed coat for gas exchanges, and the depletion of o <dig> in seeds is accompanied by an increase in h2o <dig> and no levels  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that hypoxia maybe the primary cause that induces budbreak and the increased levels of ros and no are the secondary products produced in response to hypoxia. a general model accounting for the major events occurring during artificially induced bud dormancy release has been proposed  <cit> . in this model, upon hc treatment a respiratory disturbance in mitochondria leads to a transient oxidative stress expressed as an increased level of ros, decreased activity of tca cycle and decreased production of atp and increased production of ethylene. to cope with energy crisis, alternative respiratory pathway, glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism and anaerobic respiration or fermentation is induced. in parallel, various antioxidant systems are upregulated to cope with the transient oxidative burst. however, the underlying mechanism leading to growth resumption remains elusive.

ros are known to play a key role in cell wall loosening in growing tissues  <cit>  and act as signalling molecules in signal transduction in cells, regulating plant growth and development in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli  <cit> . in plant cells, ros production is regulated spatially and temporally from many sources and ros reactivities take place in various cellular components, such as chloroplast, mitochondria, peroxisome, endoplasmic reticulum, apoplast, plasma membrane and cell wall , with mitochondria as the major source of ros production  <cit> . accumulation of endogenous ros in plants can be triggered by many environmental stresses, such as water deficit and salinity  <cit>  and chilling stress  <cit> , especially under high light or in combination with other stresses. generation of ros can be catalysed by many enzymes, such as glucose oxidase, xanthine oxidase, peroxidases, oxalate oxidases, amine oxidase, lipoxygenases, quinine reductases and nadph oxidases  <cit> .

membrane-bound nadph oxidases, known as respiratory burst oxidase homologues , serve as important molecular ‘hubs’ during ros mediated signalling in plants  <cit> . nadph oxidases control plant growth and development by making ros that regulate plant cell expansion through the activation of ca2+  <cit> , integrating calcium signalling and protein phosphorylation with increasing ros production  <cit> . also, the bioreactive lipoxygenase  metabolites stimulate the activity of nadph oxidases and production of ros  <cit> . the major bulk of lipoxygenases  is localized in the cytoplasm and vacuole of the plant cell  <cit> . expression of lox is regulated by different forms of stress, such as wounding, water deficiency  <cit> , or pathogen attack  <cit> . thus, nadph oxidases have a dedicated function of generating ros and act as key signalling nodes integrating multiple signal transduction pathways in plants  <cit> .

ros in the form of h2o <dig> is moderately reactive and relatively long-lived that can pass freely through membranes by diffusion and acts as a messenger in the stress signalling response  <cit> . h2o <dig> upregulates transcription factors  and tf-interacting proteins, affecting cell division, stem branching, flowering time and flower development  <cit> . the gaseous nitrogen reactive species  no may serve as an enhancer in the ros generation network  <cit> . as a key signalling molecule, no functions in different intercellular processes, including the expression of defense-related genes against pathogens and apoptosis/program cell death , maturation and senescence, stomatal closure, dormancy release during seed germination, root development and induction of ethylene emission. recent studies showed that no can be produced in plants by enzymatic and non-enzymetic systems. the major no-producing enzymes in plants are nitrate reductase in a nadh-dependent reaction and several arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthase-like  activities in different cellular compartments  <cit> . other potential enzymatic sources of no include no synthase, xanthine oxidoreductase, peroxidase, cytochrome p <dig>  and some hemeproteins.

to control ros levels under oxidative stress, organisms induce a variety of antioxidant enzymes and compounds to scavenge ros and rns in the cells. within a cell, the superoxide dismutases  in various cellular organelles constitute the first line of defense against ros  <cit> . other defense enzymes, including catalase , ascorbate peroxidase , guaiacol peroxidase , glutathione reductase , monodehydroascorbate reductase , and dehydroascorbate reductase , protect their cellular constituents by scavenging the harmful ros and thus maintaining the normal cellular redox state  <cit> . the antioxidant compounds ascorbate and glutathione serve as cofactors in some of these scavenging reactions. earlier studies showed that hc inhibits grapevine bud catalase gene expression during the first 4 days of treatment, but induces transcripts for the enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase  and alcohol dehydrogenase   <cit> . in grapevine buds, hc also upregulates oxidative stress-related genes, such as thioredoxin h , glutathione s-transferase , ascorbate peroxidase , glutathione reductase , and hypoxia related genes, such as sucrose synthase   <cit> . after exposure to hc, peroxidase activity in a number of plants is increased. peroxidases utilize different organic electron donors to reduce h2o <dig>  natural chilling also leads to similar induction of these genes during the last stage of the dormancy cycle of grape buds  <cit> . class  <dig> nonsymbiotic hemoglobin is involved in scavenging of no . its expression is increased during hypoxic stress, application of respiratory chain inhibitors  and high level of nitrate.

accumulation of excessive ros  and rns  in turn induces the activation of alternative electron-transport pathway to prevent accumulation of excessive ros, and the expression of alternative oxidase gene  is also known to respond to various stresses in plants  <cit> . the expression of aox <dig> affects both ros and rns generation and accumulation through the respiratory chain in mitochondria . expression of aox is up-regulated in grapevine buds by hc treatment  <cit> , but hc treatment increased h2o <dig> production in grapevine buds  <cit> . clearly, a complicate regulatory network controlling ros metabolism exists in plant cells. moreover, as many genes exist in a gene family whether all members in the family are affected by the same stimuli is not known. thus, how hc exactly affects the ros regulatory network during grapevine dormancy release remains unclear.

to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of the release of paradormancy in the summer grapevine buds by p and hc, this study aimed to follow the changes of endogenous ros and no levels in the intact dormancy breaking buds by cytochemical staining and identify the candidate genes being significantly altered by microarray analysis. go categories that are related to ros-generating, ros-scavenging, and no detoxification were identified as key early factors in grapevine dormant bud break. the expression dynamics of these factors during the early stages of budbreak support the importance of a rapid accumulation of ros and rns with a concomitant activation of related genes for budbreak.

RESULTS
budbreak rate
after 8 days, the budbreak rates of dormant grapevine buds treated with p , hc , phc  and water  were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 0 %, respectively . obviously, hc alone was more effective in promoting dormant budbreak than p. the effect of hc on breaking dormant buds was further enhanced by p. a combined p and hc  treatment gave rise to the highest dormant budbreak, showing a synergetic interaction between p and hc. during the treatment with phc, the breaking buds enlarged and sprouted rapidly between  <dig> and 192 h . anatomical examination before and after phc treatment showed an active growth resumption of floral meristem starting at 12 h . four to five leaf primordia were visible at 12 h and the inflorescence meristem began to develop at 48 h , and the inflorescence primodia became well developed with complete floral meristem at 96 h post treatment .fig.  <dig> morphological and anatomical changes in grapevine buds during dormancy break. percentages of budbreak after 192 h of treatment with p, hc, phc, or water as a control  . changes in bud length after phc treatment at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 192 h  . longitudinal sections of grapevine floral bud development during release of dormancy after phc treatment:  0 h,  6 h,  12 h,  24 h,  48 h and  96 h. ip: inflorescence primordium . bar: 200 μm



in situ detection of h2o <dig>  o2•- and no
the accumulation of h2o <dig> in the grapevine buds during the treatments was first quantitatively determined by measuring the fe-h2o <dig> complex in the buds  <cit> . for all four treatments, h2o <dig> increased rapidly and almost linearly, reaching its maximum level after 12 h and decreased slightly thereafter , and the averaged amounts on a fresh weight basis were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg/g for the control, p, hc, and phc treatments, respectively. the accumulation of h2o <dig>  o2•- and no was subsequently examined by staining in situ in the bud longitudinal sections after 12 h of treatment. a similar pattern of accumulation among these treatments for h2o <dig>  o2•- and no was also observed, with the highest levels detected in the phc treated buds and the lowest levels in the control buds. when the sections were incubated with specific scavengers of ros or inhibitor of no, no staining occurred, showing a low background as in the control sections. the results confirmed the specificity of the in situ staining of these reactive species. thus, h2o <dig>  o2•- and no significantly accumulated in the sections of buds treated with phc, followed by hc and p . the results suggest that intensive h2o <dig>  o2•- and no production took place in the treated dormant buds at the early stage of budbreak. these levels are positively correlated with the percentages of budbreak .fig.  <dig> levels of h2o <dig> in the control, p, hc and phc treated buds. hydroperoxide was assayed by the ferric-xylenol orange  complex  <cit> . after incubation in the dark for 30 min, the absorbance was read at 560 nm with 100 μm xylenol orange as blank

microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes  and clustering of expressed genes
to gain insights into the early mode of molecular action during grapevine budbreak transcriptomic profiles in buds treated with p, hc and phc for 24 h were examined by microarray using agilent 44 k gene expression array with specific probes for grapevine genes. an earlier time course study showed that the numbers of up- and down-regulated genes in grapevine buds treated with hc reached the peak around 24 h post-treatment  <cit> . clustering of the expressed genes into functional categories in the buds treated with p, hc, and phc were based on genspring analysis, and the changes in transcript abundance were identified by m/a plot. a larger distribution of transcript abundance was found in the buds treated with phc, followed by hc and p , consistent with its strong potency on dormancy release. however, it must be pointed out that transcriptional activation of some genes that occurred within 24 h of treatment may have not been identified.

identification of common differentially expressed genes  among treatments
analysis by genspring indicated that a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes showed significantly up-regulated expression and a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes showed significantly down-regulated expression by p, hc and phc treatments, respectively . clearly, alteration in expression of many genes is involved in dormant budbreak in grapevine and many more genes were up-regulated than down-regulated by these treatments, similar to that reported in grape after treatment with hc  <cit> .  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were common for all three treatments, indicating similar molecular events occurred in these buds . among the commonly up-regulated genes with a greater than a log2-fold change in expression are those coding for tf factors  and functional genes coding for protein kinase, peroxidase, ion oxygenase, amine oxidase, pr proteins, dirigent proteins, expansin and extension . the expression of some genes related to degradation of cyanamide , synthesis of pigments  and metabolism of growth regulators  was also upregulated. in particular, the hypoxia related gene coding for sucrose synthase  was significantly up-regulated by all three treatments, especially by phc. among the commonly down-regulated genes are those coding for tfs  and functional genes coding for chloroplast chaperone danj <dig>  pr proteins, protein kinase, ubiquitin ligase, cytochrome p- <dig> and peroxidase  <dig> and  <dig>  these genes are generally related to stress responses in hormonal action, ros metabolism, and transition to growth resumption process.fig.  <dig> venn diagrams to show the overlap of significantly up- and down-regulated genes among different treatments. comparison of significantly up-  and down–regulated genes  among p, hc and phc treatments after 24 h of treatment. microarray data analyses yielded  <dig> significantly up- and  <dig> significantly down-regulated genes by the  <dig> treatments with at least two fold changes 



classification of up- and down- regulated genes involved in ros/no metabolism
go categories by erminej analysis of ros related genes that were up- or down-regulated in molecular function 24 h post-treatment were listed in table  <dig>  many ros- and no-related genes showed significant alteration in expression. we identified clear overlaps of the molecular functions among the up- and down-regulated genes in response to p, hc and phc treatments. go terms in which their gene expression levels altered significantly  by the treatments were listed in additional file  <dig>  phc induced more up- and down-regulated genes than hc and p treatments. also, there are genes commonly regulated by all three treatments. among the ros-generating genes, the two respiratory burst oxidase homolog genes related to go: <dig> , vvrbohe and vvrboha, were down-regulated by phc, while only vvrboha was down-regulated by hc. however, vvrbohe was upregulated by p and hc.table  <dig> number of genes that were expressed in each treatment, as identified by go categories

these were significantly up/down regulated genes related to ros/no metabolism in grapevine buds treated with p, hc and phc following the go categories by erminej analysis



the ros-scavenging peroxidases related to go: <dig> exist in a big gene family, and many of vvpod genes were up-/down-regulated, especially by hc and phc . obviously, most of the pod genes were upregulated and they are assumed to play a key role in the reduction of h2o <dig> in grapevine buds treated with hc  <cit> . for other ros-scavenging genes in go: <dig> , the expressions of five gene families have been up- or down-regulated by the three treatments. for example, one alpha-dioxygenase gene  was up-regulated by p and hc, but not by phc. gene coding for glutathione peroxidase  was up-regulated by phc whereas another  gene was down-regulated by hc and phc. after 24 h of treatment, two catalase isozyme 1-like genes  were down-regulated by both hc and phc. in addition, vvapx coding for cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase was down-regulated by both hc and phc, and vvfsd coding for chloroplastic superoxide dismutase   was down-regulated by phc whereas vvfsd <dig> was up-regulated by phc. the expression of vvaox that codes for alternative oxidase in mitochondria was up-regulated by both hc and phc. for no related genes, the expression of hemoglobin- <dig> gene  in binding  was significantly up-regulated by both hc and phc. the expression of the genes in the three ros related transcription factor gene families , namely heat stress transcription factor , ethylene response element binding factor  and wrky transcription factor , was also differentially altered. the numbers of vvhsf genes up-/down-regulated by p, hc, and phc were 0/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  and 3/ <dig>  respectively, while the numbers of vverf genes up-/down-regulated expressed by these treatments were 4/ <dig>  8/ <dig>  and 8/ <dig>  respectively. many of the vvwrky genes were also up-/down-regulated, especially by hc and phc , compared to p . these results indicate that more genes are altered in their expression at a higher intensity by phc and the expressions of different genes in the same go category are differentially regulated by these treatments.

expression dynamics of ros/no-related genes during phc treatment
quantitative rt-pcr  was used to confirm the alteration in expression of  <dig> selected degs identified by cdna microarray and profile the expression dynamics of these genes during the 48 h of phc treatment using eif4a as a reference gene as its expression did not change substantially  <cit> . the degs included  <dig> genes coding for ros-generating ,  <dig> genes coding for ros-scavenging  and one gene coding for no-scavenging  . the expression profiles of these  <dig> genes during the 48 h treatment showed different tempos, with most of their expression peaked at  <dig> or 12 h, indicating a transient nature. a similar trend in gene expression was also reported in detached grapevine canes treated with hc or heat shock   <cit> . two of the ros-generating respiratory burst oxidase homologue genes, vvrbohe and vvrboha, and the scavenging peroxidase gene vvpod <dig> were down-regulated by more than two folds throughout the first 48 h of treatment. in significant contrast, the expression of the peroxidase gene vvpod <dig> started to increase after 6 h of treatment and reached its maximum expression at 12 h , but dropped off to normal levels thereafter, consistent with the results obtained by microarray . thus, vvpod <dig> and several other members of the peroxidase family  played an important role in early ros metabolism by scavenging h2o <dig> upon phc treatment, which synchronized with the new meristem growth .table  <dig> list of genes that were used to profile their expression dynamics by qrt-pcr

fig.  <dig> changes in transcript abundance of  <dig> up- and down-regulated ros/no-related genes during 48 h treatment with phc, as analyzed by qrt-pcr. these include  <dig> ros-generating genes  , and  <dig> ros-scavenging genes  and one no-scavenging gene  . the selection of these genes was based on their relative expression levels obtained by the microarray analysis 



for other ros-scavenging genes, the alpha-dioxygenase vvdox <dig> showed a rapid increase  in transcript as early as 6 h post treatment and declined gradually throughout the treatment. a small increase  in the glutathione peroxidase vvgpx <dig> transcript was detected as early as 6 h, but its expression accelerated rapidly thereafter and reached its maximum expression  at 12 h, but dropped off to  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold at  <dig> and 48 h, respectively. for the ascorbate peroxidase gene vvapx <dig>  a rapid increase of transcript  was detected as early as 6 h and reached its maximum expression  at 12 h and slowly declined to  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold at  <dig> and 48 h, respectively. interestingly, vvfsd <dig> and vvfsd, both coding for chloroplastic superoxide dismutases , showed different expression patterns: vvfsd <dig> expression decreased progressively from  <dig>  fold at 6 h to  <dig>  fold at 24 h after treatment but increased to  <dig>  folds after 48 h of treatment, whereas the expression of vvfsd showed a rapid increase as early as 6 h  but declined gradually to a normal level at 48 h. the mitochondrial alternative oxidase vvaox <dig> also showed a rapid increase in expression  as early as 6 h but declined gradually to a normal level at 48 h. it is also noticeable that the expression of the peroxisomal catalase isozyme-like vvcat <dig> was first down-regulated, decreasing progressively from  <dig>  fold at 6 h to  <dig>  fold at 24 h, but increased to  <dig>  fold after 48 h of treatment. the initial downregulation of catalase expression may have contributed to the rapid accumulation of h2o <dig>  <cit> , but its subsequent rise in expression may have prevented the buildup of a lethal level of h2o <dig>  a rapid increase in the hemoglobin- <dig>  transcript was detected at 6 h  and it reached its maximum expression  at 12 h, but its transcript level dropped off from  <dig>  at 24 h to  <dig>  fold at 48 h, similar to that reported in an earlier study  <cit> . this result suggests that the intensive expression of hemoglobin  <dig> is triggered by the treatment at very early stage of the treatment and may be important in scavenging no. taken together, these results suggest that the two nadph oxidases, vvrbohe and vvrboha, may not be a key player in ros generation, while vvpod <dig>  vvdox <dig>  vvgpx <dig>  vvapx <dig> and vvhb <dig> are important for ros and no scavenging, respectively . overall, these results are in agreement with those obtained by microarray analysis after 24 h of treatment with hc .

discussion
hc has been frequently used to break endodormancy of floral buds in grape and several studies have been conducted to address its physiological and molecular basis  <cit> . however, study on its application to release paradormancy of grape floral buds in the summer has received very little attention. this study aimed to address the early mode of action of phc, a combination of pruning and hc, with intact grape canes on its effective alleviation of bud dormancy in hot summer that results in uniform budbreak and floral development without chilling requirement. phc induced budbreak much more rapidly and efficiently than p or hc alone, indicating a synergetic interaction between p and hc treatments . compared to the long period of time required for budbreak by chilling  <cit> , the rapid induction of budbreak by phc observed in this study may in part be due to the nature of dormancy and the warm temperatures in the summer which accelerate metabolism and growth. large amounts of h2o <dig>  o2•- and no accumulated rapidly in the buds upon the treatments, especially by phc ; and the amount of h2o <dig> in the buds increased almost linearly in the buds, reaching its maximum level within 12 h . moreover, the ros levels accumulated are closely correlated with the percentage of budbreak among these treatments, and this strong, transient oxidative burst coincides with growth resumption in the buds . similarly, previous studies also showed that grape buds respond to hc and kc by eliciting ros, such as h2o <dig>  <cit> . thus, a combination of p and hc is most effective in eliciting rapid accumulation of ros and release of the paradormant buds in summer grapevine.

to provide insights into the molecular basis of hc effect on breaking dormant buds in grapevine, we conducted transcriptomic analysis during budbreak. our transcriptomic profile provided a clear link between gene expression and ros accumulation during the early stage of budbreak. upon phc treatment expression of a number of specific genes was altered rapidly to accommodate the metabolic activities required for budbreak and growth resumption. as expected, the numbers of significantly up-/down-regulated genes were highest in phc treated buds, compared to hc and p treated buds . moreover, phc exerted a higher intensity of regulation, relative to other treatments. although p, hc and phc induced dormant budbreak at varying degrees, many transcription factor  and functional genes were commonly induced or suppressed by these treatments . these genes/proteins must play important roles in budbreak response. many of the upregulated tfs, such as wrkys  <cit>  and erf   <cit> , are known to be involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses, whereas some other tfs, such as bhlh and nam-b <dig>  are related to cell and tissue development. for example, bhlhs exhibit a range of different roles in plant cell and tissue development  <cit> , and nam-b <dig> acts in a tissue specific manner to regulate monocarpic senescence and grain filling  <cit> . consistently, ethylene biosynthesis is reported to increase in grape buds in response to hc and hs treatments and plays a key role in dormancy release by activating erfs  <cit> , and the high levels of ethylene accumulated in the submerged tissues promote shoot elongation  <cit>  and parenchyma formation  <cit> .

many of the upregulated functional genes, such as protein kinase, peroxidase, amine oxidase, pr proteins, expansin and extension, are related to plant defense responses and cellular growth. for example, protein kinases are universal signal transduction modules in eukaryotes  <cit> . amine oxidase that catalyzes the oxidative de-amination of polyamines and production of h2o <dig> has been correlated with cell wall maturation and lignification during development as well as wound-healing and cell wall reinforcement during pathogen invasion  <cit> . peroxidases that catalyze the reduction of h2o <dig> are known to be involved in cell wall loosening  <cit> . thus, these two enzymes may be the key players of ros metabolism in the cell wall during dormant budbreak in grapevine, as exerted by phc. pr proteins are thought to be involved in plant defense responses  <cit>  and response to infection by pathogens  <cit> . in addition, expansin is related to cell wall loosening  <cit> , while extensins expressed under stress and non-stress conditions   <cit>  are related to defense and control of extension growth  <cit> . thus, these commonly induced tf and functional genes in stress response, oxidative burst, hormonal regulation, and reprogramming of cellular developmental and physiological processes must play important roles in the ros regulatory network leading to dormancy breaking and bud sprouting in grapevine. earlier microarray analyses with detached grapevine canes also suggest that hc and hs break the dormant buds through the link between sublethal stress, mitochondrial activity, temporary hypoxic conditions, ethylene metabolism, ros scavenging activity and cell enlargement during bud dormancy release  <cit> .

among the down-regulated tfs, nac is known to be involved in biotic and abiotic stress response, fus <dig> controls multiple elementary processes during seed development  <cit> , abi <dig> is related to insensitivity to aba in seed germination and during embryogenesis  <cit> , and athb regulates root hair development and promotes procambial and cambial vascular cell differentiation  <cit> . in addition, myb regulates proanthocyanidian biosynthesis in grapes  <cit> , and gata-like has been implicated in light-dependent and nitrate-dependent control of transcription  <cit> . among the down-regulated functional genes, chaperone dnaj regulates heat shock response  <cit>  for proper folding of newly synthesized polypeptides  <cit>  and ubiquitin ligases is an important part of cellular regulation in arabidopsis  <cit> . most of these responses may reflect temporary impairment of normal metabolic activities under the oxidative stress conditions.

expression dynamics of ros metabolism related genes
phc triggered a rapid generation and accumulation of ros and no peaked at 12 h , with a concomitant transcriptional activation of related genes peaked at 6–12 h post-treatment . ros levels are controlled by a network of generating and scavenging enzyme systems. for ros generation, phc highly induced pod <dig>  but suppressed rbohe, rboha and pod <dig> at the early stages of treatment. besides amine oxidase , these results emphasize the importance of pod <dig> and other peroxidase members in ros generation in cell wall during paradormant bud break in the summer grapevine. consistently, previous results also suggest that peroxidase activity is increased largely in grapevine buds upon fulfilment of chilling requirement  <cit>  and it may play an important role in consumption or release of ros and in cell wall modification  <cit> . in response to oxidative burst genes coding for the various antioxidant systems, e.g. gpx <dig>  cat <dig>  apx <dig>  aox <dig>  dox <dig> and hb <dig>  were also rapidly turned on in the dormancy breaking buds to scavenge ros and no. as reported earlier, after 12–24 h of hc treatment, gr, gst and apx genes are upregulated in grapevine buds  <cit> . gpx and apx catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water by using glutathione and ascorbate, respectively, as a specific electron donor  <cit> . in addition, glutathione is a strong detoxifying agent and has been shown to bind hc directly on its free thiol groups  <cit> .

earlier studies suggest a general model accounting for the major events occurring during artificially induced bud dormancy release  <cit> . cellular hypoxia is considered the primary cause that induces budbreak while the increased levels of ros and no are the secondary products produced in response to hypoxia. disturbance in mitochondria leads to a transient oxidative stress expressed as an increased level of ros, decreased activity of tca cycle and decreased production of atp and increased production of ethylene. alternative respiratory pathway, glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism and anaerobic respiration or fermentation is subsequently induced to cope with energy crisis. our results are in general consistent with this model. however, there are unique features derived from this study that may be attributed to the nature of the plant material used. these studies mainly addressed the release of endodomancy by hc in the spring, while the present study was focused on the release of paradormncy of grapevine buds in the hot summer. for example, aba is known to accumulate during the development of endodormancy in grapevine by suppression of bud meristem activity and its degradation mediated by ethylene is critical for dormancy release  <cit> . it is unlikely that well-irrigated grapevines in the summer accumulate aba in the paradormant buds. in this study, pruning resulted in a budbreak rate of 33 % , which is consistent with paradormancy in the latent buds in the summer as regulated by plant growth regulators originating from other organs , affecting apical dormancy  <cit> . however, the hormone ethylene is clearly involved in growth resumption in both types of dormancy.

based on our results and the literature, we propose a working model to integrate the early physiological and molecular events underlying the release of paradormancy by phc in grapevine buds . upon phc treatment, the release of cyanide  rapidly disturbed aerobic respiration and resulted in cellular hypoxia, and the inhibition of catalase by cyanide promoted h2o <dig> accumulation. ros  and rns  were also rapidly produced by nadph oxidase/amine oxidase and nadh dependent nitrate reductase/arginine-nitric oxide synthase, respectively. the gaseous no in turn served as an enhancer in the ros regulatory network  <cit> . to prevent the accumulation of lethal levels of ros/rns and pcd, the expression of specific genes involved in various metabolic activities  and antioxidant systems  were induced. h2o <dig> and.oh activated ca2+ channels and initiated signal transduction through protein kinase activity, leading to expression of specific stress-responsive tfs  to regulate ros producing and scavenging pathways and cellular metabolism  <cit> . apoplastic.oh in the presence of h2o <dig> and o2•- interacted with cell wall component leading to modification of cell wall structure for expansion growth  <cit> . whereas the ros produced in the cytosol or transported from the apoplast served as signal molecules  <cit>  and triggered the expression of stress-induced specific tfs for the expression of related downstream functional genes responsible for dormancy breaking and growth resumption  in grapevine buds. the accumulation of ethylene in the buds promoted cell elongation and chlorenchyma formation by activating related erfs.fig.  <dig> proposed mechanistic model for paradormancy release by phc in grapevine buds. upon application, hc causes immediate cellular hypoxia through the action of released cyanide on aerobic respiration and inhibition of catalase activity and induces h2o <dig> production. ros  and rns  are rapidly produced possibly by several enzymatic systems, such as nadph oxidase, amine oxidase, nitrate reductase and arginine-nitric oxide synthase. h2o <dig> and ethylene act as signaling molecules activating genes involved in antioxidant defense systems. the antioxidant machinery and related pathways  are upregulated to maintain ros and rns at sublethal levels to avoid pcd. h2o <dig> in the cell wall induces cell wall loosening and expansion. h2o <dig> also functions in anabolic, signaling and defense pathways and in the synthesis of the other ross,.oh in the presence of h2o <dig> and o2
•- exerts a wall loosening effect, and h2o <dig> also drives peroxidase-mediated cross-linking of structural cell wall components. in the signal transduction pathway, ros triggers the expression of ros responsive genes. h2o <dig> and.oh activate ca2+ channels and initiate a signal transduction and activate protein kinase activity, which in turn activates different transcription factors to regulate ros scavenging and ros producing pathways. finally, these transcription factors control the downstream functional gene expression responsible for dormancy release and growth resumption in grapevine buds. the accumulation of ethylene in the buds promotes cell elongation and parenchyma formation by activating related erfs



it’s clear that the buildup of a sublethal level of ros and rns is a common denominator for bud dormancy release in grapevine in response to natural chilling, hs, p and hc treatments. enhanced expression of the antioxidant enzymes gst, apx, gr, gpx, aox and expansin is also reported by hc and hs treatment  <cit>  and during the last stage of chilling requirement in grapevine  <cit> . also, genes related to aba, auxin, ethylene and salicylic acid metabolism are commonly regulated by these treatments. the interplay among these growth regulators leads to cell expansion and division and growth resumption. thus, judged from the fact that a repertoire of the similar genes is commonly induced by hc, hs, p and natural chilling in a temporary nature, this ros/nrs regulatory network is essential for the release of bud dormancy in grape and possibly other plants as well.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, phc effectively releases paradormancy in grapevine buds in the summer with a rapid accumulation of ros and rns and a concomitant transcriptional activation of related genes. our transcriptional profiling links the rapid transcriptional activation of specific ros related genes and accumulation of various ros and rns underlying the early physiological process during dormant bud break as affected by phc. the key up-/down-regulated genes identified are all related to ros metabolism in three important go categories: peroxidase activity, antioxidant activity and transcription factor. most of these genes exhibited a peak expression 6–12 h post-treatment, coinciding with the maximum accumulation of ros at 12 h. the ros scavenging activities mediated by various antioxidant systems avoid the buildup of lethal levels of ros and rns to trigger pcd. the sublethal levels of ros in turn trigger cell wall loosening and the expression of genes  necessary for cell expansion and extension required for new bud growth as regulated by related hormones . as the overall response to a number of dormancy releasing treatments is remarkably similar, this simplified working model of ros regulatory network may describe the important molecular and biochemical events during budbreak in grapes and other species as well.
