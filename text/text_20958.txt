BACKGROUND
gm <dig> gangliosidosis, a lysosomal storage disease that affects the brain and multiple systemic organs, is caused by an autosomal recessively inherited deficiency in acid β-galactosidase, which is encoded by the glb <dig> gene  <cit> . gm <dig> gangliosidosis in shiba inu dogs was first reported in  <dig>  <cit> . the causative mutation has been identified as a deletion of the cytosine in exon  <dig> at nucleotide position  <dig> in the putative coding region  of the canine glb <dig> gene  <cit> , thereby enabling molecular diagnosis and/or genotyping with polymerase chain reaction -based dna tests  <cit> . affected dogs manifest neurological signs of progressive motor dysfunction from 5– <dig> months of age and die at 12– <dig> months after a clearly defined clinical course  <cit> , which is associated with progressive accumulation of gm <dig> ganglioside and the subsequent neuronal damage in the central nervous system  <cit> .

the shiba inu breed is indigenous to and one of the most popular breeds in japan, where it has been designated as a protected species since  <dig> . thirty to forty thousand puppies are registered every year in japan  <cit> . shiba inu dogs have been transported worldwide and are bred and maintained as a standard breed in many countries. therefore, it is necessary to control and reduce the prevalence of gm <dig> gangliosidosis to maintain the quality of this traditional breed and to ensure supply of healthy dogs to prospective breeders and owners in japan and other countries.

previously, a preliminary genotyping survey of the disease was carried out on  <dig> shiba inu dogs from only the hokkaido and the tohoku districts  in northern japan  <cit> . this survey revealed  <dig> carriers among the  <dig> dogs. although, carriers appear to be distributed all over japan, specific areas and kennels may show high prevalence. therefore, a large-scale and nationwide survey is necessary to know the current overall and regional prevalence and carrier frequency in japan, as well as to formulate an effective strategy for the control and prevention of this disease.

in the present study, a large-scale molecular epidemiological survey of gm <dig> gangliosidosis in the shiba inu breed was carried out among  <dig> dogs from all the districts of japan by using a genotyping test to determine the current overall and regional carrier frequency. the number and native district of affected dogs identified in  <dig> years from  <dig> to june  <dig> were also surveyed retrospectively. the pathway of transmission and distribution of the mutant allele were analyzed on the basis of pedigree information of the affected dogs and carriers identified previously and in this study. in this report, we also discuss the control and prevention of the disease on the basis of the results of these analyses.

RESULTS
carrier frequency
the results of the nationwide molecular epidemiological survey are shown in table  <dig>  this survey revealed  <dig> wild-type dogs,  <dig> carriers, and no affected dogs in the population of  <dig> animals. the carrier frequency in the population was  <dig> %. among the  <dig> carriers identified,  <dig> dogs were from the kinki district and the other  <dig> dogs were from the hokkaido, kanto, and shikoku districts.

* including okinawa prefecture, the small islands south of kyushu island.

retrospective survey and pedigree analysis
the retrospective survey conducted using information collected over  <dig> years from  <dig> to  <dig> revealed  <dig> affected dogs  and several carriers that were related to these affected dogs. the first affected dog , born in the hokkaido district in  <dig>  was diagnosed with gm <dig> gangliosidosis histopathologically and biochemically  <cit> , which was confirmed by molecular analysis using stored dna and rna  <cit> . since this case, other affected dogs with the same molecular defect have been diagnosed sporadically until recently . of the  <dig> affected dogs identified,  <dig> dogs were born within the last  <dig> years. the pedigree relationships among these affected dogs and the native district of each dog are shown in figure  <dig>  although pedigree data were not available for  <dig> affected dogs, the remaining  <dig> affected dogs and several related carriers identified previously showed a blood relationship, according to the results of the pedigree analysis. regarding the native districts,  <dig> affected dogs were from the kinki region, accounting for approximately half of all the affected animals.

a pedigree analysis was also performed using the data from  <dig> carriers  identified in the present epidemiological survey. no pedigree data was available for the  <dig> remaining carriers. c1-ka and c2-ki also showed a blood relationship with the affected dogs and carriers identified in the retrospective survey .

discussion
recessively inherited disorders such as lysosomal storage diseases are a major problem in the breeding of pure-breed domestic animals  <cit> . identification of the carriers that have one abnormal allele in the gene pair, but that are normal in clinical appearance, is critical because there are no physical clues to the presence of the disease in these animals; however, the mutation is transmitted to half of their progeny  <cit> . the frequency of carriers in a population substantially exceeds the incidence of the disease; therefore, the presence of carriers makes recessive diseases the most difficult to control in pure-breed animals  <cit> . canine gm <dig> gangliosidosis has been reported in other pure-breed dogs including english springer spaniels  <cit> , portuguese water dogs  <cit> , and alaskan huskies  <cit> ; however, to the best of our knowledge, a large-scale molecular epidemiological survey has not been performed to establish effective measures for the control and prevention of the disease.

our results demonstrated that the overall carrier frequency of gm <dig> gangliosidosis among shiba inu dogs in japan is  <dig> % . in this study, regional data for northern  and western or southern japan  were not fully evaluated because of the low number of samples collected from these regions. among the districts sufficiently surveyed by a large number of samples, kinki had the highest carrier frequency , which is more than  <dig> times that in kanto . as the number of carriers is small, the calculated frequency could potentially be changed dramatically by chance. specific families that include carriers may have also affected the frequency . therefore, the limitation of this study is that the calculated disease prevalence and carrier frequency may be influenced by chance.

in the retrospective survey, in the last  <dig> years,  <dig> affected dogs were identified, and  <dig> dogs of these were born within the last  <dig> years , suggesting a recent increase in the prevalence of the disease. of the  <dig> affected dogs identified,  <dig> dogs were from the kinki district. of the  <dig> affected dogs identified in the last  <dig> years,  <dig> dogs were from the kinki district, suggesting a recent increase in the prevalence in japan, probably due to the high incidence of affected dogs in the kinki district. the high incidence of affected dogs in the kinki district seems to be attributable to a small number of popular carrier sires  in the same region.

there are  <dig> district affiliates in nihon-ken hozon-kai, a major kennel club specializing in japanese traditional breeds . furthermore, each district affiliate has several regional branch divisions with many kennels. most kennels are small with only a few breeding dogs. regional activities such as local dog-shows are carried out in each branch division before the district and nationwide activities. therefore, there is a strong relationship among the kennels belonging to the same branch division. mating also tends to be among dogs in the same branch division, resulting in potential inbreeding and homozygosity responsible for inherited disorders.

in the present study, a kennel with a very high prevalence of the disease was found in the kinki district by pedigree analysis. this kennel housed  <dig> carriers, who were divisional champion dogs , which produced many of the affected and carrier offspring in the kinki district. such kennels may be producing affected dogs sporadically by unknowingly mating carriers. it is thought that affected dogs are produced in a small proportion of kennels with high prevalence, and the mutant allele is then distributed to the surrounding areas from those kennels. this may be the reason behind the relationship between regional prevalence and carrier frequency in gm <dig> gangliosidosis in shiba inu dogs. a similar trend was observed in a survey of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in the border collie breed in japan  <cit> . therefore, for the effective control and prevention of these fatal inherited diseases, it is necessary to examine as many breeding dogs as possible, especially from kennels located in areas with high prevalence and carrier frequency. in addition, genotyping of specimens from a random population of breeding dogs should be continued to detect sporadic carriers and prevent their use from being used as breeding dogs  <cit> . these approaches will also gradually decrease the number of dogs carrying the mutant allele. these active and continuous preventive measures may be necessary to eliminate gm <dig> gangliosidosis in shiba inu dogs.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the results of the present study, the current carrier frequency for gm <dig> gangliosidosis in the overall shiba inu dog population in japan is  <dig> %, and it is rather high  in the kinki district. the high carrier frequency in the kinki region seems to be related to the high prevalence in this district. therefore, for the effective control and prevention of this disease, it is necessary to examine as many breeding dogs as possible from all regions of japan, especially from kennels located in areas with high prevalence and carrier frequency.
