BACKGROUND
until a few years ago it was widely believed that peptides of chain lengths well below  <dig> residues are conformationally highly flexible or even disordered, whereas the longer polypeptide chains of proteins form stable native conformations . the latter seemed natural as native conformations are mainly stabilized by hydrophobic cores, and proteins can have a much higher ratio of core volume to total size than small peptides. 

over the last years the traditional belief had to give way to a more differentiated picture: it was found that peptides can show a pronounced propensity for adopting a significant population of ordered secondary structure  <cit> , and there have been examples of peptides with stable and well-defined tertiary structures  <cit>  or  <cit> . remarkably, although the latter peptides have native conformations, they are not just smaller versions of typically multi-functional proteins but either designed peptides , or derived from single protein domains , or they have no functions that require interaction with different specific molecules . hence, it is plausible to assume that the observed rough correlation of larger size and well-defined conformation of proteins is not so much a consequence of elementary biophysics but of biological evolution in environments rich in specific functional interactions. evolution may have selected molecules with numerous different and well-defined surface patches for specific functional interactions, and the necessity of harboring many such well-defined patches on the same molecule naturally leads to larger, conformationally stable polypeptides. therefore, by ignoring such biological effects and concentrating on physical feasibility one can expect that it is possible to identify or design many more peptides that fold into stable native structures in the huge sequence space of  <dig> to  <dig> residues.

for biotechnology and medicine such peptides would be interesting tools  <cit> . in these disciplines it is often aspired to have a molecule with a single specific function, and this could be realized with molecules much smaller than a typical protein. smaller molecules potentially also have better bioavailability, are less immunogenic and cheaper. an illustrative example is the design of small peptide mimotopes, i.e. peptides that mimic a large protein antigen by presenting just the epitope interacting with the antibody. in this case we require that the designed peptide is optimized with respect to several objectives simultaneously, e.g. small size, conformational stability, and presentation of the epitope in its native form and accessibility. the conventional way of solving such a problem is the definition of a scalar fitness function that combines these objectives, e.g. as a linear combination of single objectives. however, such combinations are notoriously problematic because the functional form of the fitness is usually unknown. a typical case is the use of experimental data  and classical force field in the refinement of biomolecular structures. there, one usually combines experimental constraints and force field to a pseudo-energy. often the functional form of this pseudo-energy is assumed to be a linear combination of the two terms with the weights determined from practical experience. if such a form is not known, the multitude of objectives cannot be combined to a single scalar objective function. a way to circumvent this problem is inferential structure determination  <cit>  where simulation data is used to probabilistically rank possible solutions, though not to drive an optimization. multi-objective- or pareto-optimization could be applied there as an alternative. the fundamental difference between single-and multi-objective optimization is that the set of optima in general is much larger for the latter method as it allows for a flexible trade-off between the various objectives  <cit> . practically, this means that during a single-objective optimization one often has only one optimum , whereas multi-objective methods usually forwards a whole set of optima, the pareto-front . for the optimization of molecules pareto-methods are currently addressed by several groups  <cit> , though most of these researchers focus on the optimization of small molecules that do not adopt stable native conformations.

we have developed an algorithm for the optimization of realistic peptide models  <cit>  of conformationally stable peptides. briefly, the algorithm comprises the following five steps:  an optional step of transplanting a given epitope onto suitable carrier peptides of known 3d-structure;  automated modeling of several point mutants using as templates the energetically most favorable or otherwise fittest peptides of the parent generation;  the molecular dynamics  of each point mutant in aqueous solution is simulated over a time of the order of  <dig> ns with a classical all-atom force field in explicit solvent;  extraction of fitness values from each trajectory;  selection of fittest individuals. the algorithm iterates over steps - an arbitrary number of times. to test algorithm and model we proposed the following computational experiment  <cit> : first a sequence of the well-characterized conformationally stable peptide villin headpiece   <cit>  was perturbed by a point mutation that is expected to strongly destabilize the native vh structure by destroying its small hydrophobic core. if we subject this mutated peptide to our optimization algorithm with objective functions chosen to be compatible with the native structure , then the algorithm could recover the more stable native sequence of vh. in fact, the algorithm generated several mutants that, according to our computational results, should be even more stable than wild-type vh. as an example we have recently identified in silico the point mutant g34l  <cit> .

here we investigate how the algorithm explores the space spanned by amino acid sequences and the two objective functions global stability and accessibility of an epitope loop. to this end we analyze data from the sequence perturbation experiment introduced above, where we had performed two evolutionary optimization runs. our results suggest that there could indeed be a considerable number of conformationally stable mutant peptides that may, in addition, fulfill other functionally related criteria. we present in vitro data on the structure and stability of the g34l mutant, where we find good agreement between computational prediction and experimental test.

RESULTS
evolutionary optimization
we have perturbed the sequence of vh by mutation f18k . f <dig> stabilizes the native conformation, and even a relatively conservative mutation such as f18l destabilizes the fold  <cit> . we have introduced f18k, a much more drastic mutation that replaces the bulky hydrophobic side chain of phe by the long, flexible, and positively charged side chain of lys. visual inspection of the wild-type 3d-structure  <cit>  suggested that mutation f18k should strongly destabilize the native fold as it removes the phenyl ring of f <dig> from the small hydrophobic core of the peptide and replaces it by the positively charged side chain of lys with no compensating negative charge nearby. in fact, in a md simulation the mutant structure fell apart quickly.

starting from f18k, the peptide sequence was then optimized with respect to two objective functions :  the conformational stability σ of the peptide,  a quantity α related to the solvent accessible surface of an "epitope loop" comprising residues 12– <dig>  these two objectives were chosen because they capture peptide properties that are often desired in practical applications. specifically, maximization of conformational stability σ is important as it improves resistance against peptidases, and leads to well defined binding sites and thus lower entropical penalties on binding. in contrast to σ, which quantifies a global feature of a peptide, the objective function α describes a local aspect of the binding site, namely the negative root mean square deviation  of residue-wise solvent accessible surfaces along the epitope loop between some target conformation and the peptide conformations generated in the course of the evolutionary optimization.  maximization of α is necessary to make sure that the binding face is exposed to a putative binding partner to the same extent as in a target conformation. note that maximization of α will in general not be sufficient to drive the epitope loop towards some target conformation; this could be achieved by introducing a conformational rmsd of the epitope loop as third objective function. in this proof-of-concept study we have restricted the number of objective functions to two in order to facilitate data analysis.

pareto-optimization should maximize both objective functions simultaneously towards their theoretical maximum values of σmax =  <dig> and αmax =  <dig>  respectively. this maximization is effected by using pareto-dominance  <cit>  as fitness criterion in the evolutionary optimization: the fitness values of non-dominated peptides are higher than those of dominated peptides.  > σ ^ α > α.)

the two evolutionary optimization runs started from the same f18k mutant structure modeled in silico but with different random seeds. in each of the runs we produced  <dig> generations of peptides, each generation comprising  <dig> individual sequences and their respective structures. as evolutionary operation solely point mutations were applied to peptide sequences of the previous generation, so that the maximum number of sequence differences generated in the runs is  <dig> with respect to the initial f18k mutant, or  <dig> to the wild-type vh. due to the costly fitness function the total computational expense was of the order of  <dig> year of cpu time.

the dynamics of the peptides in sequence space is visualized in fig.  <dig> and fig.  <dig> by showing the percentage π of identities in optimal sequence pair alignments between any two sequences i, j generated in run  <dig>  and  <dig> . the maximum value of π is  <dig> and means that both sequences are identical. the theoretical minimum value of  <dig> cannot be reached because of the conserved epitope loop .

it can be seen in fig.  <dig> and fig.  <dig> that both runs start from a set of highly similar sequences. however, then the development becomes distinct between the runs.

in run  <dig> the population becomes slowly and steadily more diverse. in generation  <dig> at the end of the run π varies between about  <dig> and  <dig> within that generation , which means that the sequences within that generation can differ at up to  <dig> sequence positions. with respect to the initial sequence, the sequences have π values of about  <dig> to  <dig> , corresponding to about  <dig> to  <dig> mutations. hence, the population seems to spread out from the initial sequence in different directions in sequence space.

in run  <dig> diversity first develops more quickly and culminates in generation  <dig>  towards the end of the run the intra-generation diversity decreases again to π values of above  <dig>  with one outlier individual having a π of approximately  <dig> to the other individuals in generation  <dig>  remarkably, the intra-generation diversity at both start and end are low , while the difference between first and last generation are higher . this means that after  <dig> generations the whole population has settled in a region of sequence space different from the initial region. overall, in the second run p remains in a more narrow range between about  <dig> and  <dig> 

the evolution in sequence space described above is the result of point mutations and selections according to pareto-dominance with respect to σ and α. consequently, the pareto-front defined by the non-dominated individuals shifts to the right to higher values of α, and upwards to the maximum σ =  <dig> in both runs .

the data from objective functions and sequence space is summarized in fig.  <dig>  it displays  values of all individuals from both runs and simultaneously, indicated by the plot symbols, the numbers of mutations with respect to the native vh sequence. the figure refers back to the initial hypothesis that there may exist many more peptides that fulfill certain criteria, including conformational stability. in fact, the figure shows that there are about a dozen sequences with  <dig> to  <dig> mutations and σ ≈  <dig>  and that some of these also have α values of up to - <dig> .

the picture changes above about σ =  <dig> . in a transition region of σ values between about  <dig>  and  <dig> , the density of individuals is reduced, and a gap opens between α values of - <dig> and - <dig>  for high σ values the density increases again while the gap along the α axis persists, so that for maximum stabilities of σ ≈  <dig> we have two well-separated groups with α < - <dig> and α > - <dig>  respectively.

the fact that in fig.  <dig> there is an accumulation of individuals at high σ values seems to support our initial hypothesis. note that it is not possible to conclude from the number of points in a certain region of the  plane to numbers of individual peptides in that region, because sequences may have been sampled several times. however, the correction for this multi-sampling does not affect the overall picture .

after the correction, there are nine sequences with a σ value of exactly  <dig>  i.e. they form stable conformations according to the criterion described in the methods section. these nine individuals are the most interesting members of the pareto-front since they promise not only high stability but also well-defined structure and surface exposure of the epitope loop. five of these individuals come from run  <dig> and in fig.  <dig> are located right of the α gap . of the remaining four stable individuals, three are from run  <dig> and one is from run 1; all four individuals in fig.  <dig> are left of the α gap . we have compared these nine individuals with respect to sequence and structure, including in the comparison also the wild-type vh sequence and structure as tenth individual; all ten individuals are provided as supplementary material .

all ten sequences are shown in a multiple sequence alignment in fig.  <dig>  the alignment shows that the sequences can be roughly grouped in two clusters, a non-native one , and a native one  that includes wildtype vh . the main features distinguishing non-native and native cluster cluster are a vs. d at position  <dig>  e vs. w at position  <dig>  and as largest difference a strictly conserved ayw motif at 32– <dig> in the non-native cluster that replaces a motif with consensus sequence ekg in the native cluster. another notable feature concerns the initial perturbation k18: most of the sequences retain this k, especially all sequences in the non-native cluster.

fig.  <dig> shows quantitatively by pairwise comparisons that the individuals not only cluster in sequence space, but also show the same clustering in terms of 3d-structure. the two clusters are clearly separated with cα rmsd values of below 3Å within each cluster and 6–8Å between the clusters. overall, sequences follow an analogous pattern , though one of the individuals  from the native vh cluster has a sequence that seems to be roughly equidistant to both clusters in sequence space.

the two clusters correlate perfectly with the two groups left and right of the α gap, respectively, in fig.  <dig>  with the native cluster on the left and the non-native cluster on the right of the gap. it may be surprising that the α-values in the native-like cluster are lower than those in the non-native cluster. the reason for this is that the reference structure for the computation of α according to eq.  <dig> is the experimental native structure  <cit>  and not the native structure relaxed in force field simulations without experimental constraints. this relaxation leads to a shift of α in the native cluster to values below - <dig>  accordingly, the structures left of the α gap with α values around - <dig> have structures similar to the relaxed native vh structure.

the other cluster  is remarkable since it combines maximum σ, increased α values, and non-native structure. the superposition with the native vh fold in fig.  <dig> shows that in the non-native cluster the n-terminal helix is tilted, the middle helix is almost dissolved into a number of turns, the c-terminal helix is shortened and tilted, and the c-terminal loop moves into the core. nevertheless, as visible in fig.  <dig>  the global topology of the new fold is still related to that of the native vh. hence, it may be appropriate to speak of the two clusters as of two sub-folds of the vh fold.

all structures in the non-native cluster show the internalized c-terminal loop, the a32y33w <dig> sequence feature mentioned above, and k <dig>  in fact the internalized part mainly comprises this ayw motif and allows the formation of a hydrophobic cluster integrating also the aliphatic part of the sidechain of k <dig>  the amino-tip of the latter is always exposed to the solvent, while in most of the non-native structures, the aliphatic part of k <dig> forms a broad contact with the aromatic ring of y <dig> .

another structural rearrangement accompanying the integration of the c-terminal loop into the core is the move of the n-terminus . in the native fold, the position of the n-terminus may be stabilized by a salt-bridge between d <dig> and r <dig>  the cβ-distance lies at 4– <dig> Å in our models, and our experimental data  supports that the locations of both sidechains allow a salt-bridge. as described above, we have in all non-native sequences at position  <dig> an alanine so that a salt-bridge to r <dig> is no longer possible. this should facilitate large rearrangements of positions  <dig> and  <dig> without energetic penalties. this is consistent with the observed increase of the cβ-distance between residues  <dig> and  <dig> to 15– <dig> Å in the non-native fold models . after this large shift, the n-terminus forms part of clamp into which the c-terminal loop is embedded .

the third sequence feature that distinguishes native and non-native individuals is w vs. e at position  <dig>  the native w <dig> has been found experimentally to be important for interaction of vh with its natural binding partner f-actin  <cit> . visual inspection of the native structure of vh or the models of its homologs gives no indications why the structure of vh alone should be stabilized by w <dig>  on the other hand does inspection of our non-native models suggest that e <dig> could stabilize the short α-helix comprising residues 23– <dig> by providing a capping interaction  <cit>  with the n-terminus of this helix. this helix is also present in the natively folded models, and the fact that we do not see native models with e <dig> may be due to the stochastic nature of the sampling procedure.

there are also two structures in the native cluster  that have retained k <dig>  they have found a surprisingly simple solution of how to accommodate this residue without changing the fold. the sidechain of k <dig> is bent sharply so that this aliphatic turn roughly takes the place of the phenyl-ring of the native f <dig> in the hydrophobic core, while the amino group is again exposed at the surface .

the first structure with σ =  <dig> that we have encountered in our study was indeed a revertant  that reintroduced the native f18; but even this individual differs from the wild-type vh by mutation g34l. it had been reported in ref.  <cit>  that the wild-type vh according to our stability criterion is quite stable but does not reach σ =  <dig>  in contrast, individual  <dig> has σ =  <dig>  and thus promised to have a higher stability while leaving the fold native. this prediction – native fold with higher stability – has prompted our first experimental test. results of this test are given in the experimental section below.

experimental results: 3d-structure and stability
the first peptide with σ =  <dig> generated in the evolutionary optimization was the point mutant g34l of wild-type vh. amongst all  <dig> single and double mutants only two  had this stability. in fig.  <dig> g34l can be easily identified since it is the only individual from run  <dig> in the group with σ =  <dig> and α < - <dig>  in fig.  <dig> and fig.  <dig> it corresponds to individual number  <dig>  according to the simulation the peptide belongs to the native vh sub-fold but has a higher stability than the native vh. to test these predictions we have carried out an experimental three-dimensional nmr structure determination together with denaturation experiments monitored by cd spectroscopy. details are given below and in the experimental part of the methods section.

for nmr structure determination, a total of  <dig> noe distance restraints obtained from the 2d noesy spectrum were used in the final structure calculations. these were distributed as  <dig> intra-residual restraints,  <dig> sequential restraints,  <dig> medium-range restraints , and  <dig> long-range restraints . in addition,  <dig> Φ and  <dig> Ψ angle restraints were obtained from an analysis of the 1h secondary chemical shifts. based on these experimental restraints, structures were calculated using a simulated annealing protocol in the program cns  <cit>  and the best structures in terms of total energy were selected for further analysis. in agreement with the prediction, the analysis of the experimentally solved structures shows that the molecule folds into one stable globular domain that consists of three α-helices. helices h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> comprise residues asp <dig> to phe <dig>  arg <dig> to ala <dig>  and leu <dig> to glu <dig>  respectively. fig. 7a shows the experimental structure possessing the lowest total energy in a ribbon representation. an overlay of five of the final solution structures is shown in fig. 7b. in the set of ten selected final solution structures the average rmsd value to the mean structure amounts to  <dig>  Å for the cα atoms. the experimental structure with the lowest total energy is compared in fig. 7c with the predicted structure shown in green. the average pairwise rmsd value between the model structure and the ten selected final nmr structures is  <dig>  Å. it is clear that both model and experimental nmr structure display the same global fold, while minor differences can be observed for the regular secondary structure elements; especially the second α-helix has a slightly different orientation in the model structure compared to the nmr structures.

one reliable way to test the agreement between experimental data and a three-dimensional structure is to back-calculate the experimental data from the trial structure and then to compare simulated and experimental data. we have been using for this purpose the auremol module relax  <cit> . to check the agreement of our model structure with the experimental 2d noesy spectrum, its spectrum was back-calculated based on the predicted structure of g34l and the experimental resonance line assignment. as an example two corresponding sections of these spectra are displayed in fig. 8a with the experimental spectrum on the left and the simulated spectrum on the right. both sections correspond to the n-terminal amino acids ser <dig>  asp <dig>  and phe <dig>  the two sections are virtually identical indicating that the model structure fits the experimental data very well for these residues. in general the comparison of the experimental and simulated data indicates similarly to the comparison of the corresponding structures that the predicted structure is fairly close to the experimental data. however, it should be noted that the results also indicate that the orientations of several side-chains such as phe  <dig> differ between model and experimental data  for example in the simulated spectrum an interaction between hb <dig>  <dig> and hd  <dig> is visible while this interaction is missing in the experimental spectrum. in this context, one has to consider that even the stable peptides with σ =  <dig> still can have some conformational flexibility, especially in the less well ordered loop regions, and what one observes in solution with nmr spectroscopy is an ensemble average. a single model structure as it was used for the data simulation can only represent one of many possible sub-states present in solution. recently a high resolution x-ray structure of the wild-type vh has been published  <cit> . in fig. 7d the predicted structure  is compared to both the x-ray structure  and the best nmr structure in terms of total energy . obviously, all three molecules adopt the same three-dimensional fold, and the limits of the regular secondary structure elements are almost identical.

the stability of the peptide was experimentally determined from guhcl denaturation experiments monitored with cd spectroscopy. fig.  <dig> shows the linear extrapolation of the Δg values determined in the transition region to  <dig> m guhcl, giving a value of  <dig>  kj/mol. to allow a comparison with previously obtained data for the corresponding wild-type peptide, measurements were performed under similar conditions and also similar methods for data evaluation were used as described previously  <cit> .

the experimentally determined Δg value of  <dig>  kj/mol  for the vh-mutant g34l is similar to the previously determined Δg values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kcal/mol obtained in h2o and d2o, respectively, for the wild-type peptide  <cit> .

our experimental data on structure and stability indicate that the in silico predictions are essentially correct with respect to the g34l mutant, namely that the structure of the peptide is not perturbed by this mutation but rather stabilized.

discussion
we have presented results on evolutionary in silico optimization of peptides with respect to two objective functions, including conformational stability. the optimization method is conceptually simple but computationally demanding due to the detailed modeling of the biomolecular system with classical all-atom force fields. this level of detail was chosen to allow for direct comparison with experiment, as shown above.

despite the fact that classical force fields have proven their usefulness in numerous applications, they are not perfect. as we are performing extended molecular dynamics simulations, imperfections of the force field model may well influence conformational distributions  <cit> . moreover, our simple single molecule model does neglect other factors that are important in experiments, such as the propensity to aggregate. nevertheless, we think that the model is sufficiently peptide-like to allow conclusions from evolutionary optimization runs to real peptides.

with the high computational demands of the molecular model, efficiency is an important aspect. in view of the wide spread and seemingly erratic movements of objective function values  one may ask whether a simple random sampling of mutations may have led to similar results. we have tested this and found a maximum stability of  <dig>  in such runs, i.e. with the same use of cpu time, random single mutations did not generate any stable individual . given the large size of sequence space, this is not surprising and does not contradict our hypothesis that there exist many islands of stability. we think that these islands are probably surrounded by a much larger sea of instability. this picture was also one of the reasons why we have avoided more complex evolutionary operators such as cross-over that potentially permit hopping between islands. the other reason was that the larger changes brought about by these operators would be difficult to relax during molecular dynamics simulations of acceptable lengths. however, we are exploring other options, e.g. double mutations with their potential to mutually compensate deleterious effects on stability while changing other fitness terms of the molecule.

a point to consider is the danger of generating individuals that are kinetically trapped in meta-stable conformations. we think that the fact that we see stability in both native and non-native group, each comprising four to five individuals, tested for stability in as many independent simulations, backs the assertion that these conformations are not kinetically trapped. this has been further supported by several longer independent md simulations in which the predicted structures have remained stable. nevertheless, we will analyse their energy landscape further with suitable methods  <cit>  and try to determine their structures in vitro.

the results evoke new questions, for instance whether the sub-folds are necessarily isolated or whether there may exist bridges between some of them. optimization algorithms such as the presented one could also be applied to find peptides that switch between sub-folds, depending on temperature, ph, or other conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
for the exploration of sequence-structure space of peptides we have used evolutionary pareto-optimization, exploring sequence space with point mutations and evaluating proposed sequences with a computationally intensive, realistic model. a first in vitro test of computational results has supported the viability of the method. the application of the method to a perturbed sequence of the conformationally stable villin headpiece peptide generated two clearly distinguishable, stably folding clusters or sub-folds of peptides, each populated by several sequences: a native villin headpiece sub-fold, and a distorted sub-fold with a similar global topology. since it is unlikely that villin headpiece is the only stable peptide that follows this pattern, we conclude that sub-folds could be a common fine-structure of the peptide fold-space, and that many undiscovered stably folding peptides may exist.
