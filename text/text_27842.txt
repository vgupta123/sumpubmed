BACKGROUND
understanding factors affecting susceptibility to infectious disease is the goal of many branches of the biological sciences. for the evolutionary biologist, these factors include the forces of mutation, gene flow, recombination, drift and selection and how these processes have shaped, and are currently shaping, genetic variation contributing to susceptibility to parasites and pathogens. the continued maintenance of genetic variation for disease resistance present in most populations  <cit>  poses an evolutionary problem; why, in the face of often strong pathogen mediated selection pressures, does disease susceptibility persist?

one hypothetical solution to this problem is that the rapid generation times of pathogens may provide them an evolutionary advantage over the host. furthermore, for longstanding pathogen-host interactions, cycles of pathogen adaptation and host counter-adaptation may promote the rapid evolution of genes involved in defense and the maintenance of host polymorphisms through frequency dependent selection  <cit> .

in addition to the assumed advantage of pathogens over their hosts, and potential pathogen-host coevolution, evolutionary and ecological immunologists have more recently begun to consider the consequences of the host life history on patterns of disease susceptibility  <cit> . the allocation of limited resources among fitness traits is a basic tenet of life history theory  <cit> , and implicit in recognizing pathogen defense as an important fitness component is the understanding that if this defense is costly, the best genotype may not be the most resistant to disease, but the genotype making the best compromise with other fitness components such as growth, somatic maintenance and reproduction. models of the pathogen-host interaction incorporating such costs suggest populations experience higher levels of disease susceptibility than would be seen if defenses were cost free  <cit> .

pathogen defense is a multifaceted trait, including behavioral, morphological and physiological components  <cit> . however, the outcome of the pathogen/host interaction often involves the immune system due to its specific role in combating potential pathogens that evade other defenses. because of the central role of immune function in pathogen defense, resistance costs are often referred to as the costs of immunity.

the immune system of insects, while lacking the combinatorial specificity and antigenic memory characteristic of vertebrate immune function, is an effective mechanism of immunological defense providing protection against a wide variety of potential pathogens of bacterial, fungal, viral and multicellular parasitic origins. drosophila melanogaster is a model system for much of our understanding of both constitutively expressed and inducible immune mechanisms including antimicrobial peptide production, phagocytosis of potential pathogens by insect hemocytes, the melanization reaction and encapsulation  <cit> .

but what are the costs of immunity? first, we must distinguish between maintenance costs and deployment costs, and second, whether these costs are physiological or evolutionary  <cit> . maintenance costs arise as a consequence of the investment of energy and resources into the infrastructure of an immune system and ongoing immunological surveillance and maintenance in the absence of infection. such costs might arise if developing the organs necessary for immune surveillance, the maintenance of populations of cells necessary for immunity, or the production of constitutively expressed prophylactic measures including lysozyme and antimicrobial peptides, make energy and resources less available to other fitness promoting traits. deployment costs arise from mounting an immune response. such costs may be due to the utilization of energy or resources or as a consequence of immunopathology  associated with induction of an immune response. indeed, models of the evolution of inducible defense require some cost, otherwise we would expect the constitutive expression of these defense mechanisms  <cit> .

a second distinction must be made between physiological costs and evolutionary costs. physiological costs are evaluated either by examining the phenotypic correlation between fitness traits or through experimental manipulation. for example, the experimental manipulation of male sexual activity results in a decline in their immune function, consistent with the hypothesis that the maintenance of an immune system carries some physiological cost  <cit> . physiological costs of immunological deployment are evaluated as changes in fitness following experimental immunological challenge. the ease of inducing an immune response has prompted a number of experimental studies demonstrating physiological costs of immunological deployment  <cit> .

evolutionary costs imply an underlying genetic basis to the observed cost and are evolutionary in the sense that they may act as brakes retarding the response to selection for immune efficacy. evolutionary costs of immunological maintenance are revealed as negative genetic correlations between immunocompetence and the expression of other fitness components in the absence of infection  <cit> . in d. melanogaster, for example, experimental evolution of resistance to the parasitoid wasps leptopilina boulardi and asobara tabida revealed a genetic trade-off with larval competitive ability in crowded larval conditions  <cit> .

evolutionary costs of deployment indicate that genotypes vary in cost of immune system induction. such costs would be revealed either as a significant genotype-by-immune challenge interaction when comparing fitness traits in immune challenged versus unchallenged individuals or by demonstrating that costs of deployment are exaggerated as a consequence of selection on immune system function. there are no previous attempts to evaluate evolutionary costs of immunological deployment. in d. melanogaster immunological defense against the parasitoid asobara tabida caused declines in desiccation and starvation resistance and the magnitude of this cost varied among iso-female lines  <cit> , however, in this study it is impossible to distinguish immunological costs from costs associated with parasitism.

environmental variation is known to affect the appearance and magnitude of both physiological and evolutionary costs of immunity. for example, reduced larval competitiveness in parasitoid-resistant d. melanogaster was only revealed in a highly competitive environment  <cit> , while in bumblebees the costs of immune system activation were only apparent if workers were starved  <cit> . in general, environmental variation may affect condition and thus the amount of resource that can be allocated among various traits  <cit> . furthermore, changes in genetic architecture are expected with environmental variation, affecting both the heritability of traits and the patterns of correlation between traits  <cit> . in particular, differences in the environmental lability of traits, affecting the extent of genotype-by-environment  interaction, are likely to influence the genetic correlation  <cit> .

in this experiment we isolated  <dig> hemiclones from a natural population of d. melanogaster and used them to estimate the evolutionary costs of immunological maintenance and deployment under both food-limited and food-unlimited environmental conditions. we evaluated maintenance costs as the genetic correlation between fecundity in the absence of infection and resistance to an experimental infection with the bacterium providencia rettgeri. we estimated deployment costs as the change in fecundity following infection with live bacteria or heat-killed bacteria in comparison with both sterile wounding and uninjected controls. our results indicate the presence of maintenance costs, but that these costs can be wholly mitigated in an environment in which food resources are not limiting. we also detected deployment costs, but as with maintenance costs, the decline in fecundity due to immune challenge was condition dependent.

RESULTS
the final data set included counts of  <dig>  vials totaling  <dig>  emerging offspring, colony counts of p. rettgeri from  <dig> plates, and the dry weight of  <dig>  females. because of a labeling error, data for  <dig> of the hemiclone lines is missing from the fourth block of the experiment. otherwise, sources of departure from the balanced design were random with respect to hemiclone line.

analysis of the cost of maintenance
female fecundity in the absence of infection , resistance to p. rettgeri, dry weight at emergence, dry weight at day  <dig>  and the change in dry weight from emergence to day  <dig> are included in the analysis of maintenance costs. hemiclone lines varied for all of these traits in both environments .

d cvr – residual coefficient of variation. based on restricted maximum likelihood estimators.

as expected, females in yeast-unlimited vials were more fecund than females in standard vials where yeast was limiting . additionally, there was a strong genotype-by-environment  interaction for fecundity . we estimated heritability and coefficients of variation for each environment separately. in the yeast-limited environment, the heritability of fecundity  was just less than half that seen in the yeast-unlimited environment . estimates of the coefficient of additive variation for fecundity in each environment were very similar, while the residual variation  in the yeast-limited environment was almost twice that observed in the yeast-unlimited environment .

while hemiclones varied in their ability to slow the growth of the experimental infection of p. rettgeri, there was no effect of diet and no diet × hemiclone line  interaction . estimates of the heritability and additive and residual coefficients of variation for immune defense were similar for both environments .

hemiclone lines varied in their dry weight at emergence, dry weight at day  <dig> post emergence and for the change in weight. estimates of dry weight for females at day  <dig> post-emergence  were based on uninjected females. the heritabilities of dry weight at emergence and dry weight at day  <dig>  were all very similar, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . as expected, females provided the yeast-unlimited diet were heavier than females in yeast-limited vials. however, females in both environments gained weight over the course of the experiment, reinforcing our assumption that the yeast-limited environment represented limiting, but not starvation, conditions. variation in weight gain also showed moderate levels of heritability . as with fecundity, there was evidence of a strong gxe interaction for female weight at day  <dig> post eclosion .

for all of the phenotypes, estimates of cva and cvr were similar for traits in the two environments. however, the residual variance tended to be higher in the yeast-limited environment for all of the phenotypes . among the phenotypes, both cva and cvr were much higher for bacterial load.

genetic correlations were based on the pearson product moment correlations of least-square hemiclone line means from the analyses described above. there was a strong, negative genetic correlation between fecundity and resistance in the yeast-limited environment . this correlation was absent in the yeast-unlimited environment . using fisher's z' transformation  <cit>  we found these two correlation coefficients were significantly different from each other .

no weight measure was significantly correlated with resistance . dry weight at day  <dig> was a significant predictor of fecundity in both environments .

* p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> .

weight at emergence did not correlate with subsequent fecundity in either environment . as expected, our various measures of weight were all highly correlated. interestingly, there were strong negative genetic correlations between weight at emergence and weight gain in both environments . multiple regression of hemiclone line means for fecundity on resistance, with each of the different measures of weight entered as covariates, revealed that the negative correlation between fecundity and resistance seen in the yeast-limited environment was independent of size variation .

shown are regression coefficients and associated p-values from multiple regressions of the line least-square means for fecundity and each size covariate onto resistance. interactions between fecundity and each covariate were not significant .

analysis of the cost of deployment
we analyzed the fecundity cost of immunological deployment using a contrast repeated measures anova. the response design matrix  for the contrast repeated measures anova compares the natural-log transformed fecundity in vial  <dig>  prior to injections, with natural-log transformed fecundity in vials  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> separately. an initial analysis revealed significant interactions between diet and hemiclone line  and a marginally significant interaction between diet and injection . we therefore split the analysis between the two dietary manipulations .

the response matrix  for the full model contrasts fecundity in vial  <dig>  with each subsequent vial. multivariate test statistics for the full model are based on approximate f-tests generated using roy's max root.

* p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> .

there was a strong effect of injection in the yeast-limited environment . this was mainly due to an approximate 10% decline in the fecundity of females in the first  <dig> hours after receiving an injection with either heat-killed bacteria or a sterile wound compared to the uninjected controls. in subsequent time periods the fecundity of females in the different injection treatments no longer differed .

focusing on changes in fecundity in the first  <dig> hours after injection, we used a set of a priori orthogonal contrasts to test for differences between live-bacteria injected and heat-killed bacteria injected females , between bacteria injected females and females injected with a sterile needle  and between females receiving an injection of any sort and uninjected females . in the yeast-limited environment, only c <dig> showed a decline in the fecundity of injected females compared to uninjected females  indicating significant costs of wounding that could not be distinguished from costs of immune system deployment or pathology associated with live bacteria.

as previously discussed, evolutionary costs of immunological deployment are revealed as a genotype-by-challenge interaction, indicating genetic variation for the physiological cost experienced. in the yeast-limited environment, this interaction was marginally significant . however, in the first  <dig> hours after injection, when the cost was realized, the interaction was not significant . in order to examine the hypothesis more closely, we combined data across the three injection groups  and compared the fecundity of injected females to the fecundity of uninjected females in the first  <dig> hours after injection. again, however, there was no indication of genetic variation in the cost experienced .

the analysis was split between the two diets. tabular entries are f-tests for a model comparing the natural-log transformed fecundity in vial  <dig>  with the natural-log transformed fecundity in vial  <dig> .

injection treatment also had an effect in the yeast-unlimited environment , although much less pronounced than that seen in the yeast-limited environment. however, unlike the situation in the yeast-limited environment, the effect was due primarily to the decline in fecundity in females receiving an injection with heat-killed bacteria, who showed a marginally significant decline compared to sterile-needle injected females  and a trend toward a significant decline compared to the uninjected females . there was no difference between sterile wounded females and uninjected females . once again, the source of this effect was a difference apparent in the first day after injection, where females receiving an injection with heat-killed bacteria showed a strong decline in fecundity compared to both sterile wounded and uninjected females while sterile wounded and uninjected females were statistically indistinguishable . comparisons of pre-injection fecundity with fecundity at later time points did show a trend for females receiving an injection with heat-killed bacteria to have lower fecundity than both sterile wound and uninjected controls, but in no case was the main effect of injection significant .

fecundity in the yeast-unlimited environment in the first  <dig> hours after injection was analyzed in the same manner as described for the yeast-limited environment . again fecundity varied on the basis of injection treatment . examination of the a priori orthogonal contrasts showed no difference in the fecundity of females receiving injections with heat-killed bacteria versus injections with live bacteria . however, there was a decline in the fecundity of bacteria-injected females compared to sterile-needle injected controls . the effect seen in c <dig> makes the interpretation of the significance of the c <dig> comparison dubious. post-hoc examination of the means for the different injection groups indicated that change in fecundity of females receiving an injection of bacteria  was lower than for uninjected females  and that there was no difference between uninjected and sterile needle injected females .

once again, the line by injection interaction was marginally significant for the full model, but was not significant for the analysis of changes in fecundity in the first  <dig> hours after injection . to examine this hypothesis more closely we combined data for bacteria-injected females  and compared their fecundity to the combined data of the two controls . as in the yeast-limited environment, lines did not differ in the costs experienced : f <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

in terms of female dry weight at the end of the experiment, females receiving an injection  had a lower weight than the uninjected controls in both environments . the line × injection interaction, indicative of an evolutionary cost of deployment, was significant in the yeast-unlimited environment, and trended towards significance in the yeast-limited environment .

shown are f-statistics for each factor with corresponding p-values in parentheses.

discussion
the evolutionary cost of immunological maintenance
the experimental manipulation of yeast availability had a predictably large effect on female fecundity, with females in the yeast-unlimited environment  having over  <dig>  times more offspring than females in the yeast-limited environment . previous studies in drosophila and other insect species have repeatedly shown an association between fecundity and the nutritional status of females  <cit> . females in yeast-limited vials were not starving as evidenced by the gain in dry weight from emergence to the end of the experiment  <dig> days later . of course weight gain was also observed in females on the yeast-unlimited diet, and by the end of the experiment these females weighed  <dig> % more than females on the yeast-limited diet.

the dietary manipulation leads to strong genotype-by-environment interactions for both fecundity and dry weight at day  <dig> . the inter-environmental genetic correlation for trait values across the two environments indicates that a shared set of genes contributes to variation in these traits in both environments . nevertheless, the significant genotype-by-environment interaction for both of these traits suggests fundamental differences in genetic architecture across this environmental gradient. such an effect could arise if, for example, polymorphism in genes involved in resource acquisition had different effects on fecundity in the two environments, . alternatively, the hormonal response to different food availabilities  <cit>  could lead to differences in the set of genes expressed in the two environments, thereby unmasking independent sources of genetic variation.

unlike fecundity and adult dry weight, there was no discernable effect of the environmental manipulation on immune function. estimates of the number of bacteria recovered were nearly identical  and there was no genotype-by-environment interaction . it is surprising that diet did not affect immune function given that a previous study, with a similar manipulation of food availability, found that females with ad libitum access to dietary yeast had dramatically improved immunity compared to females on a yeast-limited diet  <cit> .

this study differed in  <dig> ways that could potentially cause the disparity in outcomes. first, the studies used flies from different populations. however, given that there is little genetic differentiation among north american populations of d. melanogaster  <cit>  this does not seem a satisfactory explanation for the dramatically different outcomes. a second difference is that mckean and nunney  looked at the clearance of non-pathogenic bacteria, e. coli, rather than the ability to slow the growth of a pathogenic bacterium. this also seems wanting as an explanation as the slower clearance of e. coli for females on the yeast-limited diet was mirrored by a more rapid death from an experimental infection with pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> .

a third explanation, and the one that seems most likely, is that there are differences in the conditions actually represented by the environmental manipulation performed. the 'standard' yeast-limiting vials used in this study were made with agar-dextrose-yeast media while in the study of mckean and nunney  standard, yeast-limiting vials were made with agar-cornmeal-molasses. in both studies it seems likely that the yeast-supplemented vials represented ad lib food conditions. however, it appears that the low food environment in the study of mckean and nunney  may have represented a greater limitation for females than in the present study. in support of this hypothesis, the fecundity of females in yeast-unlimited condition in mckean and nunney  was  <dig>  times that of the yeast-limiting condition, compared to only a  <dig>  fold increase seen in the present study. the results of mckean and nunney , utilizing the agar-cornmeal-molasses food, have recently been replicated  suggesting that the effect of food availability on patterns of immune function is a threshold trait, and that past a certain level of food availability further improvements in immune function do not occur.

our analysis revealed heritable variation for each of the phenotypes assayed. these heritability estimates represent the upper bound of estimates of the narrow sense heritability  <cit> . there are three potential sources of confounding variation that could inflate our estimate of the additive genetic variance. the first two arise as a consequence of how we sampled test females from the hemiclone families and the third is particular to using the clone-generator system for estimating the breeding values.

due to the very large number of flies needed for this experiment , we did not attempt to precisely control the larval density or to keep track of the source of maternal chromosomes. it seems unlikely that variation in larval density would inflate our estimate of the additive variance. the numbers of females laying eggs in the collection vials was quite low and because the females in these vials were fully wild-type, variation among vials in the density of eggs laid is expected to be random with respect to hemiclone genotype. it also seems unlikely that our estimate of the additive variance is inflated by the confounding of non-additive genetic variance arising from a pervasive sampling of full sibs, in violation of our assumption that test females were almost exclusively composed of half-sibs. the test females used within each block of the experiment are the offspring of  <dig> randomly sampled females from our base population . assuming an equal contribution of daughters from each female, the probability that two randomly sampled test females within a particular test vial of  <dig> females are not full sibs is  <dig> . therefore, it is not likely that estimates of the additive variance are inflated due to violation of the half-sib assumption.

a third source of deviation from more standard quantitative genetic designs is unique to the clone-generator system itself  <cit> . the experimental design used here gives an estimate of the breeding value of a gamete, while a half-sib design provides estimates based on the breeding value of an individual  <cit> . for a species like d. melanogaster, where there is no recombination in males, the breeding value of a gamete could differ from the breeding value of an individual male if there are strong epistatic interactions between allelic variants at loci on different chromosomes  <cit> . however, since only  <dig> chromosomes make up almost 99% of the genic content in d. melanogaster, it is unlikely that such non-additive effects would inflate the additive variance. furthermore, the present design is very similar to other quantitative genetic designs in d. melanogaster utilizing balancer chromosomes  or crossing designs  using highly inbred lines.

our estimates for the heritability of fecundity, immunity and dry weight in the two environmental conditions  are consistent with expectations from previous studies of life history traits  <cit> . life history traits tend to exhibit lower heritability than morphological traits presumably because life history traits experience strong selection  <cit>  although there are other explanations  <cit> .

houle  <cit>  has argued that a more appropriate measure of genetic variation is the mean standardized additive variance, the coefficient of additive variation, cva, rather than the heritability. in general, the low heritability of life history traits, such as fecundity, appears to arise from a greater residual variation rather than an absolute reduction in the additive genetic variance. such an effect seems to explain why we see such a low estimate for the heritability of fecundity in the yeast-limited environment  compared to the yeast-unlimited environment ; a comparison of cva shows they are similar in the two environments, however, the cvr in the yeast-limited environment is twice that seen in the yeast-unlimited environment .

our estimates for the heritability of the ability to slow the growth of p. rettgeri  are much lower than those reported for immune-related traits in other insect species. for example, in the field cricket, teleogryllus oceanicus, the heritability of encapsulation response  and hemocyte load  are more than three times as high as our estimates of resistance to p. rettgeri in the yeast-limited  and yeast-unlimited environment . similar observations of very high levels of heritability have been reported for the caterpillar spodoptera littoralis  activity: h <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; encapsulation: h <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>   <cit> ), in the egyptian cotton leafworm , and in the yellow dung fly .

the exact origin of such profound differences in the magnitude of the heritability estimates is unclear. one possibility is that functional measures of the effectiveness of an immune response may be quite different than measures of single effectors or components of the immune response  <cit> . for example, the ability to slow the growth of a pathogenic bacterial population is likely a multifaceted interaction between various mechanisms of host defense and particular virulence mechanisms possessed by the bacteria. if interactions among the various components of the immune response contribute a large amount of epistatic variance, or if environmental variation affecting each component of the response combines to increase the total variance in the functional outcome, then this could reduce the heritability of functional response even though each component may show high levels of heritability. consistent with this hypothesis, the heritability of the melanization response to sephadex beads in the mosquito anopholes gambiae was much greater than observed for resistance to e. coli  <cit> .

evolutionary costs of immunological maintenance are revealed as negative genetic correlations between fitness components in the absence of infection and immune system function  <cit> . our results clearly indicate the presence of such costs, but that their expression is condition dependent. in a nutritional environment in which food is limiting, there was a strong negative genetic correlation between female fecundity and resistance to the bacterial infection . however, as the nutritional environment improved, this trade-off was no longer present . in fact, the two correlation coefficients are significantly different from each other  indicating a significant genotype-by-environment interaction for the genetic correlation  <cit> . such results indicate that predicted evolutionary trajectories based on estimates obtained in only one environment may be highly misleading. in this case, all else being equal, correlated effects on fecundity may slow the short-term response to selection for resistance only when food is limiting, while if food were not limiting, these traits would be predicted to evolve independently.

the effect of environmental variation on evolutionary costs of immunological maintenance has also been observed in lines of d. melanogaster selected for increased resistance to the larval parasitoids asobara tabida or leptipolina boulardi  <cit> . these results illustrate the importance of considering multiple ecologically relevant environments when estimating patterns of genetic variance and covariance of life history traits, including immune function  <cit> .

the costs of immunological deployment
an immunological cost of deployment is recognized as a reduction in fitness as a consequence of immune system activation  <cit> . the analysis of immunological deployment costs can focus on physiological costs, , or evolutionary  costs, . there is a growing literature on studies examining the physiological costs of immune system activation  <cit> . indeed, the absence of deployment costs would be troubling, raising the question of why defense mechanisms are inducible and not simply constitutively expressed  <cit> . the evolutionary costs of immunological deployment have not been well studied.

the experimental design used here allows us to examine both the physiological and evolutionary costs of immunological deployment. our results suggest the presence of short-term physiological costs of deployment . the effect of the different injections on fecundity and female dry weight differed between the two environments, with a slight exaggeration of costs when females were under yeast-limited environmental conditions.

females in the yeast-limited environment were less fecund in the first  <dig> hours after injection, but fecundity returned to uninjected levels by  <dig> hours after infection . the decline in fecundity of females receiving an injection of bacteria  was similar to the decline observed for sterile-wound females, meaning that costs of wounding could not be distinguished from costs associated with the response to bacterial challenge . the wound response in d. melanogaster involves the production of antimicrobial peptides and the activation of enzyme cascades involved in wound repair. these induced responses to wounding could contribute to the observed fecundity cost. the cost could also arise as a consequence of physical damage. however, it would seem that physical damage would have longer-lasting effects on fecundity instead of the transitory effect observed here.

our results differ dramatically from those reported by zerofsky et al.  <cit> . in their study females were injected with a mixture of heat killed micrococcus luteus  and escherichia coli . the fecundity of these females was compared to sterile media injected controls. wild-type, immune intact, females experienced a significant and long lasting decline in fecundity  <cit> .

we suggest two hypotheses to explain the disparity in 1) distinguishing changes in fecundity in sterile-wound and bacteria injected females and 2) the lack of a long-term fecundity cost in this experiment. first, there was a tremendous difference in the amount of bacteria introduced to females in the  <dig> experiments. in the study of zerofsky et al.  <cit> , overnight cultures of m. luteus and e. coli were mixed, heat-killed, centrifuged and then the needle dipped into this highly concentrated pellet. we used solutions containing heat-killed bacteria diluted to an od <dig> ≈  <dig> , or live bacteria at a slightly lower concentration . the apparent active and rapid down-regulation of immune responses  <cit>  may mean that significant deployment costs are only observed following persistent immune system induction. second, the combined activation of both the toll and imd pathways  could produce longer-lasting costs. consistent with this is the observation that the e <dig>  relish mutants  did not experience a cost of deployment  <cit>  even though the toll pathway, presumably activated in response to the m. luteus, was intact.

we also observed a deployment cost in the yeast-unlimited environment, and as with the yeast-limited environment, this cost was short term, with fecundity returning to the level of uninjected controls within  <dig> hours. the unlimited access to dietary yeast affected both the magnitude and the type of cost experienced. first, the 5% decline in fecundity of bacteria-injected  females in the first  <dig> hours after infection was less than the 11% decline observed for similarly challenged females on the yeast-limited diet. second, in the yeast-unlimited environment a cost of immune system activation could be distinguished from a simple cost of wounding .

there are other examples of food availability affecting deployment costs and also the cost of parasitism itself. for example, in the bumble bee, bombus terrestris, the acceleration of mortality following challenges with lps and synthetic beads was only seen when bees were starved subsequent to the challenge and not in bees kept on a normal diet  <cit> . likewise, in spodoptera littoralis caterpillars immune function declined, but the cost of nucleopolyhedrovirus increased, as a consequence of manipulations of dietary protein levels  <cit> . however, ad libitum access to food does not appear to allow for complete mitigation of deployment costs as this and another study  <cit>  have demonstrated.

a physiological cost of deployment was also reflected in the decline in dry weight of females injected with heat-killed bacteria or given a sterile wound. this decline in weight was seen in both the yeast-limited environment, where there was a  <dig> % decline in dry weight, and in the yeast-unlimited environment where females exhibited a  <dig> % decline in weight compared to uninjected controls . this observation is interesting in light of work demonstrating a type of 'wasting' in flies following infection with mycobacterium marinum  <cit> . in that study, infection promoted a progressive loss of energy reserves and hyperglycemia as a consequence of hyperactivation of the transcription factor foxo. dionne et al.  <cit>  argued that the appearance of wasting was an unintended byproduct of a massive reallocation of energy reserves towards immune function. an alternative hypothesis is that the pathology arises as a consequence of the fitness promoting activities of the pathogen  <cit> . our results, indicating a decline in dry weight in females receiving either a sterile wound or heat-killed bacteria, are consistent with the energy reallocation hypothesis, although the role of injection-induced anorexia cannot be ruled out.

lastly, we did not find overwhelming evidence of evolutionary costs of immunological deployment. for fecundity, there were marginally significant hemiclone line by injection interactions for the full model in the contrast manova . however, when comparing changes in fecundity in the first  <dig> hours after the challenge  the interaction was not significant . dry weight did show a significant hemiclone line × injection interaction in the yeast-unlimited environment , and a marginally significant interaction in the yeast-limited environment .

only one previous study has examined the extent of genetic variation for the cost of immunological deployment, however in that study costs of immunity could not be distinguished from costs of parasitism  <cit> . our inability to demonstrate evolutionary costs of immunological deployment may reflect a lack of statistical power, however, the analysis suggests a rather small bound on the magnitude of evolutionary costs compared to the gxe interactions observed for fecundity and for the genetic correlation between fecundity and resistance. one explanation is that if immune responses are tightly regulated, as appears to be the case  <cit> , the extent of immune induction represented by the challenges represented in this study may be so rapidly down-regulated that genetic variation in this regulation is relatively unimportant. thus, a more substantial immunological challenge, or a series of smaller challenges, resulting in prolonged activation of the immune response, may uncover underlying genetic variation for deployment costs. furthermore, subtle evolutionary costs of deployment beyond the power of the present study could still be of evolutionary importance in the long term. at the very least, genetic variation for deployment costs must have existed in the past and it will be interesting in future research to explore whether such variation can be unmasked and the potential interaction between the evolutionary costs of deployment and the closely related phenomenon of tolerance  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the results presented here suggest that fitness costs of immunological maintenance and deployment may constrain populations from achieving high levels of resistance, especially in food-limited environments. in fact, in an environment in which individuals have ad libitum access to dietary yeast, our results suggest that selection for improved resistance to p. rettgeri could proceed independent of effects on fecundity, at least in the short term. our results emphasize the importance of examining costs in variable environments, and that food availability in particular is an important factor affecting patterns of genetic variation and correlation among fitness traits including immune system function.
