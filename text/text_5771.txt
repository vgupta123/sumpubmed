BACKGROUND
as sessile, photosynthetic organisms, plants are necessarily exposed to high levels of environmental stresses including uvb, gamma irradiation and heavy metals which increase somatic recombination frequencies in plants and their progeny  <cit> . in plants, repair of dna damage products is particularly important because somatic tissues give rise to germ cells at a relatively late stage in development, which means that mutations accumulating in somatic cells from the effects of environmental genotoxins can be passed onto the next generation of plants  <cit> . effective cellular response mechanisms have evolved to cope with dna damage including cell cycle delay or arrest and activation of dna repair pathways  <cit> .

dna ligases play essential roles in all organisms by maintaining the physical structure of dna. these enzymes seal gaps in the sugar-phosphate backbone of dna that arise during dna replication, dna damage and repair. in arabidopsis, as in other eukaryotes, the ligation reaction uses atp as a cofactor and the involvement of a covalent amp-ligase intermediate  <cit> . eukaryotes have evolved multiple dna ligase isoforms, with both specific and overlapping roles in the replication and repair of the nuclear and organellar genomes. dna ligase  <dig>  is present in all eukaryotes where it is required for joining dna fragments produced during dna replication. dna ligase  <dig> also plays important roles in dna single strand break  repair pathways in mammals and yeast. these pathways are less well characterised in plants, but orthologues of several ssb repair genes are identifiable in the genomes of higher plants  <cit> . lig <dig> is an essential gene with lethal knockout phenotypes in yeast, mammalian cells and arabidopsis  <cit> . whilst lig <dig> is essential for cell division in yeast and plants, mouse embryos are viable and develop until mid-term without lig <dig>  indicating that a second ligase may substitute for growth up to this point  <cit> . similarly, mouse cell lines deficient in lig <dig> are also viable, indicating that other dna ligase activities can substitute for lig <dig> in dna replication  <cit> . interestingly, although plants deficient in atlig <dig> are null, cell division in gametophytes prior to fertilisation appeared unaffected, suggesting that either that a second ligase can partially substitute for dna ligase  <dig>  or that ligase  <dig> levels in haploid cells are sufficient to support gametogenesis  <cit> .

dna ligase  <dig>  is also present in all eukaryotes and mediates the final step in the non-homologous end joining  pathway of dsb repair. however, there are clear differences between eukaryotes regarding the presence of other forms of dna ligase. plants lack a dna ligase iii  orthologue, which in mammals participates in base excision repair of the nuclear genome and also functions in the maintenance of the mitochondrial genome  <cit> . whilst yeast has two dna ligases , there are three dna ligase genes in arabidopsis thaliana, two of which  have been functionally characterised  <cit> . an additional third dna ligase unique to plants, termed ligase vi, has been cloned from rice and arabidopsis  <cit>  although the in planta function of this dna ligase remains to be determined.

in addition to the nuclear genome plants possess chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. atlig <dig> has been shown to be targeted to both the nucleus and the mitochondria  <cit> . this dual targeting is controlled via an evolutionarily conserved posttranscriptional mechanism that involves the use of alternative start codons to translate distinct ligase proteins from a single transcript.

whilst a role for arabidopsis lig <dig> in nhej is well established, the role of the other dna ligases in arabidopsis dna repair remains unclear. previous studies have demonstrated that lig <dig> is an essential gene in plants, consistent with a non-redundant role in nuclear dna replication  <cit> . however, the lethality of atlig <dig> mutations prevents analysis of the potential roles of this enzyme in dna repair processes in plants. to address this question, we created arabidopsis lines with reduced atlig <dig> levels which were sufficient to allow growth and development, but which produced plants which were potentially compromised in dna repair. analysis of these plants identified lines which exhibited growth defects and a reduced capacity for the repair of both ssbs and dsbs, providing evidence that atlig <dig> is involved in recombination pathways in higher plants. this has provided the first report of a role for atlig <dig> in dsb repair and identification of a novel dna dsb repair pathway in plants.

RESULTS
phenotypic analyses of dna ligase <dig> deficient plants
in the absence of viable knockout lines, arabidopsis plants with reduced levels of lig <dig> were generated using an rnai approach to gain further insight into gene function . both arabidopsis dna ligase  <dig>  transcript and protein levels in the silenced lines were determined by semi-quantitative rt-pcr and western blotting respectively . two lines with reduced levels of atlig <dig> protein were selected for further analysis and designated atlig1-rnaia and atlig1-rnaib. these plants displayed an approximate four-fold reduction in atlig <dig> protein , which although resulting in severe growth defects, was sufficient for propagation of these lines through to seed production.

lig1-deficient plants displayed a stunted and stressed phenotype  which became more pronounced with age. leaf and root growth were measured to quantify growth differences between atlig1-silenced lines and wild type plants. interestingly the lines with reduced atlig <dig> protein did not display any delay in germination . during the first one to two weeks growth roots were significantly smaller in the atlig1-rnaia compared to wild type or atlig1-rnaib plants .

a reduction in length and width of the third and fourth leaves became more pronounced with plant age in both silenced lines relative to wild type controls . by  <dig> days the average length of the third leaves was  <dig>  mm in atlig1-rnai lines as compared to a wild-type value of  <dig> mm . corresponding leaf widths were  <dig>  mm for the wild-type and significantly less for the rnai lines at  <dig> – <dig>  mm . the daily growth rate was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for wild-type,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for atlig1-rnaia and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for atlig1-rnaib line. the final size of mature arabidopsis leaves is a function of both cell division and cell expansion  <cit> . therefore, further investigation of the reduced organ size in the atlig1-rnai lines analysed cell size in protoplasts isolated from rosette leaves of wild type and silenced lines after four weeks growth. cell size was significantly reduced in the atlig1-rnai lines  with mean cell diameters of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the atlig1-rnaia and atlig1-rnaib lines respectively, compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in wild type plants. this 43% and 27% reduction in cell size of atlig1-rnaia and atlig1-rnaib plants respectively was not sufficient to explain the approximate 70% reduction in leaf length and 60% reduction in leaf width observed relative to wild type plants. this indicated that reduced cell number was also responsible for the decreased organ size in the atlig1-rnai lines.

the extent to which cells have undergone endoreduplication is an important factor in the determination of plant cell size  <cit> . flow cytometry was performed on the silenced and wild type plants to determine the ploidy levels of leaf cells. distinct peaks were observed with wild type and the atlig1-rnai lines, corresponding to 2c, 4c, 8c, 16c and 32c, with no significant difference between the wild type and lig <dig> depleted lines in terms of peak height . however, the atlig1-rnai lines both displayed an increase in cells between 2c and 4c indicative of slowed progression or arrest in s-phase. this is consistent with a requirement for atlig <dig> not only in dna replication and may also reflect impairment in dna repair pathways leading to compromised s-phase. normal endoreduplication in the atlig1-rnai lines was confirmed by the development of typical tricomes and a wild type-like etiolation response, both of which are compromised in mutants affecting the endocycle  <cit>  .

analysis of atlig1-rnai single strand break repair kinetics
single cell electrophoresis  assay under strictly neutral  or neutral with alkaline unwinding step  conditions quantifies the repair kinetics of double or single strand dna breaks respectively  <cit> . the comet assay was used here to investigate the kinetics of dna repair in atlig1-rnai lines compared to wild-type plants. dna single strand breaks were induced by mms treatment in ten-day old seedlings of wild type and atlig <dig> depleted lines, with a linear dose response curve up to  <dig> mm mms . background dna damage contributed around 20% dna comet tails in untreated  seedlings and 60% of comet tail dna after  <dig> hour treatment with  <dig> mm mms . the effects seen were similar in wild type and atlig1a lines . seedlings treated with  <dig> mm mms were analysed using the comet assay and the atlig1-rnai lines displayed reduced repair rates of induced dna ssb damage in comparison to wild-type with around 50% of damage remaining after  <dig> min in controls compared to 85% in atlig1-rnai plants . notably, atlig1-rnai plants, but not wild type controls, demonstrated an initial increase in ssb accumulation in the first  <dig> min of recovery following mms treatment . this may be attributable to the accumulation of ssbs arising from unrestricted removal of alkylated bases induced by mms in genomic dna and a delayed ligation step arising from the limited availability of dna ligase activity during base excision repair in the rnai line.

reduced rates of dna double strand break repair in atlig1-rnai lines
single cell electrophoresis under neutral conditions was used to analyse the repair of dna double strand breaks in the wild type and silenced lines. this analysis revealed similar levels of background  dna damage in all mutant and wild-type seedlings, with approximately 25% of dna migrating in the comet tail . this indicated there was no significant accumulation of dsbs in  <dig> day old seedlings deficient in atlig <dig> in the absence of genotoxin treatment. as differences in growth between wt and atlig <dig> deficient lines become more pronounced at around  <dig> days onwards, the effect of diminished levels of atlig <dig> on the long term growth and development of the plants may well be attributable to the accumulation of unrepaired damage.

the radiomimetic bleomycin  <cit>  causes dna double strand breaks in dna. a one hour treatment of the ten-day seedlings with the bleomycin  resulted in a large shift in the migration of the genomic dna with 60–80% migrating in the comet tail, indicative of extensive fragmentation, with atlig <dig> deficient and wild type plants displaying similar responses . most dsbs were removed within one hour of bleomycin treatment in wild type lines . the kinetics of dsb repair in mutant and wild type plants were then determined by the comet assay over a time course of recovery from bleomycin treatment, with the extent of dna damage remaining being calculated from the percentage of dna in the tail . wild type seedlings displayed very rapid repair of dsbs. the repair was biphasic, with a very rapid initial phase followed by a slower phase in which the small remainder of dna damage was repaired. the initial rapid removal of the majority of dsbs from genomic dna followed first order kinetics. analysis of the first ten minutes following bleomycin treatment found significantly slower dsb repair in the rnai lines compared to wild type plants with a t 1/ <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig>  min for two independent rnai lines compared to  <dig>  min for wild type plants . these differences led to the presence of a residual 10–20% of dsbs remaining in the rnai lines at  <dig> min as compared to hardly detectable levels in wild type plants, equating to the level of dsbs seen in wild type lines at  <dig> min. this contrasts with the repair kinetics of atlig <dig> mutant plants, which do not display a reduction in the initial rapid repair observed in the atlig1-rnai lines  <cit> . these results were consistent with a role for atlig <dig> in a novel pathway for the rapid repair of dsbs in plants, although the essential roles of this ligase in plant cells makes it difficult to determine the full extent of the role of atlig <dig> in this pathway.

discussion
dna ligases play essential cellular roles in sealing the phosphodiester backbone during dna repair and replication. although a role for arabidopsis lig <dig> in nhej is well established, the role of the other ligases in arabidopsis dna repair processes remains unclear. in the present study, the effects of reduced atlig <dig> levels on plant growth and dna repair kinetics were investigated by analysis of rnai silenced plant lines.

atlig <dig> silenced lines displayed a number of growth defects associated with reduced organ size and activation of stress responses. the slowed leaf growth of atlig <dig> deficient lines as compared to wild-type became increasingly evident with age. this is consistent with a gradual increased accumulation of dna damage products with leaf age due to reduced levels of atlig <dig> resulting in compromised repair capacity. atlig <dig> silenced lines displayed a number of growth defects including reduced organ size and activation of stress responses. the lack of normal atlig <dig> levels resulted in reduced cell size and an increase in cells in s-phase, which over the plant's life span was manifested phenotypically as retarded leaf growth. this becomes increasingly evident with plant age and is consistent with a requirement for atlig <dig> for normal growth and development. the oldest leaves of atlig <dig> deficient plants began to develop a dark green and eventually purple colouration, especially marked on the abaxial leaf surface . the development of this stressed phenotype is similar to previous accounts of the arabidopsis stress response, where the changes in colouration were due to elevated levels of anthocyanin production  <cit> . the oldest leaves eventually bleached, similar to plants exposed to a wide range of treatments including high uvc irradiation  <cit> . this finding demonstrates that reduction in normal atlig <dig> levels produces phenotypic changes associated with environmental stresses, consistent with the accumulation of dna damage in the rnai lines with age. environmental stresses often induce reactive oxygen species resulting in forms of dna damage are predominantly repaired via base and nucleotide excision repair pathways. chronic exposure to these stresses may also result in accumulation of dsbs in the plant genome with time as a consequence of unrepaired single strand breaks being converted into more cytotoxic dsbs  <cit> . the stress response exhibited by the atlig1-rnai lines may be activated by the presence of dna strand breaks usually associated with oxidative dna damage. the atlig <dig> deficient plants displayed reduced growth but interestingly the rnai lines bolted and flowered significantly earlier than wild-type lines  in common with previous studies that reported precocious flowering in plants stressed by exposure to low levels of gamma-radiation  <cit>  or uvc  <cit> .

further analysis investigated the repair kinetics of single and double strand dna breaks induced in wild type and silenced lines. of the different forms of dna damage, dsbs are one of the most cytotoxic and, if left unrepaired, can result in chromosome fragmentation and loss of genetic information. in eukaryotes, dsbs are repaired by homologous recombination or nhej pathways. in arabidopsis the nhej pathway components ku <dig>  ku <dig> and lig <dig> are all required for survival of gamma irradiated plants  <cit> . however, several lines of evidence strongly support the existence of end joining pathways which are independent of ku and lig <dig> in higher plants. knockout mutants of classical nhej  pathway components in higher plants such as atku <dig> and atlig <dig> are able to integrate t-dna at random sites in the genome with frequencies of between 10–100% of that found in wild type plants  <cit> . consistent with these observations, illegitimate end-joining is still active in non-homologous end joining mutants, observed by chromosomal fusions and plasmid re-joining assays in planta  <cit> . recent studies revealed that atlig <dig> mutants display rapid rates of dsb repair, similar to those of wild type plants, indicating either that a second ligase activity or an independent pathway can effectively substitute for loss of lig <dig>  <cit> . analysis of the rnai lines indicated that atlig <dig> was required for the initial rapid phase of repair, with reduced atlig <dig> levels resulting in an increase in the half life of a dsb. this was not attributable to increased background levels of dsbs in the untreated atlig1-rnai lines, as these basal levels of genome fragmentation were similar to wild type lines. the decreased rates of dsb repair in the silenced plants suggests that atlig <dig> does not simply substitute for atlig <dig> in c-nhej, as atlig <dig> mutants do not display a reduction in this initial rapid phase of dsb repair. rather, these results indicate that atlig <dig> is required for the fast rejoining of the majority of dsbs within  <dig> min after the removal of bleomycin. while atlig <dig> is not required for the rapid initial phase of dsb repair, atlig <dig> mutants are hypersensitive to genotoxic agents. this suggests that a subset of dsbs may persist in atlig <dig> mutants that cannot be repaired by the rapid, atlig <dig> dependent mechanism. the repair of these dsbs requires the ku and lig <dig> mediated slower repair pathway, and failure to eliminate these lesions from the genome results in the ir hypersensitivity of nhej mutants. parallel pathways for end joining have also been identified in mammals, where a lig <dig> and ku independent pathway has been characterised  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms of these pathways are beginning to be determined, with one pathway mediated by parp <dig> and lig <dig> displaying greatest activity in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . in vitro studies using human cell extracts showed that both lig <dig> and lig <dig> can function in microhomology mediated end joining, whereas lig <dig> was not required  <cit> . a significant difference between dsb repair in plants and mammals is the requirement for lig <dig> for the rapid repair of dsbs  <cit>  in contrast to the rapid dsb repair observed in arabidopsis lig <dig> mutant lines  <cit> . this rapid repair pathway is dependent on the structural maintenance of chromosome -like proteins mim and rad <dig>  and analysis of the rnai lines suggest a role for lig <dig> in this dna repair pathway. future studies will further delineate the molecular mechanism of this repair pathway in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
while atlig <dig> null mutants are non-viable, plants with reduced atlig <dig> levels display growth defects, reduced cell size and a greater proportion of cells in s-phase, consistent with roles for arabidopsis dna ligase  <dig> in both dna repair and dna replication pathways. additionally atlig1-rnai plants show reduced rates of dna repair, including a significant delay in the initial rapid phase of dsb repair. these results indicate that atlig <dig> is required for the rapid ku/lig <dig> independent repair of dsbs in plants.
