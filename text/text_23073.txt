BACKGROUND
boron , an essential micronutrient for normal growth and development of plants, is involved in a series of important physiological functions, including the structure of cell walls, membrane integrity, cell division, phenol metabolism, protein metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism during growth and development of higher plants . b-deficiency widespreadly exists in many agricultural crops, including citrus. in china, b-deficiency is frequently observed in citrus orchards, and often contributes to the loss of productivity and poor fruit quality  <cit> . li et al. reported that up to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of ‘guanximiyou’ pummelo  orchards in pinghe, zhangzhou, china were deficient in leaf b and soil water-soluble b, respectively  <cit> .

in plants, approx. 21-nucleotide-long micrornas , one of the most abundant classes of non-coding small rnas , are crucial post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression by repressing translation or directly degrading mrnas in plants  <cit> . evidence shows that mirnas play key roles in plant response to nutrient deficiencies . identification of nutrient-deficiency-responsive-mirnas and their target genes has become one of the hottest topics in plant nutrition.

plants have developed diverse strategies to maintain phosphorus  homeostasis, including mirna regulations  <cit> . mir <dig>  which is specifically induced by p-deficiency in arabidopsis and rice, can regulate p homeostasis by negatively regulating its target gene ubc <dig>  <cit> . like mir <dig>  mir <dig> is also highly and specifically induced by p-deficiency and is involved in the regulation of plant p homeostasis by down-regulating its target gene nitrogen limitation adaptation  in arabidopsis  <cit> . in addition, many other p-deficiency-responsive mirnas  have been isolated from various plant species .

mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  which are induced by copper -deficiency, have been shown to play a role in the regulation of cu homeostasis by down-regulating genes encoding nonessential cu proteins such as cu/zn superoxide dismutase , laccases and plantacyanin, hence saving cu for other essential cu proteins such as plastocyanin, which is essential for photosynthesis  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, leaf mir <dig> was induced by sulfur -deficiency. mir <dig> targets atp sulfurylases  and sulfate transporter 2; <dig> , both of which are involved in the s metabolism. their transcripts are greatly down-regulated in mir395-over-expressing transgenic arabidopsis accompanied by increased accumulation of s in the shoot but not in the root. they concluded that mir <dig> play a role in the regulation of plant s accumulation and allocation by targeting aps and sultr2; <dig>  <cit> .

mirnas have been shown to play a role in the adaptation of plants to fe-deficiency. eight fe-deficiency-responsive conserved mirnas from five families had been identified in arabidopsis roots and shoots and their expression profiles differed between the two organs  <cit> . valdés-lópez et al. isolated ten up- and four down-regulated mirnas, five up- and six down-regulated mirnas, and seven up- and four down-regulated mirnas from the leaves, roots and nodules of fe-deficient common bean  <cit> . waters et al. obtained eight differentially expressed mirnas from seven conserved families in the rosettes of fe-deficient arabidopsis. interestingly, fe-deficiency led to increased accumulation of cu in rosettes and decreased expression levels of mir397a, mir398a and mir398b/c, which regulate the mrna levels of genes encoding cu-containing proteins, implying a links between fe-deficiency with cu homeostasis  <cit> .

many n-deficiency-responsive mirnas have been identified from arabidopsis, soybean, maize and common bean. these mirnas belong to at least  <dig> conserved families  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the expression of mir <dig> was inhibited by n-deficiency, while the expression levels of its target genes  were increased  <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing mir169a had less accumulation of n and nfya family members, and were more sensitive to n stress than the wild type, demonstrating a role for mir <dig> in the adaptation of plants to n-deficiency  <cit> . it is worth noting that some n-deficiency-responsive mirnas  are also responsive to other nutrient stresses  in plants  <cit> , indicating the involvement of mirna-mediated crosstalk among n, b, p, fe, s and cu under n-deficiency.

an increasing number of nutrient-deficiency-responsive mirnas have been identified with different techniques . most research, however, has focused on n, p, s, cu and fe deficiencies, limited data are available on the differential expression of mirnas and their target genes in response to deficiencies of other nutrient elements. recently, we investigated mirna expression profiles in response to b-deficiency in citrus sinensis roots by illumina sequencing and identified  <dig>  b-deficiency-responsive mirnas, suggesting the possible roles of mirnas in the tolerance of citrus plants to b-deficiency  <cit> . previous studies showed that the responses of mirnas to nutrient deficiencies differed between plant roots and shoots   <cit> . in addition, there were great differences in b-deficiency-induced changes in major metabolites, activities of key enzymes involved in organic acid and amino acid metabolism, gas exchange and gene expression profiles between roots and leaves of c. sinensis  <cit> . therefore, b-deficiency-induced changes in mirna expression profiles should be different between citrus roots and leaves.

in this study, we sequenced two small rna libraries from b-deficient and -sufficient  citrus leaves, respectively, using illumina sequencing, then identified the known and novel mirnas as well as the b-deficiency-responsive mirnas. also, we predicted the target genes of these known and novel b-deficiency-responsive mirnas and discussed their possible roles in the response to b-deficiency in citrus. the objective of this study is to identify the potential mirnas related to the tolerance of citrus to b-deficiency.

RESULTS
b and cu concentrations in leaves
b concentration in 10 μm b-treated leaves was in the sufficient range of  <dig> to 100 μg g− <dig> dw, while the value in 0 μm b-treated leaves was much less than 30 μg g− <dig> dw   <cit> . visible b-deficient symptoms were observed only in 0 μm b-treated leaves . therefore, seedlings treated with 0 μm b are considered as b-deficient, and those treated with 10 μm b are considered as b-sufficient. b-deficiency decreased leaf concentration of cu .fig.  <dig> effects of b-deficiency on b and cu concentration in leaves. bars represent mean ± se . different letters above the bars indicate a significant difference at p <  <dig> 



sequencing and analysis of two small rna libraries from b-sufficient and -deficient citrus leaves
as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were generated from the libraries of b-sufficient and -deficient leaves, respectively. after removal of the contaminant reads like adaptors and low quality tags,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clear reads were obtained from the libraries of b-sufficient and -deficient leaves, comprising  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unique clear reads, respectively. among these reads,  <dig> , <dig> clean reads  from b-sufficient leaves and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads  from b-deficient leaves were mapped to c. sinensis genome  using soap  <cit> . exon, intron, mirna, rrna, repeat regions, snrna, snorna and trna reads were annotated, respectively. after removal of these annotated reads, the remained unique reads that were used to predict novel mirnas for b-sufficient and -deficient leaves were  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads, respectively.table  <dig> statistical analysis of srna sequencing data from b-sufficient and -deficient leaves of citrus sinensis




most of the clear sequences were within the range of 19–26 nt, which accounted for 89 % of the total clear reads. reads with the length of 24 nt were at the most abundant, followed by the reads with the length of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 20 nt . overall, the size distribution of srnas agrees with the results obtained on roots of citrus sinensis  <cit> , fruits of c. sinensis  <cit>  and citrus trifoliata, and flowers of c. trifoliate  <cit> . this indicates that the data of srna libraries obtained by the illumina sequencing are reliable.

identification of known and novel mirnas in citrus leaves
here, a total of  <dig> known mirnas were isolated from the two libraries . the count of reads was normalized to transcript per million  in order to compare the abundance of mirnas in the two libraries. the most abundant mirna isolated from b-sufficient and -deficient libraries was mir <dig> , followed by mir <dig>  and mir <dig> . in this study, only these known mirnas with normalized read-count more than ten tpm in b-sufficient and/or -deficient leaf libraries were used for further analysis in order to avoid false results caused by the use of low expressed mirnas  <cit> . after removal of these low expressed mirnas, the remained  <dig> known mirnas were used for further analysis .

after removal of these annotated reads , the remained  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads from b-sufficient and -deficient libraries, respectively were used to predict novel mirnas using the mireap . based on the criteria for annotation of plant mirnas  <cit> , a total of  <dig> novel mirnas were isolated from the two libraries . like the known mirnas, novel mirnas with normalized read-count less than ten tpm were not included in the expression analysis  <cit> . after excluding these low expressed novel mirnas, the remained  <dig> mirnas were used for further analysis .

identification of b-deficiency-responsive mirnas in citrus leaves
we identified  <dig>  up- and  <dig>  down-regulated mirnas from b-deficient leaves. the most pronounced up- and down-regulated known  mirnas were mir <dig> with a fold-change of  <dig>   and mir <dig> with a fold-change of − <dig>  , respectively .

validation of high-throughput sequencing results by qrt-pcr
we analyzed the expression of  <dig> known mirnas using stem-loop qrt-pcr in order to validate the mirna expression patterns revealed by illumina sequencing. the expression levels of all these mirnas except for mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were comparable in magnitude to the expression patterns obtained by illumiona sequencing . obviously, the high-throughput sequencing allowed us to identify the differentially expressed mirnas under b-deficiency.fig.  <dig> relative abundances of selected known mirnas in b-deficient and control leaves revealed by qrt-pcr. bars represent mean ± sd . significant differences were tested between control and b-deficient leaves for the same mirna. different letters above the bars indicate a significant difference at p <  <dig> . all the values were expressed relative to the control leaves



identification of targets for differentially expressed mirnas and go analysis
in this study, we predicted  <dig> and  <dig> target genes from the  <dig> known and  <dig> novel differentially expressed mirnas, respectively . go categories were assigned to all these target genes based on the cellular component, molecular function and biological process. these target genes for the known and novel mirnas were related to  <dig> and  <dig> components, respectively based on the cellular component. the most three go terms for known mirnas were membrane, chloroplast and plastid, while more than 42 % of the target genes for novel mirnas belonged to membrane . based on the molecular function, the target genes for the known and novel mirnas genes were grouped into  <dig> and  <dig> categories, respectively, the highest percentage of three categories were nucleic acid binding, metal ion binding and transcription factor activity . in the biological process, the target genes were mainly focused on response to stress and developmental process for known mirnas, and nucleic acid metabolic process, developmental process, response to stress and regulation of transcription for novel mirnas, respectively .fig.  <dig> go of the predicted target genes for  <dig>  differentially expressed known  mirnas. categorization of mirnas target genes was performed according to cellular component , molecular function  and biological process 



qrt-pcr validation of target genes
to verify the expression of the target genes and how the mirnas regulate their target genes,  <dig> genes targeted by  <dig> down- and  <dig> up-regulated mirnas were assayed by qrt-pcr . among the  <dig> genes, the expression changes of  <dig> target genes showed a negative correlation with their corresponding mirnas, implying that mirnas might play a role in regulating gene expression under b-deficiency by cleaving mrnas. however, the expression changes of the remained  <dig> target genes had a positive correlation with their corresponding mirnas, which might be the results of the interaction of different target genes.table  <dig> qrt-pcr relative expression of experimentally determined or predicted target genes of selected mirnas

both fold change of mirnas and relative change of target genes are the ratio of b-deficient to –sufficient leaves. the value is an average of at least three biological replicates with three technical replicates; target genes that had the expected changes in mrna levels were marked in bold. * and ** indicate a significant difference at p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig> , respectively



discussion
evidence shows that mirnas are involved in the adaptive regulation of higher plants to nutrient deficiencies  <cit> . here, we isolated  <dig>  up- and  <dig>  down-regulated mirnas from b-deficient leaves , indicating that b-deficiency greatly affected the expression profiles of mirnas in leaves. the differentially expressed mirnas isolated from leaves were more than from roots   <cit> . the majority of the differentially expressed mirnas were isolated only from b-deficient roots or leaves, only  <dig> mirnas were isolated from the both. moreover, among the  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> mirnas in roots and leaves displayed different responses to b-deficiency . in conclusion, many differences existed in b-deficiency-induced changes in mirna expression profiles between roots and leaves.table  <dig> list of differentially expressed mirnas present in both roots and leaves

data from additional file  <dig> and lu et al.  <cit> ; ** indicates a significant difference at p <  <dig> 



we found that mir <dig> was down-regulated in b-deficient leaves , as previously obtained on salt stressed sugarcane leaves  <cit> . patade and suprasanna showed that the up-regulation of myb at 1 h of salt-stressed sugarcane leaves was accompanied by the down-regulation of mir <dig>  <cit> . however, the expression of mir <dig> was up-regulated in p-deficient soybean  roots and leaves  <cit> . mir <dig> plays important roles in maintaining leaf phenotype by negatively regulating myb transcription factors  <cit> . dai et al. reported that the expression of osmyb3r- <dig> was induced by various abiotic stresses, and that over-expression of osmyb3r- <dig> enhanced tolerance to freezing, drought, and salt stress in transgenic arabidopsis  <cit> . b-1deficiency affects water uptake into the root, transport through the shoot, and loss of water from the leaves  <cit> . thus, b-deficiency-induced down-regulation of mir <dig> might increase the expression of mybs , thus improving the tolerance of plants to b-deficiency. qrt-pcr showed that all the four mybs target genes  were induced by b-deficiency except for the last one. similarly, the expression levels of myb transcription factor  targeted by mir <dig>  myb-like hth transcriptional regulator family protein and myb domain protein  <dig> targeted by mir <dig>  and myb-like hth transcriptional regulator family protein and myb transcription factor  targeted by mir <dig> increased in response to b-deficiency except for myb domain protein  <dig> . b-deficiency-induced up-regulation of mybs in citrus leaves agrees with the previous report that the expression of myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> were up-regulated at the slight corking veins and the seriously corky split veins caused by b-deficiency in ‘newhall’ navel orange  leaves  <cit> .

tir1/afb <dig>  auxin receptor  family f-box proteins are involved in auxin perception and signaling. the expression of taar is regulated by mir <dig>  <cit> . mir <dig> plays a key role in maintaining proper homeostasis of auxin signaling  <cit> . si-ammour et al. showed that mir <dig> down-regulated all four taar genes by guiding the cleavage of their mrnas, leading to the changes in auxin perception and some auxin-related leaf development  <cit> . stress-induced increase in mir <dig> level may decrease the level of tir <dig>  a positive regulator of growth and development, thereby resulting in attenuation in growth and development during stress conditions  <cit> . auxin response factors  play a role in relaying auxin signaling at the transcriptional level by inducing mainly three groups of genes   <cit> . mir <dig> is predicted to target arf <dig>  arf <dig> and arf <dig>  mir160-directed regulation of arabidopsis arf <dig> is necessary for the normal growth and development of many organs, proper gh3-like gene expression and perhaps auxin distribution, while the arf <dig> and arf <dig> knockout mutants do not display obvious developmental anomalies  <cit> . weakened plant growth and reduced metabolic rate are common survival strategies employed to divert energy and other resources to deal with stress conditions. it has been suggested that the stress-induced up-regulation of mir <dig> and mir <dig> might lead to the attenuation of plant growth and development under stress by repressing auxin signaling due to decreased tir <dig> level and by suppressing the arf-mediated gene expression, respectively, thus promoting plant stress tolerance  <cit> . therefore, b-deficiency-induced up-regulation of leaf mir <dig> and mir <dig> might be an adaptive response of plants to b-deficiency, because the expression of the three genes targeted by mir <dig> and tir <dig>  afb <dig>  afb <dig> and afb <dig> targeted by mir <dig> was down-regulated by b-deficiency except for afb <dig> . similarly, the expression of saur-like auxin-responsive protein family targeted by mir <dig> was down-regulated in b-deficient leaves despite decreased expression of mir <dig> . by contrast, root mir <dig> was up-regulated by b-deficiency  <cit> .

leaf mir <dig> was down-regulated by b-deficiency , as previously observed on transient low nitrate-stressed maize leaves  <cit> . water stress led to decreased expression of mir <dig> in cassava  leaves, while its target gene mesnac  was strongly induced  <cit> . as expected, the expression of nac domain transcriptional regulator superfamily protein and nac domain containing protein  <dig> was induced in b-deficient leaves, while the expression of nac domain containing protein  <dig> was depressed . over-expression of snac <dig> and osnac <dig> conferred drought and salt tolerance in rice  <cit> . sinac4-rnai tomato plants became less tolerant to salt and drought stress  <cit> . therefore, the down-regulation of mir <dig> in b-deficient leaves might be involved in the b-deficiency tolerance of plants by improving the expression of nac. however, xu et al. found that mir <dig> was up-regulated in maize leaves under chronic n limitation, and suggested that mir <dig> might function in remobilizing the n from old to new leaves to cope with the n-limiting condition via accelerating senescence due to decreased expression of nac  <cit> .

leaf mir <dig> was down-regulated by b-deficiency , as previously reported on n-deficient seedlings of arabidopsis  <cit> . mir <dig> targets genes encoding cu containing proteins such as cu/zn sods , plantacyanin and several laccases  <cit> . abdel-ghany and pilon observed that mir <dig> was induced under cu starvation to down-regulate target gene expression and to save cu for the most essential functional protein, concluding that might play a role in the regulation of cu homeostasis  <cit> . although b-deficiency decreased leaf concentration of cu, its level was not lower than the sufficiency range of cu in citrus leaves  <cit> . thus, b-deficiency-induced decrease in mir <dig> might be advantageous to plant survival under b-deficiency by regulating cu homeostasis and improving antioxidant  activity, because the expression of its four target genes was induced by b-deficiency except for laccase  <dig> . indeed, sod activity was higher in b-deficient c. sinensis leaves than in b-sufficient ones  <cit> . also, sod expression was up-regulated in b-deficient medicago truncatula root nodules  <cit> .

leaf mir <dig> was up-regulated by b-deficiency , as previously reported on salt-stressed populus cathayana plantlets  <cit> . nac and gras transcription factors are target genes of mir <dig>  nac is involved in developmental process and stress responses  <cit> , while gras proteins play a role in signal transduction and the maintenance and development of meristems  <cit> . also, gras is the target gene of mir <dig> , mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit> , and nac is the target gene of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> . this indicates the complex regulation in plant development and stress response.

wrky proteins play important roles in plant responses to biotic stresses, allowing plants to adapt to unfavorable environmental conditions including b-deficiency  <cit> . our results showed that leaf transcript of mir <dig> decreased in response to b-deficiency accompanied by increased expression of its target gene: wrky dna-binding protein  <dig> , which agrees with the previous reports that wrky <dig> dna binding protein expression was induced in b-deficient m. truncatula root nodules  <cit>  and that wrky <dig> was up-regulated in b-deficient arabidopsis roots  <cit> . over-expression of various wrky conferred tolerance to different abiotic stresses in different plant species, possible through the regulation of the reactive oxygen species system  <cit> . transgenic nicotiana benthamiana plants over-expressing ghwrky <dig> had enhanced tolerance to salt and oxidative stress and increased expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes such as sod, ascorbate peroxidase , catalase  and glutathione-s-transferase   <cit> . thus, leaf expression levels of antioxidant enzyme genes might be increased in response to b-deficiency. this agrees with our report that b-deficient citrus leaves had higher activities of sod, apx, mdar and gr  <cit> . heat shock proteins /chaperones function in protecting plants against various stresses. as expected, the expression of mir <dig> was down-regulated in b-deficient leaves accompanied by increased expression of its one target gene: chaperone dnaj-domain superfamily protein . similarly, leaf expression levels of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were decreased by b-deficiency accompanied by increased expression levels of their corresponding target genes: dnaj-domain superfamily protein . however, the expression of heat shock transcription factor a6b targeted by mir <dig> were inhibited in b-deficient leaves despite down-regulated expression of mir <dig> . hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins  are the most abundant cell wall structural proteins in dicotyledonous plants  <cit> . hall and cannon demonstrated that the cell wall hrgp rsh was required for normal embryo development in arabidopsis  <cit> . bonilla et al. observed that b-deficiency-induced aberrant cell walls of bean root nodules lacked covalently bound hrgps  <cit> . here, the expression of hrgp family protein , a target gene of mir <dig>  was up-regulated in b-deficient leaves , thus enhancing plant tolerance to b-deficiency. however, mir <dig> was down-regulated in b-deficient leaves, but its target gene  was also depressed .

b-deficiency lowered leaf expression level of mir <dig> , as previously obtained on n-deficient arabidopsis seedlings  <cit>  and b-deficient citrus roots  <cit> . the down-regulation of mir <dig> means that its target genes: spfh/band 7/phb domain-containing membrane-associated protein family, fucosyltransferase  <dig> and lipase class  <dig> family protein might be up-regulated in b-deficient leaves. however, qrt-pcr showed that the expression of the former two target genes was induced by b-deficiency, while the last one was down-regulated . lu et al. reported that fucosyltransferase  <dig> and lipase class  <dig> family protein were down-regulated in b-deficient citrus roots accompanied by decreased expression of mir <dig>  <cit> .

the major facilitator superfamily  is the largest group of transport carriers, which are often coupled to the movement of another ion  <cit> . kaya et al. reported that atr <dig>  which encodes a multidrug resistance transport protein of the mfs, was responsible for most of the tolerance of high b in saccharomyces cerevisiae, concluding that atr <dig> was a b exporter  <cit> . in this study, leaf mir <dig> was induced by b-deficiency accompanied by decreased expression of its target gene: mfs protein , thus decreasing b export from plants and improving plant tolerance to b-deficiency.

we found that leaf mir <dig> was induced by b-deficiency accompanied by increased expression of its target gene: ammonium transporter 1; <dig> , which disagrees with our report that the abundance of mir <dig> was lower in b-deficient citrus roots than in controls, while the expression level of ammonium transporter 1; <dig> was higher in the former  <cit> .

we observed that mir <dig> was inhibited in b-deficient leaves , which disagrees with the previous report that mir <dig> was induced in b-deficient c. sinensis roots  <cit> . all the  <dig> target genes targeted by mir <dig> were induced by b-deficiency except for homeobox-leucine zipper protein  <dig> /hd-zip protein, endosomal targeting bro1-like domain-containing protein , myb domain protein  <dig> and saur-like auxin-responsive protein family . previous studies showed that b-deficiency increased the expression levels of some transport-related genes and the abundances of some transport-related proteins in citrus roots  <cit> , thus improving the tolerance of plants to b-deficiency. bor <dig>  an efflux-type b transporter for xylem loading, play a key role in the tolerance of plants to low b. arabidopsis bor1- <dig> mutant was more sensitive to b-deficiency than the wild type  <cit> . oryza sativa bor <dig> has been demonstrated to be required for b acquisition by roots and translocation of b into shoots  <cit> . thus, b-deficiency-induced up-regulation of leaf endosomal targeting bro1-like domain-containing protein , phosphate transporter 1; <dig>  mate efflux family protein, vesicle-associated membrane protein  <dig> , potassium transport 2/ <dig> , ammonium transporter 1; <dig> , zn transporter  <dig> precursor  and cation/h+exchanger  <dig>  involved in cell transport  might contribute to the tolerance of citrus to b-deficiency. hd-zip transcription factors are found only in plants. the expression of hahb- <dig>  a member of helianthus annuus  subfamily i, strongly increased in water-stressed sunflower  <cit> . subsequent study showed transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing hahb- <dig> were more tolerant to drought by delaying the onset of senescence  <cit> . huang et al. demonstrated that ptrbhlh, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor of poncirus trifoliata might play a crucial role in cold tolerance via positively regulating peroxidase -mediated ros scavenging  <cit> . transketolase is a key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway  in plant cells. our finding that transketolase was up-regulated in b-deficient leaves agrees with the report that transketolase activity in maize moderately increased in response to salt or oxidative stress  <cit> . in citrus, ppp has been suggested to play a role in the tolerance of plants to b-deficiency by providing reducing power  and enhancing the antioxidant capacity  <cit> . protein disulfide isomerases , which act as molecular chaperones, play a role in the formation of proper disulfide bonds during protein folding  <cit> . over-expression of a protein disulfide isomerase-like protein  gene conferred hg tolerance in transgenic plants, which had higher antioxidant capacity and lower levels of superoxide anion radicals, h2o <dig> and malondialdehyde   <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  the expression level of pdil5- <dig> targeted by mir <dig> was increased in b-deficient leaves. to conclude, down-regulation of mir <dig> in b-deficient leaves might be an adaptive response of plants to b-deficiency.

carotenoid  isomerase , which catalyzes the isomerization of poly-cis-carotenoids to all trans-carotenoids in higher plants, is a regulatory step for car biosynthesis. arabidopsis mutants of crtiso had increased accumulation of poly-cis-carotenoids and reduced lutein concentration  <cit> . here, the expression of mir <dig> was increased and its one target gene: crtiso was decreased in b-deficient leaves , thus impairing car biosynthesis. this agrees with our report that b-deficient citrus leaves had lower car concentration  <cit> . plant phenolic secondary metabolites and their precursors are synthesized via the pathway of shikimate biosynthesis  <cit> . shikimate kinase, a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of polyphenols, catalyzes the fifth reaction of the shikimate pathway. as shown in table  <dig>  the expression level of shikimate kinase  <dig> was down-regulated in b-deficient leaves and the expression of mir <dig>  which targets the gene, was up-regulated. this disagrees with our report that b-deficient citrus leaves displayed increased accumulation of phenolics  <cit> .

mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades play important roles in plant response to various stresses. each mapk cascade consists of mapks, mapk kinases , and mapkk kinases . in plants, mapkkks have been shown to be involved in various stresses. ning et al. showed that transgenic rice plants over-expressing dsm <dig>  displayed higher tolerance to dehydration at the seedling stage by regulating ros scavenging  <cit> . in this study, leaf transcript of mir <dig> was decreased by b-deficiency and its target gene  was up-regulated under b-deficiency. this agrees with the report that mapkkk genes were induced by drought, heat, salt, cold, iaa and jasmonic acid  in arabidopsis  <cit> .

our finding that leaf expression level of mir <dig> decreased in response to b-deficiency, and its target gene  was induced by b-deficiency . this agrees with our report that b-deficient citrus leaves had increased activity of pepc and dark respiration  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas from b-sufficient and -deficient citrus leaves using illumina sequencing, and obtained  <dig>  up- and  <dig>  down-regulated mirnas from b-deficient citrus leaves. obviously, the expression of mirnas was greatly altered in b-deficient leaves, which might play a role in the tolerance of plants to b-deficiency. in this study, we proposed a model for the responses of leaf mirnas to b-deficiency by integrating the present results with the data available in the previous literatures . the adaptive responses of leaf mirnas to b-deficiency might be associated with several aspects:  attenuation of plant growth and development by down-regulating tir <dig>  arf and afb due to up-regulated mir <dig> and mir <dig>  and by lowering the expression of saur-like auxin-responsive protein family targeted by mir <dig>  thus enhancing plant stress tolerance;  improving the expression of nacs due to decreased expression mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  hence maintaining leaf phenotype and enhancing the stress tolerance;  activation of the stress responses and antioxidant system due to decreased expression of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir3446;  decreased expression of mfs resulting from increased expression of mir <dig>  thus lowering b export from plants. in addition, b-deficiency-induced down-regulation of mir <dig> might be involved in the tolerance of plants to b-deficiency by regulating cu homeostasis and enhancing sod activity. in conclusion, our study reveals some adaptive mechanisms of citrus to b-deficiency.fig.  <dig> a potential model for the roles of mirnas in the tolerance of citrus plants to b-deficiency. vamp 726: vesicle-associated membrane protein 726; che: cation/h+ exchanger 25
