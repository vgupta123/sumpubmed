BACKGROUND
phylogenetic trees are used to represent evolutionary relationships between biological taxa, while taxonomical hierarchies such as the ncbi taxonomy are used to structure the wealth of molecular sequence data. the size of trees under consideration is growing larger and larger.

the tree of life project  <cit> , which aims at reconstructing the evolutionary relationship of all living species on earth, now considers more than  <dig>  species. the ribosomal database project ii provides a hierarchical browser for a collection of approximately  <dig>  ribosomal rna sequences. recent metagenomic analysis software  <cit>  makes use of the full ncbi taxonomy, which now contains more than  <dig>  taxa, to estimate the taxonomical content of a dataset.

most currently available tree viewers are designed to handle trees containing up to a few thousand nodes. a notable exception is treejuxtaposer  <cit> , which was explicitly designed to visualize large trees. while treejuxtaposer is the tool of choice for very large datasets , it has limited value as an all-round tree visualization tool, as it only implements one particular tree view , it lacks basic graphics export capabilities and it does not allow one to save and reopen a modified tree.

RESULTS
dendroscope is designed as an all-round tree visualization tool that can handle trees with hundred thousands of taxa . trees can be read and written in newick or nexus format  <cit> , as produced by standard tree reconstruction programs. additionally, dendroscope uses its own file format to save and reopen  trees that have been edited graphically using different colors, line widths and fonts.

a tree can be displayed in a number of views, namely as a circular, radial or rectangular phylogram, as  circular, rectangular or slanted cladogram, or as an unrooted diagram . the nodes, edges and labels of a tree can be interactively formatted and edited . trees can be rerooted and subtrees can be rotated, collapsed, extracted and removed. in the rectangular and slanted views, a horizontal magnifier band can be used to enlarge a part of the tree. in the circular and radial views, a circular magnifier is available, which can also be switched to "magnify all mode", if desired . a search tool can be used to find and locate taxa in the tree. all views are exportable as eps, svg, png, jpeg, gif and bmp graphic files. installers are available for linux/unix, macos x and windows xp.

comparison with other tree viewers
in a survery of existing tree vizualisation and manipulation programs we screened over  <dig> programs . in table  <dig>  we compare dendroscope to a selection of tree viewing programs which are either widely used or have exceptional features: atv  <cit> , hypertree  <cit> , mega  <cit> , phylip's  <cit>  drawtree/drawgram, splitstree <dig>  <cit> , treeview  <cit> , treejuxtaposer  <cit>  and treedyn  <cit> . of the existing programs, only treejuxtaposer and phylip's drawtree and drawgram can handle very large trees. phylip's drawtree and drawgram are non-interactive and so are of limited use. treejuxtaposer is currently the viewer of choice for large trees. splitstree <dig> and treejuxtaposer provide different mechanisms for comparing two or more trees. treedyn provides useful features such as scriptability, interoperability with tree databases and especially the possibility to display and manipulate many trees in parallel. its drawbacks are the limit to trees of only moderate size and the complex user interface.

the system requirements of existing viewers vary: some work only with particular versions of unix/linux or macos, or they need additional software to be installed. however, all viewers listed in table  <dig> run on linux/unix, macos and windows, except mega, which runs only on windows.

dendroscope at work
our objective was to build a tree viewer that is able to handle a tree as large as the current version of the ncbi taxonomy. on a standard laptop, dendroscope performs well on this tree in all rectangular and slanted views. circular and radial view are less suitable for very large data sets. figure  <dig> shows a screenshot of the ncbi taxonomic tree loaded in dendroscope showing homo sapiens and the hominidae. figure  <dig> demonstrates some of the views provided by the program.

CONCLUSIONS
with dendroscope, we have developed a new all-round tree viewer that combines all major features found in popular viewers into a single program that can handle large datasets.

availability and requirements
dendroscope is freely available and can be downloaded from . the software is written in java  <dig>  and installers are provided for linux/unix, macos x and windows.
