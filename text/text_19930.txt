BACKGROUND
the mammalian hair follicle  is a unique, highly regenerative neuroectodermal-mesodermal interaction system, containing a large number of stem cells  <cit> . the hf cycles throughout the entire life of mammals to produce new hair through stages of growth , regression  and quiescence   <cit> . the hf transition between different stages is driven by a strictly controlled interaction of numerous growth stimulatory and inhibitory factors, which originate from the skin epithelium and mesenchyme  <cit> . each stage is characterised by specific patterns of gene activation and silencing  <cit> . these conversions are controlled by the local signal environment, cytokines, hormones, neurotransmitters, as well as the transcription factors and enzymes that are recognised by key mediators in the hf cycle  <cit> .

micrornas  are a large family of endogenous, non-coding rnas, about 22-nucleotide  long, which regulate gene expression through sequence-specific base pairing with target mrnas  <cit> . approximately  <dig>  mirnas have been identified in  <dig> species of animals, plants and microorganisms. over the past decade, accumulating evidence has shown that mirnas play fundamental roles in the development, function, and maintenance of tissues and cells in various organisms  <cit> . mirnas are involved in the control of each stage of the hair cycle and regulate the transition between distinct hair-cycle stages by targeting different signalling pathways and transcription factors. mice carrying a keratinocyte-specific dicer deletion have severe alterations in hf morphogenesis, formation of large germ-like cysts, and hyperproliferation of the epidermis  <cit> . mir- <dig> regulates the epidermal keratinocyte differentiation and directed repression of p <dig> expression  <cit> . moreover, mir-200b and mir-196a have been implicated in the control of hf development as potential targets for the wnt signalling pathway  <cit> . the expression of mir- <dig> markedly increases during anagen and decreases during catagen and telogen. mir- <dig> is involved in the establishment of an optimal balance of gene expression in the hf, which is required for its proper growth and hair-fibre formation  <cit> .

cashmere goats have a double coat consisting of the over hair produced by primary hfs and the under hair , produced by secondary hfs  <cit> . the growth of secondary follicles consists of three stages annually: anagen , catagen  and telogen   <cit> .

the shanbei white cashmere goat , a chinese domestic goat breed, is farmed to provide cashmere, wool and meat. here, we present a genetic study of the mirnas in swcg hfs, and investigate the differential expression of mirnas in each distinct stage of swcg hf cycles by solexa sequencing. we further explore their functions in the regulation of the hair growth cycle.

RESULTS
solexa-sequencing of small rnas
in order to identify mirnas involved in the three phrases  of the hair cycle, three small rna  libraries representing the above three phrases were constructed from a mixed pool of ten adult cashmere goat skin samples. the srna libraries were subsequently sequenced by solexa sequencing. a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained. after discarding the sequences shorter than  <dig> nt, eliminating low-quality sequences and removing contaminants formed by adapter–adapter ligation, reads without 3′ ligation and insert tags were obtained. collectively,  <dig> , <dig> clean reads remained for further analysis .

we then analysed the length distribution based on the three libraries and distinct sequences to assess the sequencing quality . among these sequences, most were distributed in the 18– <dig> nt range. the highest percentages of these srnas were 22-nt long, which is consistent with the common size of mirnas.

subsequently, in order to analyse their expression and distribution in the goat genome, all of the clean solexa reads were aligned with the goat genome sequence using soap software . of  <dig> , <dig> reads screened in the anagen stage,  <dig> , <dig> reads and  <dig>  unique srnas, representing  <dig> % of total reads and  <dig> % of unique srnas, respectively, were matched by the goat genome sequence . to further assess the efficiency of solexa sequencing for mirna detection, all of the clean reads were annotated and classified using tag2annotation software ), aligned against the rfam <dig>  database and the mirbase <dig>  database. however, some srna reads may be mapped to more than one category. in order to better align every unique srna to one annotation, we conducted the following priority criteria: rrna etc.  > conserved mirna > repeat > exon > intron.

the total rrna proportion is a sign of the quality of the samples, for instance, the proportion of total rrna should be less than 60% in plant samples  <cit> , and 40% in animal samples . the total rrna proportion in the present study was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % in anagen, catagen and telogen, respectively, indicating that the skin samples used were of a high quality. all of the clean reads were divided into the following categories: exon_antisense, exon_sense, intron_antisense, intron_sense, mirna, rrna, repeat, scrna, snrna, snorna, srprna, trna, unan  . among them, the conserved mirnas have  <dig> , <dig> total reads and  <dig> unique reads, which represented  <dig> % of total reads and  <dig> % of unique clean reads. of the unique reads,  <dig> % were identified as potential novel mirnas, representing  <dig> % of clean reads.

expression analysis of conserved mirnas
since there are no goat mirnas available in the mirbase  <dig>  database, we compared the clean reads with the mirna precursor/mature mirnas with known cattle sequences. our results demonstrate that mirna expression is abundant in the skin of cashmere goats, as a total of  <dig> mirnas were found in the three stages of the hf cycle . among them,  <dig> mirnas were expressed in all three cycling stages, whereas  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were specifically expressed in anagen, catagen, and telogen, respectively .

we then analysed the differentially expressed mirnas between the samples from every two-hair-cycle stage . most of the expression levels were equivalent, but there were also some mirna expression differences between the two stages .  <dig> % of the mirna expression was not significant,  <dig> % of the mirnas were significantly different  and  <dig> % of the mirnas were significantly different  in the catagen and anagen stages .

mirnas with similar expression patterns in different sample pairs were clustered together. clustering analysis was based on the sample difference model by using cluster software, and the results were viewed with java treeview. all differentially expressed mirnas clustered together after five rounds of clustering .

quantitative rt-pcr validation
to verify the solexa sequencing data, we randomly selected five differentially expressed mirnas , and conducted quantitative rt-pcr. the relative expression levels of five selected mirnas were consistent with the solexa sequencing results since they had a similar trend of expression in all three periods .

identification of novel mirnas
the characteristic hairpin structure of mirna precursors can be used to predict novel mirnas. we predicted novel mirnas by exploring the secondary structure, the dicer cleavage site and the minimum free energy of the unannotated small rna reads, which could be mapped to goat genome sequences by using mireap software. in total,  <dig> , <dig> unannotated sequences were used to predict novel mirnas by using the mireap software. among  <dig> potential novel mirnas identified,  <dig> mirnas were expressed in all three cycling stages, whereas  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were specifically expressed in anagen, catagen, and telogen, respectively . in addition, the length of the novel mirna sequences ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, with a distribution peak at  <dig> nt and their 5' ends were comprised most frequently of uridine  .

target gene prediction for mirnas
mirnas negatively regulate gene expression by base pairing between the 5' end of the mirna  and the 3′ untranslated regions  of target mrnas  <cit> . mireap software was used to predict target genes of the mirna by searching the bovine reference gene database . in the anagen stage,  <dig>  target sites in  <dig>  target genes were predicted for  <dig> mirnas, whereas  <dig>  target sites in  <dig>  target genes were predicted for  <dig> mirnas in catagen, and  <dig>  target sites into  <dig>  target genes were predicted among  <dig> mirnas in telogen.

gene ontology  enrichment and kegg pathway analysis of target genes
go enrichment analysis is used for predicting candidate target genes of mirnas. go enrichment analysis for target genes based on the cellular component showed that  <dig>  genes were termed good or better than  <dig> using the component ontology with p-value analysis . more than  <dig> % of genes were clustered into the cell part, followed by the intracellular part accounting for  <dig> % of target genes. analysis of molecular function showed that  <dig>  genes were assigned different functions, specifically  <dig> % of genes were related to binding functions, and  <dig> genes were related to biological processes. most of the genes were involved in cellular or metabolic processes. for example,  <dig> % of the genes were involved in cellular processes, and  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genes were involved in metabolic processes and biological regulation, respectively.

kegg pathway annotation showed that  <dig>  target genes were annotated for  <dig> biological functions. most of these genes were involved in cellular metabolism, diseases and signal transduction . the most commonly indicated pathway was the metabolic pathways, with  <dig> genes representing  <dig> % of the total target genes, followed by the pathways in cancer , mapk signalling pathway , endocytosis , and focal adhesion .

discussion
the srna digitalisation analysis based on high-throughput sequencing uses the sequencing-by-synthesis  technology predicts novel mirnas and constructs the srna differential expression profile between samples from every two-hair-cycle stage, which could be used as a powerful tool for the functional studies of srna  <cit> .

in this study, objective preliminary analysis of three cdna libraries has shown that 22-nt srna is the major type of srna, which is consistent with the majority of srna-lengths in cattle  <cit> , fish  <cit> , goats  <cit> , swine  <cit>  and chickens  <cit> . mature mirnas, which are identical to the classical size of dicer cleavage products  <cit> , also have a similar trend. however, the major type of srna screened by solexa sequencing in wheat is 24-nt in length  <cit> , implying that there are length differences between mirnas from animal and plant species.

several hf mirnas have been shown to be involved in the regulation and forming of hair loss, hypertrichosis and skin diseases in mice and humans  <cit> , however, rarely have been performed in goats for fibre. of the nine mirnas were specifically expressed in cashmere goat dorsal skin  <cit> , only four of them were examined in the present study: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-455-3p and mir-92b. this discrepancy might be caused by inaccurate processing, base modification and sequencing/pcr errors, and analysis used inconsistencies of the database. moreover, different genome assembly  may lead to the identification of various mirnas, even in the same goat breed. for instance, compared with  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas identified in the present study, liu et al.  discovered  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas in another chinese cashmere goat breed  by deep sequencing skin tissues that represented the anagen stage  <cit> .

in the whole hair cycle, the abundance of expression of let-7a-5p, let-7f, let-7b, let-7c, let-7g, mir-199a-3p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-320a reached their highest levels in the present study . these mirnas are involved in cell differentiation  <cit> , and proliferation  <cit> , and the development of nerves  <cit> , heart  <cit> , lung  <cit>  and muscle  <cit> , suggesting that these mirnas may play major roles in the regulation of fundamental biological processes, as well as the development of skin and hf.

hfs undergo a process of cyclical regeneration: growth, regression and quiescence. the transition from one stage to another is regulated by abundant molecules. our results showed that the expression patterns of mir- <dig>  mir-133a, mir-133b, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were significantly different in the three stages , indicating that they may participate in the regulation of follicular transition.

 according to the results of our cluster analysis, the expression patterns of mirnas in cashmere goat skins could be divided into five types during hair cycling . one of the patterns is the mirna expression level increases at anagen and then decreases during catagen and telogen . in comparison with telogen and catagen, most of the mirnas demonstrated dramatic expression changes in the anagen stage of hfs and skin, implying that these mirnas probably participate in the formation of new hair shafts and activation of a large number of signalling pathways controlling the expression of genes encoding hair-specific molecules  <cit> .

the major pathways predicted in this study were also mentioned previously. the findings of hf signal pathways in humans and mice indicates that the wnt  <cit> , tgf-β  <cit> , mapk  <cit> , shh  <cit> , notch and jak-stat  <cit>  pathways widely participate in every part of the hf cycle, development, and morphogenesis, and greatly contribute to all kinds of hf. of the target genes identified, 3% were from the mapk pathway,  <dig> % from wnt,  <dig> % from tgf-β,  <dig> % from shh,  <dig> % from notch and  <dig> % from jak-stat. the mirnas that correspond to these target genes will be our main candidate mirnas for further studies on hair cycles.

CONCLUSIONS
during the anagen-catagen-telogen transformation of the hair cycle in cashmere goats,  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were found via a high-throughput sequencing approach. our findings enrich the caprine mirna databases and provide new insights into the mirna transcriptome in cashmere goat skin and the hf cycle.
