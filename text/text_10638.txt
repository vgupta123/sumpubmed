BACKGROUND
retinal neuronal damage and death are common to a variety of ophthalmological and neurological conditions, including retinal injury following acute high intraocular pressure , retinal pigment epithelium detachment, vascular and age-related neuronal degenerations  <cit> . necrosis can be found at the early stage of ahiop. necrosis has been considered an accidental and uncontrolled form of cell death for a long time. however, evidence also shows that necrotic cell death is sometimes controlled as caspase-dependent apoptosis, named it as necroptosis or programmed necrosis. by using the necrostain- <dig>  and propidium iodide -staining after retina ischemia, rosenbaum et al. have found that necroptosis is considered as an important mode of neuronal cell death during ahiop, and autophagy deficit may be involved in this process  <cit> .

study of cellular necroptosis mechanism has been linked to rip  family and its relative molecular pathways. the receptor-interacting protein  <dig>  is originally cloned from the human fetal brain and aortic endothelium and identified as a member of rip family  <cit> . subsequently, rip <dig> is characterized as a n-terminal serine/threonine kinase capable of perceiving variations in internal cellular environment and participating in cell survival or death signaling  <cit> . rip <dig> binds to and induces rip <dig> phosphorylation, and thus activates the nuclear factor-kappa b   <cit> . rip <dig> may play a key role in necroptosis by activating tumor necrosis factor α   <cit> . other data suggest that rip <dig> activation may perturb energy metabolism by up-regulating glycogen phosphorylase  and glutamate dehydrogenase, which in turn potentiates superfluous α-ketoglutarate production and glucose phosphorylation, and eventually accelerates the krebs cycle in mitochondria leading to excessive genesis of reactive oxygen species .

base on the unknown molecular mechanisms of retinal neuronal necroptosis at the early stage of ahiop, we wondered whether rip <dig> alteration may be involved in cell death at the early stage of ahiop. in the present study we first characterized the cellular localization of rip <dig> in adult rat retina, and then detected the changes of rip <dig> expression relative to cell death at early stage of ischemia following ahiop.

methods
animals
twenty-four adult sprague–dawley rats weighing 200– <dig> grams, available from the animal center of central south university, were used in the present study. rats were randomly divided into the control group  and experimental group  subjected to induction of acute high intraocular pressure . all animals were housed in acrylic box cages with free access to food and water. animals were maintained under conditions of constant temperature , humidity  and lighting cycle . all experimental procedures used in the present study were approved by ethics committee of xiangya school of medicine, in accordance with the nih guidelines for use and care of laboratory animals.

induction of acute high intraocular pressure  and propidium iodide treatment
the animal model was prepared following the procedure described by tong  <cit> . in brief, animals were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate . a drop of chloramphenicol was administered to the conjunctive sac. a 30-gauge needle connected to the instillation instrument filled with normal saline was inserted into the anterior chamber. the intraocular pressure  was elevated to  <dig> mmhg, maintained for  <dig> min, and then gradually lowered to normal. the rats were allowed to survive for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs before terminal use. thirty minutes prior to animal perfusion,  <dig> μl pi  was administered by intravitreal injection.

tissue preparation
for anatomical examination, animals were deeply anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate  in saline , followed by trans-cardiac perfusion with saline and then 4% paraformaldehyde in  <dig>  m phosphate buffer  at different survival time points. the eyeballs were enucleated, and the cornea, lens and vitreous body were removed. the remaining eye cups were postfixed in 4% pf overnight, and immersed in ascending sucrose solutions  in  <dig>  m pb at 4°c for cryoprotection. the eye cups were embedded in optimal-cutting-temperature  medium , prepared into  <dig> μm thick cross-sections in a shanton cryostat . sections were thaw-mounted on positively charged microslides , allowed to air-dry and then stored at −20°c before further histological processing. for western blot analysis, eyeballs were removed immediately from deeply anesthetized rats after a vascular rinse with cold saline, and the retinas were dissected out and snap-frozen on dry-ice and stored at −70°c until tissue homogenization.

immunohistochemistry
for immunolabeling with the avidin-biotin complex  method, sections were treated in  <dig> % h2o <dig> in  <dig> m phosphate buffered saline  for  <dig> minute to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. non-specific antibody binding was blocked by a pre-incubation of sections in 5% normal horse serum  in pbs containing  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  for  <dig> hour at room temperature. sections were then incubated with a rabbit anti-rip <dig> antibody at 4°c overnight , then reacted with biotinylated horse anti-rabbit igg  for  <dig> hours at room temperature. after  <dig> hour incubation with the avidin-biotin complex reagents , immunoreaction product was visualized in pbs containing  <dig> % dab  and  <dig> % h2o <dig>  finally, the sections were dehydrated, cleared and coverslippered. the specificity of the rip <dig> antibody was evaluated by pre-absorption and omission of the primary antibody in immunohistochemistry. western blot was also used to confirm the antibody binding product.


for double immunofluorescence of rip <dig> co-localization in normal retina, sections were pre-incubated for  <dig> minutes in 5% donkey serum  in pbs containing  <dig> % triton x- <dig> at room temperature. sections were incubated with the rabbit anti-rip <dig> antibody and one of the mouse antibodies to neuronal and glial markers overnight . after several times rinses with pbs, sections were reacted with cy <dig> and cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies at 1: <dig> . the sections were then briefly incubated in bisbenzimide  at 1: <dig> , washed in pbs and covered with an anti-fading mounting medium  before microscopic examination.

for immunofluorescence of rip <dig> and double labeling of rip <dig> with bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> following ahiop, sections were pre-incubated for  <dig> minutes in 5% donkey serum  in pbs containing  <dig> % triton x- <dig> at room temperature. sections were incubated with the rabbit anti-rip <dig> antibody  or goat anti-rip <dig> and bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> antibodies overnight. after several times rinses with pbs, sections were reacted with cy <dig> and cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit/donkey anti-goat/donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies at 1: <dig> . the sections were then briefly incubated in bisbenzimide, washed in pbs and covered with an anti-fading mounting medium  before microscopic examination.

for double labeling of pi-labeled cells and rip <dig> following ahiop.  <dig> hr of pi-pretreated retinal sections were selected to carry out rip <dig> immunofluorescence staining. the protocol of rip <dig> immunofluorescence staining have illustrated before. photograph were using a confocal microscope  fitted with excitation/emission filters 568/ <dig> for pi.

immunoblotting
retinas were homogenized by sonication on ice in a digestion buffer  containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors . homogenates were centrifuged at  <dig> ×g for  <dig> min at 4°c. the supernatants were collected, and protein concentration determined by bicinnchoninic acid  assay . a total of  <dig> μg of protein in  <dig>  mm tris loading buffer , was boiled for  <dig> min, and loaded in each lane of 4-20% linear gradient tris–hcl ready gel . the polypeptides were electrotransferred to trans-blot® pure nitrocellulose membrane . non-specific binding was blocked with pbs containing 5% nonfat milk  and 3% bovine serum albumin . membranes were incubated with rip <dig> or β-tubulin antibodies overnight, and then in hrp-conjugated secondary antibodies  for  <dig> hour. immunoblotting products were visualized with an ecl plus™ western blotting detection kit according to manufacturer’s instruction , and images captured in a molecular dynamics phosphor imager . for rip <dig> antibody specific test, nitrocellulose membranes were blotted for rip <dig> with the presence of the immunogenic peptide corresponding to amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of murine rip <dig> .

imaging and data analysis
sections were examined on an olympus  microscope equipped with a digital camera and imaging system  for single  immunolabeling and on a confocal microscope  for rip <dig> distribution double immunolabeling and rip <dig> immunofluorescence following ahiop. for double labeling of bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> with rip <dig>  the slices were examined with a confocal microscope . in the latter case, immunofluorescence was scanned from  <dig> μm depth of tissue  around the middle segment of retina between the optic nerve disk and periphery. semi-quantitative analyses were conducted using approximately  <dig> merged images  from  <dig> animals  to estimate the frequency of colocalization. figure panels were assembled using photoshop cs <dig> . image j  were used to analyze the optical density value of the rip <dig> bands by western blot. the average values of rip <dig> and β-tubulin were compared, the average relative value was obtained. one-way analysis of variance was performed to test differences between group averages. all results were presented as mean ± sd. a value of p< <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
overall laminar distribution of rip <dig> immunoreactivity in retina
the rip <dig> antibody detected a monoband migrated approximately at  <dig> kda, consistent with the previous reports regarding the molecular weight of the protein  <cit> . in the presence of the immunogenic peptide, this immunoblotting band was eliminated . similarly, rip <dig> immunoreactivity in retinal cross-section could be abolished by pre-absorption of the primary antibody with the neutralizing peptide , or omission of the primary or secondary antibody .


immunohistochemistry using the peroxidase-dab method visualized a fairly broad laminar distribution of rip <dig> ir in the retina. overall, a strong cellular labeling was notable in the ganglion cell layer , with some labeled somata also seen in the inner nuclear layer  . diffuse and moderately intense neuropil-like labeling was present in the inner plexiform layer . weak labeling was found over the outer plexiform layer  to photoreceptor layer . the pigment epithelium cells exhibited fairly strong labeling .

double labeling for rip <dig> and neuronal markers in retina
confocal double immunofluorescence was carried out to determine rip expression relative to markers of major neuron phenotypes in the retina. in the gcl , the cellular labeling of rip <dig> was found to be commonly co-localized with neun  <cit> . preliminary cell count using high magnification  images revealed that rip <dig> labeling was found in approximately 42% of neun positive perikarya in the gcl . in the inl, rip <dig> ir was found to coexist in amacrine-like or horizontal-like neurons that were immunoreactive either for parvalbumin   or calbindin   <cit> , counting for roughly 18%  and 41%  respectively. in contract, no co-localization of rip <dig> ir was detected in the inl among neurons expressing pkcα , a marker for bipolar cells  <cit> . further, no distinct co-localization was found between rip <dig> and rhodopsin in the photoreceptor cells  <cit>  or their terminals .


as seen with the peroxidise-dab preparations , weak rip <dig> ir appeared in the inner and outer plexiform layers of the retina in confocal light microscopy . in double immunofluorescence, this terminal-like rip <dig> labelling was weaker relative to synaptophysin immunoreactivity in the ipl and opl . close examination indicated that rip <dig> and synaptophysin immunoreactivities appeared to be not co-localized in these two plexiform layers .

double labeling for rip <dig> and glial markers in retina
in order to further determine whether rip <dig> expression occurred in glial cells in retina, double immunofluorescence was performed for rip <dig> with glutamine synthetase , gfap, cd11b, markers for müller cells, astrocytes and microglia, respectively. rip <dig> and gs immunolabeled elements apposed closely to each other in the gcl , representing an interposing arrangement of the ganglion cells and müller glia  <cit> . the might exist infrequent co-localization between the two markers . gfap immunoreactive astrocytes were distributed in nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer. no clear somata co-localization was detectable between rip <dig> and gfap labeling, although small process-like element appears to exhibit double labeling . cd11b immunoreactivities were also largely located to the inner retina. double labeling was detectable around the rip <dig> immunoreactive somata or at process-like elements in the gcl and nfl .


changes of rip <dig> expression following ahiop
the immunofluorescence staining result showed that rip <dig> was mainly present in ganglion cell layer , nerve fiber layer , inner plexiform layer  and inner nuclear layer, but weakly staining occurs in other layers in retina , meanwhile, no difference in distribution was detected. generally, in contrast with the normal controls, significantly more distinct and heavier rip <dig> immunoreactive showed in ahiop animal models, a strong cellular labeling of rip <dig> in  <dig> hour and  <dig> hour groups was found, but weakly found in  <dig> hour groups.


the western blot results showed that rip <dig> was mainly exhibited as a single  <dig> kda band in all groups . the bands in ahiop groups were apparently thicker and larger than those of normal control groups. the band in  <dig> hour groups was thinner and smaller than those in injury groups and tended to be normal. β-tubulin was mainly exhibited as a single  <dig> kda band respectively in all four groups.


the optical density measurement and statistical analysis indicated that ahiop up-regulated the expression of rip <dig> in the early stage . the values of the bands density showed as following: normal control ,  <dig> hr ,  <dig> hr  and  <dig> hr . it demonstrated that rip <dig> bands density were increased firstly and then decreased as time extend within 1day.

double labeling for rip <dig> and pi in retina following ahiop at  <dig> hr
pi-positive cells were largely detected in the ganglion cell layer  and inner nuclear layer  in  <dig> hr group . pi-stainings were localized in nuclei, as confirmed with bisbenzimide stain, suggestive of the presence of necrosis cells in gcl and inl after  <dig> hr post-ischemia. rip <dig> and pi co-localization was found in gcl, with some pi-positive cells exhibited very strong rip <dig> .


double labeling for rip <dig> and bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> in retina following ahiop at  <dig> hr
there was no distinct cellular staining of bax and cleaved caspase- <dig> in normal rat retina . bax and cleaved caspase- <dig> positive cells were detected in gcl in  <dig> hr group, both of them were localized to nuclei, as confirmed with bisbenzimide staining. rip <dig> labeling was found to colocalization with bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> in gcl. some bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> positive cells exhibited strong rip <dig> . however, some strongly labeled rip <dig> cells did not exhibit bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> reactivity .


discussions
the retina is a part of the central nerve system and contains many types of neurons and glia cells with their somata and processes arranged in a stratified manner  <cit> . the retina has been used as an in vivo model for studying neuron stress and/or death in the central nervous system  <cit> . also, retinal neuronal degeneration itself is characterized in many clinical conditions that can lead to blindness  <cit> . understanding the molecular mechanism underlying cell stress and death in the retina may help develop therapeutic intervention for visual impairment. neuronal death owing to necrosis and apoptosis may exist in the retina under pathological conditions  <cit> . for instance, high intraocular pressure may cause necrosis and delayed apoptosis in the retina, as characterized in experimental models  <cit> . more recently, it is suggested that programmed necrosis, also called necroptosis, may occur at the early stage of ahiop  <cit> . this lately-recognized type of cell death may play an important role in neuronal degeneration in the inner retinal layers, namely the ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers.

rip <dig> is mainly expressed in neurons in the inner layer of normal rat retina
this present study reveals that rip <dig> is constitutively expressed in the adult rodent retina. the rip <dig> ir is detected across most neuronal somata and terminal layers of the retina, with labeling presented largely in the neuronal components. there exists a differential rip <dig> among retina neurons in normal adult rat retina. thus, rip <dig> ir is fairly abundant in the nfl and gcl, wherein the labeling is found largely in the ganglion cells. some discretely labeled elements appear to be the glial cells in this inner retinal location, including müller cells, astrocytes and microglia, although it is not certain whether the “co-localized profiles” are due to an proximity of the neuron-glia spatial arrangement, e.g., the ganglion cells vs müller cells in the gcl. the double labeling data in the present study also suggests a residential expression of rip <dig> in subpopulations of neurons that contain parvalbumin or calbindin. on the contrary, bipolar cells generally do not appear to exhibit impressive rip <dig> labeling. moreover, photoreceptors appeared to express rip <dig> at minimal levels under normal condition. the weak rip <dig> reactivity in plexiform layers  might relate to a dendritic labeling because there is no apparent co-localization of rip <dig> and synaptophysin. overall, the laminar and cellular rip <dig> expression patterns appear to be compatible with a notion that the up-regulation of this molecule could occur largely in the inner retinal layers, and may mediate necroptosis there under certain conditions. it should be noted that rip <dig> expression in the photoreceptor cells is low under normal condition, although a strong rip <dig> expression exists in the retinal pigment epithelial cells. the relevance of this distribution pattern at the outer layer of retina to the reported up-regulation of rip <dig> following pigment epithelium detachment remains an interesting issue to investigate  <cit> . finally, we should mention that the distribution of rip <dig> in normal adult retina was conducted by immunohistochemistry, which has limitations. our future studies, such as in situ hybridization, are warranted to further understanding of rip <dig> expression in the retina.

rip <dig> expression is up-regulated in retina ganglion cells at early stage of ahiop
data are considerably limited to date with regard to the expression of rip <dig> in the brain under normal and pathological conditions  <cit> . nonetheless, recent evidence suggests that rip <dig> may serve an important cellular factor regulating cellular/neuronal stress and death, possible by mediating necroptosis. a recent study in the retina demonstrates an up-regulation of rip <dig>  up to  <dig> fold, in an experimental model of retinal detachment, suggestive of a potential implication for necroptosis  <cit> . interestingly, in a preliminary gene-chip analysis we noticed an early but marked increase in rip <dig> mrna expression following ahiop in rat retina . in the present study, rip <dig> protein levels begin to increase at  <dig> hr, and reached maximum at  <dig> hr , implicating an involvement of rip <dig> modulation at the early stage of ahiop. however, currently there is no suitable morphological marker for necroptosis in vivo <cit> . using pi staining that labels necrotic cells, the present study show that rip <dig> expressing cells may also pi-positive in gcl at  <dig> hr following ahiop. our double labeling results show there is small extent of co-localization of rip <dig> with bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> in gcl. however, some rip <dig> strong expression cells are not exhibit bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> reactivities. this finding suggests that rip <dig> regulation may be potentially involved in the process of neuronal injury or death. previous studies have reported that over-expression of rip <dig> may induce apoptosis  <cit> , our results are consistent with these finding. however, our results show that not all rip3-upregulated cells exhibit co-localization with apoptosis relative proteins , which indicated that some rip <dig> over-expression may not induce apoptosis. based on the evidence of co-localization between rip <dig> strong expression cells and pi-staining , we speculate that rip <dig> up-regulation may participate in rgcs necroptosis following ahiop. however, because there is no specific marker for necroptosis, future studies are required to determine the precise role of early rip3-upregulation in retinal injury and diseases  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this present study demonstrates that rip <dig> is expressed differentially in retinal neurons in adult rats, including subsets of ganglion cells, amacrine and horizontal cells. rip <dig> expression in rgcs is up-regulated following ahiop, suggesting an involvement of rip <dig> in neuronal responses to acute ischemic insults.
