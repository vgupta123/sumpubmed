BACKGROUND
e. sakazakii is considered to be an opportunistic pathogen, implicated in food borne diseases causing meningitis or enteritis especially in neonates and infants  <cit> . mortality rates of  <dig> – 50% are reported for patients who contract the disease  <cit> . the survivors often suffer from severe neurological disorders. a recent study on the occurrence of e. sakazakii in production environments from food  factories and households isolated the organism with varying frequency from nearly all environments examined, strongly indicating, that this is a widespread organism  <cit> . up to now, e. sakazakii has been isolated from a wide range of foods, including cheese, meat, vegetables, grains, herbs and spices and uht milk, but most of the literature concentrates on the presence the organism in dried infant formula milk  <cit> . in  <dig>  clark et al.  <cit>  were the first to prove a clear epidemiologic correlation between e. sakazakii isolated from patients and dried infant formula involved in  <dig> hospital outbreaks using a combination of typing methods. although the levels of contamination seemed low, the authors could show, that with an initial concentration of  <dig> cfu/ml, reconstituted formula stored at room temperature would take approx.  <dig> hrs to reach  <dig> cells per  <dig> ml and even sooner in formula held on  <dig> – 37°c. since then, many case reports have described this epidemiologic correlation  <cit> .

cultural standard identification procedures for e. sakazakii include the observation of yellow pigmentation of colonies and the testing for glucosidase activity. based on this latter biochemical activity commercially selective chromogen media have recently been developed such as the druggan-forsythe-iversen agar, dfi  and the enterobacter sakazakii isolation agar, esia .

besides, molecular assays have often proven to be useful as they offer a alternative means to rapidly and specifically identify organisms from a wide variety of sources. although pcr detection methods are now widely used in identification of microorganisms, only one pcr system, based on a single available full-length 16s rrna gene sequence of type strain atcc  <dig> , was published up to now for e. sakazakii  <cit> . however, in our hands a preliminary evaluation of this system on a number of target and non-target strains showed significant specificity problems inherent in this assay. therefore, the aim of this study was to provide more full-length 16s rrna sequence data from e. sakazakii strains of different origin. finally, based on this new sequence data a specific pcr system was developed for e. sakazakii detection.

RESULTS
as a starting point, the full-length 16s rrna sequences of thirteen e. sakazakii strains from various sources  and of e. sakazakii type strain atcc  <dig> were determined. this sequence data has been deposited in the genbank . thereafter, a sequence comparison was performed between the 16s rrna genes of the fourteen e. sakazakii strains and the e. sakazakii type strain atcc  <dig> by calculation of a distance matrix using the arb programme. thirteen e. sakazakii strains used in the study exhibited  <dig>  to 100% sequence similarity to the e. sakazakii type strain atcc  <dig> . meanwhile similarity between strain atcc  <dig> and the strain atcc  <dig> was significantly lower .

phylogenetic affiliation of the newly obtained sequences to tree_jul04_ <dig> comprising > <dig>  almost full-length  16s rrna gene sequences revealed the presence of two phylogenetically distinct lineages within the e. sakazakii species. in figure  <dig> a subtree based on the data mentioned above is shown. from this analyses it can be observed, that thirteen of the fourteen newly sequenced strains cluster together with the e. sakazakii type strain atcc  <dig>  whereas the e. sakazakii strain atcc  <dig> forms a second branch within this group. the subtree was calculated using the treepuzzle tool within the arb package exhibiting a "consensus tree" from different calculation methods. the value on each branch is the percent occurrence of the branching order in  <dig> bootstrapped trees. the 92% bootstrap value for the e. sakazakii atcc  <dig> branch strongly supports the theory about the second lineage.

further qualitative inspection of the sequences revealed that, besides of the presence of a number of single base substitutions, at least four "hot spots" of polymorphisms can be observed along the e. sakazakii 16s rrna gene . within these regions substitutions ranging from two to seven bases are present in all strains investigated and are most pronounced in e. sakazakkii strain atcc  <dig>  thus providing the bases for the formation of the second phylogenetic branch. in table  <dig>  the sequence polymorphisms in the above mentioned regions are shown for all e. sakazakii strains investigated in the study in relation to the e. sakazakii typestrain atcc  <dig>  e. cloacae typestrain atcc <dig> and e. coli type strain atcc  <dig>  recently, a number of e. sakazakii partial sequences were deposited into the public database  <cit> . addition of these partial sequences  to the phylogenetic tree further confirms the presence of the two lineages within the e. sakazakii species . however, for a reliable pylogenetic analyses determination of at least  <dig> nucleotides is recommended  <cit> . the impact of this second phylogenetic line within the e. sakazakii species in view of clinical and food safety aspects needs further evaluation.

in a second step, based on our new sequence information, we designed a specific primer pair for the amplification of the 16s rrna gene of strains within the two phylogenetic lineages of e. sakazakii. they were first evaluated using probe-match tool of the arb software. additionally, blast searches were performed against the non-redundant database  of embl/genbank. both primers seemed to be specific. amplification conditions in the assay were optimized by taking an annealing temperature of 60°c for  <dig> min.

we then sought to evaluate the utility of the pcr assay next. in particular the assay's ability to correctly identify different e. sakazakii strains as well as to differentiate e. sakazakii from other closely related enterobacteriacae was assessed. this was done by applying the assay to purified genomic dna template from isolates of  <dig> known e. sakazakii strains form different origin and  <dig> non e. sakazakii strains. a gel-based example of the screen is shown in figure  <dig>  where e. sakazakii isolates and non-target microorganisms were analyzed. the rest of the results from the screen are summarized in table  <dig>  the new pcr assay was able to correctly confirm all the e. sakazakii isolates tested. there were no amplification products observed when the non e. sakazakii strains controls were similarly analyzed.

for comparison the various strains were also similarly analyzed using the pcr system described by keyser et al.  <cit> . the results are summarized in table  <dig> and confirm our preliminary evaluation data where we found significant specificity problems with this system. a gel-based example of the screen is shown in figure  <dig>  where e. sakazakii isolates and non-target microorganisms were analyzed. first the system was not able to detect all the e. sakazakii strains. by using the probe_match tool included in the arb software it can be retrieved, that one of the primers  used in the keyser system exhibits four mismatches at the  <dig> prime end to the 16s rrna gene sequence of e. sakazakii strain atcc  <dig>  thus providing a possible explanation for the negative amplification result with this strain. moreover, this system also gives positive results with some non-target organisms .

to determine the detection limit of the newly developed assay, pcr was performed on decreasing amounts of purified dna template from representatives of the two e. sakazakii lineages . in both strains a detection limit of  <dig> pg was determined . furthermore the influence of non-specific dna background on the assay's detection limit and efficiency was also investigated. the target dna template concentration was held constant at  <dig> pg while increasing amount of non-target dna, purified templates from b. cereus atcc  <dig>  l. acidophilus atcc  <dig>  s. aureus atcc  <dig> and e. faecium dsm  <dig> were used. there were no significant influences on assay's performance observed in the presence of up to  <dig> ng non-target dna in the reaction mixture .

CONCLUSIONS
by phylogenetic analysis of the new provided full-length 16s rrna sequence data we could show the presence of a second phylogenetic distinct lineage within the e. sakazakii species. based on this new sequence data we have developed a 16s rrna targeting pcr assay, which allows identification of e. sakazakii strains from both lineages. the assay's ability to correctly identify different e. sakazakii isolates as well as to differentiate e. sakazakii from other closely related enterobacteriaceae species and other non-target microorganisms was shown. this pcr system provides a valuable tool for rapid identification of this food borne pathogen.
