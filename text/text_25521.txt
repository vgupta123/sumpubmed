BACKGROUND
rheumatoid arthritis  is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints and surrounding tissues. about  <dig> - <dig> % of the adult population is affected by the disease  <cit> . it is the second most common type of arthritis which often starts after  <dig> years of age and before  <dig> years of age  <cit> . in common with multiple sclerosis and type- <dig> diabetes, ra is an autoimmune disease with unknown etiology. the factors leading to the development of ra remain unknown, although environmental factors, such as smoking and diet have been implicated  <cit> . autoimmune diseases are caused when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. for ra, the tissues under attack are the synovial membranes around joints which become swollen, stiff, red and painful leading to joint destruction and functional disability.

the first written reference to arthritis, dated  <dig> ad described symptoms very similar to what we know now as rheumatoid arthritis. an ancient indian text, caraka samhita describes a disease where swollen, painful joints initially strike the hands and feet, then spreads to the body, causing loss of appetite, and occasionally fever  <cit> . in  <dig>  a french physician, a.j. landré-beauvais wrote the first recognized description of rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . the clinical term 'rheumatoid arthritis' was coined by alfred garrod, the london rheumatologist, making the first reference in medical literature  <cit> .

many autoantibodies that react against various autoantigens are detectable in the sera of ra patients  <cit>  and are useful in diagnosis of the disease. diagnosis at the early stage of the disease can prevent irreversible joint damage, reducing signs and symptoms of erosion and improving physical function  <cit> . historically, rheumatoid factor is an important serological marker for the diagnosis of ra and is still used as one of the criteria for the classification of the disease  <cit> . it can be found in most of the ra patients, but it is not a specific marker for ra. it can also be seen in other bacterial, viral, parasitic diseases and other inflammatory conditions  <cit> . for disease diagnosis, it is a good but not ideal marker for ra and better markers are needed.

anticitrullinated protein autoantibody  has been documented as a highly specific marker for ra and has diagnostic and prognostic potential. several studies have proven the diagnostic value of ra  <cit> . acpa can be detected at the early phases of the disease, even before the onset of symptoms. post-translational conversion of an arginine residue generates peptidylcitrulline  which is recognized by acpa. the process is called citrullination or deimination. it is catalyzed by a calcium binding enzyme called protein arginine deiminase type  <dig> .

studies have been performed by several research groups to explore the connection of pad <dig> with the disease based on ethnicity. polymorphism in padi <dig>  the gene encoding pad <dig>  is found to be associated with ra. studies show that the gene is associated with ra susceptibility in asians including koreans, japanese, and chinese  <cit> . most of the studies demonstrated the association of padi <dig> with ra among asian populations but not the caucasian population  <cit> . in a study carried out by iwamoto et al.  <cit> , they found a positive association between padi <dig> and ra in population of european descent. chang et al.,  <cit>  showed that the expression of padi <dig> in the synovial fluid of ra patients is higher than patients of another two types of arthritis, osteoarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.

to date, there is no known cure for ra. current available treatments are mainly focused on pain relief. current treatments available for ra can be classified into three groups: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , corticosteroids, and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs   <cit> . the most common and useful dmard is methotrexate . it is the preferred drug for current ra treatment but causes side effects such as nausea, mouth ulcers and hair loss. with hope of curing the disease, pad <dig> has become the new therapeutic target for ra. pad <dig> catalyzes the citrullination process which generates the epitope for ra. by inhibiting the activity of pad <dig> it should be possible to control the development of ra.

with the discovery of pad <dig> as a promising target for the treatment of ra, structure-based drug design can be carried out to search for new potential drug leads  <cit> . the cost of the process is relatively low, not requiring high initial outlays or complex synthesis efforts  <cit> . in this research, inhibitors of pad <dig> were searched for using a high-throughput virtual screening program - lidaeus   <cit> . this program screened approximately  <dig> million commercially available compounds against the active site of pad <dig>  potential compounds were then screened experimentally using an enzyme inhibition assay. from computer-aided virtual screening, a number of compounds were identified as weak inhibitors of the enzyme, pad <dig> 

RESULTS
expression and purification of pad4
the majority of the protein expressed by the e. coli system was in inclusion bodies  <cit> . there are  <dig> cysteines in pad <dig> that cause the correct folding of the enzyme, this presented difficulties as random disulfide bonds formation between cysteins induces incorrect protein folding and aggregation, often producing insoluble and inactive protein. therefore, the medium used for pad <dig> expression was altered in order to produce properly folded protein. studier media  <cit> , which provides milder conditions for protein expression without the use of iptg yielded more soluble protein compared to the conventional protein expression system. pad <dig> consists of  <dig> amino acids and the theoretical molecular weight of the enzyme is  <dig>  kda. the pad <dig> expressed from the system was attached with trx-his-s-tags. the molecular weight of the tagged pad <dig> was approximately  <dig> kda as shown by sds-page analysis. the purity of the obtained enzyme was high, approximately 90% after one step of purification, with recovery of 79% activity. about  <dig> mg of pad <dig> was isolated from  <dig> ml of culture after purification. the enzymatic activity of purified pad <dig> was determined by citrulline colorimetric assay and the protein content was checked by bradford protein assay. one unit of pad <dig> was defined as the amount of pad <dig> needed to produce  <dig> μm of nα-benzoylcitrulline ethyl ester from n-α-benzoylarginine ethyl ester  per hour  <cit> .

high-throughput virtual screening using lidaeus
lidaeus was utilized to search for inhibitors of pad <dig>  lidaeus searched for inhibitors using a structure-based approach. sitepoints and energy maps were generated and used to fit and score around  <dig> million commercially available small molecules into the active site of pad <dig>  the top  <dig> compounds obtained after docking by lidaeus were extracted and re-docked with the more exhaustive docking software autodock  <cit> .

initially lidaeus performed the docking using a course-grained approach that is essentially rigid body docking   <cit> , which enables the screening of large datasets. to get around the rigid-rigid limitation, lidaeus docks the small molecules into the active site using multiple pre-generated conformations . after lidaeus identified potential inhibitors of pad <dig> from the database, more accurate analysis was carried out using autodock for flexible ligand docking. the compounds were ranked again after docking using autodock according to their predicted binding affinity to pad <dig> 

in structure-based ligand screening, one must be careful in choosing the most suitable protein structure from the protein data bank, particularly if one is working with a protein target represented in multiple crystal structures. it is well known that many proteins undergo conformational changes upon binding to ligands, cofactors, or metal ions. these structural rearrangements may open the binding pocket of the protein, often referred to as a "closed" to "open" transition. choosing a representation of the protein in its "open" conformation may cause misidentification of active ligands as a result of the inability of the ligand to bind in the "closed" form of the binding pocket. after carefully analyzing several crystal structures of pad <dig> available in the protein data bank, the crystal structure of pad <dig> in complex with ca2+ and benzoyl-l-arginine amide   was chosen for our structure-based screening and docking. this structure represents the highest resolution structure available at the time of writing. there are five ca2+ binding sites identified in the structure of pad <dig> with the protein undergoing massive structural rearrangements upon binding to ca2+  <cit> . the attachment of these cations induces conformational changes that open a cleft in the pad <dig> active site, subsequently allowing ligand to enter the active site. however, 1wda structure has a cys645ala mutation. therefore, we performed an in-silico ala645cys mutation on the 1wda structure using coot  <dig> . <dig>  matching the human pad <dig> sequence. the coot program allows amino acid mutation with consideration given to side-chain rotamer positions.

the active site of pad <dig> has been studied by many research groups  <cit>  with the goal of understanding the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. knuckley et al.,  <cit>  suggested that pad <dig> utilizes a reverse protonation mechanism. they claimed that cys <dig> and his <dig> are essential for substrate binding. inhibitors proposed by luo et al.  <cit>  were designed to block cys <dig> from binding with the substrate.

potential inhibitors obtained from lidaeus were not targeted to any specific amino acid of the active site. site points generated in the active site are used to define energetically favourable locations for specific atom types, taking into account contributions from van der waals, hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. potential inhibitors were indentified using lidaeus as a course grained  docking technique, followed by a more rigorous treatment with autodock.

inhibitory activity of hits
after potential in-silico hit identification, a quick experimental screen was carried out. one of the criteria for a drug is that it has to be soluble in aqueous medium. drugs with poor aqueous solubility are likely to have absorption problems since the flux of drugs across the intestinal membrane is proportional to concentration gradients between the intestine lumen and blood  <cit> . from the top  <dig> compounds obtained after molecular docking,  <dig> aqueous soluble compounds were selected for quick screening. to perform quick screening, an inhibition assay was carried out and the activity of pad <dig> after inhibition was compared with a negative control. compound concentration was fixed at  <dig> μm and the percentage of pad <dig> activity remaining after adding inhibitor calculated. additional file 1: table s <dig> shows the ids, rankings, structures, and binding affinities of the compounds tested in this work.

a known pad <dig> inhibitor was chosen for this work as a positive control. a disease modifying anti rheumatic drug, streptomycin, with the reported half maximal inhibitory concentration  value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm against pad <dig>  <cit>  was selected for this purpose. compounds that significantly reduced pad <dig> activity were considered as potential inhibitors. out of  <dig> compounds, there were three compounds  that showed significant inhibition of pad <dig> , reducing pad <dig> activity by more than 5% at  <dig> μm . the binding affinities of compounds  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with pad <dig> as calculated by autodock were - <dig> , - <dig> , and - <dig>  kcal/mol, respectively. there is little molecular similarity present in the three top inhibitors, apart from the presence of oxygen-containing ring. these three compounds were further studied for their potency in inhibiting pad <dig> enzymatic activity. ic <dig> values for the compounds were determined by inhibition assays using various inhibitor concentrations. the data obtained were fitted into a standard ic <dig> equation in the grafit program  <cit>  to calculate relative ic <dig> values. figure  <dig> shows the concentration - response curve of the compounds. ic <dig> values calculated by the program for compounds  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mm, respectively. the absolute ic <dig>  which is the concentration of the inhibitor that brings the activity of the enzyme down to 50%, were estimated from graphs. the estimated absolute ic <dig> values for compound  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mm, respectively.

molecular docking analysis of hits
compound  <dig> with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  mm forms five hydrogen bonds and four hydrophobic interactions with residues in the binding site of pad <dig> . two hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chain carboxylic acid of asp <dig> and the side chain thiol of cys <dig> with the hydroxyl group of compound  <dig>  two hydrogen bonds are also formed between the backbone oxygen of his <dig> and the side chain carboxylic acid of glu <dig> with the amine group of the inhibitor. another hydrogen bond is formed between the side chain amine of asn <dig> with an oxygen atom in the ether ring of compound  <dig>  compound  <dig>  which shows strongest binding to pad <dig> as indicated by its low ic <dig> value forms eight hydrogen bonds with residues in the binding site . four hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chain carboxylic acid of asp <dig>  the side chain thiol of cys <dig>  and side chain amine of asn <dig> with two hydroxyl groups in compound  <dig>  two hydrogen bonds are formed between the backbone oxygen of his <dig> and the side chain carboxylic acid of glu <dig> with amine in the thioazolidine ring of the inhibitor. another hydrogen bond is also formed between sulfur atom of the thioazolidine ring with the side chain amine of asn <dig>  one hydrogen bond is formed between the backbone amine of ala <dig> with oxygen in the furan ring of compound  <dig>  as for compound  <dig>  there are three hydrogen bonds formed with residues in the binding pocket, i.e. one interaction between the backbone amine of val <dig> and the nitro group of the inhibitor, another hydrogen bond between the same nitro group with the side chain carboxylic acid of glu <dig>  and one hydrogen bond between the backbone oxygen of his <dig> and hydroxyl group of the compound . there are five conserved residues that bind to compounds  <dig> and  <dig>  indicating that both compounds bind to the same location. in contrary, compound  <dig> binds to different residues indicating that this compound sits in different part of the pad <dig> binding site.

our docking results show that all three compounds have different predicted binding modes than that of baa  and f-amidine, the most potent irreversible pad <dig> inhibitor ever reported  <cit> . poseview analysis shows that baa interacts with six residues in the binding site of pad <dig> and only three of them were predicted to interact with the compounds reported in this work, i.e., asp <dig>  his <dig>  and cys <dig>  the same analysis shows that f-amidine interacts with five residues in the binding site of pad <dig>  only two of them interacting with compounds in this work, i.e., val <dig> and cys <dig> . the difference in binding orientation between baa and f-amidine compared to three compounds that we discovered could be due to the uniqueness of the pad <dig> binding pocket, discussed below .

discussion
to date, the therapies available for ra treatment are merely treating its symptoms  <cit> . the discovery of anticitrullinated protein autoantibody as a specific autoantibody to ra has led to the discovery of pad <dig> as a new therapeutic target for ra. it is hoped that inhibitors of pad <dig> can treat the underlying cause of the disease. the catalytic mechanism of pad <dig> was investigated  <cit>  in order to identify important features that could be exploited for inhibitor development.

the discovery of drugs can be accelerated by the use of computational methods in lead identification and optimization. high-throughput screening  is a conventional experimental method which identifies leads by carrying out individual biochemical assays with more than millions compounds. it is a good method for the identification of leads but is costly and time consuming. this leads to the integration of another computational methodology, namely virtual high throughput screening   <cit> . vhts is a computational screening method widely used to screen in-silico collections of compounds and predict binding affinities of library compounds to the target receptor. vhts aims to operate on millions of compounds in a short period of time. hts and vhts are complementary methods; hts confirms the accuracy of vhts predictions.

vhts has been performed in many projects searching for therapeutics - for example, nuclear hormone receptor antagonists for cancer, diabetes and neurological diseases  <cit> , ck <dig> inhibitors as antitumor agents  <cit> , 17β-hydroxysteroid dehyrogenase type  <dig> inhibitors for breast cancer  <cit> , and tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1a inhibitors for down's syndrome  <cit> . lidaeus, the structure-based vhts program utilized in this work has been previously employed in drug discovery efforts searching for cdk inhibitors   <cit> , cyclophilins inhibitors for hiv infection  <cit> , and ns <dig> methyltransferase for dengue fever  <cit> .

this work is the first report on the usage of structure-based virtual screening to discover novel inhibitors against pad <dig>  in this work, instead of synthesizing new compounds, we searched for inhibitors of pad <dig> using the lidaeus program. the "drug universe"  consists of  <dig> molecules  <cit> . it is believed that potential drugs can be identified from the large "drug universe" without synthesizing more new compounds. the hit rate in our work is 14%, which is similar to previous work performed using lidaeus  <cit>  followed by more rigorous docking treatments. the results obtained from vhts using lidaeus were not in agreement with the experimental screening, where the top virtually screened compounds do not always turn out as hits after enzymatic screening. there is a lack of correlation between autodock binding affinity and the inhibitory activity of the compounds . we discovered that the most active hits were compounds  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  with ic <dig> values in milimolar range. the non-existence of a straightforward correlation between high ranked compounds in vhts and their inhibitory activity, and the weak binding of three compounds discovered through this work are somewhat disappointing. nevertheless, the findings of this work may provide useful scaffolds for designing more potent inhibitors against pad <dig> and most importantly provide insights into structure-based virtual screening for similar protein targets. the rationale behind disagreement between our vhts and inhibitory assay results, and weak binding of three inhibitors identified using lidaeus could be attributed to limitations in our methodology as well as unique structural features of the pad <dig> binding site hindering structure-based ligand search strategies. first, lidaeus omits water molecules in its screening process, and this may contribute to ligand-water interactions being ignored. it is known that water molecules play an important role in protein-ligand binding; however, the difficulties in exact positioning of explicit water molecules around proteins result in most existing docking and scoring functions using crude approximations for reasons of speed and efficiency. second, the outstanding issue of protein flexibility in the docking protocol may play a significant role in predicting properties of hit compounds  <cit> . lidaeus does not take protein flexibility into account.

from a protein structure point of view, the shape of the pad <dig> binding pocket makes structure-based ligand screening somewhat difficult. the active site of pad <dig> is characterized by its u-shape and has two doors: the "front door" that is used by pad <dig> substrates and amidine inhibitors to bind and affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme, and the "back door" that provides another access into the critical residues in the active site of pad <dig> . our autodock results for compounds  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show that these compounds bind to the "back door" of the u-shaped binding pocket of pad <dig> down at the bottom of the pocket without significantly blocking the "front door", which causes the pad <dig> active site to remain open. this could be the reason why strong binding affinities predicted for the three compounds are not translated into actual inhibitory activity. however, it is interesting to see that several compounds from our screening efforts with autodock with predicted binding poses at the "front door" of pad <dig> did not produce any inhibitory activity in our assay . a similar scenario happens with streptomycin, a weak pad <dig> inhibitor that was postulated to bind into pad <dig> active site, presumably at the "front door", based on kinetic study data  <cit> . despite the proposed mechanism of pad <dig> catalysis that is well accepted and supported by experimental results, a comprehensive understanding on how pad <dig> is inhibited is still far from complete.

nevertheless, we have identified several compounds as potential therapeutics for ra. by comparing the compounds with reported inhibitors  <cit> , there is no similarity between reported inhibitor structures and potential inhibitors discovered in this work. luo et al.  <cit>  proposed amidine inhibitors containing halogens capable of forming a stable thiother adduct between the inhibitor and cys <dig>  which has been suggested as an essential amino acid in the citrullination process  <cit> . initially, it was thought that ideal pad <dig> inhibitors must be able to penetrate deeply into the active site of pad <dig> where cys <dig> is located, this scenario is only possible if the inhibitors mimic the structure of an arginine side chain. amidine derivatives were discovered by mimicking the structure of benzoylarginine amide, an arginine-containing pad <dig> substrate. however, later findings show that there are compounds without any similarity with arginine show significant inhibition against pad <dig> in micromolar scale, such as streptomycin, minocycline, chlortetracycline, and streptonigrin that shows multiple fold higher inhibitory activity against pad <dig> than that of amidine compounds  <cit> . these facts suggest that potential pad <dig> inhibitors may be identified by the presence of a warhead that protrudes into the deep binding site of pad <dig> and subsequently forms a stable bond with cys <dig>  thus completely blocking the action of pad4; however, that is not an absolute prerequisite for a pad <dig> inhibitor as has been show by the efficacy of larger molecules such as streptomycin, minocycline, chlortetracycline, and streptonigrin in inhibiting pad <dig> activity.

in this work we found few compounds that inhibit the activity of pad <dig>  none of these compounds mimic the structure of arginine or previously discovered pad <dig> inhibitors. compound  <dig> and  <dig> contain five-membered rings while compound  <dig> contains furan  and thiazolidine rings. furan rings are found in many natural products and synthetic drug molecules  <cit> . zeni et al.,  <cit>  synthesized a series of compounds containing furan rings and studied their anti-inflammatory behavior. they tested the compounds using the carrageenin-induced paw edema method, and discovered that several compounds exhibited greater potency than classical anti-inflammatory agents in inhibiting paw edema formation. a furan-containing compound synthesized by closse et al.  <cit> , 5-chloro-6-cyclohexyl- <dig> -dihydrobenzofuran-2-one, was more active than the reference compounds, indomethacin and diclofenac in inhibiting the acute inflammation and the adjuvant-induced arthritis. wakimoto et al.,  <cit>  proposed that furan fatty acids could be potential antioxidants which may prevent chronic inflammatory diseases.

the thioazolidine ring, which is present in compound  <dig>  possesses a wide range of promising biological activities. thiazolidine has shown its importance as an antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antimalarial, analgesic, anti-hiv and anticancer agent  <cit> . thiazolidine dione was identified as a compound which has high potency in suppressing chronic inflammation and joint destruction  <cit> . the compound has been studied for its antiarthritic activity against rat adjuvant arthritis which is a chronic t cell-dependent autoimmune disease with many similarities to rheumatoid arthritis and exhibited activity at daily oral doses between  <dig>  and  <dig> mg/kg  <cit> . ma et al.,  <cit>  synthesized a series of thiazolidene diones and examined the antiarthritic potency of the most active compound with adjuvant induced arthritis. rats treated with thiazolidine compound did not develop severe arthritis after adjuvant injection, loss of body weight was also reduced significantly. this indicated that the compound exhibited potential immunomodulating activity.

the ic <dig> values of the inhibitors discovered in this work were lower compared to existing drugs for ra treatment. the most common recently used drug for ra treatment is methotrexate with an ic <dig> value of more than  <dig> mm  <cit> . paclitaxel showed inhibition to pad isolated from bovine brain with ic <dig> value of approximately  <dig> mm. besides methotrexate and paclitaxel, other dmards such as sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and 5-aminosalicylic acid were also investigated for their potency in inhibiting pad <dig>  <cit> . most of the dmards have high ic <dig> values. among the tested dmards, chlortetracycline showed the best inhibition of pad <dig> . although the three compounds discovered in this work have higher ic <dig> compared to chlortetracycline and amidine inhibitors, lidaeus has discovered a new class of compound that are able to inhibit pad <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have discovered three inhibitory compounds against pad <dig> through structure-based virtual screening using lidaeus. these compounds show ic <dig> values between  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm. the compounds have thioazolidine and cyclic ether groups in their structures, which may suggest the importance of those groups in inhibiting the enzymatic activity of pad <dig>  the compounds are commercially available and can be utilized as scaffold to design more potent pad <dig> inhibitors. the new class of pad <dig> inhibitors discovered during the course of this work provide a starting point not only for medicinal chemists, but for the future in-silico work based on molecular similarity and scaffold hopping. with binding modes predictable by virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening techniques feeding into structure-based techniques offer the ability to explore structure-activity relationship  using commercially available small molecules, greatly focusing medicinal chemistry efforts.
