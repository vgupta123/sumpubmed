BACKGROUND
human adenoviruses normally infect a wide variety of both dividing and nondividing cells. they replicate in and lyse their host cells to release newly generated progeny virus. although these properties are ideal for killing human cancer cells, virus replication must be restricted to malignant cells preferably without toxicity to normal surrounding cells. the clinical relevance is emphasized by the lack of an established effective therapy for serious, disseminated adenovirus infection  <cit> . oncolytic adenoviruses can be armed by therapeutic transgenes to augment their anticancer capacity  <cit> . furthermore they can enhance synergistically chemotherapy and/or radiation in a multimodal anti-neoplastic approach  <cit> . to improve the safety and the therapeutic index of replication-competent adenoviral vectors, many unique strategies have been developed in an attempt to achieve tumor selectivity  <cit> . in one approach, viral genes that are essential for viral replication are placed under the control of promoters that are preferentially active in tumor cells compared to the surrounding normal tissues.

after adenoviral infection, e1a is the first viral gene expressed, and its product trans-activates the other promoters of early genes allowing expression of late genes, upon which viral replication depends  <cit> . thus, the most commonly used strategy to construct conditionally replication-competent adenoviruses is to place only the adenoviral e1a region under the control of tissue/tumor-specific promoters  <cit> . since already small amounts of e1a gene products are sufficient to initiate adenoviral replication resulting in the accumulation of e1a gene products and thus driving viral replication  <cit> , leaky replication is frequently observed with this strategy. controlling both e1a and e1b genes with a tissue/tumor-specific promoter improves the tissue/tumor-specific replication of the virus  <cit> .

like the e <dig> gene products, the adenoviral e <dig> gene region is expressed early after infection and is an essential component of the viral life cycle. the adenoviral e <dig> and e <dig> gene products function in concert to create a cellular environment permissive for efficient expression and processing of viral gene products and ultimately a productive virus infection  <cit> .

several groups reported that controlling simultaneously the expression of e1a and e <dig> genes will provide a tighter control over virus replication  <cit>  and at the same time decreases the risk of generation of wild-type revertants. because of the difficulty in finding two active and tightly regulated promoters for a certain tumor type that maintain their specificity in the adenoviral genome  <cit>  several groups placed the e <dig> and e <dig> genes under the control of the same promoter  <cit> . others used two different heterologous promoters to control e <dig> and e <dig> expression  <cit> .

in a previous study  <cit>  we demonstrated that transcriptional targeting of solitary e1a resulted in ~50% improved vector targeting when compared to an unrestricted replication-competent adenovirus. furthermore, we showed that transcriptional targeting of adenoviral e1a and e <dig> with different promoters enhances vector targeting when compared to vectors using the same promoter.

in these studies, e <dig> and e <dig> double heterologous promoter controlled adenoviruses were generated by a lengthy sequential multistep cloning procedure to replace the viral e <dig> and e <dig> promoter  <cit> . another approach in e. coli involves a multistep modification of the transfer vector which had to be done for each inserted heterologous promoter individually  <cit> . aside from recombination systems in e. coli  <cit>  the adenoviral genome can also be modified efficiently in yeast  <cit> . fuerer et al. used a multistep recombination system in yeast to introduce multiple heterologous promoters/enhancers in the adenoviral genome  <cit> .

since among current methods there is no simple procedure to generate replication-competent adenoviral vectors with double heterologous promoters driving the viral e <dig> and e <dig> region, we developed based on the widely used adenoviral cloning system adeasy  <cit>  a transfer vector with two unique multiple cloning allowing the convenient insertion of heterologous promoters to transcriptionally target the expression of adenoviral e <dig> and e <dig> genes. in addition, the new transfer vector can accommodate a transgene, which is followed by an internal ribosomal entry site  upstream of the viral e1a transcription unit. this design has been used by us previously to generate replication competent adenoviral vectors encoding the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase , green fluorescent protein  or luciferase  <cit> . in the meantime we generated also double heterologous promoter controlled conditionally replication-competent adenoviral vectors encompassing a  <dig> bp deletion in the e1a conserved region  <dig> domain , corresponding to amino acids l122tcheagf <dig>  that is required for retinoblastoma protein  binding and release of e2f from prb, which is associated with cell proliferation  <cit> .

to evaluate the utility of our technology, we replaced the adenoviral e <dig> and e <dig> promoter with the cox- <dig> or ki- <dig> promoter, respectively. cyclooxygenase- <dig> , which is primarily responsible for prostaglandins produced in inflammatory sites and is virtually undetectable in most tissues under physiological conditions, is upregulated in breast, bladder, lung, pancreas, as well as colon cancer  <cit> . the ki- <dig> protein is exclusively expressed in proliferating cells and is therefore an important diagnostic tool for the detection of malignancies  <cit> . previously we demonstrated that the cox- <dig> and ki- <dig> promoter maintains their specificity in the adenoviral context  <cit> . in contrast to the often used cell cycle dependent e2f <dig> promoter, the activity of the ki- <dig> promoter is not influenced by the adenoviral e1a gene products, which release free e2f by interacting with prb  <cit> .

in this proof-of-concept study we demonstrated efficient and straightforward generation of oncolytic adenoviruses with e <dig> and e <dig> driven by heterologous promoters. we evaluated the adenoviruses ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki in vitro and in vivo. we will make the shuttle plasmids available to the scientific community for noncommercial purposes.

RESULTS
we constructed two shuttle plasmids with wild-type adenovirus e <dig> and the mutant e1Δ <dig>  <cit>  both allowing in a single homologous recombination step in e. coli to replace the viral e <dig> and e <dig> promoter with heterologous promoters . in this proof-of-concept study we evaluated the transfer vector pshuttle#4- <dig> with wild-type e <dig> by generating two replication-competent adenoviruses ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki based on the padeasy- <dig> adenoviral backbone.

analysis of promoter activity
before inserting the promoters for the cox- <dig> and ki- <dig> gene into our transfer vector pshuttle#4- <dig>  we confirmed the specificity of these promoters. for this we conducted transient dual luciferase reporter gene assays in the colorectal cancer cell line ht- <dig> and the pancreatic cancer cell line panc <dig>  primary normal human keratinocytes  served as a control. as shown in fig.  <dig>  when compared to the cmv-ie promoter, the median activity of the cox- <dig> promoter in these cells  was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. in cells arrested in g0/g <dig> or infected with ad <dig>  the activity of the cox- <dig> promoter did not change significantly . when compared to the cmv-ie promoter, the median activity of the ki- <dig> promoter in subconfluent cells was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. infection of the cells with ad <dig> had no significant effects on the activity of the ki- <dig> promoter . however, the activity of the ki- <dig> promoter was reduced to background levels in g0/g <dig> arrested cells . flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle distribution revealed that ~96% of the cells were in g0/g <dig> .

efficient generation of double heterologous promoter controlled adenoviruses
to place the adenoviral e <dig> and e <dig> genes under the transcriptional control of the cox- <dig> and ki- <dig> promoter we inserted these promoters in the appropriate multiple cloning site of our transfer vector generating pshuttle# <dig> cox•ki and pshuttle# <dig> ki•cox. to reduce promoter interference, we placed upstream of the promoters a synthetic polya site  <cit> .

after linearization of the transfer vectors, they were recombined with the adenoviral backbone plasmid padeasy- <dig> via their homologous dna in e. coli. the structure of the recombined plasmid pad.ki•cox with cleavage sites for the restriction endonucleases used for analysis is shown in fig. 3a. the plasmid pad.cox•ki is identical with the exception of the promoters for e <dig> and e <dig>  as shown in fig. 3b, restriction analysis of kanamycin resistant clones with hind iii demonstrated that only one out of  <dig> analyzed clones resulted from non-recombined transfer vector. restriction of the adenoviral plasmids pad.ki•cox and pad.cox•ki with pac i revealed that in  <dig> out of  <dig> and in  <dig> out of  <dig> recombinants homologous recombination occurred between the corresponding arms of shuttle and adenoviral backbone plasmid. in the other cases, recombination occurred between the ori sequences shared by the transfer vector and the adenoviral backbone plasmid padeasy- <dig> and the corresponding right arms. in these clones the native viral e <dig> promoter has not been replaced with the heterologous promoter of interest.

as shown in fig. 3c we further analyzed the recombinants pad.ki•cox and pad.cox•ki by spe i and swa i double digestion to release the heterologous promoter driving the viral e <dig> region. electrophoretic analysis resulted in a fragment in the length of the cox- <dig> promoter  and ki- <dig> promoter  with upstream polya, as well as in a  <dig>  kb and a  <dig>  kb fragment. the heterologous promoter driving the viral e <dig> region is incorporated in the ~ <dig>  kb cla i fragment. because neither padeasy- <dig> nor the shuttle plasmid contains the native viral e <dig> promoter, recombinants encoding e <dig> under the transcriptional control of the native viral e <dig> promoters are not possible in e. coli.

since both the cox- <dig> and the ki- <dig> promoter were active in subconfluent  <dig> cells, we used these cells to rescue recombinant replication-competent adenoviruses, as described previously  <cit> . as shown in fig. 3d we verified the genomic integrity of the rescued infectious adenoviruses ad.ki• cox and ad.cox•ki by pcr amplification of the ki- <dig> and cox- <dig> promoter sequences with upstream polya. the size of the pcr amplified fragments were  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, as expected. ad <dig> served as negative control.

adenoviral cytopathic effect assay
we determined the ad <dig> transduction efficiency of all cell lines used in this study. for this cell monolayers were incubated for  <dig> hours with ad.gfp at an moi of  <dig>  pfu/cell . in ht- <dig>  panc <dig>  pac and  <dig> cells the median fraction of gfp positive was ~45%. under the same conditions, the median transduction efficiency of ppc and primary human keratinocytes  was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

since all vectors are based on ad <dig> and thus penton base and fiber which determine the infection efficiency on the viral side are identical, we used the transduction efficiency with ad.gfp for individual infection conditions for each cell line to compensate for differences in adenoviral transduction efficiency. with the ad.gfp vector we verified the applicability of our predicted compensation .

to determine the adenoviral cytopathic effect, monolayers of ht- <dig>  panc <dig> and hkc were infected with serial dilutions of dl <dig>  ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki. as shown in fig. 4a, ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki demonstrated lysis of ht- <dig> and panc <dig> cell monolayers. the lytic effect of ad.cox•ki in both cell lines tested was slightly greater than that of ad.ki•cox. furthermore, the lytic effect of the recombinant adenoviruses in ht- <dig> and panc <dig> was similar to that of dl <dig>  in contrast, in primary human keratinocytes, the cytopathic effect of the adenoviruses ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki was greatly reduced when compared to dl <dig> 

since permanent cell lines might have changed their characteristics over time, we verified our cytopathic effect assay also in primary pancreatic carcinoma cells . as a control for normal cells we used primary adenoid cells  in addition to hkc . infection of ppc cells with dl <dig>  ad.ki•cox, or ad.cox•ki resulted in complete lysis of the cell monolayers. furthermore, infection of the non-neoplastic hkc or pac cells with dl <dig> caused complete cytopathic effect. in contrast, infection of the monolayers with the viruses ad.ki•cox or ad.cox•ki did not cause any significant cell lysis, with the exception of ad.cox•ki in hkc cells where a slight cytopathic effect was visible.

in vivo evaluation of the oncolytic adenoviruses
furthermore we evaluated in an ht- <dig> subcutaneous colon carcinoma model in nude mice the oncolytic efficacy of the double heterologous promoter controlled vectors  and the adenoviral e3-deletion mutant dl <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  on day  <dig>  the median tumor volume of untreated animals was  <dig>  mm <dig>  the median tumor volume of animals treated with dl <dig>  ad.ki•cox, or ad.cox•ki was  <dig>  mm <dig>   <dig>  mm <dig>  and  <dig>  mm <dig>  respectively.

one-way analysis of variance  with tukey's hsd post hoc test revealed that the tumor volumes of all treatment groups receiving adenovirus were significantly smaller when compared to untreated animals . furthermore there was no statistical significant difference in the treatment efficacy of ad.ki•cox, ad.cox•ki and dl <dig> .

discussion
in the context of conditionally replication-competent adenoviral vectors, several groups reported that dual transcriptional targeting of viral e1a and e <dig> genes allows a significantly higher level of tumor specificity than solely targeting e1a or e <dig> genes  <cit> . in these studies, e <dig> and e <dig> double heterologous promoter controlled adenoviruses were generated by a timely multistep cloning procedure to replace the viral e1a and e <dig> promoter by tumor-/tissue-specific promoters in a sequential fashion. in this proof-of-concept study we demonstrated efficient and straightforward generation of conditionally replication-competent adenoviruses with e <dig> and e <dig> genes driven by heterologous promoters.

previous studies demonstrated that not all promoters are suitable for the transcriptional targeting of adenoviral e <dig> gene products  <cit>  and that heterologous promoters might lose their specificity in the adenoviral context  <cit> . therefore it is likely that several adenoviral vectors with different heterologous promoters have to be generated and evaluated for their tumor specificity. thus our system will be valuable for the generation of conditionally replication-competent adenoviral vectors with e <dig> and e <dig> driven by tumor-/tissue-specific promoters.

dependent on the used adenoviral backbone plasmid, i.e. padeasy- <dig>  <cit>  or ptg <dig>  <cit> , our system allows generation of e3-deleted or wild-type e <dig> vectors.

deletion of the adenoviral e <dig> region allows insertion of larger promoters and/or transgenes but reduces also the intrinsic oncolytic capacity of these vectors  <cit> .

analogous to our oncolytic adenovirus vectors encoding hsv-tk, gfp or luciferase  <cit> , our system allows the incorporation of a transgene into the e1a transcription unit. this design allows high transgene expression. since the level of e1a expression has only a slight effect on virus replication  <cit> , in these vectors the replication was not significantly affected. in addition, mutations of the e <dig> region, e.g. Δe1b-55k  <cit>  or e1Δ24/dl922- <dig>  <cit> , can be easily incorporated into this system as long as this region is not present in the used adenoviral backbone plasmid .

as a proof-of-concept we generated with our novel transfer vector two adenoviruses ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki with the promoters of the ki- <dig> protein and the cyclooxygenase- <dig>  driving e <dig> and e <dig> and vice versa. we choose the cox- <dig> and ki- <dig> promoter since we did know from previous studies that these promoters maintain their specificity in the adenoviral genome and in the presence of adenoviral gene products  <cit> . furthermore, since for most tumors it is difficult to specify a truly tumor specific promoter we combined the tumor-/tissue-specific promoter cox- <dig> with a proliferation-associated ki- <dig> promoter to target viral replication and lysis to the transcriptional intersection of these two promoters.

the cox- <dig> promoter was active in the tested colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines, but not in human keratinocytes which we used as a control for normal cells. in contrast to the e2f promoter often used in oncolytic adenoviral vectors  <cit> , the ki- <dig> promoter is not activated in plasmid based reporter gene assays when over infected with wild-type ad <dig>  <cit> . to our knowledge this is the first report using this promoter in oncolytic adenoviral vectors.

in ~50% of the recombinants generated with our novel shuttle vector, the viral e <dig> promoter was replaced with the heterologous e <dig> promoter. in recombinants generated by homologous recombination of the shuttle plasmid and padeasy- <dig> ori sequences the viral e <dig> promoter will not be substituted with the heterologous promoter. the efficiency was influenced by the promoter sequence and length. up to now we were able to replace the viral e <dig> promoter efficiently with heterologous promoters of up to  <dig>  kb in length. using the adenoviral backbone plasmid padeasy- <dig> or ptg <dig>  heterologous sequences with a total length of up to  <dig>  kb or  <dig>  kb, respectively, can be inserted  <cit> .

in vitro, the constructed double heterologous promoter controlled replication-competent adenoviral vectors ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki demonstrated efficient lysis of the tested colon and pancreas cancer cell lines, but poor lysis in primary human keratinocytes . in contrast, the cytopathic effect caused by dl <dig> infection was similar in all cell lines tested. since permanent cell lines have been often in continuous culture for several years and thus are likely to have genetic aberrations, we established short-term cultures of primary pancreatic cancer cells. both recombinant adenoviruses and dl <dig> demonstrated efficient cell lysis of these cells. in contrast, ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki showed greatly reduced cell lysis in short-term cultures of primary adenoid cells and keratinocytes when compared to dl <dig>  because we compared the cytopathic effect of the ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki vectors to dl <dig>  we put special emphasis on the titer determination of dl <dig>  since an underestimation of dl <dig> titer would have put the specificity of the vectors ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki into doubt.

furthermore, since in all adenoviruses the e3- <dig> k protein  was deleted, which is required for efficient cells lysis and release of adenoviral progeny from infected cells  <cit>  and thus resulting in reduced viral replication kinetics when compared to wild-type ad <dig>  <cit> , the differences in cytopathic effect seen are clearly due to the promoter substitution.

we also evaluated in a subcutaneous ht- <dig> colon xenograft model in nude mice the oncolytic activity of the viruses ad.ki•cox, ad.cox•ki and dl <dig>  the key findings were: first, intratumoral injections of replication-competent adenoviruses resulted in a significant anti-tumor response when compared to untreated animals, confirming that replication-competent adenoviruses have a direct oncolytic activity  <cit> . second, the anti-neoplastic efficacy of the unrestricted replication-competent dl <dig> virus was similar to that of the vectors ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki. third, although at any given time only a fraction of tumor cells are in s phase there was no significant difference in the anti-neoplastic efficacy of ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated in our proof-of-concept study that our novel transfer vector allows efficient and straight forward generation of double heterologous promoter controlled adenoviruses in a single homologous recombination step in bacteria. dependent on the used adenoviral backbone plasmid, i.e. padeasy- <dig> or ptg <dig>  our system allows generation of e3-deleted or wild-type e <dig> vectors. the rescued infectious adenoviruses demonstrated preferential lysis of tumor cells, thus confirming previous reports on restriction of adenoviral replication by transcriptional targeting of the viral e1a and e <dig> region. the use of tumor-specific promoters to control the expression of viral genes pivotal for replication is a promising method for the construction of therapeutic viruses.
