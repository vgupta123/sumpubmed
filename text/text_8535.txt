BACKGROUND
two-component systems  have emerged as important signal response mechanisms in higher plants  <cit> . tcss were originally described in prokaryotic systems, where they perceive and process a wide range of environmental signals  <cit> . in plants, canonical tcss play major roles in mediating physiological responses to hormones, such as cytokinin and ethylene  <cit> , nutrients  <cit>  and light  <cit>  and are also important for the ethylene and h2o <dig> triggered stomatal closure response  <cit> . furthermore, tcs elements maintain the pace of the circadian clock and mediate the input of the cytokinin signal to its circadian phase  <cit> . tcs components have also been shown to be important for the regulation of several developmental processes, such as the control of the number of stem cells in the shoot apical meristem  <cit> , the development of the female gametophyte  <cit> , the differentiation of root vascular tissue  <cit>  and the formation of root nodules during rhizobium/plant interaction  <cit> .

analysis of the genome of arabidopsis thaliana and other plants has revealed sequences encoding proteins that are homologues to all three elements required to establish the complex type of two-component system and a his-to-asp phosphorelay: the hybrid histidine kinases , the histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins  and the response regulators . the arrs are further subdivided into three discrete groups, the a-type arrs and b-type arrs  <cit>  and a novel group of arrs consisting of arr <dig> and arr <dig>  the receiver domains of arr <dig> and arr <dig> have higher similarity to the receiver domains of hybrid histidine kinases than to those of the other response regulators  <cit> .

the capacity of tcs proteins to act within a phosphorelay, as histidine kinases, phosphotransfer proteins, response regulators or phospho-histidine phosphatases has been demonstrated for representative members of each group  <cit> . most of the present data can be combined to an attractive, general model of tcs signalling as it is exemplarily proposed for the cytokinin response pathway  <cit> : upon activation by its appropriate stimulus the ahk undergoes autophosphorylation at a conserved his residue in its transmitter domain. the phosphoryl residue is then transferred to a his in the ahps via an asp in the receiver domain of the ahk. the ahps distribute the phosphoryl residue to either nucleo-cytoplasmic a-type arrs, nuclear b-type arrs or, as exemplarily demonstrated for ahp <dig>  can be dephosphorylated by arr <dig> in vitro.

in arabidopsis, the canonical tcs elements are encoded by multigene families. whereas the ahp family consists of  <dig> members, the a-type and b-type arrs subfamilies are each represented by  <dig> members. the b-type arrs are transcription factors acting as partially redundant positive regulators of cytokinin signal transduction by modulating the expression of cytokinin response genes, including type-a arrs  <cit> . recently, hutchinson and colleagues  <cit>  reported that ahps also function as partially redundant positive regulators of cytokinin signalling in arabidopsis. the a-type arrs, however, are proposed to be partially redundant negative regulators of cytokinin signalling  <cit>  but seem to have a more general function in the integration and coordination of several signalling processes, such as those of light  <cit> , the circadian clock  <cit>  and control of stem cell number  <cit> .

despite their generally redundant function in cytokinin signalling, some members of the a-type and b-type arrs show a highly specific expression pattern. for instance, the b-type response regulators arr <dig> and arr <dig> are expressed in developing anthers and in the tip of the pistil, respectively  <cit> . comparably, the expression of the response regulators arr <dig> and arr <dig>  which form a paralogous gene pair in arabidopsis, is proposed to be restricted to the funiculus/chalaza junction in the developing seed and pollen grains, respectively  <cit> . furthermore, arr <dig> functions as a phospho-histidine phosphatase on phosphorylated ahp <dig> in vitro  <cit> . despite this activity and specific expression, loss-of-function alleles of either arr <dig> or arr <dig>  displaying an aberrant but specific phenotype, could not be identified so far  <cit> . however, as reported by kiba and colleagues  <cit> , the ectopic expression of arr <dig> in arabidopsis induced a dwarf phenotype with a poorly developed root system and a de-regulation of cytokinin-responsive genes. this suggests that arr <dig>  when mis-expressed, interferes with the cytokinin response pathway in arabidopsis  <cit> .

in this study we show that arr <dig> is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, whose expression is restricted to the chalaza of developing seeds. surprisingly, the analysis of two novel arr <dig> loss-of-function alleles, with respect to seed development, nutrient content and composition, revealed no abnormalities. the interaction of arr <dig> with a subset of ahps and the different abnormal developmental phenotypes of transgenic arr <dig> plants complemented with a genomic arr <dig> fragment, however, suggest that even small traces of arr <dig>  expressed in non-chalaza tissues, greatly disturb the plants' tcs signalling network.

RESULTS
arr <dig> is specifically expressed in the chalaza of developing seeds
to define the spatial and temporal expression of arr <dig> in arabidopsis, we first performed quantitative rt-pcrs using rna from different tissues and developmental stages. the data demonstrated that the arr <dig> transcript was only detectable in flowers and more predominantly in siliques . subsequently, we translationally fused the arr <dig> promoter to the gfp gene. the used  <dig> bp long arr <dig> promoter fragment covered the entire sequence  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start and  <dig> bp of the 5' utr and was expected to contain all significant regulatory elements  <cit> . confocal laser scanning microscopy  of transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying this reporter construct indicated that gfp fluorescence was restricted to the chalaza cells of developing seeds . the activity of the arr <dig> promoter was first detectable in the seeds shortly after fertilization  and persisted through all the following developmental stages until the seed was shed. we also fused the arr <dig> promoter fragment to the uida reporter gene and generated parr22::uida-containing transgenic plants. the gus staining slightly extended to non-chalaza cells in the developing seeds. however, we could not detect specific gus activity in organs other than the developing seeds . to confirm the specific chalazal expression of arr <dig>  we performed fluorescence immunolabelling on 300â€“ <dig> nm cryosections of seeds from elongating siliques . the gfp protein was only detected in the chalaza indicating the spatially and temporally restricted expression of arr <dig> in arabidopsis . the observed parr <dig> activity pattern is supported by recent microarray data which demonstrate the accumulation of arr <dig> transcript solely in developing seeds  <cit> .

using the parr22::gfp reporter lines, we also tested the activity of the arr <dig> promoter in the chalaza in response to cytokinin and ethylene. for this purpose, we soaked excised inflorescences in either water or solutions containing different concentrations of cytokinin  or the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid. at different time points after hormone application we excised the siliques and analysed the chalaza for its fluorescence intensity. however, no induction of the arr <dig> promoter by cytokinin or ethylene was observed .

arr <dig> is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of plant cells
we next examined the subcellular localization of wild type arr <dig> and point-mutated versions in which the conserved phosphorylatable aspartate  was changed to either non-phosphorylatable glutamate  or asparagine . for this purpose, we expressed wild type arr <dig> fused to rfp and the modified arr22d74e and arr22d74n proteins fused to gfp, under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter, transiently in tobacco  leaf cells. for the verification and identification of the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments we used b-type arr2:gfp , ahk5:gfp  and gfp  as markers. the leaves were co-infiltrated with agrobacterium strains carrying either the rfp or gfp constructs and a strain conferring the expression of the silencing inhibitor gene p <dig>  <cit> . after transformation, the abaxial epidermis of the tobacco leaves was subjected to clsm. we observed a strong rfp fluorescence in the cytoplasm and a weaker signal inside the nucleus indicating that arr <dig> is predominantly a cytosolic protein as compared to the nuclear marker arr2:gfp protein . this subcellular localization of arr <dig> was not affected by the exchange of asp <dig> to glu or asn .

arr <dig> interacts with a subset of phosphotransfer proteins in yeast
to identify tcs partners of arr <dig> potentially involved in a chalaza-based phosphorelay, we screened for protein interactions in the yeast two-hybrid system. we cloned the arr <dig> cdna in the "bait" vector pgbkt7-dest and the cdnas of all ahps  as well as the cdna fragments encoding the histidine kinase  domain of the cytokinin receptors  and the ethylene receptor ers <dig> in the "prey" vector pgadt7-dest. the hk domain of the ahks and ers <dig> was used to address the question whether arr <dig>  which is more similar to the receiver domains of hybrid his kinases than to the receiver region of response regulators  <cit> , could interfere with either the hybrid his kinases or with ers <dig>  the only plant non-hybrid his kinase. the bd-arr <dig> construct was first transformed into the yeast strain pj69-4a and then a bd-arr <dig> expressing clone was re-transfected with the prey ad constructs shown in figure  <dig>  the interaction of the proteins was assessed by growth assay on interaction-selective media and measuring lacz reporter gene activity  . although all ad fusion proteins were expressed , only the yeast clones containing the ahp <dig>  ahp <dig> or ahp <dig> construct together with bd-arr <dig> grew on interaction selective medium and displayed Î²-galactosidase activity above the background level . no interaction of arr <dig> was found with ahp <dig>  ahp <dig> and ahp <dig> and the hk domains of the histidine kinases . furthermore, arr <dig> did not form homodimers in yeast .

arr <dig> interacts with ahp <dig>  ahp <dig> and ahp <dig> in plant cells
to substantiate the arr <dig> interactions observed in yeast, we studied protein-protein interactions in plant cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation . for this purpose, we generated 35s promoter-driven bifc constructs expressing arr <dig> in fusion with the c-terminal yfp fragment  and the ahp fusions with the n-terminal yfp fragment . western-blot analysis confirmed that the fusion proteins were co-expressed in n. benthamiana leaf cells in the presence of the p <dig> silencing inhibitor . as shown in figure 4a, a significant bifc signal and, thus, interaction was only observed when arr <dig> was co-expressed with ahp <dig>  ahp <dig> and ahp <dig>  no arr <dig> interaction was observed with ahp <dig>  ahp <dig> and ahp <dig> . thus, in support of our yeast data, arr <dig> showed specific interaction with a subset of ahps in planta and not with any of the other two-component signalling elements tested.

isolation and characterization of arr <dig> insertion mutants
for the further analysis of the arr <dig> function, we identified two t-dna insertion mutant alleles of the arr <dig> gene by screening the cologne collection, representing  <dig>  independent t-dna insertion lines in the col- <dig> ecotype  <cit> . both mutant lines  contained the t-dna insertion in the second intron of the arr <dig> gene . in the arr22- <dig> mutant the t-dna was inserted  <dig> bp downstream of the start codon, whereas in the arr22- <dig> line it was located  <dig> bp downstream of the start atg, corresponding to a position  <dig> bp upstream of the 3' splicing site of intron  <dig> . after the isolation of homozygous lines, rna from siliques was tested for the presence of the arr <dig> transcript by end-point rt-pcr . in contrast to wild type, no arr <dig> transcript was detected in either of the insertion mutant lines. the weaker band with slower electrophoretic mobility in the wild type preparation represents an additional arr <dig> transcript with an unspliced second intron  <cit> . a contamination with genomic dna was ruled out by pcr amplification without reverse transcription which did not produce arr <dig> amplicons. compared to wild type, however, both mutant lines showed no aberrant phenotype with respect to their vegetative development.

impact of the loss of arr <dig> function on seed development and nutrition
the function of the chalaza is to support the developing seed with nutrients  <cit> . therefore, we focused our further analysis on the seeds of the arr22- <dig> and arr22- <dig> mutants. however, we found no microscopically detectable difference in the size and morphology of the chalaza cells between the mutants and wild type. moreover, embryonic development was not affected in arr22- <dig> and arr22- <dig>  and the seeds also developed normally with respect to their size and mass . we next investigated whether the loss of arr <dig> function influences the metabolic state of the developing seeds. siliques from different developmental stages were collected, homogenized and lyophilized. the mutant and wild type siliques exhibited the identical dry mass at each developmental stage tested . the quantification of inorganic ions using hplc chromatography, revealed no significant difference between wild type and the arr <dig> mutants at any developmental stage . similarly, there was no significant difference with respect to the carbohydrate and and amino acid content . in conclusion, the loss of arr <dig> function in the chalaza has no major detectable impact on silique and seed development and the seeds' nutrient content and composition.

complementation of arr <dig> loss of function mutants results in dwarf and sterile plants
to genetically complement the insertion mutations, we introduced a genomic arr <dig> dna fragment into the arr22- <dig> and arr22- <dig> mutant lines. the arr <dig> genomic fragment extended from  <dig> bp upstream of the atg start codon to  <dig> bp downstream of the stop codon. the t <dig> population of more than  <dig> arr22- <dig> and arr22- <dig> transformants carrying the arr <dig> genomic construct  showed a broad phenotypic variation in contrast to the plants transformed with the empty vector . 22% of these transformants were dwarfed plants , 35% had a reduced rosette size  and 43% showed a normal rosette size . all category i and category ii plants were sterile. 78% of category iii plants were sterile and 5% showed wild type fertility. 17% of category iii plants had reduced fertility ranging from a few seeds to a few siliques per plant. the growth of the siliques in these plants was arrested at an early stage of development, and the abscission of the floral organs was delayed . a similar phenotype distribution was observed when the garr <dig> construct was transformed into wild type arabidopsis plants .

semi-quantitative rt-pcr using total rna fom the dwarf and sterile arr22/garr <dig> plants revealed that there was an over-accumulation of arr <dig> transcript in the apical inflorescence compared to wild type . we, subsequently, compared the seed development in arr22/garr <dig> transgenic and wild type plants using differential interference contrast microscopy. as shown in figure 9c, the female gametophyte developed phenotypic identically in the wild type and arr22/garr <dig> transgenic plants. in contrast to the wild type, the fully developed female gametophyte persisted longer in the arr22/garr <dig> transgenic plants, the central nucleus did not divide and both synergids degenerated at the time when the floral organs were abscissed . however, the few seeds, which were occasionally produced in the siliques of arr22/garr <dig> plants, were normal. in conclusion, our data suggest that a block of the fertilization, rather than a defect in early embryonic development, is the reason for arr22/garr <dig> plants' sterility.

the observed fertilization block was not due to a difference in pollen tube attraction because wild type and arr22/garr <dig> transgenic plants attracted gus-stained wild type pollen tubes to an identical extent . reciprocal crossing experiments, however, revealed that the fertilisation of emasculated wild type and arr22/garr <dig> plants using mature anthers from arr22/garr <dig> plants was not successful . the reason for this infertility was the anthers' physical resistance and reduced ability to open and to release the pollen rather than the sterility of the pollen . as arr <dig> is normally not expressed in anthers  <cit> , the observed phenotype does not provide information with respect to its native function.

to address the question, whether arr <dig> functions as a canonical response regulator or a histidine phosphatase in planta, we generated transgenic arr <dig> lines expressing arr <dig> variants, in which the phosphorylatable asp <dig> was mutated either to glu or asn. a glu mutation mimicks a phosphorylated asp and generates a dominant-active variant of a response regulator, whereas an asp-to-asn mutation mimicks a non-phopshorylated version, which acts dominant-negatively. the more than  <dig> independent arr <dig> plants carrying either the garr22d74e or garr22d74n construct did not show any developmental abnormalities but displayed the arr <dig> phenotype . these findings indicate that arr <dig> does not act as a canonical response regulator in planta.

discussion
arr <dig> gene expression and intracellular localisation of arr22
by using a parr22::gfp construct in combination with real-time rt-pcr and gfp immunolabelling, we located arr <dig> gene activity to the chalaza cells of developing arabidopsis seeds. this pattern is in general agreement with observation of gattolin and colleagues  <cit> , who also reported arr <dig> expression in the funiculus of developing seed using a parr22::gus reporter line. this difference in localisation could be due to a diffusion of the indigo stain out of the chalaza into the funiculus which we avoided in our transgenic line by using the gfp marker. our intracellular localisation studies revealed that 35s promoter-expressed arr22:gfp is predominantly but not exclusively located in the cytoplasm of plant cells. the mutation of the phosphorylatable asp <dig> to glu or asn had no effect on this pattern suggesting that the phosphorylation of arr <dig> does not influence its intracellular distribution.

arr <dig> interacts with a subset of ahps in yeast and plant cells
recently, kiba and colleagues  <cit>  reported that arr <dig> has strong phospho-histidine phosphatase activity on phosphorylated ahp <dig> in vitro. here we addressed the question whether arr <dig> may target ahp <dig> only or whether it also may interact with other arabidopsis tcs elements. yeast two-hybrid data showed that arr <dig> specifically interacts with ahp <dig>  ahp <dig> and ahp <dig> but not with ahp <dig>  ahp <dig> and ahp <dig> and the his kinase domains of ahk <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and ers <dig>  as indicated by the quantitative data, the interaction appears to be of low affinity and/or high kinetical dynamics. the in planta bifc data substantiated the specific interaction of arr <dig> with ahp <dig>  ahp <dig> and ahp <dig> and suggest that arr <dig> exerts its phospho-histidine phosphatase activity not only on ahp <dig>  <cit>  but probably also on ahp <dig> and ahp <dig>  ahp <dig>  ahp <dig> and ahp <dig> are expressed in siliques and developing seeds  <cit>  and are reported to be particularly important for arabidopsis seed development  <cit> .

arr <dig> mutants show no morphological, physiological, developmental and metabolic defects
we identified two novel arr <dig> mutant alleles and proved the absence of the arr <dig> transcript in their siliques. in comparison to the wild type, we could not detect any difference in the number, size and morphology of the chalaza cells during embryo development and we found no difference in seed size and silique mass in the mutants. a detailed metabolic analysis of ions, amino acids and carbohydrate content in the seeds also revealed no significant difference between arr <dig> mutant and wild type at any stage of seed development. these data show that arr <dig> is not involved in these processes. in the view of the extremely restricted arr <dig> expression in the chalaza and its phospho-histidine phosphatase activity, the lack of any detectable morphological and metabolic phenotype in the seeds of the arr <dig> mutants is surprising. a functional replacement of arr <dig> by its paralog, arr <dig>  in the chalaza is unlikely because arr <dig> gene activity is only observed in pollen and an arr22/arr <dig> double mutant also showed no phenotypic defects  <cit> .

genomic complementation of the arr <dig> mutants induces pleiotropic phenotypes
the complementation of the arr22- <dig> and arr22- <dig> mutants with a genomic arr <dig> fragment  resulted in t <dig> transformants with severe developmental abnormalities, such as dwarfism, delayed abscission of flower organs and a pollen release defect resulting in sterility. the inability of the arr22/garr <dig> anthers to release their pollen suggests a defect in the differentiation of the functional endothecium which is responsible for the rupture of the pollen sacs. the appearance of this pleiotropic phenotype depended on the presence of the phosphorylatable asp <dig>  <cit>  in garr <dig> and was not observed in arr22-2/garr22d74n and arr22-3/garr22d74e transgenic plants. this finding indicates that both the gain-of-function  and the loss-of-function mutants  of the response regulator have lost their biological activity. if arr <dig> functions as a canonical phospho-regulated response regulator like the a-type and b-type arrs, we would have expected to identify plants within the arr22/garr22d74e t <dig> transformant population showing a pleiotropic phenotype comparable to that of the arr22/garr <dig> t <dig> transformants. the absence of such a phenotype in the arr22/garr22d74e plants suggests that arr <dig> acts as a phospho-histidine phosphatase exclusively. this genetic finding is in accordance with the biochemical evidence that although arr <dig> is able to remove the phosphoryl residue from ahp <dig>  it does not use it for autophosphorylation  <cit> .

the pleiotropic arr22/garr <dig> phenotype is reminiscent to that of wol allele in ahk4/cre <dig> gene  <cit> , ahk2/ahk3/ahk <dig> triple cytokinin receptor mutants  <cit> , some higher order ahp  <cit>  and b-type arr mutants  <cit> . from these data we suggest that even small traces of arr <dig> in tissues, which normally do not contain the response regulator, may interfere with the hormone homeostasis and especially the cytokinin response pathway . mis-expression of arr <dig> appears to have a particular negative effect on vegetative growth and possibly on the differentiation of connecting tissues such as the endothecium of the anthers. the observed dramatic developmental defects can be explained by the action of arr <dig> as a very efficient ahp phosphatase and, therefore, as a strong phosphate "sink", which disturbs the two-component phosphorelay network in the extrinsic tissues . similarly, the enhanced phosphatase activity of the ahk <dig> receiver domain in the wol mutant is responsible for the wol phenotype  <cit>  .

an ectopic mis-expression of arr <dig> in the frame of a genomic fragment can occur when the transgene is inserted in transcriptionally active, more-or-less open chromatin areas, especially in 5'-promoter regions â€“ a process which is favoured by the selection of the transgenic plants  <cit> . this suggests that the activity of the arr <dig> locus might be under the tight control of chromatin condensation mechanisms, which restrict the expression of the response regulator to the chalaza. a similar regulation of gene activity is known for many tightly controlled developmental transformations during the plant's life cycle  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in our study, we provide evidence that arr <dig> is a predominantly cytoplasm-localised and strictly chalaza-expressed response regulator. furthermore, we substantiate by protein-interaction and genetic experiments earlier biochemical findings that arr <dig> has phospho-histidine phosphatase activity and functions on phosphorylated ahp <dig> and probably also on ahp <dig> and ahp <dig> in vivo. however, due to the absence of any chalaza- or seed-related aberrant phenotype in the arr <dig> mutants, the true function of arr <dig> remains currently obscure. because the slightest mis-expression in non-chalaza tissues produces "artificial" phenotypes, the use of genomic arr <dig> fragments or binary transactivation systems, such as the pop/lhg <dig> or alcr/alca system  <cit> , for functional analyses of arr <dig> is problematic. therefore, the targeted replacement of the endogenous arr <dig> gene by an  overexpression construct via homologues recombination is probably the only possible way to determine the in planta function. however, under the control of a tissue-specific and/or inducible promoter, the phospho-histidine phosphatase arr <dig> could be a useful tool for studying ahp <dig>   <dig> and 5-dependent tcs processes in plants.
