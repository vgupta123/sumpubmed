BACKGROUND
in crop plants more than 70% of seed nitrogen is remobilised and translocated from vegetative tissues such as stems and senescing leaves  <cit> . remobilisation of n follows different time courses, and contributions of various organs and tissues to n economy of developing seeds differ  <cit> . in cereals, flag leaves and glumes maintain their metabolic activity longer than other vegetative tissues, and their contribution to the final grain yield is high  <cit> .

up to 75% of reduced nitrogen in photosynthetically active leaf cells is located in the chloroplasts. ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  represents the major fraction of chloroplast nitrogen  <cit> . before nitrogen is exported to the phloem, rubisco must be degraded to peptides and amino acids  <cit> . gene expression analysis in wheat and barley identified several cysteine protease genes with enhanced transcript levels during leaf senescence  <cit> . certain c1a-type  cysteine proteases and possibly also s10-type serine carboxypeptidases are involved in bulk degradation of stromal proteins during leaf senescence  <cit> . both types of proteases are potentially synthesised at the endoplasmatic reticulum and channelled by the secretory pathway, which suggests routing to the lytic vacuolar compartment such as small senescence-associated vacuoles  <cit> . high expression and strong upregulation of genes encoding papain-like cysteine peptidases suggests an important role for especially those family members in naturally senescing barley leaves between  <dig> and  <dig> daf  <cit> .

during senescence, cellular proteins are degraded into peptides and amino acids. efficient partitioning of amino acids or peptides within the plant requires active transporters to transfer n compounds across cellular membranes  <cit> . for plants with fully sequenced genomes , the aramemnon database  <cit>  provides annotation and further information for the complete collection of putative n transporter genes, whereas to date only four sequences for putative barley n transporters are listed. based on sequence similarity, amino acid transporters were grouped into members of the atf  and the apc  families. the atf family can be further divided into aaps , lhts , proline transporters  as well as into transporters with substrates like γ-aminobutyric acid , aromatic and neutral amino acids  and indole-3-acetic acid   <cit> . subdivision of the apc family reveals transporters for cationic  and l-type amino acids , as well as the gaba permeases . overall  <dig>  and  <dig>  candidates cluster into these groups.

peptide transport in plants is accomplished by two gene families, the oligopeptide transporters  transporting tetra- and pentapeptides and transporters for di- and tripeptides belonging to the nitrate/peptide transporter family   <cit> . in arabidopsis and rice,  <dig> and  <dig> members belong to this group, while  <dig> and  <dig> transporters are annotated as opts. whereas a relatively high number of arabidopsis amino acid and nrt1/ptr transporters are functionally characterized  the information for monocots, especially for barley is scarce. the best characterised monocot peptide transporter is hvptr <dig> localized in the scutellum of barley grains and responsible for mobilisation of peptides from endosperm into germinating embryos  <cit> . osptr <dig> was shown to transport gly-his-gly  <cit> . from the opt family, only one monocot sequence  has been functionally characterised so far  <cit> .

numerous transporters contributing to iron trafficking in plants are described and were functionally characterised for grasses. this is due to the fact that grasses evolved a distinct mechanism to acquire fe from the soil best described as ‘chelation’ strategy  <cit> . strong fe chelators called phytosiderophores , are synthesised by the plant and secreted into the rhizosphere, where they bind fe. the fe-ps complex is than taken up by fe–ps uptake proteins  <cit>  called yellow stripe-like  transporters. several ysl transporters have been identified and characterised , among them the barley transporters hvysl <dig>  <cit> , hvysl <dig>  <cit>  and hvys <dig>  <cit> . the role of ysl transporters in remobilisation and grain filling is unclear yet. ysl transporters are distantly related to the opt family  <cit> . in arabidopsis and rice,  <dig> and  <dig> sequences belong to the ysl group.

although numerous plant amino acid and peptide transporters have been identified and some of them functionally characterised, it is difficult to determine which are the most important for plant n recycling on both the source and the sink side. for barley, this situation is even more complicated as the genomic sequence is only partially assembled  <cit> . furthermore, only  <dig> %  from  <dig>  barley ests in assembly  <dig> of harvest:barley v <dig>   represent sequences expressed in glumes and those  <dig>  ests  derived from leaf cdna libraries are not representative for remobilising flag leaves. sequence information from est collections might also be reduced for membrane-associated compounds because of high instability of respective e. coli clones.

next generation sequencing  technologies offer new opportunities to analyse plants without fully sequenced genomes. transcriptome large-scale parallel pyrosequencing was addressed to flag leaves, glumes and developing grains in order to analyse remobilisation and import of n compounds immediately before and after seed set. data evaluation was focussed on two specific groups of genes responsible for remobilisation and accumulation of nitrogen, cysteine peptidases and n transporters. combination of publicly available and rna-seq data reduced redundancy, increased length of gene-specific contigs and identified new members within the respective gene families. members of the aat gene family were over-represented in the set of rna-seq n transporter sequences. sequence alignment allowed to reconstruct  <dig> full-length aat genes. based on temporal expression profiling of these genes we hypothesise that establishment of high n-sink strength in developing grains is perceived in flag leaf and glumes, the tissues in close proximity to developing seeds. we postulate that metabolites communicate the increasing sink strength to the remobilising tissues by modulating transcript amounts as shown here for amino acid permeases. thus, aat gene activities might be involved in source/sink communication in barley. in addition, fluctuating transcript abundances of aat genes especially in flag leaves might reflect tissue-specific regulation of sink/source transition.

RESULTS
rna-seq and sequence assembly
mrna was prepared from barley flag leaves, glumes and caryopses collected at different stages of grain development. equal amounts of rna were combined from each stage at  <dig> day intervals, from  <dig> days before anthesis up to  <dig> days after flowering  for flag leaves and glumes, between anthesis and  <dig> daf for caryopses.

after quantification and quality control of the samples, reverse transcription and normalisation of the three libraries as well as transcriptome sequencing was performed by gatc biotech . one half roche/ <dig> gs-flx run was performed for each library. from a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads  <dig>  distribute to flag leaves ,  <dig>  to glumes  and  <dig>  to grains . adaptor and quality trimming reduced read-yield to  <dig> , <dig> . average read length was  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp . for each organ, reads were clustered and assembled into contigs and singletons . flag leaves showed highest contig number  but lowest contig length . glumes revealed lowest contig number  and highest contig length . grains showed moderate levels . on average, each contig was covered by  <dig> to  <dig> reads. whereas contig numbers were comparable between the three organs, numbers of singletons vary from high values in fl and g  to low values in gl . this suggests high numbers of lowly expressed genes in flag leaves and grains and low numbers of highly expressed genes in glumes, indicating lower complexity of the glumes transcriptome.

annotation
contigs and singletons obtained after sequence assembly were characterised by a multilevel process of filtering from barley-specific to more general data sets as well as from high to low stringency using the different databases in the following order:  h <dig>  <cit> ,  uniprotkb/swiss-prot  <cit> ,  uniprotkb/trembl  <cit>  and  non-redundant dataset from ncbi  <cit>  with e-value cut-offs of <1e- <dig>  <1e- <dig>  <1e- <dig> and <1e- <dig>  respectively. sequences without a match in one database were compared to the next one. the output of annotation is given in table  <dig> 

percentages of total contig hits are comparable between glumes and grains  but are higher for flag leaves . blast searches against the different databases revealed  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of new contig sequences as not functionally described in h <dig>  for the total no hit category, results for flag leaves are different from those of glumes and grains . percentages of total-hit singletons are comparable for flag leaves and grains  but higher for glumes . this result coincides with the observed low number of glumes singletons  and indicates lower complexity of the glumes transcriptome compared to flag leaves and grains.

the sum of contigs and singletons annotated from flag leaves  yields  <dig>  expressed genes, which is clearly higher than the number of unigenes from h <dig> . this may reflect high redundancy of the flag leaf dataset, which is also obvious for grains  but not for glumes . this can be explained by the fact that only rna-seq reads were used for the assembly process. obviously, some of the rna-seq singletons and/or contigs represent the same gene, but do not overlap and thus increase the numbers within the total hit category. the contribution of contigs should be lower than that of singletons.

tissue-specificity of contigs
for an overview on the tissue specificity of molecular functions, pyrosequence contigs and h <dig> unigenes were annotated based on gene ontology terms  <cit>  and analysed by blast2go software  <cit> . the results from level  <dig> of the category molecular function are depicted in figure  <dig> 

there are two main findings:  flag leaf and grain transcriptomes are highly similar in all depicted categories and  the glumes transcriptome differs from flag leaves and grains, but is comparable to h <dig>  categories “trans-membrane transporter activity”, “substrate-specific transport activity” and to lesser extent “transferase-activity” and “nucleotide binding” are enriched in glumes. especially for “ion binding”, “nucleic acid binding”, “lyase and ligase activities”, “oxidoreductase activity” and “cofactor binding”, the glumes transcriptome is more similar to that of h <dig> than to those of flag leaves and grains.

rna-seq gained new sequence information for n transporters and cysteine peptidases
based on annotation, sequences encoding putative n transporters and cysteine peptidases were selected from h <dig> unigenes and independent blast searches were performed within rna-seq contigs. combining h <dig> and rna-seq information, new sets of n transporter and cysteine peptidase unigenes were created and manually revised for each tissue .

to evaluate the power of the rna-seq approach for n transporter and cysteine peptidase gene families, the contigs were compared with h <dig> . after combining information from all three organs, between 67%  to 100%  of pyrosequencing contigs extend known or add new sequence information in comparison to h <dig> 

results from assembling all candidate sequences from the three libraries and h <dig> are summarised in figure 5a and show a clearly increased average contig length , whereas for total contig number no general tendency was found . in the subset of contigs containing information from both sources  the contig number is reduced for all gene groups and the increase in average contig length is more pronounced than for the overall dataset.

rna-seq contigs of n transporters and cysteine peptidases cluster with annotated homologs from arabidopsis and rice and enlarge available full-length sequences
papain-like cysteine peptidases
for all further analyses, sequences derived from the combination of pyrosequencing and h <dig> as well as unique pyrosequences were considered.

 <dig> genes encoding putative papain-like cysteine peptidases of the ca clan were assembled . based on sequence similarities, the resulting contigs were subdivided into different families of the ca clan . in general, numbers of barley unigenes defined after sequence assembly were lower than numbers of full-length genes in arabidopsis and rice except for the families c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  the c <dig> cysteine peptidase of arabidopsis and rice is encoded by a single copy gene. in contrast, two full-length genes and one additional contig were identified for barley, reflecting at least three gene family members. despite the unclear situation for c <dig>  this subfamily might harbour promising candidates for further investigation, as the high contig number suggests implication for this type of cysteine peptidases in remobilisation processes taking place in at least one analysed tissue.

* full-length barley sequences are given in brackets .

n transporters
the new dataset was aligned with all n transporter amino acid sequences of rice and arabidopsis derived from aramemnon  <cit>  and phylogenetic trees were constructed.

all putative members of the aat family from barley cluster into the subgroups described for a. thaliana by rentsch et al.  <cit> . we furthermore included the group of transporters related to ectyrp, a tyrosine-specific permease of e. col.  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree of aat sequences  contains  <dig> functionally characterised transporters .  <dig> of them reside in the atf clade and seven are apc transporters. most genes with proven functionality  are from arabidopsis, only three from rice, and four from barley. these transporters are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig> and include two barley transporters  that were characterised in the author’s lab.

from  <dig> rna-seq contigs of the barley nrt1/ptr family only  <dig> cluster into the four subfamilies defined by tsay et al.  <cit> , while  <dig> sequences form a separate branch . as blast analysis showed no obvious differences between these  <dig> and the other  <dig> candidates in sequence similarity to the clustering rice sequences , a unique group in barley seems unlikely and these sequences were omitted from the tree. this deviant behaviour might be explained by the overall heterogeneity within this group or the limited sequence information of these outliers .

according to tsay et al.  <cit>  the subgroups are named nrt1/ptr-i, ii, iii and iv  although our data would suggest an adjustment of this classification, as the members of the nrt1/ptr-i group are not monophyletic. the high heterogeneity within subgroup i is also reflected by the sequence distance matrix data  showing similarities of  <dig> % for subgroup i in comparison to  <dig> % and  <dig> % for subgroup ii and iii, respectively. although percentages of similarity are even lower for subgroup iv , this branch is monophyletic confirming the basic structure presented by tsay et al.  <cit> .  <dig> of the presented nrt1/ptr sequences are functionally characterised ,  <dig> of them are coming from arabidopsis, eleven from rice. from barley, only hvptr <dig> belonging to subgroup ii is functionally characterised so far  <cit> .

all  <dig> barley sequences functionally annotated as putative opt transporters cluster into the phylogenetic tree presented in figure  <dig>  phylogenetic analysis clearly separates sequences of the opt type from yellow stripe-like  transporters. also the classification within the ysls according to zheng et al.  <cit>  was reproduced. transporters of the ysl groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show a high degree of sequence similarity whereas the ysl- <dig> group is more diverse  and not monophyletic . furthermore, this group is rice specific with only osysl <dig> functionally characterised  <cit> . ngs transcriptome data from the rice genome annotation project  <cit>  point to pollen-specificity of this ysl-transporter group. sequences of putative hvysl-transporters belonging to subgroups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> might be starting points to analyse micronutrient transport into developing barley grains. the highest number of functionally characterised opts resides within the opt and the ysl- <dig> groups  while no ysl- <dig> transporter is functionally characterised so far.

additional contribution from sequence analysis of barley full-length cdnas
the h <dig> and pyrosequencing output was compared with  <dig>  barley full-length cdnas  <cit> . combining information from these datasets reduced the number of rna-seq unigenes for all three n transporter classes and cpep genes , but also revealed redundancy within the full-length cdna approach. thus, a fraction of these sequences are redundant, at least with regard to n transporters and cpep genes.

*matsumoto et al.  <cit> ; numbers of unigenes shown.

both approaches identified additional and so far unknown sequences. matsumoto et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> novel putative n transporter and cpep genes,  <dig> novel genes were detected by pyrosequencing. in summary, sequence information of expressed barley n transporters and cysteine peptidases comprises  <dig> aat,  <dig> nrt1/ptr,  <dig> opt and  <dig> cpep unigenes . all rna-seq unigenes can be considered as expressed in flag leaves, glumes or grains and are barley-specific as checked against the barley genome sequence  <cit> .

expression profiling of aat genes revealed coordinate distinct developmental stages in flag leaves, glumes and grains
rna-seq and h <dig> sequences were assembled into  <dig> aat,  <dig> nrt1/ptr and  <dig> opt unigenes  and, except  <dig> nrt1/ptr sequences, they cluster into defined subgroups in the respective phylogenetic trees . this unigene set represents  <dig> aat,  <dig> nrt1/ptr and  <dig> opt full-length sequences and shows a considerably higher percentage of full-length aat genes compared to putative nrt1/ptr and opt genes . to exclude a predominant bias of h <dig> leading to these numbers, we compared rna-seq read numbers contributing to aat, nrt1/ptr and opt contigs. table  <dig> shows the number of aat, nrt1/ptr and opt reads representing a ratio of 3:2: <dig>  after normalising read numbers against the average length of annotated rice n transporters a ratio of  <dig> : <dig> : <dig>  is obtained . so both, the raw and normalised read numbers point to higher transcriptional activity of aat genes in comparison to that of the nrt1/ptr and opt group. because of their over-representation in the set of rna-seq n transporter sequences we suggested that this group of n transporters might play an important role in n retranslocation and grain filling. because remobilisation related to increasing grain sink strength might be reflected by changing transcript levels of associated n transporters we decided to compare expression of the full-length aat genes in the three organs.

qrt-pcr analysis was used to estimate transcript amounts in two-day intervals starting  <dig> days before anthesis in vegetative tissues and at anthesis in grains until  <dig> daf, when grain desiccation starts . among the group of  <dig> aat genes showing highest expression in each of the three organs, aaps are clearly overrepresented . besides, lht transporters seem to be important for remobilisation. hvlht <dig> and hvlht <dig> are highly expressed in flag leaves and glumes, respectively. in developing grains their expression is either very low or not detectable. there, specific members of the ant group are highly expressed, hvant <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig> daf and hvant <dig> during early as well as late grain development .

*for each tissue the six aat genes showing highest expression levels are presented.

to visualise relationships between the three tissues, principle component analysis  was applied to the tissue-specific qrt-pcr results. then, k-means clustering was used to identify developmental stages that might be related to each other. the results of the two-step procedure are depicted in the lower panels of figure  <dig>  in each panel, coloured areas represent related stages. for all three organs, a group including stages  <dig> and  <dig> daf was identified . besides, developmental stages representing the late phase of grain development form separate groups . k-means clusters coloured in green represent stages of early development. they are highly dispersed, especially between flag leaves and glumes .

discussion
the majority of n accumulating in cereal grains originates from proteins remobilised from vegetative organs, but interactions of grain filling and remobilisation are only poorly understood. here we used large-scale transcriptome pyrosequencing of flag leaves, glumes and developing grains to identify putative cysteine peptidases and transporters of amino acids, peptides and oligopeptides involved in n remobilisation and retranslocation into developing grains. this approach suggests that distinct amino acid transporters might be important in sink-source communication between remobilising organs and accumulating grains.

rna-seq revealed the specific character of the glumes transcriptome
the read numbers gained by transcriptome sequencing are similar with about  <dig>  million for each organ with higher values for flag leaves . also average length and number of reads per contig are comparable between the three organs. in glumes lower contig numbers but higher read numbers per contig were found and furthermore the number of singletons in the glume transcriptome is only one third compared to flag leaves and grains. this suggests either higher specificity or lower complexity of the glumes transcriptome.

comparison of the three transcript sets as visualised in figure  <dig> revealed high similarity between flag leaf and grain contigs . on the other hand, only about 5% of glumes sequences are identical with those in flag leaves or grains, pointing again to either higher specificity or lower complexity of the glumes transcriptome.

another argument underlining the specific character of the glumes transcriptome comes from annotation of organ-specific rna-seq contigs and its comparison to h <dig> based on gene ontology terms . these results suggest a different function of the glumes transcriptome compared to the two other tissues especially regarding transport activity. potential functions of the glumes transcriptome are more similar to these of h <dig> than to those of flag leaves and grains. h <dig> contigs consist of ests derived from several different tissues. thus, functional annotation of the glumes transcriptome points to expression patterns representing an average of many tissues. this indicates that annotated functions in glumes are less tissue-specific, whereas transcriptomes of flag leaves and grains seem to be tissue-specific and functional annotation indicates similarity between the two organs.

in summary, comparisons between the transcriptomes of flag leaves, glumes and grains indicates that gene expression in glumes is less tissue-specific and might be characterised by higher activity of a lower number of genes. the glumes transcriptome seems to be different from those of flag leaves and grains whereas the latter two organs reveal functional similarity to each other.

glumes might function as mediator between remobilising vegetative tissues and accumulating grains
relative to grains, both flag leaves and glumes are source organs. nitrogen mobilisation during grain filling and the role of flag leaves and glumes have been studied predominantly in wheat  <cit> . these studies revealed different cellular organisation and distribution of glumes compared to leaves of the same developmental stage  <cit> . glumes have more sclerenchyma cells, which serve as a supporting structure for the grain. compared to flag leaves, glumes contain less green tissue and, consequently, fewer chloroplasts and less rubisco  <cit> .

during grain development, a decline in the content of soluble proteins is detected in both flag leaves and glumes but patterns of remobilisation differ. protein content in flag leaves remains constant up to anthesis and declines when grains develop. glumes continue to accumulate protein until  <dig> daf before remobilisation starts. the different initiation time of remobilisation suggests that glumes act as a transient sink for n derived from flag leaves and senescing vegetative organs. these studies indicate that glumes are supplying nitrogen to the grains during later developmental stages  <cit> .

glumes contain high percentages of gln, pro, lys, arg and his  <cit> . considerable high contents of gln, lys, arg and his also occur in the nucellar projection  compared to endosperm transfer cells  at the beginning of grain filling  <cit> . the np/etc complex represents the transfer path between maternal and filial grain tissues and also functions as a metabolic interface to precondition amino acid supply to the developing endosperm. in np cells, gene expression of different cytosolic isoforms of gln synthetase  could be involved in re-assimilation of ammonia from protein breakdown and production of n transport compounds  <cit> . such a function has been suggested also for gs present in glumes  <cit> .

in summary, flag leaves and glumes obviously function differently, at least during early grain development when sink strength of the endosperm is still low. analogies can be observed between glumes and supplying maternal grain tissues. this suggests that the glumes metabolism is adjusted to the changing demands of developing grains and points to a putative function of the glumes as mediator between  vegetative tissues and  grains.

rna-seq identified a set of putative cysteine peptidase and n transporter genes possibly involved in remobilising and accumulating of nitrogen
rna-seq provided new sequence information for cysteine peptidases and n transporter genes compared to h <dig> , reduced redundancy and increased unigene length within h <dig> data . with respect to full-length cdnas published by matsumoto et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> contigs were identified as unique in the collection of pyrosequences . while these new sequences might be involved in degradation and retranslocation of n compounds during grain development those cdnas present only in the h <dig> or matsumoto collections should be less relevant for such functions.

cysteine peptidases
papain-like cysteine peptidases play an important role in naturally senescing barley tissues  <cit> , especially between  <dig> and  <dig> days post anthesis  <cit> . although several genes encoding cysteine proteases are upregulated during senescence  <cit> , direct evidence for the implication of specific members from this class of proteases in protein degradation is lacking.

combination of h <dig> and rna-seq sequence information identified a set of  <dig> unigenes that encode papain-like cysteine peptidases . this set represents  <dig> full-length sequences and  <dig> unigenes that belong to an unknown number of genes. some of these sequences might belong to the same gene but cannot be aligned . these candidates can be considered as active between anthesis and daf  <dig> in at least one of the three tissues. in comparison, the total number of cysteine peptidase genes from the same peptidase family of rice and arabidopsis is high  pointing to a certain degree of specificity of the newly assembled contigs for remobilisation. in the c <dig> and c <dig> families most unigenes , as well as most new full-length sequences  were found , predestining their members as promising candidates. analysis of tissue-specificity and localisation of the respective gene products to defined cellular compartments remain to be done.

amino acid permeases seem to be predominant in n retranslocation and grain filling
aaps seem to be predominant in n retranslocation and grain filling. this conclusion was derived from over-representation of this gene family in the set of rna-seq derived n transporter sequences  and from its very strong expression in both, source and sink tissues . two of the highly expressed putative aap genes  are active only in the source tissues flag leaves and glumes, two others  are expressed in source as well as sink tissues. among the putative transporter genes listed in table  <dig>  hvaap <dig> is specific for grains. hvaap <dig> but also hvaap <dig> show high sequence similarity to ataap <dig> and ataap <dig> . the two arabidopsis transporters play a role in supplying developing seeds with nitrogen  <cit> . hvaap <dig> and hvaap <dig> are closely related to ataap <dig> and ataap <dig> . ataap <dig> is expressed in mature leaves, stems and flowers and involved in long-distance transfer of amino acids, especially glutamine, the predominant amino acid found in the phloem  <cit> . promoter-reporter gene fusions showed that ataap <dig> is expressed in vascular tissues of stems and siliques. furthermore, ataap <dig> expression is tightly associated with phloem strands that connect to fruits. thus, ataap <dig> seems to be an excellent candidate for xylem-phloem transfer along this path  <cit> , a role that might also be assumed for hvaap <dig> and hvaap <dig>  hvaap <dig> is a member of a separated branch of the aat tree harbouring only uncharacterised rice and barley sequences . because of its high expression in flag leaves and glumes during grain filling, hvaap <dig> can be considered as being an interesting candidate for functional studies in barley.

besides members of the aap family, the two putative transporters hvlht <dig> and hvlht <dig> seem to be specifically important for n retranslocation in flag leaves  and glumes . at the sequence level, the two proteins are closely related to each other and to the functionally characterised osht <dig>  <cit> . because of its high expression and strong tissues-specificity , hvlht <dig> might be an excellent candidate to elucidate the specific role of glumes for n supply to the developing grains. two members of the ant gene family  are highly expressed in developing grains . because only one member of the large ant family is functionally characterised so far , any hint to possible functions of hvant <dig> and hvant <dig> in grain filling is missing.

a putative role for amino acid transporters in sink-source communication
seed sink strength for n, which means the ability of the grain to attract and import n compounds, is due to high storage protein synthesis and high demand and/or intensity of active uptake via membrane-localised transporters  <cit> . recent work in our lab demonstrated that increasing sink strength due to overexpression of an amino acid transporter in legume seeds increases amino acid supply, total seed n and protein content  <cit> .

in barley grains, highest expression of storage protein genes occurs between  <dig> and  <dig> daf  <cit> . storage protein accumulation starts two days later in aleurone and starchy endosperm cells  <cit> . simultaneously, when high n sink strength is initiated a set of aat genes is transcriptionally activated in grains . remarkably, expression of these genes is low between  <dig> and  <dig> daf, but higher during early development. pca and k-means clustering of aat gene expression data, clearly separate three groups of data points belonging to stages  <dig> and  <dig> daf,  <dig> to  <dig> daf and  <dig> to  <dig> daf . these groups have been assigned to pre-storage, intermediate  and storage phases of barley grain development, respectively. this staging of grain development has been deduced from transcript profiling of  <dig>  grain-expressed unigenes. data evaluation justified the intermediate phase between  <dig> and  <dig> daf  <cit> . considering expression profiles of aat genes alone, the intermediate phase would start two days later and would be prolonged to  <dig> daf . this reflects the interval between beginning starch accumulation in the differentiated caryopsis centre  and high storage protein synthesis in the peripheral parts of the grain. such difference in the beginning of the transition phase reflects delayed beginning of protein accumulation compared to starch biosynthesis, and also reveals the internal gradient of caryopsis differentiation.

the highly expressed members of the aat gene family in flag leaves and glumes differ from those in filling grains , but phases of grain development are also reflected in the supplying organs flag leaves and glumes . in grains and glumes, transition phase and grain filling include the same stages . this supports the hypothesis that glumes adjust metabolism according to the specific demands of the grains. remarkably, expression of aat genes in flag leaves is elevated four days earlier than in glumes and grains . thus, flag leaves seem to respond to the expected demand for amino acids before sink strength is established in grains and respectively, the transition phase starts two days earlier. striking differences are visible between flag leaves and glumes during pre-anthesis and early grain development . this strengthens the assumption that glumes function in a distinctive way compared to flag leaves, at least during early grain development.

increasing n demand can generate long-distance signals within the plant  <cit> . possibly certain n compounds or amino acids could be translocated through the phloem and its fluctuating levels might signal the nitrogen status of the plant. especially glutamate has been suggested to function as an evolutionary conserved long-distance signal in plants as well as in animals  <cit> . cytokinins can also be involved in signalling the n status of the plant  <cit> . the phloem might be important in delivering signals to distantly located plant organs. in this way, high grain demands for n might decrease assimilate levels in the phloem which could generate signals for remobilisation in the source.

we hypothesise that in such a way phases of grain developmen could be perceived in the ear-near tissues flag leaf and glumes. this would suggest development-specific signalling which mediates sink-source communication during grain development and which also might regulate aat gene expression. tissue-specific regulation of sink/source transition can also play a role as observed from fluctuating transcript abundances of aat genes especially in flag leaves. overall, such hypothetical relationship in sink-source communication has been derived from expression profiles of a collection of genes which transcripts are over-represented in a specific set of pyrosequences which demonstrates the power of this approach.

CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the overall dataset showed, that flag leaves and glumes obviously have different functions during early grain development when endosperm sink strength is low. analogies in gene expression observed between glumes and the supplying maternal tissues indicate that glumes function as mediators between remobilising vegetative tissues and accumulating grains. combination of already known and newly derived sequence information reduced redundancy, increased contig length and identified new members of cysteine peptidase and n transporter gene families. participation of the respective gene products in either n remobilisation or accumulation can be expected. amino acid permeases , a sub-group of the aat family of n transporters seem to be predominant in n retranslocation and grain filling. in phylogenetic trees, putative hvaap genes which are highly expressed in remobilising tissues cluster together with functionally characterised arabidopsis transporters responsible for long-distance transport of amino acids. in contrast, grain-specific aaps are most similar to arabidopsis transporters active in developing embryos. based on expression profiling of aat genes and subsequent statistical data analysis we hypothesise that high grain demands for n might decrease assimilate levels in the phloem which could generate signals for remobilisation in the source. our future scientific work will be focussed on identification of metabolic/hormonal phloem components, which signal the grain n status to the plant.

overall, cysteine peptidase and n transporter sequences as identified in this study might be of high interest for applied research because of their obvious role in n partitioning for grain filling. up to now, information is based only on transcript data. for application of this knowledge in development of new breeding strategies, the specific role of individual candidates  in n remobilisation and accumulation has to be clarified.
