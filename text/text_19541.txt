BACKGROUND
pcd has a major role in mediating plant adaptive responses to harsh conditions. hypersensitive response  represents the most common type of pcd in plants basically as a result of pathogen attack  <cit> . several reports indicated that pcd also occurs in response to various abiotic stresses including salinity . salt stress was reported to elevate reactive oxygen species  levels, thus, can induce pcd  <cit> . hence, we hypothesized that retardation of pcd machinery might result in delayed response to salt stress in plant. salt-induced pcd is affected by ion disequilibrium resulted during na+/k+ exchange  <cit> . the latter process results in the induction of hydroxyl radicals that regulate several pcd-related proteins, ex., bcl- <dig>  this protein is antiapoptotic and represses the vacuolar processing enzymes , by modulating ion fluxes. bcl- <dig> encoding gene also reduces k+ efflux under salt stress, hence, retards pcd  <cit> . the protein also interacts with bax <dig>  protein to block its action in inducing pcd  <cit> . in addition, zhang et al.  <cit>  indicated that expression of genes encoding the two cysteine protease inhibitors, e.g., atcysa and atcysb, improves salt tolerance in arabidopsis.

a conserved tf superfamily, namely apetala2/ethylene responsive factor , has a special attraction in the plant kingdom as its members are involved in vital biological processes during growth and development and in the response to several biotic and abiotic stimuli. therefore, tfs of this family were valuable targets for genetic transformation and plant breeding programs. however, the response to the growth regulator ethylene is not a universal feature of this superfamily  <cit> . the family is subdivided in arabidopsis thaliana according to the similarity of its ap2/erf binding domain into two main groups, the dehydration-responsive element binding-proteins  and the erfs. little information is available for the dna binding properties of ap <dig> proteins, although they are known to interact with flowering-regulatory genes  <cit> . several dreb members bind to an a/gccgac element existing upstream of genes responding to aba, drought and cold  <cit> . erf members bind specifically to another element, e.g., agccgcc or gcc-box upstream of genes responding to ethylene, pathogens and wounding  <cit> . dna-binding affinities of members of this family are highly diversified to accommodate the plethora of responses to external stimuli . very little so far is known for the participation of erf in pcd as only one member of this large gene family in nicotiana umbratica, namely macd <dig>  was proven to positively regulate factors affecting pcd triggered by phytotoxin aal  <cit> . the authors also triggered pcd in arabidopsis using a structural analog of aal, namely fumonisin b <dig> , and proved that another member, namely erf <dig>  participates in pcd. overall, ap2/erf superfamily genes were characterized in plant and proven to respond to cold, salt and drought stresses, and recommended in brassica to be utilized via transgenic technology to improve tolerance to such adverse conditions  <cit> .

the present study was based on the hypothesis that tfs  and their driven genes likely co-express under different stimuli. pcd-related genes were used as landmarks to detect co-expressed tfs that might regulate their expression in tobacco , hence, detect influence of their analogs in arabidopsis under salt stress. the overall data indicated the involvement of a tf of erf family, namely erf <dig>  in cell death and salt tolerance.

methods
materials
wild-type  tobacco  plants  were grown from seed in a growth room 22/20 °c ± 2 °c day/night temperatures with 16-h photoperiod. agrobacterium tumefaciens and escherichia coli strains were grown in lb medium at  <dig> and 37 °c, respectively. ampicillin was used at 100 μg/ml, while at  <dig> and 100 μg/ml for kanamycin and rifampicin, respectively. arabidopsis wt  as well as the t-dna insertion  and over-expression  lines of the two tfs, e.g., erf <dig> and tfiid <dig>  respectively, were provided by the salk institute, genomic analysis laboratory . the lines were grown in appropriate selective medium and screened for homozygosity by pcr. sequences of primers and pcr conditions are available in arabidopsis database .

rna-seq analysis
rna-seq was done and analyzed for rnas extracted from leaf discs of 7-week-old tobacco  wt plants treated with oxalic acid  at 20 mm for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h to induce pcd as indicated earlier  <cit> . rna samples were deep sequenced at bgi, china, which generated over  <dig> million reads per sample. raw reads were filtered and aligned  to the n. benthamiana draft genome . rsem v <dig> . <dig> was used to estimate the relative abundances read counts and utilized bowtie aligner  to map the reads against assembled transcripts. expected read counts were used as resources to differential expression analysis by edger . the unmapped sequences were re-aligned against the contigs collectively de novo assembled using the trinity rna-seq assembly package . blastx was performed against the ncbi non-redundant protein database with an e-value cut off of 1e- <dig> in order to detect proteins with tf-related domain. fold change  values of de transcripts were calculated against the published tobacco actin  as the house-keeping gene and fc of ≥  <dig> was selected for further analysis. then, significant pearson correlation through permutation analysis was determined. the resulting clusters were refined visually and analyzed for go terms using blast2go . to validate rna-seq data, semi-quantitative  rt-pcr of selected tfs was done .

construction of virus induced gene silencing  lines and pcd assays
vigs lines of selected tfs were generated in 4-week-old tobacco  seedlings as previously described  <cit> . selection was based on the expression patterns and the co-expression data of tfs with pcd-related genes used as landmarks. primers used in constructing the gateway compatible ptrv <dig> vectors  <cit>  of different genes were synthesized. empty ptrv vectors were provided by professor gregory martin, cornell university, usa). then, spreading of the trv virus in the newly emerged leaves was detected visually via the use of ptrv2-gfp construct  <cit>  in transforming tobacco. visualization of gfp in the transgenic plant was done by illumination with longwave  ultraviolet lamp. efficiency of vigs was detected via the use of trv2-pds  <cit> . the construct was used to knockdown pds  gene towards the generation of photo-bleaching in the newly developed leaves.

leaf discs of wt and vigs lines of tobacco  plants were obtained from 7-week-old plants using a 10-mm-diameter cork borer and discs were submerged in oa  at 20 mm for 24 h. then, scoring of cell death in vigs of different lines was done quantitatively by evans blue assay  <cit>  and qualitatively by dna laddering  <cit> . expression of three selected tfs in tobacco vigs lines was validated via qrt-pcr with wt and vigs line with empty ptrv <dig> used as controls. for each sample, 2 μg of total rna was used to synthesize first-strand cdna with oligo using revert aid premium reverse transcriptase . qrt-pcr was performed with gene-specific primers to amplify 190–199 bp . templates were normalized to amplify 196 bp fragment of the tobacco actin or nbactin, used as the reference gene. qrt-pcr was done in a total of 25-μl volume containing 1 μl cdna,  <dig>  μl  <dig> x bio-rad iqtmsybr@greensupermix,  <dig>  μl rox reference dye , 1 μl  <dig> nm of each primer. all reactions were performed in triplets and run on a mx3005p qpcr system  using the following conditions: 5 min at 95 °c, 40 cycles of 30s at 95 °c, 60s at 55–56 °c, 20s at 72 °c and 72 °c . pcr products were examined by melt curve analysis. amplicons generated from nbactin gene reached saturation at cycles between  <dig> and  <dig>  expression levels of tf genes relative to nbactin gene were calculated using mxpro qpcr software v <dig>  package, which compares reaction takeoff points . relative mrna abundance was estimated as previously described  <cit> . knockdown of the other tfs in tobacco vigs lines as well as knockout and over-expression of selected tfs in arabidopsis were also proven via sqrt-pcr. amplification was done with the conditions indicated earlier  <cit> .

salt stress experiment for arabidopsis t-dna insertion knockout and over-expression lines
based on pcd assays results, two salt stress experiments at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 200 mm nacl were conducted to detect the performances of t-dna insertion knockout and over-expression lines of selected tfs as compared to the wt control . salt stress experiments were conducted with growth conditions indicated earlier  <cit> . the first experiment was conducted in order to detect germination percentages of seeds left to germinate on different salt treatments and scores were made at day  <dig>  where no further seed germination can take place. the second experiment was conducted for 2-week-old seedlings left to grow on different salt treatments for two more weeks and measurements were made for root length , number of leaves per plant and the rosette area .

statistical analyses
pcd assay and salt stress experiment were designed in randomized complete blocks with three replicates. statistical analyses of different experiments were performed following the procedure outlined by gomez and gomez  <cit>  and multiple comparisons were performed following duncan’s new multiple range test  <cit> .

RESULTS
transcription factors co-expressed with pcd-related genes
based on our previous investigation  <cit> , pcd-related genes existing in  <dig> clusters  of up-regulation after 2 h exposure to oa were detect, of which  <dig> genes were used as landmarks to detect concordantly expressed tfs. the results indicated that  <dig> tfs were concordantly expressed with the selected pcd-related genes in  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  clusters . these tfs mainly belong to four tf families, namely erf , myb , wrky  and nac . they also include gte <dig>  dof zinc finger, bed zinc, cprf <dig>  bhlh <dig>  tfiid <dig>  crf <dig>  spt <dig> and tga <dig>  tfs detected in the four families were mainly cited to have roles during development or during biotic and/or abiotic stresses.

effects of oa on tobacco plants knocked down in selected tfs via vigs
primers used in constructing ptrv <dig> for generating vigs lines and in detecting levels of gene expression of different vigs lines are shown in additional file 5: table s <dig>  no morphological differences in terms of phenotype or growth performance were detected among the recovered vigs lines, on one hand, or between the vigs lines and wt plants, on the other hand. to morphologically detect the efficiency of vigs and spreading of the virus, pds  gene was knocked down via vigs and gfp gene was expressed in wt tobacco. the results indicated silencing  of the pds gene in its vigs line and expression of gfp gene in the new leaves of transformed plants 21 days after infiltration . bright color refers to transformed cells expressing gfp, while violet color refers to non-transformed cells. the results of qrt-pcr and sqrt-pcr indicated that a number of  <dig>  out of  <dig>  tobacco tfs were successfully knocked down in tobacco vigs lines . levels of expression in replicates of vigs lines generated for each gene are uniform .fig.  <dig> silencing of the pds gene to cause photo-bleaching  and over-expression of gfp  in tobacco  plants to prove the incidence of vigs. photographs were taken 21 days after infiltration. arrows indicate the newly developed leaves with gene knocked down, e.g., pds  or expressed, e.g., gfp  via vigs

cell death after 24 h due to the treatment with oa in tobacco wt leaf discs was proven using evans blue staining and dna laddering . the results of pcd assay either induced or repressed due to the knockdown of tfs in vigs lines are shown in table  <dig>  the results indicated that vigs lines of four tf genes responded differently as compared to the other vigs lines as well as wt and vigs with empty ptrv <dig>  one of them, namely erf <dig> , indicated antiapoptotic effect, where the mean relative cell death value due to oa  treatment was significantly the highest in its knockdown vigs line as compared to the other knockdown lines or controls. the other three genes, namely onac <dig> , wrky <dig>  and tfiid <dig> , indicated apoptotic influence as the mean relative cell death values under treatment were significantly lower in their knocked down vigs lines than the other knockdown lines or controls. the results of qrt-pcr confirmed the occurrence of knockdown in three out of the four tf genes, namely erf <dig>  wrky <dig> and tfiid <dig>  as the predicated amplicon size of onac <dig> is short, hence, no specific reverse primer was possibly generated. the results of sqrt-pcr confirmed the co-expression of three pcd-related genes with their respective tfs . the pcd-related genes co-expressed with erf <dig>  wrky <dig> and tfiid <dig> genes are bax inhibitor  <dig> , apoptosis-inducing factor homolog a-like  and mildew resistance locus o , respectively. sqrt-pcr was also done for the vigs lines of other tfs and confirmed the occurrence of gene silencing  albeit the lack of influence during pcd. silencing was also not tested in vigs lines of gte <dig> , or wrky <dig>  as no specific reverse primers were possibly generated .table  <dig> description of tf transcripts co-expressed with pcd-related genes knocked down via vigs and multiple comparisons of the mean relative cell death as responses of tobacco leaf discs following oa  treatment for 24 h as determined by evans blue staining. dye released from dead cells was measured at absorbance at 600 nm. measurements were expressed as relative values with “one” corresponds to the maximum value and others are relative to it. data are presented as means from two independent experiments with three replicates each. red boxes indicate lower level of cell death in leaf discs, while blue box indicate higher level of cell death upon knock down of transcript as compared to leaf discs of the wild type non-transformed plant  or those of plants transformed with prtv <dig> only

means followed by the same letter are not significantly different by duncan’s new multiple range test 




performance of arabidopsis knockout and over-expression lines under salt stress
analogs of two out of the four tf genes , namely nac <dig> and wrky <dig>  have no seeds available at the time of the experiment in arabidopsis seed stock at the salk institute, genomic analysis laboratory . genes encoding the other two tfs, e.g., erf <dig>  and tfiid <dig>  had seeds available for both t-dna knockout  and over-expression  lines , hence, used in salt stress experiment after expected expression levels were proven . based on pcd assay, the first gene was shown to act as antiapoptotic gene, while the second was shown to act as apoptotic gene. seeds of the two ko and the two oe lines of erf <dig> and tfiid <dig> genes as well as seeds of the wt were left to germinate at different concentrations of nacl  in order to detect the percentages of germination at day  <dig>  <cit> . the results indicated no significant differences among lines up to 150 mm nacl, while significant differences were scored for germination percentage under 200 mm nacl . the highest significant value was scored for erf109-oe line, while the lowest was scored for erf-ko line. oe and ko of tfiid <dig> gene resulted in no significant differences in germination percentages as compared to the wt plant.fig.  <dig> 
a effect of salt stress on germination percentage  of seeds germinated on ms medium supplemented with different concentrations of nacl  for two selected arabidopsis t-dna insertion knockout  mutants and over-expression  lines of genes encoding two tfs, namely erf <dig>  and tfiid <dig> , as compared to the wt control . seeds of the four genotypes were germinated at 0 mm nacl, left for 2 weeks on ms agar plates, then, transferred to the soil for two more weeks with different salt concentrations. growth parameters included root length  , no. leaves per plant  and rosette area  . statistical analysis was performed following the procedure outlined by gomez and gomez  <cit>  and multiple comparisons were performed following duncan’s new multiple range test  <cit> . standard error bars that do not overlap indicate that the difference between two means is statistically significant




in a parallel salt stress experiment, 2-week-old plants of the different genotypes were grown in the soil for two more weeks under different salt treatments. then, plants were characterized for the mean root length , number of leaves/plant and rosette areas  . the results for the three parameters indicated the highest significant values for erf109-oe line starting 150 mm nacl as compared to the wt and the other genotypes, while erf109-ko line showed the lowest. there were no significant differences among tfiid5-oe, tfiid5-ko and wt plants under different salt concentrations for different characteristics except for rosette area, where tfiid5-oe showed significantly higher values as compared to the wt and the two ko mutants.

discussion
ethylene-responsive element-binding factors  is a gene family of transcriptional factors that is involved in the adaptation to biotic or abiotic stresses . one prior incidence indicated the participation of a member of this family in pcd  <cit> . the latter incidence is the only support to our data in confirming the role of an erf gene during pcd. previous reports indicated that erf <dig> gene  responds in arabidopsis to ethylene  and jasmonic acid  in order to regulate redox homeostasis during both biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . over-expression of the gene also conferred the enhanced resistance to oxidative stress  <cit> . other reports support the finding that erf <dig> gene functions in environmental signal transduction  <cit> . the gene also regulates lateral root formation in vascular tissues via mediating cross-talking between ja signaling and auxin biosynthesis, where the tf binds to the promoters of asa <dig> and yuc <dig> genes, which encode two key enzymes in auxin biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . studying erf <dig> ko mutants in arabidopsis suggested that erf <dig> gene has a positive role in salt-induced lateral root development  <cit> . we argue that the changes in root architecture might affect ion disequilibrium and na+/k+ exchange in plants under salt stress, hence, results in the improved tolerance to adverse conditions. the results shown in additional file 9: figure s <dig> also indicates the involvement of erf <dig> gene in the expression of bax inhibitor- <dig>  gene. the latter gene inhibits apoptosis induced by bax and enables the cell to adapt to salt stress by controlling stress-induced reactive oxygen species  production  <cit> . thus, erf <dig> gene might have an additional indirect role in retarding pcd and conferring tolerance against abiotic stresses by regulating the expression of bi- <dig> gene.

the results of sqrt-pcr for the ko line of this gene in our study indicated no expression of erf <dig> gene. the gene was reported to have a unique role and share no functions with other erf family members  <cit> . the gene was also known to be barely expressed in plant under normal condition in agreement with our results. more recent analysis of this gene in aquilaria sinensis calli indicated that the gene was 4-fold expressed after 24 h of salt stress  as compared to its expression level in the normal condition  <cit> . however, the gene was not previously studied at earlier time points  in order to detect the time where the gene reached the highest level of expression. up-regulation of the genes encoding tfs likely occurs upstream the genes they regulate, hence, expression of erf <dig> gene likely takes place soon after treatment. this speculation is supported in the present study by rna-seq data of tobacco, where the gene was highly expressed after 2 h of oa treatment.

it was previously reported that erf <dig> gene is involved in a number of biological processes  <cit> , of which pcd can now be added. our results of erf <dig> gene in arabidopsis under salt stress are in complete harmony with those in tobacco under pcd. therefore, our hypothesis, that knocking down or knocking out tf that regulate an apoptotic gene might allow the plant to survive longer under adverse conditions, can apply to erf <dig> gene. in other words, we argue that erf <dig> gene has a duel effect under both pcd and salt stress.

CONCLUSIONS
the present work aimed at detecting the role of transcription factors  concordantly expressed with genes related to programmed cell death  in conferring salt stress tolerance in plant. rna-seq analysis was performed for tobacco  leaves exposed to oxalic acid  to induce pcd. pcd-related genes up-regulated after 2 h of treatment were utilized as landmarks to select tfs with concordant expression. knockdown mutants via virus induced gene silencing  of these tfs were generated in tobacco to detect influence during pcd. knockout insertion mutants of arabidopsis as well as over-expression lines of one tf, namely erf <dig>  analogs to those in tobacco, indicated its involvement in conferring salt stress tolerance in arabidopsis.
