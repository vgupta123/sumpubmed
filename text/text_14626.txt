BACKGROUND
watermelon  is an important specialty crop accounting for approximately 7% of the world agricultural area devoted to vegetable crops. china is the largest producer and consumer, with an annual production of about  <dig> million tons . the long term cultivation and selection of watermelon for desirable horticultural qualities resulted in modern watermelon cultivars with a narrow genetic base and susceptibility to a large number of diseases and pests  <cit> . watermelon includes three subspecies: c. lanatus subsp. lanatus l., which represents a group of ancient cultigens, the ‘tsamma’ or ‘citron’ watermelon, that naturally thrives in southern africa; c. lanatus subsp. mucosospermus l., which represents the egusi watermelon group that has large edible seeds with a fleshy pericarp  <cit> ; and c. lanatus subsp. vulgaris l., which represents the sweet  watermelon group that gave rise to the modern cultivated elite watermelon  <cit> . the citron and egusi types are sources of resistance to economically important diseases, such as fusarium wilt races  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit>  and zucchini yellow mosaic virus   <cit> . however, several critical steps that include accurate phenotyping for disease or pest resistance, high density genetic mapping and genome sequencing and assembly studies are needed as part of continuous efforts to utilize citron and egusi type germplasm for the improvement of elite watermelon cultivars. the construction of highly saturated maps is often a time-consuming process, especially if investigators are employing different parental material and markers are not easily transferable. merged maps are attractive since their integration allows for increased marker density. a number of integrated linkage maps have been developed in economically important crops to increase marker density and integrate the qtl information, including melon   <cit> , grapevine   <cit> , lettuce   <cit> , maize   <cit> , sorghum   <cit> , red clover   <cit> , ryegrass   <cit>  and wheat   <cit> .

watermelon has a genome size of 425 mb . several genetic linkage maps have been constructed for the crop however these maps often have a much higher number of linkage groups than the expected  <dig>  with uneven marker distribution. these low density maps were mainly based on isozymes  <cit> , rapd , rflp , aflp  and srap  markers, and only a limited number of ssr  markers  <cit> . more recently, a high density linkage map with  <dig> loci was constructed using simple sequence repeat , insertion-deletion  and structure variation  markers  <cit>  by the national engineering research center for vegetables, and the first single-nucleotide polymorphism  genetic maps were constructed through a collaboration between the university of georgia  and monsanto , resulting in  <dig> public snp markers  <cit> . quantitative trait loci  associated with economically important seed and fruit traits in watermelon were also mapped in the three individual populations used to create the snp maps  <cit> . together, these maps represent all three subspecies of c. lanatus, however the maps produced by the two research groups don’t include any common markers and possess large numbers of individual-specific markers. this complicates comparisons of colinearity, segregation distortion and qtl locations across the three c. lanatus subspecies. the snp maps also have more than  <dig> linkage groups and some large gaps . the construction of an integrated map provides the opportunity to merge the snp maps used to map horticulturally important traits and the 97103 × pi 296341-fr ril map used to anchor the watermelon genome. the integration of the four maps representing the three subspecies will make it possible to compare and confirm marker order  <cit>  and qtl information. the integrated map also provides more choice in the type of marker and increases the probability of polymorphic markers in important chromosomal intervals and greater genome coverage than single crosses.

here, we report the colinearity among four genetically diverse watermelon maps and the construction of an integrated linkage map of watermelon. we also report new qtl identified for fruit sugar traits and the location of previously reported qtl  <cit>  on the integrated map. this made it possible to compare the genomic location of the qtl mapped in the different populations and suggest a common nomenclature to name these qtl.

RESULTS
construction of the integrated map
in order to make map integration possible, the  <dig> snp markers described by sandlin et al.  <cit>  were genotyped in the 97103 × pi 296341-fr ril population  <cit>  by mining genotyping by sequencing  data for the population. a total of  <dig> snp loci were segregating in the latter population, allowing the integration of  <dig> data points generated from four mapping populations representing eight watermelon parental accessions . the largest data sets were from the parental accession 97103 × pi 296341-fr ril population. based on the high density saturated genetic map  <cit>  and snp map  <cit> , we integrated  <dig> ssr,  <dig> indel,  <dig> sv and  <dig> snp markers to construct the integrated map. the integrated map contains  <dig> markers, spanning 798 cm with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm . the size of the watermelon genome is  <dig> mbp  <cit>  and the map defined herein represents average physical intervals of  <dig> kb per marker, making it the most saturated map of watermelon to date. the previous consensus map by sandlin et al.  <cit>  for the three snp maps contained  <dig> markers with a total length of 1753 cm and an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. the sandlin et al.  <cit>  map was also based on comparisons of marker order and distances, rather than recombination frequencies.

ssr: simple sequence repeat, indel: insertion-deletion, snp: single-nucleotide polymorphism, sv: structure variation.

the largest number of markers  was placed on chromosome  <dig> which also had the longest genetic distance of  <dig>  cm, while chromosome  <dig> only has  <dig> markers spanning  <dig>  cm, making it the smallest and shortest chromosome. the marker information for the mapped ssr, indel, sv, snp markers and corresponding scaffolds, as well as the physical location of the markers on the draft genome sequence are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

colinearity among individual maps, integrated map and physical map
a total of  <dig> snp markers were mapped in the 97103× pi 296341-fr population. because there were only  <dig> common snp markers among the four mapping populations, we chose individual snp maps to do colinearity comparison with the integrated map. there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> common markers with the integrated map respectively in kbs × nhm, sii × egusi, and zwrm50 × citron map. there was a high degree of marker colinearity between the four individual maps for all the markers in common with the integrated map . the same colinearity was observed between the integrated genetic map  and physical map  . only in the region  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm of chromosome  <dig> was there an obvious reverse of the marker order between the 97103× pi 296341-fr map and the three individual sandlin et al.  <cit>  maps. however, since this region on chromosome  <dig> has a high degree of marker colinearity in the three individual snp maps, this reverse may due to the difference in calculating methods during the genetic mapping process. the lack of differences in locus order suggests that major chromosomal rearrangements have not occurred during the recent evolutionary history  of watermelon species.

marker segregation distortion analysis among individual maps
segregation distortion is prevalent in wide-cross populations, and plays an important role in plant genome evolution  <cit> . nine significant segregation distortion regions  were detected in the elite cultivar × wild citron  ril population  <cit> . the marker alleles from the cultivar parent  were favored in the sdr on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> while the citron  alleles were favored in the sdr on chromosome  <dig> . in the zwrm <dig>  × pi  <dig>  f <dig> population, five sdrs  were detected . although both populations had sdrs on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  they were in different regions of the chromosomes. the markers on chromosome  <dig> are skewed towards the citron parent  in both populations, while markers on chromosome  <dig> are skewed towards the cultivar parent  in both populations. however, markers on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> skewed toward different type parents in the two populations. no sdrs were detected in the crosses between two elite cultivars, klondike black seeded × new hampshire midget , and an elite cultivar and wild egusi accession, strain ii × pi  <dig> .

the use of inter-specific hybrids to construct genetic maps is a common strategy to ensure the availability of a high number of polymorphic markers, and in such cases segregation distortion may be common  <cit> . depending on the relative frequency and intensity of the segregation distortion, it may not interfere in the map construction. nevertheless, such distortion, especially in the regions skewed toward the wild genotypes on chromosome  <dig>  may hinder the transfer of economically important alleles during watermelon breeding. the relatively high number of genomic regions with skewed segregation towards the elite parent detected in the 97103 × pi 296341-fr ril population reinforces the hypothesis that such distortion likely originated from unintentional selection of genes in the elite parent that may be associated with fruit and seed production  during ril line development  <cit> . given that sdrs were not detected in the crosses between two elite cultivars and the elite × egusi type, the introgression of novel, economically important alleles from exotic watermelon germplasm into elite modern cultivars should be relatively unimpeded by the use of elite × egusi type crosses during watermelon improvement.

phenotypic performance of the 97103 × pi 296341-fr population for sugar content traits
the elite line  <dig> had higher values than pi 296341-fr for all four sugar content traits measured . transgressive segregation was observed in the ril population for fructose, glucose and sucrose content, while the averages for soluble solid content  and sucrose were skewed towards the citron parent. shifts of mean brix values towards the citron parent have been observed previously in elite × citron populations  <cit> . the total sucrose content in the ril population was much lower than the elite parent , probably because the sucrose is broken down by invertase into fructose and glucose  <cit>  in the ril population leading to fructose-accumulating fruit types. the heritability  of the sugar content traits was relatively high , except for sucrose  . the estimate of σg <dig> was highly significant  for all traits. heritability of brix  was much higher than observed by sandlin et al.  <cit>  . however, the latter study included two different locations, whereas the current study measured data at a single location over two years.

significant  genotype by environment interactions  for traits were also observed. gei variance was primarily due to differences in the magnitudes of the genetic variances among the environments, rather than a lack of genetic correlations between environments. significant positive correlations  were observed for the phenotypic and genetic correlations among traits across two environments .

qtl in bold were detected in both years. ci: confidence intervals. add effect: positive additive effect means parental cultivar  <dig> contributed the favorable alleles.

qtl for brix
four qtl were detected for brix using joint analysis , with additive effects ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and r <dig> values from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. two of the qtl  are located on chromosome  <dig> and both have r2 > 20%. as expected, the elite parental cultivar  contributed the favorable alleles at all loci.

ci: confidence intervals. add effect: positive additive effect means parental cultivar  <dig> contributed the favorable alleles.

qtl for fructose
five different qtl  associated with fructose were detected on chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> , and chromosome  <dig>  using joint analysis. r <dig> values ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. two of the fructose qtl on chromosome  <dig>  co-localized with qtl associated with brix .

qtl for glucose
only one qtl was detected for glucose according to single environment analysis, as well as on the joint analysis across environments . this qtl  co-localized with the qtl for fructose on chromosome  <dig> 

qtl for sucrose
three different qtl associated with sucrose were detected on chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig>  based on single and joint analysis. qsur2- <dig> and qsur2- <dig> were located in the same chromosomal regions where the brix  and fructose  qtl mapped .

the allele from the parental cultivar  <dig> was associated with higher sugar content for all the loci detected.

integration of qtl information
the  <dig> qtl previously reported for  <dig> traits  <cit>   and the  <dig> newly identified qtl for brix, sucrose, fructose and glucose content  were placed onto the integrated map . qtl described in sandlin et al.  <cit>  were re-named to reflect chromosomal location in the integrated map  rather than the linkage groups of the original study . the integration of all the qtl on the integrated map makes it possible to more precisely compare the location of qtl mapped in different populations and to use the physical map locations of the markers to identify candidate genes for specific traits.

comparison of brix qtl in accession-specific linkage maps showed brix qtl located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . three different qtl on chromosome  <dig> were associated with brix in the three different genetic backgrounds . qbrix2- <dig> identified in 97103 × pi 296341-fr and qbrx2- <dig> identified previously in the kbs × nhm were the only qtl for brix that were co-localized across populations. the possible explanation is that the variability of brix in the different genetic backgrounds are largely controlled by different loci, including major qtl with large effects on chromosome  <dig> and a number of qtl with lower effects on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

one of the major brix qtl  was co-localized with major qtl for fructose  and sucrose  in 2bin20-2bin <dig>  the 2bin20-2bin <dig> region is in a large interval of about 4 mb containing  <dig> genes. the other major brix qtl  that co-localizes with fructose  and sucrose  qtl in the 2bin3-2bin <dig> region spans an interval of  <dig>  mb and contains  <dig> genes. the mean glucose content  in the ril population was much lower than the fructose  and sucrose content . the possible reason why brix qtl was co-localized with fructose and sucrose qtl is that fructose and sucrose are the main components of total sugar content , while the glucose content can only contribute a little to total sugar accumulation.

the major qtl for seed size  identified by prothro et al.  <cit>  in the elite × elite  and elite × citron  populations co-localized on the integrated map . the regions between the flanking markers spans  <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  mbp in the two populations respective, with a  <dig>  mbp overlap, containing  <dig> predicted genes.

in addition to comparing the location of qtl across different populations, the integrated map is also useful to identify potential additional polymorphic markers in important chromosomal regions. the egusi  locus associated with the high oil, edible egusi-type seed was previously mapped between marker nw <dig> and nw <dig>  <cit> . this  <dig>  cm section represents a  <dig>  mbp segment in the draft genome, containing  <dig> genes. the integrated map now gives us the opportunity to use the additional  <dig> ssr and  <dig> indel markers in this region  to narrow the region of interest by potentially mapping these markers in the population of interest.

interestingly,  <dig> economically important qtl corresponding to  <dig> fruit traits  were detected on chromosome  <dig> . one possible explanation for the co-localization of fruit size and fruit sugar content qtl is that fruit maturity was a confounding factor, especially in populations that segregate widely for time to fruit maturity. however, both the current study and sandlin et al.  <cit>  tried to limit this potentially confounding factor. it remains to be seen whether fruit maturity played a role in co-localization for fruit sugar content and fruit size qtl.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed an integrated map which consisted of  <dig> ssr,  <dig> indels,  <dig> sv and  <dig> snp markers from four independent mapping populations, which includes the three subspecies of watermelon. the integrated map described herein enhances the utility of genomic tools over previous watermelon genetic maps, such as those used in map-based cloning and sequenced scaffolds anchoring and orientation. a large proportion of the markers in the integrated map are ssrs, indels and snps, which are easily transferable across laboratories. moreover, the populations used to construct the integrated map include genotypes in broad horticultural groups , guaranteeing the future utility of the markers in a broad range of cultivars and experimental crosses. the high marker density of the map allows for the selection of specific markers to customize mapping and molecular breeding applications, that will be useful for positional cloning of important genes, identification of qtl, mas, the development of novel genetic stocks , analysis of germplasm and detection of commercial hybrid seeds  <cit> .

fifty-eight previously reported quantitative trait loci  for  <dig> traits were integrated into the map and  <dig> new qtl for sugar content were identified. the positioning of economically important qtl in the integrated map facilitate comparative qtl analyses among populations of different origins to provide deeper insights into the genetic control of the diverse phenotypic variability observable in watermelon germplasm. for example, qtl for brix on chromosome  <dig> co-localize with qtl associated with fwt, fl, fwd, rth and fsi, suggesting, perhaps, the existence of pleiotropic effects with fruit maturity. multi-population analysis is a more powerful approach for detecting qtl/candidate gene associations. for instance, in the two major qtl on chromosome  <dig> involved in brix , annotated genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism, transport and corresponding regulation genes may become candidate genes for those qtl  <cit> .
