BACKGROUND
in addition to constitutive factors, plants may also launch chemical defense in response to herbivore attack. two types of plant defenses have been reported: basal defense  and resistance  gene-mediated defense   <cit> . basal defense is present in all plants and is triggered by a general perception of parasite-derived general elicitors   <cit> . suppression of basal defense leads to plant susceptibility and parasite establishment. r gene-mediated defense exists only in plants with an effective r gene and is triggered by a specific recognition between a plant r protein and a parasite avirulence  effector  <cit> . the recognition of parasite effectors in both basal and r gene-mediated defenses lead to the production of the signaling molecules such as salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , nitric oxide, ethylene, and various polyunsaturated fatty acids   <cit> . these signaling molecules trigger cascades of signal transduction pathways, leading to the launch of toxic chemical defenses and a transient reduction in primary metabolism  <cit> .

in recent decades, rapid advances have been achieved in elucidation of molecular processes in plant defense. numerous plant resistance genes have been cloned and many key components in defense signaling pathways have been identified  <cit> . the characterization of resistance genes and signaling molecules has greatly enriched our understanding of plant defenses at the molecular level. in addition, global approaches including microarrays and metabolite profiling have also been adapted to elucidate changes in metabolic pathways that result in plant resistance or susceptibility in response to herbivore attack  <cit> . despite these advances, however, our understanding of molecular events in plant defense is far from comprehensive. most of our understanding of plant defense is from studies of plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . little is known regarding the molecular pathways that lead to plant defense against insects, especially plant resistance to piercing-sucking insects  <cit> . only two resistance genes conferring plant resistance to insects have been molecularly identified so far, the tomato mi- <dig>  gene, which has been found to confer resistance to some isolates of macrosiphum euphorbiae  and bemisia tabaci   <cit> ; and the virus aphid transmission  gene, which has been found to control resistance to aphis gossypii   <cit> . global analysis of changes in gene expression in host plants following insect attack has also been limited to a few plant – insect systems  <cit> .

the hessian fly  is a member of a large group of insects called gall midges and can be a destructive pest of wheat  <cit> . hessian fly larvae live between leaf-sheaths of a wheat plant. unlike other gall midges which induce the formation of outgrowth galls on plants, a hessian fly larva converts the whole susceptible plant into a gall by inducing the formation of nutritive cells and a nutrient sink at the feeding site just above the base of a wheat seedling, and by inhibiting plant growth  <cit> . failure to induce formation of nutritive cells in plants results in the death of hessian fly larvae, as seen in resistant wheat plants that contain an effective resistance gene  <cit> . wheat resistance to hessian fly is controlled by major dominant resistance genes that exhibit a typical gene-for-gene relationship with insect avirulence  <cit> . several studies have been carried out to investigate genes that are likely involved in plant resistance, including genes encoding lectin-like proteins  <cit> , proteinase inhibitors  <cit> , enzymes involved in cell wall metabolism  <cit> , enzymes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species  <cit> , enzymes involved in primary metabolism  <cit> , and proteins involved in lipid metabolism  <cit> . these studies on specific groups of genes have enhanced our understanding of wheat – hessian fly interactions. a more systematic approach to examine global changes in gene expression in wheat plants following hessian fly attack is also needed to reveal molecular pathways of wheat defense against this pest.

an initial study using dna microarray identified numerous genes that are either up- or down-regulated in plants during incompatible and compatible interactions after 72 h following hessian fly infestation  <cit> . recently, we found that wheat defense responses to hessian fly attack occur much earlier and more rapidly than originally thought  <cit> . early response genes are most likely to determine wheat resistance or susceptibility to hessian fly infestation. the objectives of this study were 1) to conduct global analyses of gene expression using microarrays and other tools to identify early response genes in resistant plants during incompatible interactions, 2) to identify early response genes in susceptible plants during compatible interactions, and 3) to identify key pathways that are crucial for plant resistance by comparing the dynamic differences of gene expression and metabolite accumulation during incompatible and compatible interactions. our results indicate that a combination of rapid resource mobilization, elevated toxic chemicals, and cell wall fortification at the early stage plays a central role in wheat resistance to the hessian fly.

RESULTS
hessian fly induces rapid and large scale changes in wheat gene expression
to assess the impact of hessian fly infestation on wheat gene expression, affymetrix wheat microarrays were used to identify up- and down-regulated genes in resistant plants during incompatible interactions, and in susceptible plants during compatible interactions, respectively, following hessian fly infestation. microarray data were then validated through quantitative real-time pcr  . as shown in figure 1a, a large number of probe sets detected significant changes in transcript abundance in both resistant and susceptible plants following hessian fly infestation. however, the trends of the changes were different between resistant and susceptible plants. in resistant plants, many more probe sets detected significant changes in transcript abundance at  <dig> and 12 h than at  <dig> and 72 h. just the opposite occurred in susceptible plants; more probe sets detected significant changes in transcript abundance at  <dig> and 72 h than at  <dig> and 12 h. specifically,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets, representing  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of the total  <dig>  probe sets contained in the microarray, detected statistically significant  changes in transcript abundance in resistant plants at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h, respectively . in comparison,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  representing  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of the total probe sets, detected significant changes in transcript abundance at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 72 h, respectively, in susceptible plants following hessian fly infestation. most probe sets that detected changes significant at p ≤  <dig>  also detected changes significant at p ≤  <dig>  .

another difference between resistant and susceptible plants is the numbers of probe sets that detected down-regulation in comparison with those that detected up-regulation . in resistant plants, at least 30% more probe sets detected down-regulation compared with those that detected up-regulation at earlier time points , and roughly equal or less numbers of probe sets detected down-regulation at later time points . in comparison, in susceptible plants, the numbers of probe sets detected down-regulation were roughly equal or less than those that detected up-regulation at all time points .

for up-regulated transcripts, much larger magnitude changes were observed in resistant plants at earlier time points . specifically, an average increase of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold was observed at  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h, respectively, but only  <dig>  fold at 72 h in resistant plants following hessian fly infestation. in comparison, there was no great difference in up-regulated transcripts at different time points in susceptible plants. specifically,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  average fold of up-regulation were observed in susceptible plants at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h. for down-regulated transcripts, an average of about  <dig> fold  down-regulation was at  <dig>   <dig>  24 h and about  <dig> fold down-regulation at 72 h in infested resistant plants. in comparison, a bigger down-regulation was observed at earlier time points in infested susceptible plants. approximately  <dig> fold down-regulation was observed at  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h, and about  <dig> fold at 72 h .

early response genes differ from late response genes
to examine if similar or different gene sets in wheat were affected at different time periods during hessian fly infestation, we analyzed if genes up- or down-regulated at one time point were also up- or down-regulated at a different time point. the genes that were regulated in the same direction, namely up-regulated in both time points under comparison or down-regulated in both time points, were referred to as ‘commonly regulated’. higher percentages of commonly regulated transcripts were observed when data from two early time points were compared, whereas lower percentages of commonly regulated transcripts were observed when data from an early time point were compared with data from the late 72 h time point . specifically, in resistant plants,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of the affected transcripts were commonly up-regulated when data from  <dig> and 12 h,  <dig> and 24 h, and  <dig> and 24 h, respectively, were compared; whereas  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % were commonly down-regulated at these time-point combinations. in susceptible plants,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of the affected transcripts were commonly up-regulated when data from  <dig> and 12 h,  <dig> and 24 h, and  <dig> and 24 h, respectively, were compared; and  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % were commonly down-regulated at these respective time point combinations. in contrast, fewer than 35% of the affected transcripts were commonly regulated when data from an earlier time point were compared with data from the late 72 h time point in either resistant or susceptible plants. the biphasic nature of the results shown in figure 2a suggested that early response genes  differ from late response genes  in both infested resistant and susceptible plants.

genes affected by hessian fly in resistant plants differ from those in susceptible plants
to determine if wheat gene sets affected by hessian fly in resistant plants were similar or different from those affected in susceptible plants, we analyzed the percentages of transcripts that were commonly regulated  in both resistant and susceptible plants at the same or different time points. as shown in figure 2ba, less than 42% of the affected transcripts were commonly regulated in both resistant and susceptible plants at any given time, indicating that the majority of the genes affected by hessian fly in resistant plants were different from those in susceptible plants.

since responses to a pathogen’s attack are often delayed in susceptible plants  <cit> , we further analyzed if delayed responses were the reason for the low percentages of commonly regulated transcripts by comparing data from resistant plants at an earlier time with the data from susceptible plants at a later time. the results revealed a different pattern between up-regulated and down-regulated transcripts . specifically,  <dig> to 36% of the transcripts up-regulated in resistant plants at an earlier time were also up-regulated in susceptible plants at a later time. for down-regulated transcripts, higher percentages,  <dig> to 51%, of the transcripts down-regulated in resistant plants at an earlier time were also down-regulated in susceptible plants at a later time. these results suggest that there was little delayed response associated with gene up-regulation, but delayed response was more significant with genes down-regulated in susceptible plants.

we also analyzed the percentages of transcripts that were regulated in opposite directions in resistant and susceptible plants . at the first 24 h, 5-16% of the transcripts up-regulated in resistant plants were down-regulated in susceptible plants, and vice versa . at 72 h,  <dig> % of transcripts up-regulated in resistant plants were down-regulated in susceptible plants; and  <dig> % of transcripts down-regulated in resistant plants were up-regulated in susceptible plants. we also compared data from resistant plants at an earlier time point with data from susceptible plants at a later time point . there appears to be no significant delayed response in terms of oppositely regulated genes in resistant and susceptible plants during the test period. overall, results suggest that wheat gene sets affected by hessian fly infestation in resistant plants were quite different from those affected in susceptible plants.

defense genes are expressed consistently at higher levels in infested resistant plants
to examine what gene types were differentially regulated between resistant and susceptible plants, we analyzed the functional categories of the affected  genes. most of the affected genes could not be annotated and therefore their functions were unknown. genes with known functions were classified into  <dig> categories: genes involved in direct toxic defense , genes involved in lipid metabolism , genes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism , genes involved in cell wall and cuticle metabolism , genes involved in reduction/oxidation , genes encoding proteases , genes involved in regulation , genes encoding structural proteins , genes involved in nutrient metabolism , genes involved in stress response , and genes with other functions .

to identify genes that may play important roles in wheat defense against hessian fly, we examined the ratio between the relative transcript abundance in resistant plants during incompatible interactions and those in susceptible plants during compatible interactions  . a positive i/c ratio  indicates a higher level of transcript in resistant plants in comparison with that in susceptible plants, whereas a negative i/c ratio indicates a lower level of transcript in resistant plants compared with that in susceptible plants. even though each gene category exhibited quite a different pattern of i/c ratio distribution, some gene categories share certain degree of similarity. for the gene categories of ‘direct defense’, ‘lipid metabolism’, ‘phenylpropanoid’, ‘cell wall’, and ‘redox’, the majority of transcripts exhibited a positive i/c ratio, especially during the first 24 h. these gene categories have been reported to be involved in plant defense  <cit> . for ‘protease’ genes, the numbers of transcripts exhibited higher or lower i/c ratio were roughly the same. however, many transcripts encoding cysteine proteases exhibited very high levels of abundance during the first 24 h in resistant plants, making the graph asymmetrical towards higher levels of transcript abundance in resistant plants . genes encoding cysteine proteases have been reported to be induced in plants for toxic defense  <cit> . for the other gene categories including ‘regulation’, ‘structure’, ‘nutrition’, and ‘stress response’, roughly equal numbers of transcripts exhibited positive and negative i/c ratio. clearly, defense-related genes, including genes involved in direct defense, lipid metabolism, phenylpropanoid metabolism, cell wall and cuticle metabolism, and redox were expressed at higher levels in resistant plants than those in susceptible plants, whereas other categories of genes exhibited no significant differences in expression levels in infested resistant and susceptible plants.

genes for resource mobilization are up-regulated rapidly in infested resistant plants
rapid mobilization and re-utilization of resources is a necessary process for plant defense, and involves catabolic enzymes and transporters. the largest group among the genes encoding catabolic enzymes and transporters were ‘lipid metabolism’ genes encoding lipases, lipid transfer proteins, and other down-stream lipid-catabolic enzymes . over 72% of the  <dig> transcripts of the ‘lipid’ genes were up-regulated in infested resistant plants, whereas less than 28% of the transcripts were down-regulated in these plants . in contrast, less than 32% of these transcripts were up-regulated in susceptible plants at 24 h or earlier, but increased to ~50% at 72 h. the magnitudes of up-regulation in resistant plants were much stronger as well . specifically, the average fold changes of these ‘lipid’ genes were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h, compared with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  average fold increases in susceptible plants during the same period. analyses of  <dig> transcripts encoding other types of transporters  and  <dig> transcripts encoding other catabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism  revealed a similar trend, higher percentages of up-regulated transcripts with greater magnitude of up-regulation at earlier time points  in infested resistant plants compared with susceptible plants. no such trend was observed in a similar analysis of  <dig> transcripts encoding various anabolic enzymes .

the greater proportion and higher magnitudes of up-regulated genes encoding catabolic enzymes and transporters in resistant plants suggest that certain types of substances include lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins/amino acids were mobilized for plant defense. since lipid-related transcripts were the largest group of changes and with the highest average fold of increases, we measured metabolites of lipid metabolism in control and infested wheat seedlings. the changes in lipid metabolites suggested rapid mobilization of membrane lipids and extensive membrane remodeling in resistant plants following hessian fly infestation . a significant reduction of certain membrane lipids was observed predominantly in resistant plants, including 1-linoleoyl-glycerophosphoethamine  , 2-oleoyl-glycerophosphocholine  , 1-oleoyl-glycerophosphocholine  , 1-palmitoyl-glycerophosphocholine  , 1-palmitoyl-glycerophosphoethamine  , 1-palmitoyl-glyerophosphoinositol  , and 1-palmitoylglyerol  . in association with membrane lipid reduction, the abundance of a range of fatty acids and derivatives, including  <dig> -epoxyoctadec-12-enoic acid, 2-hydroxypalmitate, 8-hydroxyoctanoate, palmitate , oleate , vaccinate , and eicosenoate , was elevated specifically in resistant plants . in addition, the intermediates in phospholipid metabolic pathways including glycerol, glycerol 3-phosphate , glycerophosphoethamine, and glycerophosphorylcholine , were elevated predominantly in infested resistant plants. the reduction in the abundance of membrane lipids and the elevation of fatty acids and other intermediates indicated that membrane lipids were mobilized for defense.

direct toxic defense genes are up-regulated in infested resistant plants
membrane remodeling and mobilization of lipids release resources that are likely used for defense against hessian fly attack. the types of defenses that are essential for the death of hessian fly larvae remain to be determined. transcripts encoding proteins that are toxic or enzymes that can produce toxic chemicals to insects exhibited increased abundance in infested resistant plants. these transcripts encode  <dig> proteinase inhibitors, six lectins,  <dig> oxalate oxidases,  <dig> peroxidases,  <dig> defense proteases , and nine thionins/defensins . proteinase inhibitors, lectins, cysteine proteases, and thionins have been previously reported as potential toxic chemicals against hessian fly and other insect pests in different crops  <cit> . oxalate oxidases and peroxidases catalyze the production of hydrogen peroxide, which is toxic to pathogens and insects  <cit> . in addition, secondary metabolites produced by elevated expression of genes involved in phenylpropanoid pathways .

hessian fly larvae die in resistant plants after  <dig> to 96 h  <cit> . to determine if toxic chemicals are sufficient for causing the death of hessian fly larvae, a rescue assay was performed with larvae fed on resistant plants for  <dig> and 48 h, respectively. hessian fly larvae that had fed in resistant molly plants were washed off after dissecting the plants, and the larvae were then put back individually onto a new, susceptible newton plant to determine if larvae fed in resistant plants could be rescued by shifting to susceptible plants. as shown in figure 4b, larvae fed in resistant plants can be rescued by transferring them onto susceptible plants. no statistically significant difference was observed between larvae fed on resistant molly and control larvae fed on susceptible newton for the same time periods before being transferred to a new susceptible plant. the results suggest that toxic defense alone in resistant plants did not cause immediate lethality of hessian fly larvae.

up-regulation of ‘phenylpropanoid’ genes are associated with increased accumulation of phenylpropanoids in infested resistant plants
a large number of probe sets detected higher levels of transcripts encoding various enzymes in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway in infested resistant plants . the first four chemical reactions in the phenylpropanoid pathway produce the common intermediate cinnamoyl-coa, which is then converted into various phenylpropanoids through down-stream pathways . the enzymes involved in these chemical reactions include phenylalanine ammonia-lyases, cinnamate 4-hydroxylases, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases, and cinnamoyl-coa reductases. transcripts encoding these enzymes were strongly up-regulated in resistant plants, especially at  <dig> and 12 h after hessian fly infestation. in most cases, no or slight up-regulation of these transcripts was observed in infested susceptible plants. the most dramatic up-regulated transcripts were the ones encoding for phenylalanine ammonia-lyases. for the  <dig> transcripts encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyases, transcript abundance increased  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h, respectively, in resistant plants during incompatible interactions, and only  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold at the same period of time in susceptible plants during compatible interactions, giving i/c ratios  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. transcripts encoding cinnamate 4-hyroxylases, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases, and cinnaoyl-coa-reductases were also up-regulated 2– <dig> fold in infested resistant plants at  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h; whereas no significant change or down-regulation was observed in infested susceptible plants.

the strong up-regulation of transcripts indicated elevated production of phenylpropanoids. the abundance of two representative phenylpropanoids, 4-hydroxy-cinnamate and vanillin, was determined using mass spectrometry . both were significantly elevated in infested resistant plants, especially at 12 h. no significant changes were observed in susceptible plants during the same time period.

up-regulation of cell wall genes is associated with epidermal impermeability of wheat cells to the neutral red dye in infested resistant plants
the majority of transcripts encoding enzymes directly involved in cell wall and cuticle metabolism, including  <dig> expansins,  <dig> xyloglucan endotransglycosylases, five xyloglucan fucosyltransferases,  <dig> glucanases, nine pectinesterases, and nine eceriferum  exhibited higher levels of abundance in infested resistant plants . expansins are cell wall components participating in cell wall loosening  <cit> . xyloglucan endotransglycosylases and other enzymes are involved in various processes of cell wall biogenesis  <cit> . transcripts encoding these proteins and enzymes were up-regulated on average at least  <dig> fold in resistant plants at  <dig> and 12 h after hessian fly infestation. in comparison, the abundance of the transcripts decreased, did not change, or was slightly up-regulated at the same time period in infested susceptible plants.

to examine if elevated expression of cell wall-related genes correlates with cell wall fortification in resistant plants following hessian fly attack, neutral red staining of cell wall penetration was conducted. in susceptible newton plants following hessian fly attack, a weakened cell wall was indicated by increased epidermal cell permeability, as suggested by strong uptake of the neutral red dye . in comparison, epidermal cell permeability did not increase in resistant molly plants following hessian fly attack , suggesting that cell wall and cuticle were strengthened in resistant plants after hessian fly infestation and larvae were unable to increase cell wall permeability in these plants.

discussion
in this study, we analyzed changes in gene expression at multiple times following hessian fly infestation in two nearly-isogenic wheat lines, susceptible newton and its resistant backcross-offspring molly  <cit> . a large number of transcripts exhibited significant changes in both resistant and susceptible wheat plants. in-depth analyses indicated that the gene sets in resistant plants affected by hessian fly were quite different from those affected in susceptible plants, and early response genes were different from late response genes. comparative analyses of the dynamic differences in gene expression in the resistant and susceptible wheat lines indicated that rapid mobilization and re-utilization of resources, enhanced direct toxic defense, and fortification of cell walls are coordinated defense processes that may be crucial for hessian fly resistance in wheat .

preservation and rapid mobilization of resources for defense in infested resistant plants
in plants with an effective r gene, plant growth is transiently suppressed following hessian fly larval attack  <cit> . the primary metabolic pathways were also transiently suppressed in resistant plants following hessian fly infestation  <cit> . this transient suppression of plant growth and primary metabolism are likely an important step to preserve resources to launch plant defense . a great proportion of transcripts encoding enzymes in catabolic pathways, including lipases, lipid transfer proteins and a range of other transporters, sugar degradation enzymes, and amino acid degradation enzymes, were up-regulated with great magnitudes specifically in infested resistant plants . the prompt up-regulation of catabolic enzymes indicates a prompt increase in degradation metabolism to release substances and energy needed for defense. the strong up-regulation of a large number of lipase and lipid transfer protein genes indicate that membrane remodeling and subsequent release of membrane lipids may be crucial to provide resources for defense. mobilized lipids can be easily converted into defense molecules such as oxylipins, wax, and cutin components with small chemical modifications  <cit> . degradation metabolism of lipids can also provide high energy for defense biosynthesis  <cit> . in consistent with the up-regulation of lipid mobilization genes, the abundance of various membrane lipids decreased, whereas a range of fatty acids and derivatives increased in resistant plants following hessian fly attack , indicating that the mobilized membrane lipids were indeed in the process to be converted into molecules for cell wall and cuticle strengthening and the launch of other types of defenses. in addition to mobilization of lipids, other substances including sugars, proteins, and amino acids are also likely mobilized . the mobilization of membrane lipids and other nutrients is consistent with a sharp decrease in nutrient metabolism in resistant plants following hessian fly attack  <cit> , a metabolic cost for plants to launch chemical defense.

direct toxic defense may slow down larval attack, but does not cause immediate lethality
a large number of transcripts encoding toxic proteins, including inhibitors of insect digestive enzymes, lectins, and cysteine proteases were up-regulated or exhibited higher levels of abundance in infested resistant plants , indicating that direct defense may play an important role in wheat defense against hessian fly infestation. in addition to proteins that are directly toxic to hessian fly, several types of transcripts encoding enzymes that can produce toxic chemicals were also up-regulated, including oxalate oxidases and class iii peroxidases , both of which can produce reactive oxygen species  <cit> ; and enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathways, which can produce toxic secondary metabolites. the broad range of the up-regulated toxins indicates a possible strong effect of direct defense on hessian fly larvae. however, the exact effect of toxic chemicals in plant resistance remains to be delineated. a rescue assay indicated that toxicity from defense chemicals in infested resistant plants did not translate into immediate lethality of hessian fly larvae . this observation is consistent with a recent report that virulent larvae can rescue avirulent larvae in otherwise resistant plants within three days after hatching  <cit> . even though toxic chemicals alone could not kill hessian fly larvae immediately, the chemicals may slow down larval attack  <cit> , and therefore, allow more time for the plants to launch or enhance other types of defenses. potential long term effect of toxins on hessian fly development and reproduction remains to be determined.

rapid remodeling and fortification of cell walls may make fly larvae starve to death
since toxicity alone did not kill hessian fly larvae, additional defense mechanism must be in play for the observed insect antibiosis in resistant wheat. rapid remodeling and fortification of cell walls could play a key role by preventing hessian fly larvae from accessing nutrients, causing the insects to die. various types of transcripts encoding enzymes and proteins potentially involved in cell wall and cuticle strengthening are promptly and highly up-regulated specifically in resistant plants after larval attack. these proteins and enzymes, including expansins, xyloglucan transglycosylases, xyloglucan fucosyltransferases, glucanases, pectineste-rases, and cer <dig> proteins, participate in various processes in cell wall loosening, remodeling, and fortification . in addition, increased production of various phenolics produced as a result of elevated gene expression in the phenylpropanoid pathway could have been deposited into the cell wall for strengthening   <cit> . a large number of transcripts encoding class iii perxoidases are quickly up-regulated in resistant wheat following hessian fly attack   <cit> . class iii peroxidases can produce reactive oxygen species at extracellular space in response to parasite attack  <cit> . elevated levels of reactive oxygen species can enhance cross-linking of deposited phenolics, resulting in fortified cell walls. furthermore, portion of mobilized membrane lipids could have been converted into wax and cutins  <cit> , providing additional cell impermeability in infested resistant plants. consistent with above observations, our data with neutral red staining demonstrated that hessian fly larvae were unable to increase cell wall permeability in infested resistant plants, suggesting that cell wall and cuticle were indeed strengthened in these plants. fortified cell walls could prevent hessian fly larvae from delivering effectors into wheat cells, preventing the insect from manipulating normal host tissue into nutritive tissues  <cit> . the lack of nutritive tissues prevents hessian fly larvae from obtaining nutrition from host cells in resistant plants, resulting in their death.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, resistant wheat plants undergo rapid and coordinated responses to mobilize resources through remodeling cell membranes and likely other cellular structures to release substances and energy needed for plant defense in response to hessian fly infestation . the mobilized resources are likely converted into toxic molecules, which may slow down insect attack and give plants more time to effectively launch or enhance other defense mechanisms. a swift remodeling and fortification of cell walls and cuticle may prevent hessian fly larvae from delivering effectors into host cells, thus inhibiting nutritive tissue formation. the lack of nutritive tissue at the feeding site prohibits hessian fly larvae from obtaining host nutrients, resulting in insect death due to malnutrition. susceptible wheat is unable to quickly mobilize resources or convert them into defense molecules. as a result, plants are being manipulated by hessian fly larvae, resulting in the formation of plant nutritive tissue and thriving of insects. further research is needed to elucidate how a resistance protein detects hessian fly larval attack, and promptly initiates signaling for the coordinated defense reactions as observed in this study.
