BACKGROUND
the endosymbiotic origins of plastids and mitochondria share a number of characteristics in common,  <cit> , but differ in the complexity of their evolutionary history following their origin and initial integration. whereas mitochondria originated once and have apparently never been lost  <cit> , plastids have spread between eukaryotic lineages several times in events referred to as secondary and tertiary endosymbioses. generally these secondary and tertiary endosymbionts have degenerated so far that all that remains is a plastid with extra membranes  <cit> , but in a few exceptional cases intermediate stages of reduction are known, and these may provide interesting glimpses into how complexity is lost.

one of the characters that is absent from nearly all known examples of secondary and tertiary endosymbionts is the mitochondrion. this contrasts with the fact that mitochondria have never been lost in any other eukaryotic lineage. even in the most severely reduced, anaerobic parasites which lack oxidative phosphorylation, highly reduced organelles called mitosomes and hydrogenosomes are found  <cit> . some of these have no direct role in energy metabolism, but iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis is a common function  <cit> . these relict organelles suggest mitochondria are resistant to outright loss, raising questions about why mitochondria appear to be one of the more dispensable features of algae taken up during secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis events.

the single clear exception to this is found in a group of related dinoflagellates that harbour a diatom tertiary endosymbiont. this group contains several species , and here we have examined two: durinskia baltica  <cit>  and kryptoperidinium foliaceum  <cit> . several of these genera  have been shown to share a common pennate diatom endosymbiont, arguing that the endosymbiosis is stable through evolutionary time  <cit> . interestingly, this may not hold for the whole group, since the endosymbiont of peridinium quinquecorne is a centric diatom  <cit> , suggesting that the integration may have spanned a long period of time and different transient endosymbionts were ultimately fixed in these two subgroups. nevertheless, the endosymbionts of d. baltica and k. foliaceum are no longer transient in the short term, they have lost motility and cell wall and, although some chromatin condensation occurs during sexual reproduction in d. baltica, typical chromosomes are not found within the endosymbiont nucleus at any stage of its life cycle  <cit> . during the endosymbiotic nuclear division, neither a spindle apparatus nor any microtubules have been observed  <cit> , and the amitotic division of this nucleus results in unequal daughter nuclei and significantly larger amount of dna in the nucleus than that reported in other diatoms  <cit> .

the endosymbiont has clearly been reduced in many ways, but some of its most interesting characteristics are what it has retained. this includes plastids surrounded by endoplasmic reticulum  that is continuous with the outer membrane of the nucleus, a plasma membrane that separates it from the host cytoplasm, a multi-lobed, prominent nucleus with a genome, ribosomes, dictyosomes, and mitochondria  <cit> .

it is the retention of mitochondria that makes this endosymbiont stand out, in particular since d. baltica and k. foliaceum host cells have also been reported to retain mitochondria. the loss of endosymbiont mitochondria in virtually all known examples of secondary and tertiary endosymbiotic events suggests retaining two mitochondria is either unnecessary or even deleterious. the loss of one of these organelles may be ongoing, but it is also possible that both compartments require mitochondrial function or that they have distributed essential functions between them. we have previously shown  <cit>  that the k. foliaceum endosymbiont mitochondrion contains a genome and expresses genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> , cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> , and cytochrome b . however, no data are available from the host mitochondrion, and with the function of this organelle completely unknown we cannot address the possibility that the two organelles have overlapping or differentiated function.

in order to determine whether this unique mitochondrial redundancy extends to the functional level, we characterized seven mitochondrial genes of d. baltica: five from the endosymbiont  and two from the host , and confirmed that cox <dig> and lsurrna from the endosymbiont and cox <dig> from the host are also present in k. foliaceum. most significantly, in d. baltica, cox <dig> and cob are present and expressed in both mitochondria, and those in the host are heavily edited, as expected for a functional dinoflagellate mitochondrial gene  <cit> . all available data therefore suggest that both the host and endosymbiont mitochondria are actively expressing genes functional in oxidative phosphorylation and energy production.

RESULTS
characterization of endosymbiont mitochondrial genes and transcripts
pcr amplification using diatom-specific primers and total d. baltica dna , resulted in fragments of the expected sizes for five genes: cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cob, cox <dig>  and lsurrna. sequencing multiple clones yielded a single copy of each gene. only a short fragment of cox <dig> could be amplified from dna, probably due to the presence of long type ii introns such as those found in diatoms phaeodactylum tricornutum and thalassiosira pseudonana and the endosymbiont of k. foliaceum  <cit> , so the remainder was recovered from rna by rt-pcr. diatom-derived genes for cox <dig>  cox <dig> and cob are already known from k. foliaceum  <cit> , so to complement the d. baltica data we also amplified the k. foliaceum cox <dig> and lsurrna.

the phylogenies of all five genes  generally resembled trees based on nuclear genes, with relatively strong support for the monophyly of alveolates and sister relationship between dinoflagellates and apicomplexans  <cit> . we also noted that haptophytes and cryptophytes are sister groups with strong support in cob trees  and weakly so in cox <dig> and cox <dig> trees , as has been suggested in other analyses  <cit> . most importantly, however, in all five phylogenies the distinction between the expected positions of host and endosymbiont-derived genes was unambiguous, and in all five trees the d. baltica gene amplified with diatom-specific primers branched within the diatom clade with strong support . moreover, d. baltica consistently grouped with k. foliaceum with strong support . this is in disagreement with the proposal that these dinoflagellates are products of separate endosymbiotic events  <cit> , but consistent with the analyses of nuclear small-subunit rrna genes from the hosts in these two dinoflagellates  <cit>  and the hypothesis that these two species, and most likely their other close relatives, resulted from a single endosymbiotic event  <cit> . together, d. baltica and k. foliaceum branched specifically with pennate diatoms , which is also consistent with evidence that the endosymbiont is a descendent of a pennate diatom  <cit> . overall, these trees strongly support the conclusion that cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cob, cox <dig>  and lsurrna are all present in the mitochondrial genome of the endosymbiont.

to confirm that all five genes are actively expressed, each was also amplified from rna using rt-pcr. all diatom-derived cdna sequences were identical to their corresponding genes, providing further evidence for these genes being from the endosymbiont mitochondrion, because the mitochondrial transcripts in dinoflagellates are extensively edited  <cit> .

characterization of host mitochondrial genes and transcripts
the presence and expression of cox and cob genes in the endosymbiont mitochondria suggests this organelle is engaged in electron transport. the pressing question is therefore the nature of the host organelle, but no data have been gathered from it for comparison. dinoflagellate mitochondrial genomes only encode three protein-coding genes: cox <dig>  cox <dig>  and cob  <cit> . the lsu rrna has been extensively fragmented and rearranged  <cit> , and cox <dig> has been split and moved to the nucleus  <cit> , so only cox <dig>  cox <dig>  and cob were sought in the mitochondrial genome. we used dinoflagellate-specific primers for all three genes in rt-pcr with total d. baltica rna, and identified fragments of cox <dig> and cob. using 3' race, we also recovered the 3' end of the d. baltica cob gene. we also recovered  <dig> additional copies of cox <dig> transcripts , each of which contained inserts that differed in position, size, and sequences, and disrupted the reading frame. inserts ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. two inserts at slightly different positions of rna <dig> and rna <dig> were similar in size and sequences, and both of these contained a  <dig> bp portion of the cob gene flanked by two small  non-coding fragments . another insert contained a  <dig> bp fragment with over 90% identity to non-coding fragments from the dinoflagellates alexandrium catenella  gonyaulax polyedra . we did not sequence a dna clone lacking an insert, but the mitochondrial genome of other dinoflagellates is known to contain many copies of each gene and many rearrangements  <cit> , so the intact copy of the gene was most likely simply not sampled. given the highly fragmented and divergent nature of dinoflagellate mitochondrial rrnas  <cit> , it is possible this  <dig> bp represents an as yet unidentified fragment of either the lsu or ssu.

pcr using genomic dna from d. baltica resulted in a single cob gene fragment , and six different cox <dig> fragments . as with cdnas, each cox <dig> gene contained a unique insert . most inserts were unique, but many contained small imperfect repeats in common, and the positions of the inserts within cox <dig> were variable and inevitably a portion of cox <dig> was missing at the point of insertion. one pair of dna and cdna clones  were found to be identical, with the exception of edited sites .

a single transcript of the k. foliaceum cox <dig> was also recovered from sequencing  <dig> identical clones. this transcript also contained an insert, but without sequence similarity to anything known and not at a position in common with any d. baltica clone. we failed to identify cob, but considering its presence in d. baltica we feel it is unlikely to be absent in k. foliaceum.

the many variants of the d. baltica host cox <dig> gene and the insert in the k. foliaceum cox <dig> gene are both consistent with the nature of mitochondrial genomes in other dinoflagellates. this has been best described in crypthecodinium cohni and amphidinium carterae, where protein-coding genes are flanked by non-coding, repeat-rich sequences and that the context of a gene can vary in different copies due to homologous recombination  <cit> , and in oxyrrhis marina where protein coding genes are found in different genomic contexts, and are often fragmented  <cit> .

host mitochondrial transcripts are extensively edited
dinoflagellate mitochondria possess a distinctive form of rna editing. editing sites typically involve a to g, t to c, and c to u changes at first and second positions, affecting about 2% of positions in cox <dig> and cob genes  <cit> . the presence of such editing would provide further evidence for the dinoflagellate mitochondrial location of the cox <dig> and cob genes identified here, so all d. baltica gene fragments were aligned to their respective transcripts and conserved editing sites examined. in total,  <dig> bp of cox <dig> were comparable, and  <dig> bp of cob were comparable, from which  <dig> and  <dig> edited sites were identified, respectively. the nature of these edits was similar to that of other dinoflagellates  and, significantly, all but three of the editing sites were conserved in other dinoflagellate mitochondria  <cit> . overall, the characteristics of this editing are consistent with these genes and cdnas being located in the dinoflagellate host mitochondria.

column  <dig> is the site numbered according to genes from crypthecodinium cohnii  or pfiesteria piscicida . column  <dig> and  <dig> are pre-edited and post-edited states in d. baltica. column  <dig> is the position within the codon. column  <dig> is the amino acid change. column  <dig> lists other dinoflagellates where the same editing is found. abbreviations: pp, pfiesteria piscicida; cc, crypthecodinium cohnii; pmic, prorocentrum micans; prorocentrum minimum; km, karlodinium micrum; ps, pfiesteria shumwyae; at, alexandrium tamarense.

reduction and functional redundancy of mitochondria
electron microscopy has shown that mitocondria exist in both the host and endosymbiont cytosolic compartments of d. baltica and k. foliaceum  <cit> . more recently diatom-derived genes for cox <dig>  cox <dig>  and cob have been shown to be expressed in k. foliaceum  <cit> . however, without comparable data from the host mitochondria it is impossible to determine whether the two organelles are functionally redundant, or have distributed functions between them. here, we have shown that both organelles contain at least two genes with central functions in electron transport, cox <dig> and cob. accordingly, these two species are unique among eukaryotes in having retained active, functional mitochondrial genomes from two distantly related eukaryotic lineages, the dinoflagellate host and the pennate diatom endosymbiont. moreover, these organelles now appear to be at least partially functionally redundant, since both express genes for proteins in the electron transport chain.

indeed, no characteristic of either host or endosymbiont mitochondrial genes or genomes has so far been shown to be significantly different from those of their dinoflagellate or diatom relatives, which points to the conclusion that neither organelle has been much affected by the presence of the other. it seems unlikely that the two mitochondria are retained due to functional differentiation, but their genetic redundancy may be related to spatial differentiation. if the membrane separating the host and the endosymbiont, which is thought to be derived from the diatom plasma membrane  <cit> , were deficient in transporters to efficiently shuttle either substrates or products of mitochondrial reactions between the two compartments, then neither compartment could eliminate those functions without consequences. in other endosymbiotic events such difficulties would have been overcome or made irrelevant by the continued reduction of the endosymbiont and integration with the host. whether the mitochondrion of d. baltica is a snapshot in the progression of events that will ultimately lead to its loss, or whether the process has been 'stuck' in some way is unknown. similarly, although it is generally assumed that the endosymbiont will be reduced and the corresponding host feature retained, this does not need to be the case. with the already highly reduced and unusual nature of dinoflagellate mitochondrial genome  <cit> , it is not unreasonable to hypothesize that the host organelle may be lost as easily as the relatively normal mitochondrion of the endosymbiont.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that two related dinoflagellates, d. baltica and k. foliaceum, retain redundant genes in their host-derived and endosymbiont-derived mitochondrial genomes, including several genes related to electron transport. host-derived genes are edited at the rna level and subject to extensive recombination, as is expected for dinoflagellate mitochondria. all genes characterized have been shown to be expressed at the mrna level, suggesting the two organelles overlap in function, making these unique among eukaryotes in retaining two partially redundant mitochondria with different evolutionary origins.
