BACKGROUND
chickpea  is an annual, self-pollinating, diploid  pulse crop that ranks third in world legume production  <cit> . australia is currently the largest exporter of chickpea and yield for 2006– <dig> has been forecasted at  <dig>  tonnes, most of which will be exported   <cit> . under optimum growing conditions, the yield potential of chickpea is  <dig> t/ha  <cit> , which is much higher than the current global yield average of ~ <dig>  t/ha  <cit> . the chief constraints in chickpea production are biotic stresses like ascochyta blight, fusarium wilt, pod borer, and abiotic stresses such as drought, heat, cold and high-salinity  <cit> . in fact, the estimated collective yield losses due to abiotic stresses  have been significantly higher than for biotic stresses   <cit> . drought, a severe abiotic stress of chickpea, causes a 40–50% reduction in yield globally  <cit> . the change from spring to winter sowing of chickpea for efficient utilization of rain water in mediterranean environments has enhanced yields, but demands tolerance to low temperature for further yield improvements  <cit> . most legumes are known to be salt sensitive  <cit> , and the increasing worldwide use of irrigation has led to the prediction that, by  <dig>  50% of all arable land will be salinized  <cit> . therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to produce cultivars tolerant to high-salinity in addition to other abiotic and biotic stresses for sustainable chickpea production.

the cultivated chickpea has a high morphological but narrow genetic variation  <cit> , which makes it difficult for breeders to produce elite cultivars with durable resistance to the many major biotic and abiotic stresses. molecular markers associated with quantitative trait loci  for resistance to biotic stresses and some morphological traits have been located on both interspecific  <cit>  and intraspecific linkage maps  <cit> . however compared to some biotic stresses, abiotic stresses are inherited in a more quantitative manner and may be subjective to assess under field conditions due to confounding environmental factors, which makes it difficult to screen for and quantitate tolerance. quantitating the effects of abiotic stresses involves measurement of various factors like survival rate, yield, dry matter production, days to maturity, flower/pod survival, root mass and transpiration ratio. their tolerances are likely to be quantitatively controlled and this feature of abiotic stresses represents a major obstacle to developing molecular markers.

marker-assisted breeding is increasingly targeted towards tracking the candidate genes responsible for stress tolerance through gene identification and functional studies  <cit> . candidate genes, identified and characterized through whole genome sequencing projects or expressed sequence tag  libraries, are assessed for their comparative transcriptional activity against biological reactions to specific plant stresses via microarray technologies. analysis of the expression and function/s of stress inducible genes facilitates understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the stress tolerance responses. this approach has potential to assist molecular plant breeders in improving stress tolerance by gene selection and/or genetic manipulation. gene expression studies using est-based cdna microarrays were pioneered by analysing  <dig> arabidopsis genes for differential expression in roots and shoots  <cit> . the technology has subsequently been used extensively to generate expression profiles of genes linked to drought, heat, cold and salt stresses  <cit> . in order to obtain a complete picture of a plant's response to stress, it would be ideal to study the expression profiles of all the genes in its genome. currently, this is only possible for model crops like arabidopsis thaliana , oryza sativa , medicago truncatula , populus trichocarpa  whose genomes have been sequenced. in near future it shall be possible for brachypodium distachyon, lotus japonicus , manihot esculenta , solanum lycopersicum , solanum tuberosum , sorghum bicolor and zea mays  whose genome sequencing shall be soon completed  <cit> . until this is available for other crops, researchers have to rely on information generated by studying these model crops and explore the est/cdna sequences from same/related species generated by various studies. for pulses, a set of chickpea unigenes  <cit> , grasspea ests  <cit>  and lentil rga sequences  enriched for stress-responsive transcripts have recently become available, allowing the construction of a boutique microarray.

the aim of the study was to utilize the pulse microarray to identify transcripts linked to biological reactions  against the major abiotic stresses of drought, cold and high-salinity in chickpea. expression profiling of chickpea genotypes tolerant and susceptible to these abiotic stresses was performed and the transcripts differentially expressed between stressed and unstressed plants were detected. transcripts consensually differentially expressed between stress tolerant and susceptible genotypes were identified as belonging to potentially common biological pathways.

RESULTS
experimental design and analysis
the advent of microarrays has enabled the screening of thousands of genes in parallel to assist in candidate gene identification. ideally, one would like to scan the entire genome of a particular plant to obtain a more complete picture of transcriptional changes in response to various stresses. however, whole genome sequences are not available for most crops, leading to a dependence on collections of ests assembled from random cdna libraries. for pulses, a set of chickpea unigenes, grasspea ests and lentil rga sequences were recently employed for the construction of a boutique array enriched with stress-related genes  <cit> . although the two main source of ests for this array were derived from plant tissue challenged with biotic stress , it was clear from annotation of the ests that many may also be associated with abiotic stress [as seen in  <cit> . in fact, a considerable amount of interaction was revealed between wounding, pathogen, abiotic stress and hormonal responses in arabidopsis by transcriptional profiling  <cit> . many genes identified by salt-stress expression studies were reported to be common with pathogen infection  <cit> , whilst a review on abiotic and biotic stress responses in plants  <cit>  concluded that a significant amount of crosstalk exists in the stress signalling networks. therefore, in the absence of a purely abiotic stress related cdna library for chickpea, the boutique pulse array was considered an excellent tool for studying the chickpea transcriptome in response to abiotic stresses.

expression profiling of chickpea in response to the abiotic stresses of drought, cold and high-salinity has not been previously documented. the experimental design of this study was carefully chosen to target adaptive genes, in tolerant and susceptible genotypes, by attempting to simulate natural conditions. this was achieved by cultivating plants in a glasshouse instead of growth chamber, and by applying uniform and prolonged stress before harvesting tissue samples. moreover, it was known that chickpea is most sensitive to drought and cold stresses at flowering  <cit> , thus this study examined both the leaf and flower response for drought and cold stresses. however, considering that plants usually face salinity stress from the vegetative stage , the high-salinity stress was applied in an early growth stage. further, the time-points chosen for tissue collection after high-salinity stress were based on the results of a pilot experiment that showed that two-week old chickpea plants could not prevent salt from reaching leaves after  <dig> h of stress with  <dig> mm nacl .

the microarray experiments were conducted in a reference design, where tissue samples from unstressed plants acted as references against stressed plants. the tolerant and susceptible genotypes were challenged with abiotic stress in a standardized system that minimized experimental variability and ensured accurate measurements of changes in transcript abundance . all expression data was deposited in minimum information about a microarray experiment  compliant format at gene expression omnibus, national center for biotechnology information . the microarray observations were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  for several representative transcripts . eight genes that were commonly de in both the tolerant/susceptible genotypes from all the stresses, time-points and tissue-types were selected for qrt-pcr validation. the comparison of expression values between the two methods revealed similar expression kinetics for all the genes tested indicating reliability of the microarray data. the expression values obtained by qrt-pcr were generally more exaggerated than the corresponding microarray values, which have also been reported in previous studies  <cit> .

* the tolerant/susceptible genotypes used in group i and group ii are mentioned in table  <dig> 

in general, the results showed that the level of several transcripts was altered by more than one of the stresses assessed , which may indicate gene interaction/shared pathways among the biological responses involved in these stress reactions. the number of differentially expressed  transcripts affected in response to high-salinity was much higher than those affected in response to cold and drought stress in all genotypes. in arabidopsis, more transcripts were revealed to be de by drought stress , followed by high-salinity stress  and cold stress  <cit> . however,also in arabidopsis, <cit>  found more transcripts to be de in response to cold stress, followed by high-salinity  and osmotic/drought stress . therefore, we propose that the number of de transcripts in response to a particular stress depends on the method of stress induction and its severity. in this study, the lower number of de transcripts in response to drought stress may be attributed to the nature of drought stress imposed, where pots were allowed to slowly lose water  over a period of  <dig> days. this mimicked drought-stress but was relatively less severe than the cold or high-salinity stress treatments. perhaps more de transcripts may have been identified if the plants were held at 30% pot water content for a longer period. for all treatments, the number of undetected microarray probes  in each chickpea genotype varied according to the source of the probes. in general, the levels of undetected features for l. sativus probes were higher than the c. arietinum probes.

none of the lentil rga probes were detected in any treatment or genotype, possibly due to hybridization interference caused by introns present in these genomic dna probes. similar results were obtained  <cit>  using the same probes for expression profiling of ascochyta blight response in chickpea. the transcripts de in response to drought, cold and high-salinity stresses included those associated with aquaporins, dehydrins, membrane-related proteins, senescence-associated proteins, superoxide dismutases, protein kinases, proline oxidase, trehalose phosphatase, phosphate-induced protein, and ubiquitins that have been previously implicated to be responsive to these stresses  <cit> . considering the large number of de transcripts identified for each stress, only those transcripts thought to be potentially functionally important will be focused upon ' '.

drought stress response
due to the poor quality and yield of rna from root samples, only leaf and flower tissues were used for analysis of drought stress response. six microarrays were hybridized for each of the  <dig> genotype × treatment/control × tissue-type × biological replication conditions, producing  <dig> microarray images for analysis of de transcripts. globally, the number of repressed transcripts was higher than those induced across all the genotypes and tissue types studied . tolerant genotypes shared a similar number of induced transcripts but tolerant- <dig>  had twice the number of repressed transcripts than tolerant- <dig> . the susceptible- <dig>  genotype induced thrice the number of transcripts induced by susceptible- <dig> , but both susceptible genotypes repressed the same number of transcripts. the de transcripts in response to drought stress coded for various functional and regulatory proteins, most of which were repressed. protein and other solute transport was repressed in susceptible- <dig> flowers but induced in tolerant- <dig> flowers. this was evidenced by the induction of a protein-transport facilitation protein  in flowers of tolerant- <dig> and repression of aquaporin-like membrane channel protein  and dna-j like protein involved in intracellular protein transport  in flowers of susceptible- <dig>  two putative auxin-repressed proteins  were highly repressed in flowers and leaves of tolerant- <dig> but were induced in flowers and leaves of susceptible- <dig>  the plant hormone auxin regulates growth and development processes by controlling the expression of auxin-responsive genes, for example, by down-regulating auxin-repressive genes to effect growth  <cit> . subsequently, the down-regulation of this gene in the tolerant genotype and up-regulation in susceptible genotype may indicate that the susceptible genotype had ceased growth due to the drought stress while the tolerant genotype was able to continue normal growth. further, auxin-repressible genes have cis-elements responsive to sucrose in their promoter regions and are regulated by sucrose  <cit> . the sucrose-responsive transcription factor  in this study was induced in the flowers of tolerant- <dig> where the auxin-repressed protein was repressed. therefore, it may be hypothesised that sucrose plays a key role in the drought-stress response of tolerant- <dig> 

defence-related genes including pathogenesis-related proteins , nematode-resistance protein , cf- <dig> gene cluster  and disease resistance response proteins  were repressed in flowers of tolerant and susceptible genotypes. alternatively, pea disease resistance response protein  and a multi-resistance protein abc transporter  were induced in flowers of both tolerant genotypes. disease resistance proteins have been shown to be expressed in response to abiotic stresses  <cit> , but their exact role remains unknown. some genes involved in energy metabolism  were repressed in leaves and flowers of tolerant and susceptible genotypes. the genes involved in photosynthesis were repressed in shoots following the treatment of plants with nacl , peg  or aba. this response is consistent with the closure of stomata in response to high aba or osmotic stress, inhibition of co <dig> fixation, and a reduced need for energy capture by photosynthesis  <cit> . interestingly, two cytosolic fructose  <dig> -bisphosphatase transcripts involved in cellular metabolism were repressed only in flowers of both susceptible genotypes. fructose  <dig> -bisphosphatase is involved in gluconeogenesis and is subject to indirect regulation by atp. when the concentration of atp in the cell is low, amp would then be high which in turn inhibits fructose  <dig> -bisphosphatase and thus gluconeogenesis. subsequently, at low atp concentration the cell does not consume energy for synthesizing glucose. therefore, the susceptible genotypes may be lacking atp as a result of the drought stress. additionally, some transcripts related to senescence, including auxin responsive protein iaa <dig> , senescence-associated protein din  <dig> , and dehydration stress-induced protein  were repressed in leaves and flowers of the tolerant genotypes, which may also be indicative of drought tolerance.

cold stress response
six microarrays were hybridized for each of the  <dig> genotype × treatment/control × tissue-type × biological replication conditions, producing  <dig> microarray images for analysis of de transcripts. the susceptible- <dig>  genotype had the highest number of induced transcripts , whilst tolerant- <dig>  had the highest number of repressed transcripts. the susceptible- <dig> genotype was unique as it showed more induced transcripts than repressed. the number of de transcripts in response to cold stress was approximately double than that observed for drought stress. the de transcripts fell into various functional categories, which indicated a broad response. important transcripts included an auxin-repressed protein  and auxin responsive protein iaa <dig>  that are involved in cell rescue and were induced in flowers and leaves of both susceptible genotypes. the induction of auxin-repressible proteins is known to be negatively correlated with shoot elongation  <cit> , thus this observation may indicate that the growth and development of cold susceptible genotypes was repressed due to the cold-stress. interestingly, two phosphate-induced proteins  were induced in flowers/pods of tolerant- <dig> . phosphorus is important for improved flower formation and seed production, as well as earlier crop maturity  <cit> . this result may imply that the tolerant genotype was able to sustain flowers/pods under cold stress condition.

interestingly, beta-glucosidase  and beta-galactosidase  transcripts were repressed in leaves of both tolerant genotypes. these enzymes are hydrolases that catalyse the reactions associated with hydrolysis of disaccharides  into monosaccharides. therefore, the tolerant genotypes appeared to be retaining disaccharides under cold stress. further, sucrose synthase  was induced in leaves of tolerant- <dig>  which supports an accumulation of sucrose. importantly, the microorganisms escherichia coli and bacillus thuringiensis show increased tolerance to freeze drying in the presence of disaccharides such as sucrose, and it has been proposed that they protect membranes and proteins in intact bacteria while drying  <cit> . potentially, these molecules may perform a similar role in plant cells and provide protection against cold stress. additionally, s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase  transcript was induced in flowers and leaves of susceptible- <dig> and flowers of tolerant- <dig> and is known to be involved in the synthesis of polyamines that act as osmolytes and accumulate under drought/osmotic stress  <cit> .

a gluthatione s-transferase  transcript  was induced in leaves of susceptible- <dig> while another gst  was repressed in leaves of tolerant- <dig>  gst is believed to act as antioxidant enzyme to help scavenge reactive oxygen species during stress  <cit> . in arabidopsis, two gst transcripts were induced and three were repressed in response to drought, cold and salinity  <cit> , which indicates the variable activity of these transcripts under stress perhaps providing an array of functions in the response. almost all the transcripts involved in energy metabolism/photosynthesis were repressed in leaves and flowers of tolerant and susceptible genotypes . this observation is not surprising since low temperature is known to cause reduced enzyme activity, which leads to impairment of photosynthesis and respiration  <cit> . besides these, many transcripts involved in pathogen defence were induced/repressed in leaves and flowers of tolerant and susceptible genotypes . although defence related genes have been shown to be expressed in response to abiotic stresses  <cit> , their actual role still remains unclear. finally, the proteins with unknown and unclear functions that were repressed in leaves and flowers of tolerant and susceptible genotypes need further investigation to confirm their involvement and role in stress response.

high-salinity stress response
six microarrays were hybridized for each of the  <dig> genotype × treatment/control × tissue-type × time-point × biological replication conditions, producing  <dig> microarray images for analysis of de transcripts. the tissues from  <dig> hpt and  <dig> hpt were analysed separately but, overall, the number of transcripts repressed were higher than those induced for all genotypes, tissue types and time points . tolerant- <dig>  had the highest number of repressed transcripts at  <dig> hpt while susceptible- <dig>  and tolerant- <dig>  had the highest number of induced transcripts. at  <dig> hpt, susceptible- <dig> had highest number of induced and repressed transcripts. the number of de transcripts detected for high-salinity stress was much higher than for both cold and drought stresses. transcripts of interest included two poly  binding protein transcripts  that were repressed in roots of both tolerant genotypes at  <dig> hpt, whilst at  <dig> hpt these transcripts were induced in roots and repressed in shoots of susceptible- <dig>  poly  binding proteins are a family of eukaryotic, cytoplasmic proteins thought to bind to the poly  tails of mrnas and play a role in translational regulation  <cit> . in arabidopsis, one rna-binding protein was induced and three rna-binding proteins repressed in response to drought, cold and high-salinity  <cit> . interestingly, a splicing factor-like protein  involved in dna processing was repressed in roots of both tolerant genotypes at  <dig> hpt, and also repressed in shoots and roots of both susceptible genotypes at  <dig> hpt. however, at  <dig> hpt it was repressed only in roots of both susceptible genotypes. subsequently, at  <dig> hpt, rna production/processing may be restricted in roots/shoots of all genotypes but is repressed only in roots of susceptible genotypes at  <dig> hpt.

a putative heat shock protein and heat shock factor binding protein  were repressed in roots and shoots of both tolerant genotypes at  <dig> hpt. on the contrary, the heat shock protein dna-j homolog  was induced in roots of susceptible- <dig> at  <dig> hpt. further, these transcripts were repressed in roots of all tolerant and susceptible genotypes at  <dig> hpt. heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones for protein molecules and play an important role in protein-protein interactions such as folding, assisting in the establishment of proper protein shape and prevention of unwanted protein aggregation. in other plants these proteins are induced by abiotic stresses like drought, cold and high-salinity  <cit> . several of the heat shock proteins studied  <cit>  like, hsp  <dig> and hsp 81- <dig>  were repressed at 10- and 24-hpt after being induced in the first hour, thus the heat-shock proteins in this study may have been induced very early after high-salinity treatment and then repressed at the tissue sampling times. interestingly, a proline oxidase  transcript involved in the conversion of proline to glutamate was repressed only in roots of the susceptible genotypes at  <dig> hpt, and repressed in shoots and roots of susceptible- <dig> and in shoots of tolerant- <dig> at  <dig> hpt. osmolytes such as proline accumulate under salt stress to prevent wilting and toxicity in the presence of high internal salt concentration and possibly aid in stress tolerance  <cit> . these osmolytes usually accumulate if the plants cannot maintain turgor by regulating ion exchange. subsequently, the early repression of proline oxidase in susceptible genotypes may indicate a reaction to osmotic stress through the retention of proline, which was only observed later in one tolerant genotype.

transcripts representing a senescence-associated protein  and senescence associated protein din  <dig>  were repressed in roots of tolerant- <dig> at  <dig> hpt, whilst ripening related protein  was repressed in its shoot at this time. however, dy <dig> was induced in roots of susceptible- <dig> at the same time-point, and dy <dig> was induced in shoots of susceptible- <dig> at  <dig> hpt. these results may indicate that whilst the tolerant- <dig> genotype was avoiding ageing/death related genes, the susceptible- <dig> genotype was already undergoing cell death due to high-salinity stress at  <dig> hpt in roots and  <dig> hpt in shoots. two cytosolic fructose  <dig> -bisphosphatase transcripts  were repressed only in roots of the tolerant genotypes at  <dig> hpt, but dy <dig> was repressed in roots of susceptible genotypes at  <dig> hpt. as described earlier, fructose  <dig> -bisphosphatase is involved in gluconeogenesis and is under indirect regulation of atp. thus, the roots of tolerant genotypes may be conserving energy by repressing this enzyme as early at  <dig> hpt, while this did not occur in the susceptible genotypes until  <dig> hpt, which may contribute to susceptibility.

among the defence-related transcripts, caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase  <dig> , which is associated with lignification  <cit> , was repressed in shoots and roots of both susceptible genotypes at  <dig> hpt, and repressed only in shoots of susceptible- <dig> at  <dig> hpt. lignin biosynthesis is related to the reinforcement of the plant cell wall in the response to wounding or pathogen challenge. on the other hand, a putative glycine-rich cell wall protein grp  <dig>   was repressed only in the roots of the tolerant genotypes at  <dig> hpt. grps are also closely associated with lignification of cell walls in response to wounding or pathogen attack  <cit> . thus, the repression of genes related to lignification in both susceptible and tolerant genotypes may indicate the direction of cellular resources toward other processes. interestingly, several pathogenesis related protein 4a transcripts  were induced in the roots of all tolerant and susceptible genotypes at  <dig> hpt, and again at in all genotypes except susceptible- <dig> at  <dig> hpt. plant defence related genes have been known to be induced in response to abiotic stresses  <cit> . in fact, many genes identified in expression studies in response to salt stress include those in common with pathogen infection  <cit> . considering that pathogenesis related protein 4a transcripts were highly induced only in response to high-salinity stress in this study, further investigation of their involvement in salt stress may be warranted.

an interesting pattern was observed amongst the transcripts related to signalling and communication. a putative histidine-containing phospho-transfer protein athp <dig>  and a protein kinase  were repressed only in roots of both tolerant genotypes at  <dig> hpt, whilst athp <dig> was repressed only in roots of tolerant- <dig> and protein kinase was repressed in shoots of tolerant- <dig> at  <dig> hpt. the athps  are thought to be involved in stress sensing and relay signal transduction, where athp <dig> is thought to sense osmotic stress and transfer the signal via athp2/athp <dig> to the arabidopsis response regulators   <cit> . the protein kinases are also thought to be involved in various signalling cascades related to stress responses  <cit> . thus, the repression of these signalling molecules only in tolerant genotypes may have significance and needs further investigation. putative auxin-repressed proteins  were induced in roots of tolerant- <dig>  tolerant- <dig> and susceptible- <dig> whilst they were repressed in shoots of tolerant- <dig> and susceptible- <dig> at  <dig> hpt. auxin regulates growth and development and the induction of auxin-repressible proteins is negatively correlated with shoot elongation  <cit> . this observation suggests that the roots of all genotypes ceased to develop  <dig> hpt but the shoots were still undergoing growth, which supports the hypothesis that genes regulating cell division and elongation might be affected by salt stress  <cit> .

transcripts associated with transport facilitation like aquaporin  and aquaporin-like transmembrane protein  were repressed in roots of the tolerant genotypes at  <dig> hpt. also, aquaporin  <dig> , aquaporin membrane protein  and aquaporin-like transmembrane channel protein  were repressed in roots of susceptible- <dig> at  <dig> hpt. at the same time only dy <dig> was repressed in roots of tolerant- <dig>  changes in expression of aquaporins  are common to other salt stress studies and may be due to shrinkage of cells and organelles after osmotic stress  <cit> . finally, many genes with unknown/unclear functions were induced/repressed in shoots and roots of all the genotypes and most of the transcripts associated with energy metabolism were repressed in all genotypes and conditions.

consensus stress-responsive transcripts
the main objective of this study was to identify transcripts that were consistently de between tolerant and susceptible genotypes for each stress. our hypothesis was that if a putative gene was consistently expressed only in tolerant or susceptible genotypes for a particular stress, it might be a candidate for tolerance/susceptibility to the stress. of the  <dig> de transcripts expressed in drought tolerant and susceptible genotypes, only two were consistently expressed . these included a cytosolic fructose  <dig> -bisphosphatase  and a gene with unknown function, which were repressed in flowers of both susceptible genotypes. fructose  <dig> -bisphosphatase is repressed when cellular atp levels are low to conserve energy, which may be an effect of drought susceptibility. the involvement and role of genes with unknown function have to be confirmed by additional studies.

* the tolerant/susceptible genotypes used in group i and group ii are mentioned in table  <dig> 

fifteen out of the  <dig> de transcripts found in cold tolerant and susceptible genotypes were consistently expressed , all of which were repressed. most of the putative genes were identified in leaves of the tolerant genotypes, and included a beta-galactosidase  transcript that was described earlier as possibly indicative of disaccharide  retention with the effect of protecting cell membranes during cold stress. several protein synthesis/modification and energy/metabolism transcripts were also repressed , which was likely due to the impairment of photosynthesis and respiration at low temperature  <cit> . other consistently repressed transcripts in tolerant genotypes included putative signalling  and defence-related proteins , which may be involved in the repression of cell death mechanisms. in susceptible genotypes, a putative superoxide dismutase precursor protein  and sorting nexin protein  were the only known transcripts to be consistently repressed. superoxide dismutase is involved in the programmed cell death pathway where its repression allows the accumulation of reactive oxygen species that signal and contribute to cell death  <cit> . subsequently, this result suggests that cold stress in susceptible genotypes may lead to the promotion of cell death pathways.

of the transcripts consistently expressed in tolerant genotypes in response to high-salinity stress, the annotation of transcripts at  <dig> hpt suggest a reduction in energy production in shoots and roots by repression of putative genes including p <dig> chlorophyll a-apoprotein  and nadh-plastoquinone oxidoreductase subunit i , cytosolic fructose  <dig> -bisphosphatase  and splicing factor-like protein . these observations may indicate that the available cellular resources have instead been deployed to maintain the ionic balance needed to tolerate the high-salinity conditions. the athp <dig>  and protein kinase  are potentially involved in signalling cascades responsible for sensing and relaying osmotic stress signals, but their consistent repression in tolerant genotypes suggest that they may negatively regulate the genes responsible for signalling high-salinity tolerance. additionally a glycine rich protein  that is associated with lignification of cell walls in response to wounding and pathogen attack was repressed in tolerant genotypes, which indicates that a reduction of lignin deposition may be an effect of high-salinity tolerance. in tolerant genotypes at  <dig> hpt, two energy and metabolic-related transcripts were consistently repressed, including a carbonic anhydrase  and putative thiazole biosynthetic enzyme  in roots, suggesting again the sacrifice of general cellular functions for maintenance of ionic balance. in shoots, only a pathogenesis-related protein  was consistently repressed at  <dig> hpt, but a similar transcript  was induced in roots of tolerant genotypes at the same time. as described earlier, pr proteins have been shown to be expressed under abiotic stresses but their role is not very well understood. subsequently, these putative defence-related proteins may have a tissue-specific role in conferring high-salinity tolerance in chickpea.

only two transcripts were de in susceptible genotypes at  <dig> hpt, all occurring in root tissue. one of these was gene with unclear function and the other a proline oxidase transcript  that may indicate the retention of proline, which is an osmolyte known to accumulate under osmotic stresses and plays a role in stabilizing structure of plant proteins  <cit> . at  <dig> hpt, a putative splicing factor-like protein  was consistently repressed in roots of susceptible genotypes, suggesting the potential stress-related repression of rna production/processing. interestingly, a putative xylosidase  was induced in susceptible roots at  <dig> hpt. xylosidase exhibits hydrolytic activity towards polysaccharides and is responsible for structural changes by degradation of polysaccharides to allow the modification of the cell wall  <cit> . thus, this result shows that susceptible genotypes may undergo cell wall degradation as a result of high-salinity stress. finally, several unknown/unclear transcripts were de in both tolerant and susceptible genotypes. of interest were two unknowns  that were consistently induced in tolerant genotypes and may be important for high-salinity tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
this study revealed that  <dig> transcripts were de in all stresses, genotypes, tissue-types, and time points tested. the large number of transcriptome changes observed highlights the difficulty of understanding the global context of stress responses. in arabidopsis, approximately 30% of the genome was potentially regulated by salt, cold and osmotic stress  <cit> . in our study it was also observed that the number of transcripts expressed depended on the type and severity of stress, where more transcripts were expressed under high-salinity followed by cold and drought stress. the de transcripts between the stressed and unstressed plants were classified in relation to functional categories and, overall, more genes were found to be repressed than induced. the genes that were consistently de in groups of tolerant and susceptible genotypes for each stress were compiled and interesting observations were made when the de genes were analysed with respect to their biological role in plants.

the main objective of this study was to identify a suite of putative genes that were consistently expressed in tolerant or susceptible genotypes for each stress condition. to our knowledge, this is the first intensive cdna microarray study for abiotic stress responses in chickpea. several candidate genes for tolerance/susceptibility were identified from table  <dig>  but it is crucial to emphasize that changes in mrna accumulation may not necessarily correlate with protein/enzyme activity levels  <cit> . moreover, when applying stress treatments, the response in the plant may be variable due to the nature of treatment, variation in response by plants, or natural variation between plants  <cit> . therefore, it may possibly be ideal to compare expression profiles of recombinant inbred lines  or near isogenic lines  that are tolerant and susceptible to these abiotic stresses to reduce background genetic variation amongst the plants. the expression profiles provide starting points for in-depth studies on candidate genes to help prioritize the intensive task of using reverse genetics to assign gene functions  <cit> . the results of this study should therefore be carefully extrapolated until further in-depth studies have been carried out. nevertheless, the annotation of transcripts with significant fold change and detection of consistently de transcripts between tolerant and susceptible genotypes strongly suggests that these putative genes have a role in abiotic stress responses. subsequently, the experimental set-up and downstream analysis methods applied in this study are appropriate for identification of putative stress induced transcripts in chickpea. the identification of novel genes, determination of their expression patterns in response to different stress conditions, and an improved understanding of their functions in stress adaptation will provide basic knowledge to design effective engineering strategies for enhancement of stress tolerances.
