BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei is a soil dwelling gram-negative bacterium and the cause of melioidosis, a serious human infection commonly reported in northeast thailand and northern australia  <cit> . the genome of this biothreat agent contains genomic island  regions that have properties indicative of horizontal gene transfer, i.e. dna displaying anomalies in % g+c content or dinucleotide frequency signature, and/or the presence of coding sequences  with similarities to genes associated with mobile genetic elements such as insertion sequence  elements, bacteriophages and plasmids. sixteen gis were identified in the genome of b. pseudomallei strain k <dig>  <cit> , comprising approximately 6% of the genome. screening of  <dig> clinical and environmental isolates of b. pseudomallei for the presence of selected k <dig> gis found that there was variable distribution  <cit> , suggesting that horizontal gene transfer contributes to genome diversity. genomic islands in other bacterial species encode many different functions, and selection may favour the maintenance of islands that increase fitness in a specialized environmental niche. genomic islands also play a pivotal role in virulence of a large number of bacterial pathogens, carrying clusters of virulence genes encoding a wide range of functions including iron uptake systems, adhesins, superantigens, and genes that alter the antibiotic resistance phenotype  <cit> .

b. pseudomallei is found in the soil and surface water of endemic areas and usually enters the host via cuts and abrasions in the skin or by inhalation following contact with contaminated water or soil. once inside the body, the time taken for disease symptoms to appear can vary from hours to years. in some cases, b. pseudomallei infection does not cause overt disease around the time of exposure, but rather results in a state of bacterial dormancy in the host for many years before causing disease in later life. the most remarkable example is that of a second world war veteran who developed melioidosis  <dig> years after returning to the us from se asia  <cit> .

the clinical symptoms of melioidosis are so varied that the disease has been termed "the great mimicker"  <cit> . disease manifestations are extremely wide ranging and vary from acute, fulminant sepsis to localized disease. the most frequent picture is a septicemic illness, often associated with bacterial dissemination to distant sites such as the liver and spleen  <cit> . pneumonia occurs in around 50% of patients. other sites of infection include bone, joints, skin, soft tissue, prostate and the central nervous system. overall mortality is around 50% in northeast thailand   <cit> , and 19% in australia  <cit> . the basis for marked variability in clinical presentation and disease severity is unknown. host determinants such as diabetes mellitus and renal failure represent risk factors for infection with b. pseudomallei  <cit> , but no host factors have been associated with specific clinical features. the role of bacterial factors in determining disease variability and severity is poorly understood.

in this study we examined the distribution of a representative sample of five gis previously described for b. pseudomallei k <dig>  in silico analysis of  <dig> genome sequences revealed the micro-evolutionary processes responsible for the short-term diversification of these regions. multiplex pcr screening was used to investigate gi presence in b. pseudomallei isolates from ne thailand. rapid loss and/or acquisition of gene islands was observed by assaying the presence of islands within isolates belonging to single clones )  <cit> . comparisons were drawn between isolates obtained from the environment and from patients with melioidosis in order to examine the role of genomic islands in virulence.

RESULTS
overview of five genomic islands in b. pseudomallei strain k96243
the five genomic islands studied here include examples of a prophage  which has been shown to be mobile in this strain, two prophage-like islands , a putative integrated plasmid , and a putative metabolic island  that lacks any obvious genes for mobilisation or integration  <cit> . the five islands are a representative sample of the islands present in a single strain, and provide a snapshot of gi diversity. the mosaic structure and variable composition of gis means that it is impractical to attempt to capture the full gamut of elements circulating in a large natural bacterial population, and we therefore focused our analysis on a representative sample of gis identified in k <dig> 

a summary of the cds content of each of the five gis in b. pseudomallei k <dig> is provided in additional file  <dig>  and a comprehensive list of the cdss contained in these regions is provided in additional file  <dig>  the overwhelming majority of cdss that are not phage or plasmid related are of unknown function. gis  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contain cdss with no homology to known metabolic or putative virulence proteins. gis  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contain low % gc regions relative to the rest of the island, indicating that the islands are mosaic and some genes may have been acquired recently; new gene acquisitions may have atypical sequence characteristics that are maintained over a relatively short time frame. gi  <dig> contains several cdss with similarity to known virulence determinants, including a putative haemagglutinin and processing protein, and genes involved in the acquisition and utilization of nutrients. the abundance of cdss on this island that encode functions that potentially broaden the metabolic repertoire of k <dig> , has led to this island being previously designated a putative metabolic island  <cit> . cdss in this island region exhibited varying levels of similarity to proteins from a range of taxonomically diverse organisms, and it was not possible to speculate on the likely source of this island region from similarity searches.

comparative genomic analysis of genomic islands
in silico analysis of the five gis was undertaken to explore the degree of variability in presence, structure and chromosomal insertion site. nine isolates that have been sequenced or are currently undergoing whole genome sequencing by jcvi  were examined and compared with strain k <dig>  which has been sequenced by the wellcome trust sanger institute  <cit>  . seven jcvi isolates and k <dig> are unique strains, but strains 1106b and 1710b were recovered from patients presenting with recurrent melioidosis due to relapse , and are identical by pfge and mlst to strains 1106a and 1710a, respectively.

† strain pairs 1106a & 1106b, and 1710a and 1710b were obtained from two patients who each relapsed   <dig> years after the primary episode of melioidosis. 'a' denotes primary isolate and 'b' denotes relapse isolate.

- island absent; + island present; +/- island partially present ; -* island absent at the site of insertion but similar region present elsewhere in the genome; +* island present and contains extra sequence; alt alternative island present at this site 

we examined the structure, composition and insertion site of the five gis using the ten available genome sequences . gis  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all had flanking repeats, integrases, and mobile element-like genes, consistent with the suggestion that these were recently acquired mobile genetic elements. there were two instances where the gi was absent at the predicted site of insertion, but dna with extended similarity to the island was detected elsewhere in the genome . in b. pseudomallei strain  <dig> a prophage with extended similarity to gi  <dig> , is integrated at an alternative trna gene on chromosome  <dig> . in the genome of k <dig>  gi  <dig> is found at this alternative locus. in 1106a an island with similarity to gi  <dig> is inserted at an alternative locus  on chromosome  <dig>  an identical island is present in 1106b. the 1106a island has a mosaic structure; approximately half of the island is highly similar  to the k <dig> gi  <dig>  with the other half exhibiting no similarity . the location of these sequences at alternative loci may be due to genomic rearrangement following divergence from a common ancestor carrying the island, or may reflect the presence of multiple insertion sites for related mobile genetic elements in the b. pseudomallei genome.

comparative analysis of gi  <dig> region identified an alternative island inserted at orthologous sites in the 1106a and 1106b genomes . this novel island is larger than the k <dig> gi  <dig> . comparison of the islands in 1106a and 1106b demonstrated that they are virtually identical except for a small internal indel region that is present in 1106a but absent in 1106b. the indel region is between two identical is elements in 1106a. in 1106b there is a single insertion sequence  element, suggesting that recombination between the is elements may have led to the deletion in this region in 1106b. although the 1106a and 1106b islands appear to be inserted at the same site as the k <dig> gi  <dig>  the attachment sites are different. in the case of k <dig>  the attachment site is an ala trna, generating  <dig> mer perfect repeats that flank the island. the gi  <dig> regions in 1106a and 1106b are next to the ala trna, but the flanking dna in both islands is a  <dig> mer sequence that does not appear to be part of the ala trna, or surrounding sequence in k <dig>  the alternative gi  <dig> in 1106a and 1106b contains a putative filamentous haemagglutinin and processing protein that are similar to proteins found in b. thailandensis . the homologues of the filamentous haemagglutinin and processing protein in b. thailandensis strain e <dig> are not in an orthologous position relative to the b. pseudomallei gi  <dig> flanking dna. in the genome of this closely related species, an alternative gi  <dig> is present , which is integrated at the orthologous attachment site  to the gi  <dig> in b. pseudomallei k <dig> 

micro-evolutionary diversification was also observed in gi  <dig>  in which an internal deletion encompassing cdss bpss <dig> to bpss <dig> was noted in four unique strains and both relapse isolates . strain 406e also contains the island, but has a deletion encompassing the same region  that has different boundaries, suggesting that the deletion occurred independently in this strain. one other strain  contained the complete gi  <dig> plus additional sequence, both within the island and downstream of it. figure  <dig> shows a comparison of gi  <dig> regions in strains k <dig>   <dig> and 1710b . the lack of integrases and other mobile genetic element cdss, and high variability in cds content, suggests that gi  <dig> is distinct from the other gis considered here which have structures more typical of mobile genetic elements. gi  <dig> has a mosaic structure consistent with a long history of multiple insertion and deletion events. the role of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of this region is supported by the anomalous gc composition .

presence of five genomic islands in b. pseudomallei
by assaying the presence of gis in a large strain collection within the population framework provided by mlst data, it is possible to investigate the frequency of island acquisition and loss, as well as their possible role in disease. presence or absence of the five gis was defined for  <dig> thai isolates obtained from the environment  and from patients with melioidosis . the proportion of all isolates positive by pcr varied between gis, and ranged from 12% for a prophage-like island  to 76% for a metabolic island  . these proportions are consistent with previous findings reported for  <dig> thai isolates  <cit> , with the exception that gi  <dig> and gi  <dig> were detected more frequently in the larger bacterial population examined here . isolates in both collections were from northeast thailand. a small proportion of strains were positive for one or two gene targets for a given gi, and gave an amplification product for pcr across the putative insertion site . one explanation for this is that gis may have alternative insertion sites. this explanation was shown to be true for some islands on the comparative genomic analysis of the sequenced strains, described above.

variability in genomic islands between clones of b. pseudomallei
we explored the mobility of the five gis by examining whether the presence of islands reflects the underlying population structure, such that closely related isolates might have more similar gi repertoires than distantly related isolates. this was possible as all of the isolates used in this study had been characterized previously by mlst  <cit> . analysis was restricted to the three largest clones  3-4-11-3-5-4-6), st  <dig> , and st  <dig> ). variation in the gi repertoire was defined within and between these clones. there was considerable variability in presence of the five gis between the three clones . for example, gi  <dig> was more common in isolates belonging to st  <dig> than the other two clones , gi  <dig> was ubiquitous in st  <dig> isolates but present in three quarters or less of the other two sts , and gi  <dig> was only detected in  <dig> isolates belonging to st  <dig>  an analysis of the difference in gis between environmental and clinical isolates in each clone was not performed because of the lack of statistical power.

a fisher's exact test

these findings suggest that horizontal gene transfer can alter the gene repertoire  of this species very rapidly, i.e. before any observable changes in the vertically inherited "core" genome, and is consistent with the hypothesis that isolates that are identical by mlst might exploit different ecological niches  <cit> . the mlst data for b. pseudomallei has revealed a very high frequency of homologous recombination resulting in limited clustering and low levels of linkage disequilibrium  <cit> . our results also suggest that the loss and acquisition of genomic islands by horizontal gene transfer significantly contributes to the dynamism of the genome. however, it should be noted that these two processes are distinct, and that a high rate of island transfer does not necessarily predict a high rate of homologous recombination or vice versa. for example, mlst data for the gram-positive pathogen staphylococcus aureus has revealed only modest rates of homologous recombination, yet the "accessory" genome of this species is known to change very rapidly  <cit> . b. pseudomallei represents an alternative scenario, the data indicating both high rates of homologous recombination together with rapid changes in gi repertoire.

comparison of the presence of genomic islands in soil and invasive isolates
we examined the hypothesis that the gis play a role in the ability to cause human disease by testing whether the presence of gis was significantly different in clinical and environmental isolates. we found that there was no significant difference in the presence of any of the gis between these two groups  . we considered the possibility that combinations of gis could alter the ability to cause disease through either a cumulative or synergistic effect. we defined the cumulative number of gis per isolate for the  <dig> thai isolates; this ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  . the distribution of cumulative gi number did not differ between environmental and disease-associated isolates  . these data indicate that none of the islands examined were numerically associated either individually or on a cumulative basis with the ability to cause melioidosis.

relationship between clinical features and genomic islands in disease-associated isolates
the lack of association between the presence of the five gis and the ability to cause human disease does not exclude the possibility that these gis are associated with specific clinical features or outcome. to study this, we undertook a detailed statistical analysis of the relationship between a range of clinical features in  <dig> patients with melioidosis and the presence of gis in their associated b. pseudomallei isolates. univariate analysis was used to compare the presence of each gi and their cumulative number with the presence of blood cultures positive for b. pseudomallei, presence of ultrasound confirmed abscess in liver and/or spleen, pneumonia, multiple organ involvement, the presence on admission or subsequent development of hypotension, impaired renal function, impaired liver function and death during hospital admission. gi  <dig> was negatively associated with positive blood culture , and gi  <dig> was negatively associated with impaired renal function . cumulative number of gis was negatively associated with impaired renal function . these significant associations could be a chance finding related to multiple comparisons. to test this hypothesis, the presence of gis were determined for an independent set of  <dig> invasive isolates obtained from patients with melioidosis presenting to sappasithiprasong hospital between 2002– <dig>  there was no significant association between gi  <dig> and positive blood cultures , or gi  <dig> and impaired renal function . cumulative number of gis was not negatively associated with impaired renal function. we conclude that there were no significant associations between clinical features and any of the five gis examined.

CONCLUSIONS
this survey of divergent putative gis in a well-defined and clinically significant b. pseudomallei population has demonstrated that genetic exchange is widespread. our in silico analysis provided evidence that gi  <dig> may represent a composite region rather than a genomic island, and defined a novel gi at the predicted insertion site for gi  <dig>  a detailed analysis of the relationship between five gis and both the ability to cause disease and a range of clinical features failed to show an association between the two. however, a previous study that utilized mlst to examine the bacterial genotype of  <dig> b. pseudomallei isolates  obtained from northeast thailand reported that isolates from patients with melioidosis were significantly over-represented in the  <dig> largest clones  <cit> . a classification index applied to examine differences in the frequency of sts, and the frequency of alleles at specific loci, also demonstrated a significant difference between the two bacterial populations. this indicates that bacterial genotypes were not distributed randomly between soil and invasive isolate groups, an observation that could be accounted for by variations in the accessory genome of some strains that leads to heightened virulence. further evidence for this suggestion comes from a study in australia, in which variability in genome content between two australian b. pseudomallei isolates was utilized to define sequence variability and to develop a variable amplicon typing scheme designed to score the presence of  <dig> pcr amplicons in thai and australian isolates  <cit> . isolates clustered into groups, one of which was mostly associated with severe disease.

our study confirms the utility of a range of approaches in defining the presence and significance of genomic variation in natural populations of b. pseudomallei. further studies are required to determine the full extent of variability in gis, and their relationship to biological fitness in the environment and to disease pathogenesis in the human host.
