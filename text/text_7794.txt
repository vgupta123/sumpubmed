BACKGROUND
vertebrate gastrulation depends upon exquisite regulation of diverse morphogenetic processes including changes in cell shape, cellular adhesion and migration. for example, in xenopus laevis coordinated changes in cell shape and motility guide the initial formation of the dorsal lip, the initial site of mesodermal involution  <cit> . later, the completion of involution of prospective mesodermal cells is strongly influenced by biomechanical forces generated by convergent extension of dorsal mesodermal cells  <cit> . convergent extension involves mediolateral elongation of trunk mesoderm cells, followed by medially-converging intercalation. while convergent extension of dorsal mesoderm is a major driving force for the extension and completion of involution movements, epiboly of the non-involuting ectoderm  is also necessary for efficient gastrulation  <cit> . the coordinated changes in cell shape and cell migration associated with gastrulation are influenced by diverse processes, including large-scale remodeling of cytoskeletal architecture and precise modulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix associations.

the molecular basis for initiating and regulating the complex cellular movements of vertebrate gastrulation is only beginning to be discerned. recent work has shown wnt proteins as key upstream regulators in gastrulation movements. in xenopus laevis and zebrafish, non-canonical wnt signaling on the dorsal side of developing embryos directly initiates the cellular rearrangements and migration that contribute to convergent extension of involuting mesoderm  <cit> . other wnt-mediated signals activate a distinct protein kinase c-dependent signaling pathway, which appears to affect cdc <dig> signaling and to provide cues that maintain tissue separation during gastrulation  <cit> . inactivation of this pkc-dependent pathway causes ineffective separation of involuting mesoderm from overlying ectoderm in xenopus, resulting in severe gastrulation defects  <cit> . as with the planar cell polarity  pathway in drosophila  <cit> , vertebrate wnt signals during gastrulation can involve signaling through the strabismus and jnk  proteins  <cit> , and affect cellular morphology and migratory behaviors through the activities of a diversity of rho family gtpases  <cit> .

experiments perturbing the activity of rho gtpases have suggested important regulatory roles for these proteins during gastrulation in xenopus  <cit> . upon activation, rho gtpases are known to interact with a variety of downstream effector proteins which in turn mediate changes in actin and microtubule cytoskeletal architecture  <cit> , cell adhesion  <cit> , cell migratory behaviours  <cit> , vesicular transport  <cit>  and signalling  <cit> . regulation of the coordinated cellular and tissue level processes involved in gastrulation appears to involve multiple rho gtpases  and multiple downstream effector proteins. however, we are only currently beginning to discern the identities and functions of the repertoire of effector proteins that specifically relay rho gtpase signals involved in the initiation and coordination of gastrulation movements.

regulation of cell-cell adhesion is thought to be of particular importance during gastrulation movements in xenopus, when the integrity of the elongating mesodermal sheet must be maintained at the same time that major cellular rearrangements are occuring. downregulation of c-cadherin-mediated cellular adhesion has been observed to correlate with convergent extension movements of mesodermal cells  <cit> . this change in c-cadherin mediated adhesion between blastomeres occurs with no detectable change in cell surface expression of the c-cadherin protein. while the precise mechanism of regulation in this developmental context remains unclear, it is known that lateral clustering of cadherins  is capable of strengthening adhesive function  <cit> . in addition, it is also known that rho gtpases can act through the iqgap protein to regulate cadherin-mediated adhesion  <cit> . recent chararacterization of the developmental pattern of iqgap expression in xenopus embryos suggests that analogous upstream regulatory mechanisms may operate during xenopus gastrulation  <cit> .

in this study, the embryonic expression pattern and function of a xenopus gene encoding a member of the recently characterized cep/borg family of rhogtpase effector proteins  <cit>  is explored. these proteins have been shown to have distinct effects on cytoskeletal architecture, cellular morphology, adhesion and migratory behaviours  <cit> , and have also been shown to regulate septin function during cytokinesis  <cit> .

xenopus cdc <dig> effector protein  <dig>  hereafter referred to as xcep <dig>  is shown here to be developmentally regulated during early embryonic stages, with diffuse expression of mrna in the animal region that diminishes during late gastrula to neurula stages. experiments employing morpholino-mediated inhibition of translation suggest that expression of this protein is essential for normal gastrulation movements, and that its activity is required for maintenance of cell-cell adhesion between blastomeres of animal cap explants.

RESULTS
xenopus laevis cdc <dig> effector protein  <dig>  is present in two allelic forms, and its expression is developmentally regulated during early embryogenesis
a differential display approach was employed to reveal genes that are developmentally regulated during the transition from blastula to neurula. this screen allowed for the isolation of numerous cdna fragments corresponding to differentially regulated mrnas present in the xenopus embryo. the sequence of one of these fragments was found to be highly homologous to the translational start site region of database cdna sequences encoding cdc <dig> effector protein  <dig>  a full length cdna corresponding to our isolated fragment was amplified using 3' race pcr, cloned and sequenced. an alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence for our isolated full length cdna sequence with human  <cit>  and xenopus  cep2/borg <dig> genes from genbank revealed significant homology , particularly within and immediately surrounding the conserved crib, ci and cii domains  <cit> . when comparing the two xenopus sequences, there were a significant number of positions where the amino acid sequence derived from our isolated cdna sequence differed from that found in the genbank sequence . these differences were found to occur almost exclusively in regions of the protein outside the three conserved domains  that define the cep family of effector proteins. given the allotetraploid genetic ancestry of xenopus laevis, and the degree of similarity between the sequences, it is likely that these two sequences constitute pseudoalleles of the same gene. we choose to refer to our isolated pseudoallele as xcep2a and the database allele as xcep2b.

semi-quantitative rt-pcr was conducted on staged rna samples using primers specific to the 5' untranslated sequence of the isolated xcep2a cdna. this analysis revealed the presence of maternally-derived xcep2a mrna prior to the onset of zygotic transcription , maintenance of this expression level through mid-gastrula stages, with a downregulation of mrna expression starting at stage  <dig>  and becoming more marked by stage  <dig>  . rt-pcr analysis of the expression of the other pseudoallele  revealed an expression pattern similar to xcep2a , with an almost complete loss of detectable expression by stage  <dig> . both patterns correspond to that observed for the amplified fragments originally isolated from the original differential display gels . in situ hybridization revealed that xcep2a mrna  is distributed uniformly over the animal hemisphere of the embryo at blastula and early gastrula stages , with an animal to vegetal gradient in staining evident . over time, there is a diminution of the intensity but no change in the general expression pattern as the embryo transitions from blastula to gastrula stages .

morpholino oligonucleotides directed against xcep <dig> cause gastrulation defects
in order to assess the functional role of xcep <dig> in early embryogenesis, microinjections were conducted with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, mo <dig> and mo <dig> directed to the translational start site region of one or both of the two xcep <dig> pseudoalleles. mo <dig> is targetted to xcep2a, and mo <dig> is targetted to the xcep2b sequence found in the genbank database. for this experiment, a total of  <dig> ng of morpholino oligonucleotide was injected into the animal region of one-cell embryos. at time points just prior to blastopore closure , mo <dig> antisense oligonucleotides pseudoalleles elicited significant gastrulation delay as compared to an identical dose of control morpholino oligonucleotide . a comparison of the effects of each morpholino, and the combined effects of co-injection of both morpholinos is shown in figure 4b. the severity of gastrulation delay was quantified at late gastrulation by comparing the ratio of blastopore diameter to embryo diameter in antisense-injected, control injected and non-injected embryos. the mean ratio, and the distribution of ratios differed significantly between control injected and antisense morpholino injected groups . mo <dig> was slightly less effective than mo <dig> in producing gastrulation delay. small differences between the effects of the various injection conditions suggest that either the mo <dig> morpholino is less efficient at translational inhibition, or that the pseudoallele targeted by mo <dig> may be expressed at comparatively lower levels. the combined mo1+mo <dig> condition did not produce more severe defects than the individual morpholino injections, perhaps because the dose of each morpholino in the combined condition was half that in either of the single morpholino conditions . many of the more severely affected embryos at this dose did not complete blastopore closure, and showed lethal defects that precluded normal neurulation. embryos that survived treatments of between  <dig> and  <dig> ng of antisense morpholino  were found to have phenotypes consistent with gastrulation defects, including significant shortening of the ap axis and multiple instances of spina bifida . the phenotypes we observe share significant similarity to defects caused by specific inhibition of convergent extension in mesoderm  <cit> . at a higher dose , embryonic lethality was observed consistently in practically all treated embryos prior to neurulation .

the antisense morpholino oligonucleotides used in these studies were found to elicit specific translational inhibition of xcep <dig>  injection of antisense morpholino against our isolated pseudoallele resulted in largescale inhibition of translation of a myc-tagged fusion protein from co-injected mrna . a modified mrna  encoding a c-terminal myc tagged xcep2a fusion protein, with seven point mutations in the 5' untranslated region and at the 3rd base of selected codons in the translated region , was found to be insensitive to inhibition by antisense morpholino oligonucleotide mo <dig> , demonstrating sequence specificity of the translational inhibition effect. xcep2a* myc migrates as a doublet, which probably arises due to inefficient translational initiation at the true start codon of the mutated mrna and some initiation at the second aug codon, encoding methionine at position  <dig> . while mo <dig> does not inhibit translation from the multiply mutated xcep2a* myc mrna, we did find that mo <dig>  which is designed to be complementary to the database pseudoallele, was capable of significantly reducing translation from mrna corresponding to our isolated pseudoallele . this suggests that under these conditions, the two-nucleotide mismatch between mo <dig> and our xcep2a-myc mrna does not preclude translational inhibition . given this observation, it is possible that injection of either antisense xcep <dig> morpholino significantly reduces the endogenous expression of both pseudoalleles. in addition to the dosage issue in the combined condition , cross-inhibition of this type could contribute to the observed lack of additive effects in the combined mo <dig> + mo <dig> condition.

the blastopore closure delay phenotype observed in antisense morpholino injected embryos could be completely rescued by co-injection with  <dig>  ng of the xcep2a*mrna, which is insensitive to translational inhibition . this result suggests that the observed effects of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides on gastrulation are not due to inhibition of a non-xcep <dig> gene product, or to non-specific toxicity of the antisense oligonucleotides. this observation strongly suggests that the observed effects of the antisense oligonucleotides on embryogenesis are attributable to a specific knockdown of translation of the endogenous xcep <dig> mrna, and a concomitant reduction in xcep <dig> protein.

in contrast to the morpholino knockdown effects, overexpression of xcep <dig> in embryos by injection of up to  <dig> ng xcep <dig> mrna was found to result in no detectable abnormalities in embryonic development . the absence of effects may not be unexpected, given current models of rhogtpase effector protein activation. rhogtpase effector proteins are activated by direct binding to gtp-bound rhogtpases. as such, the number of activated rhogtpase molecules may constrain the number of effector proteins bound and activated, regardless of the heightened expression levels of the effector protein.

xcep <dig> morpholinos do not interfere with mesoderm induction
the observed effects of antisense xcep <dig> morpholinos in xenopus embryos suggests that xcep <dig> may play a direct role in directing the morphogenetic movements of gastrulation. this interpretation would be consistent with the limited characterization that have thus far been conducted on functional properties of this class of proteins  <cit> . however, it is also conceivable that xcep <dig> antisense morpholinos may indirectly inhibit gastrulation by interfering with mesodermal induction. in order to assess this possibility, the level of expression of the pan-mesodermal marker, brachyury, and the dorsal mesodermal marker, goosecoid, was assessed in control and antisense morpholino injected embryos at gastrula stage using semi-quantitative rt-pcr . expression of mesodermal markers was similar in non-injected, control morpholino injected and antisense xcep <dig> injected embryos, suggesting that it is the behavior of mesodermal cells during gastrulation  that is affected by xcep <dig> antisense morpholino oligonucleotides.

xcep <dig> morpholinos interfere with cell-cell adhesion in animal cap explants
in order to assess the mechanism by which xcep <dig> influences gastrulation, the effects of xcep <dig> morpholinos on cultured animal cap explants were evaluated. while the initial intent of these experiments was to discern whether xcep <dig> morpholinos prevented normal activin-induced convergent extension of animal caps, it soon became clear that morpholino-treated explants had a more fundamental deficiency. within a  <dig> hour period, animal cap explants derived from xcep <dig> antisense morpholino  -injected embryos were found to completely lose their integrity , collapsing into piles of dissociated cells. this contrasts with control injected and non-injected caps, which remained tightly associated at  <dig> hours . this result was evident with or without activin treatment . the observed defect in xcep <dig> mo <dig> treated caps suggested a loss of cell-cell adhesion, as cells of disintegrated explants appeared to be completely dissociated, with few if any adherent clusters of cells. the observed loss of integrity followed a reproducible pattern. at approximately  <dig> hours after explantation, dissociated cells from the interior of the explant could often be observed discharging from the healed wound site , causing the explants to become progressively reduced in size. the cells of the outer pigmented epithelium of the explant remained adherent until the latest stages of the  <dig> hour time course, by which time they often also dissociated.

the animal cap dissociation caused by the mo <dig> morpholino could be largely rescued by co-injection with a xcep2*myc mrna , which has modifications that make it insensitive to translational inhibition by our morpholinos . this suggests that the dissociation observed is not a non-specific toxicity or cross-inhibition effect. xcep2*myc mrna rescued explants showed little difference from non-injected controls at and beyond the  <dig> hour time point.

discussion
the rho gtpases and their associated effector proteins are known to play diverse roles in the regulation of cytoskeletal remodelling, cellular adhesion and cell motility. the complex morphogenetic movements associated with gastrulation in xenopus, including changes in the morphology and polarity of mesodermal cells, and their later mesolateral intercalation of these cells during convergent extension, are now known to be dependent upon rhogtpase functions  <cit>  . currently, however, there is little known regarding the identity or role of specific effector proteins that are utilized to convert changes in the gtp binding state of rhogtpases into gastrulation-associated changes in cytoskeletal architecture, cell morphology, and cellular adhesion and migration.

the data presented here indicate a role for the xenopus cdc <dig> effector protein  <dig>  in gastrulation movements. xcep <dig> is a member of the recently characterized cep family of rho gtpase effector proteins  <cit> , which include the previously characterized mouse protein, mse <dig>  <cit> . effector proteins of the cep family share a conserved expanded crib domain, which binds rho gtpases, and two other highly conserved protein domains   <cit> . by analogy to other rho gtpase effector proteins, it has been proposed that cdc <dig> binding to the crib domain of cep proteins leads to a conformational change that exposes the previously inaccessible ci or cii domains . the exposed domains of the effector protein would then be free to interact with downstream components of the signaling/regulatory pathway. when overexpressed in cultured cells, members of this family of effector protein induce marked pseudopodial/ lamellipodial extensions, membrane ruffling, alterations in actin and vinculin organization, and a reduction of e-cadherin staining at adherens junctions  <cit> .

consistent with a potential role for this class of proteins in embryonic morphogenesis, we have shown that xcep <dig> expression is temporally regulated at gastrulation stages, when major modulations of cellular morphology, cytoskeletal organization, and cellular adhesion are occurring. mrna for xcep <dig> is present prior to mid-blastula transition, persists through mid gastrulation, and is strongly down-regulated by the time the blastopore closes and neurulation begins. this pattern would suggest that xcep <dig> protein would be present through the period when active gastrulation movements are occurring. the diffuse spatial pattern of mrna and, presumably, protein expression of xcep <dig> may suggest that xcep <dig> functions broadly in cells of the animal and equatorial regions. however, the observed broad spatial distribution of xcep <dig> mrna does not preclude the possibility that the xcep <dig> protein may be functionally activated or inactivated at discreet times and locations during early embryonic development.

furthermore, we show that antisense morpholino oligonucleotides capable of blocking translation of the xcep <dig> message interfere with xenopus gastrulation, delay the closure of the blastopore and inhibit embryonic elongation. the observed rescue with xcep <dig> mrna is strong evidence for the specificity of the antisense morpholino effect. these effects are not due to a loss of mesodermal induction, as brachyury and goosecoid expression do not change in response to antisense xcep <dig> morpholinos. this is particularly relevant given recent reports demonstrating a direct link between brachyury expression and control of cellular migration  <cit> .

the effects we report require relatively high, although not unprecedented, doses of morpholino antisense oligonucleotide. this dosage requirement may reflect the difficulty inherent in morpholino-mediated translational knockdown of maternally expressed genes. xcep <dig> mrna and  xcep <dig> protein are present prior to midblastula transition. given this situation, the timing morpholino induced protein downregulation is dependent both upon the effectiveness of translational blockade, and the half life of the protein in the cytoplasm. in this context, it may be essential to impose close to complete translational inhibition in order to reduce protein levels rapidly enough to affect early embryonic events, such as gastrulation.

clearly, specific probes to assess endogenous xcep <dig> protein expression will be necessary for fuller characterization of the role of this protein during gastrulation. for this reason, antibodies are currently being raised against the xcep <dig> protein. these antibodies will be important in the characterization of the developmental time course of endogenous xcep <dig> protein expression, assessment of the subcellular localization of the xcep <dig> protein, isolation of potential xcep <dig> binding partners, and in assessing and further optimizing the extent of protein down-regulation in morpholino injected embryos.

currently, the specific mechanism by which xcep <dig> exerts its role in gastrulation is unknown. however, our preliminary data suggest that xcep <dig> may either contribute to a required "ground state" of cellular adhesion or play a role in modulations in the strength of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion that are known to occur during gastrulation  <cit> . more detailed work will be necessary to clearly distinguish between these possibilities.

in embryos wnt-mediated signals have been shown to activate cdc <dig>  a process that is required for normal gastrulation movements  <cit> . in future work, it will be important to discern whether xcep <dig> plays an important role in transducing these upstream signals into changes in cellular behaviour during gastrulation.

the known functional properties of the cep class of effector proteins, and the characteristics of crib domain effector proteins in general, suggest some interesting possibilities relating to the control of cell adhesion during gastrulation. consistent with the observed functions of the xcep <dig> homologs in cultured cells, xcep <dig> in embryos may impinge on regulatory circuits downstream of cdc <dig> that control actin filament assembly, which in turn may affect diverse cellular processes, including assembly of adherens junctions. alternatively, xcep <dig> may more directly impinge upon cadherin functional activity, perhaps by influencing the association of iqgap or other molecules with cadherin complexes. in future studies, it will also be important to establish whether embryonic activation of whether there are links between wnt-mediated activation of cdc <dig> and functional activation of xcep <dig> and to characterize the mechanism by which xcep <dig> contributes to cell adhesion between cells of gastrulating embryos.

CONCLUSIONS
it has become clear in recent years that an integrated network of signals involving rho gtpase proteins and their effector proteins help to control and regulate the diverse and intricate morphogenetic processes that occur during embryonic development. less clear are the specific modes of functional interaction between the multiple rho gtpases and the diversity of potential effector proteins. we have shown that xcep <dig> is one component in the complex regulatory puzzle contributing to morphogenetic processes during xenopus gastrulation. for this reason it will be interesting and important to discern further the role of xcep <dig>  with regard both to its relationship to intracellular signalling pathways and its effects on cellular behavior during gastrulation.
