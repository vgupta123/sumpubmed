BACKGROUND
an appropriate immune response requires a fine balance between a multitude of activating and inhibitory signals and the loss of the ability to limit positive signaling can result in autoreactivity and excessive inflammation  <cit> . a diverse array of inhibitory receptors participates in the negative control of the immune response. a characteristic of many of these receptors is a consensus amino acid sequence in their cytoplasmic tail, i.e. the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif   <cit> . ligand interaction with these receptors results in itim tyrosine phosphorylation, usually by a src family kinase, providing sites for binding proteins via their src-homology  <dig>  domains  <cit> . proteins containing consensus sequences for interaction with phosphorylated itims include the sh <dig> domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase - <dig>  shp- <dig>  and the sh <dig> domain-containing inositol 5’-phosphatase   <cit> . the recruitment of phosphatases to the phosphorylated itims results in their activation and the subsequent dephosphorylation of their substrates, leading to the down-regulation of activation signals  <cit> . although several targets of these phosphatases have been proposed, the specific pathways and mechanisms by which each phosphatase participates in the signaling cascade downstream from the inhibitory receptors remain incompletely understood  <cit> .

cd300a is one of the seven members of the cd <dig> family of leukocyte surface receptors that are encoded by genes clustered in human chromosome 17q <dig>  <cit> . like the other members of the cd <dig> family, cd300a is a type i transmembrane protein, with a single igv-like extracellular region and three classical and one non-classical itims in its cytoplasmic tail  <cit> . the cd300a gene has undergone a very significant positive selection, suggesting an essential requirement for the host to maintain its function throughout evolution  <cit> . cd300a is expressed on cells of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineages  <cit> . the clinical relevance of this receptor is demonstrated in reports showing the association of a non-synonymous polymorphism within the ig-v domain with the development of psoriasis  <cit> , the implication in the development of alzheimer’s disease by genome wide association studies  <cit> , the down-regulation of cd300a expression on b cells from hiv- <dig> infected patients  <cit> , and the proposed use of cd300a as a biomarker that can differentiate ulcerative colitis from crohn’s disease and non-inflammatory diarrhea  <cit>  and for the detection of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia  <cit> .

in vitro studies have shown that cd300a ligation can inhibit nk cell mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> , fcϵri mediated activation of mast cells  <cit> , fcγriia mediated reactive oxygen species production and ca2+ flux in neutrophils  <cit>  and eosinophils responses to eotaxin, gm-csf and il- <dig>  <cit> . additionally, it has been shown to inhibit both b cell receptor  and t cell receptor  mediated ca2+ mobilization and nfat mediated transcriptional activity  <cit> . furthermore, in vivo studies in mice have shown that cd300a is able to reverse remodeling and airway inflammation in a model of experimental asthma  <cit> , to abrogate ige mediated allergic reactions  <cit>  and to inhibit stem cell factor  induced anaphylaxis  <cit> . various mechanisms of the cd300a mediated inhibitory signaling have been proposed. several publications have shown that phosphorylated cd300a is able to recruit different phosphatases depending on the examined cell type, although genetic evidences for the direct involvement of any phosphatase in the delivery of cd300a mediated inhibitory signal is lacking. for example, treatment of human nk cells with pervanadate led to tyrosine phosphorylation of cd300a and its association with both shp- <dig> and shp- <dig>  <cit> , while in eosinophils cross-linking of the receptor with monoclonal antibodies  recruited shp- <dig> but not shp- <dig>  <cit> . in mast cells, after pervanadate treatment, shp- <dig> and ship, but not shp- <dig> co-precipitated with cd300a, while upon mab driven cross-linking, ship, but not shp- <dig> associated with cd300a  <cit> . also in mast cells, precipitation of cd300a from cells treated with an anti-kit-cd300a bispecific antibody induced its tyrosine phosphorylation and the recruitment of ship, but not shp- <dig>  <cit> .

in t and b lymphocytes the expression of cd300a is restricted to certain subsets  <cit> . although it has been previously shown that ligation of cd300a with mab inhibits bcr  <cit>  and tcr mediated signals  <cit> , the basis for this inhibition is not known. in this study we investigate the structural and functional requirements for cd300a mediated inhibitory signaling in b and t cells. importantly, we establish a physiologically relevant model in which we explore ligand driven functions of cd300a. to accomplish this, a kir-cd300a chimera was expressed in jurkat t cells. mixing these cells with mhc class i matched antigen presenting cells that were loaded with superantigen allowed us to determine the importance of the cd300a itims, the means by which they are phosphorylated and the phosphatases that subsequently associate with them. further studies, using dt <dig> b cell lines and sirna mediated knock down of shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> in jurkat t cells, were performed to discriminate among signaling intermediates utilized by cd300a.

RESULTS
intact itim motifs are required for cd300a mediated inhibitory signal
recently, we have demonstrated that the immunomodulatory receptor cd300a is expressed in certain subsets of human b and t cells and that it functions as a negative regulator of b and t cell signaling  <cit> . to explore the structural requirements for the cd300a mediated inhibitory signal, we have engineered plasmids encoding the cd300a receptor that have the tyrosine residues in the four itims mutated to phenylalanine. the dt <dig> chicken b cell line was stably transfected with plasmids encoding the wild type cd300a receptor  or the cd300a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant receptor . we then examined the inhibitory effects of cd300a ligation on two bcr mediated events. as we have previously shown  <cit> , coligation of the bcr with cd300a wt using mab, resulted in a decreased rise of intracellular ca2+ and a diminished nfat transcriptional activity when compared with ligation of the bcr alone. however, when the experiments were performed with dt <dig> chicken b cells expressing cd300a 4f, no decrease in these bcr mediated events was observed . these results indicate that cd300a mediated inhibition of bcr driven signals is dependent on intact itims.

the intracellular tail of cd300a inhibits superantigen mediated activation of t cells
the above results and those published by others have shown that ligation of cd300a with mab delivers an inhibitory signal in a variety of cell types  <cit> . we sought to investigate the inhibitory signaling potential of cd300a in a system that, instead, relies on receptor-ligand interaction. to do that we established stably transfected jurkat t cell lines expressing a chimeric receptor that retains the transmembrane segment and the intracellular tail of cd300a but substitutes the extracellular portion of the receptor with that of kir2dl <dig> whose ligands are the mhc class i molecules hla-cw <dig>  -cw <dig>  -cw <dig> and -cw <dig>  <cit> . in addition, an ha tag was added at the c terminal end. two jurkat t cell lines were established: kir-cd300a wt, which conserves the wild type sequence of the intracellular tail of cd300a, and kir-cd300a 4f, that has the tyrosine residues of the four cd300a itims mutated to phenylalanine .

to study the ability of kir-cd300a to inhibit tcr mediated signaling, we utilized a system that relies on the activation of jurkat t cells by the bacterial superantigen sed, which binds the tcr vβ chain. in our experimental design, sed is presented by mhc class ii molecules expressed on the human b cell line  <dig> . when jurkat t cells were stimulated with the hla-c negative  <dig>  cells loaded with sed, an increase in the expression of the activation marker cd <dig> was observed. this occurred whether or not the jurkat t cells expressed the kir-cd300a wt or the kir-cd300a 4f chimeric receptors. however, when sed was presented by  <dig>  cells expressing the kir2dl <dig> ligand hla-cw <dig> , we observed a significant reduction in the upregulation of cd <dig> expression by kir-cd300a wt jurkat t cells. conversely, presentation of sed by  <dig> -cw <dig> cells did not affect the upregulation of cd <dig> expression on kir-cd300a 4f jurkat t cells . similar results were obtained when we measured the expression of another activation marker, i.e. cd <dig> . these results indicate that the intracellular tail of cd300a is responsible for inhibiting superantigen mediated activation signals, and confirm that the inhibitory signal requires intact itims.

to further prove that the intracellular tail of cd300a is responsible for the inhibitory signal we performed additional experiments measuring nfat transcriptional activity. we transiently transfected the e <dig>  jurkat t cell line and the kir-cd300a wt and kir-cd300a 4f expressing jurkat t cells with a plasmid encoding the luciferase reporter gene under the control of a nfat dependent promoter. cells were stimulated through the tcr with sed presented by  <dig> ,  <dig> -cw <dig> and  <dig> -cw <dig> cells. the mhc class i molecule hla-cw <dig> is not a ligand for kir2dl <dig>  <cit> . results in figure 3d showed that there was a decrease in the nfat transcriptional activity only when kir-cd300a wt jurkat t cells were stimulated with sed solely presented by  <dig> -cw <dig> cells, and not  <dig>  or  <dig> -cw <dig> cells. these results confirmed that the inhibition of superantigen mediated activation of jurkat t cells required both the specific interaction between kir2dl <dig> with its ligand, hla-cw <dig>  and an intact cd300a intracellular tail.

the src kinase lck is responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of cd300a on jurkat t cells
interaction of itim containing receptors with their ligands leads to itim tyrosine phosphorylation. to demonstrate that cd300a itims are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to kir2dl <dig> ligand in our experimental system, kir-cd300a wt and kir-cd300a 4f jurkat t cells were mixed with  <dig> -cw <dig> and  <dig> -cw <dig> cells and then anti-kir2dl <dig> immunoprecipitates from cell lysates were examined by western blot analysis . we observed that kir-cd300a wt was tyrosine phosphorylated when jurkat t cells interacted with  <dig> -cw <dig> cells but not with  <dig> -cw <dig> cells. pervanadate treatment was used as a positive control. as expected, co-culture of kir-cd300a 4f jurkat t cells with  <dig> -cw <dig> cells did not cause kir-cd300a 4f phosphorylation .

it has been previously described that the src kinase lck is required for kir tyrosine phosphorylation  <cit> . in our experimental system, in order to identify the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of cd300a itims, the e <dig>  jurkat t cell line and the jurkat t cell lines deficient in lck or zap- <dig> were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding kir-cd300a wt. these cells were mixed with  <dig> -cw <dig> or  <dig> -cw <dig> cells and tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed in kir2dl <dig> immunoprecipitates . co-incubation of  <dig> -cw <dig> cells with either the e <dig>  jurkat t cell line or the zap- <dig> deficient cells led to tyrosine phosphorylation of kir-c300a, indicating that zap- <dig> is not necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular tail of cd300a. however, when jurkat t cells deficient in lck were incubated with  <dig> -cw <dig>  tyrosine phosphorylation of kir-cd300a was not observed in any of the immunoprecipitates. as expected, co-incubation of any jurkat t cell lines with  <dig> -cw <dig> cells did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of kir-cd300a wt. together, these results show that ligand-receptor interaction leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the cd300a itims in the absence of an activation signal, and that the src kinase lck is responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the cd300a itim motifs in jurkat t cells.

both shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> bind to cd300a itim, but only shp- <dig> is necessary for cd300a mediated inhibition
tyrosine phosphorylation of itims creates docking sites for sh <dig> domain containing proteins. itims are known to specifically recruit phosphatases including shp- <dig>  shp- <dig> and ship  <cit> . to identify potential phosphatases that bind to cd300a itims, kir-cd300a wt jurkat t cells were treated with pervanadate or mixed with  <dig> -cw <dig> and  <dig> -cw <dig> cells and anti-kir immunoprecipitates were probed with antibodies to shp- <dig> and shp- <dig>  both shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> coprecipitated with kir-cd300a wt when cells were either treated with pervanadate or cocultured with  <dig> -cw <dig> cells but not  <dig> -cw <dig> cells . as expected, neither phosphatase coprecipitated with kir-cd300a 4f . binding of ship to cd300a itims could not be assessed in this system since jurkat t cells do not express this phosphatase .

in order to ascertain which of the phosphatases were responsible for the cd300a mediated inhibitory response, we made again use of the dt <dig> chicken b cells due to the availability of cell lines lacking shp- <dig>  shp- <dig> or ship. stable transfectants expressing cd300a wt were established in each of these cell lines and they were tested for inhibition of bcr stimulated ca2+ mobilization. in shp- <dig> and ship lacking dt <dig> chicken b cells, the coligation of the bcr with cd300a wt resulted in a decrease in the bcr stimulated rise of intracellular ca2+ concentration similar to that obtained with wild type dt <dig> chicken b cells, suggesting that shp- <dig> and ship do not have a primary role in the transmission of the cd300a inhibitory signal. on the other hand, the cd300a mediated inhibition of bcr induced ca2+ mobilization was largely abolished in cells lacking shp- <dig> . the dominant role of shp- <dig> in cd300a inhibitory signal was confirmed by a significant decrease in the cd300a mediated inhibition of bcr induced nfat transcriptional activity in the shp- <dig> deficient cells . to further demonstrate the specific employment of shp- <dig>  we reconstituted shp- <dig> deficient dt <dig> chicken b cells with human shp- <dig> wt and shp- <dig> cs. while the expression of human shp- <dig> wt restored the inhibitory activity of cd300a, expression of shp- <dig> cs, an inactive version of the phosphatase, did not . we also reconstituted the shp- <dig> deficient dt <dig> chicken b cells with human shp- <dig> wt and shp- <dig> cs. the expression of both human shp- <dig> wt and shp- <dig> cs resulted in a decrease in the cd300a mediated inhibition of bcr induced ca2+ release when compared to shp- <dig> deficient cells . finally, we efficiently suppressed the expression of shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> in the kir-cd300a wt jurkat t cells with specific sirna. results showed that while knock down of shp- <dig> in kir-cd300a wt jurkat t cells has no effect in inhibiting cd <dig> induced expression after stimulation with  <dig> -cw <dig> cells loaded with sed, the shp- <dig> knock down resulted in a decrease in the inhibitory potential of kir-cd300a wt in suppressing cd <dig> induced expression after stimulation with sed loaded  <dig> -cw <dig> cells . taken together, these results indicate that although both shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> bind cd300a itims, shp- <dig> is the dominant phosphatase in the cd300a mediated signaling pathway, while shp- <dig> and ship do not have a significant role.

discussion
in this report, we provide evidence that the primary function of cd300a in t and b cells is to limit antigen receptor mediated positive signaling and that the phosphatase shp- <dig> is required for this function. coligation of the bcr and cd300a with mab reduced bcr stimulated ca2+ mobilization and nfat transcriptional activity. in the absence of shp- <dig>  but not shp- <dig> or ship, cd300a mediated inhibition was significantly reduced. additionally, we show that superantigen induced activation was inhibited when jurkat t cells expressing the chimeric receptor kir-cd300a were mixed with antigen presenting cells expressing the kir2dl <dig> ligand hla-cw <dig>  the interaction of kir-cd300a with its ligand led to the tyrosine phosphorylation of cd300a itim motifs. this phosphorylation required the src kinase lck, and provided docking sites for the binding of the phosphatases shp- <dig> and shp- <dig>  these early events were followed by the inhibition of superantigen mediated up-regulation of activation markers cd <dig> and cd <dig> 

the employment of two different models in attempting to understand cd300a inhibitory signal in lymphocytes was very important in our studies. since dt <dig> chicken b cells do not express cd300a, the usage of these cells and their knockout counterparts allowed us to specifically express both cd300a and phosphatases, wild type and mutants, and to investigate the role of phosphatases in cd300a signaling transmission. in our hands, and with the available anti-cd300a mab, we were unable to immunoprecipitate cd300a . due to this inability to immunoprecipitate cd300a and, because we also were interested in an experimental system that relies on receptor-ligand interaction, we generated the chimeric receptor kir-cd300a. results obtained with similar chimeric receptors have proved useful in gaining information about the role of the itims. for example, by using a chimeric receptor consisting of kir extracellular domain fused to the fcγriib intracellular tail, gupta et al. demonstrated that the itims in the intracellular tail, and not the extracellular portion, are responsible for the transmission of the inhibitory signal and determined which phosphatase was employed  <cit> .

for a more comprehensive understanding of cd300a mediated signaling on lymphocytes, mutational analysis of the itims should prove helpful. lankry et al. have undertaken these studies using the human yts nk cell line  <cit> . their results indicated that all of the itims, including the non-classical 4th itim, were important for the inhibitory function of cd300a, with the 3rd itim being the most essential. results obtained in our laboratory in which we mutated tyrosine residues to phenlyalanine instead of to alanine, as described by lankry et al.  <cit> , have confirmed that a single mutation of the 3rd itim significantly decreased bcr stimulated ca2+ release and nfat transcriptional activity .

in our kir-cd300a chimera, the cd300a itims were phosphorylated upon interaction with the kir ligand without the requirement of superantigen stimulation. this is not surprising, since phosphorylation of kir itims by lck also occurs independently of antigen stimulation  <cit> . however, it is interesting that a single tyrosine kinase, such as lck, can be utilized for both inhibitory and activating receptors. while the mechanism by which this occurs is still under investigation, findings obtained by stefanova et al.  <cit>  may shed some light on this conundrum. in that report, antagonist and agonist peptides, defined by their different binding affinities to the tcr, were used to dissect the seemingly different roles of lck in t cell homeostasis. the shp- <dig> tyrosine phosphatase was a central player in their findings. when t cells were stimulated with a weak binding ligand, lck phosphorylated shp- <dig>  subsequent association of shp- <dig> with lck mediated the recruitment of shp- <dig> to the tcr complex where it was proposed that shp- <dig> then dephosphorylated lck at y <dig> leading to tcr desensitization. alternatively, upon interaction with a strong tcr ligand, erk was rapidly activated and phosphorylated lck on serine residues . this serine phosphorylation decreased the ability of lck to bind shp- <dig> and therefore the positive signaling proceeded. here, we have shown that lck is involved in cd300a phosphorylation. it may be possible that lck also phosphorylates cd300a bound shp- <dig>  subsequently aiding in the recruitment of shp- <dig> to the tcr complex, leading to the inhibition of positive signaling. future studies should address this hypothesis.

our results using shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> knocked down kir-cd300a wt jurkat t cells and specific phosphatase deficient dt <dig> chicken b cells indicated that shp- <dig>  but not shp- <dig> or ship was necessary for cd300a mediated inhibition of bcr and tcr signaling. although mab cross-linking induced coimmunoprecipitation of ship with cd300a in mast cells  <cit> , the consensus binding sequences for ship are different from that of shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> and are not present in cd300a. ship has no preference for binding to residues n-terminal to the phosphorylated tyrosine  but has a strong preference for leu at the + <dig> position. instead, shp sh <dig> domains prefer a hydrophobic residue at the − <dig> position on the itim  <cit> . all three classical itims present in cd300a have hydrophobic residues at − <dig> and none of them have leu at + <dig> position  <cit> . therefore, while the detection of ship in a complex with cd300a may indicate a role for ship in the control of signaling in mast cells, its direct binding to cd300a itim motifs is unlikely. on the other hand, the consensus binding motifs for shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> are similar  <cit>  and matched sequences are found in the cd300a intracellular tail  <cit> . indeed, both shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> were detected in immunoprecipitates from ligand stimulated jurkat t cells expressing the kir-cd300a chimeric receptor. however, according to previously published results that tested the binding of shp sh <dig> domains to py peptide libraries  <cit> , it may be that the chances of having both sh <dig> domains of a single phosphatase bound simultaneously to phosphorylated cd300a intracellular tail are greater with shp- <dig>  while binding of a single sh <dig> domain may potentiate phosphatase activity, binding of both domains further increases the activity by several fold  <cit> .

further evidence that both shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> bind to cd300a comes from the shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> reconstitution experiments. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression of either shp- <dig> cs or shp- <dig> cs reduced the inhibitory function of cd300a. the mutation of the cysteine residue renders the phosphatases catalytically inactive, but they still are able to bind the target itim sequences and therefore become dominant negative. in that same line of thought, one could argue that since shp- <dig> wt also competes for cd300a itim occupancy, it could also function as a dominant negative, and in fact, reconstitution of cd300a expressing dt <dig> chicken b cells lacking shp- <dig> with human shp- <dig> wt resulted in a decrease in the cd300a mediated inhibitory ability when compared with non-reconstituted dt <dig> cells lacking shp- <dig> . additional studies designed to address the relative binding affinity of shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> to phosphorylated cd300a itims and their differential role in signaling should prove interesting.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we have demonstrated that cd300a inhibits lymphocyte immune receptor signaling via shp- <dig>  although both shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> are recruited to the phosphorylated itims of cd300a, only the absence of shp- <dig> limited the ability of cd300a to inhibit activation signals. shp- <dig> has historically been associated with negative signaling while shp- <dig> has been associated with positive signals  <cit> . beyond similarities in their sh <dig> domains, the two phosphatases display little sequence homology. shp- <dig> but not shp- <dig> displays localization signals in particular for lipid rafts while only shp- <dig> has proline-rich domains which could recruit sh <dig> domain containing proteins  <cit> . however, the specific roles of these regions may play in the function of the two phosphatases remains to be defined. with this in mind, the availability of the different phosphatases to bind the cd300a intracellular tail following receptor ligation will determine the final outcome of the cd300a mediated signaling.
