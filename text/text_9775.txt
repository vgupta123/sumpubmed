BACKGROUND
the minimum inhibitory concentration  and minimum bactericidal concentration  were used to evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobial drugs to eradicate the entire pathogen population  <cit> . the mutant prevention concentration  has been proposed to evaluate the ability of antimicrobial agents to prevent the emergence of antibacterial resistance  <cit> . pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics  principles may provide an effective way to control the occurrence and dissemination of bacterial resistance  <cit> . for fluoroquinolones, the pk/pd indices are calculated by the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to mic  and the ratio of peak drug concentration to mic   <cit> . recently, the values of auc/mpc and cmax/mpc were determined to minimize the occurrence of the antibacterial resistance  <cit> .

muscovy ducks are reared for their distinctive taste, high yield of breast meat and low calorie content  <cit> . colibacillosis is the most common disease in the poultry industry causing serious death and economic losses worldwide, e.g. in china  <cit> . birds infected with avian pathogenic escherichia coli  are more likely to develop infectious bursal disease, mycoplasmosis, coccidiosis, newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis, and nutritional deficiencies  <cit> . apec are responsible for aerosacculitis, polyserositis, pericarditis, yolk sac infection, respiratory tract infection, septicemia and other extra-intestinal diseases in chickens, turkeys, ducks and other avian species . serotype o <dig> is recognized as one of the most common and prevalent serogrouping of apec isolates  <cit> . e. coli strains with the o <dig> serotype are highly pathogenic and commonly exist in poultry industry. therefore, treatment of colibacillosis caused by apec o <dig> demands far more attention in poultry farming. however, current vaccines have poor efficacy, and therapy is mainly based on antimicrobial therapy.

sarafloxacin, a second generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic exclusively developed for veterinary use, shows excellent antimicrobial activity , and is mainly used to treat colibacillosis by binding to topoisomerase ii in gram-negative bacteria . in the european union, sarafloxacin was proposed for use in poultry and fish in  <dig>  <cit> ; and difloxacin  was authorized in  <dig> but in the meantime the marketing authorization was withdrawn  <cit> .

publications have reported the pharmacokinetics of sarafloxacin in several animals and birds  <cit> ; however, few studies focused on the pk/pd modeling of sarafloxacin in muscovy ducks. the aims of this work are to: 1) study the pk/pd modeling of sarafloxacin; 2) optimize the clinical dosage regimens for treatment of colibacillosis in muscovy ducks particularly against the e.coli o <dig> strains; and 3) assess the risks of using sarafloxacin employing the mpc theory.

methods
bacterium and reagents
the experiments were performed using an apec o <dig> strain  isolated from ducks colibacillosis and stored in our laboratory. phylogenetic grouping of this strain was b <dig> type and determined by multiplex pcr using specific primers from chua, yjaa genes and tspe <dig> c <dig> fragment. e. coli atcc  <dig>  was used for the quality control purpose. sarafloxacin was purchased from unichna bio-technology of zhengzhou co., ltd, zhengzhou, china.

animals and experimental design
twenty-four healthy muscovy ducks  of 100–120 days old and weighing  <dig> – <dig>  kg were used. ducks were fed commercial drug-free food. all ducks were examined daily, adapted well to the environment, and were clinically healthy prior to the study. all protocols were approved by the animal research committees of south china agricultural university. all experiments were conducted using the guidelines of the american association for accreditation of laboratory animal care   <cit> .

animals were randomly divided into two groups of 12/group. feed was eliminated for 12 h before and 6 h post-administration. sarafloxacin  was injected intravenously into the left brachial vein at 10 mg/kg body weight . for oral administration, a soluble powder , was directly administered into the crop at 10 mg/kg bw. blood samples were collected from the right brachial vein at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  45 min, and  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  36 h post-i.v. administration. for p.o. administration, the time points for blood collection were at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  45 min, and  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  36 h. the serum samples were obtained by centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min and stored at − 20 °c until analyses within 2 weeks.

sarafloxacin analysis
a total of  <dig>  ml acetonitrile was added into  <dig>  ml of serum sample. the mixture was rigorously vortexed for 1 min, and then centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 5 min. the supernatant was filtered through a  <dig>  μm cellulose membrane, and 10 μl were injected into the reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography  system. this rp-hplc includes a  <dig> waters alliance system , a hypersil bds c <dig> column , and a hypers. the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid  at 1 ml/min flow rate. a waters  <dig> fluorescence detector operated at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm.

the retention time of sarafloxacin in the serum was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min. the standard curve of sarafloxacin was linear in the range of  <dig> –10 μg/ml with correlation coefficient  of  <dig> . the recovery of sarafloxacin from serum ranged from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to 104 ±  <dig> %. the limit of detection  and limit of quantitation  were  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively.

protein binding
in vitro protein binding was determined using an ultracentrifugation method  <cit> . sarafloxacin was added to blank plasma samples to produce concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> and 10 μg/ml. after 1 h incubation at 37 °c,  <dig>  ml of each sample was placed in a microcon ym- <dig> centrifugal filter device , and centrifuged at 1500 g for 20 min at 4 °c. nonspecific binding of the drug to the ultrafiltration membrane was also determined. the drug concentrations in drug-free plasma samples and ultrafiltrate samples were determined as described above. the in vitro plasma protein binding of sarafloxacin was calculated using the following equation: bp%=1−cu/ct×100% where cu is the concentration in the ultrafiltrate, and ct is the total drug concentration.

mic, mbc and mpc
the mic and mbc were determined in both mueller hinton broth  and drug-free serum using a standard broth micro-dilution method  <cit> . mpc was determined as previously described with slight modifications  <cit> . a single colony was grown overnight in 10 ml mhb, and 1 ml of this culture was then transferred to 100 ml mhb for 24 h incubation. the culture was washed twice with pbs and centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min at 4 °c. the precipitate was re-suspended in 10 ml of mhb to obtain a 1010 cfu/ml bacterial load. aliquots of 100 μl were re-suspended and applied to mha plates containing sarafloxacin at concentrations of 1× to 128× mic. mpc was recorded as the lowest concentration that prevented bacterial growth after 72 h incubation.

time-killing curves
in vitro time-killing curve experiments were conducted in mhb and blank serum using drug concentrations ranged from  <dig>  × to 16 × mic. serum samples obtained at  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h post-p.o. administration were used to measure the ex vivo time-killing curves. the initial bacterial counts were about 106 cfu/ml. the 50 μl aliquot was diluted appropriately, and 100 μl of each dilution were applied onto mha plates at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h. all agar plates were incubated at 37 °c for 18 h. the limit of detection  was 100 cfu/ml.

pk analysis
pharmacokinetic data were analyzed using the winnonlin program  based on a non-compartmental model. the bioavailability was estimated by the following equation: f%=aucpo/auciv×100% where aucpo is the auc after p.o. administration, and auciv is the auc after i.v. injection.

pk/pd integration and modeling
the pk/pd modeling was analyzed by the sigmoid emax model of winnonlin software. the equation was defined as: e=emax−emax−e0×cn/cn+ec50n 


where e is the antibacterial effect. e
max is the log <dig> difference in bacterial counts between  <dig> and 24 h in the control sample. e
 <dig> is the log <dig> difference in bacterial counts between  <dig> and 24 h in the sample containing sarafloxacin when the lod of 100 cfu/ml is reached. c is the pk/pd indexes. ec <dig> is the pk/pd surrogate parameters producing 50% of the maximal antibacterial. n is the hill coefficient which describes the slope of the sigmoid curves.

the pk/pd surrogate markers of antibacterial activity, including cmax/mic, auc0-24h/mic, cmax/mpc and auc0-24h/mpc, were determined using in vitro pd data and in vivo pk values post-i.v. and -p.o. administration of sarafloxacin. in this model, auc0-24h/mic values were calculated according to the four levels of antibacterial effectiveness: a bacteriostatic action , a 50% reduction in colony counts, a bactericidal action , and a bacterial elimination effect   <cit> .

evaluation of dosage regimens
optimal dosage providing a specific antibacterial effect was calculated using the following equation: doseperday=clperhour×auc0‐24h/mic×mic/f×fu 


where cl is the clearance, auc0-24h/mic is the ratio of the area under serum concentration-time curve over a 24 h period to mic value achieved from pk/pd integration, f is the bioavailability, fu is the unbound fraction of sarafloxacin.

statistical analysis
the pk and ex vivo pk/pd data are presented as mean ± sd. all the data are conducted using the spss  <dig>  software package .

time-killing curves
in vitro time-killing curves of sarafloxacin against are shown in fig.  <dig>  bacterial growth was inhibited obviously at drug concentration at 1 × mic, but re-growth was observed after 9 h of incubation. however, the number of bacteria after incubation for 24 h was still below the initial load. for exposure at drug concentration at 2 × mic, a bactericidal activity was observed in 24 h, but bacterial cells were not eradicated in the serum samples. when drug concentration was raised from 4 × to 16 × mic, better antibacterial effectiveness was achieved, showing both bactericidal and eradication effect in 3 h of incubation.fig.  <dig> in vitro time-kill curves of sarafloxacin against the e. coli o <dig> strain in serum  and mhb . numerical values on the right represent sarafloxacin concentrations

discussion
sarafloxacin mics in mhb or serum against the e. coli o <dig> strain used in this study were  <dig>  ~  <dig>  μg/ml, which is moderate susceptible comparing with previous reports  <cit> . in this study, a low ratio of mbc/mic suggests that sarafloxacin has bactericidal activity against the e. coli o <dig> strain. in addition, the mpc/mic ratio for sarafloxacin was in agreement with the values calculated for fluoroquinolones from previous reports  <cit> .

in muscovy ducks, sarafloxacin was rapidly and extensively distributed into body fluids and tissues after i.v. administration. a calculated distribution volume was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  l/kg, which is higher than that in broilers  <cit> . the t
1/2β after i.v. injection of sarafloxacin was estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h, much higher than those reported in pigs and chickens  <cit> , and a slightly higher than that of marbofloxacin in ducks  <cit> . therefore, a longer withdrawal time may be required in muscovy ducks than in other food-producing animals for consideration of residue food safety concerns. a maximum concentration  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml following p.o. administration of sarafloxacin in this study was observed at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h. bioavailability was  <dig> % in ducks, which was much higher than the previously reported values of  <dig> % in pigs,  <dig> % in chickens  <cit> , but similar to that of marbofloxacin and moxifloxacin in ducks  <cit> , indicating a rapid and almost complete absorption following p.o. administration. total body clearance was  <dig>  l/kg/h, similarly to that in broilers  <cit> . the aucs after i.v. and p.o. administrations were comparable with the results obtained from chickens and pigs  <cit> .

it is recognized that only the unbound fraction of the drug has the antibacterial activity  <cit> . the plasma protein binding of sarafloxacin was  <dig> %, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . based on the time-killing curves, antibacterial activity of sarafloxacin against the e. coli strains was concentration-dependent. similar to other fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, the ratios of auc0-24h/mic and cmax/mic were key pk-pd parameters correlating with clinical efficacy in target animals  <cit> . attainment target of auc0-24h/mic of 100–125 h or cmax/mic of 8– <dig> should be obtained for fluoroquinolones in order to exert great bacteriological and treatment effects against gram-negative bacterial pathogens; on the contrary, auc0-24h/mic of 30 h should be achieved against gram-positive pathogens  <cit> . however, optimal pk/pd endpoints for fluoroquinolones were not fixed dependent upon combinations of drug, pathogen and target species, as described in previous reports  <cit> . thus, appropriate endpoints of pk/pd parameters should be established for specific drug against specific pathogen in given target animal species. in the present study, the values of auc0-24h/mic theoretically needed for bacteriostatic, bactericidal and eradication activity were calculated using the sigmoid e
max model. the value calculated for eradication activity against the e. coli o <dig> strain  was smaller than the literature value of 125 h  <cit> . at a dosage of 10 mg/kg bw administered p.o., the in vivo auc0-24h/mic ratio for the e. coli o <dig> strain  was slightly lower than the ex vivo auc0-24h/mic ratio required for bactericidal action . these results indicated that the dosage of 10 mg/kg bw was not high enough to cure colibacillosis caused by e. coli o <dig> . thus, daily dosage regimens for sarafloxacin following p.o. administration to achieve bacteriostatic, bactericidal and eradicaton effects were calculated as  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/kg bw, respectively for dose optimization. considering that sarafloxacin is concentration dependent antibiotic and convenience of clinical application, single dose administration daily is recommended.

as described in other previous reports  <cit> , the mpc theory is also taken into consideration when optimizing the sarafloxacin dosage regimens in ducks. traditional pk/pd modeling regards mic and mbc as the major pd parameters; however, they may have only considered antibacterial activity against pathogenic population  <cit> . with the increasing of antimicrobial resistance, the mpc and mutant prevention window  have been used to evaluate antibacterial activity to prevent selection and development of antibacterial resistant mutants. the new pk/pd parameters, including auc0-24h/mpc, cmax/mpc and t > mpc, were used for the optimization of dosage regimens in the current study. in this study the values of auc0-24h/mpc and cmax/mpc  for sarafloxacin against the e. coli o <dig> strain were comparable to the values  obtained for enrofloxacin against pasteurella multocida in buffalo calves  <cit>  and the values  obtained for marbofloxacin against e. coli  <cit> . according to previous reports, the values of auc0-24h/mpc of  <dig> to 12 h could prevent occurrence of resistant mutants for marbofloxacin against e. coli  <cit> , which means average plasma concentration being  <dig>  ~ 50% of mpc value can achieve a efficacy of preventing resistant mutants based on the dimensional perspective of auc/mic theory  <cit> . in order to cure diseased animals and control selection and development of drug resistance, the drug concentration in serum should exceed the mpc value as long as possible  <cit> . in this study, the value of t > mpc for sarafloxacin was  <dig>  h, which was short due to high mpc. similarly, auc0-24h/mpc and cmax/mpc from this study were lower than the values reported in literature for preventing the selection of resistant mutants. therefore, the auc/mpc of  <dig>  h of sarafloxacin may be insufficient for preventing resistant mutant in the current work. further study is needed to better understand the pk/pd characteristic for sarafloxacin, considering the interaction of drugs, pathogens and animal species.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, it is the first report about the pk/pd modeling study for sarafloxacin in muscovy ducks targeting avian pathogenic e. coli o <dig> strain. ex vivo pk/pd modeling and the mpc theory were used to optimize reasonable dosage regimens. our findings suggested that a single dose of 10 mg/kg bw administered orally is insufficient to treat infection caused by e. coli o <dig> with an mic of  <dig>  or higher. in addition, a higher dose of sarafloxacin is needed to minimize occurrence of antimicrobial resistance with consideration of mpc theory.
