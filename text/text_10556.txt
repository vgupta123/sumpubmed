BACKGROUND
the melanocytes are skin cells of neural crest origin that constitute 5% - 20% of the basal layer of human epidermis  <cit> . the cell type is responsible for the melanin pigment production and thus the colour patterning of skin and hair in mammals. melanoma, a cancer originating in melanocytes, is in its later stages notoriously resistant to treatment, and although good prognostic markers exist, the understanding of the underlying biology is only slowly forthcoming  <cit> . while knowledge about each single protein and gene involved in melanocyte development and regulation of homeostasis is important, developing an understanding of the signalling networks connecting the receptors on the surface to the regulating effect on gene transcription in the nucleus appears crucial in implementing efficient molecular treatment strategies in the dawning era of personalized cancer therapy.

expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor , the signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , and their co-regulation via protein inhibitor of activated stat <dig> , are all tightly connected to cell differentiation, proliferation and survival. mitf is considered to be a master regulatory gene for melanocytes, and has been shown to play important roles in the regulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression, including bcl- <dig> and cdk <dig>  <cit> . mitf is also of clinical significance, as mitf mutations in humans cause waardenburg syndrome type ii  <cit> , and a significant number of malignant melanomas harbour mitf amplifications. mitf has also been proposed to be important for both differentiation of melanocytes and for tumour transformation  <cit> . mitf has two phosphorylation sites influencing the pias <dig> binding: s <dig> and s <dig>  these sites are phosphorylated by different kinases in the mapk pathway, the erk and rsk, respectively  <cit> .

stat <dig> is a transcription factor involved in signal transduction pathways that are activated by several extracellular stimuli, including the il- <dig> family of cytokines. it is tyrosine phosphorylated by the janus kinase  or src. the resulting signal mediates cell growth, differentiation, and survival  <cit> . the underlying molecular details have only partly been elucidated  <cit> .

pias <dig> has been identified as an inhibitor of both activated stat <dig> and mitf  <cit> . pias <dig> can bind activated stat <dig>  as well as non-activated mitf in one of its two inactive complexes. the phosphorylation of mitf at s <dig> results in mitf dissociation from the complex, and more pias <dig> is thereby made available. as a result, more stat <dig> is bound in complex with pias <dig> and is thus prevented from binding dna and activating target genes  <cit> . similarly, expression of constitutively active stat <dig> will complex with unbound pias <dig>  resulting in less pias <dig> being available for binding to mitf. consequently, more active mitf is observed  <cit> .

the connection between mitf, stat <dig> and pias <dig>  has several interesting features:  mitf and stat <dig> interacts through binding and sequestration of their common inhibitor pias <dig>  <cit> ,  pias <dig> binds to phosphorylated  stat <dig>  but disassociates from activated mitf  <cit>  which introduces an asymmetry to the network,  mitf has two phosphorylation sites interfering with pias <dig> binding, and all four resulting phosphorylation states have different binding affinities to pias <dig>  <cit> . we have developed a mathematical model to incorporate quantitative aspects of the system in order to both test if the current conceptions of the system can account for observed results, and to serve as a framework for further studies of this module's interaction with other pathways. see figure  <dig> for a graphical representation of the model. this dynamic model of the mitf-pias3-stat <dig> system was designed to be simple, while still being capable of reproducing the available results. the inputs to the model are the activation events of the two transcription factors mitf and pias <dig>  when mitf becomes phosphorylated at s <dig> and/or s <dig>  the affinity to pias <dig>  the degradation rate and the transcriptional activity are altered. on the other hand, stat <dig> has only one relevant phosphorylation site, which is phosphorylated by jak. when stat <dig> becomes phosphorylated, the affinity to pias <dig> and the transcriptional activity is altered. as output, the activation levels of the two transcription factors are monitored: for stat <dig>  this implies the amount of phosphorylated protein, while for mitf it represents a complex feature of the distribution of mitf among the four phosphorylation states.

RESULTS
constraining model behaviour and parameter domains
default values for the set of core parameters common to all experimental settings were obtained partly directly from the literature and partly by fitting model behaviour to available data. these core parameters describe degradation rate, production rate, binding affinity, and phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation rate . for further details on the parameter value deduction, see methods. we next singled out a representative selection consisting of  <dig> well-reported experiments addressing various relevant aspects of the mitf-stat3-pias <dig> system , and tested to what degree the model was able to account for the available experimental data. for each experiment, a set of experiment-specific parameters, such as the effect of transfection on production rates or the activation level in growing cells, was specifically incorporated to reflect the experimental setup and conditions. these parameters were specifically set for each experiment. in those cases where the experiments were replicates, the experiment-specific parameters were given identical values. while keeping the core parameters at default values, we manually searched for experiment specific parameter values that minimized the distance between the simulation output and the reported results of the focal lab-experiment. the experiment-specific perturbations of the model are provided in the methods section. we found that we were able to account reasonably well for  <dig> of the  <dig> experiments. only experiment # <dig> seems to be beyond explanatory reach by our model framework.

the parameter names follow a naming convention. the rate constants for phosphorylation events is a k with a subscript starting with a protein specification , followed by a specification of a phosphorylation site  and finalized with a ' + ' for phosphorylation rate constants and ' - ' for de-phosphorylation rate constants. the association and dissociation rate constants is a k with a subscript starting with a protein specification followed by a phosphorylation state specification, and finalized with ' ass ' or ' diss ' respectively. the name of the parameters denoting the production or degradation rates start with a p or a γ respectively, and ends with a specification of the protein . the two constants erkp and jakp, represent the amounts of phosphorylated erk and jak, respectively. these are altered to emulate signalling through the respective pathways. 'ku' is the ubiquitination rate constant.

the numbers assigned to each experiment in the table is used to identify the experiment throughout this paper. for each experiment the reference and the figure number within the reference are provided.

robustness of fit between model results and experimental data
we next investigated how sensitive the obtained fit between the experimental data and the model results was with respect to variation in the core parameter values, in the  <dig> successful cases examined. while keeping the experiment-specific parameters unchanged,  <dig> sets of the core parameters were sampled uniformly on a logarithmic scale from a hypercube centred at the default parameter values and within the range  <dig> - <dig> × of each default value. for all sampled parameter sets, we simulated the  <dig> successful experiments in table  <dig> and recorded success or failure accordingly. by analysing the  <dig> ×  <dig> parameter matrix and the corresponding  <dig> ×  <dig> result matrix we studied the sensitivity of the success rate of each experiment to variation in a given parameter by computing success rates in bins of sorted parameter sets, and used the sum of absolute deviations from the overall success rate to range the parameters according to sensitivity . each experiment tested different features of the system, which is reflected in the parameter sensitivity. some experiments are sensitive only to one parameter. for example experiment # <dig>  which investigated the temporal development of erk and rsk <dig> kinase activities, and experiment # <dig>  which investigated the transcriptional activity of the mitf-s73d mutant in response to transfection of pias <dig> were both sensitive to a single parameter, the rsk <dig> phosphorylation rate constant krp+ and the pias <dig> production rate pplas <dig>  respectively. on the other hand, experiment # <dig>  which investigated the mitf-pias <dig> association in response to activation, and experiment # <dig>  which investigated s409a mutated mitf-pias <dig> association in response to activation were both sensitive to more than half the parameters. further, it was observed that the experiments that dealt only with mitf and the mitf-pias <dig> connection, and not with stat <dig> , were only affected by the parameters regarding mitf. on the other hand, experiments # <dig> to # <dig> were sensitive only to perturbations of the stat <dig> phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation constants, as well as the level of phosphorylated jak. notably, three parameters did not affect the results of any experiment: kmp409ass, kmp409diss, and pmitf. in addition, three parameters had only weak effects: pstat <dig>  γstat3and ku.

interpretation and qualification of selected experiments
most of the experiment-specific simulations suggest that the main underlying biological mechanisms seem to be captured by the model. as an example, the result of experiment # <dig> is plotted alongside the original figure from  <cit>  in figure  <dig>  the temporal development for all variables for all experiment simulations can be found in additional file  <dig> - simulationfigures.zip. in the following, we consider only those experiments in need of further interpretation and qualification.

in experiment # <dig>  the mitf-pias <dig> association after activation was investigated. bl6-b <dig> melanoma cells were co-transfected with mitf and pias <dig>  after  <dig> hours, the cells were treated with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate  for  <dig> minutes. the amount of mitf-pias <dig> complex was measured before, and after  <dig> and  <dig> minutes of tpa treatment . two different interpretations of the two bands representing mitf have been proposed. in all cases, the lower band is considered as representing un-phosphorylated mitf, while the upper band may represent all phosphorylated states, or alternatively only s <dig> phosphorylated mitf  <cit> . if we assume that the upper band corresponds to all phosphorylated mitf-pias <dig> complexes , we can predict the temporal development of the distribution among the different phosphorylation states. in our simulations , the amount of un-phosphorylated mitf-pias <dig> complex decreases rapidly, which is in accordance with the lower band in figure 5a. the sum of all the phosphorylated states is high after  <dig> minutes, and is falling again after  <dig> min, which is in accordance with the higher band in figure 5i. the distribution among the phosphorylated states can thus be viewed as a prediction. however, it has been suggested that the upper band represents only s <dig> phosphorylated mitf  <cit> , which is also supported by our model. the s <dig> phosphorylated complex is also high after  <dig> minutes, and falls again after  <dig> minutes. if this is the case, the temporal development of the other phosphorylated complexes  can be viewed as predictions of undetected mitf-pias <dig> phosphorylation states.

in experiments # <dig> -  <dig>  the transcriptional activity of stat <dig> was measured in nih 3t <dig> fibroblasts that were co-transfected with stat <dig>  pias <dig>  and with different doses  of mitf . after  <dig> hours of incubation, the cells were activated with il6/il6r for  <dig> h. transcriptional activity of stat <dig> was measured, and the mean ± the sem of three experiments is shown in figure 6a. the simulations of these experiments, which were performed with equal experiment-specific parameters, captured the reported results well . however, there is a striking, but un-noticed result both in the lab experiment and the simulation in that there is no effect of adding the smaller amount of wtmitf, while there is a rather big effect of adding the greater amount of wtmitf. because of this similarity in the nonlinearity between the model simulation and the data, an inspection of the model and the simulation results may provide insight to the underlying mechanism. during the incubation time, when the transfected genes are being transcribed and translated to their respective proteins, complexes will be formed continuously. when mitf is added, the pias3-mitf complex will form. the sequestering of pias <dig> is not only making it unavailable for stat <dig> inhibition, but also rescues pias <dig> from degradation. in the case where the smaller amount of mitf was added, these two effects would have cancelled each other out, while in the case where the greater amount of mitf was added, all pias <dig> would be sequestered, resulting in a saturated rescuing effect.

in experiment # <dig>  a comparison was performed between mitf wild type and a mutant that was transcriptionally active, but unable to bind pias <dig>  transcriptional activity was measured by rtpcr on the mrna of mitf and stat <dig> target genes at  <dig> minutes and at  <dig> hours after activation. when the cells were transfected with wild type mitf, elevated transcriptional activity was observed for both transcription factors after activation. however, when the cells were transfected with the mitf mutant, neither mitf nor stat <dig> displayed elevated transcriptional activity . the model was able to mimic the change in transcriptional activity of mitf in reaction to activation for both wild type and mutated mitf , while the transcriptional activity of stat <dig> was not in accordance with the experimental data. in the simulation of this experiment, the transcriptional activity of stat <dig> increased in response to activation, regardless of mitf mutation status . in the lab experiment, this increased transcriptional activity was only seen in the cells with wild type mitf and not in the cells with mutated mitf. the authors of the original paper conclude that pias <dig>  being unable to bind the mutated mitf, is accessible for binding and thus inhibition of stat <dig>  in the model simulations, there was indeed more pias <dig> available in the case with mutated mitf, which causes the lower peak in the level of phosphorylated stat <dig> in this case . however, due to mitf degradation, similar levels of pias <dig> becomes available also in the case of wild type mitf, leading to no difference in level of free pias <dig> to inhibit phosphorylated stat <dig> activity. thus, according to our results, the proposed mechanism is not a plausible explanation of the observed data.

discussion
the focal melanocyte regulatory module may reflect the need for co-regulation of two transcription factors. it seems to provide one type of solution for obtaining different co-regulation effects on different time scales, from the immediate effects on the activity of one transcription factor upon activation of the other, to the long term effect of sequestering and later release. because this module has components working on many different time scales, the history leading up to an event may be determinative. this may be of importance when interpreting results from experiments that operate on different time scales, such as transfection of constitutively active kinases compared to activation of pre-existing kinases.

the cross talk is going mostly one way
the asymmetry of the network, introduced by pias <dig> binding to activated stat <dig>  while most efficiently binding to non-activated mitf, yields a particular regulatory effect. we observe that in the model, stat <dig> is more affected by the activation of mitf than mitf is affected by the activation of stat <dig>  this phenomenon, which is in accordance with earlier observations  <cit> , can be elucidated from some features of the model. in the resting cell, pias <dig> is to a larger extent bound to un-phosphorylated mitf and mitfp <dig>  which are the major phosphorylation states in the resting cell. on the other hand, stat <dig> only binds pias <dig> when activated. thus, even if both transcription factors are able to alter the amount of free pias <dig>  only stat <dig> is affected by it: activated mitf does not interact with pias <dig>  and is therefore unaffected by the amount of free pias <dig>  stat <dig>  on the other hand, binds pias <dig> only in activated state, and the strength of the signal is therefore highly affected by the level of free pias <dig>  this is a mechanistic explanation for the observation that stat <dig> does not associate with pias <dig> that is already associated with mitf  <cit> .

this model cannot explain the result of experiment #26
our results indicate that it is not possible to mimic experiment  <dig> with this model. this finding contradicts the mechanism suggested in  <cit>  as an explanation for the observed data. in our opinion, these observations must either be caused by un-expected properties in the mitf mutant, and/or by un-modelled connections in the network. the latter is supported by the fact that the module modelled here is an abstraction of a small part of a vastly complex regulatory network. mechanisms not accounted for in the present model include regulation of mitf  <cit>  and upstream co-regulators in the jak-stat  <cit>  and the src-stat pathways.

the sensitivity of simulation results to parameter value perturbations
in the sensitivity analysis the model parameters were perturbed in a range from half to double their default value. some of the parameters exposed negligible effect on the simulation results under these perturbations. for instance there are no experiments that show high sensitivity to the association and dissociation constants kmp409ass, kmp409diss. a possible explanation for this is that the affinity of s <dig> phosphorylated mitf to pias <dig> is so low that pias3-mitfp <dig> is rare compared to the other pias3-mitf complexes, and modest perturbations of the association and dissociation constants does not change this situation. the mitf and stat <dig> production rates  are affecting the total amount of protein, but still none of the experiments are particularly sensitive to these parameters. the reason for this seems to be that the relative response measured in the experiments is not affected much by this total amount.

the broader context
in the skin, the major contributors to melanocyte signalling are dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes  <cit> . for mitf, the major regulatory pathways are thought to be the tgf-β and the pomc derivatives acth and α-msh signalling pathways  <cit> . the tgf-β pathway, which is often dysregulated in melanoma  <cit> , down-regulates mitf, while the α-msh pathway up-regulates mitf expression  <cit> . the up-regulation occurs via α-msh binding and activation of mc1r, which leads to camp/pka activation and activation of mapk  <cit> . thus, the effect of the mapk pathway on mitf is complex, including up-regulation, activation and tagging for degradation. for stat <dig>  in addition to the il- <dig> cytokine family, growth factors such as egf, pdgf and kitl have been reported to activate stat <dig>  <cit> . here, kitl is of special interest in melanocyte biology. in addition to being essential for melanocyte development, it has recently been reported that the hereto unidentified coupling of mc1r activation to mapk proceeds via mc1r-coupled kit activation of mapk  <cit> . with a focus on developing potential therapies toward melanoma, both mitf and stat <dig> have been implicated in neoplastic progression. mitf has been classified as a bona fide context dependent oncogene  <cit> . stat <dig> has been implicated in neoplastic progression with an increased contribution especially in metastatic melanoma  <cit> . strikingly, no spontaneous or inherited mutations have been isolated  <cit> . targeting stat <dig> is, however, feasible from both upstream and downstream elements. in addition to being a melanoma oncogene, depletion of mitf has been reported to induce arrest, senescence and cell death in melanoma identifying it as a potential target for therapy  <cit> . indeed, a pias <dig> based peptide has been developed to target both mitf and stat <dig> via a pias <dig> 23-aa mimic  <cit> .

applicability of the model
with regards to mitf and stat <dig> and their roles in melanocyte biology, it is intriguing that α-msh signalling is somewhat equivalent to kitl signalling with the additional activation of the camp/pka axis. this leads to an increase in mitf production and dual phosphorylation of both mitf and stat <dig>  likewise, α-msh signalling in melanoma predisposing mc1r rhc  mutant backgrounds, which does not elevate camp, would alone be equivalent to kitl signalling in a wild type background with regards to mitf and stat <dig>  the outcome being stat <dig> phosphorylation and mitf activation and subsequent depletion. with this in mind, the emergence of mitf's role in melanoma and its high frequency of duplication, it seems contradictory that mc1r mutants predispose individuals to this disease. it will be interesting to see if compensatory mutations in camp elevating factors such as g protein-coupled receptors  are found to be necessary for progression and if so to model the outcomes  <cit> .

special conditions like jak-stat <dig> activation duration due to socs feedback inhibition versus src-stat <dig> activation, which is not influenced by socs  <cit> , may be simulated through the model. in addition, other relevant factors such as nf-κ-b, which is also regulated by pias <dig> binding  <cit> , may be added by incorporating an nf-κ-b module. another interesting module would, for example, be gm-csf/kitl or gm-csf/α-msh signalling. gm-csf activates mapk, but has been reported to inhibit kit signalling via direct binding of csf2ra to kit  <cit> .

with this model at hand, more detailed issues in this network can be addressed. the previously posed question on which phosphorylation states of mitf are represented by the upper band interpreted to be phosphorylated mitf in western blot analysis  <cit> , is such an issue. with the ability to test different hypothesis in simulations, both the experiment design and the interpretation of the experimental results could benefit.

further work could include refinement of various parts of the model by integrated wet-lab modelling efforts. the three parts of the model that could benefit the most from structural enhancement, are the following:  the mapping function from the mitf phosphorylation states to the mitf transcriptional activity could be represented on a higher resolution level. this is needed for the model to address quantitative data with absolute values.  the production regime of mitf, pias <dig>  stat <dig> and rsk <dig> could be represented by both transcription and translation.  the enzymatic equations could be represented by michaelis-menten kinetics. all these structural changes will introduce more state variables and model parameters, thus nothing would be gained by these efforts without the generation of accurate quantitative data to pin down both the model structure and the parameter values.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have provided a mathematical model of the mitf-pias3-stat <dig> network and have mimicked a representative selection of lab experiments that explore the features of this network. the analyses of this model have revealed explanations to the observed phenomena, as well as recommended reconsideration of previously proposed explanations. this model provides a framework for further investigation of this interesting crosstalk, and can be used as a tool for experimental design and as starting point for further modelling efforts.
