BACKGROUND
visible polymorphisms provide tractable systems within which to examine the molecular basis of adaptation because of their often-simple patterns of inheritance and the general ease with which morph/allele frequencies can be estimated  <cit> . many spider species show visible variation in color and pattern  <cit> . a number of unrelated species within the theridiidae  exhibit a heritable color polymorphism. in most cases examined, the polymorphism consists of two or three morphs, as in the sister species enoplognatha ovata clerck and enoplognatha latimana hippa & oksala  <cit> . two other, distantly related species within the genus theridion have become of particular interest because they exhibit a spectacular array of color morphs. the hawaiian happy-face spider theridion grallator simon occurs in native forest on four of the hawaiian islands and displays more than  <dig> discrete abdominal color patterns  <cit>  while theridion californicum is found along the pacific coast of north-america and exhibits at least  <dig> discrete abdominal color patterns  <cit> . the morphs displayed by these species are remarkably similar, and in the case of t. grallator may have evolved repeatedly, subsequent to colonization of each of the hawaiian islands  <cit> . many of the morphs exhibited by these species are illustrated in references  <cit>  and  <cit> . the most common morphs of each species are also convergent with those displayed by enoplognatha ovata, e. latimana and some other polymorphic species in the theridiidae. in all species examined there is a common yellow morph that typically represents 60-70% of any population and that is recessive to all other morphs, with the colored  morphs displaying a dominance hierarchy that broadly reflects the extent of pigmentation  <cit> . the morphs are created from a palette of yellow, red and dark-brown  pigments laid down on a reflective background of white guanine crystals and all the pigment appears to be ommochrome based  <cit> .

these recurring patterns led oxford  <cit>  to propose that in the theridiidae there is a common ground plan for patterning and that the occurrence of shared morphs across species implies canalization of the processes by which the color patterns are generated. furthermore, studies in e. ovata, t. grallator, and t. californicum have shown that the inheritance of the color polymorphism follows a broadly mendelian pattern with segregation at a single locus with multiple alleles  <cit> . the pattern of simple mendelian inheritance is occasionally complicated by the presence of sex-limitation  in the expression of color morphs. indeed, t. grallator individuals from the island of hawaii, compared with those from maui, have experienced a shift in the mode of inheritance of the polymorphism with possibly two loci involved and some color morphs exhibiting sex limitation  <cit> . this change in the pattern of inheritance has led to the suggestion that the color polymorphism has to some extent evolved independently on different islands  <cit> .

chemical basis for spider coloration
much of the pigment-based coloration in invertebrates results from products of the ommochrome, pteridine, papiliochrome, melanin and heme synthesis pathways  <cit> . to date only ommochrome and bilin-based pigments have been identified in spiders. ommochromes, which are derivatives of the amino acid tryptophan, via kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine, are the best-known spider pigments and are responsible for a wide range of colors from yellow through red to gold and very dark brown. the usual reduced form is red/brown and the oxidized form usually yellow  <cit> . ommochromes have been the focus of considerable research in particular in the 1970s and 1980s  <cit> . more recent work on these pigments in spiders has largely been limited to color change in misumena vatia, where it appears that color change is associated with a cyclic pattern of formation and degradation of pigment granules  <cit> .

bilins, which tend to be blue or green, have been found in the form of micromatabilin in the green huntsman spider micrommata virescens   <cit> . in addition to these pigments, the purine-base guanine, a terminal excretory product in spiders, is often laid down in crystalline form in specialized guanocytes on the surface of the gut diverticula, directly beneath the hypodermis  <cit> ). the guanine crystals produce a white or silvery coloration by reflection and scattering and are therefore structural colorants. however they are frequently directly associated with pigment-based colors, either contributing to the overall color pattern or acting as a reflective layer beneath pigmented areas  <cit> .

melanin is found, with a variety of structures, ubiquitously throughout the tree of life  <cit>  and commonly plays a role in defense and isolation of infections. melanin has however not been reported as a pigment in spiders  <cit> . although identified in some mites  <cit> , carotenoid pigments have also not been detected in spiders  <cit> . perhaps most surprising is the apparent absence of pteridine-based pigments. the pteridine pathway is found in both plants and animals and a key compound in the pathway, tetrahydrobiopterin, acts as an essential cofactor in the degradation of phenylalanine and the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, melatonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine  <cit> . pteridine and ommochrome pigments form the basis of the visible eye-color variants of drosophila and much of the variation in butterfly wing patterns, and have consequently been central to the development of genetics itself  <cit> . indeed the plethora of observed eye-color mutants in drosophila results from the complex spectral interactions of pteridine and ommochrome pigments. given the use of guanine as a colorant in spiders, it is also interesting to note that this is the key substrate for the pteridine pathway . finally, many pigment proteins contain heme groups or result from conjugates of heme-containing compounds   <cit> .

the parallel evolution of genetically based adaptive changes amongst both unrelated species and the highly structured populations of these spiders  makes these systems ideal for examining evolution under balancing selection. our ultimate aim is to elucidate the molecular basis of the evolutionary changes that have led to the parallel evolution of similar coloration in these species. however, a necessary step in this process is the determination of the pigment synthesis pathways that are present in these spiders and the gene sequences associated with them. subsequently candidate genes associated with the allelic basis of the color polymorphism or that are differentially expressed among color morphs can be identified. the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has permitted rapid profiling and de novo assembly of the complete set of expressed mrna sequences in a specific tissue or whole organism . in addition to providing information on the structure of expressed gene transcripts , the digital nature of rna-seq facilitates the determination of both relative transcript expression levels within a tissue or organism and the differential expression of transcripts among tissues or experimental treatments. using data generated through a combination of rna-seq and the sequencing of normalized cdna libraries to compensate for the under-sampling and poor assembly of rarer transcripts, we report on the near-complete whole-body expressed transcriptomes of two species of color-polymorphic spider, theridion californicum and t. grallator. this represents the most extensive genomic data set for spiders so far available. we report on the gene complement of these species and highlight gene families that appear to have experienced expansion in the lineage leading to spiders. in particular we identify pigment-pathway genes in these spiders and we secondarily examine these, as well as the larger gene set, for evidence of differential expression between the common  yellow  morph and colored  morphs.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly of two spider transcriptomes
the transcriptomes of the two spider species, theridion grallator and t. californicum, were assembled from a combination of rna-seq and normalized cdna illumina short-read data. the annotated contigs are available as additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> . the trinity based assemblies returned a large number of contigs  clustered into a number of components  and the numbers of reads and contigs at each assembly step is outlined in table  <dig>  although all contigs > 100 bp were retained by trinity, here we report the statistics and counts for all contigs > 200 bp and refer the reader to tables  <dig> and  <dig> for full count information. the assembly for t. californicum consisted of  <dig>  contigs  in  <dig>  components and that for t. grallator of  <dig>  contigs in  <dig>  components. the maximum contig length for t. californicum was  <dig>  bp and for t. grallator was  <dig>  bp . the mean contig length for t. californicum was 606 bp and for t. grallator 601 bp and the n <dig> contig lengths were 901 bp and 926 bp respectively. the frequency distribution of contig lengths for each assembly is given in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  the large number of contigs between  <dig> and 200 bp in length can be assumed to consist of both real short transcripts  and many contigs that represent non-overlapping fragments of single genes - greatly inflating gene counts. the extent of this fragmentation was explored by using the  <dig>  genes of the uniprotkb drosophila melanogaster proteome as a target for blastx searches with each of the spider transcriptomes. of the  <dig>  t. grallator contigs >100 bp that generated blast hits to d. melanogaster genes  <dig>   were unique best hits . when only contigs > 200 bp were considered  <dig>  of  <dig>   hits were unique. similarly, for t. californicum contigs > 100 bp in length  <dig>  of  <dig>   of hits were unique and for contigs > 200 bp,  <dig>  of  <dig>   were unique. this increase in the proportion of unique hits  when contigs 100–199 bp are excluded indicates that contigs of this length are likely highly fragmented.

functional annotation and filtering of putative contaminant organisms
the subset of putative protein-coding transcripts present in the assemblies was identified using two approaches. first, all the transcripts were subject to blastx homology searches against the entire ncbi non-redundant nr protein database. for t. californicum  <dig>  contigs > 200 bp  and for t. grallator  <dig>  contigs > 200 bp  had at least one blast hit with an expected e-value smaller than 1×10- <dig> . examination of the blast hits indicated that a significant proportion of the contigs in both species were likely to originate not from the spider per se but from parasitic, commensal and environmental contaminants . the contigs with blastx hits were therefore filtered into two sets based upon the blastx hit species tag, using the program megan  <dig> <cit> . all contigs that were assigned to the metazoa  were designated as “spider” contigs and all others “non-spider”. this resulted in a final spider blastx-positive set of  <dig>  contigs > 200 bp  for t. californicum and  <dig>  contigs > 200 bp  for t. grallator . in other words,  <dig> % of the blastx-positive t. californicum contigs  are likely not to correspond to spider genes. the same is true of a remarkable  <dig> % of t. grallator contigs . this resulted in the final number of spider blastx-positive components  between the two species being only 8% different . relative abundances and taxonomic distributions of the non-spider taxa at the phylum level and for bacterial classes are given in additional file 3: tables s <dig> and s <dig>  most of the non-spider taxa are bacteria or fungi indicating a rich microbiome that is more complex in the tropical species. the blast2go annotation pipeline rejected  <dig>  t. californicum and  <dig>  t. grallatorblastx-positive contigs because the minimum hsp length was shorter than  <dig> aa. overall, the e-values of the blastx hits were very low with  <dig>   of t. californicum and  <dig>   of t. grallator hits  having an e-value <1×10- <dig> .

the top  <dig> taxa generating blastx hits to the spider contigs are illustrated in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  although this distribution partly reflects the biased composition of the ncbi nr database,  <dig> of the top  <dig> taxa were invertebrates, including three arachnids – the deer tick ixodes scapularis , the gulf coast tick amblyomma maculatum , and the western black-widow spider latrodectus hesperus . . the overall distributions of the top blast hits were highly similar for both spider species . the blastx hits were used for mapping the contigs and subsequently assigning gene ontology  annotations using blast2go pro. in total go annotations were assigned to  <dig>   t. californicum and  <dig>   t. grallator contigs .

the blastx homology searches  indicate the presence of a large protein-coding gene set in the two species – ca.  <dig>  genes . since the public databases currently contain relatively little gene-sequence information for spiders, we also employed a second approach to coding-gene identification using markov-model prediction based upon geneid <cit> , as implemented in trinity. only open reading frames orfs greater than  <dig> aa  were considered. this analysis identified a similar number of putative genes to the blastx analyses:  <dig>  components  in t. californicum and  <dig>  components in t. grallator. a detailed analysis of the overlap among the various protein-coding gene set predictions is given in supplemental section  <dig>  and additional file 3: figure s <dig>  the results of the markov-orf prediction suggest that the two spider species might have ca.  <dig> % more protein-coding genes than predicted by blastx homology alone – i.e. at least  <dig>  coding genes. the protein coding transcriptome size was estimated to be between ca.  <dig>  mbp to  <dig>  mbp and the gc content is low: t. californicum is  <dig> % and for t. grallator  <dig> % .

comparative genomics and generation of orthologous gene clusters
the most parsimonious reconstruction of gene family gain and loss is presented on the recovered phylogeny in figure  <dig>  the spider gene data was based upon the sets of markov-predicted orfs . the phylogeny was supported by high bootstrap values . our gene family evolution results are largely congruent with those presented by grbíc et al. <cit>  in which the genome of the mite tetranychus urticae was described, and any discrepancies are likely due to recent updates of several of the predicted protein datasets. in our analysis, the ancestor of the arachnids had  <dig> gene families. the lineage leading to the mite t. urticae gained  <dig> gene families while apparently losing  <dig> . t. urticae represents the smallest arthropod genome sequenced, at ~90 mb, and is of atypical size for arachnids. in contrast, the unfinished genome of the tick ixodes scapularis, also a member of the acari, is much larger   <cit> . it is important to note that in these analyses, and also in the pigment-pathway associated gene search, that when we state that a gene  was not detected this does not necessarily mean that the gene is absent; it may merely be that we failed to detect the contig because of weak expression, low sequence similarity, lack of expression in adult females, or environment specific expression.

regarding the araneae, the lineage leading from the arachnid ancestor to the genus theridion  accumulated  <dig>  novel gene families while apparently only loosing  <dig>  nearly half of the genes in these novel gene families  could not be assigned to gene ontology  domains  and did not receive go annotations. between the full transcriptomes of the two theridion species sequenced here,  <dig> unique go terms were assigned by blast2go. of these,  <dig> were present in the t. californicum annotations; each of these was shared with t. grallator. the t. grallator transcriptome contained four unique go terms: go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig> , and go: <dig> . the latter two are associated with the protein ufm  <dig>  a ubiquitin-like protein. the nearly complete overlap of go annotations between the two species further validates the completeness of our transcriptome data. in order to characterize the spider transcriptome functionally, we explored the level ii and level iii go annotations for each of the three go domains in terms of frequency with which each go-term was assigned to the dataset. we also included the set of araneae-specific genes  in order to attempt to highlight any functional differences that may be enriched within this group. for brevity, these results are discussed in the supplementary material alongside the accompanying supplementary section  <dig>  and additional file 3: figures s5-s <dig> 

pigment pathway-associated genes in t. californicum and t. grallator
a principle aim of this study was to identify and characterize expressed pigment-pathway-associated genes in t. californicum and t. grallator: 1) to clarify which pigment pathways are expressed; and 2), to identify candidate loci responsible for the allelic basis of the color polymorphism. homologues of known pigment-process-associated proteins from drosophila melanogaster were sought in the full transcriptome assemblies of both t. californicum and t. grallator. putative homologues were detected to  <dig> out of  <dig> d. melanogaster proteins . of these,  <dig> were confirmed as likely homologues by reciprocal best hit . again, it is important to note that absence of evidence for a contig is not evidence of absence of a gene. the pigment pathway genes were divided into five broad categories of pathway: heme, melanin, rhodopsin/carotenoid, pteridine and ommochrome . .

white/scarlet/brown complex not distinguishable by rbh.

heme
of nine d. melanogaster heme genes examined, eight were confirmed by rbh. the products of the eight confirmed genes are all involved in heme synthesis  <cit> , confirming that the heme pathway, known to be highly-conserved across the tree-of-life  <cit> , is largely intact in these spiders. the gene for heme oxygenase  was not detected by rbh; because ho catalyses the degradation of heme into biliverdin  <cit> , its apparent absence supports the notion that these spiders do not produce bilin pigments.

melanin
only seven out of  <dig> melanin-associated genes  were confirmed by rbh. melanin pigments have not been reported in spiders  <cit> , although their role in parasite encapsulation in spiders has been assumed  <cit> . key genes associated with melanin pigmentation in d. melanogaster were not detectable by rbh e.g. spn27a, which regulates the melanization cascade in d. melanogaster  <cit> ; yellow-f  that converts dopachrome to  <dig> -dihydroxyindole  <cit> ; nor ebony   <cit> . the lack of a melanin pigmentation pathway, also implies that spiders do not produce the yellow papiliochrome pigments that are typical of swallowtail butterflies as these depend upon both the melanin and ommochrome pathways  <cit> .

rhodopsin/carotenoid
although not structurally related, we group rhodopsin and the carotenoid pigments together here simply because rhodopsins are intimately bound to the carotenoid derived cofactor retinal . only three out of  <dig>  of the rhodopsin/carotenoid-associated genes were identified by rbh. santa-maria and ninaa are important in general carotenoid metabolism  <cit>  and kh <dig> contains rna helicase domains  <cit> .

no genes strongly associated with vision were identified– a testament to the “poor vision” characteristic of most spiders families.

pteridine
nine  of  <dig> pteridine-associated genes were identified by rbh . although the pteridine biosynthesis pathway starts with guanosine triphosphate  as its substrate, the homology search also included key genes from the de novo purine synthesis pathway through which gtp is generated   <cit> . we detected two genes whose products are involved in purine nucleotide salvage: adenine phosphoribosyl transferase, aprt; and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, hgprt . genes for all key de novo purine synthesis enzymes that were searched for were detected including the classic d. melanogaster eye-color loci raspberry   and burgundy . furthermore, all key enzymes leading to the production of h4biopterin  <cit>  were detected: punch ), which catalyzes the production of dihydroneopterin triphosphate, h2-ntp; purple ) which eliminates the phosphate groups yielding 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin, 6-ptp; and sepiapterin reductase ) which yields h <dig> biopterin  <cit> . the conservation of the h4biopterin pathway in spiders is not surprising given that the pathway is shared by plants and animals  <cit> . however, the detection of the genes henna )  <cit>  and clot, a thioredoxin-like protein  <cit> , suggest the possibility that the yellow pigment sepiapterin and orange/red drosopterin pigments could be present. in addition, the gene maroon-like was also detected. this encodes a protein with a molybdopterin cofactor sulphurase activity and may regulate the activities of aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase  <cit> .

ommochrome
of the  <dig> ommochrome-associated genes that were searched for,  <dig> were identified table 4). neither cardinal  nor zeste   <cit>  was detected. the two key enzymes of the ommochrome synthesis pathway sensu stricto – vermillion , and cinnabar   – were clearly detected. other enzymes known to be involved, including kynurenine formamidase   <cit>  and phenoxazinone synthase   <cit>  were not deteced . overall xthough, our results confirm that the ommochrome pathway is expressed and intact in these spiders.

ommochrome and pteridine transport-associated genes
abc-type membrane transporters. the white, brown and scarlet genes encode subunits of abc-type membrane transporters. the white and scarlet subunits combine to form an ommochrome precursor transporter and the white and brown subunits combine to form a pteridine precursor transporter  <cit> . although the white gene was identified by rbh in both spiders, the brown and scarlet genes were only identified at the level of the one-way blast and therefore their presence cannot be confirmed, although they are likely to be present.

tryptophan transport. the gene karmoisin was confirmed by rbh. it has been suggested that the product of this gene, which is probably orthologous to mammalian tat <dig>  is a tryptophan cell-membrane transporter and is therefore essential to ommochrome biosynthesis  <cit> .

endosomal and vesicle trafficking. the four subunits of the ap- <dig> complex  were all detected by rbh or blast2go annotation: carmine , garnet , orange  and ruby . we also detected two genes that encode clathrin heavy-chain peptides: deep orange and light. in addition we also detected the bloc- <dig> component pink , the hops component carnation, the rab gtpase lightoid  which has been implicated in trafficking to lysosome-related organelles  <cit> , and claret – a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that acts with lightoid <cit> .

relative and differential expression of genes and isoforms in t. grallator and t. californicum
the rna-seq reads for each spider species were mapped back to the assembled transcriptome data so that both overall relative expression levels, and differential expression, of genes could be examined between yellow and colored morphs. of the three most highly expressed genes from each of the two spider species,  <dig> out of  <dig> show closest homology to genes from other arachnids and actin is among the most highly expressed genes in both species.  and s <dig> ).

differential expression  between the read pools from yellow and from colored individuals was examined by comparing the read mappings between the two groups using edger  <cit> . since no true biological replicates were present in our data, the data sets were normalized against a set of  <dig> rbh-verified drosophila melanogaster house-keeping  genes. the hk genes were expressed at similar levels in the yellow and colored groups of each species. the average absolute difference in the number of reads mapped to the hk genes in the yellow and colored categories  for t. californicum was  <dig> ×10- <dig> reads, and for the t. grallator was  <dig> ×10- <dig> reads. in comparison, the set of pigment-associated genes  had average absolute differences in the number of mapped reads  of  <dig> ×10- <dig> for t. californicum  and  <dig> ×10- <dig> for t. grallator . in order to test for 'statistical significance’ the common dispersion was also estimated using the set of hk genes. even so, any interpretation of significance in de among the samples here must be treated with extreme caution, especially when the entire transcriptome dataset is considered. the most differentially expressed components for each species are given in additional file 3: tables s <dig> and s <dig>  nonetheless, our de analysis suggested that when t. californicum color was compared to t. californicum yellow,  <dig> components  were “significantly” over-expressed and  <dig> were under-expressed . when the same comparison was made for t. grallator,  <dig> genes were “significantly” over-expressed and  <dig> under-expressed. the reason for the discrepancy in the magnitude of these numbers is not clear, however it may well be a simple consequence of fewer individuals entering the sequencing pool for t. grallator, generating greater variance in this species’ data. examination of the differences in go-term assignment percentages between the entire transcriptome and the de gene sets  also revealed little agreement between the two species with respect to de go-term enrichment, highlighting the need for caution in interpreting our transcriptome-wide de assessments.

the identification of reciprocal homologues among both the t. grallator and t. californicum hk gene-set and the pigment-associated genes, permitted a more robust analysis for this sub-set of that data than was possible for the transcriptome-wide data. we therefore focused on de patterns for those pigment genes with measurable expression  to identify shared changes in expression among colored versus yellow samples of both species . the log <dig> fold-change for color compared to yellow is plotted in decreasing order from positive to negative. no gene showed statistically significant de . the use of only two  biological replicates yields little statistical power. in lieu of “statistical significance” for this data, some confidence in the extent of de was obtained by examining the standard deviation  in de among the hk genes; taking any pigment-gene log <dig> fold-change more than or less than  <dig> sd around the hk mean to be likely to be meaningful . of  <dig> pigment-associated genes examined , three were down-regulated  and  <dig> were up-regulated . six genes showed a log <dig> fold-change >  <dig>  , most notably these genes included the guanine nucleotide exchange factor claret  and the abc transporter white . both of these proteins are involved in pigment granules formation and trafficking. another, notably up-regulated gene was phosphoribosylamidotransferase , which is a key enzyme in purine synthesis and is therefore upstream in the pteridine biosynthetic process .

discussion
the transcriptome of each of two species of color-polymorphic theridiid spider was sequenced using illumina technology and assembled using the assembler trinity. by sequencing pools of individuals at great depth and by combining rna-seq libraries and sequencing libraries derived from normalized-cdna  libraries we have been able to reconstruct the transcriptome of each species with apparent completeness. the great utility of rna-seq data comes from its ability to capture digital gene expression information in the form of relative read coverage. consequently, rna-seq is biased towards generating sequence from the most highly-expressed contigs. since many contigs are likely to be rare, with perhaps less than 1% of expressed genes accounting for 50% of cellular mrna  <cit> , a typical rna-seq experiment will fail to record sequence from many transcripts. by using both ncdna-derived data and rna-seq data we have been able both to assemble rare transcripts into contigs and tentatively examine de. the contribution of the ncdna data to the assemblies was clear as only 70-80% of the rna-seq reads mapped back to the metazoan blastx-positive components . however, it is also likely that the use of ncdna resulted in the detection of a large and diverse spider “meta-transcriptome” – an inventory of expressed genes from organisms associated with the spiders . the fascinating discrepancy in the proportion of non-spider sequences between the temperate, mainland species t. californicum and the tropical, island species t. grallator will be explored elsewhere.

our transcriptome assemblies are naturally not complete in terms of sampling the full diversity of genes and their various isoforms or in their full-length assembly into contigs. since the detection of gene transcripts by transcriptome sequencing depends upon the expression of those transcripts, those transcripts that are only expressed at certain life-stages will be missed. since adult female spiders will contain developing eggs our use of this life stage will naturally also include some transcripts from early development. accepting the absence of some life-stage specific transcripts, several lines of evidence indicate that our gene sampling is otherwise quite comprehensive. first, the numbers of coding genes predicted, and other characteristics of the assemblies, were consistent between the two species , with the number of metazoan blastx-positive components  only differing by 8% . second, the distributions of the top hit taxa and associated e-values  from the blastx homology searches, as well as all go-term assignment analyses , were remarkably consistent across both species. furthermore, when go-terms were assigned to gene families the two species shared  <dig> of  <dig>  unique go terms. third, the cegma analysis  indicated that 99%  and 98%  of the  <dig> cegs were at least partially represented.

the transcriptomes of t. californicum and t. grallator contain a large number of contigs that represent components or “genes” . these components include both protein-coding genes  i.e. 5’utr, 3′utr, and transcribed introns) and transcribed non-coding sequences. the non-protein-coding genes  likely comprise more than 50% of the spider transcriptome but we have not attempted to characterize these here. the set of putative protein-coding components is however impressive and we estimate that these species express at least  <dig>   protein-coding genes and probably in excess of  <dig>  . theridion spiders, assuming that t. californicum and t. grallator are representative of the genus, therefore appear to have more protein-coding genes than the well-characterized two-spotted spider mite tetranychus urticae  and a similar number to homo sapiens  <cit> . for t. californicum and t. grallator only ca.  <dig> % of the markov-predicted genes  had no known homology. given the large number of araneae-specific gene families  this low percentage of genes with no known homologues may seem surprising. however, many of these homologues are likely to stem from the fact that the relatively few protein and est sequences derived from spiders and available in public databases are biased towards those that are specific to spiders i.e. venom and silk gland est-sequencing experiments , and venom-gland sequences from other organisms. of  <dig> curated venom peptide sequences downloaded from arachnoserver  <cit> , t. californicum had  <dig> and t. grallator had only  <dig>  rbh blast matches to diverse arachnid venom peptides , so if many theridion genes do code for venom peptides then these might be mostly unknown. until the reads/transcripts can be mapped back to a reference genome it is not possible to be sure about the numbers of theridion genes. our transcripts are de novo assembled and will include erroneously concatenated transcripts and single transcripts that have been split into separate components. fragmentation is likely to be common for highly-repetitive silk genes, for example and we have demonstrated that short contigs  are likely to contain many fragments of single genes). however, this is unlikely to detract from the fact that the gene catalogue for these spiders, the first comprehensive list for any spider, is undoubtedly large.

in this study, pooling individuals placed a constraint upon our ability to measure de between the  yellow and  colored morphs of these spiders and hence to detect gene pathways associated with the color polymorphism. without true biological replicates, estimation of the coefficient of variation and hence testing statistical significance becomes impossible. we attempted to circumvent this limitation by borrowing from microarray approaches, normalizing read counts and estimating common dispersion from a defined set of house-keeping  genes. even so, over such a large set of genes this approach was still of limited utility . consequently, we chose to focus on the subset of ommochrome- and pteridine-associated genes identified by rbh against d. melanogaster homologues in a survey of pigment-pathway associated genes. since homology was established among the pigment genes and among the hk genes we were able to use the two species as biological replicates, and although statistical power was still weak for significance testing, both species showed a marked and congruent increase in expression in pigment-associated genes in colored individuals. this result is logical since it is known that the yellow form is double recessive with respect to all the patterned, colored morphs. as such, the recessive yellow alleles would be expected to show lower expression levels for associated pigment genes when compared to the dominant color alleles, and this one-tailed expectation is corroborated by both ommonchrome and pteridine pigment pathway genes . these results are also important because they demonstrate that many pigmentation genes are differentially expressed in adult spiders i.e. expression is not restricted to younger instars, perhaps because pigment granules are constantly being cycled  <cit> . the implication of a role for pteridines in the color polymorphism of these spiders is also very significant because: 1) pteridine pigments have not been described in spiders  <cit> , and 2) because the involvement of this pathway provides an intriguing link between stored guanine and overlying yellow, red and very dark-brown pigments, which have been assumed to be exclusively ommochrome-derived. together these components interact to generate the various color morphs  <cit> . of course, the mere presence of the pteridine pathway genes does not necessarily mean that the animals generate pteridine pigments in any appreciable amount, even if it is suggestive of this.

this homology-based approach to pathway-gene identification works because of the deep evolutionary conservation of the pathways associated with the production of many animal pigments. indeed pigments are often derived from the waste or terminal products of key metabolic processes such as heme  <cit>  and guanine  <cit> , or metabolites generated during the production and recycling of the cofactor h4biopterin  <cit> . nonetheless, the pathways and the enzymes recruited into various roles do vary and the assumption that spider homologues to d. melanogaster enzymes should have equivalent roles is not trivial, especially given that these organisms probably had a last common ancestor some 725 ma  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have generated an exhaustive assembly of the transcriptomes of two species of theridiid spider and been able to identify homologues to an array of pigment-pathway genes from d. melanogaster. this confirmed the presence of genes from the pathways of known pigments  and indicated the presence of previously unknown pathways in spiders that may be implicated in the color patterning and polymorphism exhibited by these species . obvious future work includes the confirmation of the presence these pigments by mass-spectrometry and the verification of putatively differentially expressed genes by qpcr. our analyses also indicated the likely absence of some pigment pathways. most notable is the apparent lack of key enzymes associated with melanization in spiders. although there has been much work on the role of eumelanin in pigmentation and innate defense  in insects and crustaceans  <cit> , this study exemplifies how little is known about innate immunity in spiders . arachnid immunity is likely to be a fruitful avenue of research that, like studies of silk and venom, promises far-reaching medical, agricultural and technological applications. this first comprehensive gene catalogue represents a valuable baseline genomics resource for future research into spider genetics and represents a first and fundamental step towards understanding, and eventually identifying, the genetic basis of the incredible color polymorphism and patterning displayed by these animals.
