BACKGROUND
promising technologies are continuing to be developed for the conversion of cellulosic biomass into value-added commodities via microbial fermentation  <cit> . in order to be an economically viable process, however, anaerobic rather than aerobic microbial fermentation will most likely be used to produce redox neutral and reduced products. the anaerobic process will achieve a high substrate to product conversion yield since substrates often account for a significant portion of the production cost. to this end, metabolic pathway engineering has been used to optimize carbon flow from biomass-derived sugars to final products at high yields through manipulation of enzyme levels by over-expression, addition and/or deletion of target pathway genes  <cit> . nevertheless, the insufficient supply of reducing power nadh  equivalent output of sugar catabolism remains a significant challenge for the production of reduced products from redox neutral biomass derived sugars under anaerobic conditions.

most, if not all, microbial species can obtain a fixed number of nadh from any given carbon source under anaerobic conditions . while limited, these nadh outputs provide the reducing power for the reduction of metabolic intermediates into fermentation products. in nature, with the limited nadh available from catabolism, some microorganisms have evolved multiple fermentation pathways to produce a mixture of redox neutral, oxidized, and reduced products to achieve a balanced redox in the absence of a suitable terminal electron acceptor. for example, under anaerobic conditions, e. coli carries out a mixed acid fermentation using the two nadh from glycolysis, producing oxidized , redox neutral , and reduced  products  <cit> . genetic engineering has been successfully used to divert carbon flow and the reducing power  to produce redox neutral products, such as lactic acid, with a 100 % theoretical yield  <cit> . nevertheless, nadh availability from glucose catabolism often limits the yield of reduced products by anaerobic e. coli fermentation  <cit> .

increasing nadh availability, at least in theory, will accordingly increase the yield of reduced product via anaerobic fermentation. in prior studies, alteration of the nadh/nad ratios by growing cells on carbon sources of various oxidative states  <cit> , or through supplementation of alternative electron acceptors  <cit> , did indeed increase the proportion of reduced products from mixed acid fermentation of e. coli. in addition, berríos-rivera  <cit>  increased the intracellular nadh availability two-fold through heterologous expression of a nad+-dependent formate dehydrogenase  from candida boidinii in e. coli, which resulted in a significant shift to reduced product  accumulation and a dramatic increase in the ethanol-to-acetate ratio  <cit> . furthermore, cirino et al.  <cit>  increased the nadh output of glucose catabolism by using an e. coli mutant with an anaerobic functional pyruvate dehydrogenase . improved xylitol  yield was achieved from xylose reduction using the nadh output of glucose metabolism by this mutant.

previously, we engineered e. coli sz <dig>  a strain with a doubled reducing power output through anaerobic expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase , establishing a homoethanol pathway   <cit> . subsequently, sz <dig> was engineered for reduction of xylose to xylitol  using the reducing power of glucose catabolism by: 1) deleting the alcohol dehydrogenase  gene; 2) deleting the glucose-specific pts permease complex  to remove catabolic repression and allow simultaneous glucose and xylose uptake; and 3) expressing the aldose reductase gene  from c. boidinii  <cit> . the resulting strain, ai <dig> , achieved a xylose to xylitol conversion ratio of 1: <dig> , and a yield of  <dig>  xylitol  per glucose catabolized, with acetate as a minor by-product.

in this study, we report further engineering of e. coli ai <dig> with increased nadh output from glucose catabolism for effective reduction of xylose to xylitol by: 1) completely blocking xylose from entering the pentose phosphate pathway through deletion of genes encoding for xylose isomerase  and xylulokinase ; 2) activation of an anaerobic tca  cycle through anaerobic expression of the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon, which encodes for succinate dehydrogenase , the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex , and succinyl-coa synthetase . the resulting strain, ai <dig> , achieved a xylose-to-xylitol conversion ratio of 1: <dig>  a yield of  <dig> xylitol per glucose catabolized, and lacked acetate by-product accumulation.

genetic methods
standard methods were used for plasmid construction, transformation, electroporation, and pcr  <cit> . chromosomal gene deletions were constructed using procedures developed by posfai et al.  <cit>  and datsenko and wanner  <cit> . briefly, hybrid primer pairs were designed as follows: part of the primer is complementary to the deletion target gene and part complementary to the antibiotic cassette  of pkd <dig>  <cit> . the amplified dna, using these primer pairs and pkd <dig> as the template, was purified and electroporated into e. coli ai <dig> or its derivative  using a micropulser . as a result, the target gene was replaced by the frt-kan-frt cassette through homologous recombination , resulting in kanamycin-resistant colonies. after streak-plate purification, the isolated colonies were verified by pcr analysis. the antibiotic marker cassette  that was integrated onto the chromosome was then removed through frt site-specific recombination via a flipase .

transcriptional fusion of the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon
the pflbp6-sdhcdab-sucabcd transcriptional fusion  was constructed using previously described procedures  <cit> . hybrid primers were designed as follows : the integration primer  <dig> consists of 45 bp corresponding to the − <dig> to −174 bp upstream region of sdhc, accompanied by a 20 bp sequence corresponding to primer  <dig> of pkd4; the integration primer  <dig> consists of 45 bp corresponding to + <dig> to + <dig> of the sdhc coding sequence, followed by the 16 bp ribosomal binding site of pflb and a 20 bp pflbp <dig> promoter sequence. a frt-kan-frt-pflbp6-pflbrbs product was amplified by pcr using the hybrid primer pair and psd <dig> as the template, which contains the pflbp <dig> promoter and an upstream fnr-box  derived from e. coli b  <cit> . following purification, the amplified product  was electroporated into e. coli ai <dig> . the resulting kanamycin-resistant recombinant colonies contained the transcriptional fusion of the fnr box, pflbp <dig> promoter, pflb ribosomal binding site, and the coding sequence of the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon . after verification of this chromosomal gene fusion by analysis of the pcr products, the antibiotic marker  was removed from the chromosome with the pft-a encoded flp recombinase as described previously.fig.  <dig> engineering a homoxylitol pathway with an anaerobically active pyruvate dehydrogenase and tca cycle. a nadh output of aerobic glucose catabolism; b replacing the promoter of the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon with an anaerobically functional promoter pflbp6; c homoxylitol pathway with anaerobically active pyruvate dehydrogenase and tca cycle but without active pentose phosphate pathway. symbols: the dashed line in a indicates the step is not active under anaerobic condition; the prohibition sign in c indicates the step was blocked by deletion of the gene; arca, aerobic regulator binding box; fnr, anaerobic regulator binding box; pflbp <dig>  a promoter of pflb . genes and abbreviations: pdh, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; tca, tricarboxylic acid cycle; sdhcdab-sucabcd operon, an eight gene operon that encodes for three enzymes: succinate dehydrogenase , the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex , and succinyl-coa synthetase ; xyla, xylose isomerase gene; xylb, xylulose kinase gene



enzymatic assays
bacterial cells were grown  to mid-log phase in 250 ml flasks containing 50 ml mineral salts broth supplemented with 50 mm succinate or α-ketoglutarate. these cells were pelleted, resuspended either in 10 ml 1× tris buffer  or potassium phosphate buffer , cooled on ice for 20 min, and sonicated  <dig> times  using a sonifier cell distributor w- <dig> . after centrifugation at 4 °c , the sonicated cell broth supernatant was used as crude extract for the assays. the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase assay was performed using the following method  <cit> : 650 μl of tris buffer  and 150 μl of each of the following 10× components were added to a  <dig>  ml quartz cuvette: α-ketoglutarate potassium salt , 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide , coenzyme a , l-cysteine hydrochloride . the reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of the crude extract, with the absorbance read at 363 nm for 5 min using a uv-2401pc uv–vis recording spectrophotometer . all components without α-ketoglutarate potassium salt were used as the blank. one unit of enzyme activity was calculated as micromoles of 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide reduced per minute per mg of cell dry mass. the succinate dehydrogenase assay was performed using the following method  <cit> :  <dig>  ml of potassium phosphate buffer  and 30 μl of each of the following 10× components were added to a  <dig>  ml quartz cuvette: potassium cyanide ,  <dig> -dichlorophenol indophenol  , phenazine methosulfate , disodium succinate . the reaction was initiated by adding 30 μl of the crude extract, with the absorbance read at 600 nm for 8 min. all components without disodium succinate were used as the blank. one unit of enzyme activity was calculated as micromoles of dcip reduced per minute per mg of cell dry mass. assays were performed in triplicate.

nadh/nad assay
the nadh/nad concentrations were analyzed using adapted methods of wimpenny and firth  <cit> . bacterial cells were grown to ~ <dig>  od <dig> in lb broth  containing 2 % glucose at 37 °c under aerobic and oxygen limiting conditions. these cells were pelleted, and either treated with 300 μl hcl  for nad extraction or with 300 μl koh  for nadh extraction. the cells were then incubated at 50 °c for 10 min, cooled to 4 °c, and then neutralized by adding 300 μl either 100 mm naoh  or 100 mm hcl . after centrifugation, the supernatants were used for the nadh/nad assays which were performed in a  <dig>  ml cuvette as follows: 400 μl mixed solution  containing equal amount of 3-- <dig> -diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide , edta , tris , and 95 % ethanol; 300 μl h2o; 200 μl phenazine ethosulfate ; and 50 μl sample supernatant. the reaction was initiated by adding 50 μl yeast alcohol dehydrogenase ii , and the absorbance was read at 570 nm for 5 min using a uv-2401pc uv–vis recording spectrophotometer . all components except ethanol were used as the blank. all assays were performed in triplicate.

quantitative real-time pcr
e. coli sz <dig> and its derivatives were grown to ~ <dig>  od <dig> in 250 ml screw-cap flasks containing 100 ml mineral salts media broth supplemented with either 50 mm glucose, 50 mm succinate, or 50 mm α-ketoglutarate . bacterial cells  were pelleted at 4 °c, resuspended by vortexing in 1 ml tris-edta buffer , and mixed with 5 μl of 10 % sds at 25 °c. from the cell suspension, 100 μl was extracted and total rna was isolated using the purelink rna mini kit  as described for bacterial cells. extracted rna was treated with rq <dig> rnase-free dnase  to remove residual chromosomal dna. the rna was then used for cdna synthesis and qpcr analysis of sdhcdab-sucabcd expression using the methods described previously  <cit> .

fermentations
for anaerobic cell growth and fermentations, the culture were inoculated in media that became essentially anaerobic as the growing cells consumed the small amount of oxygen present in the media, rather than by inoculating cells into anaerobic media under strictly anaerobic conditions. specifically, seed cultures were prepared by inoculating a single colony from a fresh plate into 50 ml mineral salts broth containing 2 % glucose  and incubating  to ~ <dig> - <dig>  od <dig>  after centrifugation, cell suspensions were used to inoculate  250 ml screw-cap flasks containing 100 ml mineral salts medium supplemented with 5 g l− <dig> glucose, 15 g l− <dig> xylose and 100 μl kanamycin. the flasks were then sealed by rubber caps. the fermentations were carried out in triplicate at 30 °c, 100 rpm shaking, and supplementation of 20 μl kanamycin every 24 h to maintain the plasmid. samples were taken every 24 h for analysis of cell mass and concentration of sugars and fermentation products.

resting cell fermentation
methods were adapted from previously described procedures  <cit> . seed cultures were prepared by inoculating a single colony from a fresh plate into 100 ml mineral salts medium broth containing 2 % glucose, 1 % xylose, and 100 μl kanamycin and then incubated  until ~ <dig> - <dig>  od <dig>  after centrifugation, cells were inoculated  into 250 ml screw-cap flasks containing 50 ml modified mineral media  supplemented with 5 g l− <dig> glucose, 20 g l− <dig> xylose, and 50 μl chloramphenicol . resting cell cultures were maintained at 30 °c and 100 rpm shaking for 48 h. samples were taken every 24 h for analysis of cell mass and the concentration of sugars and fermentation products  <cit> .

analyses
cell mass was estimated by measuring the optical density at 550 nm  using a unico <dig> spectrophotometer with a round culture tube  as a cuvette  <cit> . the concentrations of sugars and fermentation products were determined by using high performance liquid chromatography  equipped with dual λ absorbance and refractive index detectors. products were separated by using a bio-rad hpx 87h column with 4 mm h2so <dig> as the mobile phase   <cit> .

RESULTS
deletion of the xylb gene improved the xylose to xylitol conversion ratio
e. coli ai <dig>  was previously engineered for the reduction of xylose to xylitol using the nadh output from glucose catabolism. the fermentation results of ai <dig> suggested that significant amounts of xylose were metabolized through the pentose phosphate pathway without being reduced to xylitol, representing a significant “substrate loss”  <cit> . further analysis showed that the metabolized xylose was at least partially converted into acetate as a by-product  <cit>  . to prevent xylose loss and minimize acetate by-product accumulation, the xylb gene encoding for xylulokinase was deleted from ai <dig>  resulting in strain ai <dig> 

xylose is still expected to be transported into ai <dig> cells via the xyle transporter, converted to d-xylulose by xyla, but blocked from further metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway because xylb deletion blocks d-xylulose to d-xylulose- <dig> phosphate conversion . to evaluate the impact of the xylb deletion, fermentations were compared using ai <dig> and ai <dig> . the results showed that the xylb deletion likely prevented some xylose loss from metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway. during the 144 h fermentation, compared to that of ai <dig>  ai <dig> produced more xylitol  and less acetate , but used an equivalent amount of xylose , resulting in an increased xylose to xylitol conversion ratio . nevertheless, the xylb deletion resulted in d-xylulose accumulation ; meaning some of the substrate was lost as an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway.fig.  <dig> xylitol fermentation from glucose  and xylose  mixture. a cell growth; b glucose utilization; c xylose utilization; d xylitol production; e acetate by-product accumulation. symbols for strain: filled square, ai05; open square, ai09; open triangle, ai12; open cycle, ai21



anaerobic expression of the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon by promoter replacement
although the xylb gene deletion improved the xylose to xylitol conversion ratio, the observed molar yield of xylitol per glucose metabolized  of ai <dig> in resting cell fermentation was expected to be similar to the one obtained by the parent ai <dig>  because a maximal  <dig> nadh output per glucose catabolized remained the same in both strains. although this yrpg was comparable to the one reported in literature  <cit> , the majority of the potential reducing power of glucose catabolized remained in the excess acetate due to the fact that the anaerobically growing e. coli cells have an incomplete tca cycle for acetyl-coa oxidation . furthermore, the reductive branch had been blocked by the frdbc deletion in our engineered strain ai <dig>  <cit> , making the oxidative branch irrelevant. the acetyl-coa derived from pyruvate oxidation by the anaerobically transcribed pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was unable to be oxidized through tca cycle, resulting in accumulation of acetate as a by-product. our hypothesis is that a theoretical yrpg of  <dig> could be achieved if all of the reducing power had been extracted from glucose catabolism with the anaerobically active pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and a complete tca cycle  .

although the enzymatic activity has not been measured, the icda  and acnab  should be active  in our engineered strain because the parent strain can grow anaerobically in glucose minimal medium without supplement of glutamate . the incomplete tca cycle is probably due to the anaerobic repression of the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon, which encodes for succinate dehydrogenase , the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex , and succinyl-coa synthetase , three key enzymes needed for a complete tca cycle  <cit>  . although there is no guarantee, but very likely, a functional tca cycle can be established, at least in some degree, by anaerobic expression of sdhcdab-sucabcd operon. therefore, a synthetic respiration pathway can be established for reduction of xylose to xylitol, using  nadh from glucose catabolism via glycolysis, anaerobic expressed pyruvate dehydrogenase and functional tca cycle.

to enable an anaerobically functional tca cycle, chromosomal replacement of the native aerobic promoter of the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon with the highly anaerobically functional promoter of the pflb gene  was performed. in the past, the pflbp <dig> promoter has been proven quite efficient in the expressing pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  under anaerobic conditions  <cit> . in addition, an upstream fnr  box and the pflb ribosomal binding site were included in the promoter replacement for maximal expression of the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon. the resulting strain was designated ai <dig> -sdhcdab-sucabcd) .

the functionality of the transcriptional fusion of pflbp <dig> and the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon engineered in e. coli ai <dig> was initially analyzed by quantitative pcr of the sdhc and suca transcripts. the results showed that there was a  <dig>   <dig>  and 10-fold increase in sdhc transcripts in ai <dig> cells grown on glucose, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate, respectively, compared to that of the control. qpcr analysis of the suca transcripts revealed a similar trend of higher expression in ai <dig> than that of the control. these results confirmed that the pflbp <dig> promoter allowed for effective expression of the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon under oxygen-limiting conditions.

the transcriptional fusion of pflbp <dig> and sdhcdab-sucabcd was further evaluated by analysis of the activities of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase. the observed succinate dehydrogenase activity of ai <dig> displayed an  <dig> and 73 % increase for cells grown in glucose and succinate, respectively, compared to that of the control strain. similarly, the observed α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity displayed a 68 % increase in ai <dig> over that of the control strain.

anaerobically functional tca cycle increased nadh output and xylitol yield per glucose catabolized
the enhanced enzymatic activities of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase would allow acetyl-coa oxidation via tca cycle  and resulting in an improved nadh output from glucose catabolism. to evaluate the improvement in the nadh output of the engineered strain, ai <dig> was compared to its parent strain for cellular concentrations of nadh, nad, and nadh/nad ratios by growing cells in sealed screw-cap erlenmeyer flasks containing 2 % glucose mineral salts medium. subsequent assays showed a clear increase in the cellular nadh concentration of ai <dig>  compared to that of the parent strain . the calculated nadh/nad ratios showed that there was about a 45 % increase in reducing power output in ai <dig>  compared to that of the control . these results are comparable to nadh/nad ratios observed in arca deletion mutants grown under similar conditions  <cit> . these results demonstrated that it is possible to increase the potential redox output of the tca cycle  without having to remove the arca  and fnr global regulators. one issue still remains from the performed reducing power assays, the loss of reducing power from nadh oxidation by nadh dehydrogenases. however, there is still a clear indication that the anaerobic expression of the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon increases the reducing power output.

theoretically, the increased nadh output of glucose catabolism in ai <dig> would be used to reduce additional xylose to xylitol, resulting in an increase in xylitol yield per glucose catabolized. to test this hypothesis, xylitol fermentations were carried out by the engineered strains carrying plasmid pai <dig> using mineral salts medium supplemented with glucose/xylose mixtures  . during the 144 h fermentation, strain ai <dig> used a similar amount of glucose  , more xylose  , and produced a significantly higher concentration of xylitol   compared to that of the control strain, ai <dig>  based on these results, the calculated xylitol yield per glucose catabolized in ai <dig>  is significantly higher than that of ai <dig> , which suggests that at least some of the acetyl-coa was oxidized through tca cycle, generating extra nadh for xylose reduction. nevertheless, the xylose to xylitol conversion ratio of ai <dig>  is similar to the one achieved by ai <dig> , suggesting that significant amounts of xylose was still lost as d-xylulose.

deletion of the xyla gene resulted in a 1: <dig> xylose to xylitol conversion
to improve the xylose to xylitol conversion ratio and minimize xylose loss as d-xylulose, the xyla gene, the first gene in the pentose phosphate pathway for xylose metabolism , was deleted from ai <dig>  resulting in strain ai <dig>  this deletion channeled all xylose into xylitol production as confirmed by ai <dig> fermentations . approximately 77 mm xylose was metabolized  to produce ~82 mm xylitol , suggesting an approximate 1: <dig> xylose to xylitol conversion in ai <dig>  during this period, ~32 mm glucose was used as a source of reducing power. the calculated yrpg of ai <dig> was  <dig> , although the actual yrpg would be over  <dig> if the glucose used for cell growth  was considered . it is interesting to note that a significantly decreased acetate accumulation by ai <dig> strain than that of ai <dig>  this might be attributed to the re-use of acetate by conversion to acetyl-coa ) in ai <dig>  when glucose was completely metabolized after 96 h fermentation . in ai <dig> fermentation, however, acetate was not re-used because there was some glucose available until 144 h, resulting in accumulation of acetate.table  <dig> summary of e. coli ai <dig>  and ai <dig>  fermentations a

carbon recovery  c

a the data refers to that obtained at the end of fermentation . a  <dig>  % glucose and  <dig>  % xylose sugar mixture was used for batch fermentation; while a  <dig>  % glucose and 2 % xylose sugar mixture was used for resting cell fermentation


b the yrpg was calculated from the total xylitol produced  divided by the total glucose used . for batch fermentation, the glucose used for cell growth was deducted from the total glucose consumed, yielding a yrpg of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for ai <dig> and ai <dig>  respectively


c the carbon recovery was calculated based on two assumptions: 1) the amount of co <dig> produced  equals the amount of acetate produced ; 2) the carbon weight accounts for 50 % of the cell mass



the yrpg of  <dig>  achieved by ai <dig> was greater than that of other parent strains, illustrating that greater reducing power output does increase fermentative production of a reduced product. though this yrpg value is approximately one-third of the theoretical potential of our engineered strain, this is the highest reported molar yield of xylitol produced per glucose consumed in batch cultures grown either aerobically or anaerobically  <cit> .

resting cell fermentation
to evaluate the maximal nadh output potential of glucose catabolism by the engineered strain ai <dig>  resting cell fermentations were performed using an equivalent cell density of od <dig>  <dig>   in a screw-cap flask filled completely with modified mineral salts medium containing a glucose  and xylose  mixture, and chloramphenicol. this culture environment allowed cells to be metabolically active with the already available enzymes, but incapable of growth due to the lack of a nitrogen source and inhibition from chloramphenicol . during resting cell fermentation, the observed yrpg values exceeded those of batch fermentations . ai <dig> achieved an yrpg of  <dig>  which is over 60 % higher than that achieved by the parent strain ai <dig> . in addition, there was no loss of xylose to by-products such as xylulose or acetate, confirming the 1: <dig> xylose to xylitol conversion. furthermore, the apparent yrpg of  <dig> achieved by ai <dig> is significantly greater than the maximum previously reported by cirino et al.  .

it is worthy to note that when cell growth is restricted, the theoretical maximum value of yrpg is  <dig>  correlating with the maximum yield of  <dig> nadh from the complete oxidation of a molecule of glucose . our most efficient strain, ai <dig>  achieved 60 % of the theoretical maximum yrpg. since there was little acetate production  during resting cell fermentation, acetate accumulation was not attributed to the “missing nadh” per glucose catabolized . two possible outcomes of the “missing nadh” would be: 1) the oxidation of nadh through the electron transport system, although this pathway shouldn’t be active under anaerobic conditions; 2) the conversion of nadh to nadph by the transhydrogenase or nadh kinase, although nadph was reported to be the preferred reducing power used by the aldose reductase of c. boidinii   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the e. coli strain ai <dig>  previously engineered for reduction of xylose to xylitol  using the reducing power output from anaerobic glucose catabolism, was further improved by: 1) deleting the xylab operon to block xylose loss through the pentose phosphate pathway, achieving a 100 % reduction of xylose to xylitol; 2) anaerobic expressing of the sdhcdab-sucabcd operon to allow acetyl-coa oxidation via tca cycle, generating a theoretical  <dig> nadh output from the catabolism of one glucose for the reduction of  <dig> xylose to  <dig> xylitol. the resulting e. coli strain ai <dig>  achieved an actual 100 % reduction of xylose to xylitol, and 60 % of the theoretical maximum xylitol yield per glucose catabolized . nevertheless, an yrpg of  <dig> is the highest known value reported in literature. further improvements in the xylitol yield could be achieved by enhancing the conversion of nadh to nadph, the preferred reducing power of the aldose reductase of c. boidinii   <cit> . in addition, this strategy can be used to engineer microbial strains for the homofermentative production of other reduced products from pentose sugars using glucose as a source of reducing power.
