BACKGROUND
retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that replicate via an rna intermediate. their replication cycles and genome organisation are similar in many respects to those of retroviruses, and retrotransposons form a cytoplasmic virus-like particle during replication. both groups of retroelements have a genome comprising gag and pol coding sequences. gag proteins make up the capsid of the viral particle while pol encodes a polyprotein usually made up of integrase, protease and reverse transcriptase activities. these are cleaved from the polyprotein by the action of the viral protease  <cit> .

all retroelements face the common regulatory challenge of expressing gag proteins in a 20: <dig> molar ratio to the enzymic pol proteins from a single rna genome  <cit> . departure from this stoichiometry causes defects in retroviral and retrotransposon replication  <cit> . various post-transcriptional regulatory strategies are employed to maintain gag/pol stoichiometry. the drosophila copia retroelement uses regulated splicing to produce gag proteins from one rna, and at a lower level, gag-pol protein from a separate rna  <cit> . many other retroelements control gag/pol ratios at the level of translation. in the retrovirus hiv, the pol reading frame is - <dig> with respect to the  <dig> gag frame, and a ribosomal frameshift realigns the translational reading frame to that of the downstream pol cistron  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae ty <dig> and ty <dig> retroelements use a + <dig> frameshift site to regulate the gag/pol stoichiometry  <cit> .

another group of retroelements has either the gag/pol or pol/env reading frames separated by an in-frame stop codon. this includes tca <dig> from candida albicans, sire <dig> from soybean, and the well-characterised retrovirus moloney murine leukaemia virus   <cit> . in mulv, a purine rich spacer and then an rna pseudoknot sequence follow the gag uag stop codon. both these elements are required to direct a programmed translational readthrough of the stop codon with a frequency of 5%  <cit> . the stop codon is mis-decoded by an ordinary cellular trna  <cit> . the inhibitory binding of the mulv pol-encoded reverse transcriptase to the translation release factor erf <dig> further enhances the readthrough frequency  <cit> .

retroelements are not alone in employing programmed stop codon readthrough to regulate gene expression, with sindbis virus, tobacco mosaic virus, tobacco rattle virus, and other plant viruses employing a similar strategy  <cit> . in all cases, the immediate nucleotide context of the stop codon, in particular the six 3' nucleotides, is a key  component of the readthrough signal  <cit> . for example, readthrough in tobacco mosaic virus and other plant virus is directed solely by the consensus sequence car-yya immediately 3' of the stop codon  <cit> , and in sindbis virus, by a cytidine residue immediately 3' of the stop codon  <cit> . in contrast to these viral examples of readthrough, how stop codons in other retroelements are bypassed is unknown. for this reason, we elected to study tca <dig>  an active retrotransposon widespread in c. albicans strains in which gag and pol orfs are separated by an in-frame uga stop codon  <cit> . immediately downstream of the stop codon is an 8-nucleotide purine-rich nucleotide spacer, followed by a sequence capable of forming a bulged stem pseudoknot  <cit> . structurally, this arrangement is very reminiscent of the mulv stop codon context.

in this study we therefore examined whether tca <dig> pol expression results from readthrough of the gag stop codon, enhanced by the rna pseudoknot structure downstream. using the closely-related model yeast s. cerevisiae as a test-bed system, multiple lines of evidence show that local sequences flanking the tca <dig> gag stop codon are insufficient to direct its translational readthrough. however, tca <dig> promoter analysis in c. albicans revealed that the expression of pol proteins matched the induction conditions of the retroelement long terminal repeat  promoter. pol proteins must therefore be expressed from a gag-pol rna, and this indicates that contrary to expectation, in c. albicans, pol protein expression is mediated by a non-canonical stop codon bypass mechanism.

RESULTS
the tca <dig> retrotransposon is widespread in candida albicans and polymorphic in nature
the sequence of the tca <dig> retrotransposons from c. albicans strains hog <dig>  <cit>  and sc <dig>  <cit>  revealed that the gag tga stop codon is followed by sequence capable of forming an mrna pseudoknot structure . in mulv, a similar pseudoknot directs gag stop codon readthrough  <cit> . to assess the importance or otherwise of the tca <dig> pseudoknot, the degree of sequence conservation within  <dig> nucleotides either side of the gag stop codon was assessed. gag-pol junction regions of tca <dig> retroelements from a diverse array of eight clinical c. albicans isolates from different parts of the world were sequenced and compared.

this analysis revealed that the tca <dig> sequences were present in all eight strains tested, and that pseudoknot sequence downstream of the gag tga codon was completely conserved at the nucleotide level within the strains surveyed . however, five codons before the stop codon, a gaa aaa repeat motif was discovered , with a polymorphic copy number , dependent upon strain. this polymorphism 5' of the stop codon might be capable of modulating gag uga recognition, because some nascent polypeptide sequences can influence translation termination efficiency  <cit> . overall, the complete conservation of the pseudoknot sequence at the nucleotide level suggests this potential rna structure may be functional.

the tca <dig> gag-pol junction region directs significant expression of a downstream cistron
the strong organisational similarity of tca <dig> and the mulv stop codon contexts suggests that cis mrna sequences surrounding the tca <dig> gag stop codon direct translational readthrough to achieve pol expression  <cit> . translational recoding cis-signals that direct frameshifting or stop codon readthrough frequently function in translation systems of divergent species. for example, the tobacco mosaic virus stop codon readthrough context also functions in yeast and human as well as the natural plant host  <cit> . the hiv - <dig> frameshift signal functions in yeast and e. coli as well as the natural human host  <cit> . accordingly, the tca <dig> stop codon region was tested for its ability to direct translational stop codon readthrough in the related yeast s. cerevisiae, in which a well-established dual reporter lacz-luc vector system has been used to characterise translational recoding signals from a number of species  <cit> . by cloning the tca <dig> gag-pol junction region in-frame between the translationally fused lacz and luc genes, gag stop codon readthrough frequency could be assessed by measuring luciferase expression relative to that of lacz. on the basis of reported retroelement gag-pol stoichiometry, luciferase expression levels in the gag tga stop codon construct would be expected to be 5% of those in a gag tgt sense codon control.

in fact, the tca <dig> gag-pol junction region did allow expression of the downstream luc reporter, but to a far greater extent than anticipated. luciferase expression levels measured using the dual reporter vector containing cloned wild-type tca <dig> sequences  were 120% of those measured with a control vector in which the tga gag stop codon had been replaced with a tgt sense codon . similar results were obtained for other cloned gag-pol junctions containing three or four ek repeats . in contrast, inserting a control taa stop codon between the two reporter genes generated the expected  <dig> % readthrough, typical of ordinary stop codons with low level 'leakiness' .

to determine if the conserved pseudoknot-containing sequences of the gag-pol junction region were important for this stimulation of downstream reporter expression, a 3' deletion analysis was performed on the gag-pol junction region . the results revealed that 3' deletions of pseudoknot sequence further increased gene expression stimulatory activity , indicating these sequences must exert some form of repressive effect on the ability of this region to stimulate downstream gene expression. when the deletion was extended to remove all secondary structure, leaving only the purine rich  <dig> nt immediately downstream of the stop codon, this activity was totally abolished, leaving only  <dig> % apparent stop codon readthrough .

the gag-pol junction sequence directs de novo pol translation initiation events
the discovery that the gag-pol junction region can direct levels of luciferase expression of up to 400% of a control construct is inconsistent with a simple model of stop codon readthrough, where only a maximum level of 100% of control luciferase expression is possible. to investigate this further, any contribution to luciferase expression from stop codon readthrough at the gag uga stop codon was eliminated by the insertion of three in-frame taa stop codons at the 3' end of lacz,  <dig> bases upstream from the native gag stop codon, generating plasmid pgre <dig> . the stop codons were placed in an optimal context for release factor recognition  <cit> , and they isolated the tca <dig> and luciferase sequences from any ribosomes translating the lacz open reading frame. the corresponding control comprised a tga stop codon at the junction of gag and pol, in addition to three caa gln codons inserted at the 3' end of lacz . however, introducing extra stop codons at the end of lacz in pgre <dig> left the level of luciferase expression unchanged, and comparable to the amount of luciferase produced by the control plasmid pgre <dig>  or by the progenitor parent construct lacking the triple stop . in each case, the amount of luciferase production was approximately 250% of that produced by the parent pac <dig> plasmid, in which lacz was translationally fused to luc with no intervening tca <dig> sequence .

the ineffectiveness of the three stop codons in pgre <dig> at eliminating luciferase expression indicates that downstream, de novo translation initiation events must be driving luciferase expression. only two 0-frame aug codons are found in the sequence immediately downstream of lacz , one of which must act as the point of translation initiation for luc orf expression. the first  of these augs lies in the loop of the pseudoknot stem in the pol sequence, with the second lying  <dig> nucleotides into the luc orf . to identify which of these two aug codons was being used to initiate luc orf translation, a - <dig> frameshift mutation was introduced in between the two aug codons, at the junction of tca <dig> segment and the luc orf. the - <dig> frameshift mutation would prevent luciferase expression if translation were initiating at the first 0-frame aug upstream of the frameshift mutation position, but would be silent if the second 0-frame aug codon were being used downstream of the frameshift position. in fact the - <dig> frameshift mutation totally abolished luciferase expression, indicating the aug in the zero frame, at the top of the pseudoknot loop, was acting as a site of de novo translation initiation .

to confirm this, a short orf in the minus- <dig> frame was inserted downstream of the first 0-frame aug codon, at the junction of tca <dig> segment and the luc orf. this comprised three minus- <dig> frame aug codons followed immediately by a - <dig> frame stop codon . if translation were initiating at the first 0-frame aug, the downstream block of three - <dig> frame augs in pgre <dig> would not prevent luciferase expression; this was in fact the case . it seemed likely that this novel translation initiation event at the apex of the pseudoknot loop was occurring either via an efficient internal ribosome entry segment , allowing ribosomes to bind internally to a gag-pol mrna to translate pol, or alternatively because the tca <dig> gag-pol junction region contains a cryptic promoter element driving expression of a pol-only mrna.

gag-pol junction sequence contains a novel promoter activity
to test whether downstream cistron expression was being driven by a separate promoter in the tca <dig> junction region, the sv <dig> promoter that directs lacz-luc fusion expression, and most of the lacz orf, was removed from dual reporter constructs containing  the wild-type tca <dig> sequence, thus generating pfb <dig>   the mutated tca <dig> in which the gag stop codon was changed to tgt, generating pfb <dig>  and  the parental pac <dig> control constructs , generating pfb <dig>  any luciferase expression detected in cells transformed with these plasmids must be driven by the putative promoter activity in the tca <dig> region. the results show clearly that the control vector pfb <dig>  directed only trace luciferase expression, ruling out the possibility that the engineered vector itself contained any significant promoter activity 5' of the luc gene . however, both vectors containing tca <dig> junction sequence upstream of the luc gene were capable of driving levels of luciferase expression approximately 5000-fold greater than the control vector pfb <dig> , indicating that the tca <dig> sequences contain a promoter element functional in s. cerevisiae.

the identification of the novel junction promoter activity allowed results of the 3' gag-pol truncation series to be more fully explained . here, deletion of the stem loop sequences virtually eliminated the ability of the promoter to direct luciferase expression . however, deleting the stem loop also deletes the aug codon likely to be used for translation initiation on the junction promoter mrna , requiring initiating ribosomes to scan downstream for the next aug codon, which in fact lies in the + <dig> frame with respect to the luc . ribosomes thus initiate translation in the wrong frame, and luciferase expression is eliminated.

gag-pol junction flanking regions do not direct stop codon readthrough in s. cerevisiae
the preceding experiments strongly indicate the existence of a promoter element in the tca <dig> gag-pol junction region. however, they do not exclude the possibility that luciferase expression  is being driven by composite effects, for example by a combination of stop codon readthrough and by the identified promoter. to examine these possibilities, the weak sv <dig> promoter that directs expression of the dicistronic lacz-luc constructs in pac <dig>  <cit>  was replaced by the strong, constitutive yeast tef <dig> promoter in a new series of plasmids . this replacement was intended to drive expression of high levels of lacz-luc mrna and effectively mask the relatively weak, tca2-derived, internal promoter activity directing low level expression of luc-only mrna.

as expected, the new tef <dig> promoter vectors produced 1000-fold greater specific-β-galactosidase activity compared to the original pac98-based vectors . when a control stop codon was cloned in between lacz and luc genes, luc expression dropped to  <dig>  % of control, again as expected . when the tca <dig> gag-pol junction sequence containing the gag tga stop codon was tested using the tef <dig> promoter vector , luc expression was also about  <dig> % of a control gag-tgt construct . this result clearly shows that the gag-pol tca <dig> junction sequence does not stimulate luciferase expression in s. cerevisiae via stop codon readthrough, or an ires activity, since tca2-driven luciferase expression was identical to that measured in the control stop codon construct puaa-tef. identical background levels of stop codon readthrough were also measured using additional gag-uga and counterpart sense tgt constructs in which the pseudoknot sequence had been trimmed slightly  an independent verification of this important result . the results therefore clearly show that there is no evidence for this  <dig> nt region of tca <dig> being capable of driving stop codon readthrough or ires initiation in s. cerevisiae.

the penultimate codon in the gag orf is a ctg leucine codon. however, because c. albicans translates cug as serine  <cit> , it was important to ensure that expression in s. cerevisiae mimicked authentic candida translation, since it is known that the identity of the amino acid encoded by the penultimate codon can affect stop codon recognition  <cit> . using site-directed mutagenesis, the tca <dig> gag-pol junction ctg  codon was therefore altered to tgc  so that the s. cerevisiae immediate nascent peptide sequence would be identical to that in c. albicans. levels of stop codon bypass of the gag tga codon in these ctg  – tgc  mutants were re-assayed using the pac98-tef vector system. however, levels of stop codon readthrough remained at background  <dig> % levels , indicating that translation of the ctg gag codon as serine is not a required component of a stop codon readthrough or ires-type activity.

the results as a whole indicate that a novel, but minor promoter activity in this region was the only element capable of directing expression of a gene downstream of the gag tga stop codon in s. cerevisiae, and that additional translational control mechanisms were not operating to drive luciferase expression in tca <dig> gag-pol constructs. the results also indicate that in contrast to most viral or transposon stop codon readthrough signals, and contrary to expectation  <cit>  the immediate gag uga-flanking sequences in tca <dig>  are not active in directing readthrough.

the gag-pol junction promoter is functional in c. albicans
it was important to determine if the novel promoter activity identified by the experiments in s. cerevisiae was also functional in c. albicans, and secondly, to determine the efficiency of the gag-pol junction promoter relative to that of the long terminal repeat  promoter that drives transcription of the major gag-pol rna. a transcriptional activity ratio of 1: <dig> in favour of the ltr promoter might indicate that in this retroelement, pol is translated from a pol-only mrna template produced at 5% of the abundance of a gag-pol rna.

to test the junction promoter activity in candida albicans, the tca <dig> gag-pol junction sequence was cloned upstream of a promoterless lacz reporter in a c. albicans integrative plasmid . once integrated into the candida genome, the ability of the tca <dig> sequence to act as a promoter and drive lacz activity could be assayed. the pseudoknot aug codon, identified as the translation initiation point for transcripts driven by the junction promoter , was placed in frame with the lacz sequence. two vectors were constructed in this way, one carrying the wild-type tca <dig> insert , and one with the tca <dig> sequence with stop codon mutated to sense . these plasmids were integrated into the c. albicans genome and the β-galactosidase specific activity was measured. for comparison, the long terminal repeat  promoter was also cloned into pcrlacz, in such a way that the lacz aug was placed in an equivalent position to that normally occupied by the gag aug, creating pcrlp-ltr.

c. albicans integrants for each of the constructs were grown in liquid culture, either at a constant temperature of 30°c, or at a temperature of 23°c, followed by a 2-hour heat-shock at 37°c. the latter condition replicates that under which tca <dig> is reported to retrotranspose actively  <cit> . the results show that at a constant 30°c, the junction promoter has an activity  <dig> % of that of the ltr promoter . this activity ratio would produce a ratio of gag to gag-pol proteins of 20: <dig>  consistent with molar ratios required in other retroelements to generate active retroviruses, although there is no evidence that tca <dig> is active at 30°c. under heat shock conditions, transcription from the ltr promoter increased five-fold, consistent with the reported increase in retrotransposition under these conditions . however, the junction promoter activity was unaffected by heat-shock, meaning that under conditions where the retrotransposon is reportedly most active, the activity of the junction promoter was only  <dig> % of that of the ltr promoter. this departs significantly from gag-pol ratios reportedly required to produce active retrotransposition. these results therefore challenged the hypothesis that retrotransposition is dependent upon the newly identified junction promoter driving expression of a pol-only mrna template from which tca <dig> pol proteins are translated, and instead favour the hypothesis that the ltr promoter somehow directs pol synthesis.

the induction properties of the tca <dig> pol protein match those of the ltr promoter
the discovery that unlike the ltr promoter, the gag-pol junction promoter is not heat shock-inducible, makes it unlikely that the junction promoter directs significant pol expression during active retrotransposition. accordingly, evidence was sought that in c. albicans, pol protein expression is driven from the ltr promoter. were this to be the case, it would be expected that pol protein expression would be significantly induced following a 23°c–37°c heat shock.

to test this hypothesis, homologous recombination was used to epitope tag a c. albicans genomic copy of tca <dig> at the 3' end of pol, immediately before the pol stop codon, with protein a coding sequence. replicate integrants of this type, together with the parental wild-type strain, were grown in liquid culture either at a constant temperature of 30°c, or at a temperature of 23°c, followed by a  <dig> hour heat-shock at 37°c. lysates were prepared from these cultures, proteins resolved using sds-page, western blotted, and blots probed with anti-protein a antibody. care was taken to ensure equivalent lane loadings , that the antibody was specific for protein a, and that it did not significantly cross-react with any wild-type c. albicans proteins .

the resulting autoradiographs show that in the protein a-integrant, but not in the parental strain, a protein of  <dig> kda that was almost undetectable in the 30°c lysates was induced strongly following heat shock . this result was reproduced in at least four independently isolated integrants . subtraction of the mass of the protein a tag  from that of the heat-shock induced protein , leaves a native untagged mass of  <dig> kda. this is consistent with an approximate size range for the pol reverse transcriptase  protein, the most 3' of the tca <dig> pol enzyme activities. in fact, s. cerevisiae ty <dig> retrotransposon rt was measured at  <dig> kda using a similar tagging protocol  <cit> . it was not possible to immuno-detect any putative gag-pol fusion protein, since it is expected this would be cleaved by the integral retrotransposon protease activity within pol. crucially, the detection of a tca <dig> putative proteina-tagged reverse transcriptase that was strongly heat-shock induced directly suggests that pol proteins are not expressed from a pol rna-only product of the junction promoter, but in fact are translated from a gag-pol mrna transcribed from the heat-shock inducible ltr promoter. this in turn would indicate that to achieve this translation, in some way the translation terminating effect of the gag stop codon within a gag-pol transcript must be bypassed.

discussion
translational control mechanisms are frequently employed to achieve regulated gag-pol expression in different retroelements. many examples are known of viral or retrotransposon stop codons that are readthrough at a given frequency during translation, allowing controlled expression of downstream coding information  <cit> . in tca <dig>  the gag uga stop codon, sited upstream of a potential rna pseudoknot sequence, was suggested to be an obvious candidate for this type of programmed translational readthrough. the nucleotide environment of the tca <dig> gag stop codon, which includes a downstream potential rna pseudoknot sequence, was very similar to that of the mulv gag stop codon, which is readthrough at a frequency of 5% to allow pol expression  <cit> . however, in this work, experiments in s. cerevisiae testing the hypothesis using dicistronic constructs produced some surprising results. the measured 'readthrough' frequencies in excess of 100% were a clear indication that the tca <dig> sequence must direct at least a proportion of luciferase expression via mechanisms other than stop codon readthrough , and in fact a minor promoter activity was found within the junction sequence that explained this . although attempts to detect this mrna using northern blotting were ultimately unsuccessful because of the very low junction promoter activity , the gag-pol junction sequence was able to drive expression of a promoter-less reporter in c. albicans, indicating it did have limited promoter function in both s. cerevisiae and its natural host, albeit minor . analysis of this region identified neither known transcription factor binding sites, nor a tata box element  reinforcing the view that this is a weak promoter. however, it cannot be excluded that this junction promoter plays some role in tca <dig> retrotransposition, although clearly this would require a mechanism to recruit free pol proteins into the tca <dig> capsid. moreover, since this novel promoter was not induced by heat-shock, conditions that are known to greatly increase the ltr promoter activity, pol protein expression and the frequency of tca <dig> retrotransposition   <cit> , it is apparent that the ltr promoter, rather than the junction promoter, plays the dominant role in directing pol expression.

the identification of a novel gag-pol junction promoter activity did not exclude the formal possibility that the measured 'readthrough' levels of 120% in s. cerevisiae were perhaps a composite of 5% stop codon readthrough and 115% of junction promoter activity. for this reason, promoter replacement strategies were employed in s. cerevisiae, switching the very weak sv <dig> promoter that normally drives the lacz-luc constructs with the powerful constitutive tef <dig> promoter from the yeast translation elongation factor ef1-α. this had the effect of masking the low numbers of transcripts produced by the junction promoter. using this approach, readthrough levels of  <dig> % of control were measured, no different from those of an ordinary, control, stop codon . based on this evidence, we concluded that this 300-nucleotide region of tca <dig> was incapable of directing translational stop codon readthrough, at least in s. cerevisiae. this result, although negative, is important. viral cis rna sequences that flank stop codons and trigger translational readthrough have two key properties;  they are limited in their extent to the immediate stop codon environment, often comprising just  <dig> nucleotides either side of the termination codon and  they are frequently 'portable', that is to say they are functional in non-host systems. the tmv stop codon readthrough signal functions in s. cerevisiae and human, for instance  <cit> , and in xenopus  <cit> . the fact that tca <dig> uga ribosomal readthrough was undetectable in s. cerevisiae indicates strongly that the tca <dig> sequence comprising  <dig> nt centred on the gag stop codon does not represent a  stop codon readthrough signal. tca <dig> pol expression does not therefore conform to the tmv or mulv readthrough paradigms.

despite the lack of detectable gag uga readthrough activity in s. cerevisiae, epitope tagging of the reverse transcriptase sequence of genomic tca <dig> in c. albicans showed unequivocally that the expression pattern of the tagged pol protein was identical to the heat-shock transcriptional responses of the ltr promoter, but not those of the gag-pol junction promoter . this clearly indicates that in c. albicans, pol proteins are translated from the gag-pol rna required for genome replication and transposition. this in turn infers that the in-frame uga stop codon must be bypassed in some way in c. albicans. what mechanisms could explain such bypass? we consider two explanations possible. the first is that the uga stop codon is inefficiently spliced from the gag-pol rna to produce, at low level, an mrna encoding a gag-pol translational fusion. regulated splicing of a gag-pol rna to allow gag-independent production of pol proteins occurs in foamy viruses, a type of retrovirus  <cit> . however, since s. cerevisiae and c. albicans splice signals are highly similar  <cit> , it would be expected that 'stop codon splicing' would have been replicated in the s. cerevisiae dual reporter experiments, and we therefore consider this explanation unlikely. the second explanation is that despite the finding in s. cerevisiae that tca <dig> does not conform to the tmv readthrough signal model, tca <dig> does achieve pol expression via translational readthrough, but that this is dependent on additional cis sequences remote from the large  <dig> nt window tested. this is the case in barley yellow dwarf virus, where sequences up to  <dig> nt. 3' of the stop codon are required for readthrough  <cit> . this possibility was not addressed by our survey of  <dig> nt. surrounding the gag stop codon in s. cerevisiae because incorporating large sequence windows into the dicistronic reporter construct may have interfered with protein stability , but future investigations could address this possibility.

it is finally possible that a candida-specific trans factor might be required to direct stop codon readthrough, explaining why readthrough was not detectable in the s. cerevisiae test-bed system. however, the similarity of the c. albicans translational apparatus to that of s. cerevisiae favours the expectation that tca <dig> stop codon readthrough should be functional in baker's yeast. in plant translation systems, programmed stop codon readthrough of viral uga stop codons is driven in different cases by one of either cysteinyl trnagca, tryptophanylt rnacca, or arginyl trnaucg , and this could in theory differentiate the decoding properties of the two trnas. however, the s. cerevisiae tryptophanyl trna is a known functional uga suppressor  <cit> , and therefore s. cerevisiae trnatrp should be capable of mediating tca <dig> gag uga readthrough. however most important in this discussion is the repeated observation that mrna cis factors, rather than trans factors, are centrally important in stop codon readthrough signals, and where tested, these have proved functional in non-host translation systems e.g.  <cit> . the expectation is therefore that if stop codon readthrough were being driven by the  <dig> nucleotide window of gag-pol junction cis sequences in c. albicans, readthrough at some level would have been detected in the s. cerevisiae dicistronic constructs.

CONCLUSIONS
our work has demonstrated firstly that a novel tca <dig> promoter activity lies at the junction of gag and pol. although the evidence does not indicate a central role for this promoter in bulk gag-pol synthesis, in c. albicans this novel promoter may contribute subtly to tca <dig> regulation under non-induced conditions. secondly, this study has unequivocally demonstrated that counter to predictions, local cis mrna sequences surrounding the tca <dig> gag stop codon, including a putative pseudoknot, are insufficient to direct stop codon readthrough in baker's yeast, although gag stop codon readthrough was not assayed in c. albicans. no evidence to support the existence of the pseudoknot was obtained from this study. the tca <dig> gag stop codon context does not therefore confer termination 'leakiness' as those of mulv gag or the tmv replicase do. it is therefore possible that sequences directing readthrough are multiple, remote and scattered over the tca <dig> element, rather than simply stop codon-flanking. finally, evidence is presented that in c. albicans, pol proteins are heat-shock induced, as is the activity of the ltr promoter, indicating that in this organism, pol proteins are translated from a gag-pol rna using a novel mechanism for stop codon bypass. the study overall prompts a reexamination of the default explanation that immediate stop codon contexts direct translation termination readthrough in viral and transposon systems.
