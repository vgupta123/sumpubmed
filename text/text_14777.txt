BACKGROUND
in the course of neural tissue genesis, multipotent neuroepithelial stem/progenitor cells give rise to a number of transient and persisting cell types. despite the apparent histological homogeneity, the early neuroepithelium is composed of clusters of cell populations with different expression of "pre-neural" and "positional" genes  <cit> . in the closing neural tube, regionalization and segmentation take place well before the formation of neurons  <cit> . the regional heterogeneity is then translated into neuronal sub-type heterogeneity during neural tissue formation  <cit> .

the place of origin highly determines the morphology and the neurotransmitter phenotype of future neurons  <cit> . in neuronal progenitors and early precursors, regional determination is thought to decide on the expression of possible homologues of basic helix-loop-helix  proneural transcription factors  <cit> . in the forebrain, mash <dig> bhlh proneural factor is expressed in ventral areas, together with the dlx <dig> positional factor, which is responsible for the activation of the gad <dig>  a key enzyme of gaba synthesis. the gene cascade is required for the differentiation and migration of ventral forebrain derived gabaergic interneurons of the cortex  <cit> . in establishment of the cortical glutamatergic neuronal phenotype, ngn <dig>  another bhlh proneural factor plays an essential role  <cit> . emx <dig> transcription factor, which is expressed in an overlapping domain with ngn <dig> helps to maintain the stem/progenitor pool in the ventricular zone of the dorsal anterior forebrain, therefore it appears to be an important regulator of the size of the cerebral cortex  <cit> . despite of rapidly accumulating data, the mechanisms underlying the timing and spatial restrictions of the activation of region-specific and proneural genes are not fully understood. consequently, the regulation of neuronal sub-type determination is not clear.

because of the complexity of the developing central nervous tissue, simplified in vitro models, including cultures of embryonic  <cit>  or adult  <cit>  neuroectodermal progenitors and neurosphere preparations  <cit>  have been used to investigate neural cell fate decision. the in vitro results indicated some flexible regional commitment of neural stem cells  <cit>  and a decisive role of the extracellular environment in regional specification  <cit> . primary cultures and neurosphere preparations, however, contain multiple types of cells with heterogeneity in both origin and differentiation phase  <cit> . the heterogeneity hinders the identification of the routes and consequently, the regulatory mechanisms leading to regional and phenotypic determination. homogeneous starting material for such studies is provided by pheno- and genotypically homogeneous, cloned stem cell populations.

in the presented work, the expression of proneural bhlh transcription factors were investigated in conjunction with the activation of various region-specific genes in the course of in vitro neuron formation by three different, mouse stem-like cell clones including ne-4c embryonic neuroectodermal  <cit> , r <dig> embryonic stem   <cit>  and the p <dig> embryonic carcinoma   <cit>  cell clones.

the ne-4c clone  <cit>  was derived from anterior brain vesicles of p53-deficient early  mouse embryos, and is composed by a nestin expressing population of proliferating neuroectodermal stem cells. if induced by all-trans retinoic acid  or by the presence of perinatal astrocytes  <cit> , ne-4c cells give rise to neurons and later to astrocytes on a highly reproducible schedule  <cit> . as a further indication of neural stem cell nature, ne-4c cells integrate into the embryonic brain tissue and provide neurons for the early developing host brain  <cit> . implantation-experiments  <cit>  demonstrated that ne-4c cells, in vivo, can generate myelin oligodendrocyte-specific protein , o1–o <dig> and rip immunoreactive oligodendrocytes, as well.

the lack of p <dig> did not interfere with neuron formation  <cit> . data on the interference of p <dig> with the activation of region-specific genes, or with the determination of the body axes, however, are missing. therefore we conducted experiments on two other clones of embryonic stem-like cells   <cit>  and the p <dig>  <cit>   cells, both known to have no defect in their p <dig> pathway. embryonic stem  and embryonic carcinoma  cell lines represent multipotent populations of early embryonic cells, which can be directed to neural differentiation  <cit> , but can produce non-neural tissue-type cells, as well. in contrast, ne-4c cells were shown  <cit>  to produce only neural tissue-type cells.

non-induced cells of each line expressed "stemness genes" along with the early embryonic anterior-dorsal otx <dig> gene, but did not transcribe any other investigated cns region-specific genes. in the course of in vitro induced differentiation, however, several region-specific and diverse sub-type specific pro-neuronal genes were activated. in the absence of any exogenous inducers, cell-autonomous mechanisms were sufficient to drive the manifestation of distinct neurotransmitter phenotypes.

RESULTS
in vitro neuron formation by stem-like cells
morphological, cell biological and molecular changes were followed during retinoic acid  induced neural differentiation of r <dig>  <cit> , p <dig>   <cit> ; and ne-4c embryonic neuroectodermal  <cit>  stem cells. large number of neurons was formed by all stem-like cell populations  on a reproducible but cell line-dependent schedule. bulk neuron formation was evident in p <dig> cultures by the 3rd day of ra-induction. for mass appearance of neurons, es cells must have been first grown as aggregates and treated with ra for  <dig> days , and then incubated in monolayer cultures for a further  <dig> days.

differentiation of ne-4c cells proceeded through well-characterized stages , each marked by a specific combination of immunocytochemical markers  <cit> , appearance of novel cell physiological features  <cit>  and the formation of specific cell-arrangements  <cit> . rc <dig> immune-positive, radial glia-like cells appeared by the end of stage  <dig> and were located in clusters of morphologically yet homogeneous cells . the first neuronal precursors with βiii-tubulin and nfl immunoreactivity appeared in stage  <dig>  and a large number of developing neurons formed by stage  <dig>  the number of rc <dig> radial-glia like cells decreased when neurogenesis reached its highest level. . in stage  <dig> , networks of mature neurons formed  <cit>  on the top of a substrate-attached monolayer of flat cells containing a number of gfap-positive astrocytes. ssea- <dig> immune-reactive, self-renewing stem cells with neural inducibility  persisted in differentiated  ne-4c cultures , and composed substrate-attached spots among differentiated neurons and gfap-positive astrocytes.

region-specific genes got activated along with neural differentiation
non-differentiated ne-4c stem cells expressed otx <dig>  but no other investigated region-specific factors. otx <dig> a known early neuroectodermal marker gene  <cit>  was active also in non-induced es and ec cells. non-differentiated r <dig> es and p <dig> ec cells, but not ne-4c cells also expressed emx <dig> region-specific and mash <dig> pro-neural genes .

by the time of the mass-production of neurons displaying βiii-tubulin immune-reactivity and expressing the math <dig> neuronal gene , region-specific genes, emx <dig>  dlx <dig>  hox2b, marking non-overlapping regions in the developing nervous system, were activated in all – es, ec and ne-4c – cultures .

ssea- <dig> positive, non-differentiated cells persisting in differentiated ne-4c neural cultures  and comprising  <dig> to 5% of total cells, were separated by facs sorting for ssea- <dig> immunoreactivity . from the selected ssea- <dig> positive cell fraction several one-cell derived colonies were established by cell cloning. these subclones of morphologically non-differentiated , proliferating cells could be induced by ra to give rise to neurons and astrocytes , indicating a preserved developmental capacity of ne-4c mother cells. in their non-induced stage , ssea- <dig> sorted sub-clones did not express the investigated region-specific genes , except otx <dig> . a variety of region-specific genes, however, became activated by the time of appearance of neurons . the data indicated that expression of diverse region-specific genes was induced along with neural differentiation.

particular region-specific genes become activated in different stages of in vitro neural differentiation
the onset of detectable transcription from the investigated region-specific genes seemed to be bound to two different stages of neural development of ne-4c cells . one set of region-specific genes including pax <dig>  gbx <dig> and hoxb <dig> were activated as early as stage  <dig>  when pro-neural gene-activity had already been turned on. )

the expression of another group of region-specific genes  was detected not sooner than stage  <dig>  when math <dig>  a marker for postmitotic maturing neurons  <cit>  was also active .

bearing in mind that ra may also serve as a "posteriorizing and ventralizing" agent  <cit> , we compared the effects of short-and long-term presence of ra. in addition to the standard 48-hour treatment, ne-4c cells were exposed to 10- <dig> m ra for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours and the expression of several region-specific genes was investigated on the 7th day  of induction . each exposure to ra resulted in neuron formation , but the proportion of neurons was smaller after the shortest  induction. long-term exposure to ra  effectively reduced the otx <dig> transcript level , but failed to cause relevant changes in the expression of many positional genes including the anterior-dorsal emx <dig> 

one-cell derived progenies can acquire diverse neurotransmitter phenotypes
the expression of different homologues of proneural genes  and the activation of diverse region-specific genes suggested a possible diversity in the neurotransmitter phenotype adopted by ne-4c neurons. immunocytochemical analyses of differentiated  ne-4c cultures demonstrated gabaergic  and glutamatergic  cells among mature, neun  <cit> , map <dig> or βiii-tubulin immunopositive neurons. gabaergic neurons were identified by the presence of the vesicular gaba transporter . glutamatergic neurons were stained for the vesicular glutamate transporter . in stage  <dig>  these two neuronal subtypes, together, composed the majority  of neun positive cells .

in addition to demonstrating the activity of proneural genes linked to the establishment of the gabaergic and glutamatergic phenotypes , several genes involved in the maintenance of these neurotransmitter phenotypes were transcribed in differentiating ne-4c cultures .

as expected from earlier results  <cit> , many genes related to gaba metabolism were active at early stages of neural differentiation , well before the appearance of morphologically identified neurons. while ebihara and colleagues  <cit>  reported on a low-level vgat expression in non-induced p <dig> cells, the ubiquitous presence of vgat mrna in all non-induced stem-like cells, was a rather unexpected finding. in contrast to a marked presence of vgat mrna in non-induced ne-4c cultures, vgat immunoreactivity was detected only in a proportion of mature neurons at stages  <dig> and  <dig> . by this stage, genes coding for the gaba synthesizing enzymes  were also active .

the vesicular glutamate transporter type  <dig> , was undetectable in non-differentiated stem-like cell cultures, either at mrna or protein level. the activation of vglut <dig> gene was detected only in neuron-rich, math <dig> expressing cultures derived either from es, ec or from neuroectodermal stem cells . accordingly, vglut <dig> immunoreactive neurons were detected only in differentiated neuronal cultures from stage  <dig> onwards . in order to decide whether individual ne-4c derived neurons were exclusively committed to either gabaergic or glutamatergic fates, neurons were double-stained for vgat and vglut <dig> proteins . double immunolabeling revealed a complete segregation of vgat and vglut <dig> staining, indicating the differentiation of at least two distinct subtypes of neurons.

while a few serotonin containing  cells were revealed, ne-4c neurons with tyrosine-hydroxylase immunoreactivity were not found . genes coding for transcription factors involved in the regulation of monoaminergic differentiation . according to gene array analysis , however, the expression from a number of genes related to monoaminergic development  <cit>  did not increase significantly in the course of in vitro induced neuron formation.

100% was determined as the total number of the neun positive neurons

the data demonstrated that after initiation of neural differentiation by ra, intrinsic interactions between one-cell derived neural progenitors were sufficient to establish distinct gaba or glutamatergic neurotransmitter phenotypes, but did not result in the formation of catecholaminergic neurons.

discussion
in non-induced stages, one-cell derived populations of es, ec and neuroectodermal stem cells expressed only early anterior-dorsal region-specific genes, characterizing the developing epiblast/neural plate areas  <cit> . upon neural differentiation, a variety of region-specific genes, those expressed in non-overlapping regions of the developing cns, were activated.

the activation of positional genes seemed to depend on the stage of differentiation. the r <dig> es, p <dig> ec and ne-4c neuroectodermal stem cells, in their non-induced states, represented different stages of stem cell differentiation. for neural commitment, es cells had to be preincubated to form embryoid body like aggregates  <cit>  prior to and during the induction with ra, and mature neurons developed only after a further growth in monolayer cultures. p <dig> cells, on the other hand, produced neurons in a short period  after ra-induction even in comparison to the 5– <dig> days neurogenetic period of ne-4c cells. despite the above differences, ra-induced neural differentiation could be compared among the different cell lines if the activation of ngn <dig> proneural gene was set as a reference point .

in response to ra-induction, es and ec cell populations could give rise to a number of non-neural cells in addition to the differentiation of neurons  <cit> . in such preparations, neural and non-neural cells could interact with each other, mimicking some in vivo interplay between the developing neural and non-neural tissues. in the case of ne-4c neuroectodermal cells, which do not produce any non-neural progenies  <cit>  different region-specific genes were activated by mechanisms inherent to the one-cell derived neuroectodermal population.

a set of region-specific genes, including gbx <dig>  hoxb <dig> and pax <dig> became active along with pro-neural genes, at a stage when the rc <dig> immunoreactive radial glia-like phenotype appeared in induced ne-4c cultures. in case of the hox-family genes, known to respond directly to ra  <cit> , rapid gene activation was expected in response to ra. direct ra-responsiveness of gbx <dig> or pax <dig> genes, however, was not reported. another set of "positional" genes, including emx <dig>  otx <dig>  dlx <dig> nkx <dig> , lmx1b, gata <dig>  expression was detected only after the activation of the neuron-specific math <dig> gene. the delayed activation of these genes could not be the result of any direct effect of ra, as ra was removed days before the onset of the gene activation.

the applied conditions were sufficient to induce and maintain gabaergic and glutamatergic fates in ne-4c neurons, but failed to manifest catecholaminergic or cholinergic  features. the formation of catecholaminergic neurons from es cells  <cit> , requires soluble factors such as shh, fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  ra was reported to promote the production of shh and fgf <dig> in the developing chicken brain  <cit> , but shh production was demonstrated in quails even at complete lack of ra  <cit> . according to gene array analyses , transcription from fgf <dig> and shh did not change in the course of neural differentiation of ne-4c cells. the activation of genes indicating catecholaminergic development including nurr <dig>  <cit>  or tyrosine-hydroxylase , showed either a short transient increase or did not change in the course of neuron formation by ne-4c cells. the absence of catecholaminergic cells suggest an insufficient level of factors necessary for the establishment of monoaminergic phenotypes  <cit> . future experimentation will determine whether the few serotonin containing neurons represented a serotonergic population or only a subpopulation of gabaergic neurons containing  <dig> ht as a neuromodulator  <cit> .

in our experiments, ra was withdrawn from the environment of differentiating cells after initiation of neural differentiation. the intrinsic interactions in differentiating populations of one cell derived ne-4c cells could result in the production of glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons, but failed to manifest all of the major neurotransmitter phenotypes. while several posterior  and ventral  positional genes were activated, this activity was insufficient to manifest catecholaminergic phenotypes in ne-4c derived neurons. it may be due to the restricted developmental potential of the cell line, or may indicate a requirement of extrinsic factors for cholinergic or catecholaminergic commitment.

CONCLUSIONS
the data demonstrated that cell-autonomous mechanisms can direct diverse "regional" specifications in positionally non-determined neuroectodermal cells and manifest different – at least gabaergic and glutamatergic – neurotransmitter phenotypes.
