BACKGROUND
adult pancreatic β cells secrete insulin in response to an increase in extracellular glucose. at birth, this response is not fully developed as neonate β-cells are insensitive to glucose and synthesize and secrete less insulin than adults  <cit> . pancreatic islets are innervated by autonomic fibres. in particular, sympathetic neural cell bodies are located in the superior mesenteric and celiac ganglia and are components of the splanchnic nerve and parasympathetic innervation comes from the vagus nerve  <cit> .

sympathetic innervation plays important roles in the physiology and physiopathology of the endocrine pancreas; nor- and epinephrine inhibit insulin secretion, while stimulate glucagon secretion  <cit> . moreover, sympathetic innervation of pancreatic islets is altered in animal models with insulin resistance and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . however, factors that control sympathetic innervation of pancreatic islets are not clear. the neurotrophin nerve growth factor  is especially interesting because is synthesized by the peripheral targets of ngf-dependent sympathetic neurons and ngf concentrations are proportional to their innervation density  <cit> . for example, ngf participates in the innervation of spleen, peripheral lymph nodes and ovaries  <cit>  and has also trophic effects on their vascularization  <cit> .

adult pancreatic beta cells produce and secrete ngf and express ngf high-  and low-affinity  receptors during lifespan and ngf is important for a normal islet morphogenesis during prenatal life  <cit>  and have trophic effects on β cells survival, maturation and insulin secretion  <cit> . these effects are controlled by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms  <cit> .

sympathetic nerves in the pancreas are closely related to blood vessels  <cit> , and nervous fibres are also in part guided by endothelium-derived signals  <cit> . trophic interactions among nerve cells, blood vessels and islet cells are fundamental to assure an adequate pancreatic ontogeny and a mature assemblage and function.

ngf could be an important regulator molecule on innervation and vascularisation of the islets. the following observations indicate that this could be the case, 1) ngf overexpression in pancreatic β cells causes islet sympathetic hyper-innervation  <cit> . 2) when islet grafts to diabetic rats are pre-treated with ngf, sympathetic innervation is increased after transplantation  <cit> . 3) pancreatic sympathetic innervation is reduced in ngf/bax double knockout  mice  <cit> . finally, ngf in vitro induces development of glucose-induced insulin secretion in neonate rat β cells  <cit>  and promotes neuron-like phenotypic changes in foetal and adult β cells  <cit> . the aim of this study was to investigate the morphophysiological relationships between innervation, vascularization and islet morphogenesis and function during ontogeny of rat pancreas, in particular of islets from foetal , early  and late postnatal  stages of development, compared to adults. we also analyzed biosynthesis and secretion of ngf and insulin by β cells at these stages.

RESULTS
the structure of pancreatic islets during ontogeny
as expected, in mature adult islets glucagon producing β cells form a ring-like structure, surrounding insulin-producing β cells that fill most of the centre . at this stage, we observed that 98% of islets were delimited by a collagen capsule . in contrast, f <dig> islets were not formed yet; we only observed large groups of endocrine cells without a capsule and isolated α and β cells were scattered through the exocrine pancreas . neonatal islets were small, rounded, did not yet presented capsule and were located in close proximity to each other . at p <dig> most of the endocrine cells had a similar distribution to adults; however, only nearly 26% of the islets were encapsulated .

remodelling sympathetic innervation of islets and ngf
to identify the sympathetic fibres we used a tyrosine-hydroxylase  immunofluorescence. a progressive increase in the relative area occupied by th positive innervation in the islets was observed between f <dig> to p <dig> . interestingly, this parameter decreased between p <dig> and adulthood in the periphery of the islets , while increased in the central area .

sympathetic remodelling in this process is probably modulated by ngf produced by islet cells. we analyzed ngf production in situ with an antibody raised against the ngf precursor protein pro-ngf  <cit>  in a and β cells. pro-ngf immunoreactivity was observed in both cell types at all stages studied . however, the fluorescence intensity was higher at f <dig> and p <dig> than at later ontogenetic stages  and when this was studied in isolated islet cells, we confirmed that most of them were β cells  and also labelled positive for trka receptors . at all stages studied mrna for ngf is expressed by islet cells .

ngf is released by foetal and neonatal islet cells
we analyzed ngf secretion by elisa . at all studied stages, islet cells secreted ngf . in accordance to the pro-ngf immunofluorescence observed; ngf secretion was higher at f <dig> and p <dig> than at older ages.

ngf secretion may be constitutive or regulated by other way than glucose stimulated insulin secretion, because clearly from figure 4b, both types of secretions are dissociated. this effect can not be attributed to cultured conditions or reduced cell viability, because p <dig> and adult cultured β cells increased insulin secretion when exposed to high glucose and kcl. under the last experimental condition, adult β cells also increased ngf release.

pro-ngf and trka receptors are expressed for a delimited period in vascular cells
vascular cells may also provide guidance cues to axons in their way to reach their targets  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that blood vessels that enter the islets early in pancreatic ontogeny  labelled positive to pro-ngf, but not at p <dig> and thereafter . blood vessels and sympathetic fibres can respond to ngf, because clear and consistently at all stages both vascular cells and th positive fibres display immunoreactivity for trka receptors .

discussion
we analyzed innervation and function development of pancreatic islets. to our knowledge this is the first analysis of the relationship between innervation, blood vessels and rat pancreatic islets morphology at critical developmental stages. we also examined a possible role of ngf in this process.

glucose homeostasis in foetal stages depends on the mother  <cit> . at birth, mammals abruptly need to achieve glucose control on their own, so β cells start secreting insulin. nearly at p <dig> pups are weaned and they build up an omnivorous diet. these two stages are critical windows for pancreatic development and maturation of glucose induced insulin secretion  <cit> . we propose that a capsule or basal membrane surrounding the islets may be taken as one of the maturity markers, because almost all mature islets in adult animals are surrounded by one. it has been suggested that a membrane surrounding the islets could be an important niche for their complete development and survival  <cit> . we observed that a nearly-mature configuration of the pancreatic islets is progressively established during the first  <dig> days of posnatal life in the rat. however, at this stage nearly 30% of islets presented a continuous capsule surrounding them, indicating that they will continue maturing until adulthood  <cit> .

we observed that pancreatic islets in early development receive an extensive innervation by sympathetic fibres. this innervation is refined later in development. interestingly, when islets are transplanted to the kidney capsule or intraportally, they develop sympathetic innervation after transplantation  <cit> . moreover, when purified β cells are transplanted to the kidney capsule, grafts are progressively innervated mainly by tyrosine hydroxylase-containing nerve fibres. these observations led to suggest that some factors produced by β cells mediate islet neurotrophism  <cit> .

we have previously shown that adult pancreatic β cells produce and secrete ngf  <cit> . in this work we observed that this is the case also along ontogeny, which indicates that ngf may be trophic for sympathetic innervation and survival in islets, as it has been observed for other organs  <cit> . ngf secretion in adult cells could also be important for sympathetic fibres maintenance throughout life.

vascular cells also displayed pro-ngf immunoreactivity, however this is only observed in a critical window around birth. this could also be important for nerve guidance into the islets. there is no perfect marker for blood vessels. we used isolectin ib <dig> and vimentin. vimentin expression alone cannot be considered as specific endothelium marker; but it seems to accompany the process of angiogenesis in islets  <cit> . we also observed that both markers were expressed in blood vessels of developing and mature islets.

ngf produced by β, α and vascular cells might be acting by auto/paracrine mechanisms because all the studied cells within the islets express trka receptors. during development ngf may attract sympathetic fibres as they search for their targets as described for artemin  <cit>  and/or promote sympathetic fibre outgrowth within the islet. the presence of trka receptors in β cells is not new  <cit> . it is likely that ngf acting through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms promotes β cell maturation. in support of this possibility, it has been shown that glucose-induced insulin secretion is increased by ngf after calcium channel translocation to the membrane of the neonate rat β cells  <cit> . the presence of trka receptors in vascular cells, on the other hand, might be important for islet blood vessel development because ngf also promotes angiogenesis  <cit>  and migration of endothelial cell  <cit> .

these results show that sympathetic innervation is subjected to a strong ontogenetic remodelling during pancreatic development. in general terms, there is a trend of innervation to increase from the perinatal period to p <dig>  after this time, the amount of innervation within the islet decreases. early hyper-innervation followed by a late elimination of redundant axons mediated through competitive interactions is commonly seen in peripheral targets  <cit> . however, it is to our knowledge the first description in pancreatic islets.

at earlier stages, sympathetic fibres are located mainly to the periphery of the islets or α cell compartment and as islets mature, an adjustment in the amount of fibres is accompanied by their relocation near the β cell area. changes of preferred territories of axons to innervate during different ontogenetic stages are common. transitory targets are used by growing axons while waiting for their definitive target to reach the maturity needed to receive innervation. this might happen in the pancreas since the innervation enters later to the β cell compartment, when these cells display more mature functional features  <cit> ; in p <dig> through adulthood. adult mice also show more sympathetic fibres located in the periphery of their islets  <cit> .

an interesting issue that deserves consideration relates to the mechanism by which the sympathetic innervation is remodelled. previous observations that show that ngf overexpression in transgenic mice  <cit>  and knocking out ngf and bax  <cit>  led to hyper-innervation and hypo-innervation, respectively, strongly suggest that changes in ngf availability might underlie sympathetic nerve remodelling. accordingly, our results show that insular cells synthesize and release higher amounts of ngf at f <dig> and p <dig> than at p <dig> and after. interestingly, this pattern of ngf secretion closely paralleled the phases of hyper- and hypo-innervation described in this work.

further support for this type of inference is the fact that trka-immunoreactivity was observed in islet sympathetic fibres at all ages. we may speculate that the decrease in ngf release in mature beta cells, might be the result of the negative feedback of norepinephrine, secreted by mature sympathetic fibres  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, these morphological and functional data suggest that ngf plays a pivotal role in pancreatic islet morphogenesis, remodelling and maintenance of sympathetic innervation and development of the vasculature and maturation of a and β cells in the islets, as modelled in fig  <dig> 

there is increasing evidence supporting the causal connection between many adult diseases and an altered ontogeny caused by persistent interactions between the developing organism and its environment early during pre- or postnatal life. a decrease in islet innervation has been shown to be an early target in type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . moreover, both homozygous knockout mice for ngf and trka resulted in dramatic phenotypes showing poor viability, not surviving beyond few weeks  <cit> .

interestingly in humans, an autosomal recessive mutation in trka gene causes a syndrome of congenital insensitivity to pain with anhydrosis . patients with this mutation show an impaired first-phase of glucose induced-insulin secretion  <cit> . finally, a decrease in serum ngf level has been associated with peripheral neuropathy in animal models and humans with diabetes  <cit> .

knowing the roles of ngf in pancreatic islet development, maturation, innervation and function may lead us to new perspectives for understanding and treatment of diabetes mellitus, including better conditions of islets for transplantation.
