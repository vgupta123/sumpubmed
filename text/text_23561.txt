BACKGROUND
growth and development of endochondral bones is controlled through the highly coordinated proliferation and differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes  <cit> . these processes are regulated by a large number of endocrine, paracrine and autocrine hormones and growth factors that, to a large part, act on chondrocyte cell surface receptors. the intracellular signaling pathways mediating these effects are not completely understood; however, over the last  <dig> years many of the key transcriptional regulators of chondrocyte differentiation have been identified. the sox <dig> gene is required for the differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells to chondrocytes and, together with the related l-sox <dig> and sox <dig> proteins, controls chondrocyte-specific gene expression  <cit> . sox <dig> also inhibits terminal differentiation of chondrocytes to the hypertrophic phenotype  <cit> . in contrast, the runx <dig> gene  is essential for differentiation of osteoblasts, but also promotes hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation  <cit> .

in addition to these key regulators of chondrocyte maturation, numerous other transcription factors have been implicated in this process. one example is the activating transcription factor/cyclicamp response element-binding protein  family that is defined by the ability of its members to bind to the cyclicamp response element  in target promoters. mice with inactivation of the atf <dig> gene display chondrodysplasia and reduced chondrocyte proliferation  <cit> , a similar phenotype to transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant-negative form of creb in cartilage  <cit> . we and others have shown that atf <dig> and creb regulate the transcription of the cell cycle genes cyclin d <dig> and cyclin a in chondrocytes through cre-dependent mechanisms  <cit> . however, the atf/creb family contains additional members  <cit> , some of which  act as transcriptional repressors. these repressors could down-regulate cre-dependent transcription and thus cause delay of cell cycle progression and/or promote cell cycle exit during terminal differentiation.

atf <dig> expression has been shown to be induced by a large variety of cellular stresses, including radiation, dna-damaging agents, adenoviral infection and others  <cit> . recent evidence also suggests induction of atf <dig> by a number of physiological stimuli such as growth hormone  <cit> , transforming growth factor β <cit>  and ligands for several g-protein-coupled receptors  <cit> . in some instances , atf <dig> has been shown to activate transcription  <cit> . however, in most cases atf <dig> has been found to repress transcription of target genes  <cit> . similarly, the effects of atf <dig> on cellular physiology appear to be very context- and cell type-dependent; for example, atf <dig> has been shown to both promote  <cit>  and inhibit  <cit>  cellular proliferation and cell cycle progression, and to have both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects  <cit> .

we recently performed microarray analyses of an in vitro system of mouse chondrocyte differentiation in three-dimensional micromass cultures  <cit> . we now extended these studies and demonstrated that numerous atf/creb family members are expressed in chondrocytes. most notably, atf <dig> expression is markedly upregulated during chondrocyte differentiation. validation of atf <dig> expression and functional studies strongly suggest an important role for atf <dig> in cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation.

RESULTS
atf <dig> mrna levels increase during chondrocyte differentiation
based on the prominent role of atf <dig>  and creb  in cartilage development, we analyzed the expression of atf-creb family members in our transcriptional profiles of differentiating micromass cultures  <cit> . numerous family members were expressed during micromass differentiation . most genes, including atf <dig> and creb <dig>  did not display marked changes in expression during micromass differentiation, and no genes were down-regulated two-fold or more. however, atf <dig>  atf <dig>  atf <dig> and creb3l <dig> genes displayed upregulation towards the end of the time course. the strongest effects were observed for atf <dig> transcript levels that increased  <dig> -fold from day  <dig> to  <dig> of micromass culture . atf <dig>  atf <dig> and creb3l <dig> mrna levels increased  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold over the same period, respectively. because it showed the largest increase, we focused subsequent studies on the atf <dig> gene. we performed real-time pcr analyses of independent micromass cultures from mouse embryonic limb bud cells and demonstrated a strong increase of atf <dig> mrna expression during micromass differentiation, thus validating the microarray data .

to examine the expression of atf <dig> during chondrocyte differentiation in vivo, we dissected tibiae from embryonic day  <dig>  cd <dig> mice into the resting/proliferating, prehypertrophic and hypertrophic areas . rna was directly isolated from dissected tibiae, without subculturing of cells. real-time pcr analyses demonstrated expression of collagen ii  in the resting/proliferating area that declines significantly in the prehypertrophic and hypertrophic areas . in contrast, collagen x  mrna was virtually undetectable in the resting/proliferating area and increased strongly in the other zones . these expression profiles of known markers of early and late chondrocyte differentiation confirmed efficient separation of the different growth pate zones by microdissection. atf <dig> mrna levels increased more than five-fold from the resting/proliferating to the hypertrophic zone . atf <dig> expression thus displayed a similar pattern as col10a <dig>  although the induction was less pronounced for atf <dig> 

atf <dig> is upregulated by cytochalasin d, an inhibitor of actin polymerization
we had shown earlier that inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin d promotes chondrogenic differentiation  <cit> . thus, we examined whether cytochalasin d affects atf <dig> expression. indeed, incubation of primary chondrocytes with cytochalasin d caused a more than 30-fold induction of atf <dig> mrna levels . to examine whether this upregulation is due to transcriptional effects, primary chondrocytes were transfected with an atf <dig> promoter – firefly luciferase construct. cytochalasin d treatment resulted in five-fold upregulation of atf <dig> promoter activity . thus, cytochalasin d induces atf <dig> through transcriptional mechanisms, at least in part.

atf <dig> represses sox9-dependent and increases runx2-dependent transcription
we next asked whether increased expression of atf <dig> affects chondrocyte-specific gene expression. primary chondrocytes were cotransfected with reporter vectors for sox <dig> and runx <dig> activity and an atf <dig> expression vector. overexpression of atf <dig> resulted in an approximately  <dig> % reduction in sox9-dependent transcription  and an  <dig> % increase in runx2-dependent transcription , suggesting that upregulation of atf <dig> can promote the transition from proliferating to hypertrophic chondrocytes.

atf <dig> represses transcription of the cyclin d <dig> and cyclina genes
atf <dig> acts as a transcriptional repressor through the cre. we had demonstrated a requirement for the cre for maximal activity of the cyclin d <dig> and cyclin a promoters in chondrocytes  <cit> . we thus examined the effects of atf <dig> overexpression on cre-dependent transcription and the activity of these two cyclin promoters. transient transfection of an atf <dig> expression plasmid decreased the activity of the cre-dependent reporter by approximately  <dig> %  and cyclin d <dig> promoter activity by  <dig> % . atf <dig> overexpression most strongly repressed cyclin a promoter activity which decreased to less than 10% of control values . to determine whether the effects of atf <dig> on cyclin a transcription were mediated by the cre, we performed parallel experiments using a cyclin a promoter construct with a mutated cre . atf <dig> overexpression did not affect activity of this promoter fragment, suggesting that atf <dig> represses cyclin a transcription directly through the cre.

discussion
this study is the first to demonstrate an important role of atf <dig> in the control of endochondral bone growth and skeletal development. our data demonstrate upregulation of atf <dig> during chondrogenic differentiation in vivo and in vitro. atf <dig> expression is known to be induced by a number of different cellular stressors, including hypoxia  <cit> . hypoxia has been demonstrated in the cartilage growth plate in vivo  <cit> , raising the possibility that low oxygen tension is one of the physiological inducers of atf <dig> in developing cartilage. interestingly, two of the other atf/creb family members found to be upregulated in our studies, atf <dig> and creb3l <dig> , have also been shown to be induced by cellular stress   <cit> . these data suggest that upregulation of stress-responsive transcription factors is a common theme during late stage chondrogenic differentiation in micromass culture. since atf <dig> transcript levels display similar upregulation during chondrocyte differentiation in vivo, this pattern does not appear to be an artifact of the micromass culture system, but to reflect the physiological processes of cartilage development.

atf <dig> and creb, the prototype members of the atf-creb family, have been shown to play crucial roles in chondrocyte cell cycle gene expression and proliferation  <cit> . while their activities are essential to ensure adequate rates of proliferation, physiological bone development also requires regulated cell cycle exit and onset of postmitotic chondrocyte differentiation. these requirements necessitate tight control of atf <dig> and creb activity that can be achieved through several mechanisms. for example, both transcription factors are regulated by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation. changes in phosphorylation status could therefore repress their activity when chondrocytes exit the proliferative phase. for example, we and others have shown that extracellular signals such as transforming growth factor β, parathyroid hormone-related peptide and prostaglandins induce phosphorylation of atf <dig> and creb in chondrocytes, respectively  <cit> . our data presented here also suggest that atf <dig> and creb <dig> mrna levels do not change during chondrocyte differentiation, suggesting that they are regulated at the posttranscriptional level . another possibility to limit atf2/creb activity is the expression of transcriptional repressors that compete with them for binding elements on target genes. one such repressor is atf <dig>  <cit> .

our data show that atf <dig> mrna expression is markedly upregulated during chondrocyte differentiation in a three-dimensional micromass culture system in vitro and in mouse embryonic tibiae in vivo. in addition, atf <dig> is strongly induced in response to cytochalasin d, an actin-modifying drug that induces early  <cit>  and late  chondrocyte differentiation. our transient transfection assays demonstrate that the induction of atf <dig> expression by cytochalasin d occurs, at least in part, at the transcriptional level; however, induction of mrna levels is markedly higher than stimulation of promoter activity. this could be due to posttranscriptional mechanisms such as increased mrna stability as has been described for atf <dig> before  <cit> . alternatively, transcriptional activation of the endogenous atf <dig> gene through promoter/enhancer elements not present in our reporter plasmid is possible.

the expression pattern of atf <dig> is therefore consistent with a function during cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. furthermore, our data suggest that atf <dig> represses cre-dependent transcription, for example the activity of the cyclin d <dig> and cyclin a promoters. we have shown earlier that the activities of these promoters correlates with the corresponding protein levels in chondrocytes  <cit> . induction of atf <dig> should therefore result in reduced levels of these cyclins and other atf2/creb targets. the cyclin a promoter showed a much stronger response to atf <dig> overexpression than the cyclin d <dig> promoter and the cre reporter. the most plausible explanation for this difference is that the cyclin a promoter, in addition to direct regulation through the cre, is also controlled by upstream cell cycle proteins such as cyclin d <dig> and e2f  <cit> . reduced cyclin d <dig> levels and e2f activity in response to atf <dig> overexpression could therefore contribute to the observed strong downregulation of cyclin a transcription by atf <dig> 

mutation of the cre in the cyclin a promoter completely abolished the response to atf <dig> overexpression, providing strong evidence that the effects of atf <dig> on cyclin a transcription are mediated by direct binding to the cre. interestingly, overexpression of atf <dig> repressed cyclin a promoter more than mutation of cre. this suggests that binding of atf <dig> to the cre also suppresses the activity of other elements in the promoter, for example the e2f response element discussed above.

in growth plate physiology, sox <dig> suppresses and runx <dig> promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy. in this study, we observed repression of sox <dig> activity and enhancement of runx <dig> activity in response to atf <dig> overexpression, in agreement with the postmitotic role of atf <dig> suggested by us. however, the mechanism involved remain to be elucidated. one possibility is that atf <dig>  indirectly or directly, regulates expression of sox <dig> and/or runx <dig>  or required cofactors. a second possibility is that atf <dig> physically interacts with each or both of these factors, thereby modulating their activity. both sox <dig> and runx <dig> are known to undergo protein-protein interactions with many other transcription factors. for example, sox <dig> has been shown to interact with c-maf  <cit> , steroidogenic factor  <dig>  <cit>  and β-catenin  <cit> . runx <dig> has been shown to interact with, among others, nrf <dig>  <cit>  and smad  <cit>  proteins. most notably, runx <dig> has been demonstrated to bind to atf <dig>  another member of the atf/creb family, although this interaction appears to be indirect  <cit> . a third possibility is that the effects of atf <dig> on sox <dig> and runx <dig> activity are secondary to atf3's effect on cell cycle progression. it has been shown that runx <dig> activity fluctuates throughout the cell cycle and is controlled by the cell cycle machinery  <cit> . for example, cyclin d <dig> together with cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> has been shown to promote ubiquitination and degradation of runx <dig>  <cit> . repression of cyclin d <dig> expression by atf <dig> would thus result in stabilization of runx <dig> and increased differentiation. our model for the effects of atf <dig> on chondrocyte cell cycle gene expression and runx <dig> activity is illustrated in fig.  <dig>  to our knowledge, no cell cycle control mechanisms for sox <dig> activity have been reported, but are conceivable.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study identifies atf <dig> as a novel player in the complex networks controlling growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. induction of atf <dig> expression by differentiation stimuli is likely to contribute to the coordination of cell cycle exit and hypertrophic differentiation during endochondral bone growth. analyses of the in vivo roles of atf <dig> in endochondral ossification and identification of the physiological inducers and target genes of atf <dig> during skeletogenesis will be important steps towards a better understanding of cartilage development.
