BACKGROUND
the researches on mechanism, function and evolution of plant secondary metabolism were traced back to about 60 years ago
 <cit> . secondary metabolic pathways lead to tens of thousands of products involved in various biological responding processes, under stimuli of specific external environmental stress elicitors as well as signal molecules of normal growth and development
 <cit> . secondary metabolisms of arabidopsis are classified into five major groups : nitrogen-containing secondary compounds biosynthesis , terpenoids biosynthesis , sugar derivatives biosynthesis , phenylpropanoid derivatives biosynthesis  and flavonoids biosynthesis  in aracyc database
 <cit> . most nitrogen containing compounds, playing important roles in biological responses in plant defense and human nutrition
 <cit> , are regulated by myb and bhlh members in transcription levels
 <cit> . sugar secondary derivatives, members of low molecular weight metabolites , are associated with osmotic stress in higher plants
 <cit> . phenylpropanoids are constitutive compounds in certain tissues
 <cit>  or responding factors induced by stresses 
 <cit> . and these metabolites are regulated by atmyb <dig> , atmyb <dig> , hy <dig> , and cip <dig> 
 <cit> . flavonoids, a major metabolic branch derived from phenylalanine and malonyl coenzyme a, are regulated by myb and bhlh family members
 <cit> . terpenoids, the largest secondary metabolic family irreplaceable in inner communication with: environment; plant growth; and development
 <cit> , are regulated by ap2/erf, bhlh and myb members
 <cit> . the significant functions of these compounds make their regulators critical targets in genetic engineering applications for improving plant qualities, and for enzymes engineering tf is one kind of candidates
 <cit> . however, metabolic engineering primarily concentrates on production of only one metabolite or a single metabolic gene and normally generates unexpected metabolic consequences–because metabolic pathways in plant intertwine one another to form a complex network; and perturbation of a single gene in the network usually have extensively effects on metabolic flux
 <cit> . therefore, regulatory mechanisms of biosynthetic genes are too complex to comprehensively reveal because of ‘biodiversity’ or ‘chemodiversity’, asking for system analysis rather than independent experiments.

the first sequenced flowering plant arabidopsis thaliana is widely used as a model to systematically study gene function and physiology in plant science
 <cit> . with high-throughput technologies such as microarray, chip-chip etc., numerous data have been generated in this model plant, making it possible to explore biological mechanisms in plant developmental and environmental responses on genomic scale. among these technologies, gene microarray aims to investigate expression of genes on a large scale in various treatments or developmental stages
 <cit> . many approaches used microarrays in systematic analysis of regulation over whole genome. for instance, bayesian was applied to build dynamic regulatory network over time series microarrays, presuming causal relationships between tfs and target genes
 <cit> . other studies generated co-expression data from microarrays and then utilized function specific cis-elements  to reconstruct regulatory network, assuming that co-expressed genes are co-regulated by the same tfs
 <cit> . also, researchers used microarrays in expression quantitative trait locus  analysis to identify hot spot regions where regulatory genes locate. for example, researchers built genetic regulatory network in flowering and single gene mutants in arabidopsis
 <cit>  and identified effects of tfs on multiple metabolic phenotypes
 <cit> . however, these studies focusing on regulatory network–mainly stress  or development  specific
 <cit> –are limited in: types of experiments, sizes of networks, families of tfs and numbers of target genes. besides, most available regulatory databases only addressed on their particular regulatory information . these limitations in regulatory network analysis and database specificity make it insufficient to systemically study regulatory mechanism–neglecting dynamic changes, biological responses and regulatory rewiring or crosstalk between regulations. however, systematic researches of transcriptional regulations on metabolic pathways are still fewer than function studies 
 <cit> .therefore, we developed a method to construct a dynamic regulatory network significant in biological function by integrating regulatory interactions, large-scale microarray data and evolutionary conservation of tfbss . this dynamic network is efficient in systematically exploring regulatory rewiring  on pathways to explain the mechanism of regulation. we investigated the regulatory rewiring with expression, network topology and upstream signaling pathways, which largely improves the understanding of perplexed regulatory rewiring mechanism in secondary metabolism.

RESULTS
dynamic regulatory network reconstruction with co-expression data and regulatory interactions
we reconstructed the regulatory network of secondary metabolism in arabidopsis thaliana through combining co-expressed gene pairs with regulatory interactions : either  <dig>  predicted regulatory interactions from athamap
 <cit> , which were then filtered by conserved transcription factor binding sites ; or  <dig>  directly experiment-proved ones from agris
 <cit> .

we first used conserved tfbss  to increase the confidence of regulatory interactions predicted in athamap from the perspective of evolution. as expected, poplar  had more conserved tfbss. in contrast, we did not find any conserved tfbss among tb orthologous genes in chlamydomonas –possibly owing to large evolutionary distance between them. this verifies the rationale of our results in conserved tfbss computing.next,  <dig> , <dig> significantly co-expressed gene pairs and  <dig> , <dig> most significantly co-expressed gene pairs were obtained from microarray analysis . based on these co-expressed gene pairs, we identified a substantial amount of active regulatory interactions to construct regulatory network. 28% of regulatory interactions from athamap were maintained after being filtered with significantly co-expressed gene pairs. at the same time, among the regulatory interactions from agris database, about 39% were significantly co-expressed and 6% were most significantly co-expressed–consistent with the fundamental assumption of regulatory interaction prediction: expression patterns of tfs and their target genes were similar.to validate our filtering strategies of athamap data, we compared the proportion of direct regulatory interactions  in the predicted ones  across different data filtering strategies  with five tfs: fus <dig> , atlec <dig> , ag , agl <dig>  and hy <dig>  in both agris and athamap. after being filtered by only tfbss alignments or significant co-expressed gene pairs, the percentages of direct regulatory interactions were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. when being filtered by both tfbss alignments and significantly co-expressed gene pairs, the fraction of direct regulatory interactions increased to  <dig> %. after adding evolutionary conservation filtering, this percentage reached  <dig> %. therefore, our filtering methods were efficient in predicting highly confident regulatory interactions.

to verify that our processed regulatory interactions are more confident than raw regulatory interactions, we first compared the numbers of target pathways in these two datasets. we observed that the numbers of target pathways in our result were smaller than that in both raw dataset and random dataset . and the raw dataset was not significantly different from random dataset compared with our processed data . furthermore, to validate the reliability of our proposed method in eliminating low confident data in raw dataset, we mined function of pathways  from literatures and checked their consistency with tfs’ mutant-phenotypes in atpid database
 <cit> . here we only chose tfs with simple mutant-phenotypes  to make the result more precise, ignoring complex mutant-phenotypes associated with multiple functions. the percentages of literature evidences in our processed data were higher than that in the raw dataset : for each tf, functions of more than half target pathways in processed regulatory interactions were correlated with mutant-phenotype. in our results, cdc <dig>  regulated  <dig> pathways, and  <dig> of them were correlated with embryo development in literatures–in accordance with embryonic defect, the phenotype of cdc <dig> mutant in atpid. agl <dig> , whose mutant-phenotype was about flowers in atpid, regulated  <dig> pathways in our result, and  <dig> of target pathways were associated with flowers in literatures. atlec <dig> mutant affected normal embryonic and cotyledonal development in atpid,  <dig> of the  <dig> pathways which were predicted to be regulated by atlec <dig> were related to this tf’s mutant-phenotype. these results indicate that our method is efficient in identifying highly confident regulatory interactions from raw dataset.

regulatory rewiring under diverse conditions in tb
based on the dynamic regulatory network, we analyzed regulatory rewiring to demonstrate the dynamic changes of regulation. in pathway level, according to the regulation of tfs on target genes, we classified regulations into three types: positive, negative or both positive and negative. positive or negative regulation of a tf on a pathway signifies that the regulations on different pathway genes are constant and don’t change with experiments. both positive and negative regulation, considered as inconstant and reciprocal regulation on different target enzymatic genes, maintains the balance of metabolic flux within pathways. for example, abscisic acid glucose ester biosynthesis contains only one reaction, and the reaction is catalyzed by abscisic acid glucosyltransferase that is encoded by more than  <dig> genes. we found both positive and negative regulations of rav <dig>  on this pathway, which could keep abscisic acid glucosyltransferase steady.

since tb is critical to plant, we took two examples in tb sub-network to illustrate regulatory rewiring under diverse experimental conditions. generally, the occurrence of rewiring is caused by either regulatory interactions between tfs or regulatory alterations under different conditions.

one example is the rewiring between the regulatory crosstalk of rav <dig> and athb <dig>  on hmg <dig> . rav <dig> positively regulated hmg <dig> gene in independence  under many conditions: the grown stage of leaves; tocopherols mutant vte <dig>  gene; tocopherols mutant vte <dig>  gene; leaves responses to phytophthora infestans and cop <dig>  signalosome mutants grown in dark, etc. however, the positive regulation role of rav <dig> on hmg <dig> gene altered when athb <dig> promoted the expression of hmg <dig> gene  under a few conditions, like aba <dig>  gene mutant and hypoxia stress. we found that the distance between two tfs’ binding sites of hmg <dig> gene was within 200 bps, suggesting that the binding of athb <dig> on hmg <dig> gene affect normal binding of rav <dig>  and thereby change rav1’s usual regulatory function. it implies that the interactions between these two tfs result in the alteration of rav <dig> regulation on hmg <dig> gene.

the example of epoxysqualene biosynthesis also demonstrates the rewiring of regulatory crosstalk . epoxysqualene biosynthesis pathway is the upstream pathway, leading to sterol biosynthesis  and other triterpenoids biosynthesis. the regulations of rav <dig> on epoxysqualene biosynthesis and sterol biosynthesis pathways were the same in multiple experiments: phytophthora infestans plants, water treatment on leaves for 24 hours, mgcl <dig> treatment on leaves for 12 hours, etc. but rav <dig> regulated the two pathways differently under a few conditions : negatively regulated epoxysqualene biosynthesis but positively regulated sterol biosynthesis, because of the activation of some downstream biosynthetic genes regulated by rav <dig> in sterol biosynthesis pathway. the change of rav1’s regulation would affect normal metabolic distribution of sterol-related and the other triterpenoids, indicating the importance of regulatory rewiring in controlling metabolic flux.

variability of genes’ expressions revealing regulatory rewiring
significant variability in expressions of tf-encoding and pathway genes could further reveal regulatory rewiring by providing gene activities and functions specific to experimental conditions. we investigated the changes of gene activities and functions through differentially expressed genes  .biosynthetic genes of fb, pdb and tb were significantly differentially expressed in tissue experiments , suggesting their dramatic changes in biological development of specific tissues. on the contrary, genes in nscb were significantly differentially expressed in genotype experiments, indicating notable activities and biological function of nitrogen-containing compounds in plants of different genotypes.

the expressions of tf-encoding genes were also different under different experimental conditions. on one hand, genes–primary in wrky, nac, ap2/erebp and myb tf families–were widely differentially expressed , indicating their global roles in regulations of downstream tfs or target enzymatic genes. in wrky family, wrky <dig>  and wrky <dig>  
 <cit> , were greatly differentially expressed in genotype and chemical experiments; whereas wrky <dig> 
 <cit>  was significantly differentially expressed in tissue and chemical treatments. compared with wrky family, stress induced nac family members 
 <cit>  were differentially expressed in grown stages. on the other hand, tfs only differentially expressed in a few experiments included e2f/dp family 
 <cit> , c2h <dig> family 
 <cit>  and abi3/vp <dig> family 
 <cit> . those tfs were possibly more specific to particular conditions. for instance, a member of e2f/dp family  was more specific to genotype experiments; whereas a member of c2h <dig> family  was more typical to tissues.

to explore the relationship between tfs and pathway genes, we clustered them by expression profiles under different experiment categories and took tb as an example . firstly, we could not distinguish tfs and biosynthetic genes by two separated clusters. secondly, one cluster was a union of similarly expressed genes, and contained both tfs and enzymatic genes, suggesting potential regulations between them in a cluster. thirdly, clusters were different under five experiment categories, indicating variability of potential regulations depending on experimental conditions. this variability reflects biodiversity to a certain extent, which is in accordance with regulatory rewiring–emphasizing the reasons of biological complexity.

explanation of regulatory rewiring by network topology
network topological properties could efficiently explain regulatory rewiring based on network structure . we compared the general network properties of five secondary metabolic classes . the numbers of tfs, genes and regulatory interactions in tb were the highest, indicating that the regulation of tb was the most complicated. in contrast, these topology properties in sdb were the lowest, revealing that the regulation of sdb was the simplest. the number of positive regulations was larger than that of negative regulations, and the number of inconsistent regulations was the least, which was discovered in network motifs as well. in addition, the network motifs  with high frequencies contained more positive regulations than negative regulations and inconsistent regulations, showing that most regulations were invariant .

fb, flavonoids biosynthesis; nscb, nitrogen-containing secondary compounds biosynthesis; pdb, phenylpropanoid derivatives biosynthesis; sdb, sugar derivatives biosynthesis; tb, terpenoids biosynthesis; tfs, transcription factor; average degree, the mean value of nodes’ degree to present network density.

since high degree nodes are important in maintaining network structure whereas closeness gives a rough indication of how well a node connects the network, we used degree and closeness to explore the functions of pathways and tfs. we found that the nodes with high degree were also high in closeness . interestingly, almost all nodes with both high degrees and closeness were tfs, while pathways always had low degree and closeness, indicating that tfs play a key role in maintaining the structure of network.

it is intriguing which factor affects the numbers of tfs in network. we discovered that the number of tfs was correlated with the number of genes in this pathway : the fewer genes in a pathway, the fewer tfs regulating this pathway, suggesting simpler regulation of this pathway. besides, similar distributions of tfs’ numbers  and pathway genes’ numbers  in terpenoids metabolism also demonstrate the relevance; and the two numbers were all correlated with topological property. for example, one gene pathways  were regulated by a small number of tfs, indicating simple regulations; and these pathways were not critical to metabolic network, because of their low degrees in topology . however, pathways with more genes  were regulated by more than  <dig> tfs and were hub pathways in terpeniod metabolism . the regulations of these pathways were complicated so that perplexing regulatory rewiring often occurred and led metabolic fluxes flowing into disparate downstream pathways. in other words, regulatory rewiring happened with changing conditions, and in turn affected metabolic flux within inner pathway or between different downstream pathways. these examples demonstrate that both simple and complex regulations can adapt to function of metabolic pathways, either specific or extensive.

contribution of tfs’ upstream signaling pathways to regulatory rewiring
since signaling pathways regulate the activities of tfs, they contribute to tf’s regulatory rewiring. to define upstream signaling influences on tfs, we computed significances of expression correlations between plant signaling pathway genes and tfs . plant signaling molecules are mainly metabolites, such as jasmonate , ethylene , brassinosteroid  and cytokinin . we found that tfs involved in certain signaling pathways were truly significantly co-expressed with related signaling pathway genes. for example, atmyc <dig> , in the downstream of jasmonate signaling pathway, was significantly correlated with genes in this pathway; arr <dig>  and arr <dig> , activated by cytokinin indirectly, were significantly co-expressed with cytokinin signaling pathway genes. these results indicate the efficiency of predicting tfs’ upstream signaling pathways. totally we found that  <dig> tfs were significantly correlated with  <dig> signaling pathways . among the three signaling pathways, jasmonate and cytokinin signaling pathways were correlated with  <dig> tfs and  <dig> tfs respectively while ethylene signaling pathway was only correlated with  <dig> tfs: suggesting global regulatory function of jasmonate and cytokinin compared to ethylene. in addition,  <dig> tfs were correlated with three signaling pathways, and  <dig> tfs were associated with both jasmonate and cytokinin signaling pathways–indicating complicated regulations of signaling pathways on these tfs. besides, the rest  <dig> tfs were correlated with only one signaling pathway, implying specific regulations of signaling pathways on these tfs. for example, rav <dig> was significantly correlated with cytokinin signaling pathway, demonstrating potential regulation of cytokinin on rav <dig>  here, the identification and summary of potential signaling pathways for tfs could largely improve the understanding of tfs’ regulatory rewiring.

discussion
here we presented a method to construct dynamic regulatory network of secondary metabolic pathways. based on the dynamic regulatory network, we systematically explored complicated regulatory rewiring or crosstalk occurring under distinct experimental conditions, and investigated the relationships between regulatory rewiring and expression, network topology and signaling pathway to unveil the complex regulatory mechanism. the major assumption of our method is that active regulatory interactions are co-expressed which was also applied in previous studies
 <cit> . the activation and inhibition effects can be distinguished by correlation coefficient of tfs and their target genes. our method of integrating multiple data is efficient in identifying high confident regulatory interactions. as described in result, regulatory interactions determined by three types of data were more reliable than those predicted by single or two type of data. however, most significant co-expression relations are not efficient in prediction because strict criteria of co-expression would filter out gene pairs only co-expressed in a few experiments .

based on regulatory alterations at pathway level , we mined regulatory rewiring to comprehensively understand the regulation mechanism of biological metabolic fluxes. for instance, co-regulation of two pathways may attribute to multi-functions of pathway genes shared by these two pathways. besides, some tfs were considered as dominant regulators because of their frequently changed activities: such as rav <dig>  which widely regulates growth and developmental genes in arabidopsis
 <cit> . furthermore, our result explained the mechanism of tfs regulation on metabolic pathways. for example, flavonoid biosynthesis is influenced by atlec <dig>  hy <dig> and agl15
 <cit> . based on our result we discovered these tfs’ potential target genes, encoding flavanone 3β-hydroxylase, acetyl-coa synthetase, 4-coumarate-coa ligase and naringenin chalcone synthase. and the target genes encoding flavanone 3β-hydroxylase and 4-coumarate-coa ligase could contribute to regulatory rewiring of hy <dig>  while genes encoding 4-coumarate-coa ligase and acetyl-coa synthetase might be the reason of agl15’s regulatory rewiring.

moreover, our work benefits plant metabolic engineering. a persuasive example is the regulatory crosstalk in abscisic acid metabolism . abscisic acid biosynthesis is followed by two downstream pathways, abscisic acid glucose ester biosynthesis and phaseic acid biosynthesis. the three pathways are regulated differently by both tga <dig> and athb1: tga <dig> positively regulates three pathways, whereas athb <dig> negatively regulates phaseic acid biosynthesis and positively regulates the other pathways. athb <dig> and tga <dig> reciprocally regulate cyp707a <dig>  gene in phaseic acid biosynthesis pathway; and the distance between two tfs’ binding sites on cyp707a <dig> promoter is within 200 bps–indicating spatial physical effects of the two tfs on their normal binding processes
 <cit> . besides, regulation of athb <dig> on three pathways cooperates with its negative regulation on tga1’s expression, suggesting athb <dig> should be a key factor in abscisic acid metabolic regulation. practically, we could overexpress athb <dig> to increase the yield of abscisic acid glucose ester 
 <cit>  and inhibit phaseic acid metabolic branch at the same time. in conclusion, this example of pathway crosstalk provides a reference to biologists on how to control metabolic products to improve desired plant traits in metabolic engineering.

we also notice that some tfs are not included in our result. this limitation attributes to restricted data sources and incomplete knowledge of regulation mechanism. firstly, regulatory interactions collected from two databases are incomplete. for example, both athamap and agris databses didn’t collect some well-known tfs  and complete regulatory interactions . besides, the number of available microarrays is limited and insufficient to cover various experiments where tfs function–so that some tfs were filtered in microarrays analysis. secondly, even if data collected in the databases were complete, not all functional tfs can meet our basic assumption and show significance in co-expression, because present knowledge of regulation is unable to definitely identify how well tfs’ expressions reflect their function switches. therefore, the incompleteness of both data-collection and regulation mechanisms impacts the results, which is a common issue in systematic analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
this systematic network-based bioinformatics approach largely improves the understanding of perplexed regulatory rewiring mechanism in secondary metabolism and provides useful references for biological experiments, especially metabolic engineering. the approach of reconstructing regulatory network and analyzing regulatory rewiring can be applied to comprehend the whole metabolism in arabidopsis.
