BACKGROUND
sugarcane is a tropical crop with c <dig> photosynthetic metabolism and brazil is its main producer. world’s interest in bioethanol and sugarcane with high sucrose and biomass yield has increased continuously over the years. in fact, sugarcane is one of the most important crops used as sustainable feedstock for renewable energy, such as bio-electricity and bioethanol, in tropical and subtropical regions . worldwide, sugarcane is cultivated in  <dig> million ha and its average yield is  <dig>  tonnes/ha  <cit> . this crop is very efficient in intercepting solar energy and assimilating carbon into carbohydrates, which results in high sucrose accumulation  in its mature culms and high biomass production  <cit> . however, the current average yield is less than 20 % of the theoretical maximum estimated from mathematical models of plant growth and physiological processes  <cit> . photosynthesis plays a key role on biomass production and crop yield, however, our understanding about this important physiological process in sugarcane is more limited when compared to maize, another c <dig> species. this highlights the need for detailed sugarcane physiology studies, particularly on leaf photosynthesis. such efforts would aid bridging the gap between the average yield in the field and the theoretical maximum yield of sugarcane.

modern sugarcane originated from inter-specific hybridization between the parental species saccharum officinarum l.  and s. spontaneum l. . despite its economic importance, the complexity of the sugarcane genome  with its haploid genome size estimated of  <dig> mbp and high ploidy, aneuploidy and polymorphism,  <cit>  have limited the advances on the development of new varieties via molecular breeding approaches. classical breeding has been the only responsible for sugarcane varieties released in the last decades  <cit> , although some efforts exploiting genetic modification have been carried out . it is worth noting that, to the best of our knowledge, no transgenic line has been commercially released yet  <cit> .

sugarcane was brought to brazil in  <dig> and despite the enormous agronomic work to generate more productive lines, the understanding of the sugarcane physiology, especially in relation to its photosynthetic performance, is still lacking  <cit> . modern cultivars have been selected mainly for characteristics based on nutritional demand and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and not for photosynthetic activity, as has being done for the wheat and rice breeding programs  <cit> . recent studies indicate a positive correlation among photosynthesis, crop yield and biomass production, suggesting that increasing photosynthesis is a potential way to enhance sugarcane productivity .

in order to increase and/or manipulate sugarcane photosynthesis we must first understand the regulatory processes involved in c <dig> biochemistry  <cit> . c4-type photosynthetic metabolism is more efficient than the c3-type due to some physiological, biochemical and anatomical specific features  <cit> . species with c <dig> metabolism appeared independently at least  <dig> times during land plant evolution  <cit>  in a minimum of  <dig> monocot and dicot plant species around  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago, suggesting that relatively simple genetic and regulatory mechanisms can drive the conversion of a c <dig> phenotype into c <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, the mechanisms and regulatory players are not yet fully understood.

besides environmental factors, photosynthesis is also controlled by the sink strength balancing source supply and sink demand . in this context, the activity of enzymes and the expression of genes related to photosynthesis follow the source-sink relationship in sugarcane . consequently, many studies evaluating gene expression have focused mainly on the sink, i.e., sugarcane culm development, providing insights into culm maturation and sucrose accumulation . in contrast, only few studies have explored the physiological and biochemical causes of photosynthesis variation among cultivars and leaf types  <cit> .

leaves of grasses are excellent systems to study the establishment of c <dig> photosynthesis because there is a cellular developmental gradient along the leaf blade, with the basal cells being undifferentiated and immature and the cells towards the tip becoming more mature and specialized . the most studied c <dig> species is maize, with several works describing transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic differentiation along the leaf blade . leaf development has been studied in rice and compared to maize leaves in order to identify key regulatory components and metabolite profiles for c <dig> phenotype  <cit> . so far, there is no similar report on c <dig> species other than maize.

the molecular mechanisms for c <dig> leaf development are complex and this process in polyploid and aneuploid plants such as sugarcane remain largely unknown. in order to fill this gap, we have carried out a detailed study of sugarcane leaf to investigate molecular and physiological changes along the leaf blade segments representing different developmental stages. the approaches used in this work allowed us to identify differences in compounds and enzymes responsible for the variable photosynthetic capacity among leaf segments, and several relevant genes that might be subjected to further studies in order to increase photosynthesis and productivity.

RESULTS
leaf sampling
despite being clonally propagated, sugarcane has a heterogeneous germination rate and initial vegetative growth. in order to standardize our experiment, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the plant age at which the highest number of leaves would have the same length and also guarantee that all stalk reserves have been consumed in a way that the plants were solely dependent on photosynthesis for growth. the length distribution of leaf + <dig>  of 60 day-old plants is depicted on figure s <dig> . leaves with length between  <dig>  and 57 cm had the highest frequency  and this group was considered nearly homogenous and harvested for further analysis. the plant phenotype is shown in figure s <dig> . additionally, to overcome the length difference, even in the homogeneous population, we collected leaf segments taking into account the proportion of each segment on each length and not a fixed distance from the base of the leaf. the segments were named base “zero” ; base ; middle  and tip  .

physiological and biochemical evaluations
in order to characterize sugarcane leaf segments, several physiological and biochemical evaluations were performed. we used intact leaves and were able to evaluate gas exchange and photochemistry only on the b and m segments. due to technical limitations, it was not possible to carry out those measurements on the b <dig> and t . full details on the methods are available on additional file  <dig> and the results are shown in figures s <dig> and s <dig> .

the photosynthetic response to light revealed significant differences between leaf segments. the leaf b segment showed light saturation under lower light intensities as compared to the m , indicating differential photosynthetic capacity among these segments. on the other hand, the initial slope of the light response curve and the psii yield  suggested that the photochemistry is similar between the b and m segments. together, these data revealed a possible metabolic rather than photochemical limitation in carbon fixation among leaf segments. the apparent electron transport rate - etr -  also supports this idea. the relation between etr and photosynthesis -a -  represents the amount of electron transport through psii per co <dig> fixed and increased values suggest an activation of alternative electron sinks such as the mehler reaction and nitrogen  metabolism  <cit> .

photosynthetic response to co <dig> was used to estimate some biochemical traits and indicated that the previously mentioned metabolic limitation was caused by differences in pepcase activity and not rubisco . although total carbon content was similar between leaf segments , there were significant differences in carbon isotope discrimination among them . carbon isotope discrimination has been used to characterize c <dig> photosynthetic responses in plants growing under diverse environments and stresses . c <dig> plants have lower ∆13c than c <dig> plants, mainly because pepcase has lower discrimination for 13c as compared to rubisco  <cit> . carbon isotope discrimination showed that the b <dig> and b segments presented higher ∆13c than m and t. the ∆13c variation in c <dig> plants is related to radiation intensity in maize, miscanthus giganthus and flaveria bidentis, which displayed higher ∆13c when cultivated under low light when compared to leaves exposed to high light . this difference has been usually interpreted as a result of the leakiness or due to an inefficient c <dig> photosynthetic pathway. nevertheless, the metabolic difference between leaf segments in sugarcane cannot be associated with leakiness that varied from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at b and m, respectively. in addition, the b segment presented a lower k when compared to the m segment , corroborating to the fact that the b has a less efficient c <dig> biochemistry than the m and t segments. interestingly, while b <dig> and b had higher ∆13c than the rest of the leaf, the b segment showed lower photosynthetic rate  but similar psii yield as compared to the m segment . this reinforces our interpretation that the c <dig> biochemical inefficiency in basal portions is higher than in the other parts of the leaf.fig.  <dig> total carbon quantification  and carbon isotope discrimination  in sugarcane leaf segments: base “zero” , base , middle  and tip  sugarcane leaf segments. letters indicate statistical significance using anova followed by post hoc student t-test 



in order to investigate possible changes in pepcase and rubisco among the segments, immunoblotting and enzyme activity assays were performed. although immunoblotting of leaf extracts showed some variation between biological replicates from the same segment, differences in pepcase protein abundance were observed  with the highest amount being detected at the m segment. in addition, in vitro pepcase activity was significantly higher at the m in comparison to the other segments , validating the in vivo k estimation . for rubisco, the b <dig> segment was identified as the one with the lowest amount of both protein and activity . there was a tendency of increasing rubisco activity along the leaf blade, but statistical significance was only detected between the b <dig> and t segments. the rubisco activation state was also calculated as the ratio of initial activity to total activity but no substantial differences were detected among segments , corroborating also with in vivo vmax estimation .fig.  <dig> changes in activity and protein amount of carboxylation enzymes in sugarcane leaf segments: base “zero” , base , middle  and tip .  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase . letters indicate statistical significance using anova followed by post hoc student t-test ;  ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase . white bars represent initial activity and black bars total activity. lower case letters and capital letters indicate statistical significance using anova followed by post hoc student t-test  on initial and total activity, respectively. for the immunoblots the same amount of protein  was loaded for each sample. three independent biological replicates are shown for each segment



the number of stomata between leaf segments was similar when considering the adaxial and abaxial surfaces . this indicates that stomata density does not contribute to the variations observed at photosynthetic rates . although some studies reveal that stomatal density has a positive correlation with photosynthesis  <cit> , differences in photosynthesis along leaf blades of several c <dig> and c <dig> grasses were not explained by stomata density  <cit> .

n content increased along the leaf length and was higher at the m and t segments . these results are very similar to those found in the plant canopy, where the bottom leaves have lower n concentration than upper ones due to variations in light availability  <cit> . however, n investment on photosynthetic machinery was similar, with photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency  varying between  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mol mol- <dig> h- <dig> at the b segment and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mol mol- <dig> h- <dig> at the m segment. chlorophyll concentration was also higher on the m and t segments in comparison to the b <dig> and b , but those differences were not sufficient to bring about changes in photochemical activity among the leaf segments .fig.  <dig> total nitrogen quantification  and chlorophyll content  in sugarcane leaf segments: base “zero” , base , middle  and tip . letters indicate statistical significance using anova followed by post hoc student t-test 



the quantification of soluble sugars revealed a clear tendency of higher glucose, fructose and sucrose concentrations at the t when compared to the other segments . although the evaluated photosynthetic parameters showed significant differences between the b and m segments, they were not contrasting in terms of sugar content, the end products of photosynthesis. however, one should consider that sugar concentration in leaves is affected not only by current photosynthesis but also by its dynamic of consumption and exportation. interestingly, metabolite profiling in fifteen 1 cm-long maize leaf segments showed that glucose and fructose levels were higher in regions close to the base and decreased along the leaf blade towards the tip. sucrose, in contrast, presented a distinct behavior, with higher levels in segments close to the base and tip and lower levels in the middle regions  <cit> . myo-inositol showed a clear gradient of accumulation from b <dig> to the t segment . myo-inositol has a central role in plant metabolism and can be used as precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol, compatible solutes  and cell wall polysaccharides  <cit> . in maize leaves, myo-inositol levels present the same trend observed in sugarcane leaves  <cit> . together, our results suggest that the distribution of sugars along the sugarcane leaf is distinct from maize. however, any comparison between the two plant species must be regarded with caution. first, the age of the plants in the two studies are very different: while wang et al.  <cit>  have analyzed nine days-old maize leaves, the sugarcane plants in this study were two-months old. second, the authors used the third leaf  for maize, while for sugarcane we used the first leaf  with the dewlap fully exposed.table  <dig> quantification of soluble sugars

transcriptional profiling
rna-seq de novo transcript assembly and annotation
the mrnas from the segments  of four individuals were sequenced and on average  <dig>  million paired-end 100-bp strand-specific reads were obtained per segment and per individual , with a total of  <dig> million high quality reads . high quality reads were assembled with trinity  as described in methods. these data comprise  <dig>  correctly oriented transcripts or contigs that were kept for further analysis, as they appear to originate from viridiplantae or did not had any hits to nucleotide sequences in the ncbi databases . these  <dig>  contigs were grouped into  <dig>  loosely defined genes that could represent paralogous copies of the genes or copies from the homologous genomes. the average contig length was 878 bp with approximately 28 % of the contigs over 1kbp long, and the smallest contig with 283 bp;  <dig>  %  of the assembled contigs appear to code for proteins.  <dig>   contigs were annotated with trinotate and  <dig>  of these had gene ontology  terms assigned . the full set of de novo assembled contigs was compared to the full set of sorghum bicolor proteins and transcripts , using transrate . on one hand, around 31 % of the sugarcane contigs had a high confidence predicted homologue  in s. bicolor, when compared to the sorghum proteins, and 40 % when compared to the sorghum transcripts. on the other hand, 60 % of the sorghum proteins and 65 % of the sorghum transcripts have crbbs in sugarcane. we further inspected our transcriptome assembly using cegma, which has a set of  <dig> highly conserved eukaryotic genes that are usually present as single copy genes in many species. we were able to detect  <dig>  % of these genes as complete proteins or  <dig>  % when considering partial hits, with  <dig>  copies of each gene on average. we have assigned  <dig>  contigs into  <dig> kegg pathways  and identified  <dig>  contigs belonging to  <dig> transcription associated families, i.e., transcription factors or other transcriptional regulators, by applying the procedure described in perez-rodriguez et al.  <cit>  . we also identified  <dig>  groups of orthologous genes between the grasses saccharum spp. , oryza sativa, zea mays, sorghum bicolor and setaria italica  using orthomcl ;  <dig>  groups of orthologous genes are shared between the five species, more importantly  <dig>  groups of orthologues are shared between sugarcane and any of the other grasses representing  <dig>  sugarcane transcripts, with  <dig>  groups of orthologues present exclusively in sugarcane . these results show the overlap in protein space between these species, and highlights that our de novo sugarcane transcriptome assembly recovered a large proportion of the genes that are present in grasses .

analysis of transcript abundance and differential expression analyses
in this study, we aimed to generate a transcriptome resource to evaluate the developmental dynamics along the sugarcane leaf. for that, we estimated transcript abundances using express, read counts were analyzed in edger and normalized using the “trimmed mean of m values”  method  <cit> . comparisons between segments were performed subtracting distal from basal segments originating the three orthogonal contrasts: base vs. base "zero" ; middle vs. base ; tip vs. middle  . for this analysis we have summarized the read counts at the level of genes as defined above . the representation of the contrasts and the number of differentially expressed  genes are depicted on fig.  <dig>  the venn diagram shows that the leaf undergoes a drastic transcriptional rearrangement along the developmental gradient . this is even more evident when considering the number of de genes shared among the contrasts . only  <dig> genes were present in all contrasts  and almost 72 % of all de genes were present only in the t-m contrast . this is in agreement with majeran et al.  <cit>  and pick et al.  <cit> , who found higher the amount of transcripts and proteins toward the tip of maize leaves. we observed the same pattern on sugarcane, not only on transcripts number, but also by extracting and quantifying protein content .fig.  <dig> representation of the rna-seq contrasts between segments. each segment was compared against the previous one  originating three contrast: base - base "zero" ; middle – base ; tip – middle . the number of differentially expressed genes  is depicted under the arrows representing the contrasts. number of genes overexpressed on each segment considering different contrasts is shown above the graphic bars

considering the  <dig> differentially expressed genes that are present in all contrasts, we were able to identify four expression patterns along the leaf developmental gradient . the first pattern  is composed by the transcriptional factor tcp <dig>  that monotonically increased its expression from b <dig> to t segments. members of this family are involved with leaf morphogenesis and differentiation , arrest of cell division  <cit> , leaf elongation  <cit>  and auxin response  <cit> . to date, there is no information on the role of tcp <dig> in c <dig> plants and its expression profile in our dataset suggests that this gene can be an important player during leaf development.

ten genes from the second pattern  presented an opposite behavior, with high expression at b <dig> segment and decreasing expression towards the t segment. among them, we can point out the trichrome birefringence gene , which is important for o-acetylation of cell walls required for cellulose biosynthesis , and the gene encoding a 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime monooxygenase  involved in the production of a cyanogenic glycoside called dhurrin  <cit> . this compound has been related to drought tolerance in sorghum  <cit>  and to biotic stress response  <cit> . interestingly, dhurrin can also be regarded as an n storage molecule that peaks on early development stages in sorghum  <cit> . genes involved in carbohydrate and sterol metabolism were also classified into this pattern: the cell wall and vacuolar inhibitor of fructosidase  <dig>  responsible for post-transcriptional silencing of fructosidase activity and important in the development of photosynthetic apparatus, stress response and sugar signaling  <cit> ; and the cycloartenol-c-24-methyltranferase  <dig>  that catalyzes the initial step in biosynthesis of sterol, a class of compound with several regulatory roles in plant development  <cit> . sp803280_c87779_g <dig> code for an invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor ortholog of loc_os08g <dig>  and loc_os12g <dig>  in rice  <cit> , and thus might be involved in the remodeling of the plant cell wall. sp803280_c100769_g <dig>  coding for a dirigent protein ortholog to loc_os01g <dig>  and loc_os01g <dig>  in rice, involved in lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . an additional gene sp803280_c103567_g <dig> with orthologues in setaria, maize and sorghum, but not in rice is of unknown function, while sp803280_c88088_g <dig> and sp803280_c99583_g <dig> do not appear to code for proteins. in summary, genes that presented the second pattern are involved in early developmental processes and cell wall modification, corroborating with their expression on the most basal segment.

the pattern  <dig> was comprised by genes with lower expression at the m segment , like those encoding methylsterol monooxygenase 1– <dig>  and cysteine-rich repeat secretory protein  <dig> . methylsterol monooxygenase is involved in sterol metabolism  <cit> , important for membrane fluidity and membrane interaction with proteins and lipids  <cit> . arabidopsis has more than  <dig> genes coding for cysteine-rich repeat proteins making them one of the largest gene families. however, their role on plant metabolism is still to revealed  <cit> .

pattern  <dig>  is characterized by lower expression at b segment and had only one gene, encoding a naringenin, 2-oxoglutarate 3-dioxygenase . this protein participates in the flavonoids biosynthesis  <cit> , important for uv protection, defense against pathogens and pests, regulation of auxin transport and pigmentation  <cit> .

all those  <dig> genes were also used to validate rna-seq data by qrt-pcr using three biological replicates . the average coefficient of determination  between logcpm and logΔct was  <dig>  . genes with low expression values  had the lowest r <dig> correlation as reported before for genes with similar expression levels . however, it is worthwhile mentioning that despite these low r <dig> values, the general expression profile obtained by qrt-pcr resembled those obtained by rnaseq. we cannot ignore the pitfalls and artefacts of each technique, but one possible explanation might be the fact that we have a de novo transcriptome assembly of a crop with a complex polyploid genome that has not been sequenced yet. this represents an extra layer of difficulty when designing primers for qrt-pcr, as it is not possible to distinguish between all the alleles and paralogues, increasing the variability of qrt-pcr data.

we were also interested in comparing the transcriptional profile of sugarcane  to the one observed in another c <dig> species, maize . we compared the expression of over  <dig>  one-to-one orthologous genes between sugarcane and maize, identified by orthomcl , in a similar fashion as described by wang et al.  <cit>  . the expression profiles during leaf development between these two species were substantially different as the whole developmental gradient of the sugarcane leaf fits better into the distal half of the maize leaf .fig.  <dig> spearman correlation between fifteen segments along developmental gradient of maize leaves  and the four sugarcane leaf segments 



enrichment of gene ontology terms
a go enrichment analysis was performed by categorizing differentially regulated genes into go biological processes . each contrast was divided into two gene lists in order to evaluate the enrichment of biological processes. for instance, the contrast b-b <dig> was separated into positive log fc – genes more expressed at the b segment – and negative log fc – genes more expressed at the b <dig> segment). considering the contrast b-b <dig>  the most significant biological processes in b <dig> segment were those involved with cell wall organization and biosynthesis . it is noteworthy that wax metabolic processes , anatomical structure development , developmental process  and leaf formation  were also enriched terms in this segment . in the b segment, the most significant go terms were flavonoid biosynthetic and metabolic processes , redox process , cellular response to high light  and lipid metabolic process  .

the go enrichment analysis indicated that in the contrast m-b, genes related to dna modification  and n metabolism  were more expressed in the b segment . in the m segment, only two go ids were enriched , both related to flavonoid metabolism .

interestingly, the largest amount of de genes was found between the m and t, the segments that demonstrated the most similar behavior according to the physiological data. on the other hand, the m and b showed the smallest amount of de genes in spite of their differences in physiological behavior, especially photosynthetic capacity, carbon isotope discrimination and n content. considering the t-m contrast, the most overrepresented go ids in the m were those related to photosynthesis and redox processes  . the t segment presented the highest number of enriched terms related to amino sugar catabolic process , ion transport , transmembrane transport , zinc ion transport , cation transport  and anion transport  .

biochemical pathways
photosynthesis-related genes
it is already known that the c <dig> biochemical pathway is transcriptionally regulated  <cit>  under developmental  <cit>  and light  <cit>  control. in our study, only one nadp-dependent malic enzyme  was differentially expressed in the b0-b contrast . this indicates that co <dig> concentrating mechanism is still under development in the b <dig> segment, which is less exposed to light than the other ones. two phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases  were more expressed at the b segment . this enzyme has been reported as an important regulator of the aspartate metabolism in bundle sheath cells where aspartate is decarboxylated to pep by pepck and co <dig> supplied to the calvin-benson-brassham cycle  <cit> .

nevertheless, the contrast t-m showed the highest amount of photosynthesis related genes , and the majority of them was more expressed at the m segment such as enzymes of the calvin-benson-brassham cycle and proteins associated with chlorophyll and photosystems. interestingly, the expression of four pepcase genes was higher at the t segment in comparison to the m segment. this finding corroborates with the qpcr data reported by li et al.  <cit> , in which the transcript level of one pepcase increasing towards the tip of maize leaves. however, our immunoblotting and enzymatic assays revealed greater content and activity at the m segment  and decrease in both activity and content at the t. additionally, pepcase is known to undergo post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications  <cit>  and a recent study demonstrated that the spearman rank correlation  between mrna and protein abundance for genes related to photosynthesis on different sections of maize leaf was  <dig>  on average  <cit> , indicating that pepcase expression profile may not be an indication of more photosynthetically active tissue. one nadp-dependent malic enzyme was also more expressed at the t segment , corroborating with other reports that indicated its increase towards the tip  <cit> .table  <dig> photosynthesis related genes identified on each contrast

logfc: log fold change. positive logfc indicates more expression at the more basal segment of the contrast; negative logfc indicates more expression at the most distal segment of the contrast



the gene encoding a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  was expressed at the t segment and the expression of the arabidopsis homologue is increased under several stress conditions such as heat, anoxia and high sucrose concentration  <cit> . in fact, the t segment has lower leaf water content , which may lead to stress responses similar to oxidative stress in a similar fashion described by pick et al.  <cit>  for maize leaf tips. accordingly, many genes related to oxidative stress were expressed at the t segment.

sugars
genes related to carbohydrate metabolism are depicted on table  <dig>  analysis of the b-b <dig> contrast revealed that two genes  more expressed at the b <dig> segments encoded proteins involved in the synthesis of trehalose-6-phosphate , the phosphorylated intermediate of the non-reducing sugar trehalose. tre6p is considered a signal of sucrose availability and acts to maintain sucrose concentration within a proper range  <cit> . we have not quantified the levels of tre6p in our experiments, but sucrose content was similar at b <dig>  b and m segments . the above-mentioned genes encode tre6p synthase class ii proteins , which in arabidopsis thaliana do not have catalytic activity and are of unknown function  <cit> . in addition, a transcript related to sucrose metabolism  was also induced in the b <dig> segment.table  <dig> sugar-related genes identified on the contrast tip - middle 

logfc: log fold change. positive logfc indicates more expression at the t segment; negative logfc indicates more expression at the m segment



in the m-b contrast only one gene encoding an invertase  was more expressed in the m segment. the vast majority of de genes related to sugars was observed in the contrast t-m . several genes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism and interconversion of hexoses-phosphate were upregulated in the t segment. in addition, a gene coding for an inositol-3-phosphate synthase , a key enzyme in the conversion of glucose to myo-inositol  <cit> , was 2-fold more expressed in the t relative to m. such finding is in agreement with the concentration of this sugar alcohol at the t segment . two purple acid phosphatase  <dig> genes , responsible for the dephosphorylation of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate  have been upregulated in the t segment whereas only one gene  was more expressed in the m segment. furthermore, phosphoinositide phospholipase c <dig>  and phospholipase d  which participate on inositol signaling  <cit>  were more expressed in the m segment.

although many changes in transcripts related to enzymes of the sugar metabolism have been noticed, we could not directly link transcript abundance to the quantified sugars in most cases. a possible explanation is that other factors are influencing protein activity such as translation efficiency, protein assembly and degradation  <cit> .

cell wall biosynthesis and cell growth
several cell wall related genes were de in the tested contrasts , indicating cell wall modification along the leaf developmental gradient. among all identified genes, the ph-dependent cell wall loosening proteins known as expansins  <cit>  were more expressed in the b <dig>  and t  segments, indicating that the extreme opposite sides of the sugarcane leaf are under cell wall modification when compared to the other adjacent segments . cobra genes have an important role in cellulose synthesis  <cit> , and, together with cellulose synthase genes, were more expressed in the b <dig> and t segments. in the most basal segment , cellulose synthesis is expected to be part of secondary cell walls and structure of vascular system, whereas in the t segment we assume cell wall modifications due to senescence.

suberin is a heteropolymer formed by lipid and phenolic compounds  <cit>  deposited in the bundle sheath cells  <cit>  and may serve as a physical barrier to avoid co <dig> leakiness to the mesophyll cells  <cit> . although suberin biosynthetic and regulatory pathways have not been defined for monocots yet  <cit> , some reports identified few genes putatively involved in those processes  <cit> . suberin genes identified in all contrasts are listed at table s <dig> . nac and myb transcriptional family members might be involved in regulating secondary cell wall and suberin biosynthesis . most of these genes were up regulated in the b <dig>  and in b  segments and the contrast t-m  presented different expression patterns, indicating that suberization started at the basal portions of leaves before they become fully photosynthetically active.

transcription factors
our analysis identified  <dig>  genes belonging to  <dig> transcription factors or other transcriptional regulator families. enrichment analysis of each contrast  indicated that very few families, if any, were enriched in each segment. however, we could identify several transcriptional factors differentially expressed among segments .

the arf transcriptional factor family and the aux/iaa family of other transcriptional regulators are enriched at the b <dig> segment . they are involved in the regulation of auxin responsive genes and have several roles in plant development  <cit> , including leaf vascular differentiation  <cit> . several aux/iaa and arf genes are more expressed at the b <dig>  when considering the contrast b-b <dig>  aux/iaa and arf are also associated with stomatal development  <cit> . in maize,  <dig> members of this family have been identified  <cit> . we have identified  <dig> genes belonging to these two families in our rna-seq dataset, but we are not able to state how many more members there are in sugarcane due the lack of a complete sugarcane genome sequence.

members of bhlh and myb families, involved in leaf development, were also more expressed in the b <dig> segment . even though myb transcriptional factors are already known to regulate leaf development in tobacco  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> , bhlh might play a role in controlling the abaxial-adaxial polarity  <cit>  and stomatal development  <cit> .

in the leaf basis, the tcp family was enriched  and more expressed at the contrast b-b <dig> . this family has an important role in developmental processes by regulating cell division in vegetative and reproductive structures. in arabidopsis, tcp <dig> modulates cell cycle genes  <cit>  and is involved in leaf development and regulation of auxin and cytokinin homeostasis .

no transcription factor family was enriched in the b  and m  segments . on the other hand, the t segment was enriched in genes from the nac family , which has been associated with senescence in some plant species .

nitrogen assimilation and metabolism
n assimilation genes were up-regulated at the b <dig> segment . accordingly, wang et al.  <cit>  have reported that the leaf basal portions are responsible for n assimilation. the nitrate transporter gene , characterized in the classes of membrane proteins and involved in nitrate transport  <cit> , was upregulated in the b region. furthermore, the n concentration at b <dig> was lower than the others. the main genes associated to n metabolism and assimilation were more expressed in the m and t segments . the genes glutamate synthase  and glutamate dehydrogenase  <dig> , involved in glutamate biosynthesis from ammonium ions  <cit>  were upregulated in the m and t segments, respectively. the genes which participate in n metabolism from nitrate source, such as nitrate reductase  and nucleic acids  followed by recycling and mobilization of nutrients  <cit> . according to the transcriptional profile of different leaf segments, some genes and transcription factors  associated positively with the senescence pathway  were overexpressed in the t segment  as revealed in the contrast t-m . the gene for the blue copper-binding protein , considered a senescence associated gene - sag -  <cit> , had a significant increase in expression level in the t segment.

in the immature b <dig> segment, no differential expression of sags was noticed . however, we found a significant expression of gene encodig e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase atl <dig>  and e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase upl <dig> . these enzymes catalyze polyubiquitination and regulate leaf senescence negatively through ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of wrky <dig>  a key transcription factor of leaf senescence  <cit> . this result suggests that the basal segment is functional and mechanisms of senecence avoidence are active, as expected for a young and immature leaf portion.

there are several genes involved in the chlorophyll degradation pathway  <cit> , and some of them were identified as more expressed in the t . a first step to chlorophyll degradation is the change of chlorophyll–apoprotein complex structure and subsequent enzymatic breakdown of complex constituents by stay green proteins  <cit> . the gene that encodes the protein stay green  was more expressed in the t compared to the m segment, suggesting a possible beginning of senescence mechanism.

other pigments, such as carotenoids, are also degraded during leaf senescence. the gene encoding the enzyme carotenoid  <dig> -cleavage dioxygenase  responsible for the cleavage of carotenoids  <cit>  was also upregulated in the t segment. these results indicate that the leaf senescence process begins at the leaf tip and that chlorophyll and carotenoids degradation are associated  <cit> . although our analysis did not indicate chlorophyll degradation , it seems that the leaf tip, at the molecular level, presents indications of the onset of senescence.

the go enrichment analysis also revealed go terms associated with “aging” and “cell killing” overrepresented at the t segment . three 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase are on this list, responsible for an important step on ethylene production  <cit> . ethylene is a gaseous phytohormone and has an important role on the onset and progression of senescence  <cit> . the inhibition of its perception or biosynthesis in tobacco and tomato caused delayed onset of leaf senescence and lower expression of sags, which was also found in arabidopsis ethylene-insensitive mutants .

gene expression peaking at the middle section of the leaf
besides describing the physiological and transcriptional variation in sugarcane leaves, we also aimed to identify genes associated with high photosynthetic activity. to achieve this goal, we evaluated, amongst all genes expressed on our transcriptome, those that peaked their expression at the m segment, region with the highest photosynthetic capacity . for that, we utilized the software timesearcher  <cit>  using the z-values based on fpkm . we then looked for genes that had a normalized expression value  at the b <dig>  b and t segments lower than the average normalized expression for the m segment . in such a way, we identified  <dig> genes with expression values higher at the m segment and 26 % of which having functional annotation .

go enrichment analysis indicated that some pathways were enriched in the m segment , even though the number of genes on each pathway is small. some of them are related to starch and sucrose metabolism , amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism ; n metabolism  and plant hormone signal transduction .

from the genes directly related to photosynthesis, only two rubisco transcripts  presented higher expression at the m segment. however, our in vivo  and in vitro activities , and immunoblotting analysis  indicated no differences between segments . intriguingly, none pepcase transcript was identified in this analysis, contrasting with the physiological and biochemical assays . as mentioned before, pepcase gene is known to suffer both post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications  <cit> , which could justify such inconsistence between gene expression and protein activity and amount.

an aquaporin belonging to sip <dig> family  and the myb-related protein zm <dig>  were also identified. the silencing of the aquaporin homolog in arabidopsis has shown to decrease osmotic water permeability in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, mesophyll co <dig> conductance, photosynthesis, transpiration, and shoot biomass in arabidopsis  <cit> . this indicates that aquaporins can contribute to the establishment of high photosynthetic rates on the middle of the leaf blade. myb transcription factors are related to leaf development in tobacco  <cit>  and to leaf and shoot architecture in tomato  <cit> . in addition, the myb-related protein zm <dig> regulates negatively genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit>  and also epidermal cell development  <cit> .

a protein that has strong similarity to the c-terminal region of the mid domain of the argonaute  protein mel <dig>  was also present at the m. mel <dig> is associated with small rna-directed regulatory pathways  <cit>  and some studies have already indicated the importance of small rnas on abiotic stress response . even though it is not clear how many ago genes there are in sugarcane genome, we were able to identify all the rice ago genes in four groups of orthologues  and in each of them there is at least one sugarcane representative. however, the protein sp803280_c113083_g <dig> is not present in any of these groups of orthologous genes and may represent a novelty in sugarcane.

developmental studies indicate the importance of ago on rice sporogenesis  <cit> , arabidopsis female gamete formation  <cit> , leaf, shoot and apical meristem development , stomata development  <cit> , control of meiosis and dna repair  <cit>  and shoot meristem initiation in rice  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the role of small rnas on leaf development is well studied  <cit>  and there is also evidence of the importance of mirna in on leaf development of other species such as celery  <cit>  and potato  <cit> . although there is no direct evidence, our study in sugarcane and the work from li et al.  <cit>  in maize suggest that mirnas must play an important role on leaf development of grasses, but it is still a topic to be explored.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report evaluating sugarcane leaf segments representing different developmental stages and it has proven to be a valuable tool for investigating the genes that might be regulators of c <dig> syndrome. in our study we describe detailed physiological and biochemical analyses among leaf segments. we also have made use of the next generation sequencing technology rna-seq to identify molecular differences along the leaf blade of sugarcane. in addition, we compared our data with previous work recently published for maize  <cit> . this analysis revealed that leaf development differs significantly between sugarcane and maize based on their transcriptional profile. although this comparison was limited in some aspects, it indicates large differences between these two species pointed out the importance of studying other crops in order to acquire substantial novel knowledge to enable improvement of the photosynthetic capacity followed by increase in productivity.
