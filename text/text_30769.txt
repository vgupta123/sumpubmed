BACKGROUND
association genetics via ld mapping is an emerging field of genetic mapping that has the potential to reach resolution to the level of individual genes  underlying quantitative traits. a single nucleotide polymorphism  is a unique nucleotide base difference between two dna sequences. in theory, snp variations could involve four different nucleotides at a particular site, but actually only two of these four possibilities are mostly observed. thus, in practice, snps are biallelic markers, so the information content on a single snp is limited compared to the polyallelic ssr markers  <cit> . this disadvantage is overcome by the relatively larger abundance and stability of snp loci compared to ssr loci. for instance, the usual frequency of snps reported for plant genomes is about  <dig> snp every 100– <dig> bp  <cit> . the abundance, ubiquity and interspersed nature of snps together with the potential of automatic high-throughput analysis make them ideal candidates as molecular markers for construction of high-density genetic maps, qtl fine mapping, marker-assisted plant breeding and genetic association studies  <cit> . in addition, snps located in known genes provide a fast alternative to analyze the fate of agronomically important alleles in breeding populations, thus providing functional markers.

several methodologies have been used to identify dna variants  <cit> , but usually snps discovery is achieved by electronic screening of comprehensive est collections and re-sequencing of selected candidate regions from multiple or representative individuals of a target population  <cit> . massive methods like high-density oligonucleotide probe arrays have recently emerged to identify single feature polymorphisms  as attractive alternatives to snps  <cit> . in the last years, a number of large-scale snp discovery projects have been carried out in crop plants to apply association analysis to crop genetic improvement  <cit> . association analysis includes the estimation of nucleotide diversity, the assessment of linkage disequilibrium structure  and/or the correlation between polymorphisms and the evaluation of selection processes. association studies based on ld come from well-studied model species such as arabidopsis thaliana, maize, rice and barley  <cit>  as well as woody plants  <cit> , ryegrass  <cit>  and economically important crops such as wheat, soybean, sorghum and potato  <cit> . the rationale behind this approach is that nucleotide diversity not only reflects the history of selection, migration, recombination and mating systems of a given organism, but also provides information on the source of most of the phenotypic variation  <cit> . systematic searches of associations between individual snps, or snp haplotypes and phenotypes of interest within a suitable population would render the identification of causative variants , leading to "gene-assisted-selection", where advantageous genotypes could be selected based on their dna sequence reducing the costs of phenotypic testing.

analyses of genetic diversity in sunflower  were based, until very recently, solely on traditional techniques such as allozymes  <cit>  and ssrs  <cit> . trait mapping by allele association requires a high-density map, which could be obtained by the addition of snps to the ssr genetic maps already generated  <cit> . to date, the only data available on sunflower nucleotide diversity comes from the study of  <dig> genomic loci in  <dig> wild populations and exotic germplasm accessions  <cit>  and of  <dig> rflp loci in  <dig> inbred lines  <cit> . however, further investigation of the nature, frequency and distribution of sequence variation is still needed to better understand the range of diversity and the origin of the genetic changes associated with domestication and agronomic improvement. indeed, the choice of germplasm is crucial for the discovery of useful alleles, and a genotypically diverse set of germplasm must be chosen to achieve this goal. furthermore, the inclusion of candidate regions putatively related to biotic or abiotic stresses might help zeroing in on candidate tagged snps to evaluate allele association in sunflower germplasm.

here, we present a survey of nucleotide diversity at  <dig> loci related to biotic and abiotic stresses from  <dig> sunflower public elite inbred lines that are well recognized breeding materials representing the species diversity  <cit> . the aims of this study were to:  determine the frequency and the nature of the snps and indels in current breeding populations,  examine the effects of population structure on ld assessment,  compare the resulting nucleotide diversity and ld estimates to those previously reported for wild and cultivated sunflower.

RESULTS
snps frequency and nucleotide diversity
a total of  <dig> candidate regions related to biotic and abiotic stresses were selected for snp identification and nucleotide diversity analyses . single pcr products of the expected sizes were detected for  <dig> regions  and  <dig> of them  yielded high-quality sequence data. the features and polymorphism indices of the  <dig> candidate genes used for subsequent analyses are shown in table  <dig> . the  <dig> genomic loci were amplified in  <dig> genotypes representative of cultivated sunflower germplasm, comprising  <dig>  bp of aligned sequence per individual. each gene alignment ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp including indels. further inspection of table  <dig> reveals the occurrence of at least  <dig> snp in  <dig> out of  <dig> genes evaluated, with a total of  <dig> nucleotide changes identified among all genes and individuals analyzed. thus, an average of  <dig> snp every  <dig> bp  and a mean number of  <dig>  snps per region were detected. as expected, occurrence of synonymous substitutions  was fourfold larger than non-synonymous snps  and  <dig> % of transitions were found. the number of snps varied also between coding and non-coding regions:  <dig> snps were found in  <dig>  bp of coding regions whereas  <dig> snps were detected in  <dig>  bp of intergenic or intragenic non-coding sequences: hence, the snp frequency was  <dig> snp/ <dig> bp in coding regions and  <dig> snp/ <dig> bp in non-coding regions. these results suggest that coding regions are more conserved  than non-coding regions, most probably due to purifying selection. on the other hand, the number of indels varied across genes from  <dig> to  <dig>  counting  <dig> indel polymorphisms in the complete data set. the frequency found for indels was 1/ <dig>  bp reaching an average of  <dig>  indels per region analyzed. indel sizes were highly variable, ranging from a single nucleotide to  <dig> bp in cam . in some instances, the precise number of insertion and/or deletion events giving rise to each indel block was difficult to establish, especially in those regions where variable numbers of base pairs were added or deleted in different individuals in the same block. interestingly,  <dig> indels were found in coding regions:  <dig> in the madsb-tf <dig>  and  <dig> in gadph . all indels were excluded from subsequent analyses except for both haplotype and haplotype diversity analyses in go, lzp, glp and gpx candidate regions .

summarizing, moderate levels of dna polymorphism were found . genetic variation at the nucleotide level was estimated from mean nucleotide diversity  and from the number of segregating sites . average silent-site diversity  and synonymous-site diversity  were higher than non-synonymous changes . in 26/ <dig> loci examined, πnonsyn was either  <dig> or lower than πsyn, suggesting that the diversity of these regions is governed by purifying selection. however, the go and the rl <dig> regions showed πnonsyn higher than πsyn. in go πnonsyn was  <dig> , while πsyn was 0; a single nucleotide substitution in the rha <dig> inbred line, is responsible for this difference. in rl <dig> the non-synonymous substitutions are caused by  <dig> singletons present in ha <dig> and by a parsimony informative site which separates ha <dig>  ha <dig>  ha <dig>  klm <dig>  pac <dig>  rha <dig> and rha <dig> from the remaining inbred lines. this substitution is a c/a transversion in the 2nd codon position and causes the change from a proline to a glutamine . whether this site is essential for the protein to be functional still remains to be determined. despite the fact that snp frequency was higher in non-coding than in coding regions, the average nucleotide polymorphism and nucleotide diversity of non-coding regions  was only slightly higher, although non-significant, than diversity estimates in coding regions .

the number of haplotypes per locus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> among the  <dig> inbred lines and average haplotype diversity was  <dig> . although lzp, glp and gpx sequences did not display any snp polymorphism, the indels exhibited in these candidate genes were enough to determine distinct haplotypes, with haplotype diversity values of  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  .

in terms of allele frequency distribution, even though tajima's d was not significantly different from  <dig> in 27/ <dig> regions , it was significantly positive in ant . positive tajima's d value indicates a deficit of low frequency alleles relative to neutral expectations in a randomly mating population of constant size. in this context, positive d values could be the consequence of population bottlenecks, population subdivision or balancing selection as would be expected in breeding populations.

to avoid the distortions introduced by gene sampling, the estimates of diversity were recalculated for the  <dig> inbred lines included in this work and for the primitive and improved accessions  chosen by liu and burke  <cit>  using only the subset of genes in common for both studies . the θw average values were  <dig>  for the  <dig> inbred lines,  <dig>  for the p&i cultivated group and  <dig>  for the pooled accessions. in addition, the πt values were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. therefore, the nucleotide diversity estimates  for the  <dig> inbred lines analyzed in this work remained the same regardless of the loci being surveyed.

the  <dig> regions  in common with liu and burke report were re-analyzed in the inbred lines , the improved and primitive cultivated accessions surveyed by liu and burke   <cit>  and the complete set of accessions pooled together . the diversity estimates  displayed the same pattern independently the loci surveyed.

linkage disequilibrium 
the presence of population structure can lead to spurious results and must be considered in the statistical analysis  <cit> . therefore, as a preliminary step to the assessment of ld, population structure was analyzed using the model-based approach reported by pritchard et al.  <cit> , employing  <dig> non-linked snp loci derived from the  <dig> genes shared between the  <dig> inbred lines studied in this work and the  <dig> wild and cultivated individuals previously reported by liu and burke  <cit> . this test was useful to prevent spurious associations that arise for reasons other than physical proximity and to assess the real extent of ld. the highest log likelihood scores were obtained when the number of populations was set to five. each individual's inferred ancestry to the five model-based populations is presented in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> elite accessions examined here are mainly composed by the contribution of two gene pools , with most of their inferred ancestries being higher than 80%. these two gene pools are also the main constituents, but in a different proportion, of the cultivated accessions analyzed by liu and burke  <cit> . as expected, the wild accessions have a more diverse ancestry, with contributions from all five model-based populations identified. on the basis of population structure analysis, two groups can be defined within the  <dig> inbred lines studied in this work. the first group  is composed by ha <dig>  ha <dig>  ha <dig>  ha <dig>  har <dig>  har <dig>  klm <dig>  pac <dig>  rha <dig>  ha <dig>  rha <dig> and rha <dig> ; the second group  includes ha <dig>  ha <dig>  ha <dig>  ha <dig>  har <dig>  rha <dig> and v <dig> inbred lines . according to the method's assumptions, these two groups are characterized by different sets of allele frequencies. for this reason, pairwise estimates of ld  were calculated for:  the entire set of inbred lines , and  the subset of inbred lines from g <dig> . the g <dig> subset was not included in this analysis because of its small number of individuals. figure  <dig> displays the scatter plots of r <dig> versus the physical distance between all pairs of snp alleles within a gene, pooled for the  <dig> polymorphic regions included in this work. since all regions are < <dig> kbp long this analysis reveals disequilibrium patterns at short distance. for the entire set of genotypes, the logarithmic trend line declines very slowly, reaching a value of  <dig>  at  <dig> bp . conversely, when the ld plot includes only the genotypes belonging to g <dig> group, the logarithmic trend decays more rapidly and the value is  <dig>  for the same distance . as expected, there is clearly a bias towards higher levels of ld when the population structure in the sample is not factored into the analysis. interlocus analyses revealed no ld between loci .

discussion
snps frequency and nucleotide diversity
candidate genes were selected from ssh-est collection, literature and in silico analysis attending to their putative role in biotic and/or abiotic stresses, while other randomly selected regions were included as controls. they were properly sequenced in  <dig> very well known inbred lines used in breeding programs and different patterns of polymorphisms were obtained. the snp frequency detected in our set of elite accessions was  <dig> snp/ <dig> bp: whereas it is quite comparable to the frequency obtained by ching et al. for maize inbred lines   <cit> , it is higher than the frequency reported by tenaillon et al.  also for maize  <cit> . nevertheless, the discrepancy between maize studies could be caused by differences in gene sampling. moreover, the abundance of snps that we found in sunflower is comparable to the one described in a pinus taeda report, which exhibited  <dig> snp/ <dig> bp  <cit> . on the other hand, other agronomically important crops like sorghum   <cit> , soybean   <cit>  and rice   <cit>  presented a lower snp frequency than the sunflower inbred lines surveyed in this work.

snp occurrence in sunflower as well as nucleotide diversity values were reported recently by liu and burke for  <dig> primitive and improved accessions  and by kolkman et al. for  <dig> inbred lines   <cit> . the differences among these values and the estimates described in this work might be explained by:  the expected differences in the genetic divergence of the materials analyzed ,  the different sources of variation being considered  and  the differences in quantity and/or selection criteria of the genomic regions sequenced. concerning the last statement,  <dig> out of  <dig> candidate genes selected in this work were uncharacterized novel regions including putative stress related proteins as well as randomly selected loci, which represent a good collection of the genome-wide expected pattern of snps. to determine whether the effect of interlocus variance  may distort the nucleotide diversity estimates , we re-analyzed the sequence data of the  <dig> shared genes between the  <dig> inbred lines surveyed in this report and the p&i accessions analyzed by liu and burke  <cit> . the mean θw in the inbred lines  still remained lower and the mean πt  remained higher than the re-calculated estimates for the p&i individuals  . these results confirm the pattern previously observed for the entire set of genes formerly analyzed in the  <dig> inbred lines. in addition, the θw and πt from the  <dig> genes for the pooled accessions were higher than both, the  <dig> inbred lines and p&i individual estimates. consequently, these discrepancies are not caused by gene sampling and therefore, they might reflect genuine differences in the levels of polymorphism for different groups of individuals. while the θw is based on the number of segregating sites and is influenced by the presence of rare alleles, the πt is a measure of the pairwise differences between two sequences. a deficiency of rare alleles is expected under the pronounced bottlenecks that lead to the origin of inbred lines and the increased in pairwise differences can result from the divergent nature of the elite materials selected for this study. the analyses of the pooled data confirmed those differences between the sources employed in both works, thus, weighting not only the presence of rare alleles in p&i accessions, but also the divergent nature of elite inbred lines. wild sunflowers showed snp occurrence  and nucleotide diversity values   <cit>  higher than the estimates obtained for the  <dig> elite inbred lines, which is in agreement with our expectations because of the history of artificial selection, recombination and improvement of the last ones.

regarding synonymous and non-synonymous changes, in the  <dig> inbred lines average silent-site diversity  and synonymous-site diversity  were higher than mean non-synonymous changes , however,  <dig> loci showed higher πnonsyn than πsyn . particularly in rl <dig>  one non-synonymous substitution is a parsimony informative site that changes the protein sequence at that codon position. nevertheless, this kind of changes are frequently seen on inbred lines that were subjected to artificial selection, for instance, missense changes were observed in invariant sites of hd proteins of rice cultivars as a probable consequence of artificial selection during the domestication process  <cit> .

concerning the evaluation of selection, most of the genes  showed tajima's d values which were not significantly different from  <dig>  while one region showed a significantly positive tajima's d . as mentioned before, positive d values could be the consequence of population bottlenecks, population subdivision or balancing selection. these factors are likely to be operational in sunflower elite lines. the population bottleneck caused by inbreeding may change the rate of allelic frequency and the conditions for a stable polymorphism in the entire data set. hence, the data presented above do no adjust to this hypothesis. in contrast, selection is the factor that might probably affect d values in only one gene. anyway, neither population bottlenecks nor selection can be proved without a more comprehensive and genome-wide study in sunflower.

linkage disequilibrium assessment
linkage equilibrium and ld are population genetics terms used to describe the likelihood of co-occurrence of alleles at different loci in a population. generally, linkage refers to the correlated inheritance of loci through physical connection on a chromosome  <cit> . population subdivision and admixture increase ld, but their effects depend on the number of populations, the rate of exchange between populations and the recombination rate  <cit> . association analysis based on ld has been employed recently in plants, with initial resistance due in large part to the confounding effects of population structure and the general lack of knowledge regarding the structure of ld in many plant species  <cit> . the complex breeding history of sunflower inbred lines and the consequent stratification of the germplasm may lead to an overestimation of the extent of ld, therefore extending non-random correlations to physically un-linked loci and thus making association mapping to fail. inclusion of population structure in association models is critical for meaningful analysis  <cit> . the model-based clustering method of pritchard  <cit>  showed that inbred lines examined in this work were further sub-structured into two groups: g <dig> and g <dig> . ld decay was slightly slower for the entire genotype set than for the g <dig> group . therefore, the line through the g <dig> data  is in concordance with the ld analysis showed by kolkman et al.  <cit> . despite the short-range ld that we were able to asses, the trend line for the g <dig> reaches a value of  <dig>  at  <dig> bp, in agreement with the values obtained by kolkman et al.  <cit> . the patterns of pairwise ld differed greatly between the wild sunflowers and cultivated samples analyzed here: in the former group, the strong linkage disequilibrium was evidenced within distances < <dig> bp  <cit> , whereas in the second group it was noticeable at least up to  <dig> bp . the same pattern was observed in both the p&i cultivated samples analyzed by liu and burke  <cit>  and in the set of inbred lines analyzed by kolkman et al.  <cit> . patterns of ld in other organisms are quite variable. for maize inbred lines  <cit>  non-significant decay was observed in ld  within the  <dig> bp analyzed, as it was found in sunflower inbred lines. however, assessments in chromosome  <dig> of maize landraces and inbred lines showed ld decay within 200– <dig> bp  <cit> . in addition, snps-ld in other maize loci and individuals evidenced a negligible level of ld  at  <dig> bp of distance  <cit>  reflecting the rapid decay of ld in out-crossing species. solanum tuberosum, despite being an out-crossing species, showed intermediate ld values   <cit>  probably as a consequence of its vegetative propagation system. on the other hand, selfing species showed a larger extent of ld: > <dig> kbp in soybean  <cit> , > <dig> kbp in arabidopsis  <cit>  and ~ <dig> kbp in rice  <cit> . similarly, ld in sorghum , apparently dissipates within  <dig> kbp  <cit> . these last organisms seem to have ld patterns more comparable to the results presented in this work for cultivated sunflower.

CONCLUSIONS
this study contributes to previously reported analyses of nucleotide diversity and linkage disequilibrium in sunflower  <cit> . knowledge about genetic relationships between breeding materials could be an invaluable aid in crop improvement strategies. analysis of genetic diversity in germplasm collections can facilitate reliable classification of accessions and identification of core accessions subsets with possible utility for specific breeding purposes. sunflower inbred lines showed a frequency of  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp, with nucleotide diversity estimates of θw =  <dig>  and πt =  <dig> . as expected, these moderate levels of diversity were lower than diversity estimates found in wild accessions of sunflower  <cit> . the population structure analysis identified the subset of inbred lines that belong to a unique gene pool , and helped us to assess the extent of ld without spurious associations. the extent of ld from the g <dig> group adjusted more accurately with previously reports of ld in cultivated sunflower  <cit>  and the trend line predicted a decay of ld  within the  <dig> kbp. the data presented in this work could facilitate association mapping in sunflower with lower marker densities than those usually reported in the literature for other plant species, at least at a rough scale.
