BACKGROUND
more than  <dig> years ago, gilbert predicted the existence of protein variants due to the alternative use of exon-intron borders in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . this prediction has been continually confirmed as a common feature of many species, including humans. recent estimations, based on high-throughput sequencing, suggest that 90-95% of multiple-exon human genes undergo alternative splicing   <cit> , producing an average of six distinct transcripts from each gene  <cit> . this phenomenon enormously impacts the repertoire of proteins, since 80% of as events occur within the coding region  <cit> , thus interfering in the functional aspects of the cells.

as regulates important processes, such as embryonic development, cellular differentiation and apoptosis, by the generation of different protein isoforms among distinct tissues, developmental stages and pathological conditions  <cit> . alterations of the splicing process, such as the loss of expression balance between variants and aberrant splicing, can lead to the deregulation of crucial cellular processes and are consequently associated with a large spectrum of human diseases  <cit> , including cancer  <cit> .

the development of methodologies to explore transcriptome diversity resulting from as has been shown to be a potent tool, not only for improving the biological basis of cancer but also for searching for more precise molecular markers for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic purposes  <cit> . different strategies for large-scale as variant exploration have been used with different goals. sequence and microarray-based approaches have been used for defining the as repertoire of human cells. the former includes several computational analyses concerning genomic and transcriptome alignments of human ests  and mrna databases  <cit>  and cross-species alignment from closely related organisms  <cit> ; the latter includes genomic and exon-intron junction microarray platforms  <cit> . both approaches have contributed to the investigation of the expression pattern of as variants and also facilitated the identification of novel as variants. nonetheless, both approaches are impaired in detecting low-abundance as transcripts. in this sense, as-enriched cdna libraries is one of the most interesting approaches because it combines the convenience of cdna direct sequencing with the advantage of detecting low-abundance transcript variants. the methodology is based on one enrichment step, consisting of the trapping of heteroduplex molecules formed by the hybridization of two distinct as variants from the same gene  <cit> . the heteroduplex can be captured by molecules that recognize the heteroduplex structure  <cit> , generating a vast number of as events without previous knowledge of them. in this study, to explore as variants associated with breast tumor cells, we established a powerful approach that enabled the direct exploration of an as repertoire by combining the use of trapping heteroduplex and rna amplification. to favor the trapping of splicing variants associated with breast tumor cells that over-expresses the erbb <dig>  oncogene, a human breast cell line  and a pool of  <dig> erbb <dig> over-expressing breast tumor samples were used. two as-enriched libraries were constructed, generating a set of  <dig>  partial cdna sequences, named here as alternative splicing sequence-enriched tags , as suggested by watahiki and collaborators  <cit> . a subset with  <dig> assets representing distinct multiple exon sequences was explored in this analysis and reported  <dig> different as events. a high rate of validation by rt-pcr  was obtained, and  <dig> novel as events were identified. moreover, the balance in the expression level of the as variants from  <dig> genes was influenced by erbb2-mediated expression.

the approach presented here certainly will contribute to the identification of the as repertoire of cancer cells, especially as it is potentially applicable to any cell type from any tumor tissue, since a small amount of total rna is required with no previous cdna library construction. furthermore, it is completely suitable for using with next-generation sequencers, substantially increasing its potential in deciphering the as diversity in cancer cell transcriptome.

RESULTS
alternative splicing libraries
two distinct as libraries were constructed  using  <dig> µg of total rna as the starting material. library  <dig>  was prepared from the human breast cell line c <dig> , which over-expresses the oncogene erbb <dig>  and library  <dig>  was prepared from a pool of  <dig> invasive breast carcinoma samples that stained positively for erbb <dig> according to immunohistochemistry analysis .

age: age of diagnosis; tnm: classification according to tnm ; ln: involvement of sentinel lymph nodes; grade: grades i, ii and iii according to sbr; molecular markers: er – estrogen receptor; pr – progesterone receptor; p <dig> – protein tp53; and erbb <dig> – protein erbb <dig> 

the strategy for as library construction was based on the methodology described by watahiki and collaborators  <cit>  with some modifications. one significant difference was the use of total rna instead of parental full-length cdna libraries, which simplifies the process and decreases costs. another important adaptation was the inclusion of a rna amplification procedure based on t <dig> rna polymerase and template switch oligo   <cit> , which allows the use of small quantities of rna . the amplified rna was converted into double-stranded cdna  , which was then submitted to denaturation and renaturation steps, promoting the formation of heteroduplex dna molecules by the hybridization of complementary regions from two distinct splicing variants from the same gene . the remaining single-stranded molecules or overhanging regions were removed with exonuclease vii treatment , whereas the double-stranded cdna molecules were cleaved with the dpnii restriction enzyme . this step resulted in double-stranded fragments, constituting homo- and heteroduplex molecules with cohesive ends to bind adaptors. the enrichment of the heteroduplex molecules occurred through the trapping of single-stranded loops by the annealing of random 25-mer biotinilated oligonucleotides captured by streptavidin magnetic particles . complementary overhanging adaptors were then specifically ligated to the cohesive ends of the heteroduplex molecules , generating a recognition site for primer annealing and consequently allowing for pcr amplification , cloning and sequencing.

a total of  <dig>  high quality sequences  were generated from both libraries. sequences from each library were clustered using the cap <dig> program  <cit> , resulting in  <dig> consensus sequences for library lib_ <dig>  and  <dig> consensus sequences for library lib_ <dig>  . the number of consensus sequences obtained revealed, as expected, a high redundancy within the libraries , since no normalization procedure was implemented in our approach.

all consensus sequences were then aligned to the human genome  using blast  <cit>  and sim <dig>  <cit> , where only the best hit was considered. based on criteria for identity  and coverage ,  <dig> consensus sequences were aligned on the human genome,  <dig> and  <dig> of them reporting multiple and one-exon sequences, respectively . the consensuses were termed assets, as previously proposed  <cit> .

furthermore, to check whether our library construction approach enables full-length representation, including the 5’ end of transcripts, we verified the relative position of the assets throughout the length of full-lengths . the analysis resulted in a similar representation of 3’ and 5’ ends with a slightly higher concentration of assets in the central region, indicating that no bias were introduced towards higher representation of full transcript 3’ ends. additionally, the fact that the average size of mrnas  represented by assets in our libraries was of  <dig>  nt, similar to the average size of all mrna sequences from refseq database  suggested no bias in representation of 5’ end from short transcripts .

detection of alternative splicing events
no distinct splicing variants were observed among the sequences belonging to the same consensuses that would be indicative of putative as events. therefore, we searched for as events through comparisons between assets and full-length or partial cdna sequences available in public databases.

first, assets were clustered with ests from dbest , mrnas  and refseqs  downloaded from ucsc  . this step resulted in  <dig> clusters, where  <dig> contained at least one refseq sequence. sixteen clusters contained sequences from both libraries , revealing an overlap of approximately 10%.

the  <dig> clusters containing assets with multiple exons were scanned for as events through pairwise comparisons of exon/intron boundaries between the asset and the reference sequences of each cluster. as events were searched within the region delimited by the two outermost overlapping regions of each asset related cluster. for each asset, the corresponding gene and the number and type of related alternative splicing events were annotated.

all  <dig> multiple exon assets were considered known transcripts since they were represented by sequences at public databases. moreover, for  <dig> out of  <dig> assets , an alternatively spliced transcript was described in the public databases. for these  <dig> assets,  <dig> as events were detected, including intron retention , exon skipping , alternative splice site 3’  and alternative splice site 5’ . the remaining  <dig> assets, to which no as event has been reported, may result from novel as events not yet reported in public databases . the intronless assets were not used for the as search, since it is not possible to identify the direction of transcripts in the absence of splice sites. nonetheless, it is interesting to note that  <dig> out of  <dig> intronless sequences  aligned to regions involved in as, according to public databases. this can be considered an indirect sign that these assets are prone as transcripts.

*assets selected for rt-pcr validation

gene ontology annotation
for exploring the functional aspects of the genes that harbor as, the  <dig> assets were classified within the biological process categories. using bingo tools  <cit> ,  <dig> categories revealed a statistically significant enrichment of genes  and are represented in a hierarchical form in figure  <dig>  the most significantly enriched category was translation elongation, due to a great number of ribosomal proteins detected in our data.

validation of assets and heteroduplexes
eighteen assets were randomly selected for rt-pcr validation, including  <dig> and  <dig> assets exclusively from lib_ <dig> and lib_ <dig>  respectively and  <dig> assets that were detected in both libraries. the validation process was performed in two steps: i. asset validation - to confirm the presence of the asset in the same rna used for library construction and ii. heteroduplex validation - to search for alternatively spliced transcripts that could have participated in the heteroduplex formation . by using a pair of primers that aligned at the extremities of the asset sequence, all but one asset was validated . the  <dig> assets identified by both libraries were validated in both templates. secondly, for  <dig>  out of the  <dig> validated assets , an additional as variant was identified that could have participated in the heteroduplex formation. two out of  <dig> as variants that were transcribed from the genes ptpla and trip <dig>  which were not described in public databases, are novel splicing variants. the lack of heteroduplex validation for the other  <dig> genes was probably due to a differential expression balance between splicing variants that precluded the amplification of one variant in favor of the most abundant one. the support for this assumption is that for  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes, an as variant that could have participated in the heteroduplex formation was available in databases. for verifying whether the low level of overlap between both libraries was due to the low coverage in terms of the number of sequences generated for each library or due to the specific as pattern of each rna source used, we tested if the  <dig> assets validated in cdna from the corresponding library were also expressed in the cdna from the other library. four assets from the  <dig> identified by lib_ <dig> were successfully amplified using the cdna from the pool of the tumor samples . all  <dig> assets from lib_ <dig> were successfully amplified using the cdna from c <dig>  , totaling  <dig> % cross-validation . the validation results are summarized in table  <dig>

library origin: library where the asset was captured from; selected assets: number of randomly selected assets; asset validation: to confirm the presence of the asset in the same rna used for library construction; heteroduplex validation: amplification of alternatively spliced transcripts that could have participated in the heteroduplex formation; and cross-validation: amplification of assets specifically captured from one library using the cdna template from the other library.

novel alternative splicing: characterization of the putative isoforms
the  <dig> novel as variants were characterized regarding the putative corresponding protein isoform. the ptpla gene  codes for the member a of the protein tyrosine phosphatase-like family that contains proline instead of catalytic arginine. this gene contains  <dig> exons, and the as variant detected in our study is due to the use of an alternative 5’ splice site of intron  <dig> that elongates exon  <dig> by  <dig> nt . all protein functional domains found for ptpla were also present in the novel as detected. however, in the novel as variant, a premature stop codon was created  <dig> nt upstream of the exon 5/exon  <dig> junction, probably leading to regulation by non-sense mediated decay   <cit> .

the trip <dig> gene  is a thyroid hormone receptor interactor  <dig> that contains  <dig> exons. the novel alternatively spliced transcript reports retention of the last intron . the protein coded by the trip <dig> gene localizes to focal adhesion sites and along actin stress fibers. the novel as variant identified also inserts a premature stop codon in the putative coding protein, without interfering with any protein functional domain.

evaluation of as variant regulation by erbb2-mediated expression
finally, we investigated the putative influence of erbb2-mediated expression on the regulation of as variants for  <dig> assets validated using gapdh as a normalization factor, by comparing the expression level of the assets in the c <dig>  cell line in relation to the erbb <dig> basal expressed counterpart – the normal breast cell line  through capillary microfluidic electrophoresis  that accurately assesses the size and quantity of each amplification product  <cit> .

for the  <dig> validated assets, the relative expression levels were analyzed showing a slight influence of erbb <dig> over-expression in all assets  .

for the  <dig> assets presenting an additional as variant, the putative influence of erbb <dig> over-expression in the relative expression balance of the pairs of distinct splicing variants  was evaluated in both cell lines. we first calculated the expression ratio from asset against the variant to each cdna template and then compared the expression ratio between the c <dig>  against hb4a cell lines. for  <dig> out of  <dig> genes, a decrease in the expression balance of the asset and additional as variants was identified between the tumor and normal cell lines . in more detail, the assets corresponding to sfrs <dig>  and flna  genes were stably expressed between cell lines, while the additional as variants were more expressed in the c <dig>  compared to hb4a cell line  leading to a decrease of  <dig>   and  <dig>   in the expression balance between the splice variants . the asset of the trip <dig> gene  was more expressed in the hb4a than in the c <dig>  , whereas the additional as variant presented no expression difference. these results suggested that erbb2-mediated expression differently modulates the alternative splice variants of the genes sfrs <dig>  flna and trip <dig>  for the other  <dig> genes , no difference in the expression balance of the as variants between the cell lines was observed .

to confirm the alteration in the relative expression balance of as variants mediated by erbb <dig> expression, a different approach based on probe-specific ligation and pcr amplification was applied  <cit> . in this strategy,  <dig> pairs of probes were designed for each gene, specifically targeting the variants of interest . the expression balance difference was confirmed for all  <dig> genes  visualized on the acrylamide gel .

discussion
the diversity of the human transcriptional repertoire caused by as has been extensively investigated  <cit> , and it is agreed that its regulation is an important mechanism for physiological and pathological aspects of cells. moreover, as is a major contributor to protein diversity, which, in part, explains the high complexity of mammals compared to much simpler organisms containing a similar numbers of genes  <cit> .

different approaches have been used to explore the variability caused by this phenomenon, and one of the most promising strategies is the use of as enriched cdna libraries  <cit> . this strategy does not require previous knowledge of the variants and permits an as transcriptome-wide analysis.

deciphering of the human transcriptional repertoire related to as variability is an enormous contribution in the comprehension of cancer and in the identification of more precise molecular markers in cancer.

here we described an as enriched cdna library method by combining the use of trapping heteroduplex and rna amplification procedures. the methodology was initially proposed by watahiki and collaborators  <cit>  and was applied in this study with some modifications to favor its application in clinically-oriented cancer studies, in which the availability of total rna recovered from tumor tissues is normally restrictive. moreover, the methodology established in this study is potentially applicable to rna purified from a homogenous tumor cell population captured from a complex tissue by laser, which produces transcriptional data more correlated with the tumor cell.

our strategy showed, in general, minimal artifacts in the identification of assets, since our validation rate by rt-pcr was significantly high . moreover, the fact that the great majority of the as events found in our as enriched libraries were present in public databases and that 100% of them harbor conserved splice sites strengths the assumption that we have established a robust methodology for identifying as in a transcriptome-wide format.

the fact that we could confirm by rt-pcr novel alternatively spliced transcripts for  <dig> genes to which no as variant was present in public databases is further support that among the assets with no confirmation of as events, a high frequency of prone additional as variants, which could participate in heteroduplex formation, is expected. the absence of amplification during the validation process of additional as transcripts for two thirds of the selected genes suggests a significant difference in the expression level of both variants with consequent competition for the same pair of primers in the pcr reaction, avoiding the amplification of low-abundance as transcripts.

the relatively high redundancy levels encountered in both libraries  were somewhat expected. this number is similar to the redundancy reported by thill and collaborators  <cit> . in technical terms, this problem can be bypassed by decreasing the number of pcr cycles in the library construction, which is relatively easy to control.

another potential problem was that no additional alternatively spliced transcripts were identified in sequence data provided by enriched cdna libraries alone. this can be indicative of a problem caused by using non-phosphorylated adaptors. in this situation, only one strand  of these adaptors was ligated to the 5’ end of the dpnii digested molecules that contains a phosphate residue; the other strand  was not ligated and, as a consequence, was disconnected from the cdna molecules at the denaturation step of pcr and was consequently unable to be cloned and sequenced. usually this region is re-synthesized by polymerase at the first cycle of the pcr reaction through annealing of complementary regions of cdna molecules, a process known as polymerase fill-in, also seen in some cdna library approaches  <cit> . however, in our case where the strands of cdna molecules are from distinct alternatively spliced transcripts, the fill-in process is probably inefficient due to non-perfect annealing. to avoid this problem, the use of phosphorylated adaptors is a simple solution that would favor the representation of both alternatively spliced transcripts that formed the heteroduplex structure.

erbb <dig>  or her-2/neu, is an oncogene that is over-expressed in 20-30% of human breast carcinomas and is associated with poor prognosis, independent of the lymph node status  <cit> . this marker is also associated with chemo resistance to a range of anticancer drugs and a positive response to herceptin  <cit> . despite this oncogene being most extensively investigated in clinical and basic oncology, the erbb2-mediated mechanism involved in the transformation and progression of breast tumors has not yet been totally elucidated.

in this study, we proposed to identify alternatively spliced transcripts associated with breast tumors that are under erbb <dig> influence by constructing  <dig> as-enriched cdna libraries using rna sources representative of erbb <dig> over-expression: the human breast cell line c <dig>  that was previously transfected with  <dig> copies of full-length erbb <dig> <cit>  and a pool of  <dig> breast carcinoma samples, which demonstrate strong positivity in erbb <dig> immunostaining in tumor cell membranes  <cit> .

for testing if the expression of assets was regulated by erbb2-mediated expression, we evaluated the assets validated by rt-pcr in both cell lines, hb4a and c <dig> , the former with basal levels and the latter with over-expression of erbb <dig> mrna  <cit> . both cell lines have been considered a model for the investigation of erbb2-mediated expression, since the only difference between them is the insertion of  <dig> copies of full-length erbb <dig> in the c <dig>  cell line  <cit> . for the assets in which we could identify an additional as transcript by rt-pcr, 50% of them  seemed to be influenced by erbb2-mediated expression, since differences in the relative expression balance between both cell lines were observed.

although the expression assessment of  <dig> or more as variants is a problematic issue concerning accurate quantification the results presented here were confirmed by an alternative methodology, which increased the robustness of the data.

the microfluidic capillary electrophoresis-based strategy relies on amplification of both variants in the same reaction and could introduce bias due to amplification competition between variants. however, this would be expected to equally influence all reactions, independent of the template used. the alternative strategy relies on the specific binding of probes under highly stringent conditions, enabling the evaluation of each variant separately, with high accuracy and is consequently very promising for as expression assessment. the different expression balance between both cell lines for  <dig> genes confirmed by  <dig> different approaches suggests that these genes transcribe as variants, whose expression is differently influenced by erbb <dig> 

flna is a member of the actin-binding protein family that organizes actin filaments and is involved in numerous cellular processes, especially development. many studies have reported the involvement of this protein in carcinogenesis. using melanoma cell lines lacking or expressing flna, fiori and collaborators  <cit>  have shown that this protein is an important regulator of egfr members  that ensure efficient ligand-mediated activation of these receptors and, consequently, intracellular trafficking and degradation.

sfrs <dig> is a rna-binding protein from the arginine/serine-rich family that acts as a splicing factor regulating constitutive splicing and also modulating the selection of alternative splice sites. it has been suggested that this protein acts downstream of the erbb <dig> pathway, since phosphorylation of sfrs <dig> was detected in erbb2-over expressing breast and ovarian cancer cells and was reduced by monoclonal antibody herceptin treatment. moreover, a putative role for sfrs <dig> in cell migration was suggested, since migration was significantly retarded following the depletion of sfrs <dig> transcripts in ovarian cancer cell lines  <cit> .

trip <dig> is a thyroid hormone receptor interactor that localizes to focal adhesion sites and along actin stress fibers  <cit> . this protein enhances lysophosphatidic acid  -induced cell migration by directly binding to the carboxyl-terminal tail of the lpa <dig> receptor through its lim domains  <cit> . moreover, trip <dig> might enhance cell migration by binding to pdz domain of magi-1b/pten destabilizing membrane β-catenin and e-cadherin junctional complexes, promoting cell motility  <cit> .

the development of strategies to selectively represent the as transcripts repertoire, requiring small amounts of total rna, will be important for generating more correlated information between as transcripts and specific cell types and conditions in a transcriptome-wide format.

in spite of using sanger sequencing in this study, our approach is completely suitable for using with next-generation sequencers  <cit> , with the possibility of decreasing the number of pcr cycles, and consequently the redundancy level of the library; and assaying multiple barcoded samples with high sequence coverage in a single run. finally, the use of next generation sequencers would tremendously expand the applicability of our approach toward characterizing cancer cell transcriptome diversity resulting from as.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we presented a method for exploring as from any rna source that generates reliable as data in a transcriptome-wide format. additionally, our data identified as transcript candidates whose expression was influenced by erbb2-mediated expression and can be tested as molecular markers for breast cancer. the association of such methodology with deep sequencing may be helpful for completely deciphering the cancer cell transcriptome and finding more precise molecular markers.
