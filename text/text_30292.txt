BACKGROUND
mammary gland development requires the coordinated action of hormones and growth factors  <cit> . embryonic development involves the formation of mammary placodes and rudimentary sprouts, while the majority of mammopoiesis occurs post-natally. functional development of the mammary gland is initiated at puberty upon secretion of the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone which instigate reciprocal signaling between the epithelium and stroma . by  <dig> –  <dig> weeks of age in the mouse, complex branching and elongation through the stroma results in an extensive network of ducts filling the entire mammary fat pad. during pregnancy, the secretory alveolar structures develop and functionally differentiate to enable milk production in late pregnancy and milk secretion during lactation. at weaning, the process of involution commences and involves extensive remodeling of the mammary gland to a virgin-like state.

several signaling pathways and transcription factors have been shown to have essential roles in regulating mammary gland development in the mouse . deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor- <dig>  was first isolated in drosophila melanogaster as a novel dna-binding protein that binds an upstream response element of the homeotic gene deformed  <cit> . since its discovery, orthologues in human, rat and monkey have been identified and all exhibit a relatively low degree  of similarity to the drosophila protein  <cit> . the centrally located sand domain  along with the mynd domain  in the carboxy-terminus comprise the evolutionarily conserved structural regions of deaf- <dig> that have been extensively characterized in other transcription factors. the sand domain contains a nuclear localization signal  and appears to confer dna-binding activity  <cit> . the mynd domain is a cysteine-rich structure that likely mediates protein-protein interactions  <cit> . deaf- <dig> is the only known mammalian protein that contains both a sand and mynd domain. in drosophila, deaf- <dig> plays an important role in embryonic development, particularly in the segmentation stage following cuticle secretion  <cit> .

the mammalian deaf- <dig> protein was first identified in an affinity-binding screen using a synthetic retinoic acid response element . deaf- <dig> transcripts appear to be widely distributed in rat and mouse tissues  <cit> , with highest levels present in the central nervous system, dorsal root ganglia, submandibular gland, epidermis and mammary placodes of the embryo  <cit> , and the brain, lung and spleen in the adult  <cit> . at a biochemical level, deaf- <dig> has been shown to interact with lmo <dig>  a lim-only adaptor protein, as well as with members of the nuclear clim/ldb protein family  <cit> . disruption of deaf- <dig> in mice revealed that it is important for neural tube closure and skeletal patterning  <cit> . deaf-1-deficient mice displayed exencephaly, transformation of cervical segments and rib cage abnormalities, albeit with incomplete penetrance. interestingly, lmo4-deficient mice also exhibited neural tube defects and homeotic transformations  <cit> , suggesting that lmo <dig> and deaf- <dig> act in a complex to mediate specific physiological functions. in the context of mammary tissue, conditional deletion of lmo <dig> in mouse mammary glands during pregnancy results in impaired alveolar development  <cit> . conversely, overexpression of lmo <dig> has been observed in greater than 50% of human breast cancers and lmo <dig> is oncogenic when overexpressed in the mammary glands of transgenic mice  <cit> .

given that deaf- <dig> is expressed in the mammary gland and forms a complex with lmo <dig>  we explored a potential role for deaf- <dig> in mammary epithelial cells. overexpression of deaf- <dig> in mcf10a cells revealed that deaf- <dig> plays a role in regulating the proliferation of human breast epithelial cells and increased ductal epithelial proliferation was also observed in young deaf- <dig> transgenic mice in the post-pubertal phase. concomitantly, decreased expression of pra and augmented side-branching were apparent in these mice. in contrast to lmo <dig>  overexpression of deaf- <dig> in transgenic mice did not induce mammary hyperplasia or tumors. finally, affymetrix gene profiling studies were carried out to explore potential deaf- <dig> target genes in mammary epithelial cells, leading to the identification of rac <dig> which encodes a small rho-like gtpase  <cit> .

RESULTS
deaf- <dig> enhances the proliferation of human mammary epithelial cells
to generate human breast epithelial cells stably overexpressing human deaf- <dig> protein, mcf10a cells were initially transfected with a vector containing the mouse ecotropic receptor  gene to generate mcf10a-ecor cells. these cells were subsequently infected with an ecotropic pbabe-puro retrovirus encoding deaf- <dig>  western blotting of whole cell lysates confirmed that deaf- <dig> was overexpressed in deaf-1-transduced mcf10a-ecor cells relative to control cells transduced with an empty vector .

the mcf10a cellular assay described by debnath et al  <cit>  was used to assess the effect of deaf- <dig> on breast epithelial cell proliferation and the formation of acinar structures. transduced cells were cultured for periods of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days, after which they were immunostained and evaluated by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. deaf- <dig> expression was detected using an antibody raised against an amino-terminal peptide in the deaf- <dig> protein. acini generated from mcf10a-ecor cells transduced with the deaf- <dig> retrovirus expressed high levels of deaf- <dig> protein, whereas deaf- <dig> expression was undetectable in control acini . to assess cell proliferation, acini were immunostained with anti-ki <dig> antibody. in general, proliferating cells were found to be restricted to the periphery of acini and were evident in both control and deaf-1-expressing acini following  <dig> and  <dig> days of culture. by  <dig> days, proliferation ceased in control acini which appeared organized and spherical . in contrast, deaf- <dig> overexpressing acini continued to proliferate, with a commensurate increase in the size and number of acini . the malignant isogenic mcf10ca1h cell line was included as a control as it generates abnormal acinar structures. the mcf10ca1h cell line was derived from tumors arising in mice that had been injected with the ha-ras transformed mcf10aneot cells, following transduction of parental mcf10a cells  <cit> . as expected, proliferation in mcf10ca1h acini was prolonged  and ki67-positive cells were observed up to  <dig> days in culture . reminiscent of mcf10ca1h acini, deaf- <dig> overexpressing acini also appeared more disorganized. apoptosis and polarity were assessed by tunel and anti-gm <dig> staining respectively but no differences were observed .

generation of deaf- <dig> transgenic mice
to evaluate the expression of deaf- <dig> during mammary development, rna was isolated from mouse mammary glands at different developmental stages and subjected to quantitative real-time pcr analysis. expression of deaf- <dig> was quantified relative to that of the luminal epithelial marker cytokeratin  <dig>  and was found to be expressed at all stages of mammary gland development, with slightly higher expression observed during pregnancy and lactation .

to investigate the effects of deaf- <dig> overexpression on mammary gland development and oncogenesis, we generated transgenic mice expressing a ha-tagged mouse deaf- <dig>  gene under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat . the mmtv-ltr is active in both virgin and pregnant mammary glands  <cit>  but reaches maximal activity during pregnancy since the long terminal repeat  of the mmtv promoter is activated by steroid hormones. the transgene included rabbit β-globin and simian virus  <dig>  intronic sequences to augment mrna stability, as well as a polyadenylation ) sequence . southern blot analysis of genomic dna from the offspring of founder mice demonstrated that five lines transmitted the transgene with variation in copy number evident . expression of the transgene was assessed by immunoprecipitation of mammary protein lysates from virgin, pregnant  and lactating  mice with anti-deaf- <dig> polyclonal antisera, followed by western blot analysis using an anti-ha antibody. abundant expression of the transgene was observed during pregnancy and lactation in two strains, deaf- <dig> and deaf- <dig> . immunoblotting of lysates prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-tubulin antibody provided a loading control .

deaf- <dig> transgenic mammary glands exhibit increased side-branching in young mice
analysis of young virgin transgenic mice  revealed an increase in the number of side-branches by wholemount and histological analyses . since fluctuation in ductal branching occurs during the estrous cycle, vaginal smears were stained with haematoxylin and eosin to ensure that mammary glands were harvested from mice at the same stage of the estrous cycle. for strain deaf- <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig> mice exhibited mammary glands with substantially increased side-branching compared with  <dig> out of  <dig> deaf- <dig> transgenic mice . although some variation in the degree of side-branching was noted amongst the sixteen control  mice analyzed, transgenic mice exhibited profoundly abnormal mammary glands compared to wild-type glands.

increased proliferation and altered expression of pra and prb in deaf- <dig> transgenic glands
side-branching occurs concomitantly with epithelial cell proliferation in pubertal mammary glands. in vivo brdu labeling was therefore used to quantify proliferation in transgenic and wild-type glands. transgenic  <dig> week-old virgin mice showed a marked increase in the number of proliferating cells . tunel staining was employed to quantify the number of apoptotic cells in the virgin glands but few tunel-positive cells were apparent and no difference was observed between transgenic and wild-type glands .

the progesterone receptor  isoforms together with wnt <dig> play important roles in development of the mammary ductal tree during puberty  <cit> . to assess the expression of pr in virgin mammary glands of transgenic mice, immunofluorescence was performed using anti-pra and anti-prb specific antibodies. fewer ductal epithelial cells were positive for pra in transgenic mammary glands relative to those from wild-type mice . detection of the prb isoform by immunostaining proved difficult, although low levels were seen in transgenic and wild-type glands . to quantify the number of pra-positive cells in wild-type versus transgenic mammary glands, immunohistochemistry was performed:  <dig>  ±  <dig> % ductal epithelial cells were pra-positive in transgenic glands compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in wild-type glands . wnt <dig> expression was assessed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis but no difference was observed between transgenic and wild-type glands .

deaf- <dig> transgenic mammary glands appear normal during pregnancy, lactation and involution and do not develop tumors
wholemounts and histological sections were prepared from transgenic  and wild-type mice at the following stages of mammary gland development:  <dig> and  <dig> days of pregnancy,  <dig> and  <dig> days of lactation, and  <dig> and  <dig> days of involution. all transgenic mammary glands appeared morphologically normal. figure  <dig> shows representative wholemounts and sections harvested from transgenic and wild-type mice at pregnancy, lactation and involution. at least three mice of each genotype were analyzed for each stage.

to investigate the oncogenic potential of deaf- <dig> in the mammary gland, pituitary isografting was employed to recapitulate pregnancy and increase mmtv-ltr-driven deaf- <dig> expression  <cit> . two pituitary glands from fvb/n mice were transplanted into each inguinal mammary gland of  <dig> week-old transgenic and wild-type mice, which were then maintained for  <dig> months. mice presenting with tumors  prior to  <dig> months were sacrificed early. although two out of thirteen  deaf- <dig> transgenic mice developed mammary tumors within  <dig> months of age, one out of ten wild-type mice  developed a tumor during this period. moreover, deaf- <dig> transgenic glands did not exhibit hyperplasia. we therefore conclude that overexpression of deaf- <dig> is not sufficient to induce mammary tumors.

rac <dig> is a potential target gene of deaf- <dig> in the mammary gland
to investigate potential target genes of deaf- <dig>  primary mammary epithelial cells  were isolated from a deaf-1-/- mouse and immortalised by transduction with a retrovirus encoding the human papilloma virus  e6/e <dig> proteins. two mec clones were selected and transduced with either an empty retrovirus or one encoding deaf- <dig>  rna was subsequently isolated from cells at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-transduction for affymetrix analysis and protein lysates were prepared for western blot analysis. in addition, cells were plated on coverslips to assess deaf- <dig> protein expression at each time-point by immunofluorescence. high levels of deaf- <dig> expression were demonstrated in cells transduced with the deaf- <dig> retrovirus relative to control cells following a  <dig> hour selection in puromycin . this time-point was therefore selected for further analysis.

to compare the gene expression profiles of deaf-1-transduced mecs relative to deaf-1-deficient mecs, affymetrix analysis was performed using the genechip® mouse expression set  <dig>  <dig>  array which comprises  <dig>  transcripts on a single array. total rna was harvested from two independent clones  infected with either control or deaf-1-expressing retrovirus, representing four samples in total. clones c <dig> and e <dig> were treated as biological replicates in the subsequent analysis. notably, the top gene differentially expressed between deaf- <dig> and control samples following hybridization to affymetrix chips was deaf- <dig> itself. table  <dig> lists the top  <dig> genes that were expressed in a differential manner with a p-value less than  <dig> . this order was based on calculation of the t statistic, which is a measure of consistency between the two clones, c <dig> and e <dig>  the top five differentially expressed genes obtained from this analysis were: deaf- <dig>  eif4g <dig>  agbl <dig> kng <dig> and rac <dig> 

rac <dig> appeared to be of most interest since its expression has previously been reported in breast cancer epithelial cells  <cit> . to validate whether rac <dig> was a potential target of deaf- <dig>  real-time rt-pcr analysis was performed. an increase in rac <dig> levels was confirmed , as was also observed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis . to further examine the correlation between rac <dig> and deaf- <dig> expression, rt-pcr analysis was performed on rna derived from wild-type and deaf- <dig> transgenic mammary glands. increased expression of rac <dig> was observed in mmtv-deaf- <dig> transgenic samples . although a single wild-type mouse showed the same level of rac <dig> mrna as transgenic glands, all other wild-type mice exhibited substantially lower levels of rac <dig>  therefore, it seems likely that rac <dig> represents a bona fide target gene.

discussion
the deaf- <dig> transcription factor has been implicated in a number of developmental processes, including skeletal patterning and neural tube closure in the mouse embryo  <cit> . to further understand the role of deaf- <dig> in breast epithelial cells, we examined the effect of deaf- <dig> overexpression in mcf10a cells and in the mammary glands of transgenic mice. mcf10a breast epithelial cells exhibit many characteristics of normal breast epithelium including hormone and growth factor-responsive growth in three-dimensional cultures and the inability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner  <cit> . overexpression of deaf- <dig> in mcf10a cells was found to enhance cellular proliferation in mammary acini but no change was observed in the number of apoptotic cells or in cell polarity.

overexpression of deaf- <dig> in the mammary glands of transgenic mice led to a proliferative defect and a striking increase in the number of side-branches in young post-pubertal mice. the phenotype observed in the deaf- <dig> transgenic mice was transient as it was no longer evident in older adult mice at  <dig> weeks of age. no pronounced defects were evident in deaf-1-deficient mice, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms . interestingly, a transient delay in ductal development has previously been observed in virgin mice expressing a dominant negative form of lmo <dig>   <cit> . a transient phenotype has also been reported in bim knockout mice  <cit> . the increased number of side-branches occurring within the mammary glands of young females in two transgenic strains was accompanied by a significant increase in the proportion of brdu-positive cells. in addition, decreased expression of the progesterone receptor isoform pra was observed in mmtv-deaf- <dig> transgenic mammary glands. approximately 62% of ductal epithelial cells in wild-type mammary glands at  <dig> weeks expressed pra, in agreement with previous findings  <cit> . however, a two-fold decrease in the number of pra-positive ductal epithelial cells was apparent in transgenic mammary glands. in the mouse mammary gland it is relevant that the progesterone receptor exists predominantly as the pra isoform, and that the ratio of pra to prb is estimated to be 2: <dig>  <cit> . it has previously been shown that prb is essential for tertiary side-branching in the mammary gland during puberty  <cit>  and that pra has the ability to suppress prb-mediated mammary proliferation  <cit> . interestingly, the majority of pra-expressing epithelial cells do not proliferate in the virgin mammary gland, whereas prb colocalises extensively with brdu-labeled cells, a marker of proliferation  <cit> . thus the increased proliferation and aberrant side-branching observed in deaf- <dig> transgenic mice may reflect an elevated prb:pra ratio, resulting from decreased expression of pra in these glands. the pra gene could not be identified as a target in the affymetrix analysis since a specific probe for pra does not exist. it therefore remains to be determined whether down-regulation of pra expression by deaf- <dig> occurs via a direct or indirect mechanism.

interrogation of affymetrix gene arrays revealed a small number of genes that were differentially expressed in deaf-1-expressing mecs versus deaf-1-null mecs. only the top two genes exhibited a greater than two-fold change but all genes in table  <dig> had high t statistic values. elevated rac <dig> levels in deaf-1-expressing mecs could be demonstrated by real-time pcr analysis. functional analysis of the promoter region of rac <dig> revealed the presence of multiple deaf- <dig> binding sites but luciferase reporter assays were inconclusive . this does not preclude direct regulation of rac <dig> by deaf- <dig> via further upstream or downstream regulatory elements and requires more extensive analyses using a large genomic region spanning the entire rac <dig> gene. interestingly, mammary glands of deaf- <dig> transgenic mice had increased levels of rac <dig> mrna compared to wild-type mammary glands. thus, it appears that rac <dig> may be a genuine target gene of deaf- <dig>  recently, a study of transgenic mice expressing activated rac <dig> in the mammary epithelium revealed that the glands underwent incomplete involution, with epithelial islands persisting up to nine months postpartum. these mice also developed benign mammary gland lesions  <cit> . we did not observe delayed involution in deaf- <dig> transgenic mice analyzed. however, mice were only analyzed up to  <dig> days postpartum . further assessment of the relationship between rac <dig> and deaf- <dig> may require analysis of deaf- <dig> transgenic mammary glands several months postpartum to determine whether deaf- <dig> overexpression leads to altered mammary gland physiology.

activated rac <dig> has been linked to deregulated p21-activated kinase  and c-jun n-terminal kinase  activities in human cancer cells  <cit> . subsequently, activation of rac <dig> was found to be critical for integrin and growth factor-mediated regulation of cellular migration and adhesion  <cit> , which are important steps in the progression of metastatic disease. depletion of rac <dig> from bt <dig> breast carcinoma cells by rnai strongly inhibited cell invasion revealing a role for this gtpase in breast cancer metastasis  <cit> . intriguingly, these functions may parallel the proliferative, migratory and invasive functions ascribed to lmo <dig>  a partner of deaf- <dig>  in human breast cancer cell lines  <cit> . although lmo <dig> transgenic mice develop hyperplasia and mammary intraepithelial neoplasia or adenosquamous carcinoma  <cit> , overexpression of deaf- <dig> did not lead to mammary tumors. further insight may come from investigating rac <dig> as a potential target gene of the endogenous deaf-1/lmo <dig> protein complex in normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells.

CONCLUSIONS
our data have revealed that the transcription factor deaf- <dig> regulates the proliferation of human and mouse mammary epithelial cells. enforced expression of deaf- <dig> in transgenic mice led to increased proliferation and side-branching in post-pubertal mammary glands but was not oncogenic. together with the perturbed pra:prb ratio and the known role of pr in side-branching, these data suggest that deaf- <dig> may regulate the expression of pr. finally, we have identified the small gtpase-encoding gene rac <dig> as a potential target of deaf- <dig> in the developing mammary gland.
