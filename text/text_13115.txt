BACKGROUND
genome maps for livestock species are necessary to identify genes affecting economically important production traits. linkage maps, based primarily on highly polymorphic, anonymous microsatellite markers, have been important for identifying chromosomal regions influencing economically important traits in cattle  <cit> . because a lack of recombination between closely linked markers limits resolution, and because cattle linkage maps  <cit>  contain few genes, linkage maps are of limited value for ordering closely linked markers and identifying genes underlying quantitative trait loci . the radiation hybrid  approach allows mapping monomorphic markers for genes and can provide a higher resolution for ordering close markers  <cit> , but high breakage frequency rh data are less reliable than linkage data for ordering widely separated groups of markers  <cit> . integrating linkage and rh data into a single map will refine marker order to facilitate genomic sequencing and will also increase the efficiency of identifying genes associated with qtl.

integrated analysis of both linkage data and rh data allows each source of information to complement the other, providing coarse to intermediate scale maps of the bovine genome, populated with gene markers to facilitate discovery of positional candidate genes for qtl. these integrated maps will lack the fine scale of complete genome sequence, but represent a resource useful for gene identification through comparative mapping approaches, using more complete genome sequence and annotation from other organisms. similarity between segments of bovine dna and genomic sequence from other species may supplement integrated data to predict the location of unmapped genes in the bovine genome  <cit> . a comprehensive integrated map, containing all identified genes and markers, will simplify database queries and reduce ambiguity inherent in mining information from other mammals.

an integrated map can also provide a framework for assembling bovine genomic sequence as data becomes available. a well-ordered map of sequence-tagged-sites  was essential for assembling the human sequence  <cit> . the national institutes of health  identified the bovine genome as high priority for sequencing  <cit> , and sequencing is underway. one pivotal criterion to classifying the bovine genome as ready for sequencing was the availability of well-maintained genetic and physical maps; integrating these maps will provide additional support for sequence assembly.

integration of linkage and rh maps has been reported for a number of species  <cit>  and individual bovine chromosomes  <cit> . the general approach to integrated mapping has been to score several markers from linkage maps on an rh panel, then align the independent maps via common markers. nadkarni  <cit>  and white et al.  <cit>  described procedures to synthesize information from multiple independent maps onto a single merged map. these approaches do not directly use data contributing to each map, but merge results of independent analyses. a fundamentally different approach is to merge independent data sets with common markers, so each data set contributes to constructing a single integrated map. agarwala et al.  <cit>  developed procedures for integrating rh maps where markers common to independent rh panels contributed to the solution of a comprehensive rh map. schiex et al.  <cit> , developed procedures and released carthagene software  <cit>  to merge and solve integrated maps representing multiple linkage and rh data sets.

a large volume of data are being generated in cattle and other livestock species that is not rapidly reflected in current map representations. the result is a lack of truly up-to-date maps of any livestock species, as the maps may lag by months or years in their representation of existing data. it is not feasible to devote significant human resources to constantly maintain and update these maps, so it is critical that automated procedures be developed to free human map curators from many of the time-consuming, error-prone tasks experienced in the mapping process. existing map construction software is automated to the extent that the likelihoods of many alternative marker orders can be evaluated with a single command, but the entire process of gathering and formatting raw data, constructing maps, examining results and publishing on the internet, or elsewhere, requires human intervention at several stages. automated procedures will streamline the process in order to focus human effort on the critical stages of verifying raw data and examining the resulting maps.

bovine chromosome   <dig> provides an interesting example to study the integration of linkage and rh data, and comparison of the bovine to the human genome. a qtl for meat tenderness has been reported on bovine chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . comparative mapping indicates that alternating segments of human chromosome   <dig> are conserved on bta  <dig> and bta  <dig>  <cit> . we combined the available linkage and rh data to further examine bta  <dig>  an integrated linkage and rh map was constructed using carthagene software , and the comparative positions of dna sequences shared by segments of hsa  <dig> and the integrated bta  <dig> map were established. we also assessed the potential for automating integrated mapping procedures, anticipating a need to extend integration to the entire bovine genome in order to provide up-to-date maps.

RESULTS
the low resolution of the bovine linkage map is indicated by multiple markers sharing the same map position, even when they may be separated by a substantial physical distance. inclusion of rh data provides additional evidence by which markers that are inseparable only with linkage data can be ordered. the bta  <dig> linkage map  shows  <dig> markers placed in  <dig> distinct positions, with ten positions representing a pair of markers and seven representing three markers. marker separation on the higher resolution rh map is greater , with  <dig> markers mapped to  <dig> distinct positions. projected onto a common scale, the integrated map represents  <dig> markers in  <dig> different positions . eighteen positions contain two markers, at three positions three markers are represented, and one position is occupied by four markers.

integrated rh and linkage maps
markers common to both the linkage and rh data sets provide a basis for integrating the data and constructing maps representing both types of data. primer sequences associated with the rh and linkage markers indicated  <dig> common markers in the two data sets, with  <dig> markers unique to the linkage data and  <dig> unique to rh, for a total of  <dig> markers represented on the integrated linkage-rh map.

four sets of markers with different primer sequences matching the same bovine sequence were identified. in two instances , markers in the set were placed adjacent to each other by the map building routine. in the two other cases , markers in the set were separated by several markers after initial map construction. in both cases, the map could be reordered so markers in each set were placed next to each other without decreasing likelihood of the map. the final integrated order includes these manual adjustments, so that in all cases of different markers matching the same sequence, the markers are adjacent on the map.

comparison of the integrated map to independently solved linkage  and rh  maps indicates relatively good agreement between the maps. product-moment correlations between independent  and integrated  map positions were greater than  <dig>  for both the linkage and rh maps. the final integrated map did suggest some rearrangement of both the linkage and rh maps. solved using crimap, the integrated map order of linkage markers was somewhat more likely than the order of the independent linkage map . this result suggests that the most likely order identified by the integrated mapping process had not been evaluated while using crimap to construct the linkage map. because of differences in speed, carthagene can feasibly evaluate many more orders than crimap; even without integration with rh data, carthagene might be utilized to identify errors in marker order and refine linkage maps.

comparison of the integrated map to the rh map shows the markers remained in the five blocks identified by gautier et al.  <cit> , and the order of those blocks is the same for both maps . some markers were reordered within blocks of the rh map. as with the linkage map, the integrated map order was more likely than the original independent map order .

comparative bovine and human map
comparative map positions for  <dig> markers mapped to bta <dig> were established using primersearch  <cit>  to identify bovine dna sequence associated with each marker, and subsequent blastn against hsa <dig> contig sequences. positions of the bovine-human matches were between  <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  mbp on the hsa <dig> draft sequence . percentage identities of the matches ranged from 83%  to 100% , with a mean of 93% . the syntenic group segments  identified by gautier et al.  <cit>  were retrieved in the comparison of the integrated bta <dig> map with hsa <dig> . the integrated bta <dig> map covers approximately 32% of hsa <dig>  there are eight gaps in coverage containing between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp of hsa <dig> sequence. boundaries of the syntenic segments encompass 36% of the loci on hsa <dig> , not counting the  <dig> loci within large internal gaps in s <dig>  and s <dig> . some of these gaps in hsa <dig> coverage are syntenic with bta <dig>  <cit> . our current bta <dig> linkage map places at least one marker in each of the previously identified segments shared by hsa <dig> and bta <dig>  accounting for another 15% of hsa <dig> sequence. accounting for segments shared with bta <dig> leaves  <dig> gaps containing from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp of hsa <dig> sequence that has not been shown to be homologous to mapped regions of bovine chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  although two of the gaps are located within syntenic segments s <dig> and s <dig> 

a syntenic group segments s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s4' identified by gautier et al. . gaps are relatively long segments within a syntenic group that do not contain sequence common to hsa <dig> and bovine chromosome  <dig> . segments designated >qtl and <qtl are  <dig> mb segments of hsa <dig> centered around syntenic markers defining boundaries of s <dig>  and s <dig> , flanking the bta <dig> meat tenderness qtl identified by keele et al. . all syntenic regions represents the union of s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s4'. entire chromosome includes all loci with a position established on hsa <dig> sequence.

markers more recent  <cit>  than the original description of the meat tenderness qtl  <cit>  have resulted in some rearrangment of the bta <dig> map, so position of the qtl must be shifted to current positions of markers defining the qtl region. the syntenic segment s <dig> contains several markers that were within the 95% confidence interval surrounding the qtl, but the two markers most closely flanking the qtl peak, hel <dig> and bms <dig>  could not be matched to hsa <dig> sequence and are between defined boundaries of syntenic group segments s <dig> and s <dig>  because this qtl region includes a break in bovine-human synteny, the ends of both syntenic segments should be examined to identify positional candidate loci influencing the tenderness qtl. human loci, in two  <dig> mbp segments surrounding the boundaries of s <dig> and s <dig> that flank the qtl peak, were identified and associated with gene ontology  terms to further describe genes near the qtl. these two segments contain  <dig> loci ;  <dig> of these loci have go annotation  <cit> ) with terms representing various biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions . the go annotation of loci in both syntenic segments near the qtl may guide further marker development to fine-map the qtl by associations between new markers and tenderness. adding new markers to this region will also refine boundaries of s <dig> and s <dig>  and position of the breakpoint between these two segments.

order is well conserved within syntenic group segments s <dig>  s <dig>  s4' and portions of s <dig> and s <dig>  the most notable rearrangements within segments are an inversion of several markers in the center of s <dig>  and inconsistent ordering within a subset of s <dig>  the internal rearrangements within syntenic groups found here, pig-human rearrangements  <cit> , and mouse-human rearrangements  <cit>  suggest that precise ordering requires reliable data from the species of interest. comparative information can be used to predict gene location in regions where within-species mapping data are not available  <cit>  or the available data are ambiguous, and may guide marker development and fine-mapping efforts in specific regions  <cit> . marker orders based on comparative data, however, should be used with caution. for each systenic segment of bta  <dig>  marker orders predicted from human order were less likely than the order identified from bovine data .

challenges for building high-resolution integrated maps and leveraging data from various sources, both within and across species, will be to determine regions where additional data may be informative and placing appropriate emphasis on the different sources of information at different levels of resolution. linkage maps can provide the scaffold for ordering an entire chromosome, so linkage data may receive the greatest emphasis for initially determining a coarse order. increased emphasis should be given to higher resolution rh and other physical mapping data to resolve order where placement of linkage markers is uncertain, and markers are too close to provide definitive order. comparative sequence and mapping information from other species should be most useful to position markers within regions where physical data have insufficient resolution and within-species sequence data are not available. using appropriate weights to combine genetic and physical mapping data, within-species sequence and comparative sequence data should allow the different data sources to complement each other, resulting in consensus maps supported by the combined sources of information.

automation
genome maps of livestock species need to represent current information in order to maximize utility of the maps. positions of putative qtl may become misleading if qtl positions are not updated to reflect subtle rearrangements resulting from new mapping data. genes associated with phenotypic variation will be more readily identified if available information to link mapping data to genes and their function is maintained. continually updating the maps to depict relevant existing information will be facilitated by automation, but a number of issues must be addressed for implementation of automated procedures to be fruitful.

access to dynamic sources of mapping data must be maintained, so that new information can be incorporated into the maps soon after it is generated. information to connect data from various sources must be available to expedite integration. map computation strategies deserve some attention, to minimize the delay between acquiring new data and appearance of those data in subsequent maps.

procedures developed to integrate bta <dig> linkage and rh data can be applied to available data for the entire bovine genome. the integration effort will be more valuable, however, if sources of data for the integrated map are periodically updated. success of a comprehensive integration effort will also depend on information available to establish connections between the data sets. one alternative is to resolve marker nomenclature, perhaps by developing and maintaining a database of marker names and synonyms. a more straightforward, and easily automated, approach is to use primer sequences as universal identifiers to establish connections between mapping data sets. database curation efforts to associate mapping records  with primer pairs may be more worthwhile than attempts to resolve all possible names for a given marker.

primer sequence can also be used to establish connections to sequence databases. sequence similarity searches should reveal connections to sts sequences associated with markers; the process will also identify connections to other sequences, including more completely annotated and assembled sequence. sequences identified in this process can be used to establish connections with human and other well annotated, assembled genomic sequence for comparative mapping. similar associations between mapping and sequence data may be established using marker and locus names, provided that marker nomenclature can be resolved sequence-based connections between mapping data sets, integrated maps, and genomic sequence may be more reliable and are more amenable to automation than attempts to connect sources using names and other information.

connections between maps and annotated sequence can accelerate positional candidate gene discovery if the sequence annotation includes functional information. harhay and keele  <cit>  used go and go-annotated human sequence to link livestock est with function; mapping the est can extend their procedures to relate map position to function. connecting map positions to go terms requires synchronizing several information sources, including livestock maps, human sequence annotated go terms, and go databases.

placement of new markers on integrated maps must keep pace with new marker development, if integrated maps are to remain current with available mapping and sequence data, the basic concept of map construction, finding the most likely marker order out of all possible orders, is conceptually simple but computationally demanding, because the number of possible orders increases factorially with the number of markers. evaluating all possible marker orders is not feasible when mapping data represents more than twenty or thirty markers on a chromosome. cost and time constraints limit map construction to strategies that evaluate a sufficient number of possible orders to ensure that a reasonably good order is identified.

as bovine sequence data becomes available, methods to exploit that resource to refine both the integrated maps and sequence assemblies must be implemented. advent of whole-genome sequence assemblies has not diminished the value of maps in sequenced species. discrepancies between human maps and sequence assemblies have been noted  <cit> , although concordance between a snp linkage map and sequence assemblies increased in later assemblies  <cit> . a comprehensive linkage-rh map has been used to validate mouse sequence assemblies, revealing cases of significant inversions and translocations in sequence, as well as confirming sequence order in other regions where the sequence order disagrees with previous mouse rh maps  <cit> . an integrated linkage-rh map of the rat suggests some errors in the draft sequence, but more importantly, provides a mechanism to anchor qtl on the genomic sequence  <cit> .

the strategies employed must be sufficiently flexible to allow manual manipulation of the resulting maps. some evidence, such as sts markers sharing the same sequence, and ordering information from other species, is not easily represented in linkage and rh mapping data. in some cases of markers sharing the same sequence, markers can be forced to share the same position, or data from multiple markers can be combined to create a single haplotype representing multiple markers. marker orders suggested by maps of other species may be compared with likely orders identified from within-species data. incorporating information not directly represented in mapping data can require manually evaluating additional orders, and making some judgement about which results are most acceptable.

in exploratory analyses merging bta <dig> linkage and rh data, simulated annealing and taboo search algorithms in carthagene were explored as methods of initially ordering the integrated map, before refinement with the polish and flips routines. resulting maps were similar to the map presented, but required more than  <dig> hours to compute. the map presented was initially ordered by placing each marker against a pair of markers common to both data sets, and was constructed in less than four hours. another approach involved initially placing markers against the set of all markers common to both the linkage and rh data sets, in the linkage map order. while map construction was somewhat faster using this approach, the resulting map was less likely than the map initiated from a pair of markers and showed greater disagreement with the linkage map.

parallelization of the mapping algorithms can substantially increase the speed of map construction. likelihoods of a number of alternative orders must be computed at several steps during the map building process. if these calculations are distributed across multiple processors, time required to compute all likelihoods and arrive at a final order will be reduced because computations are performed simultaneously. increased parallelization should also increase the feasibility of implementing more thorough algorithms that examine a larger number of possible orders, therefore increasing the probability of identifying more likely maps.

CONCLUSIONS
linkage and radiation hybrid maps are powerful tools to facilitate discovery of genomic regions and ultimately genes influencing livestock production traits. combining linkage and rh data can provide more accurate, consolidated maps representing more information, especially if the maps are connected to well annotated genomic sequence. automating map construction and comparative mapping procedures will expedite construction of whole-genome integrated maps and maintaining a comprehensive resource as new data becomes available. success of automated procedures to connect data from various sources and construct integrated maps depends on information available to establish connections between data; sequence-based approaches to connect data are preferrable.
