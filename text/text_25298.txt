BACKGROUND
it has been proposed that the majority of modern dog breeds recognised today have resulted from two population bottlenecks in dog evolution  <cit> . during the first genetic bottleneck, pre-domestic breeds diverged from wolves some  <dig>  years ago, probably through multiple domestication events. the second bottleneck for most breeds occurred within the last few hundred years, when the breed creation process resulted in the loss of genetic variation due to strong bottleneck events which occurred in parallel with strong artificial selection for behavioural and physical characteristics favoured by humans.

the same bottlenecks and artificial selection forces that generated these breed-specific features have, in some instances, provoked undesired health effects. random fixation of detrimental variants can occur during bottlenecks. similarly, risk alleles may be in linkage disequilibrium with selected phenotypic variants or these may have pleiotropic effects  <cit> .

several studies have previously aimed to identify genomic regions involved in defined traits and their relationship with disease using association mapping . however, phenotypic traits that have been driven to fixation by genetic drift or artificial selection within a dog breed cannot be mapped within that breed with this approach. an alternative in these cases is selection mapping, in which selective sweeps  are searched  <cit> . the aim of this work was to identify selective sweeps in the boxer genome resulting from the breed creation process using high density genome-wide snp data. these regions are likely to govern phenotypic traits of interest and may be linked to overrepresentation of certain genetic disorders in this breed.

RESULTS
detection and replication in boxer
regions of homozygosity  in the canis familiaris chromosomes  were identified in  <dig> boxers from the united kingdom  which had been genotyped on microarrays for ~ <dig>  snps . eight rohs meeting the criteria detailed in methods were detected , representing  <dig> mb  of the dog genome. three of these rohs, two on cfa  <dig> and one on cfa  <dig>  showed a remarkable extended low heterozygosity . to confirm these rohs, a second dataset  was generated using a higher density snp array . this related to boxers collected from different geographical locations to set a. in set b,  <dig> rohs were found, which spanned  <dig>  mb  of the dog genome. three regions on cfa x  were discarded as these were not present when only female samples were analyzed . five rohs were shared in both sets . in general, these were notably shorter and/or split into two separated shorter regions when a higher number of samples and snps were genotyped . conversely, the first  <dig> mb of cfa  <dig> showed almost total loss of heterozygosity  in both sets . there was a single snp  with maf =  <dig>  within the region of extended homozygosity on cfa  <dig> , closer examination of which showed that heterozygous genotypes had been called for all boxer samples. possible explanations might be wrong genotype call from intensity data or a structural variation affecting that single snp. to avoid the concern about snps significantly deviating from hardy-weinberg equilibrium  affecting the identification of rohs the analysis was repeated in set b after the removal of snps with hwe test p-value <  <dig> , which resulted in similar results . for the subsequent analyses we focused on the rohs on cfa 1: <dig> ,420- <dig> , <dig> bp and cfa 26: <dig> ,718- <dig> , <dig> bp because these had markedly larger size and lower levels of variation than other regions common in both sets . finally, we found a region of increased heterozygosity on cfa 9: <dig> ,590- <dig> , <dig> bp , closer examination of which revealed a region of approximately  <dig>  mb showing a pattern of alternate heterozygous and homozygous genotypes indicating a cnv .

1a subset of ~ <dig>  snps shared with the illumina's caninesnp <dig> was used for this breed.

presence in other breeds
since reduction of genetic polymorphism in a region can result from strong selection and brachycephaly is a breed-defining trait in the boxer, we evaluated the presence of the rohs on cfa  <dig> and  <dig> in non-brachycephalic and brachycephalic breeds. brachycephaly is characterized by severe shortening of the muzzle, and therefore the underlying bones, and a more modest shortening and widening of the skull  <cit> . for both selective sweeps on cfas  <dig> and  <dig>  normal levels of heterozygosity were observed in non-brachycephalic dog breeds and the iberian wolf , based on a first dataset containing  <dig> samples from  <dig> different dog breeds and  <dig> iberian wolf samples genotyped using the same panel of snps as in set a and on a second dataset containing  <dig> samples from german shepherd dog genotyped using the same panel of snps as in set b .

the selective sweep on cfa  <dig> was present and showed allelic match with the boxer  in other brachycephalic breeds such as english bulldog, pug and french bulldog although in the latter the reduction in heterozygosity was not as extended as in the other two breeds and seemed to be located slightly upstream in the chromosome . the selective sweep on cfa  <dig> was detected with allele-matching in english bulldog  and french bulldog  . although the roh was not apparent in the pug in figure  <dig>  in the segment of the roh shared between boxer and english and french bulldogs a good number of snps in pug samples showed the same genotypes as the other three brachycephalic breeds. in addition, the snps comprised between  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> bp  were nearly fixed in the pug . in contrast to the boxer, a distribution of genotypes in hwe was seen for bicf2g <dig>  in the bulldog breeds studied whereas it was fixed in the pug .

within the snps making up the illumina's caninesnp <dig> only two covered the cnv on cfa  <dig> , both of them highly monomorphic with the exception of the snp at position  <dig> , <dig> bp for the shar pei samples for which an excess of heterozygous genotypes  were observed. a pattern of excessive heterozygous genotypes was observed for the region corresponding to the cnv on cfa  <dig> in the breeds genotyped with the illumina's caninehd beadchip .

genetic content and functional annotation analysis
the region of decreased heterozygosity which was observed on cfa  <dig> in our study overlapped with a region previously associated with canine brachycephaly  <cit> . this was detected using dogs from brachycephalic breeds and non-brachycephalic breeds to perform across-breed association and selection mapping. both strategies identified a region on cfa  <dig> at  <dig> mb. the decrease in the averaged observed heterozygosity of brachycephalic dogs relative to non-brachycephalic dogs is indicative of a selective sweep at this position. genes which have been associated with brachycephaly on cfa  <dig> include: thbs <dig> , which is expressed in bone and cartilage during development and in the adult skeleton  <cit> , and smoc <dig> , similar in sequence to bm- <dig>  which is expressed primarily during embryogenesis and in adult bone tissue  <cit> .

the roh in boxer on cfa 26: <dig> ,718- <dig> , <dig> bp contained  <dig> annotated elements of which  <dig>  were genes with an associated name; this level was similar to that observed in the whole dog genome . the roh from cfa  <dig> mapped to two adjacent syntenic regions on homo sapiens chromosome   <dig> . advantage was taken of the fact that the region in the human genome syntenic to the region of interest on cfa  <dig> was better annotated and could be used to perform functional annotation analysis through the use of ingenuity pathways analysis software  <cit> . one hundred and six dog to human orthologs annotated elements were used as input, resulting in a list of biological processes and disease categories that would be enriched given the genes in the region of interest. amongst functional categories related to biological processes, skeletal and muscular system development and function as well as tissue morphology were the two most significantly associated categories . also, the selective sweep on cfa  <dig> contained genes that are linked to inherited diseases overrepresented in the boxer  <cit>  . lymphoblastic lymphoma is a type of non-hodgkin lymphoma characterised by uncontrolled growth of either t- or b-cells and associated with pole . the frequency of t-cell lymphoma in the boxer is higher than in other breeds  <cit> . dilated cardiomyopathy   is a disorder characterised by cardiac enlargement , poor myocardial contractility, and congestive heart failure. myl <dig>  is involved in the development of the sarcomere and muscle contraction and has also been associated with cardiomyopathy of the heart ventricle.

the upper part of the table  refers to the selective sweep present in the boxer only . the lower part of the table  refers to the part of the selective sweep shared in the three breeds cfa 26: <dig> ,679- <dig> , <dig> bp. genomic positions in the dog genome and their annotated involvement in biological process and diseases  are listed.

cfa 26: <dig> ,679- <dig> , <dig> bp defined the region where extended homozygosity was common in boxer, english bulldog and french bulldog , which comprised six genes significant in the functional annotation analysis . of these genes, atp6v0a <dig>  and eif2b <dig>  are of special interest because they are involved in genetic disorders in humans. various loss-of-function mutations of atp6v0a <dig> , which encodes the alpha- <dig> subunit of the v-type h+ atpase, resulting in impaired glycosilation of proteins during synthesis cause autosomal recessive cutis laxa  type ii  and some cases of wrinkly skin syndrome   <cit> . mutations in each of the five subunits of the translation initiation factor eif2b, including eif2a encoded by eif2b <dig> , can cause leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter   <cit> . vwm is a neurological disorder manifesting progressive cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, inconstant optic atrophy and relatively preserved mental abilities. setd <dig>  encodes a lysine methyltransferase that regulates tumor suppressor p <dig> protein  <cit> . to note, the region of ~ <dig> kb of nearly complete homozygosity in the pug is both upstream of these six genes and within the region of extended homozygosity shared amongst the three breeds. interestingly,  the genes involved in skeletal and muscular system development and tissue morphology that were significant in the functional annotation analysis in the boxer only  and  the region shared in boxer and english and french bulldogs, are both located within the region on cfa  <dig> that showed the greatest decay in the averaged observed heterozygosity .

the region of alternate heterozygous/homozygous genotypes patterns observed for cfa  <dig> in the boxers overlapped perfectly to a cnv previously described as being polymorphic in a number of dog breeds  <cit> . this  <dig> -mb cnv region contained three protein coding genes, one of which had two reported transcript variants, and four non coding rna genes . analysis of gene ontology biological process  terms revealed that the two transcript variants of the protein coding gene vps13d   were associated with processes of protein localization and viral envelope fusion with host membrane . this gene was also mapped to the hs 1: <dig> ,124- <dig> , <dig> bp but only the protein localization term was associated . the remaining annotated elements had neither go bp terms associated nor homology in h. sapiens.

discussion
the substitution of a strongly selected mutation produces a selective sweep on the frequency of neutral alleles at linked loci characterised by a reduction of the local genetic variation  <cit> . two selective sweeps detected on cfas  <dig> and  <dig> in the boxer genome were replicated in a larger sample size of the same breed obtained from a different geographical location and genotyped for a panel of snps of higher density. assessing both the presence of these regions in other breeds and their genetic content can provide information on how they affect the phenotype and relate to the ancestral origin of breeds.

in our study, the selective sweep previously associated with brachycephaly on cfa  <dig>  <cit>  was replicated in a larger sample of boxers and in samples from other brachycephalic breeds. moreover, samples in this study were from a different geographic area compared to the previous work  <cit>  , suggesting the selective sweep is shared in the two populations within each breed.

the selective sweep on cfa  <dig> indicates strong artificial selection of a trait of interest in the boxer, although the phenotypic trait resulting from this particular selective sweep is unknown. the sweep was not present in the iberian wolf, one ancient breed , labrador retrievers, german shepherd dogs or four hound breeds. on the other hand, it was present, although in shorter length, in english and french bulldogs, breeds that share with the boxer the brachycephalic trait and a related breed creation process. altogether, these results suggest that the selection of the sweep predated the formation of boxer and both bulldog breeds. it is known that the english bulldog contributed to the breed creation of both boxer and french bulldog breeds  <cit> . the boxer is believed to have originated from a long-existing and now extinct german breed, the bullenbeisser, which was crossed with a small number of english bulldog exemplars exported from the uk. likewise, the french bulldog originated from toy varieties of english bulldog that were more popular in france. moreover, it is interesting that the region of the selective sweep common in the three breeds coincides with the lowest reduction in the heterozygosity along the sequence . in selective sweeps, the reduction of genetic variation is lowest at the site of directional selection and not as great at distant sites due to recombination, although asymmetry in the valleys of reduced heterozygosity may provide imprecise information about the location of the sweep  <cit> . based on our data, it is hard to assess whether the selective sweep on cfa  <dig> shared in boxer and english and french bulldogs was also present in the pug, also a brachycephalic breed, because only a short segment of reduced polymorphism within the sweep was observed in this breed . nonetheless, the history of the pug differs from that of these three breeds mentioned before. the pug dates to the ancient china and it is suggested that interbreeding with pekingese, japanese chin and possibly shih tzu contributed to the breed creation process. pugs were imported to europe through holland around  <dig> s  <cit> .

a possible scenario is that the standing neutral variation on cfa  <dig> present in the original english bulldog was passed to both boxer and french bulldog during the breed creation process. some variants would have been beneficial thereafter when selection of brachycephaly started, which is reasonable to think that happened during the breeds creation process since brachycephaly is a breed standard in these three types of dogs. thus, strong selection of variants close to the position 8- <dig> mb on cfa  <dig> contributing to brachycephaly might have swept nearby genetic variation. variable selective sweep length in the three breeds would response to different breed histories as it depends on the strength of selection, the amount of recombination and the population size  <cit> . therefore, if one assumes the recombination rate to be similar across breeds for a given chromosome region, different across-breeds strength of selection and population sizes might have probably caused the variable length in the sweeps on cfa  <dig>  which in the boxer is more than ten times larger than in the french bulldog.

altogether we suggest that cfa  <dig> may contain a footprint of selection for brachycephaly, especially in the boxer. a brachycephalic head with a distinctive broad and blunt muzzle is a unique phenotype of the boxer and particular attention is given to this trait by the boxer breeding community. although brachycephaly has been mapped to cfa  <dig> and the greatest association was greater than  <dig> times more significant than the second highest, bannasch et al  <cit>  suggested that the complex nature of the brachycephalic head phenotype may be the result of associations across multiple chromosomes. verification as to whether the genome-wide significant markers on cfa  <dig>  the second highest association, previously reported  <cit>  are within the roh on cfa  <dig> in our data would provide some support for a link between this region and selection for brachycephaly. genes on cfa  <dig> which have been associated with brachycephaly are involved in skeletal development  <cit> . similarly, genes significant in functional annotation analysis of our data were associated with skeletal and muscular system development and function as well as tissue morphology biological process .

it is possible that the selection for certain breed-specific loci or locus might be in linkage disequilibrium with detrimental variants at other genes. interestingly, some of the genes in the selective sweep region on cfa  <dig> could be related to diseases that are reported to be more common in the boxer breed, particularly cancer  and cardiovascular disorders   <cit> .

in addition, we could observe in our data a previously reported cnv on cfa  <dig> polymorphic in multiple dog breeds  <cit> , providing evidence for within-breed variation in the number of segment copies. our data suggest that the cnv on cfa  <dig> is present and variable in the  <dig> boxers used in this study , as well as in other breeds such as german shepherd dog, pug and english and french bulldogs . we suggest this cnv may be also possibly present in the shar pei  although in this breed it should be confirmed with a panel of higher snp density. it might be that variable numbers of copies of a gene contained within the cnv such as vps13d , which is involved in entrance of virus into the host cell, might be functional in the susceptibility to viral infection. likewise, the non coding rnas  and small nuclear rnas  which precede a region relatively rich in genes  could be functional in regulatory processes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a selective sweep in excess of  <dig> mb on cfa  <dig> in the boxer which is not present in iberian wolves or non-brachycephalic dog breeds. this region is a candidate for strong artificial selection in the boxer for a trait of interest, possibly brachycephaly, and the inadvertent selection of genes during the enrichment for a certain phenotype may have given rise to an increased incidence of certain related afflictions in the breed. the fact that the selective sweep is also present in english and french bulldogs provides genetic evidence of a shared history of the three breeds.

furthermore, we provide supporting evidence for two previously described regions: a selective sweep on cfa  <dig> associated with canine brachycephaly and a cnv on cfa  <dig> which is polymorphic in multiple dog breeds and contains genetic elements with potential biological implications.
