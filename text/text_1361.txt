BACKGROUND
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , the most common form of motoneuron disease, is a relatively rare , progressive and fatal disease characterised by neurodegeneration involving primarily motor neurons of the cerebral cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. to date, most studies have focused upon the familial form of the disease, which accounts for less then 10% of cases, and which is usually inherited as autosomal dominant inheritance. the gene coding for copper/zinc superoxide dismutase  <dig>  appears to be mutated in 10–20% in the familial form  <cit> .

genetic risk factors for als have been extensively studied and some "major genes", in addition to sod <dig>  have been recognised as being responsible for the monogenic inheritance pattern. there are now at least six dominant inherited adult onset als genes of which only three have been identified so far  <cit> . however, most als cases seem to be a typical multifactorial disease deriving from the interaction between a number of genes and environmental factors, some of which are still not established as causing of the disease, including brain and spinal cord trauma, strenuous physical activity, exposure to radiation  <cit> .

current hypotheses suggest a complex interplay between multiple mechanisms including genetic risk factors, oxidative stress, neuroexcitatory toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, intermediate neurofilament disorganization, failure of intracellular mineral homeostasis involving zinc, copper, or calcium, disrupted axonal transport, abnormal protein aggregation or folding, and neuroinflammation  <cit> . recently there has been growing interest in the role played by non-neuronal neighbourhood cells in the pathogenesis of motor neuron injury and in the dysfunction of specific molecular signal pathways  <cit> .

among the genetic factors that may predispose to sporadic als, neurofilaments, apolipoprotein epsilon  <dig> genotype, excitotoxicity genes, ciliary neurotrophic factor , cytochrome p <dig> debrisoquine hydroxylase cyp2d <dig>  apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease , mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase sod <dig>  monoamine oxidase allele b and paraoxonases, have been reported in different studies, partly with contradictory results  <cit> . not all the published studies have been replicated, probably because of the different populations analysed as well as insufficient sample size. on the other hand, different studies have employed either tissue microdissection or microarray technologies to search for other "low penetrant" or "susceptibility" genes that are more common in the population and often polymorphic and the combination and interaction of these with environmental factors may contribute to modulate individual risk  <cit> . recently, several genome-wide association studies have been performed with innovative approaches, i.e. the illumina platform, and the authors have identified snps  potentially associated with als  <cit> . however most genome-wide association studies have not confidently identified risk genes that are replicated in every study. the most likely causes are disease heterogeneity, allelic heterogeneity, small effect sizes and probably, insufficient sample size. however, so far no microarrays panel has been specifically developed for als and the aetiology of the disease still remains to be defined.

some years ago our group had the opportunity of working on another multifactorial complex disease such as venous thrombosis and analysing the results by an innovative statistical approach, artificial neural networks   <cit> . indeed, anns promises to improve the predictive value of traditional statistical data analysis. initially, a known set of data, from a given problem with a known solution, is learned by the anns and subsequently the networks can reconstruct the fuzzy rules which may be underlying a complex set of data. anns have been successfully used in many areas of medicine as recently illustrated in an extensive review by lisboa  <cit> , as well as by ritchie et al  <cit>  where neural networks were used for supervised pattern recognition in genetic epidemiology, and also in snps association studies  <cit> . much effort has been spent to adapt anns architectures and the ensembles to specific problems to be solved. more specifically many novel computational approaches have been developed and applied with special attention to complex gene-gene, gene-environment interactions and anns  <cit> .

the literature data together with the impressive results we obtained with anns, by which we were able to identify a subset of polymorphisms related to the disease, prompted us to employ the same approach also in als hoping to discover specific genetic patterns underlying the sporadic form of this disease. we applied a multiarray approach including allelic variations in genes that could be involved in the pathogenesis of als disease since it has been demonstrated that inflammation, cellular adhesion, and lipid pathways are linked to such a disease  <cit> . on the contrary, it has never been demonstrated that regulation of blood pressure, coagulation, homocysteine metabolism and matrix integrity pathways are directly linked to als even though they could be indirectly.

genotyping of als cases and controls was performed. we applied advanced intelligent systems based on novel coupling of artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms and compared the results with those obtained by linear discriminant analysis and a simple back propagation approach.

surprisingly, we discovered a novel strong genetic background allowing a correct classification of cases and controls with a higher than 90% accuracy.

methods
subjects
the study population included subjects of caucasian origin belonging to italian ancestry and consisted of  <dig> sporadic als  patients and  <dig> control subjects.

diagnostic criteria for als disease were based on the world federation of neurology el escorial revisited document  <cit> . all patients diagnosed to have definite, probable or probably laboratory-supported als, who gave their informed consent, were included in the study. the diagnosis of possible als was also accepted. according to common clinical practice, our cases were subdivided into bulbar and spinal onset on the basis of the first symptoms reported by each patient. all patients, referred to the department of neurology of niguarda hospital, milan from  <dig> to  <dig>  were defined sporadic when the disease was present in a single member of the family and when no mutations were present in sod <dig> gene.

control subjects were selected from a healthy control population, randomly collected from healthy blood donors admitted to the "healthy blood donor service" of niguarda ca' granda hospital. we checked the absence of personal and familial history of als in this group through direct interview.

this study was approved by the local ethics committee.

genotyping
dna was extracted using a salting out procedures  <cit> . we applied a multilocus assay, as previously described  <cit> , to genotype  <dig> biallelic polymorphisms within  <dig> genes that were selected from pathways of lipid and homocysteine metabolism, regulation of blood pressure, coagulation, inflammation, cellular adhesion and matrix integrity. the following polymorphisms  were genotyped: lpa 93c/t,  <dig> g/a, apoa <dig> thr347ser, glu360his, apobthr71ile, apoc <dig> 641c/a, 482c/t,  <dig> t/c,  <dig> c/t,  <dig> c/g,  <dig> t/g, apoe cys112arg, arg158cys, adrb <dig> trp64arg, pparγ pro12ala, lipc 480c/t, lpl  <dig> t/g, asp9asn, asn291ser, ser447term, pon <dig> met55leu, gln192arg, pon <dig> ser311cys, ldlr ncoi+/-, cetp-631c/a, - <dig> c/a, ile405val, tnf beta thr26asn, mthfr  <dig> c/t, nos <dig> - <dig> a/g, - <dig> c/t, glu298asp, dcp <dig> ivs <dig> ins/del, agtr <dig> 1166a/c, agt met235thr, nppa  <dig> g/a, nppa  <dig> t/c, add <dig> gly460trp, scnn1a trp493arg, ala663thr, gnb <dig>  <dig> c/t, adrb <dig> arg16gly, adrb <dig> gln27glu, mmp <dig>  5a/6a, fii  <dig> g/a, fv arg506gln, fvii - <dig>  <dig> bp del/ins, arg353glu, pai - <dig> g5/g <dig>   <dig> g/t, fgb - <dig> g/a, itga <dig>  <dig> g/a, itgb <dig> leu33pro, sele ser128arg, leu554phe, icam gly214arg, tnf alpha - <dig> g/a, -308g/a, - <dig> g/a, - <dig> g/a.

the marker tnf beta thr26asn is twice present in the arrays as a control for the multiplex pcr and the hybridization procedures.

all als subjects were screened for sod <dig> mutation through pcr amplification and direct sequencing according to standard procedures  <cit> .

database
each record related to a known clinical condition or to a sample population, and comprised  <dig> variables corresponding to the  <dig> snps plus case and control. we eliminated from the database those markers for which only one genotype was present  a and  <dig> t ins) both in cases and controls. all the analysed polymorphisms may have three genotype classes: wild type, heterozygous and homozygous status. the association of these variables with als status was tested by anns and the results were compared with those obtained by a linear discriminant analysis. the models we used aimed at correct classification of the subjects in two classes:

1) sals patients ,

2) healthy subjects .

no other specific genetic model potentially linked to the analysed snp was evaluated; anns are able to build a model with a strong genetic basis just collecting all the information included within the snp without any a priori definition. the mathematical approach of anns consists in measuring the general dependence of random variables related to a group of subject without making any assumption about the nature of their underlying relationships.

artificial neural networks analysis
in this study we applied supervised anns, in order to develop a model able to predict with high degree of accuracy the diagnostic class starting from genotype data alone.

supervised anns are networks which learn by examples, calculating an error function during the training phase and adjusting the connection strengths in order to minimize the error function. the learning constraint of the supervised anns make their own output coincide with the predefined target. the general form of these anns is: y = f, where w* constitutes the set of parameters which best approximate the function.

we employed the back propagation  anns  <cit> . this type of ann belongs to a very large family of anns, that normally uses a specific kind of law of learning named feed forward . in the ff anns the signal proceeds from the input to the output of the ann, crossing all of the nodes once only. the architecture of these networks is characterized by different layers of interconnected nodes , which processes the input signal according to a non-linear function . the fundamental equation that characterizes the activation of a single node and, therefore, the signal transfer from one layer to another is:

 xj=f 

learning, i.e. the modelling of the input-output relation represented by data, occurs through minimization of the error in output and retropropagation of this to the internal nodes, one hidden units, using the algorithm of the descending gradient in the majority of cases. in particular each weight is corrected by the formula:

 Δwji=−lcoef⋅∂ e∂ wji=lcoef⋅ej⋅xi 

where for the retropropagated error ej we have:

 ej=f'⋅ 

for the last layer and:

 ej=f'⋅∑k 

for all the other layers.

in theory, a back propagation having a sufficient number of hidden units is able to reconstruct any y = f function.

the bp used in this work was intentionally improved through the use of the softmax equation, specific for classification problems  <cit> :

 yk=eik∑l=1keil 

and through the use of the selfmomentum equation  <cit>  which appears as follows:

 Δwji=lcoef⋅ej⋅xi+selfmomentumji 

 selfmomentumji=|ej|⋅ <dig> +|wji|Δwji 

where the learning cycle is indicated by n.

from a practical point of view, the selfmomentum equation allows the solution of all of the problems solved by the momentum, in a much faster way, maintaining the unitary learning coefficient .

the architecture of ann bp-ff is an input layer according to the number of selected variables, one hidden layer according to the different input layer . the output layer consisting in one of two prediction targets .

we employed as benchmark linear discriminant analysis  applied on the same training and testing data sets used for anns. for the analysis of lda, the sas version  <dig>   using forward stepwise procedure was employed.

preprocessing methods and experimental protocols
data preprocessing was performed using two different re-sampling criteria of the global dataset.

- random criterion
we employed the so-called  <dig> ×  <dig> cross-validation protocol  <cit> . in this procedure the study sample is five-times randomly divided into two sub-samples, always different but containing similar distribution of cases and controls: the training one  and the testing one. during the training phase the anns learn a model of data distribution and then, on the basis of such a model, classify subjects in the testing set in a blind way. training and testing sets are then reversed and consequently  <dig> analyses for every model employed are conducted.

-optimized criterion: twist system
the twist system is an ensemble of two algorithms: "training and testing"  and "imput selection"  algorithm  <cit> .

the t&t system is a robust data resampling technique that is able to arrange the source sample into sub-samples that all possess a similar probability density function. in this way, the data is split into two or more sub-samples in order to train, test and validate the ann models more effectively. the t&t is based on a population of n anns managed by an evolutionary system. in its simplest form, this algorithm reproduces several distribution models of the complete dataset dΓ  in two subsets . during the learning process each ann, according to its own data distribution model, is trained on the subsample dΓ and blind-validated on the subsample dΓ.

the performance score reached by each ann in the testing phase represents its "fitness" value . the genome of each "network-individual" thus codifies a data distribution model with an associated validation strategy. the n data distribution models are combined according to their fitness criteria using an evolutionary algorithm. the selection of "network-individuals" based on fitness determines the evolution of the population; that is, the progressive improvement of performance of each network until the optimal performance is reached, which is equivalent to the better division of the global dataset into subsets. the evolutionary algorithm mastering this process, named "genetic doping algorithm"   has similar characteristics to a genetic algorithm but it's able to maintain an inner instability during the evolution, carrying out a natural increase of biodiversity and a continuous "evolution of the evolution" in the population. the elaboration of t&t is articulated in two phases:

- preliminary phase: in this phase an evaluation of the parameters of the fitness function that will be used on the global dataset is performed. during this phase an inductor ΩdΓ,a,f,z is configured, which consists of an ann with an algorithm  back propagation standard. for this inductor the optimal configuration to reach the convergence is stabilized at the end of different training trials on the global dataset dΓ; in this way the configuration that most "suits" the available dataset is determined: the number of layers and hidden units and some possible generalizations of the standard learning law. the parameters thus determined define the configuration and the initialization of all the individual-networks of the population and will then stay fixed in the following computational phase. basically, during this preliminary phase there is a fine-tuning of the inductor that defines the fitness values of the population's individuals during evolution.

the accuracy of the ann performance with the testing set will be the fitness of that individual .

- computational phase: the system extracts from the global dataset the best training and testing sets. during this phase the individual-network of the population is running, according to the established configuration and the initialization parameters. from the evolution of the population, managed by the gend algorithm, the best distribution of the global dataset d Γ into two subsets is generated, starting from the initial population of possible solutions x=. preliminary experimental sessions are performed using several different initialization and configuration of the network in order to achieve the best partition of the global dataset.

parallel to t&t runs i.s. the is system is an adaptive system, which is also based on the evolutionary algorithm gend, and which is able to evaluate the relevance of the different variables of the dataset in an intelligent way. therefore it can be considered on the same level as a feature selection technique. from a formal point of view, i.s. is an artificial organism based on the gend algorithm and consists of a population of ann, in which each one carries out a selection of the independent variables on the available database. the elaboration of i.s., as for t&t, is developed in two phases:

- preliminary phase: during this phase an inductor ΩdΓ,a,f,z is configured to evaluate the parameters of the fitness function. this inductor is a standard back-propagation ann. the parameters configuration and the initialization of the anns are carried out with particular care to avoid possible over-fitting problems that can be present when the database is characterized by a high number of variables that describe a low quantity of data. the number of epochs e <dig> necessary to train the inductor is determined through preliminary experimental tests.

- computational phase: the inductor is active, according to the stabilized configuration and the fixed initialization parameters, to extract the most relevant variables of the training and testing subsets. each individual-network of the population is trained on the training set d'Γ and tested on the testing set d'Γ.

the evolution of the individual-network of the population is based on the algorithm gend. in the i.s. approach the gend genome is built by n binary values, where n is the cardinality of the original input space. every gene indicates if an input variable is to be used or not during the evaluation of the population fitness. through the evolutionary algorithm, the different "hypotheses" of variable selection, generated by each anns of the population, change over time, at each generation: this leads to the selection of the best combination of input variables. as in the t&t systems the genetic operators crossover and mutation are applied on the anns population; the rates of occurrence for both operators are self-determinated by the system in adaptive way at each generation.

when the evolutionary algorithm no longer improves its performance, the process stops, and the best selection of the input variables is employed on the testing subset.

in order to improve the speed and the quality of the solutions that have to be optimized, the gend algorithm makes the evolutionary process of the artificial populations more natural and less centered on the individual liberalism culture.

the combined action of t&t and i.s. systems allow us to solve two frequent problems in managing anns. both systems are based on a genetic algorithm, the genetic doping algorithm  developed at semeion research centre  <cit> .

gend was provided with  <dig> individuals, generated randomly. each individual represents a possible distribution of the whole dataset into two subsets. two independent multilayers perceptrons  with  <dig> hidden units, are trained for  <dig> epochs and tested in blinded manner on the two subsets. a function of the testing results of the two independent mlps defines the fitness of each individual.

a crossover function is applied on the populations of  <dig> individuals and new individuals are generated. a mutation operator is applied to the new individuals and to the individuals whose fitness is weakest. in the gend algorithm the rate of crossover and the rate of mutation are self-determined by the system in adaptive way at each generation. this loop is applied for at least  <dig> generations, or stopped when the system does not show any significant improvement at least from  <dig> generations. the individual whose distribution of the whole dataset into two subsets is the best one from the blind testing results is saved and then used as optimal distribution to train and test more sophisticated anns.

we implemented both algorithms in c language and we used a pentium iii cpu to run the system on real data. around  <dig> hours were spent for each run. we remind that t&t and i.s. algorithms have to be used only once to train the system. once trained, the system can answer on line to any new pattern.

after this processing, the features that were most significant for the classification were selected and at the same time the training set and the testing set were created with a function of probability distribution similar to the one that provided the best results in the classification.

a supervised multi layer perceptron, with four hidden units, was then used for the classification task.

RESULTS
study populations
we collected  <dig> patients :  <dig> males  and  <dig> females  with a male/female ratio  <dig> : <dig>  the site of clinical onset was spinal in  <dig> %  and bulbar in  <dig> %  of cases. the mean disease duration at the time of observation was  <dig>  years . the frequency of bulbar onset in females  resulted greater than in males .

all patients were previously screened for sod <dig> gene mutation by sequence analysis and no genetic variations were found.

control subjects were  <dig> males and  <dig> females; age range  <dig> to  <dig> years, .

genotyping analysis
deviations of the genotype frequencies from the hardy-weinberg equilibrium were tested in the control group with chi-squared statistics . allele frequencies at each marker locus were calculated from the genotype frequencies of the control group under the null hypothesis of hardy-weinberg equilibrium. allele frequencies at each marker locus are reported.

classification performances with anns
results obtained with linear discriminant analysis were compared with those obtained with a simple back propagation approach .

the second and third columns report the percentage of patients correctly classified as belonging to cases or controls. the fourth and fifth columns report the accuracy obtained by the model as arithmetic mean and weighted mean. the number of errors is reported in the last column. the last row reports the mean values of all the columns.

the second and third columns report the percentage of patients correctly classified as belonging to cases or controls. the fourth and fifth columns report the accuracy obtained by the model as arithmetic mean and weighted mean. the number of errors is reported in the last column. the last row reports the mean values of all the columns.

in these experiments we applied the random criterion to divide the dataset five times in training and testing sub-sets applying the  <dig> ×  <dig> cross validation protocol.

the predictive accuracy obtained with linear discriminant analysis and standard artificial neural networks ranged from 70% to 79%  and from  <dig>  to  <dig> %  respectively.

with the twist approach, every experiment was conducted in a blind and independent manner in two directions: training with sub-sample a and blind testing with sub-sample b vs training with sub-sample b and blind testing with sub-sample a. the results from the best five applications of twist procedures are reported in table  <dig>  this advanced intelligent system, through the final selection of a subgroup of 25– <dig> variables along ten independent applications, provided the highest predictive performance with a sensitivity ranging from  <dig> % to 100% , and a specificity ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  and with an overall accuracy ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . in all the twist system experiments the 90% overall accuracy threshold was exceeded whereas back propagation and linear discriminant analysis never exceeded the 80% threshold.

in the first column ab means training on subset a and testing on subset b; ba means the opposite. the second and third columns report the percentage of patients correctly classified as belonging to cases or controls. the fourth and fifth columns report the accuracy obtained by the model as arithmetic mean and weighted mean. the number of errors is reported in the last column. the last row reports the mean values of all the columns.

genetic variants selected by the five twist procedures
seven genetic variants were always independently selected by the five twist procedures: apolipoprotein e   arg158cys; hepatic lipase   - <dig> c/t; endothelial nitric oxide synthase    <dig> c/t and glu298asp; vitamin k-dependent coagulation factor seven   arg353glu, glycoprotein ia/iia    <dig> g/a; e-selectin   ser128arg.

the second and third columns report the percentage of patients correctly classified as belonging to cases or controls. the fourth and fifth columns report the accuracy obtained by the model as arithmetic mean and weighted mean. the number of errors is reported in the last column. the last row reports the mean values of all the columns.

genetic variants independently selected by four twist procedures
the number of genetic variants selected four times over five experiments consisted of: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma  pro12ala , lipoprotein lipase  asp9asn , paraoxonase  <dig>  met55leu and paraoxonase  <dig>  ser311cys , tumor necrosis factor beta  thr <dig> asn , methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase   <dig> c/t , angiotensin ii receptor type <dig>   <dig> a/c , atrial natriuretic peptide   <dig> g/a , epithelial na channel subunit  trp493arg, , fvii - <dig> ins/del, sele leu554phe, tumor necrosis factor alpha  - <dig> g/a and - <dig> g/a .

the tnf beta thr26asn was used as further control. first it was selected by four twist systems and later, since the information linked to such a variation was already recruited, none of the twist systems selected this snp.

genetic variants never selected by any twist procedures
the following gene/genetic variants were never selected by the five twist procedures: apolipoprotein a <dig>   thr347ser; apolipoprotein c <dig>   - <dig> c/a and  <dig> c/t; beta  <dig> adrenergic receptor  trp64arg ; lpl ser447term; pon <dig> gln192arg; low density lipoprotein receptor   exon  <dig> ncoi +/-; cholesteryl ester transfer protein  - <dig> c/a and - <dig> c/a ; nos <dig>  <dig> a/g; g-protein beta  <dig> subunit   <dig> c/t ; beta  <dig> adrenergic receptor  arg16gly ; beta fibrinogen  - <dig> g/a ; tnf alfa - <dig> g/a and tnf beta thr26asn.

discussion
the mechanism of neurodegeneration in als remains an enigma. the major problem is that little is known about the disease mechanism, making candidate gene selection difficult and haphazard. it follows that an unconventional approach of making no a priori assumptions about the location of the variants of interest might be appropriate, provided that a similarly unconventional statistical approach is available to manage the data complexity.

comparison of results obtained using three different analytical approaches , points out the need to employ systems that are really able of handling the disease complexity instead of treating the data with reductionist approaches unable to detect multiple genes of smaller effect in predisposing to the disease. the possibility of obtaining high diagnostic accuracy from limited and selected genetic information using these new analytical tools, shows that even in so-called sporadic als the genetic background plays a fundamental role.

another important obstacle in approaching the molecular basis of a rare disease like als in a conventional manner, is related to the difficulty of finding a homogeneous sample population large enough to be analysed for a wide number of genetic variants. artificial neural networks, at variance with the classical statistical tests, can manage complexity even with relatively small samples and the subsequent unbalanced ratio between variables and records. in this connection, it is important to note that adaptive learning algorithms of inference, based on the principle of a functional estimation like artificial neural networks, overcome the problem of dimensionality.

internal validation of the prediction accuracy is one of the most important problems in neural networks analysis. in fact, the restriction of training procedures to only a part of the dataset, generally half of it, causes a potential loss of power to recognize hidden patterns. in this study optimization of the training and testing procedures were addressed using the evolutionary training and testing algorithm, which ensured that the two halves of the dataset contained the same amount of relevant information. thus, the best division of the whole dataset into a training and a testing set was reached after a finite number of generations. finally anns were able to identify gene combinations  that are likely to produce accurate predictions of als for a single individual, regardless of some possible limitations such as male/female ratio and age differences among the case and control groups. this study enrolled more than  <dig> medical cases with an accurate diagnosis of als and we were able to test them for  <dig> snps in  <dig> genes. although the sals patients analyzed represent a small cohort, it is nevertheless really representative from an epidemiological point of view .

besides, all als patients were previously screened for sod <dig> gene mutations with negative results, thus confirming the sporadic nature of the disease. however, the sample size of  <dig> cases analysed for more than  <dig> snps, prompted us to look for valid, powerful and efficient statistical tools to approach and evaluate our data.

on the basis of the observed results some information related to the methodological approaches used can be assumed. the multiarray approach was previously validated by ourselves  <cit>  and others  <cit>  and contains tnf beta as the internal control.

indeed, apoe arg158cys was selected by all the five twists while the apoe cys112arg was selected only once. for nos variants, the position - <dig> in the promoter region was never selected while the - <dig> variant in the promoter region too and the non synonymous variant in position  <dig> were both selected by all the five twists. the two factor vii and selectin  genetic variants both containing the information necessary for the correct attribution to the disease vs healthy status, were selected five times  and four times , respectively. the role of the paroxonase in predisposing to als disease appears to be confirmed: pon <dig> met 55leu and pon <dig> ser311cys were chosen four times, whereas pon <dig> gln192arg was never. pparγ pro12ala was chosen four times: we can assume a generic role of this receptor on als disease since pparγ is at the crossroads between lipid metabolism and innate immune response  <cit> . in addition, we noticed, for example, that in the same tnf locus, 6p <dig> , lies also the hfe gene for hemocromatosis and the peripherin gene, both previously involved in als disease  <cit> .

few genetic variants were never selected by any of the twist procedures. one possible reason is that some information had already been picked up by the systems, e.g. for pon <dig>  nos and tnf. moreover, regarding apoa <dig> and apo c <dig> variants we observed that they lie on chromosome  <dig> which may not be at all involved in the disease. indeed, a very recent paper on genome wide genotyping in als  <cit> , found no snps associated with the disease on chromosome  <dig> 

from a biological point of view, the identified gene variations confirm some of the already known results  and identify new gene/genetic variations not known to be involved in the disease. our results strengthen the involvement of oxidative stress as well as angiogenesis  and immune response  pathways. besides, our results shed light on the involvement of lipid pathways . indeed, a role for polyunsaturated fatty acids has been postulated for the misfolding protein aggregations in several neurodegenerative diseases including familial als  <cit> . furthermore polyunsaturated fatty acids could be enzymatically converted into various lipid mediators such as leukotriene and prostaglandins which have a strong biological activity in several signalling pathways  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study has a major focus on disentangling the effect of interacting multiple low penetrance alleles on complex diseases. we analysed genetic variables within genes possibly involved in the als disease and thanks to artificial intelligence agents such as those employed in this study, on the basis of a subset of genetic data only, we were are able to conveniently differentiate als cases from control subjects. we still do not know which specific variation within the subset of snp is linked to the disease, however anns are able to discriminate among cases and controls with only seven genetic snps.

we are aware that this is an exploratory study and that it should be replicated in another and much larger sample size, nevertheless this study offers new insight into genetic markers of sporadic als pointing out the existence of a strong genetic background. the data provide useful information to direct future research on the complexity of the genetic profile of als subjects.
