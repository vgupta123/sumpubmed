BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen that is ubiquitously present among swine populations in the pig industry. thirty-three capsular serotypes have been described to date  <cit>  of which serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are frequently isolated from diseased pigs in europe  <cit> . strain virulence differs between serotypes and even within a serotype: virulent, avirulent and weakly virulent isolates have been isolated based on the expression of virulence markers, muramidase released protein  and extracellular factor   <cit>  and suilysin  <cit> .

nasopharyngeal carriage of s. suis in adult pigs is asymptomatic, whereas in young piglets this increases susceptibility to s. suis invasive disease, leading to meningitis, arthritis and serositis, and high rates of mortality  <cit> . in western countries humans occupationally exposed to pigs or uncooked pork might also become infected by s. suis although the incidence is very low  <cit> . invasive s. suis infection of humans gives similar clinical signs as in pigs; patients often suffer from remaining deafness after recovery  <cit> . in southeast asia however, s. suis is considered an emerging pathogen for humans, and is recognized as leading cause of bacterial meningitis  <cit> . in southeast asia, clinical signs of human infections with s. suis are reported to be more severe compared to other parts of the world, with patients developing toxic shock-like syndrome, sepsis and meningitis  <cit> .

previously, a hypervirulent s. suis isolate  was generated that causes severe toxic shock-like syndrome in piglets after infection resulting in death within 24 h post-infection  <cit> . s735-pcom1-v <cit>  was selected from a library of clones generated in a weakly virulent serotype  <dig> isolate , after transformation with plasmid dna isolated from around  <dig>  pooled clones carrying randomly cloned genomic dna fragments from a virulent serotype  <dig> isolate . isolates with increased virulence were selected by infecting piglets with strain s <dig> containing the plasmid library of genomic fragments from strain  <dig>  one prevalent clone isolated from the infected piglets contained a 3 kb genomic fragment from strain  <dig> designated v <cit>  and was demonstrated to be hypervirulent in subsequent animal experiments. v <cit>  contained an incomplete open reading frame , followed by two genes  in an operon structure as well as a second incomplete orf  <cit> . assuming that only the full-length orfs could contribute to the hypervirulence of this isolate, we further characterized the orf2-folc-operon. the first orf in the operon could not be annotated and was designated orf <dig>  the second orf in the operon showed homology to polyfolylpolyglutamate synthase   <cit> . this operon was present in all s. suis serotypes, including the parent strain s <dig>  strain s <dig> with low virulence, contained several single nucleotide polymorphisms  in orf2-folc and the non-coding regions compared to strain  <dig>  <cit> .

in this study, we aimed to explain the increased virulence of the strain containing the orf2-folc operon. we demonstrate that overexpression of orf <dig> suffices to increase the virulence, and that a snp in the predicted − <dig> region upstream of the promoter of the operon is strongly associated with virulence in s. suis isolates. furthermore, the stronger promoter was shown to be present in all virulent or highly virulent s. suis isolates that were included in our study, highlighting a correlation between high orf <dig> expression and virulence.

RESULTS
overexpression of orf <dig> increases virulence of strain s735
introduction of a 3 kb genomic fragment from virulent serotype  <dig> strain  <dig> increased the virulence of the weakly virulent serotype  <dig> strain s <dig>  <cit> , creating a hypervirulent isolate . all pigs infected with s735-pcom1-v <cit>  died within 1 day post infection  and a high percentage of the pigs showed severe clinical signs of disease , whereas nearly all pigs infected with the control strain s735-pcom <dig> survived throughout the experiment. clinical indices differed significantly  between pigs infected with s735-pcom1-v <cit>  and s735-pcom <dig> . as a control we also tested the virulence of s <dig> transformed with a plasmid containing the homologous 3 kb fragment from strain s <dig> . a high percentage of the pigs infected with s735-pcom1-v survived throughout the experiment. in contrast pigs infected with s735-pcom1-v showed significantly more specific clinical signs  than pigs infected with s735-pcom <dig> , although differences in clinical indices for fever and non-specific symptoms were not significantly different between the groups . thus the increased copy number of v in s <dig>  due to introduction of plasmid pcom1-v increased specific clinical signs of s. suis. nevertheless, the specific and non-specific clinical signs due to porcine infection with s735-pcom1-v <cit>   were significantly increased compared to pigs infected with s735-pcom1-v, demonstrating that the introduction of v <cit>  in strain s <dig> increased the virulence more than introduction of v. this result indicated that hypervirulence of strain s <dig> pcom-1-v <cit>  might be due to the different nucleotide polymorphisms in v <cit>  compared to v.table  <dig>

to determine whether v <cit>  alone could increase the virulence of an otherwise avirulent s. suis strain, pcom1-v <cit>  was introduced into the avirulent serotype  <dig> strain t <dig> to generate strain t <dig> pcom1-v <cit> . all piglets infected with t15-pcom1-v <cit>  survived throughout the experiment , some piglets did show mild clinical signs including fever and specific symptoms . although wild-type isolate t <dig> was not included into this study, clinical signs or fever have not been previously reported in piglets intranasally infected with this avirulent serotype  <dig> isolate  <cit> . based on this results we tentatively concluded that the introduction of pcom1-v <cit>  might increase the virulence of strain t <dig> slightly, although the effect was smaller than that observed in strain s <dig>  and could also be due to intravenous inoculation. obviously, the genetic background of a strain determines whether introduction of v <cit>  suffices to increase the virulence tremendously.

to determine if the complete orf2-folc-operon was required for the observed increase in virulence, both genes of the operon from strain  <dig> and its cognate promoter were introduced separately into strain s <dig> to generate strains s735-pcom1-orf <dig> <cit>  and s735-pcom1-folc <cit> . virulence of these isolates was determined in an experimental infection in piglets, using s735-pcom1-v <cit>  and s735-pcom <dig> as controls. table  <dig> shows that pigs infected with s735-pcom1-v <cit>  or with s735-pcom1-orf <dig> <cit>  died within one day p.i. with severe clinical signs. infected pigs developed toxic shock-like syndrome that was not observed using wild-type strain  <dig> in experimental infections, implying fragments v <cit>  and orf <dig> <cit>  increased virulence of s <dig> yielding more virulent isolates than strain  <dig>  <cit> . both specific and non-specific symptoms were significantly increased  in pigs infected with s735-pcom1-v <cit>  or with s735-pcom1-orf <dig> <cit>  compared to s735-pcom <dig> . bacteriological examination showed that cns, serosae and joints were colonized by high cfu of s. suis. in contrast pigs infected with s735-pcom1-folc <cit>  or s735-pcom <dig> lived throughout the experiment  showing mild symptoms of infection, like fever. no significant differences in clinical outcome were observed between pigs infected with s735-pcom1-folc <cit>  and with s735-pcom <dig>  this clearly demonstrates that introduction of folc <cit>  does not increase the virulence of strain s <dig>  whereas introduction of v <cit>  and orf <dig> <cit>  increased the virulence of strain s <dig>  therefore, we concluded that the observed increased virulence of s735-pcom1-v <cit>  compared to s735-pcom <dig> was attributed to introduction of orf <dig> <cit> .

innate immune response of porcine pbmcs
as clinical signs of s. suis strains s735-pcom1-v <cit>  and s735-pcom1-orf <dig> <cit>  were severe, it was hypothesized that introduction of orf <dig> might exacerbate the innate inflammatory response to s. suis contributing to the host pathology and symptoms. to test this hypothesis, immune responses of porcine pbmcs to s735-pcom1-orf <dig> <cit>  and s735-pcom <dig> were compared in vitro. gene expression levels of innate immune genes of pbmcs were determined after incubation with s. suis isolates as a function of time  using qpcr. both s735-pcom <dig> and s735-pcom1-orf <dig> <cit>  induced high gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine il-1-β  and chemokine il- <dig>  compared to controls whereas relatively low gene expression of pro-inflammatory il- <dig> , anti-inflammatory il- <dig> , and tnf-α  and ifn-γ  was induced by both isolates . the transcript levels peaked at 4 h p.i. for all genes tested except for il- <dig> which was not expressed in response to s. suis during the incubation time of our experiment . there were no significant differences between the two isolates in the expression levels of any of the tested immune genes. these data suggest that the observed increased virulence of s735-pcom1-orf <dig> <cit>  in piglets compared to s735-pcom <dig> is probably not due to differences in the host innate responses to this strain.figure  <dig>

a promoter snp leads to differential expression of the orf2/folc operon
sequence analysis of the putative promoter of orf <dig> revealed a difference at one nucleotide position in the − <dig> region of the putative promoter in strain  <dig>  compared to strain s <dig>   <cit> . the effect of this snp on expression levels of orf <dig> and folc in strains  <dig> and s <dig> was determined using qpcr analysis. significantly higher levels of expression of orf <dig> as well as folc were observed in strain  <dig> compared to strain s <dig> . this clearly indicates that the snp in the − <dig> region of the putative promoter affects the transcription of orf <dig> and folc. thereby, it demonstrates that the identified snp was indeed located in the promoter region co-transcribing orf <dig> and folc in an operon. moreover, introduction of pcom1-orf <dig> <cit>  into s <dig> increased expression of orf <dig> 31-fold compared to introduction of pcom <dig>  whereas introduction of pcom1-orf <dig> increased expression of orf <dig> only 5-fold . as expected expression levels of folc were similar for both recombinant strains . to confirm that the identified snp in the − <dig> region of the promoter is responsible for the differences in transcription of orf <dig> in strains s <dig> and  <dig> the tggtca of orf <dig> was mutated to tggaca as found in the promoter of orf <dig> <cit>  . both promoters are most active early in the growth phase of s. suis when grown in todd hewitt broth . together, these results clearly demonstrate that in strain  <dig>  the promoter upstream of orf2-folc-operon is stronger than the promoter upstream of this operon in strain s <dig>  due to an snp in the − <dig> region.figure  <dig>

sequence analysis of the- <dig> region of the orf2/folc promoter and orf <dig> sequence in different strains and serotypes of s. suis
to determine whether the snp linked to increased expression of orf2-folc operon was associated with particular clonal types or serotypes of s. suis the promoter regions of a large collection of isolates were sequenced . all isolates used were recently characterized and typed by cgh and mlst  <cit> . based on the sequence data obtained, isolates could be divided in two main groups . the strong − <dig> promoter region was exclusively found in serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates that belonged to cgh cluster a and mlst clonal complex  <dig> and that expressed the ef-protein. the snp associated with lower promoter activity was found in serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates belonging to cgh group b , which are all negative for the expression of ef, as well as in weakly virulent isolates of serotype  <dig> belonging to cgh group a/clonal complex  <dig>  that were positive for the expression of the larger form of ef protein . there were two exceptions; serotype  <dig> isolate , that belongs to cc <dig> but does not express the ef-protein contained the snp linked to higher promoter activity and serotype  <dig> isolate  which had a different − <dig> promoter sequence  for which the promoter strength is undetermined. in conclusion, only cc <dig> isolates expressing ef protein  contain the snp linked to strong promoter activity. as isolates of this combination of phenotype and genotype are strongly correlated with virulence  <cit> , upstream of orf2-folc-operon is associated with virulent isolates of s. suis.table  <dig>

besides the correlation between promoter strength and virulence, we also looked for an association between amino acid sequence of orf <dig> and virulence. sequence analysis of the orf2-folc-operon of wild type strains  <dig> and s <dig> revealed several snps throughout the sequence  <cit> . a comparison of orf <dig> protein sequences in different isolates revealed more heterogeneity. however, orf <dig> protein sequence of all serotype  <dig> mrp+ef+ isolates were identical to the sequence of orf <dig> in strain  <dig>  besides some variation in the predicted start site of the proteins. clustering of protein sequences revealed three groups of orf <dig> sequences, indicated with cluster  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in figure  <dig>  within cluster  <dig>  two subclusters could be identified: cluster 1a and 1b. cluster 1a contained strains with an orf <dig> sequence that was identical to strain 10; these isolates seem to be associated with virulence. all of the characterized isolates within cluster 1a belong to cc <dig> and express ef protein. furthermore, all isolates containing the stronger promoter belonged to this group. cluster 1b contained two isolates, a chinese serotype  <dig> isolate and a serotype  <dig> mrp−ef− isolate , with respectively one and two amino acid substitutions in orf <dig> compared to orf <dig> of strain  <dig>  the observation that 89– <dig> clusters with a serotype  <dig> isolate, instead of with the other serotype  <dig> mrp−ef− isolates, adds to the speculation that strain 89– <dig> is more similar to serotype  <dig> isolates than to other mrp−ef− isolates as was also suggested in our cgh study  <cit> . within cluster  <dig>  three subclusters could be identified: cluster 2b contained avirulent serotype  <dig> isolates that were mrp−ef−, cluster 2c contained weakly virulent mrp+ef− isolates including s <dig>  and cluster 2a contained  <dig> serotype  <dig> isolate with unknown virulence. within these subclusters amino acid sequences are identical, the subclusters differ at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino acid positions compared to strain  <dig>  cluster  <dig> contained serotype  <dig> isolates from different geographical locations, including the reference strain  <dig>  in conclusion, isolates that are associated with virulence have a strong promoter and an identical protein sequence of orf <dig>  whereas less virulent isolates have a weaker promoter and a different protein sequence. the relevance of the heterogenic amino acid composition of orf <dig> is unknown, it could interfere with function or folding of orf <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study we showed that introduction of the orf2-gene  of the orf2-folc-operon from strain  <dig> increased the virulence of weakly virulent strain s <dig>  thereby creating a hypervirulent isolate. the increased virulence of s735-pcom1-v <cit>  was shown to be correlated with increased expression of orf <dig> due to the presence of a stronger promoter in strain  <dig> compared to strain s <dig>  the promoter of the orf2-folc-operon differed at single nucleotide position close to the predicted − <dig> region, implicating that one snp at a crucial position can increase the virulence of s. suis tremendously. the stronger promoter was only present in serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates belonging to mlst clonal complex  <dig> that express ef protein, suggesting an association between the strong promoter  and virulence.

introduction of heterologous orf <dig> <cit>  into weakly virulent s. suis strain s <dig> and subsequent infection of pigs with this strain resulted in unusually rapid development of toxic shock-like syndrome and severe clinical signs within 1 day p.i , which resulted in the pigs being euthanized for ethical reasons. introduction of the homologous fragment containing the intact operon from strain s <dig> also increased the virulence of the resulting isolate s735-pcom1-v significantly compared to the control isolate s735-pcom <dig> but the virulence was significantly less that than that of strain s <dig> pcom1-v <cit> . the virulence of the isolates was correlated with gene expression level of orf <dig>  the − <dig> sequence of the promoter region of the folc-orf2-operon in strain  <dig>  deviated from the σ <dig> consensus promoter  at  <dig> position, and induced higher expression of both orf <dig> and folc than the − <dig> sequence of the promoter region of the folc-orf2-operon in strain s <dig>  that deviates from the σ <dig> consensus at  <dig> positions. introduction of homologous v preceded by the weaker s <dig> promoter into strain s <dig>  increased the expression level of orf <dig>  <dig> fold and significantly increased the virulence of the isolate compared to the control s735-pcom <dig>  hypervirulence, however, is only achieved when multiple copies of either v <cit>  or orf <dig> <cit>  both preceded by the stronger promoter were present in strain s <dig> this demonstrates that increase of heterologous or homologous expression of orf <dig> in strain s <dig>  increased the virulence of s <dig>  a similar effect has been observed for the suilysin gene , where  <dig> snps in the promoter region of sly were detected, and suggested to be associated with more virulent isolates  <cit> . in s. suis a slight increase of virulence occurred after introducing v <cit>  into avirulent strain t <dig> although the effect was less pronounced than in strain s <dig>  this suggests that increased heterologous orf <dig> <cit>  expression in strain t <dig> might increase the virulence, but the completely different genetic background of strain t <dig>  <cit>  probably prohibited a more pronounced increase of virulence of this strain. in conclusion, increased heterologous or homologous expression of orf <dig> in either strain s <dig> or strain t <dig> was correlated with increased virulence.

unfortunately, orf <dig> did not show homology to any known sequences in the database, so it was not possible to predict the function of orf <dig>  and its role in s. suis pathogenesis. based on hydrophobicity plots  <cit> , orf <dig> was predicted to be localized in the membrane, and could therefore interact with the host during infection. the host innate response to the hypervirulent isolate was studied in vitro in pbmcs. a strong pro-inflammatory immune response was induced in pbmcs that peaked 4 h p.i. both after incubation with the hypervirulent isolate as well as with the control isolate . similar pro-inflammatory host responses to s. suis were described for alveolar macrophages  <cit> , brain microvascular cells  <cit> , monocytes  <cit>  and choroid plexus cells  <cit> , suggesting the hypervirulent isolate induced a similar innate response to other s. suis isolates in vitro. this observation needs to be confirmed in vivo.

in post-mortem bacteriology of piglets infected with the hypervirulent isolate, the organs were found to be colonized by extremely large numbers of s. suis. this result suggests the hypervirulent isolate can multiply very fast in vivo, whereas in vitro the hypervirulent isolate s735-pcom1-orf <dig> <cit>  showed a slightly decreased growth rate compared to s735-pcom <dig> . it could have been expected that the high numbers of bacteria present within 24 h in organs of pigs infected with s735-pcom1-orf <dig> <cit> , resulted in a strong proinflammatory responses, that could ultimately result in the observed toxic shock-like syndrome. however, as in vitro measurements did not show any differences in host responses between s735-pcom1-orf <dig> <cit>  and s735-pcom <dig> , it is more likely that introduction of orf <dig> into strain s <dig> is responsible for rapid growth and/or spreading of the bacteria in the host, and is not directly involved in a changed host response. this suggestion could be further substantiated by the in vitro expression studies that showed that orf <dig> expression is highest in the early exponential growth phase. although the in vitro kinetics of gene expression do not necessarily reflect the in vivo kinetics, it is plausible that orf <dig> expression is regulated under in vivo conditions as well. this would suggest that the advantage of introduction of orf <dig> into strain s <dig> is inducible during the infection process, leading to more efficient breaking of host defence barriers, or to an increased growth rate as was already suggested by the large bacterial load. recently, a gene homologous to ssu <dig> was annotated as folate transporter folt in s. suis strain sc <dig>  this suggests that the whole v <cit>  operon is involved in folate metabolism. it is known that folate is essential for all living organism including bacteria. our results would suggest that overexpression of genes involved in folate metabolism would be beneficial for growth and virulence in vivo.

in this study, we demonstrated that the stronger promoter was present in all virulent or highly virulent s. suis isolates that expressed ef protein that were included in our study, highlighting a correlation between high orf <dig> expression and virulence. conversely, the weaker promoter was present in isolates known to be weakly pathogenic or non-pathogenic. there were some exceptions. a serotype  <dig> isolate  was shown to have a different promoter that deviated from the σ <dig> consensus promoter at one position, like the strong promoter. strength of this promoter is unknown. another serotype  <dig> isolate  contained the stronger promoter. this isolate belonged to mlst clonal complex  <dig>  that strictly contains virulent s. suis isolates  <cit>  and was isolated from the joints of a lame pig. based on these observations, it could be speculated that this isolate is more virulent than other serotype  <dig> isolates. finally, the serotype  <dig> reference strain  contained the weak promoter despite being virulent. however, this isolate was already shown not to be a good representative of serotype  <dig> isolates  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the difference in expression level of orf <dig> due to different promoter sequences could be responsible for the observed difference in virulence. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the amino acid substitutions of orf <dig> also affect function or effect of the orf <dig> proteins of s. suis strains. in conclusion, the presence of a strong promoter in the − <dig> region of the orf2-folc-operon is associated with virulence. further research on the biological function of orf <dig> may identify novel targets for vaccination or therapy of s. suis infections.
