BACKGROUND
the high-throughput genome projects have resulted in a rapid accumulation of predicted protein sequences for a large number of organisms. researchers have begun to systematically tackle protein functions and complex regulatory processes by studying organisms on a global scale, from genomes and proteomes to metabolomes and interactomes. meanwhile, structural genomics projects have generated a growing number of protein structures of unknown function. to fully realize the value of these high-throughput data requires better understanding of protein function. with experimentally-verified information on protein function lagging behind, computational methods are needed for functional prediction of proteins. in particular, knowledge of the location of catalytic residues provides valuable insight into the mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

many computational methods have been developed for predicting protein functions and functional residues involved in catalytic reactions, binding activities, and protein-protein interactions. automated propagation of functional annotation from a protein with known function to homologous proteins is a well-established method for the assignment of protein function. however, reliable functional propagation generally requires a high degree of sequence similarity. for example, to transfer all four digits of an ec number at an error rate of below 10% needs at least 60% sequence identity  <cit> , and only about 60% of the proteins can be annotated by a homology transfer of experimental functional information in  <dig> proteomes  <cit> .

the evolutionary trace  method is used for prediction of active sites and functional interfaces in proteins with known structure. based on the observation that functional residues are more conserved than other residues, the method finds the most conserved residues at different sequence identity cutoffs and, as a final step, relies on human visual examination of the residues on protein structures  <cit> . while the et method was shown successful in many case studies  <cit> , the need for manual inspection in this original implementation is not suitable for automated large-scale analysis. modified and automated versions of the et method have been developed and tested on two protein datasets. in one study  <cit> , the catalytic residues were predicted correctly for  <dig>  out of  <dig> enzymes with the actsite and site records from the pdb database ; in another study  <cit> , ~60%  of catalytic residues were predicted correctly for  <dig> enzymes with experimentally characterized active sites.

another group of methods, the ab initio methods , do not use sequence conservation for functional site prediction. these methods exploit general protein properties, such as residue buffer capacity  <cit> , the electrostatic energy of charged residues  <cit> , protein subcellular localization  <cit> , and conservation of local structural similarities  <cit> . these methods are potentially useful for the prediction of novel protein functions even if sequence conservation of the functional site in question is low.

the last group of methods combines sequence conservation with different aspects of protein structure  <cit> . three-dimensional cluster analysis predicted functional residues by examination of spatially-adjacent conserved residues  <cit> , and achieved a high recovery  with low error rate  for the prediction of catalytic residues in  <dig> enzymes. a similar method enriched with two additional structural parameters predicted ~47% of catalytic residues at the 5% false positive rate among  <dig> enzymes from the cdd database with manually curated catalytic sites  <cit> . a method for locating catalytic residues based on the sequence conservation, local special conservation, stability analysis, and geometrical location of the residue predicted 56% of catalytic residues in  <dig> enzymes  <cit> . the method considered only highly conserved d, e, k, r, h, s, t, n, y, and c residues. a trained neural network  with spatial clustering predicted over 69% of catalytic residues with a high false positive rate among  <dig> enzymes from the catres database  containing manually curated catalytic residues  <cit> . the method used sequence conservation, residue type, and four structural parameters as inputs for the nn.

direct comparison of methods is confounded by the use of different performance measures and different datasets of various size and quality. nevertheless, the overall accuracy for the prediction of catalytic residues remains low . this study aimed to develop an improved fully-automated method for the prediction of catalytic residues using a carefully selected, supervised machine learning algorithm coupled with an optimal discriminative set of protein sequence conservation and structural properties.

RESULTS
selection of the best machine learning algorithm using  <dig> residue properties
to determine the best machine learning algorithm for the predictive task,  <dig> classifiers currently available in the weka software package  were compared using their default parameters and a benchmarking dataset of  <dig> enzymes with  <dig> catalytic residues. the performance of the algorithms was measured by the matthews correlation coefficients  in a 10-fold cross-validation analysis using three balanced datasets generated from the benchmarking data, each with an equal number of non-catalytic residues randomly chosen from all non-catalytic residues of the benchmarking dataset. each residue was represented by a set of  <dig> sequence and structural attributes and a label of {+1/-1} to indicate whether the residue is catalytic  or not .

the best-performing algorithm was the sequential minimal optimization  algorithm , which is a support vector machine   <cit> . the svm is a learning machine for two-group classification problems that transforms the attribute space into multidimensional feature space using a kernel function to separate dataset instances by an optimal hyperplane  <cit> . the next three top algorithms are simple logistic/lmt, logistic, and decision table, all containing automatic attribute selection for optimal performance.

selection of an optimal subset of residue properties for the smo algorithm
as svm is sensitive to the presence of irrelevant attributes, proper attribute selection may further increase the accuracy of the smo algorithm. although relevant protein features for the prediction of catalytic residues are known, an optimal discriminative set of protein sequence conservation and structural properties has not been reported. to select an optimal subset of residue properties, we first analyzed how individual attributes from the initial set of  <dig> properties contributed to predictive accuracy. while the predictive accuracy with the combination of all  <dig> attributes reached 86%, the predictive potential of most individual attributes was significantly lower, many in the 50–60% ranges . the top five attributes all have to do with sequence conservation  or amino acid identity , with the conservation_score alone approaching 80% accuracy.

to determine the proper combination of attributes for the smo classifier, we employed the wrapper subset selection algorithm, which selects an optimal subset of attributes customized for a given classifier among all possible subsets of attributes  <cit> . using a 10-fold cross-validation on three datasets, seven of the  <dig> attributes were selected as an optimal subset – namely, conservation_score, aa_identity, hb_main_chain_protein, distance_to_3_largest_clefts, nearest_cleft_distance, nearest_cleft_rank, and nearest_cleft_sa_area . the four last features belong to one category of closely related attributes describing residue relative position on protein surface; whereas the first three belong to three independent attribute categories -sequence conservation, residue identity, and hydrogen bonds . no further reduction of the set was possible, as the performance of smo for all three datasets dropped if any of the seven attributes was eliminated. consistent with the results in figure  <dig>  the removal of the conservation_score resulted in the most marked reduction . overall, the 7-attribute subset improved the smo prediction using  <dig> attributes with a predictive accuracy from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, and mcc from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

note that this is an optimal feature subset of the properties that provided best accuracy of the smo algorithm in this study. this set does not necessarily represent the only suitable combination or all the relevant attributes. for example, nearest_cleft_sa_area can be substituted by the combination of sas_total_side_rel and nearest_cleft_sa_volume attributes, resulting in another optimal subset of attributes  <cit> .

analysis of the smo prediction with the selected seven residue properties
with the seven selected attributes, the smo algorithm correctly predicted  <dig> of the  <dig> catalytic residues  with an overall predictive accuracy of more than 87% . since the benchmarking dataset had only  <dig> proteins, one may argue that the high performance of the smo algorithm is a result of over-fitting the data, rather than a generalization of the classifier. to ensure that the accuracy is not attributable to the small size of the dataset, we further analyzed the learning curve of the algorithm using 10-fold cross-validation with four performance measures – mcc, % accuracy, true positive  rate, and false positive  rate. to measure the learning curve, we randomly split the data in each dataset into  <dig> parts and increased the size of the dataset by one part incrementally. the performance changed only slightly after 2/ <dig> of the data  were used .

as our benchmarking dataset consisted of structurally and functionally heterogeneous proteins , this learning curve suggests that the enlargement of the dataset would not dramatically change the outcome of the prediction of the smo algorithm, and that the algorithm and the selected features have captured the fundamental properties of catalytic residues . a similar learning curve was obtained  using all  <dig>  residues in the  <dig> proteins as a test set, except that the mcc curve was notably lower due to the large proportion of negative instances .

since the selection of the optimal attribute subset was performed using balanced datasets, we compared the performance of the smo algorithm on the entire benchmarking dataset. no significant changes in the performance of the smo algorithm were detected after the reduction of the initial attribute set down to 7-attribute subset . therefore, the selected set of seven features is, in fact, optimal for the whole benchmarking dataset.

the evaluation on the whole benchmarking dataset mimics the performance of the smo algorithm on the novel proteins, thus the smo algorithm correctly predicted  <dig> of the  <dig> catalytic residues  with an overall predictive accuracy of more than 86%.

our result compared favorably with a feed-forward neural network  trained using a scaled conjugate gradients algorithm  to predict catalytic residues in  <dig> proteins from the catres database  <cit> . the comparison is limited to the performance measurements reported by authors: fp rate , and mcc. the nn was trained on a dataset with 1: <dig> ratio and tested on a dataset with ~1: <dig> ratio between catalytic and non-catalytic residues, whereas our study was trained on a dataset of 1: <dig> ratio, and tested on datasets of 1: <dig> and 1: <dig> ratios . the tp rate of our method is  <dig> , whereas it is  <dig>  before clustering  for the nn. the mcc of our method is comparable with the mcc of the nn algorithm: smo –  <dig> , nn –  <dig>  before clustering and  <dig>  after clustering. the major differences between the two approaches are the selections of the attributes for residue representation and the machine learning algorithm. note that the nn algorithm -'multilayerperceptron' was not among the top seven predictive algorithms in our initial study of best-performing machine learning methods . the parameters for the nn study were chosen based on the previous analysis of relevant features for the catalytic residues  <cit> , such as conservation, diversity of position score, depth from surface, relative solvent accessibility, cleft colocalization, 2d structure, and amino acid identity, which collectively may not represent an optimal set.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of the optimal subset selected from the initial  <dig> residue properties indicates that the smo algorithm learns to distinguish catalytic from non-catalytic residues based on sequence conservation , catalytic propensities of amino acids , relative position of the residue on protein surface , and the number of hydrogen bonds between the residue main chain atoms and other atoms in the protein . the smo algorithm and the seven selected attributes seem to capture the fundamental features of catalytic residues, and can predict catalytic residues with accuracy > 86% for proteins with known structure.

this study shows that the choices of both machine learning algorithm and optimal attributes sets for the selected algorithm are critical for the prediction tasks. conceivably, a similar approach can also be used for the prediction of binding site residues and residues involved in protein-protein interactions.
