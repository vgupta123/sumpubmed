BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common pathogens responsible for acute respiratory infections in ventilated or immunocompromised patients, and for chronic respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis  patients. between  <dig> and  <dig>  the frequency of hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by p. aeruginosa increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, this pathogen thus becoming the main cause of acute respiratory infections  <cit> . mortality rates in ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by p. aeruginosa range from  <dig>  to 87%  <cit> . this bacteria is also associated with over 80% of the morbidity and mortality rates in cf patients  <cit> . these features may be explained by the wide range of both cellular associated and extracellular virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of p. aeruginosa pneumonia  <cit> . indeed, p. aeruginosa is endowed with remarkable virulence factors like lipopolysaccharide, type iii secretion system, pyocyanin and elastase. moreover, it is intrinsically resistant to a large number of antibiotics and can acquire resistances to many others. p. aeruginosa may also form biofilms that protect it from the host immune system, while decreasing antibiotics accessibility and increasing the difficulties of eradication in cf patients particularly  <cit> . therapies based on the exclusive use of antibiotics may then lead to therapeutic impasses and it is necessary to find new therapeutic options to fight p. aeruginosa pulmonary infections.

in this context, the use of probiotic bacteria, either as prophylactic agents for preventing or delaying pulmonary colonisation with p. aeruginosa, or eventually as therapeutic tool to fight p. aeruginosa infections, seems to be particularly attractive.

the emergence of the microbiota concept, with the accumulation of evidences that human associated microbiota play a major role in health and disease  <cit> , induced a profound modification in the perception of probiotics. for long confined to the gastrointestinal tract, where most of their positive effects have been described  <cit> , they are now covering a much broader domain of applications. evidence is emerging that probiotics may have a primordial role in health of the oral cavity  <cit>  or in preventing mechanically ventilated patients from ventilator associated pneumonia. several randomized controlled trials directly exploring the role of probiotics in preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia were published  <cit> . even if the conclusions are controversial, probably because of the heterogeneity of the used probiotic strains, of the mode of administration, of the clinical situations and of the primary endpoint, this strategy seems promising. the lack of rational work for the selection of probiotic strains adapted to the respiratory ecosystem may be also one of the reasons explaining the poor results obtained in certain studies.

in this context, the main objective of this work was the screening for putative probiotic strains active against p. aeruginosa. eighty-seven lactobacilli isolates, isolated from the oral cavity or raw milk, were tested for their capacity to inhibit elastolytic activity and biofilm formation, two main virulence factors of p. aeruginosa. in a second step, the most active isolates were characterized with molecular and phenotypic methods, and their antibiotic resistance and growth capacity in artificial saliva were checked.

RESULTS
isolation and identification of oral lactobacilli
sixty-seven colonies were isolated from the oral cavities of  <dig> healthy volunteers. among them,  <dig> isolates were assigned at the genus level only  by maldi-tof spectrometry analyses with scores below  <dig> , whereas the majority  were assigned at the species level with scores above  <dig> . they belonged to  <dig> lactobacillus species , with a strong representativeness of the lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei groups with respectively  <dig>  and  <dig> isolates . the isolation and characterization strategies of bacterial isolates are shown in figure  <dig>  these  <dig> isolates were pooled with  <dig> lactobacilli from a collection of bacteria isolated from raw milks  <cit> .

effects of ph and acids on p. aeruginosa growth
p. aeruginosa strains are known to be sensitive to organic acids  <cit> . since lactobacillus spp. produce lactic and acetic acids that inhibit the growth of many bacteria through their undissociated forms at low ph, the sensitivity of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> was tested toward both of them at different ph. p. aeruginosa pao <dig> growth was monitored in lb broth by measuring od595nm values at four ph , in presence  or absence of lactic acid. these results are presented in table  <dig>  p. aeruginosa was sensitive to the ph decrease with a pronounced growth inhibition at ph  <dig> and  <dig> . however, no specific effect of lactic acid was observed . the addition of acetic acid induced different effects . as observed previously, the ph induced a significant decrease of p. aeruginosa , but in that case the addition of acetic acid induced a significant reduction of p. aeruginosa growth at ph  <dig>  and at ph  <dig> . no specific effect of acetic acid was detected on p. aeruginosa at ph  <dig>  nor at ph  <dig> , whatever its concentration.

effects of lactobacilli isolates on elastolytic activity
the same eighty-seven isolates were tested for their capacity to inhibit the elastolytic activity of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  only five of them significantly  reduced the activity of elastase after 22 h of co-incubation with p. aeruginosa pao <dig> at 37°c in bhi broth, as compared with the positive control  . among them,  <dig> strains  were l. fermentum isolated from raw milk. they respectively reduced by 37%, 38%, 38% and 47% the elastolytic activity of p. aeruginosa. only one strain isolated from the oral cavity , significantly reduced  the elastolytic activity. when grown in presence of lactobacilli during 22 h and despite a ph decrease ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  units of the bhi medium , no inhibition of p. aeruginosa growth was observed.

formal identification of lactobacilli active against 
p. aeruginosa

once several isolates were shown to be active against p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  their identity was confirmed by 16s rrna and rpoa genes sequencing, and api  <dig> chl . two isolates  were identified as l. paracasei and l. zeae respectively. in the last case, it was not possible to formally distinguish between the two closely related l. zeae and l. casei species by sequencing 16s rna and rpoa genes only. the sequencing of phes gene  was then necessary to formally assigned the od. <dig> strain to the l. zeae species. the eight other active isolates  were shown to belong to l. fermentum. a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  showed that es.a.1a, es.a. <dig> and es.a.6a were clonal strains . es.a. <dig> was then the only one kept for the last tests. the api  <dig> chl gallery confirmed these results for all strains but one, l. zeae od. <dig>  since this method is not designed to identify l. casei nor l. zeae.

antibiotics sensitivity of lactobacilli
all the strains were resistant to vancomycin, as expected for lactobacilli. no other resistance was detected against the  <dig> other antibiotics for any of the tested strains .

lactobacilli growth and acidification properties in artificial saliva
all the strains showed a good capacity to grow in artificial saliva with final concentrations after 48 h of incubation at 37°c comprised between  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  × 107 cfu/ml . whatever the tested strain, no acidification occurred during the first 12 h  . the ph of artificial saliva however differed between tested strains after 24 h of incubation with a clear distinction between two groups. the first group  was poorly acidifying with a decrease of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ph units, whereas the second one  induced a much higher ph decrease with a diminution of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  units. however, after 36 h of incubation, the two facultative heterofermentative strains l. paracasei es.d. <dig> and l. zeae od. <dig> induced the highest ph decrease .

discussion
p. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen in patients with significant underlying diseases. it is one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially in mechanically ventilated patients, in whom it leads to a high mortality rate  <cit> . moreover, chronic airway inflammation with recurrent p. aeruginosa infections is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis  <cit> . high incidence, infection severity and increasing resistance characterizing p. aeruginosa infections highlight the need for new therapeutic options. in that context, different attempts have been made to use probiotic bacteria for fighting p. aeruginosa pulmonary infections  <cit> . lactobacilli are non-pathogenic bacteria closely associated with the human microbiota and commonly used as probiotics. some of them are used because of their positive effects on the immune system, on the barrier effect of epithelia, whereas others are used for their capacity to fight pathogens colonisation either via competitive exclusion or antimicrobial molecules production. probiotic effects are strain-specific, consequently they do not possess the same activity and they are not all recommended for the same health effects  <cit> . specific selection criteria are then needed in order to find the right probiotic harbouring the appropriated activity  within a particular ecological niche. some lactobacillus spp. , administered by oropharyngeal application or via orogastric or nasogastric tube, have already been tested, with different levels of success, in mechanically ventilated patients to fight p. aeruginosa pneumonia  <cit> . to our knowledge, none of them was specifically selected according to its capacity to inhibit p. aeruginosa, nor to survive in the oral cavity or in the oropharynx. the main goal of this work was then to test the capacity of lactobacilli isolated from oral cavities of healthy volunteers and from raw milk to inhibit the production of virulence factors by p. aeruginosa pao <dig> in order to look for potential probiotic bacteria capable to prevent p. aeruginosa pneumonia.

in this study,  <dig> isolates belonging to  <dig> lactobacillus species , with a prevalence of l. fermentum and l. paracasei, were recovered from the oral cavities of  <dig> healthy volunteers. the diversity of lactobacilli isolated from the oral cavity is generally high, and these  <dig> species are commonly encountered in healthy persons  <cit> . since it has been suggested that oral lactobacilli may originate from the food  <cit> ,  <dig> lactobacillus strains  isolated from raw milk and whom certain species have been previously described in the oral cavity were added to increase the pool of the tested strains. although lactobacilli do not belong to the predominant oral microbiota, in which they account for less than 1% of the cultivable fraction, they are suspected to have a considerable effect on the homeostasis of this ecosystem  <cit> .

among the  <dig> tested isolates, the  <dig> most active ones against p. aeruginosa virulence factors were identified at the species level using a polyphasic approach combining phenotypic  and molecular  methods, whereas typing of l. fermentum strains was performed using pfge.

finally  <dig> strains  showed a significant inhibitory effect against p. aeruginosa pao <dig> biofilm formation or elastolytic activity. with the exception of l. zeae and l. paracasei that are facultative heterofermentative, all the active strains belonged to the l. fermentum species and were then obligate heterofermentative, producing both lactic and acetic acids from glucose. it has been shown that one of the major antibacterial effects of lactobacilli is mediated via lactic and acetic acids production  <cit> . indeed, lactobacilli may produce high concentrations of lactic acid and acetic acid depending on their fermentative pathways and growth conditions. we have shown that p. aeruginosa pao <dig> was sensitive to ph and acetic acid with a dose-dependent effect, growth inhibition increasing in parallel with an increase in acid concentration and ph decrease. at a ph of  <dig> or  <dig>  acetic acid completely inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa at a concentration of 25 mm, whereas high concentrations  of acetic acid were necessary to partially inhibit p. aeruginosa growth at ph  <dig>  for that reason, the inhibitory activities of lactobacilli toward p. aeruginosa pao <dig> biofilm formation and elastolytic activity were not tested in mrs medium that contains a high glucose concentration , but in bhi medium. indeed, this medium contains a low concentration of glucose  that limits the growth of lactobacillus strains and prevents a strong acidification, allowing a better differentiation between the organic acids effects from other mechanisms of action.

elastolytic activity and biofilm formation are two majors virulence factors observed in p. aeruginosa. among the  <dig> strains  significantly inhibiting elastase activity or biofilm formation, it is interesting to note that the four l. fermentum strains of milk origin  inhibited elastolytic activity only, whereas the ones originating from the oral cavity  inhibited biofilm formation only. the two other active strains from the oral cavity, l. zeae od. <dig> and l. paracasei es.d. <dig> significantly inhibited elastase activity and biofilm formation respectively. elastase has been shown to destroy respiratory epithelium tight junctions, increasing permeability disorders and interleukin- <dig> levels while decreasing host immune response  <cit> . we previously showed in a murine model of p. aeruginosa pneumonia, that elastolytic activity was positively correlated to acute lung injury  <cit> . it has been shown by rumbaugh et al. that elastolytic activity and biofilm formation are under control of the quorum sensing molecules of p. aeruginosa <cit> . different mechanisms of action may then be hypothesized, active lactobacillus strains inhibited the quorum sensing targets, either they secreted antagonistic analogues of acyl-homoserine lactone or they inhibited regulating lasr or lasi genes factors  <cit> . moreover, the use of the bhi medium that induced a limited ph decrease, together with the low number of active strains, suggested that other mechanisms of action than organic acids production were implicated. it has been shown that surface properties, such as cell charge and hydrophobicity, implicated in the non-specific adhesive capacity of bacteria differ among lactobacillus strains isolated from the oral cavity of healthy volunteers, with several strains  showing very high adhesive properties  <cit> . such a difference in surface properties between lactobacilli strains with a prevalence of high adhesive properties in lactobacilli strains isolated from the mouth might be implicated in their higher capacity to prevent biofilm formation as compared to dairy lactobacilli. indeed surface properties are involved in adhesion properties to plastic and/or in the co-aggregation with p. aeruginosa that could be implicated in decreasing biofilm formation. however, further studies are needed to elucidate the antagonistic mechanism of action between described lactobacilli strains and p. aeruginosa.

antagonistic activities of probiotic bacteria require a certain capacity to survive and/or to grow in the targeted ecosystem. all active strains showed a good capacity to grow in artificial saliva, suggesting that they may survive in the oral environment. however, it has been suggested that some probiotics may be implicated in the development of dental caries  <cit> . the use of poorly acidifying strains such as l. fermentum k.v <dig> .2b and k.v <dig> .2c inhibiting elastolytic activity and l. fermentum es.f. <dig> and es.a. <dig> inhibiting biofilm formation may then be encouraged in their use as probiotics to fight p. aeruginosa pulmonary infection compared to the more acidifying ones. however, knowing that acid production strongly inhibits p. aeruginosa growth, the use of more acidifying strains may be also investigated and subjected to an appropriate follow-up of dental health during probiotic application. another theoretical concern regarding the safety of probiotics is the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes toward the oral and gastrointestinal microbiota. in our study, as expected for lactobacilli that are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, all the strains were resistant to vancomycin  <cit> . no other resistance towards the recommended antibiotics was detected. on the other hand the toxic effect of putative probiotic on the epithelial cells from the oropharynx and respiratory tract will have to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
the pathogenesis of ventilator acquired pneumonia requires micro-aspiration of oropharynx microbiota into the lower airway. the natural oropharynx microbiota of patients is modified by exogenous bacteria from the hands of the health care workers for example or by endogenous bacteria such as the intestinal microbiota by retrograde contamination. in our study, we screened  <dig> lactobacilli isolates from the oral cavity of healthy people and from milk with the aim to prevent p. aeruginosa from colonising the oropharynx environment. eight strains, devoid of acquired antibiotic resistance were able to grow in artificial saliva and to decrease two virulence factors  of p. aeruginosa in vitro. the next step will be to check if these strains induce a significant protective effect in an in vivo model of p. aeruginosa pneumonia.
