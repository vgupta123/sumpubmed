BACKGROUND
sortases are membrane-bound cysteine transpeptidases that anchor surface proteins to the peptidoglycan cell wall in gram-positive bacteria. surface proteins anchored via sortases are often essential virulence factors important in colonization and invasion, evasion of the host immune system, and nutrient acquisition. the sorting process is mediated by a conserved c-terminal cell wall sorting signal on the anchored protein, comprised of a c-terminal recognition sequence , followed closely by a hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a positively charged tail  <cit> . a conserved catalytic cysteine residue of the sortase cleaves the lpxtg motif of the polypeptide between the threonine and glycine residues and covalently attaches the protein to the peptidoglycan .

there are six described sortase families, a-f, that share amino acid similarity  <cit> . all catalyze similar transpeptidation reactions, but recognize different substrate motifs and serve different functions within the cell. class a sortases , such as the prototypical staphylococcus aureus sortase a , are considered housekeeping sortases as they are capable of anchoring many functionally distinct proteins to the cell wall. sasrta, which recognizes an lpxtg motif, is responsible for anchoring a variety of surface proteins involved in adherence and immune response evasion, and is essential for virulence in animal models  <cit> . srta orthologues have been found in the genomes of almost all gram-positive bacteria . class b sortases are functionally different from class a in their substrate specificity. in s. aureus and b. anthracis, the sortase b gene  is part of an iron-regulated locus isd  responsible for heme-iron transport, and anchors the iron transporter protein, isdc, by recognizing an npqtn motif  <cit> . though mutating srtb has no effect on establishing infection, sasrtb is required for persistence of the bacterium in mice  <cit> .

clostridium difficile, an anaerobic gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus, is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infectious diarrhea in north america and europe. infection with c. difficile can result in a range of clinical presentations, from mild self-limiting diarrhea to the life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis , known collectively as c. difficile infection   <cit> . mlst studies have identified that the c. difficile population structure forms at least five distinct lineages that are all associated with cdi . complications of severe cdi can lead to toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, sepsis and death in up to 25% of cases  <cit> . broad-spectrum antibiotic usage is the greatest risk factor for development of cdi due to the consequent disruption of the intestinal microflora. treatment of cdi with metronidazole and vancomycin can exacerbate the problem by continuing to disrupt the intestinal microflora. this leaves the patient susceptible to relapse or re-infection. approximately one third of patients experience cdi relapse following treatment, and those who relapse have a greater risk of succumbing to the infection  <cit> . a current imperative is the development of therapies that selectively target c. difficile, whilst leaving the intestinal microflora intact.

the c. difficile reference strain  <dig> encodes a single predicted sortase, cd630_ <dig>  which has high amino-acid similarity with srtb of s. aureus and b. anthracis  <cit> . a second sortase encoded within the genome is interrupted by a stop codon prior to the catalytic cysteine and is considered a pseudogene. thus, in contrast to other gram-positive bacteria, c. difficile appears to have only a single functional sortase. as such, a compound that inhibits the activity of c. difficile sortase could target the pathogen without disrupting the numerous gram-negative bacteria that make up the intestinal flora.

in this study, we demonstrate that the predicted sortase encoded by cd630_ <dig> recognizes and cleaves an pxtg motif between the threonine and glycine residues. the cleavage of this motif is dependent on the conserved cysteine residue at position  <dig> in the predicted active site of the sortase. we have also identified seven putative sortase substrates, all of which contain the pxtg motif. these substrates are conserved among the five c. difficile lineages and include potential adhesins, a 5’ nucleotidase, and cell wall hydrolases. furthermore, we identified a number of small-molecule inhibitors by means of an in silico screen that inhibit the activity of the c. difficile srtb.

RESULTS
conservation of the catalytically active residues of sortase
the genome sequence of c. difficile strain  <dig> previously indicated the presence of a single copy of a sortase-like protein, encoded by cd630_ <dig>  based on the presence of the sortase catalytic motif tlxtc  <cit> . we performed blast searches  to reveal the protein encoded by cd630_ <dig> shares 32% and 34% amino acid identity with srtb from s. aureus  and b. anthracis , respectively. in addition to the tlxtc active site, the catalytically essential histidine  and arginine  residues  <cit>  are conserved in the c. difficile srtb. a structural prediction analysis of srtb was performed using phyre <dig> protein fold recognition server   <cit> , and the resulting alignment suggests a high level of conservation between the predicted secondary structure of srtb and the known crystal structure of the basrtb  <cit>  . expression of c. difficile srtb was analysed in vitro using rt-pcr analysis on strain  <dig>  which confirmed that cd <dig> is actively transcribed during early exponential, late exponential and stationary phases .figure  <dig>

the c. difficile population structure forms at least five distinct clonal lineages that are all associated with human infection . to determine whether srtb is conserved between c. difficile strains, representatives for each of the five distinct clades were chosen for analysis based on the availability of a fully annotated sequence: c. difficile strains  <dig> for clade  <dig>  r <dig> and cd <dig>  for clade  <dig>  <cit> , m <dig> and cf <dig>  for clade  <dig>  <cit> , cd <dig>  for clade  <dig> , and m <dig>  for clade  <dig>  <cit> . blast searches of these representative strains show that srtb is conserved across all five c. difficile lineages. a second sortase-like gene in the  <dig> genome, classified as a pseudogene because of an in frame stop codon prior to the catalytic cysteine, is absent from the other four c. difficile lineages.

bioinformatic prediction of sortase substrates
a bioinformatics approach was used for the preliminary identification of sortase substrate proteins in c. difficile strain  <dig>  the predicted recognition sequence for cd630_ <dig> has been proposed to be pxtg by pallen et al.  <cit> , and recently to also include the sequence nvqtg, found in the surface- associated collagen binding protein cbpa, by tulli et al.  <cit> . putative proteins were screened for the patterns pxtg and nvqtg at the c-terminus  <cit> . putative candidates were then assessed for the known features of a sortase substrate: a predicted n-terminal signal peptide sequence, and a cell wall sorting signal comprising of a potential transmembrane domain following the sortase recognition sequence, and at least two consecutive basic residues  at the c-terminus .

eight proteins satisfied our definition of a sortase substrate in strain  <dig> . the newly described c. difficile collagen binding protein a, cbpa, is the only protein containing the proposed nvqtg motif  <cit> . the remaining proteins contained one of four observed variations of the pxtg motif: spktg, ppktg, and spstg and spqtg. these predicted c. difficile sortase substrates are a diverse range of surface proteins that include putative cell wall hydrolases, putative adhesins, a collagen-binding protein, and a 5’ nucleotidase/phosphoesterase . transcriptional analysis performed by rt-pcr confirmed that all eight predicted substrate proteins are transcribed during growth in vitro . the eight predicted substrates are transcribed during all three growth phases examined, with the exception of cd630_ <dig> and cd630_ <dig>  which do not appear to be transcribed during stationary phase. four of these putative substrates are conserved across all five c. difficile lineages: cd630_ <dig>  cd630_ <dig>  cd630_ <dig>  and cd630_ <dig> table  <dig>

purified c. difficile srtb cleaves pxtg peptides
to determine whether c. difficile srtb cleaves putative substrates at the predicted motifs, fret peptides were designed based on the variations observed in the predicted pxtg motif . two residues upstream of the motif were included, and two glycine residues were incorporated downstream, as this has been previously shown to improve sortase cleavage efficiency in vitro  <cit> . fluorescence of the edans fluorophore within the peptides is blocked when in close proximity to the fluorescent quencher dabcyl  <cit> . when the peptide is cleaved, the edans fluorophore is separated from dabcyl, and a fluorescent signal is observed.table  <dig>

analysis of fret reaction
to investigate the importance of the cysteine residue in the proposed active site of c. difficile srtb, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace the cysteine residue at position  <dig> with an alanine. when the resulting mutant protein srtbΔn <dig> c209a was incubated with the fret peptides, the fluorescent signal fell below the limits of detection , indicating that the cysteine residue at position  <dig> was essential for the activity of the c. difficile srtb. cleavage in the fret-based assay was also inhibited by the addition of mtset , a known cysteine protease inhibitor and inhibitor of sortase function in s. aureus  <cit>  and b. anthracis  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the cleavage of the spktg, ppktg, and spqtg motifs was enhanced at least two-fold by the addition of the two native amino acids immediately downstream of this sequon . analysis of the fret reaction with these modified peptides revealed that srtbΔn <dig>  cleaves these peptides between the t and g residues. maldi analysis of d-pvppktgds-e peptide incubated with srtbΔn <dig> results in a peptide with a mass of 889 da, corresponding to the fragment d-pvppkt-oh . the peptide control, incubated without srtbΔn <dig>  lacked this fragment . cleavage between the t and g residues for the d-sdspktgdn-e and d-ihspqtgdv-e peptides was also confirmed , indicating that c. difficile srtb cleaves the pxtg motif between the same residues as other functional sortases  <cit> .figure  <dig>

kinetic measurements of srtb activity
in order to calculate the in vitro kinetic parameters of srtbΔn <dig> for the d-sdspktgdn-e and d-pvppktgds-e peptides, we performed a kinetic analysis of the sortase-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction. figure 7a shows the progress curves of the srtbΔn <dig> catalyzed hydrolysis reactions at various d-sdspktgdn-e concentrations. for each progress curve, the amount of fluorescent product  was approximately 5% of the initial substrate concentration. within the time period analyzed, the progress curves are linear, so the steady state rate  was determined by fitting the data to a linear function. figure 7b shows v plotted against the concentration of the peptide. non-linear regression of these data fitted to a modified michaelis-menten equation incorporating substrate inhibition :figure  <dig>

inhibiting srtb activity
we sought to determine whether c. difficile srtb could be specifically targeted using small-molecule inhibitors. the published crystal structure of the b. anthracis srtb   <cit>  was used as a template for the selection of potential c. difficile srtb inhibitors. these orthologous proteins show 70% identity and 90% similarity at the active site, and their differences are confined to the periphery of the active site. the proprietary leadbuilder virtual-screening method  was used to interrogate the protocats database of potential protease inhibitors with pharmacophoric and docking filters derived from analysis of the basrtb crystal structure. protocats comprises  <dig>  commercially-available compounds that may form reversible transition-state-like complexes with protease enzymes. compounds in protocats contain a carbonyl group which is activated to make a fully reversible complex with the active-site serine/cysteine group by virtue of adjacent moderately electron-withdrawing substituents, which are not leaving groups. some examples of these functional groups are α-ketoamides and aryl ketones. figure 8a shows one of the identified compounds docking within the active site structure of basrtb.figure  <dig>

discussion
c. difficile infection is invariably associated with the disruption of the normal intestinal microflora by the administration of broad spectrum antibiotics. thus there is a pressing need to develop therapies that selectively target c. difficile while leaving the intestinal microflora intact. the c. difficile reference strain  <dig> encodes a single predicted sortase, cd630_ <dig>  which has strong amino acid similarity with srtb of s. aureus and b. anthracis  <cit> . sortase substrates frequently contribute toward pathogenesis via their involvement in attachment to specific tissues during infection , as well as the bacteria’s ability to evade the immune response of the host  <cit> . sortases, although not essential for growth or viability of the organism, are often essential for virulence in gram-positive organisms; inactivation of sortases reduces colonization in mice  <cit> , and decreases adhesion and invasion in vitro  <cit> . sortases and their substrates are considered promising targets for the development of new anti-infective compounds  <cit> . unusually for gram-positive bacteria, c. difficile appears to possess a single sortase enzyme that is likely to be important for the viability of the pathogen as we have been unable to construct a c. difficile strain  <dig> srtb defined mutant . inhibiting the c. difficile sortase could prove to be a strategy to specifically target c. difficile.

in this study, we cloned, expressed and characterized the sortase encoded by cd630_ <dig> of c. difficile  <dig>  a predicted class b sortase . sortase nomenclature is based on sequence similarity to the known classes of sortase, a-f  <cit> . sortases of class b typically are involved in heme-iron uptake and tend to be expressed in operons with their substrates  <cit> . genes encoding class a sortases are not found in proximity to their substrates, which consist of a variety of surface proteins with diverse biological functions. several exceptions to these rules have already been described, notably a class b sortase that polymerizes pilin subunits in s. pyogenes  <cit> , and a class e sortase from c. diphtheriae that serves a housekeeping function  <cit> . the potential c. difficile sortase substrates identified in this paper comprise a diverse range of surface proteins, suggesting that srtb may serve as a housekeeping sortase in c. difficile, a function usually reserved for class a sortases.

these potential sortase substrates in c. difficile strain  <dig> comprise of seven proteins, all containing an pxtg motif, that are predicted to be surface localized and are conserved across c. difficile strains. recently it was proposed that a c. difficile collagen binding protein, cbpa, may be sorted to the cell surface by sortase recognizing an nvqtg motif  <cit> . in this study, we developed a fret-based assay to demonstrate that srtb of c. difficile recognizes and cleaves the pxtg motif between the threonine and glycine residues, and that cleavage is dependent on a single cysteine residue at position  <dig>  srtbΔn <dig> does not appear to cleave the s. aureus srta and srtb motifs, lpxtg and npqtn, respectively, nor the nvqtg motif in vitro, suggesting that cbpa from c. difficile may be attached to the cell surface by another mechanism.

the fret-based assay enabled us to determine kinetic parameters for the recombinant c. difficile srtb. although the catalytic activity appears low, low catalytic efficiency is observed for most sortases in vitro  <cit> . the kinetic and cleavage data we report for srtbΔn <dig> is consistent with this trend. in vivo, the sorting motifs are part of a larger protein, and the transpeptidation substrates are part of a cell wall precursor or mature peptidoglycan  <cit> . the transpeptidation reaction has been observed in vitro for sortases from bacteria with a lys-type peptidoglycan, where cross-linking occurs through a peptide bridge  <cit>  such as s. aureus and streptococcus species  <cit> , but not for bacteria with dap-type peptidoglycan such as bacillus with direct cross-linkages through m-diaminopimelic acid  <cit> . the likely cell wall anchor of the c. difficile srtb substrates is the diaminopimelic acid cross-link  <cit> , similar to bacillus. when transpeptidation is observed in vitro, the cleavage efficiency of sortase increases.

this study revealed that recombinant srtbΔn <dig> cleaves the pxtg motifs with varying levels of efficiency, cleaving the sequences ppktg and spqtg with the greatest efficiency. apparent preferential cleavage efficiency of certain substrate sequences in vitro has been observed in other sortases. for example, in b. anthracis, basrta cleaves lpxtg peptides more readily than a peptide containing the sequence lpnta  <cit> . the biological significance of this peptide sequence preference is unknown.

small-molecule inhibitors with activity against srta and srtb have been reported that prevent cleavage of fluorescently-labelled peptide compounds by sortase in vitro  <cit> . these compounds inhibit cell adhesion to fibronectin, yet, they have no effect on in vitro growth. inhibitors tested against srta, srtb and srtc in b. anthracis irreversibly modified the active cysteine residue  <cit> . several compounds identified in this study had an inhibitory effect on c. difficile srtb activity. however, these lead compounds had no direct effect on in vitro c. difficile growth , which is consistent with observations in s. aureus  <cit> . inhibition of bacterial growth is not considered vital in the development of sortase-based drug therapies. in both staphylococcus and bacillus, sortase inhibitors show good suitability for further development as therapeutics despite their lack of bactericidal activity. when mice challenged with s. aureus were treated with sortase inhibitor compounds, infection rates and mortality were reduced  <cit> , despite these compounds having no effect on staphylococcal growth  <cit> . the use of in silico approaches such as the leadbuilder method employed by this study to screen databases of putative small-molecule inhibitors for further analysis has been validated. further analysis of the structural similarities between the hit compounds could lead to a refinement of srtb inhibitor design and increased potency in vitro.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we demonstrate that c. difficile encodes a single sortase, srtb, with in vitro activity. we have confirmed the c. difficile srtb recognition sequence as pxtg, and show that c. difficile srtb cleaves the pxtg motif within peptides between the threonine and glycine residues. the cysteine residue within the predicted active site is essential for activity of the enzyme, and the cleavage of fluorescently-labelled peptides can be inhibited by mtset, a known cysteine protease inhibitor. srtb inhibitors identified through our in silico screen show a greater level of efficacy then mtset at inhibiting the protease activity of c. difficile srtb. such inhibitors provide a significant step in successfully identifying c. difficile srtb inhibitor compounds, which can be further refined to enhance their efficacy, and may contribute towards the development of novel selective therapeutics against cdi.
