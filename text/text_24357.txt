BACKGROUND
pectinolytic bacteria belonging to the dickeya and pectobacterium genera are pathogens that cause soft rot and blackleg diseases in a wide range of plants and crops including solanum tuberosum  <cit> . these phytopathogens produce plant cell-wall degrading enzymes that are able to macerate the tuber and stem tissues, thus provoking the disease symptoms  <cit> . since 2000s, the emerging d. solani species has been proposed as a contributor to the increased incidence of blackleg and soft rot diseases on potato crop in europe and the mediterranean basin  <cit> . the d. solani species has been officially described recently  <cit> .

little is known about the ecological and genetic traits that may support the relative success of d. solani in invading potato fields  <cit> . d. solani can initiate disease from a low inoculum level in warm climates and was described in some studies to spread more easily through vascular tissues than other dickeya species  <cit> . besides classical intergenic spacers 16s-23s rdna  <cit> , several molecular studies have proposed different marker genes for the identification of d. solani strains collected from potato and ornamental plants, such as dnax  <cit> , reca  <cit>  and flic  <cit> . at whole genome level, genomic and metabolic comparisons of two d. solani strains ds0432- <dig>  and  <dig>  vs. d. dadantii  <dig> indicated a conserved synteny between the two species, but also the presence of distinctive traits  <cit> . d. solani and d. dadantii diverged in their battery of non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide synthase clusters, t5ss/t6ss-related toxin-antitoxin systems and several metabolic abilities. some of these traits would contribute to the successful invasion of this pathogen  <cit> . more recently, a reverse genetic approach revealed that the virulence master regulators are quite the same in d. solani and d. dadantii  <cit> .

the analysis of population genome structure and dynamics, including additive or replacing horizontal gene transfer  may bring valuable clues on the mechanisms of emergence of d. solani. while additive hgt allows the acquisition of novel genes by a population , replacing hgt provokes the replacement of an allele by another from close relatives  <cit> . hgt events inform about the genome diversification and adaptation processes, but also on the companion populations that the pathogens met during the emergence and dissemination steps. replacing hgt is also of a major stake in pathogen diagnostic, as it may provoke false identification when the alleles exchanged by replacing hgt are used as molecular taxonomic markers.

here, we analyzed the whole genome polymorphism of  <dig> d. solani isolates, including the type strain ipo2222t, collected from different geographic locations, dates of isolation and plant hosts. we combined illumina and pacbio technologies to complete the  <dig> d. solani strain genome that we used as a reference in the comparative genomics. while most strains belonged to a core-population that exhibited less than one hundred variant positions between two given genomes, some other genomes revealed massive replacing hgt from the companion pathogen d. dianthicola and a plasmid acquisition from burkholderia ambifaria. moreover, we were able to correlate snps in virulence genes with a decrease in aggressiveness, highlighting the power of genomics as a tool to reveal functional variability in d. solani population. to our knowledge this is the first study that reports whole genome analysis of a d. solani population and describes its diversity.

RESULTS
complete genome of the d. solani 3337
the d. solani  <dig> genome was previously sequenced by illumina technology using two libraries  and de novo assembled in a high quality draft genome deposited at ncbi  <cit> . in this work, the  <dig> d. solani genome was re-sequenced using pacbio technology. the pacbio sequencing generated six contigs  with an average  <dig> fold coverage. the published illumina-scaffolding was confirmed and the remaining gaps were filled using the pacbio contigs. hence, combining the illumina and pacbio sets of sequences, we obtained a complete sequence of the unique circular chromosome . the rast annotation generated  <dig>  <dig> cds and  <dig> rnas. the d. solani  <dig> complete genome was used as a reference for comparative genomics.

positioning the sequenced d. solani strains within the dickeya genus
in addition to d. solani  <dig>   <dig> d. solani strains including the type strain ipo2222t were collected at different years and geographical locations  and their genomes sequenced by illumina technology. all these draft and complete genomes were used in multi-locus sequence analysis  and average nucleotide identity  calculation. for mlsa, the eleven concatenated rpod, gyrb, reca, rpos, dnax, dnaa, gapa, fusa, rplb, pura, gyra housekeeping genes  were aligned to construct a relation-tree using neighbor-joining method, the evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method  <cit> . all the d. solani  isolates were grouped in a same cluster that was separated from the other pectinolytic enterobacteria . noticeably, the strain dsl  <dig> was the unique strain that was consistently distant from the other d. solani strains. as previously reported  <cit> , within the genus dickeya the most related species to d. solani were d. dadantii and d. dianthicola. ani values which were calculated using the strain dsl  <dig> as a reference were in accordance with the mlsa clustering. all the d. solani strains exhibited an ani value equal to or above  <dig>  %, but that of dsl  <dig> was below 99 %. among strains of the closest species, d. dadantii and d. dianthicola ani values dropped to 94 % and 92 %, respectively.fig.  <dig> mlsa and anis of d. solani strains. in mlsa the sequences of the genes  were aligned with clustalw, and a neighbour-joining tree was created by bootstrap method with  <dig> bootstrap replications. ani values were calculated using dsl  <dig> as a reference



overview of the snp and indel variations in d. solani genomes
illumina reads of the d. solani strains were mapped on the complete genome sequence of dsl  <dig>  the percentage of mapped reads was above 99 % for all strains with the exception of dsl  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the mapping vs. dsl  <dig>  which reached a high mean coverage value , allowed us to identify variations  in each of the genomes . according to the number of variations, the d. solani strains could be clustered into three groups. the first group, which we thereafter term as the core-population, encompassed most of the strains  with a variation number ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  in the second group were the strains dsl 07- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with a variation number between  <dig> and  <dig>  the third group consisted in the only strain dsl  <dig> with a very high variation number that reached  <dig>  rast annotation of the strain dsl  <dig> was used to position the variations in or out coding dna sequences , as well as to identify non-synonymous variations in cdss . non-synonymous variations ranged between  <dig> and 21 % of the total number of variations, hence only  <dig> to  <dig> non-synonymous variations were identified in strains of the d. solani core-population .

heterogeneous distribution of the snp and indel variations in d. solani genes
we refined our analysis by calculating the number of genes  that were affected by snps and indels as well as non-synonymous variations . in the core-population,  <dig> to  <dig> genes exhibited variations and about one half of them  harbored non-synonymous variations. in dsl 07- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> genes were affected; and among them,  <dig> to  <dig> contained non-synonymous variations. in dsl  <dig>   <dig> genes, hence half of the genome showed variations. to compare variation abundance in genes, a mean value of the number of all variations  per affected gene was calculated . in the core-population, this value ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  in dsl  <dig> and 07– <dig>  it was similar  while the highest value was observed in dsl  <dig> and  <dig> . overall, these analyses revealed that dsl  <dig>  07– <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> harbored genes with different numbers of variations as compared to those in the core-population, suggesting putative hgts from distinct sources.fig.  <dig> number of genes affected by variations . a total number of genes affected by the variations for each strain. b number of genes revealing amino acids change further variation. c the average number of variations affecting the genes in each strain



finally, all these different variations were positioned along the dsl chromosome . in the core-population, the rare variations appeared to be scattered with a mean distribution of  <dig>  variations per kbp  and  <dig>  variations per gene . in dsl  <dig>   <dig> and 07– <dig>  most of the variations affected several tens of genes that are clustered in distinct regions, while only a few variations remain scattered. in dsl  <dig>  variations exhibited a genome wide distribution. in the next part of the work, the three types of snp/indel distribution  have been analyzed in details.fig.  <dig> mapping of the clustered and scaterred snp/indel variations using dsl  <dig> as a reference genome. small colored sticks indicate variations positions: the scattered snp/indels are in blue color, while the clustered snp/indels  are in red color and are numbered according to their successive position along the chromosome. dsl  <dig> is excluded from this figure due to high number of variations



the mosaic genome of d. solani  <dig> might define a novel d. solani sub-group
dsl  <dig> differed from the other d. solani by the high number and wide distribution of variations , a unique phylogenetic position in mlsa , and a high percentage  of unmapped reads against dsl  <dig> genome . unmapped reads were used for a de novo assembly which generated six contigs with a size ranging from  <dig> 248 bp to  <dig> 630 bp. all these six contigs were absent from the other d. solani strains. using mauve  <cit> , these six sequences were positioned on the draft genome of dsl  <dig> that was constructed using the strain dsl  <dig> as a reference . rast annotation indicated that most of the genes belonging to these  <dig> contigs coded for phage elements and hypothetical or unknown proteins, with the exception of some genes coding for two putative abc transporters, two putative virulence factors and one methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein, all being carried by the contig <dig>  the similarity scores were too weak to assign a more precise function and phylogenetic origin to these putative genes/proteins.

another characteristic of dsl  <dig> was a high number of genes  that exhibited variations. these genes were distributed along the genome without any clustering in specific regions. constructed phylogenetic trees revealed that the analyzed genes exhibiting a nucleotide identity below 98 %  did not belong to the core population gene cluster . all these features supported the existence of a novel d. solani sub-group. the strain dsl  <dig> could be proposed as the eponym of the d. solani  <dig> sub-group.fig.  <dig> mapping and phylogeny of the dsl  <dig> variant genes. in panel a, position of variant genes of dsl  <dig> on the reference strains dsl  <dig>  the panels b, c, d and e exemplify phylogenetic trees of selected proteins with different percentage of nucleotide identity



infra-species replacing hgt in dsl 07-7
the  <dig> variant genes of dsl 07- <dig> showed a non-uniform distribution along the chromosome, since most of them were clustered in  <dig> separate regions. one of these regions, which is presented in fig.  <dig>  contained four genes: oppb, oppf, an abc transporter gene and amn. these genes contained in total  <dig> variations leading to a decrease of their nucleotide identity as compared to the corresponding genes in the dsl  <dig> genome. moreover, the phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequence coded by the oppb and oppf genes, which were the most affected by variations, revealed a replacing hgt from a strain belonging to the d. solani  <dig> sub-group. the  <dig> other regions exhibited a similar gene organization and a phylogenetic clustering with dsl  <dig> genes. hence, all these  <dig> regions were called as rgt  regions. they were numbered according to their successive position along the chromosome with the strain name in subscript position: rgt107- <dig>  rgt207- <dig>  rgt307- <dig> … . this analysis suggested that dsl 07- <dig> acquired a dozen of gene fragments during massive replacing hgt from strain belonging to the dsl  <dig> sub-group. hence, dsl 07- <dig> exemplified the occurrence of an infra-specific gene exchange among the d. solani population, and also supported the possible co-existence of strains of the d. solani  <dig> sub-group with those of the core-population.fig.  <dig> replacing hgt region  <dig>  in d .solani 07- <dig>  gene map indicates the synteny conservation with dsl  <dig>  the nucleotide identity decreases and the variation number increases at the positions of dna acquisition, hence affecting the phylogenetic relationship of the encoded proteins



inter-species replacing hgt in d. solani strains  <dig> and 9019
in dsl  <dig>   <dig> among the  <dig> genes with variations were clustered in  <dig> rgt regions, the other genes with variations being scattered along the chromosome. in dsl  <dig>   <dig> among the  <dig> genes with variations were clustered in  <dig> rgt regions. in both strains, the rgt regions were named according to the same nomenclature as in dsl 07- <dig> .

the rgt <dig> illustrated the typical organization of these rgts in dsl  <dig> . rgt <dig>  exhibited  <dig> positions of variations that were distributed in three genes: norf, norr, and fuma. these genes were related to the nitric oxide metabolism. because of the high number of variations, the gene identity with d. solani strain  <dig> decreased in rgt <dig>  especially in the norr gene that was located in the central part of the rgt region. protein phylogeny revealed that the three proteins encoded by the rgt <dig> genes did not branch with their d. solani counterparts but were most closely related to those of d. dianthicola. the variation positions suggested that replacing hgt occurred in the middle of the genes norf and fuma, and hence generated proteins with an intermediate position between the d. solani and d. dianthicola proteins in the phylogenetic trees. a second example of inter-species replacing hgt is given with the rgt <dig>  of dsl  <dig>  which contained five genes dnaj, dnak, yaah, a mfs transporter gene and moga . this example highlighted that replacing hgt might also affect genes such as dnak and dnaj which are used for mlsa and taxonomic identification  <cit> . in rgt <dig>   <dig> variants were detected. discrepancies within dnaj, dnak and moga phylogenies suggested the occurrence of a replacing hgt from d. dianthicola. in all the other rgts of dsl  <dig> and  <dig>  a phylogeny approach  also supported the occurrence of a replacing hgt using d. dianthicola population as the unique source.fig.  <dig> replacing hgt region  <dig>  in d. solani  <dig>  gene map indicates the synteny conservation with dsl  <dig>  the nucleotide identity decreases and the variation number increases at the position of dna acquisition, hence affecting the phylogenetic relationship of the encoded proteins

fig.  <dig> replacing hgt region  <dig>  in d. solani  <dig>  gene map indicates the synteny conservation with dsl  <dig>  the nucleotide identity decreases and the variant number increase at the position of dna acquisition, hence affecting the phylogenetic relationship of the encoded proteins



plasmid acquisition in d. solani strain  <dig> from burkholderia
in addition to replacing hgt, an additive hgt event that consisted in a plasmid acquisition occurred in dsl  <dig>  the dsl  <dig> unmapped reads, which represented  <dig>  % of the total read number , allowed the generation of a single contig  by de novo assembly. this plasmid exhibited a complete identity  with a plasmid of bulkholderia ambifaria ammd . the stable replication of this plasmid in dsl  <dig> was verified in sub-cultures using plasmid-specific primers .

in d. solani  <dig>  variations in flagellar genes correlated motility and virulence decrease
all the non-synonymous variations of the core-population were listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  remarkably, two unique non-synonymous variations that affected the flic and flin flagellar genes were present in dsl  <dig>  the substitution c to t at the position  <dig> lead to conversion of ala <dig> to thr in flic, while deletion of the gtc codon starting at the position  <dig>  <dig> provoke the loss of the val <dig> in flin. the nucleotide variations were verified by sanger sequencing. these two variations were unique among the sequenced d. solani strains, as well as the known dickeya genomes . these genes retained our attention as fli genes are required for aggressiveness in dickeya and in other enterobaceteriaceace . we hypothesized that dsl  <dig> could be impaired in motility, hence also exhibited a reduced aggressiveness on potato host plants. we compared motility and virulence of all the  <dig> dsl analyzed in this study . all strains except dsl  <dig> were motile. moreover, a weak aggressiveness of the strain  <dig> was observed in virulence assay on potato tuber, hence correlating genomic variants in fli genes with motility and virulence deficiency. as a consequence, even if snp/indel variations are scarce, some of them may affect virulence functions in dsl strains.fig.  <dig> motility and aggressiveness assays performed on potato tubers. the average of variants per gene was calculated for each strain . the signs + and - indicate that the strain is motile or not. the letters b, c, d and e indicate statistical significance at p <  <dig>   of the aggressiveness which was measured by infecting  <dig> potato tubers by each of the dsl strains



discussion
this work provided new insights into the analysis of the emerging plant-pathogen d. solani. we combined illumina and pacbio technologies to determine a high quality genome sequence of d. solani  <dig> that we used as a reference to compare  <dig> other genome sequences generated by illumina technology. while previous studies reported pairwise comparison between a single d. solani genome with that of other dickeya and pectobacterium species  <cit> , this work was also based on a population genomic approach. this approach revealed the unexpected diversity of the d. solani genomes that resulted from a combination of scattered snp/indel variations as well as replacing and additive hgt events.

the majority of analyzed d. solani strains  that we called the core-population contained only  <dig> to  <dig> variants . this result is in accordance with the high ani values  that were calculated between each strain against the reference  <dig>  other studies have pointed the high homogeneity within genetic equipment of d. solani population  <cit> . all these molecular analyses support the clonal hypothesis of the d. solani population. in spite of this high homogeneity, dsl strains may exhibit some variability in aggressiveness on potato tubers  <cit> . a previous pairwise comparative study of two dsl strains did not succeed in the identification of the genes and functions that could explain the different aggressiveness trait  <cit> . however, using a population comparative approach, we pointed out that genetic and functional variations in the motility trait could contribute to an aggressiveness decrease. this observation exemplifies the powerfulness of genomic diversity analyses on field isolates for the identification of genes that modulate aggressiveness.

another important result was the characterization of a sub-group within the d. solani species, highlighting that d. solani population structure was more complex than described previously. the prototypic strain of this sub-group was dsl  <dig>  that has been isolated from potato plant showing blackleg and soft rot symptoms in france . the existence of the  <dig> sub-group was supported by ani value, mlsa, genomic architecture  and snp/indel abundance and distribution. the dsl  <dig> genome appeared as a mosaic of genes with a phylogenetic position inferred to either the d. solani core population or the dsl  <dig> sub-group. remarkably, genes that belong to the dsl  <dig> phylogenetic sub-cluster have also been discovered in the  <dig> rgts  of the strain dsl 07– <dig> that was also isolated in france. the involvement of the  <dig> sub-group as a gene resource in replacing hgt reinforced its importance in the generation of variability in d. solani isolates. the strains dsl  <dig> and 07- <dig> showed aggressiveness level similar to that of most of the studied d. solani strains, suggesting that the  <dig> sub-group is not associated to any particular aggressiveness behavior, at least on potato tubers.

this study also highlighted that additive and replacing hgt occurred in inter-species exchanges. additive hgt was observed in the strain  <dig> which acquired a plasmid from b. ambifaria ammd. b. ambifaria ammd was isolated from the rhizosphere of healthy pea plants in wisconsin  in  <dig>  <cit>  and it has been reported as very effective in controlling phytopathogenic pythium species  <cit> . moreover we discovered replacing hgt events that recruited d. dianthicola genes in the two strains dsl  <dig>  and  <dig>  isolated from ornamental plants . these exchange events between d. solani and d. dianthicola suggested that these two pathogens could coexist in the same ecological niche. in the case of pectobacterium spp., multiple species isolations from the same infected plants have been reported  <cit> . importantly, the replacing hgt events did not correlate with an aggressiveness increase in dsl  <dig> and  <dig> at least in potato tubers. however, replacing hgt generates major impact on phylogenetic inference by generating incongruities that could impair pathogen molecular diagnostics which are based on housekeeping genes. importantly, it has been reported that succeeded hgt events between distantly related bacteria mostly implicate housekeeping genes that are also the most conserved between different species  <cit> . our work revealed that in the dsl  <dig> strain, the dnaj and dnak genes, which are usually used in phylogenetic classifications  <cit> , have been recruited from d. dianthicola. since the dickeya pathogens are genetically very close , replacing hgt could be predicted to interfere recurrently with taxonomical diagnostics, hence provoking assignation errors. the impact of hgt on taxonomy has been discussed in different enterobacteriaceae  <cit> . an immediate applied recommendation from our work is that even though d. solani is mainly described as a homogeneous population, the existence of hgt events should encourage the use of multiple taxonomical markers.

CONCLUSIONS
as a conclusion, this work revealed that d. solani genomic variability may be caused by snps/indels as well as replacing and additive hgt events, including plasmid acquisition. from this work, the question arises about the dynamics of the d. solani diversity in the course of its emergence and spreading in crop cultures. this might be further investigated by a larger scale sampling and genomic analysis.
