BACKGROUND
pleuronectiformes  are a broad taxonomic group comprising  <dig> families and about  <dig> species worldwide, and some of them are of high commercial interest both in fisheries and aquaculture. senegalese sole, solea senegalensis, and atlantic halibut, hippoglossus hippoglossus, are two representative species of pleuronectidae and soleidae families, respectively. pleuronectidae  and soleidae  families include  <dig> species in  <dig> genera and  <dig> species in  <dig> genera, respectively  <cit> . all these species share in common an asymmetrical body development and a bottom-dwelling mode of life. although they possess bilateral body symmetry during the larval stages, they undergo drastic morphological and physiological changes in order to become an asymmetric benthic juvenile. senegalese sole and atlantic halibut show clear differences in the timing of larval development and metamorphosis . in atlantic halibut, hatching occurs approximately two weeks after fertilization. the yolk-sack period extends to 46– <dig> days after hatching  and the metamorphosis begins very late with the migration of the left eye about  <dig> dah, taking 2– <dig> weeks  <cit> . in contrast, senegalese sole hatches  <dig> days after fertilization and first feeding occurs at  <dig> dah. metamorphosis takes only one week between  <dig> and  <dig> dah  <cit> . in spite of the differences in the timing of metamorphosis, this process is mediated by thyroid hormones  in both species  <cit> . because of the intrinsically interesting role in development as well as the subsequent effects on characteristics such as growth, deformities or malpigmentations, which are important in aquaculture, flatfish metamorphosis has been the subject of gene expression studies using pcr-based methods  <cit> . however, adequate and reliable reference genes for accurate quantification remain to be validated.

quantitative real-time pcr has become one of the most widespread techniques for mrna gene expression analysis due to its accuracy, broad dynamic range, sensitivity and reproducibility  <cit> . although absolute and relative quantitation approaches are possible, the latter is preferred due to the normalization of sample variations using internal housekeeping genes . these hkgs act as endogenous controls that allow for the correction of experimental variations caused by pipetting errors, inhibitory compounds, reverse transcription  efficiency or quality of starting material  <cit> . traditionally, highly expressed genes such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , β-actin  or 18s ribosomal rna have been considered as putative hkgs. due to their key role in metabolism, cytoskeleton and ribosome structure, respectively, it is generally assumed that they are expressed at a constant level in different tissues, cells or experimental treatments. however, there is increasing evidence that their expression can vary during development or in response to external treatments  <cit> . in addition, some of them  possess functional paralogous genes that exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns   <cit> . as an alternative, the use of multiple internal control genes have been proposed  <cit> . different algorithms have been developed to choose the most appropriate hkg combination set  <cit> . however, candidate reference genes need to be validated under the specific experimental conditions being evaluated.

the development of large-scale genomics of senegalese sole and atlantic halibut  has made possible the availability of a large number of est sequences. we have identified commonly used reference genes in both species. twelve candidate hkgs for gene expression analysis during larval developmental in senegalese sole and atlantic halibut have been investigated. the possible use of the selected hkgs for gene expression studies in other flatfish species is discussed.

RESULTS
mrna transcription levels of potential hkgs during larval development
a total of  <dig> genes were evaluated as potential hkgs in senegalese sole and atlantic halibut. owing to the widespread use of gapdh and actb as reference genes, different paralogous genes identified in senegalese sole and atlantic halibut were included in the analysis. only actb <dig> and gapdh <dig> were considered orthologs in senegalese sole and atlantic halibut as determined by phylogenetic analysis and gene expression profile in tissues. in addition, rpl13a genes were paralogous copies between the two flatfish species. odc could not be detected in senegalese sole est libraries and thus it was only analyzed in atlantic halibut.

the ct value indicates the fractional cycle at which the fluorescence intensity equals the threshold fluorescence. ct values are inversely related with the abundance of a specific transcript in the sample and they have to be converted to a linear form by using the amplification efficiency to estimate gene expression changes. ct values of hkgs in senegalese sole ranged between  <dig>   and  <dig>   . in atlantic halibut, ct values varied between  <dig>   and  <dig>  . hprt <dig>  anxa <dig> and gst were expressed at low levels in both flatfish species . the smallest ct variation was exhibited by gapdh <dig>  and 18s rrna  in the senegalese sole and by 18s rrna , actb <dig>  and hprt <dig>  in the halibut. on the contrary, rpl13a , gapdh <dig>  and actb <dig>  showed the most variable expression levels in the sole, whereas anxa <dig>  and gapdh <dig>  were the most variable in the halibut.

the mrna expression profiles for all hkgs studied in senegalese sole and atlantic halibut during larval development are depicted in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  anxa <dig> exhibited the most pronounced variation in atlantic halibut since expression levels dropped  <dig>  cts from hatching to  <dig> dah. in senegalese sole, rpl13a showed the highest ct variation  between  <dig> and  <dig> dah.

gene expression stability analysis
expression stability for each hkg during larval development in senegalese sole and atlantic halibut was analyzed using the genorm and normfinder software. genorm  ranks hkgs according to the similarity of the expression profiles across the sample set. all investigated genes exhibited high average expression stability  values . in the senegalese sole, actb <dig>  rps <dig>  gapdh <dig>  ubq and eef1a <dig> were the most stable genes with m values lower than  <dig> . in atlantic halibut, hprt <dig>  actb <dig>  ubq, eef1a <dig>  rps <dig> and rpl13a exhibited m values lower than  <dig>  . additionally, a combined analysis to determine the most stable genes in both flatfish was carried out. in this analysis, only the putative orthologous genes in both flatfish species were included. although higher m values were observed, actb <dig>  rps <dig>  ubq and eef1a <dig> showed m values lower than  <dig> .

to determine the minimum number of hkgs necessary for an accurate normalization, a pairwise variation vn/n+ <dig> analysis was performed . if we take into account the default cut-off value of  <dig>   <cit> , geometric averaging of  <dig> genes in senegalese sole and  <dig> in atlantic halibut would be required for accurate normalization. combined analysis yielded a v2/ <dig> value of  <dig>  although the inclusion of a third reference gene reduced slightly the pairwise variation .

normfinder  ranks the best candidate hkgs according to their minimal combined inter- and intragroup expression variation  <cit> . results of normfinder analysis for our data are shown in table  <dig>  in senegalese sole, gapdh <dig>  rps <dig>  actb <dig>  eef1a <dig> and ubq appeared as the most stable genes . in atlantic halibut, rps <dig>  ubq, rpl13a, gst, hprt <dig> and eef1a <dig> showed the highest stability values . these hkg data sets agree with those obtained using genorm with slight differences in the ranking order. combined analysis showed rps <dig>  ubq and eef1a <dig> as the most stable genes 

discussion
flatfish metamorphosis is characterized by drastic morphological and physiological changes that determine the switch from a pelagic to a benthic lifestyle. during this period, erythrocyte populations and myosin light chains change to adult types  <cit> , gastric glands differentiate  <cit>  and an asymmetrical pigmentation develops  <cit> . owing to the interest of larval stages from flatfish in developmental studies and their impact on essential characteristics of interest in aquaculture , some gene expression surveys have focused on this developmental period. however, appropriate hkgs that ensure reliable and accurate mrna quantitation are required. to our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the suitability of potential hkgs for gene expression analysis in flatfish larvae. twelve potential hkgs in the pleuronectid atlantic halibut and the soleid senegalese sole were investigated. the high similarity for the most stable hkgs in spite of the differences in the timing of metamorphosis  and metamorphic stages , gives support and highlight the suitability for gene expression studies in other flatfish.

two different analytical approaches were used to study the most suitable hkgs during larval development. the pairwise comparison approach  selects the most suitable hkgs on the basis of the variation of expression ratios between hkgs expression across sample set. genes with the lowest m  values have the most stable expression  <cit> . however, the genorm algorithm is highly dependent on the assumption that none of the genes being analyzed are co-regulated. although most hkgs analyzed in this study are involved in different cellular functions, such co-regulation cannot be ruled out since some genes of the translational apparatus have been analyzed and the broad effect of ths on metabolism and flatfish metamorphosis  <cit> . hence, hkg expression data were also analyzed using a model-based approach . this methodology ranks candidate genes on the basis of the minimal inter- and intragroup variation  <cit> . both experimental approaches identified a similar hkg subset as the most stable. although only two and three genes were necessary for accurate normalization in senegalese sole and atlantic halibut, respectively, and only two in the combined analysis as determined by genorm, the inclusion of one additional gene clearly improved the pairwise variation in all cases. hence, rps <dig>  ubq and eef1a <dig>  involved in protein biosynthesis and degradation, appeared as the most suitable hkg set for accurate normalization in gene expression studies during larval development in flatfish.

three rounds of large-scale gene duplications have been identified in fish  <cit> . these duplications are responsible, at least in part, for the speciation, the adaptive radiations and the high morphological complexity of fish  <cit> . the majority of these gene duplicates are lost or silenced during evolution, and only in some instances they can either acquire new functions or divide the ancestral original functions  <cit> . several paralogous genes including pseudogenes have been described for glycolytic enzymes  <cit> , ribosomal proteins  <cit> , or elongation factor  <dig> alpha  <cit> , some of which are routinely considered as potential hkgs. our data demonstrate that expression profiles and stability vary between paralogous gene copies. gapdh <dig> exhibited higher gene stability than gapdh <dig> in senegalese sole. similarly, actb <dig> showed higher stability than actb <dig> in both species as determined both with genorm and normfinder approaches. if we compare the ranking of the two species, the rpl13a paralogous genes were ranked differentially in the two species. in contrast, actb <dig> and gapdh <dig> orthologous genes were ranked in a similar way. these data underscore the necessity for a phylogenetic analysis to demonstrate orthology in order to select the appropriate hkg in other flatfish and to make expression profiles comparable between species. in addition, the design of primers is a key point. due to the high similarity in the coding sequence between some paralogous genes, it becomes necessary to confirm that the paralog of interest is amplified by sequencing of the pcr products or by designing the primers in divergent regions of the utrs. the simultaneously cross-amplification of different paralogous genes that are differentially expressed would render a consensus expression profile that would make the comparisons among species difficult.

gapdh has been traditionally considered as a hkg due to its key role in the glycolytic pathway. however, gapdh is associated with several functions during evolution such as membrane fusion, microtubule bundling, phosphotransferase activity, nuclear rna export, dna replication and repair, apoptosis, age-related neurodegenerative disease, prostate cancer and viral pathogenesis . there is increasing evidence that the expression of this gene is modified during development, in tissues and by physiological conditions  <cit> . our expression data ranked gapdh <dig>  as an inadequate hkg in both senegalese sole and atlantic halibut. these data agree with recent findings that have demonstrated a down-regulation of gapdh <dig>  contrary to gapdh <dig>  by ths  <cit> , a key regulator of metamorphosis in the two species  <cit> . this differential regulation between both gapdh paralogous genes would explain the higher expression stability of gapdh <dig> , ranked as the best hkg by normfinder, and the inadequacy of gapdh <dig> as hkg during larval development in the two flatfishes.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that rps <dig>  eef1a <dig> and ubq genes may be good candidate reference genes for larval development studies in flatfish as selected by genorm and normfinder. however, the application of these genes to achieve an accurate normalization in gene expression studies in other species requires the identification of putative orthologous genes.
