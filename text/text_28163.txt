BACKGROUND
the capacity to respond properly to external stimuli or environmental conditions is essential for homeostasis in eukaryotes. signaling pathways, in particular those mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases , play a key role in these processes. a significant amount of research has been conducted in recent years to characterize these signal transduction pathways, based largely on the model yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae . since mapk pathways are evolutionarily conserved, insights gained from yeast contribute to a better understanding of orthologous pathways in higher organisms. the basic assembly of mapk pathways is a three-component module conserved from yeast to humans, consisting of three kinases that establish a sequential activation pathway by means of phosphorylation events  <cit> . the regulation of mapk signal transduction depends on a variety of mechanisms including scaffold proteins, subcellular localization of different elements and the action of protein phosphatases  <cit> .

in yeast, six mapk cascades have been identified that mediate the response to different stimuli:  pheromones ;  nitrogen starvation ;  hyperosmolarity ;  ste vegetative growth pathway   <cit> ;  nutrient starvation ; and  cell wall stress  . the cwi pathway is essential for maintaining cellular integrity. therefore, mutations affecting different elements of the pathway lead to cell lysis  <cit> . the maintenance of cellular integrity and morphology, as well as the protection of the cell from adverse environmental conditions, depends on the cell wall, an essential structure that has been characterized extensively in saccharomyces cerevisiae . it has three major components: an inner layer of glucans , chitin and an outer layer of mannoproteins. these components must be correctly assembled in order to build a fully functional structure  <cit> .

the essentiality of the cell wall for fungal viability makes it one of the most attractive targets for therapeutic intervention against fungal pathogens  <cit> . treatment with cell wall-perturbing agents such as the chitin-binding dyes congo red and calcofluor white or zymolyase, which degrades the β- <dig> -glucan network, elicits a cellular survival response known as "compensatory mechanism"  <cit> . this adaptive response includes changes in the yeast transcriptional program that we and other groups have characterized, not only in yeast mutants affected at different stages of cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> , but also in wild-type yeast cells growing under different conditions causing transient cell wall damage  <cit> . the compensatory response leads to, among other effects, an increase in the amount of β-glucan and chitin, the production of several cell wall proteins and changes in the cross-linking between cell wall polymers  <cit> . although several signaling pathways contribute to the regulation of cell wall remodeling in order to ensure cell integrity, the regulation of this compensatory response is controlled mainly by the mapk slt2p/mpk1p  through the cell wall integrity pathway . the cwi pathway is regulated through the cell cycle, being also activated in response to a variety of external stimuli and morphological events that cause cell wall stress, such as heat stress, hypo-osmotic shock, mating pheromones, oxidative stress, actin depolymerization, cell wall-related mutations, cell wall-stressing agents, alkaline stress and endoplasmic reticulum  stress  <cit> .

several cell membrane proteins   <cit>  act as sensors of the cwi pathway. for further intracellular transduction of the activation signal, these sensors interact with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor  rom <dig>  activating the small gtpase rho <dig>  which then activates the yeast protein kinase c . the main role of activated pkc <dig> is to trigger a mapk module. upon phosphorylation, the mapkkk bck <dig> activates a pair of redundant mapkks , which phosphorylate the mapk slt <dig>  slt <dig> is a functional homolog of human erk <dig>  <cit> , a mapk that is activated in response to both growth factors and physical and chemical stresses  <cit> . the dually phosphorylated  form of slt <dig> activates two transcription factors: the mads-box transcription factor rlm <dig>  <cit>  and sbf, a heterodimeric complex of two proteins, swi <dig> and swi <dig>  which are mainly involved in the regulation of gene expression in g1/s transition  <cit> . although rlm <dig>  activated through phosphorylation by slt <dig>  <cit> , is responsible for the transcriptional activation of the majority of the genes induced in cwi adaptation responses, a non-catalytic mechanism of transcriptional activation mediated by sbf through slt <dig> has recently been described  <cit> . this alternative mechanism extends the regulatory roles of the mapk cascade.

in accordance with the complexity of the cellular processes related to cell wall homeostasis in yeast, cross-talk between distinct mapk pathways has recently been described. this complicates the simple linear "top-down" concept of signaling pathways. for example, slt <dig> is activated in response to hyperosmotic shock through the hog <dig> mapk pathway  <cit> . similarly, our group has shown that treating yeast cells with zymolyase also activates slt <dig> in a hog <dig> pathway-dependent manner  <cit> .

considering that the cwi pathway is activated under cell wall stress, our working hypothesis is that yeast strains lacking genes functionally relevant for cell wall biogenesis or pathway regulation should present a constitutive activation of this route. in this paper, we describe the development of a genomic-wide screening in order to identify genes whose absence produces a functional constitutive activation of the cwi pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae under vegetative  growth conditions. as a result, we have identified, for the first time at genomic scale, a map of genes that could be functionally related to the cwi pathway. furthermore, this report gives new insights into the link between the magnitude of mapk activation and transcriptional induction or cell wall remodeling events. this information can be extended to pathogenic fungi, being useful for future therapeutic purposes.

RESULTS
large-scale identification of gene deletions that activate the cell wall integrity pathway in yeast
the cwi pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae, governed by the mapk slt <dig>  is triggered under conditions that compromise the integrity of the cell wall. signaling through this pathway can be monitored by taking advantage of reporters driven by rlm1-responsive promoters. we have recently developed a transcriptional reporter system, especially suitable for large-scale studies, that potentially allows detecting the functional activation of the cwi pathway  <cit> . essentially, this system is based on a plasmid construction  that includes a transcriptional fusion of the promoter region of the mlp <dig> gene, one of the main effectors of the transcriptional up-regulation response under cell wall stress, and the coding sequence of the nat <dig> gene, which encodes resistance to the antibiotic nourseothricin. in other words, the expression of nat <dig> is controlled by the mlp <dig> promoter; therefore, yeast mutants with a constitutive activation of the cwi pathway transformed with this construction should be able to grow in the presence of higher concentrations of the antibiotic than a wild-type strain.

following this approach, we have designed a large-scale screening to identify yeast deletions associated with slt2-driven transcriptional activation. to achieve this goal, we used the collection of haploid mutant strains in all non-essential genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae . as represented in figure  <dig>  we proceeded to transform this collection into a 96-well microplate format with the plasmid containing mlp1p-nat <dig>  and the transformed strains were screened for their ability to grow in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml nourseothricin. this inhibitory concentration of antibiotic was previously determined using selected mutants in which basal levels of slt <dig> activation were similar to those found in a wild-type strain . after 48- <dig> hours of growth in a selective medium,  <dig> mutant strains with hyper-resistance to nourseothricin were identified and selected for further characterization.

slt <dig> phosphorylation levels in nourseothricin-resistant mutants identified in the screening
a reliable method for monitoring signaling through the cwi pathway is to follow the activation state of the mapk slt <dig> by using commercially available antibodies that recognize the dual phosphorylation of conserved threonine and tyrosine residues within the activation loop of slt <dig>  analogous to thr202/tyr <dig> of mammalian p44/p <dig> map kinase   <cit> . in order to associate the phosphorylation status of slt <dig> to mlp <dig> up-regulation, the  <dig> deletant strains formerly selected were examined following this approach. after densitometric quantification of the phospho-slt <dig> bands obtained by western blotting analysis of the total protein extracts from each mutant strain,  <dig> mutants recorded higher phospho-slt <dig> levels  than the wild-type strain. the relative amount of phospho-slt <dig> in these mutants was distributed over a wide range of values  . representative examples of slt <dig> activation in different mutants are shown in figure  <dig>  the complete data set  for all the selected mutants is presented in additional file  <dig>  these data indicate different levels of cwi pathway activation for each mutant, suggesting that yeast cells modulate pathway activation as required by specific stimuli. remarkably, more than 20% of the mutations identified in a large-scale analysis revealing synthetic lethal interaction with slt <dig> Δ  <cit>  have also been isolated in our screening .

levels of slt <dig> phosphorylation  correspond to the fold-change in each mutant strain relative to the wild-type calculated as described in methods. representative data of at least replicated experiments are shown. functional categories and descriptions were assigned based on the information provided by the biobase knowledge library proteome. genes were grouped together on the basis of their functional category. those gene deletions that have been reported to be synthetic lethal with slt2Δ are labeled with a black dot.

as shown in table  <dig>  the functional categorization of mutants identified for constitutive slt <dig> activation revealed the most representative functional groups according to the biobase knowledge library proteome and saccharomyces genome database classifications, being those involved in cell wall organization and morphogenesis , genes of unknown function , signal transduction , transport  and transcription . the remaining functional categories comprise mutants linked to metabolism  and other cellular functions with lower representation in the screening . this distribution is consistent with putative inputs of the pathway, namely, cell wall alterations or regulatory proteins.

an analysis was conducted of predicted and known interactions between the whole set of genes identified in the screening using the string web resource   <cit> . this tool is very useful for the retrieval of an overall perspective of interacting genes/proteins. as shown in figure  <dig>  a large number of genes  showed functional interactions between them. interestingly, the interaction network was clustered again in the three main functional nodes  described above. from the large group of  <dig> mutants related to cell wall and morphogenesis, different subgroups can be highlighted. the first subgroup comprises seven genes  related to actin cytoskeleton organization. actin cytoskeleton disruption has been shown to activate the cwi pathway, probably due to the induction of cell wall stress, but the precise molecular mechanism by which slt <dig> is stimulated has not been fully established  <cit> . moreover, related to this group we found the doa <dig> deubiquitinating enzyme , which has been associated with cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton defects. in fact, doa <dig> had a synthetic genetic interaction with sla <dig>  <cit> . a second subgroup encompasses six mutants, including structural cell wall-related proteins. three of them are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins  on the cell surface: gas <dig>  which is a β- <dig> -glucanosyltransferase; ecm <dig>  which is linked to cell wall maintenance; and yps <dig>  an aspartyl protease. the corresponding deletant strains have severe cell wall defects that may explain their high basal slt <dig> activation. in fact, the compensatory response elicited in a gas1Δ strain has previously been characterized, and it involves a significant induction in mlp <dig> expression  <cit> . in agreement with this, gas1Δ and ecm33Δ mutants have previously been shown to have a constitutively high level of slt <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . moreover, within this second subgroup we found las <dig>  an er membrane protein involved in the synthesis of the gpi core structure. the absence of this protein leads to global cell wall defects. functionally linked to las <dig>  the protein arv <dig> was identified . this protein is involved in sphingolipid metabolism and has recently been related to the process of gpi synthesis and anchoring  <cit> . finally, two proteins related to chitin metabolism, chs <dig>  which is involved in chitin synthase chs <dig> activity, and chs <dig> , which is required for repairing the chitin septum during cytokinesis  <cit>  were uncovered in our screening. the identification of these mutants is significant since, due to functional redundancy and the existence of gene families, the deletion of certain individual genes encoding cell wall-related proteins does not usually lead to observable phenotypes. a third subset includes pmt1Δ, hoc1Δ and alg6Δ strains. all of them encode mannosyltransferase activities, and their selection in the screening is consistent with the finding that protein glycosylation of cell surface proteins is important for cell wall assembly  <cit> . interestingly, transcriptional responses to o- and n-glycosylation defects in yeast include the fingerprint of the cell wall damage transcriptional profile  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, mannosyltransferases are highly redundant, being included in different protein families  <cit> . the identification of the abovementioned proteins is indicative of their specific importance in cell wall homeostasis.

within the group of mutants involved in cellular signaling, we have identified several well-known negative regulators of slt <dig> activity, such as the rho <dig> gtpase activators sac <dig> and bem <dig>  and protein phosphatases sit <dig> and msg <dig>  which negatively regulate the pathway acting on pkc1p and slt2p, respectively  <cit> . we also identified rom <dig> in spite of being an activator  of the cwi pathway and the protein kinase ypk <dig>  a regulator linking sphingolipid signaling and cwi pathway  <cit> . the effect on slt <dig> activation in a rom2Δ strain has previously been described  <cit> . these authors hypothesized that rom2Δ mutants have a defective cell wall due to a decreased activity of the cwi pathway, and this alteration may triggers slt <dig> activation through rom2-independent mechanisms. the singling out of these mutants further validates our screening for discovering novel potential regulators of the cwi pathway. this is the case of nbp <dig>  ksp <dig>  fpk <dig>  mog <dig> and skn <dig>  nbp <dig> acts as a negative regulator of the hog pathway by recruiting ptc <dig> phosphatase to hog <dig>  <cit> , and has been involved in cortical er inheritance via slt <dig>  <cit> , the protein kinase ksp <dig> has recently been linked to filamentous growth in haploid yeast cells  <cit> , and fpk <dig>  regulates phospholipid membrane translocation  <cit> . skn <dig> is a multifunctional transcription factor, as reflected by its ability to partner a variety of other transcriptional regulators under different conditions. it has previously been shown that skn <dig> may be activated by rho1p in response to cell wall stress  <cit> , whereas mog1p is a protein involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. at the same time, mog <dig> is required for optimal recruitment of skn <dig> to specific gene promoters  <cit> . the fact that slt <dig> is hyperactivated in these mutants suggests novel connections between the cwi pathway and the cellular processes controlled by these elements.

regarding the set of mutants related to transcription, many of the proteins identified are involved in rna polymerase ii dependent transcription controlling responses to a variety of conditions such as, heat stress , oxidative stress  and anaerobic conditions . additionally, as visualized in the network map , there is a connection between the transcription factors skn <dig> and rox <dig>  with both participating in the transcriptional response to oxidative stress  <cit> . also, we identified two components of a module of the mediator complex , involved in the regulation of skn <dig> activity  <cit> . the appearance of these mutants in our study suggests a functional link between them and the cwi pathway. these insights enable an association to be made between this mapk pathway and additional stressful cellular events. in this regard, it is also worth to mention that some of the mutants identified in our screening have previously shown altered sensitivity to osmotic stress  or heat stress .

a connection has been described between the cwi pathway and endoplasmic reticulum  stress. when a cell encounters conditions that increase misfolded proteins, the unfolded protein response  is activated to compensate for high levels of er stress  <cit> . the slt <dig> mapk pathway is activated during er stress  <cit> , while upr is activated by signaling through the cwi pathway during cell wall stress  <cit> . moreover, a second pathway, the er stress surveillance pathway  independent of the upr, has recently been linked to slt <dig> activation  <cit> . according to our results, in some of the selected mutants these mechanisms of slt <dig> activation could be involved. in fact, emp <dig> is required for the export of specific glycoprotein cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum, sec <dig> is involved in targeting secretory proteins to er, and orm <dig> is a protein related to lipid homeostasis and protein quality control, being required for resistance to agents that induce upr  <cit> . in addition, orm <dig> interacts with slt <dig>  but the biological significance of this interaction is still unknown  <cit> . finally, we found the cne <dig> mutant to be associated with er quality control mechanisms. cne <dig> is a calnexin homologue of saccharomyces cerevisiae that may play a part in the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins.

the identification of deletant strains in genes whose function remains uncharacterized and those not previously associated to cell wall integrity, both recording an increase in slt <dig> phosphorylation, was of special interest since they could be putatively associated with cell wall construction or regulation. to further investigate this possibility, a phenotypical analysis was conducted on the  <dig> deletant strains corresponding to genes of unknown function and  <dig> without clear cell wall phenotypes reported in yeast databases. thus, the sensitivity to congo red, caspofungin, hygromycin b, caffeine and sds was determined. these compounds affect cell integrity through different modes of action, whereby the dye congo red interferes with proper cell wall assembly  <cit> , caspofungin consists of a β- <dig> -glucan synthase inhibitor, hygromycin b hypersensitivity has been associated with glycosylation defects  <cit> , sds is a detergent that affects membrane stability and also, indirectly, cell wall construction   <cit> , and caffeine is a substance that indirectly activates the cwi pathway in a tor1-dependent fashion  <cit> . eventually,  <dig> out of  <dig> strains analyzed displayed altered sensitivity in at least one of the tests described , suggesting that the activation of the cwi pathway in these mutants could be due to direct or indirect cell wall alterations. interestingly, these mutants generally had more than one phenotype supporting the existence of relevant cell wall damage. in contrast, identification of mutants without apparent cell wall defects could be related to the possibility of cwi pathway activation by other stimuli. in this regard, the coordination under specific growth conditions between the cwi and other regulatory mapk pathways has been extensively reported  <cit> . further supporting this, harrison and colleagues  <cit>  suggested that the activation of the cwi pathway by different stresses, rather than operating in a linear "top-down" manner, would provide lateral inputs that impact this regulatory pathway at different levels. moreover, recent findings connect slt <dig> mapk to dna damage responses  <cit> .

sensitivity to congo red , caspofungin , sds , caffeine  and hygromycin b  using a spot dilution assay  is shown. hypersensitivity levels are shown as the number of spot dilutions  in which no cell growth is scored. "r" refers to a resistant phenotype and "---" indicates no difference in growth relative to the wild-type strain. genes of unknown function are grouped in the upper part of the table.

differences in chitin content between mutants with slt <dig> activation
the yeast cell wall normally contains approximately 2% chitin. however, certain mutations affecting cell wall stability increase chitin levels to as much as 20% of total wall polymers  <cit> . as this emergency response for cell wall repair is dependent on cwi pathway signaling, it prompted us to assess this response in the whole group of  <dig> mutants with basal activation of the pathway. chitin content was measured by means of flow cytometry after staining the cells with the chitin-binding dye, calcofluor white . this is a reliable and sensitive method for chitin determination, since it has been established a linear relationship between fluorescence from yeast cells stained with cw measured by flow cytometry and the biochemical determination of chitin  <cit> . remarkably,  <dig>  strains contained more than twice the amount of chitin than the wild-type strain , denoting that a cell wall compensatory mechanism is triggered in these cells. as described above for slt <dig> activation, a wide range of chitin content was observed, suggesting that increased deposition of this polymer is adapted to specific cellular requirements. in some of these mutants  elevated chitin levels and genetic interactions with mutations involved in chitin synthesis have previously been described  <cit> . in contrast, the remaining  <dig> mutants did not record an evident increase in cw binding. interestingly, about half of those mutants with increased chitin levels have been related functionally to cell wall and/or morphogenesis, whereas within the group of mutants lacking significantly increased chitin deposition only 18% were assigned to this functional group. these data suggest a functional link between the chitin-related mechanism and activation of the cwi pathway by cell wall and morphogenesis alterations. eight out of ten mutants with maximum slt <dig> phosphorylation, most of them cell wall related , recorded higher chitin levels, reinforcing the idea that this polymer plays a key role in yeast for salvaging the cell under conditions that jeopardize cell integrity.

however, the identification of mutants with no significant variations in the amount of chitin indicates that cwi pathway activation could be due to alternative stimuli or internal inputs on this signaling route. in this regard, gat2Δ and lea1Δ mutants are two examples of special interest because they have strong slt <dig> activation without affecting their chitin content , despite they showed cell wall alterations. gat <dig> encodes for a poorly characterized putative zinc finger transcription factor, while lea <dig> gene product is involved in rna splicing, although its null mutation shows synthetic sick interaction with several cell wall related genes, such as chs <dig> or chs <dig>  <cit> . in order to gain further insights into the origin of pathway activation in these mutants, we decided to construct double mutants deleting rom <dig> or bck <dig> in the gat2Δ and lea1Δ backgrounds. rom <dig> is the major gef for rho <dig> that is responsible for relaying signals from cell surface to rho <dig> for its activation  <cit> , while bck <dig> is the first element of the cwi pathway mapk module. these mutants allowed us to distinguish whether the phosphorylation of slt <dig> was the result of cell wall stress sensing or otherwise took place directly through the mapk module of the route independently of upstream elements. after investigating slt <dig> phosphorylation in single  and double  mutants, it was evident that mapk activation was fully dependent on bck <dig>  whereas the lack of rom <dig> did not affect the slt <dig> activation in gat2Δ and lea1Δ strains . nevertheless, participation of other rho <dig> gefs like rom <dig> or tus <dig> can not be ruled out. this is in contrast to the activation of the cwi pathway by the cell wall stress caused by congo red, in which rom <dig> is demanded for slt <dig> activation  <cit> . these results support the notion that particular cell wall alterations could trigger specific adaptive responses through the cwi pathway.

mapk phosphorylation vs. transcriptional activation
an important aspect we wanted to address about the functioning of the cwi pathway was the association between the magnitude of slt <dig> phosphorylation and the concomitant effect on gene expression. to achieve this goal, a selected group of mutants, representing different levels of slt <dig> activation, were transformed with a reporter construction where the promoter region of the mlp <dig> gene was fused to the lacz coding sequence  and transcriptional activation was studied under standard growth conditions by measuring β-galactosidase activity. as shown in figure 6a, a good correlation between the expression levels of mlp <dig> and slt <dig> phosphorylation  was observed except for the mutant lea1Δ, in which the reporter expression was significantly lower than expected from the mapk phosphorylation status. similar results were obtained when using the cwp <dig> promoter, another reporter of the cwi pathway . in this regard, comparable behavior was recently described for the mutant msg5Δ in which slt <dig> phosphorylation is not associated with rlm1-dependent transcription  <cit> . on the basis of this observation, the existence of additional s. cerevisiae mutants with the same behavior cannot be ruled out.

in contrast to the group of mutants described above with increased levels of phospho-slt <dig>  another group of  <dig> mutants selected in the screening did not have detectable differences in slt <dig> phosphorylation with respect to the wild-type strain. in order to confirm the nourseothricin resistance of these strains, we transformed them all with the reporter construct  and carried out minimal inhibitory concentration  assays using a microdilution method. eventually,  <dig> mutant strains recorded higher antibiotic mic values than that of the wild-type , confirming the phenotype of nourseothricin resistance, whereas all the other mutants behaved the same as the wild-type strain. bearing in mind that this phenotype was also confirmed for the  <dig> mutants with increased phosphorylation of slt <dig>  this group probably includes mutants with antibiotic resistance by non-cwi-related mechanisms, such as alternative effects on mlp <dig> expression or intrinsic antibiotic resistance.

to further investigate the molecular mechanism involved in the group of antibiotic resistant strains without detectable variation in phospho-slt <dig> levels, the mlp1p-lacz reporter was used to monitor levels of expression of mlp <dig> in this set of mutants. for the majority of the mutants, mlp <dig> expression levels were low and in general higher than the wild-type strain . however, mutant strains ssd1Δ and pmt2Δ had very high levels of mlp <dig> expression  in spite of very slight, if any, slt <dig> activation . pmt <dig> catalyzes the first step in o-mannosylation of target proteins  <cit>  and ssd <dig> has been linked to cell wall integrity  <cit> . to elucidate a possible participation of the cwi pathway in the activation of the gene expression in these mutants, we proceeded to generate pmt2Δslt2Δ, pmt2Δrlm1Δ, ssd1Δslt2Δ and ssd1Δrlm1Δ double mutants. by using these strains transformed with plasmids containing transcriptional fusions of mlp <dig>  cwp <dig> and sed <dig> to lacz, we were able to delimit the requirement of the cwi mapk and its main transcription factor  for the observed transcriptional up-regulation. as shown in figure 8a, gene activation in the absence of both cwi pathway elements, slt <dig> or rlm <dig>  was completely annulled compared to pmt2Δ and ssd1Δ single mutants. these results point to the existence of situations where undetectable changes in mapk activation  give rise to remarkable consequences at gene expression levels. as further proof of the essentiality of slt <dig> activity in the transcriptional response observed in the pmt2Δ and ssd1Δ strains, we took advantage of two mutant forms of mapk slt <dig>  the first was a variant k54r, consisting of a mutation within the atp-binding site, which blocks the catalytic activity of the protein. the second one  eliminates the phosphorylation of slt <dig> by upstream mapkks mkk1/mkk <dig>  both alleles, borne on centromeric plasmids, were unable to restore mlp1p-lacz expression in pmt2Δ slt2Δ and ssd1Δ slt2Δ strains , indicating that signaling through active slt <dig> was imperative. these results sustain a mechanism of mapk signaling in which high levels of transcriptional induction through rlm <dig> are not necessarily associated with mapk phosphorylation levels. this is relevant for cwi pathway-related studies since the phosphorylation status of slt <dig> might not always reflect the real pathway outcomes. further studies will be necessary to characterize the mechanism involved.

CONCLUSIONS
the fine and specific tuning of transduction pathways to ensure yeast cell survival under adverse environmental conditions is essential. our study contributes significantly to a better understanding of how yeast cell responses to those conditions that jeopardize cell wall integrity or alter its regulation through the cwi pathway. this work has allowed us to identify, at genomic scale, a cluster of genes whose absence induces the transcriptional activation associated with the cell wall integrity compensatory mechanism. increased levels of phosphorylated mapk slt <dig> were found in a large group of these mutants, in agreement with their direct or indirect association with cell integrity. in fact, the main cluster of genes within this group is related to cell wall biogenesis, morphogenesis and signal transduction. of special interest are those genes detected by the screening that have not previously been involved in cell wall integrity, particularly those of unknown function, as well as genes related to transcription, rna and protein metabolism and transport.

although an increase in chitin content has been described as one of the effector mechanisms within the compensatory response, our results show that there is not always a correlation between activation of the cwi pathway and chitin levels. this effect is probably dependent on the stimuli involved. in fact, within the group of mutants with higher chitin levels, the functional group of genes related to cell wall and morphogenesis is overrepresented, suggesting a functional link between the activation of the chitin deposition-mediated mechanism and cell wall defects.

another aspect of interest is the lack of uniformity of the magnitude of mapk activation and the transcriptional outputs in the mutants analyzed, suggesting that their modulation could be relevant for cellular adaptation to specific circumstances. although levels of mapk activation generally correlate with transcriptional up-regulation, there are also, and unexpectedly, mutants with a transcriptional activation dependent on a functional slt <dig> mapk and the transcription factor rlm <dig>  despite not having significant levels of phospho-slt <dig>  bearing in mind that this phenomenon could take place in other circumstances, mapk pathway related studies should seek information on both mapk activation and gene expression to discover whether the pathway plays a role under specific conditions.
