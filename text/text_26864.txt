BACKGROUND
the major histocompatibility complex  consists of a cluster of genes within a genomic region which encodes molecules responsible for the expression of adaptive and innate immune responses in vertebrates  <cit> . the human mhc is the most gene-dense region of the human genome  <cit> . mammalian mhc typically comprise three regions – class i and class ii regions usually separated by a central region which is sometimes referred to as the class iii region  <cit> . in some species the class i and class ii regions are further subdivided to include an extended class i and extended class ii region respectively. the class i and class ii regions contain genes encoding glycoproteins expressed predominantly by cells of the immune system and which act as receptors for peptides derived from self and non-self antigens  <cit> .

the mhc class iii is very gene dense and contains genes of many types including the complement genes c <dig>  c <dig> and cfb, the hsp <dig> genes and genes in the tnf cytokine family. many other genes not directly associated with immune responses have also been mapped to this region  <cit> . loci within the class iii are often highly conserved and in general terms evolved prior to the class i and ii loci  <cit> .

in humans, the class iii spans approximately  <dig> kbp with a gene density of one per  <dig>  kbp  <cit> . the class iii is sparse in pseudogenes relative to the class i and ii regions, although some such as the complement c <dig>  cyp21a and tnxb pseudogenes, have been well studied in certain haplotypes  <cit> . moreover, some genes such as tnxb and cyp21b display overlaps in mrna transcription with other genes  <cit> .

the extreme polymorphism and numerous disease associations of loci within mammalian mhc have led to much research on this genomic region, including in species of economic importance such as ungulates. relative to other mammals, the sheep and cattle mhc are poorly characterized. paterson and colleagues  <cit>  have shown that the broad structure of the sheep mhc region appears to be similar to its human counterpart with a class iii separating class i and ii regions. more recently liu and colleagues  <cit>  used non-proprietary bac clones to provide a broad description of the sheep mhc and confirmed that a class iii flanked by class i and class ii regions existed which contained loci orthologous with those present in the human mhc class iii. this work proves a provisional framework for the more detailed mapping of this region.

several microsatellite loci have been mapped to the sheep mhc; microsatellites occur within the oladrb and oladrbps loci in the class ii region  <cit>  while omhc <dig>  <cit>  is a dinucleotide microsatellite within the class i region and the bfms microsatellite locus  <cit>  maps close to the cfb locus. in this report we describe an ordered bac contig map of the mhc class iii based on characterization of clones from the chori- <dig> sheep bac library identified by comparative analysis of loci typically present in the class iiis of the human and mouse mhc. a physical map covering ≈ <dig> kbp of the sheep class iii was generated together with a panel of snps. both should contribute to the identification of partial mhc haplotypes in sheep which can be used for disease association studies and to provide insights to subregions within the sheep mhc.

RESULTS
identification of bac clones containing sheep class iii mhc loci
the initial screening of the chori- <dig> sheep bac library with radiolabelled locus specific overgo probes for  <dig> putative orthologous loci that cover the entire length of the human mhc class iii identified  <dig> positive colonies. following a second screening with pcr primers of sheep origin specific for these  <dig> loci,  <dig> of the  <dig> bac clones generated amplicons of predicted sizes. ten of these bac clones were selected for further characterisation based upon both the number of loci present per clone and the availability in genbank of end sequences which anchored at least one end of the clone in a known gene. subcloning and partial sequencing of  <dig> bac clones, plus the information obtained from the end sequences of the remaining five clones, permitted the assembly of the contig map shown in figure  <dig>  this map covers ≈ <dig> kbp anchored by a clone  manifesting a 5' end sequence homologous with a human class i sequence and several classical class iii loci thereby identifying one end of the sheep class iii. another clone  contained a 3' sequence homologous with the notch <dig> gene which is close to the start of the class ii region in the human mhc.

cosmid mapping of the mhc associated complement genes in sheep
initial screening of approximately  <dig>  colonies of the cosmid library with the complement c <dig> pcut <dig> probe  at high stringency resulted in the identification of three positive clones  each of which manifested distinct fragment patterns following digestion with ecori. a terminal  <dig>  kbp ecor <dig> fragment from cosmid  <dig> . <dig>  was chosen as a probe to rescreen the library for overlapping clones which extended the chromosomal region covered by three additional cosmids that contain the sheep cfb and c <dig> loci. the contig map derived from these patterns is shown in figure  <dig> 

a southern blot of independent cosmid clones containing complement c <dig> sequence were southern blotted and hybridised with several c <dig> specific probes to ascertain the length of genomic dna . as expected, the pcut <dig> probe hybridised to all cosmid clones and identified a  <dig>  kbp dna fragment. however clone c <dig> . <dig>  contained a  <dig>  kbp c <dig> positive fragment but lacked the c <dig> positive  <dig>  kbp fragment thereby demonstrating the presence of at least two distinct c <dig> loci. clones  <dig> . <dig> and d <dig> . <dig> contained two fragments that hybridised with a pcut <dig> probe indicating that they contained both c <dig> genes. a probe generated by pcr of sheep dna and specific for the c <dig> alpha chain  <cit>  showed that the pcut <dig> positive  <dig>  kbp fragment hybridised with the c <dig> alpha chain probe. however clones  <dig> . <dig> and d <dig> . <dig> contained an additional  <dig>  kbp c <dig> alpha chain positive fragment and clone c <dig> . <dig>  contained two positive c <dig> alpha chain fragments . these data indicated the transcriptional orientation of the c <dig> gene .

hybridisation of the southern blot with the human cyp21a probe revealed the presence of two cross hybridising sheep loci. one of these was present on a  <dig>  kbp fragment at the end of cosmid  <dig> . <dig>  and therefore has a similar transcriptional orientation as the adjacent c <dig> gene. the other cyp <dig> gene is present in an  <dig>  kbp fragment in cosmids c <dig> . <dig>  and  <dig> . <dig>  which do not contain the  <dig>  kbp fragment identifying its paralogue. these results indicate that in sheep both the c <dig> and cyp <dig> loci are duplicated and that their relative order is ..cyp <dig> .c <dig> .c <dig> .cyp <dig> .

hybridisation of cosmid bf <dig> . <dig> with c <dig> and cfb specific human probes revealed the presence of both loci in this cosmid and hybridisation with a radiolabelled probe specific for the bfms microsatellite locus showed that it was located to the right of the cfb gene in this cosmid. subsequent direct sequencing of this cosmid revealed a partial sequence of sheep c <dig>  followed by a complete sequence of cfb  and a partial sequence of the rdbp gene . these loci are very close to each other with approximate intra-locus distances of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively. thus the map for this subregion is ..c <dig> .cfb..rdbp. bac clone  <dig> contains the c <dig>  cfb, sk12vl, c <dig> and cyp <dig> loci. direct sequencing showed that the bfms microsatellite locus was located within an intron in the sk12vl gene which was adjacent to a cyp <dig> gene. this information has been summarised in figure  <dig> 

detection of snps
ten of the loci that covered the predicted span of the sheep class iii  were amplified and the amplicons sequenced from genomic dna from at least five individual sheep using primers shown in table  <dig>  locus specific polymorphisms were observed and a panel of  <dig> snps was generated .

discussion
the two approaches used in this work permitted the construction of a physical map of the sheep mhc class iii region. first, a broad contig map based on analysis of bac clones was initially generated. secondly, characterisation of cosmid clones  from a sheep genomic library permitted identification and more detailed mapping of the region containing the c <dig>  cfb and c <dig> complement genes and the cyp <dig> sex steroid hydroxylase loci. in addition a panel of snps was generated representing  <dig> loci spanning the sheep mhc class iii region.

the  <dig> bacs used in this study which span ≈ <dig> kbp may represent most of the class iii region although the boundary with the class ii region remains to be confirmed by characterisation of a bac clone containing both class ii region genes and class iii loci. for example, notch  <dig> is known to be at the class ii end of the human class iii and this work therefore extends the sheep class iii beyond the  <dig> kbp reported by liu and colleagues  <cit> . the final map produced contains  <dig> loci for which the relative positions are known plus two groups of loci for which the relative position is known but for which the intragroup order of loci is not known. it is hypothesised that their order will be similar to the corresponding syntenic group in the human mhc class iii. these data show that the class iii regions of the sheep and human mhc are very similar with respect to length, location and orientation between the class i and class ii regions, and their gene composition. this result differs from the map reported by liu and colleagues  <cit>  for the cattle mhc class iii region for which the class i end contains a duplicated and inverted subregion of unknown length which places an additional c <dig> gene adjacent to the class i region. inspection of the latest version  of the cattle genome assembly  does not support the rearrangement proposed by liu and colleagues  <cit>  but does support the broad map reported in this study.

detailed analysis of cosmid clones containing the complement c <dig>  c <dig>  and cfb genes plus the cyp <dig> loci revealed a localised inversion of this sub-region such that the order of these genes in sheep is c <dig> .cfb..rdbp..sk12vl..cyp <dig> .c <dig> .c <dig> .cyp <dig> ..class ii while in the well characterised human class iii the order is c <dig> .cfb..rdbp..sk12vl..c4a..cyp21a..c4b..cyp21b..class ii. the mapping data do not show which pair of c4/cyp <dig> loci has inverted relative to the human order, although the transcription of the furthermost c <dig> locus suggests that it is the cyp <dig> and c <dig> loci closest to cfb that have transposed. additional sequencing will be required to confirm this prediction. although it is clear that the sheep has two cyp <dig> loci, it is not known if they are functional. the cosmid clones covered approximately  <dig> kbp of sheep dna and provide a detailed map of this region. interrogation of version  <dig> of the cattle genome assembly  shows that a similar local rearrangement of c <dig> and cyp <dig> loci exists in cattle, although the assembly lists three c <dig> loci whereas only two such loci were detected in sheep. this could reflect a species difference, or even an individual animal variation, since copy number variation of c <dig> loci has been observed in several mammalian species. the cosmid mapping showed the presence of the previously described bfms microsatellite locus close to the cfb locus. sequencing of a dna fragment subcloned from a bac clone  revealed that this polymorphic locus is actually located within the 5' end of the sk12vl gene which is itself ≈ <dig> bp downstream from the 3' end of the cfb gene.

dalrymple and colleagues  <cit>  constructed a virtual map of the sheep genome based largely on end sequencing of the chori- <dig> bac library used in this study, including structural comparisons and synteny with the better characterised genomes of other mammals. the virtual map published by this group for the mhc region is consistent with the mapping data determined in this study. another extensive study published recently by wu and colleagues  <cit>  utilized radiation hybrid mapping to provide a map of sheep chromosome  <dig> which includes the mhc. the partial map of the central region reported by these workers shows discrepancies with both this study and the comparative information in version  <dig> of the cattle genome assembly.

although this study shows structural similarity between the human and sheep mhc, it is known that the mhc of mammals exhibit considerable structural diversity and it is likely that further studies will show species specific differences between the class iiis of the sheep mhc and those of other species including the human mhc. the localised inversion of the c <dig> and cyp <dig> loci in sheep described in this report is one example of this type of diversity. our map is the result of analysis of dna from two male sheep . it is known that in humans there is significant haplotype diversity, especially in the complement containing subregion of the class iii region, which is believed to reflect the ancestral haplotypes and block-like structure of this genomic region  <cit> . hence it is likely that individual sheep will manifest structural diversity in this region. however this will only become apparent when analysis of snps, such as those reported in this study, are used to asses haplotype diversity.

CONCLUSIONS
this report provides a physical map covering ≈ <dig> kbp of the class iii of the sheep mhc together with a snp panel which will facilitate disease and productivity association studies and permit studies of block-like subregions within this region. the map was generated using clones from the chori- <dig> sheep bac library and from a cosmid genomic library from clontech. the sheep class iii region is remarkably similar to the human class iii, although a local inversion of the duplicated c <dig> and cyp21a/b loci relative to humans is a significant point of difference. a more extensive inverted duplication reported by lie and colleagues  <cit>  for the cattle mhc class iii was not observed in sheep. a previously described dinucleotide tandem repeat locus  has been located within an intron in the sk12vl gene.
