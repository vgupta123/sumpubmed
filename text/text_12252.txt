BACKGROUND
induced pluripotent stem cells , which are derived from somatic cells through reprogramming via several methods  <cit> , have enormous numbers of potential applications, particularly in regenerative medicine, disease modeling and drug screening  <cit> . however, safe and effective reprogramming methods remain to be described for producing high-quality ipscs  <cit> . before developing personalized stem cell therapies, genome integrity and other safety concerns of ipsc technology must be addressed  <cit> , particularly as genome stability can have profound effects on pluripotency, differentiation and the tumorigenicity of resulting ipscs  <cit> . notably, it was recently shown that the process of reprogramming somatic cells to ipscs could induce genome alterations such as copy number variation   <cit> . current evidence suggests that these reprogramming-associated cnvs could be either de novo mutations or enriched mosaic variations in donor cells  <cit> . cnvs are one of the major genetic causes of human diseases  <cit> ; therefore, it is imperative to carefully investigate possible cnv instability during somatic reprogramming before using ipscs in a clinical or therapeutic setting.

genome-wide cnv analysis is technically challenging and the cnv data need to be interpreted with caution  <cit> . to date, several genome technologies have been utilized for genomic cnv analysis  <cit> ; however, the following points need to be taken into consideration before confirming cnv instability in ipscs. firstly, technical limitations exist for identifying cnvs accurately, as the cnv calls of snp microarrays  are highly dependent on the external reference set used for the analysis  <cit> . the lack of internal references on snp microarrays can lead to low signal-to-noise ratios in the process of cnv calling whilst cnv data obtained by comparative genomic hybridization  technology are more reliable  <cit> . secondly, previous cnv calls in ipscs cannot readily distinguish between reprogramming-associated cnvs   <cit>  and pre-existing germ-line cnvs in parental cells. finally, it is still unknown whether the reported cnv instability is dependent on reprogramming methods or due to the genetic backgrounds of parental cells  <cit> , which can potentially cause method-specific or donor-specific genome instability.

considering the above concerns, we addressed the issue of cnv instability in ipscs by taking into account the following factors in our study design. mouse ipscs  were generated from the same parental donor to exclude the effect of the genetic background. various combinations of reprogramming factors and dosages were used for cnv comparison between reprogramming methods. in addition, a high-density cgh microarray assay comparing mipscs with their parental donor cells was used for genome-wide screening for the cnvs associated with cell reprogramming . intriguingly, our observations revealed the dosage effect of pluripotent factors on genome integrity during somatic reprogramming.

RESULTS
initially, we obtained  <dig> mipsc lines with the three “yamanaka” factors   <cit>  and single oct <dig>  <cit>  : eight mipsc lines obtained by o_ <dig> , the other eight lines obtained by oks_ <dig> . the dosage of each factor in these two methods was equivalent. intriguingly, we identified  <dig> cnvs in eight mipsc lines of o_ <dig>   and seven cnvs in eight lines of oks_ <dig>   . the rates of mipsc cnvs between these two reprogramming methods are obviously different, suggesting that the strength of the ipsc reprogramming has an effect on genome integrity. potentially this suggests that reduced diversity of reprogramming factors and/or reduced reprogramming dosages may induce more cnvs during somatic reprogramming.

to further investigate the possible roles of reprogramming factor diversity and/or dosage in cnv instability, we generated another three sets of mipsc lines from the same donor but using different factor combinations and low/high  dosages  : five mipsc lines obtained by o_ <dig> , ten lines obtained by oks_ <dig> , and ten lines obtained by engineered factors xyzk_ <dig>   <cit> . using cgh assay we compared the resulting mipsc genomes with their parental genomes and identified zero cnvs in five mipsc lines of o_ <dig>  ,  <dig> cnvs in ten oks_ <dig>  lines , and seven cnvs in ten xyzk_ <dig>  lines  . in total, we screened the genomes of  <dig> mipsc lines and identified  <dig> cnvs across  <dig> genomic loci of the mouse genome .

to investigate the potential mechanism involved in genome instability of mipscs, we compared the cnv rates between the various methods using the same reprogramming factor combinations with altered dosages. the mann–whitney u test with the exact significance was used for single-factor test and the anova test was used for two-factor test. by comparing the cnv numbers between o_ <dig>  and o_ <dig>  mipsc lines, we observed more cnvs in o_ <dig>  mipscs  than in o_ <dig>  mipscs . this difference is statistically significant  . similarly comparing the number of cnvs in oks_ <dig>   and oks _ <dig>  mipsc lines , although not significant  does still suggest that a low dosage of reprogramming factors may induce more cnvs than a high dosage. we also combined the cnv data in figure 3a and 3b together based on their dosages. in the low dosage group ,  <dig> cnvs were detected in  <dig> mipsc lines ; while in the high dosage group , eight cnvs were detected in  <dig> mipsc lines . a significant difference in cnv rates was observed  , which strongly supports that the dose of reprograming factors and consequently the reprogramming force can significantly affect the genome instability during reprogramming, with higher doses and stronger reprogramming providing a protective effect. notably, recent studies have reported that reprogramming factor dosage can affect the epigenetic properties of ipscs  <cit>  and increased levels of oct <dig> and klf <dig> were observed to give rise to high-quality ipscs  <cit> .

to further explore the roles of reprogramming force in cnv instability of mipscs, we compared cnv rates between diverse factor-combinations, while their total dosages remained the same. we introduced the engineered factors xyzk  due to their strong promoting capability during reprogramming  <cit> . the cnv rates are: o_ <dig>  , oks_ <dig>   and xyzk_ <dig>   . there is no significant difference between o_ <dig>  and oks_ <dig>  , however, the cnvs of xyzk_ <dig>  are significantly less than those in o_ <dig>   and those in oks_ <dig>   . particularly important was the observation that all the seven cnvs detected in xyzk_ <dig>  came from just two of the ten ipsc lines and six of those seven cnvs were in a single ipsc line. the remaining eight ipsc lines of xyzk_ <dig>  ad zero cnvs . this suggests that high-performance engineered factors xyzk are likely to help maintain the genome integrity by reducing reprogramming barriers. consistently, these observations also support that sufficient reprogramming force has a positive role in ipsc genome integrity.

discussion
mouse ipscs were first generated by retroviral transduction of four transcription factors: oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig> and c-myc  <cit> . however, reactivation of c-myc increases tumorigenicity in the chimeras, hindering clinical applications  <cit> . it was observed that the mice derived from c-myc-free ipscs showed a significantly reduced incidence of tumorigenicity compared with those derived by the four classic factors  <cit> . for the sake of high-quality ipscs generation, we excluded c-myc in our study design. considering the low-efficiency of ipscs induction without c-myc, we also utilized the optimized reprogramming culture conditions with ultra-high efficiency on ipscs generation  <cit> .

based on the reliable cgh technology, we found that reprogramming factor dosage is negatively associated with cnv rate. this result showed the possibility that sufficient reprogramming force may help maintain genome integrity during somatic reprogramming.

since the reprogramming process is an artificial process that reverses the somatic cell fate into a pluripotent state, reprogramming faces various epigenetic barriers that were set during normal differentiation  <cit> . previous evidence showed that the reprogramming process can broadly be divided into two phases: a long stochastic phase of gene activation and a shorter, hierarchical, more deterministic phase of gene activation  <cit> . the stochastic nature of the reprogramming process suggests that not genetic but epigenetic barriers can be seen as roadblocks in the journey to pluripotency  <cit> . reprogramming factors initiate transcriptional effect as well as epigenetic regulation to help re-establishing pluripotency  <cit> . moreover, some regulators or chemicals, such as jhdm1b, valporic acid and vitamin c, can overcome these epigenetic barriers and so markedly enhance reprogramming  <cit> . these observations suggest that the strength of reprogramming targeting epigenetic barriers is important for successful reprogramming. on the other hand, the ipscs derived from the stochastic reprogramming phase represent the cells experiencing greater epigenetic changes from the somatic state to a pluripotent one, which could be recognized as a kind of pressure. cnv instability investigated in this study may serve as pressure-induced factors that take part in overcoming epigenetic roadblocks. therefore, we suggest that ipscs might experience more genome instability during the reprogramming process if the strength of reprogramming is not enough. conversely, sufficient reprogramming force will lead to much fewer cnvs. nevertheless, this hypothesis should be investigated further.

in total we performed genome-wide cnv analyses on  <dig> mipsc lines derived by different reprogramming factors and/or dosages and detected  <dig> mipsc cnvs. the average cnv rate is approximately  <dig>  per mipsc line, which suggests that the cnvs associated with cell reprogramming is not frequent. the choices of appropriate reprogramming methods with sufficient reprogramming force are likely to help maintain genome integrity of ipscs.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we showed, using the cgh microarray assay to directly compare the cnv status of mipscs to their parental cells is reliable to identify cnv alterations associated with cell reprogramming. based on the genome-wide analyses of  <dig> mipsc lines derived by different methods, we suggest that increasing factor dosages, or using high-performance engineered factors  <cit> , is beneficial for the genome integrity of the resulting mipscs. our observations highlight the importance of further investigations on the mechanisms and kinetics of cell reprogramming and their effects on ipsc genome integrity.
