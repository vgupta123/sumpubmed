BACKGROUND
transcription factors are essential regulators of gene transcription and usually consist of at least two domains namely a dna-binding and an activation/repression domain, that function together to regulate the target gene expression 
 <cit> . the myb  transcription factor family is present in all eukaryotes. "oncogene" vmyb was the first myb gene identified in avian myeloblastosis virus 
 <cit> . three vmyb-related genes namely c-myb, a-myb and b-myb were subsequently identified in many vertebrates and implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis 
 <cit> . homologous genes were also identified in insects, fungi and slime molds 
 <cit> . a homolog of mammalian c-myb gene, zea mays c <dig>  involved in regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis, was the first myb gene to be characterized in plants 
 <cit> . interestingly, plants encode large number of myb genes as compared to fungi and animals 
 <cit> . myb proteins contain a myb dna-binding domain, which is approximately  <dig> amino acid residues in length, and forms a helix-turn-helix fold with three regularly spaced tryptophan residues 
 <cit> . the three-dimensional structure of the myb domain showed that the dna recognition site α-helix interacts with the major groove of dna 
 <cit> . however, amino acid sequences outside the myb domain are highly divergent. based on the number of adjacent myb repeats, myb transcription factors are classified into four major groups, namely 1r-myb, 2r-myb, 3r-myb and 4r-myb containing one, two, three and four myb repeats, respectively. in animals, r1r2r3-type myb domain proteins are predominant, while in plants, the r2r3-type myb domain proteins are more prevalent 
 <cit> . the plant r2r3-myb genes probably evolved from an r1r2r3-myb gene progenitor through loss of r <dig> repeat or from an r1myb gene through duplication of r <dig> repeat 
 <cit> .

in plants, myb transcription factors play a key role in plant development, secondary metabolism, hormone signal transduction, disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance 
 <cit> . several r2r3-myb genes are involved in regulating responses to environmental stresses such as drought, salt, and cold 
 <cit> . transgenic rice over expressing osmyb3r <dig> exhibited enhanced cold tolerance as well as increased cell mitotic index 
 <cit> . enhanced freezing stress tolerance was observed in arabidopsis over-expressing osmyb <dig> <cit> . arabidopsis atmyb <dig>  an r2r3-type myb transcription factor, regulates drought stress response by integrating aba and auxin signals 
 <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis expressing atmyb <dig> exhibited hypersensitivity to exogenous aba and improved tolerance to drought 
 <cit> , and cold stress 
 <cit> . the atmyb <dig> negatively regulated the expression of cbf genes and conferred freezing tolerance in arabidopsis 
 <cit> . other functions of mybs include control of cellular morphogenesis, regulation of secondary metabolism, meristem formation and the cell cycle regulation 
 <cit> . recent studies have shown that the myb genes are post-transcriptionally regulated by micrornas; for instance, atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> genes involved in anther or pollen development are targeted by mir <dig> family 
 <cit> .

myb tf family genes have been identified in a number of monocot and dicot plants 
 <cit> , and evolutionary relationship between rice and arabidopsis myb proteins has been reported 
 <cit> . we report here genome-wide classification of  <dig> and  <dig> myb tf family genes in rice and arabidopsis, respectively. we also analysed abiotic stress responsive and tissue specific expression pattern of the selected myb genes. to map the evolutionary relationship among myb family members, phylogenetic trees were constructed for both rice and arabidopsis myb proteins. several over- represented cis-regulatory motifs in the promoter region of the myb genes were also identified.

RESULTS
identification, classification and structural analysis of myb family members
genome-wide analysis led to the identification of  <dig> and  <dig> myb genes in rice and arabidopsis, respectively, with their mapping on different chromosomes . we used previously assigned names to the myb genes; for instance, atmyb <dig>  name was accepted for the first identified r2r <dig> myb gene; subsequently identified r2r <dig> myb genes were named as atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig>  etc. in arabidopsis 
 <cit> . we classified myb transcription factors in to four distinct groups namely “myb-related genes”, “myb-r2r3”, “myb-r1r2r3”, and “atypical myb genes” based on the presence of one, two, three and four myb repeats, respectively. our analysis revealed that the myb-r2r <dig> subfamily consisted of the highest number of myb genes, with  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total myb genes in rice and arabidopsis, respectively . in the r2r3-myb proteins, n-terminal consists of myb domains, while the regulatory c-terminal region is highly variable. presence of a single myb-like domain  in their c terminus is required for telomeric dna binding in vitro <cit> . earlier study revealed that the r2r3-myb related proteins arose after loss of the sequences encoding r <dig> in an ancestral 3r-myb gene during plant evolution 
 <cit> . in contrast, only few myb-r1r2r <dig> genes were identified in arabidopsis and rice with  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. the category “myb-related genes” usually but not always contain a single myb domain 
 <cit> . we found that “myb-related genes” represented  <dig> and  <dig> % of the total myb genes in rice and arabidopsis, respectively , and thus constituted the second largest group of myb proteins in both rice and arabidopsis. we also identified one myb protein in rice and two myb proteins in arabidopsis that contained more than three myb repeats and these belong to “atypical myb genes” group. the at1g <dig> in arabidopsis and loc_os07g <dig> in rice have five myb domains and are called as cdc5-type protein, whereas at3g <dig> of arabidopsis has four myb domains and is named as 4r-type myb . the 4r-myb proteins belong to the smallest class, which contains r1/r2-like repeats. myb genes can also be classified into several subgroups based on gene function, such as circadian clock associated <dig>  and late elongated hypocotyl , triptychon  and caprice  
 <cit> . cpc and try belong to the r3-myb group and are mainly involved in epidermal cell differentiation, together with enhancer of try and cpc <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , and trichomeless <dig> and  <dig>  
 <cit> . here, we observed that cca <dig>  cpc and lhy subgroups contain  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ‘myb-related’ tf, respectively in arabidopsis. to further understand the nature of myb proteins, their physiochemical properties were also analyzed. the myb proteins have similar grand average hydropathy  scores. kyte and doolittle 
 <cit>  proposed that higher average hydropathy score of a protein indicates physiochemical property of an integral membrane protein, while a negative score indicates soluble nature of the protein. we observed that all myb proteins in rice and arabidopsis, except at1g <dig> had a negative gravy score, suggesting that mybs are soluble proteins, a character that is necessary for transcription factors. minimum and maximum score of gravy were recorded as − <dig>   and − <dig>   in rice, and − <dig>   and  <dig>   in arabidopsis, respectively. we also calculated average isoelectric point  value. the mean pi values for myb-1r, r2r <dig> and r1r2r <dig> protein families were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in rice, and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in arabidopsis, respectively. the average molecular weight of myb-1r, r2r <dig> and r1r2r <dig> protein families were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda in rice, and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda in arabidopsis, respectively .

functional classification of myb transcription factors
myb proteins perform wide diversity of functions in plants. the r2r3-myb proteins are involved in plant specific processes, such as control of secondary metabolism or cellular morphogenesis 
 <cit> . gene ontology  analysis suggested that r2r3-myb genes, namely atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig>  atmyb5/atmyb <dig>  and atmyb <dig> may regulate cell, anther, trichome and leaf morphogenesis, respectively. likewise, r2r3-type genes, namely osmyb <dig>  osmyb <dig>  osmyb <dig>  loc_os01g <dig> and loc_os03g <dig> may regulate morphogenesis in rice. in addition to r2r3-type mybs, two myb-related genes, loc_os01g <dig> and loc_os09g <dig> may also regulate morphogenesis in rice. r2r3-type atmyb <dig> and at2g <dig>  myb-related at3g <dig>  and r1r2r3-type atmyb3r <dig> genes were identified with go function, such as n-terminal protein myristoylation, histone h <dig> acetylation, and regulation of dna endoreduplication, respectively. previous studies have shown that genes encoding 3r-myb proteins have regulatory role in cell cycle control 
 <cit> . we also found that atmyb3r <dig> may be involved in cell cycle control . go analysis of myb proteins illustrated that  <dig> % osmyb and  <dig> % atmyb were fully involved in transcription activation, while rest of the myb proteins were classified in to other go functions, such as kinase activity, protein binding, transcription repressor activity, etc. go analysis categorized rice loc_os01g <dig> as signal transducer  and transcription activator. the r2r3-type atmyb <dig> was classified into transcriptional repressor group. the atmyb <dig> expression is down regulated by exposure to uv-b light, indicating that derepression of its target genes is an important mechanism for acclimation to uv-b in arabidopsis 
 <cit> . in our study, atmyb34; a r2r3-type myb protein, has been found with catalytic-kinase as well as transcription activator molecular functions as reported earlier 
 <cit> . the atmyb <dig> is also involved in defense response against insects 
 <cit> . in consistent with previous report 
 <cit> , atmyb <dig> was found to have protein binding  as well as dna-binding functions.

the subcellular localization of myb proteins was predicted using several localization predictor softwares. the predicted locations of the myb proteins were also verified by gene ontology under keyword “go cellular component” and species-specific localization prediction tools, e.g., atsubp for arabidopsis 
 <cit>  to enhance the accuracy of prediction. consensus outcome revealed that  <dig> % osmyb and all atmyb proteins were found to be nuclear localized and confirmed by the presence of nuclear localization signal . the remaining two members of myb proteins in rice were predicted to be localized in mitochondria and plasma membrane. a complete list of functional assignment of myb genes is given in additional file 
2: table s <dig> 

gene structure and intron distribution
to understand the structural components of myb genes, their exon and intron organization was analyzed. we observed that  <dig>  osmyb and  <dig>  atmyb genes were intronless , which is in conformity with the previous analysis 
 <cit> . to identify conserved intronless myb genes, blastall  was performed between protein sequence of all the predicted intronless genes of rice and arabidopsis, and vice versa. expected cut-off value of 1e- <dig> or less was used to identify the conserved intronless genes. we found that  <dig>  and  <dig>  intronless osmyb and atmyb genes, respectively, were orthologs. other intronless myb genes that fulfilled the matching criteria, expected cut-off value of 1e- <dig> or less were referred to as paralogs. we observed that  <dig>  and  <dig>  intronless osmyb and atmyb genes, respectively, were paralogs . this analysis showed that intronless genes of rice and arabidopsis are highly conserved, and may be involved in similar regulatory functions in these plants 
 <cit> . to explore the intron density in myb genes with introns, we divided orf into three zones, namely n-terminal, central and c-terminal zones. we observed that mid region had high density of introns, i.e.,  <dig>  and  <dig> % in rice and arabidopsis, respectively. the number of introns per orf varied, with maximum of  <dig> and  <dig> introns in osmyb4r <dig> and at2g <dig>  respectively. rice loc_os01g <dig> and arabidopsis at3g <dig> genes contain shortest introns with  <dig> and 43nt, respectively. among all myb genes, loc_os08g <dig> of rice and at1g <dig> of arabidopsis contained longest intron with an intron length of  <dig> and 1621nt, respectively . in order to gain insight into exon-intron architecture, the intron positions on myb domains were investigated. in support with previous results 
 <cit> , we also noticed that a large number of rice  and arabidopsis  r2r3-type domain containing proteins have a conserved splicing pattern with three exons and two introns. however, some r2r3-type myb genes lack one intron either in r <dig> or r <dig> repeat in rice  and arabidopsis  . it has been proposed that the duplication of r <dig> in an early form of two repeat myb proteins gave rise to the r1r2r <dig> myb domains 
 <cit> . hence, we also investigated the exon-intron structure of r1r2r3-type myb proteins. we observed that 3r-myb proteins contained conserved three exons-two introns pattern in r <dig> and r <dig> and one conserved intron in r <dig> repeat in arabidopsis. similarly, in rice, three out of five 3r-myb genes have similar structure . these results indicate similar distribution of introns in myb domain in both rice and arabidopsis.

chromosomal distribution, tandem repeats and duplication
the position of all  <dig> osmyb and  <dig> atmyb genes were mapped on chromosome pseudomolecules available at msu  for rice and tair  for arabidopsis . the distribution and density of the myb genes on chromosomes were not uniform. some chromosomes and chromosomal regions have high density of the myb genes than other regions. rice chromosome  <dig> and arabidopsis chromosome  <dig> contained highest density of myb genes, i.e.  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. conversely, chromosome  <dig> of rice and chromosome  <dig> of arabidopsis contained lowest density of myb genes, i.e.  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. distribution of myb genes on chromosomes revealed that lower arm of chromosomes are rich in myb genes, i.e.  <dig> % in rice and  <dig> % in arabidopsis. distribution pattern also revealed that chromosome  <dig> in rice, and chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> in arabidopsis contained higher number of myb genes with introns, i.e.  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. intronless myb genes are absent in chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in rice, and chromosome  <dig> in arabidopsis . distribution of myb genes on chromosomal loci revealed that  <dig>  in rice and  <dig>  genes in arabidopsis were found in tandem repeats suggesting local duplication . chromosome  <dig> in rice and chromosome  <dig> in arabidopsis contained higher number of tandem repeats, i.e.  <dig> genes and showed over-representation of myb genes. three direct tandem repeats were found on chromosome  <dig>  in rice, and chromosome  <dig>  as well as chromosome  <dig>  in arabidopsis. four direct tandem repeats were also observed on chromosome  <dig>  in arabidopsis. manual inspection unraveled  <dig>  and  <dig>  homologous pairs of myb genes in rice and arabidopsis, respectively evolved due to segmental duplication. we also observed that two homologous pairs in arabidopsis contained one myb gene and other than that was not classified as myb gene in tair  databases . about  <dig>  osmyb and  <dig>  atmyb genes showed homology with multiple genes including myb genes from various locations on different chromosomes. it is widely accepted that redundant duplicated genes will be lost from the genome due to random mutation and loss of function, except when neo-or sub-functionalization occur 
 <cit> . rabinowicz et al.  suggested that gene duplications in r2r3-type myb family occurred during earlier period of evolution in land plants 
 <cit> . recently, a range of duplicated pair of myb genes in r2r3-type protein family has been identified in maize 
 <cit> . among the tandem repeat pair  in arabidopsis, atmyb <dig>  is down-regulated by aba, anoxia and cold stress, but up-regulated under drought, high temperature and salt, while atmyb <dig>  expression pattern was opposite to that of atmyb <dig>  i.e., atmyb <dig> is up-regulated in response to aba, anoxia and cold stress, but down regulated under drought, high temperature and salt stresses. similar diversification was also observed in the duplicate pair  in rice. osmyb <dig>  expressed in leaf, while loc_os02g <dig> expressed in shoot and panicle tissue. these spatial and temporal differences among different myb genes evolved by duplication indicate their functional diversification.

myb coding sequence were aligned using blast  <dig> sequences to quantitate the sequence differences between the paired genes.

the coding sequence were aligned using blast  <dig> sequences to quantitate the sequence differences between the gene pairs.

cis-motifs in the myb gene promoters
discovery of regulatory cis-elements in the promoter regions is essential to understand the spatial and temporal expression pattern of myb genes. co-expressed genes may be regulated by a common set of transcription factors, and can be detected by the occurrence of specific cis-regulatory motifs in the promoter region. hence, we analyzed the promoter regions of the drought up- and down-regulated myb genes identified from our previous microarray data experiments 
 <cit> . among the top five cis-motifs identified by this analysis, only cca <dig>  was the previously known cis-motif. although, cca <dig> cis-motif was reported as common feature of rice genome 
 <cit> , we found cca <dig> cis-motif only in genes that are down-regulated by drought stress . the cca <dig> motif was found in  <dig> % of the drought down-regulated genes in rice. furthermore, we investigated the group of r2r3-type myb genes for the discovery of gene-specific new cis-regulatory element in both rice and arabidopsis. likewise, we discovered novel cis-motifs with no description in place database, except for cca <dig> motif in rice . the cca <dig> motif was found in  <dig> % of the r2r3-type myb genes in rice. the cca <dig>  a myb-related tf, binds to cca <dig> motif and regulate circadian clock controlled expression of genes in arabidopsis 
 <cit> . to validate our prediction, we examined the diurnal or circadian clock controlled myb expression using “diurnal version  <dig> ” 
 <cit> . about  <dig>  and  <dig> % myb genes were found to be diurnal/circadian-regulated in rice and arabidopsis, respectively . noticeably, we did not find any common motif between rice and arabidopsis myb promoter regions, indicating divergence in regulatory region of myb genes between monocot and dicot species.

expression of myb genes under abiotic stresses
to identify myb genes with a potential role in abiotic stress response of plants, we analyzed the expression pattern of myb genes in response to abiotic stresses. expression of mybs genes was examined from the availability of full-length cdna  and expressed sequence tag  available at msu and dbest databases for rice and arabidopsis, respectively 
 <cit> . it was found that  <dig> osmyb genes in rice and  <dig> atmyb genes in arabidopsis had one or more representative ests. the loc_os10g <dig> and at5g <dig> gene in rice and arabidopsis had maximum number of ests, that is,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. about 70% of rice myb genes and 80% of arabidopsis myb genes appeared to be highly expressed as evident from the availability of ests for these genes . further, we assessed the expression levels of myb genes under various abiotic stresses by plantqtl-ge 
 <cit> , genevestigator 
 <cit>  and our previous microarray data experiment  with rice cv. nagina  <dig> and ir <dig> under normal and drought conditions . in our previous microarray data experiments, we found that  <dig>  myb genes were expressed in seedlings of rice , of which  <dig> genes were differentially regulated under drought stress. in ir <dig>   <dig> genes were up-regulated  and  <dig> genes were down-regulated , while in nagina  <dig>   <dig> genes were up-regulated  and  <dig> genes were down-regulated  under drought stress. the exploration of plantqtl-ge for rice mybs showed that  <dig>  osmyb genes were up-regulated under cold, drought and salt stress in rice, of which  <dig> are up-regulated under drought condition. these results suggest that large set of myb genes may have a role in drought stress response in rice. previous studies have shown that over-expression of myb genes improved abiotic stress tolerance of rice and arabidopsis 
 <cit> . in addition to these, we have identified additional myb genes that are regulated by drought and other stresses, and thus can be used as candidate genes for functional validation. the genevestigator analysis showed that  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % atmyb genes were down regulated and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % atmyb genes were up regulated in cold, drought and salt stress, respectively .

we analyzed expression patterns of  <dig> osmyb and  <dig> atmyb genes using qrt-pcr. these genes were selected based on phylogenetic analysis and one gene from each cluster was selected for expression analysis. out of the  <dig> genes examined by qrt-pcr,  <dig> osmyb genes were up-regulated  under drought stress in rice cv. nagina  <dig> . we also found that loc_os02g <dig>  loc_os12g <dig> and loc_os06g <dig> were highly up-regulated , indicating their potential role in drought stress. qrt-pcr analysis of  <dig> myb genes in arabidopsis revealed that  <dig> atmyb genes were up-regulated  and another  <dig> atmyb genes were down-regulated  under drought stress .

tissue-specific expression
in rice, a tissue breakdown of est evidence for myb genes was analyzed using the rice gene expression anatomy viewer, msu database 
 <cit> . in case of arabidopsis, tissue-specific expressions of myb genes were obtained from genevestigator tool 
 <cit> . the expression patterns of myb genes in different tissues are listed in additional file 
11: table s <dig>  the results showed that large numbers of osmyb genes  were highly expressed in the panicle, leaf and shoots . est frequency analysis suggested that osmyb genes, loc_os02g <dig>  loc_os08g <dig>  loc_os01g <dig>  loc_os02g <dig>  loc_os09g <dig>  osmyb <dig>  loc_os10g <dig> and loc_os01g <dig> are highly expressed in flower, anther, endosperm, pistil, shoot, panicle, immature seed and whole plant, respectively. in case of leaves, we observed that three myb genes, i.e., osmyb <dig>  loc_os06g <dig> and loc_os10g <dig> showed highest levels of expression. in arabidopsis, the following myb genes expressed at a very high level: atmybcdc <dig> in callus and seed; at1g <dig> in seedling and stem; at1g <dig> in root and root tip; at1g <dig> in flower, atmyb <dig> in shoot, and atmyb <dig> in pedicel and leaves. in wheat, tamyb <dig> showed high expression in root, sheath and leaf, while tamyb <dig> expression was highest in root and leaf, but at low in sheath 
 <cit> . tamyb <dig> and tamyb <dig> showed a very high sequence similarity with atmyb <dig> and osmyb <dig>  respectively. our analysis also revealed that these two mybs are highly expressed in leaf as in case of wheat. these analyses will be useful in selecting candidate genes for functional analysis of their role in a specific tissue.

evolutionary relationship
to understand the evolutionary relationship among myb family genes, phylogenetic trees were constructed using the multiple sequence alignment of myb proteins 
 <cit> . the tree revealed that tandem repeat and homologous pairs were grouped together into single clade with very strong bootstrap support . these results further support gene duplication in rice and arabidopsis during evolution which may allow functional diversification by adaptive protein structures 
 <cit> . it was also noticed that few “homologues pairs”  and “tandem repeat pairs”  were found in distinct clade, indicating that only few members had common ancestral origin that existed before the divergence of monocot and dicot. myb proteins from rice and arabidopsis with same number of myb domains were grouped into a single clade. for instance, all the mybs belonging to r1r2r <dig> family in both rice and arabidopsis were clustered into single clade. within the r2r <dig> clade, mybs from rice and arabidopsis were not found in distinct groups. these results suggest that significant expansion of r2r3-type myb genes in plants occurred before the divergence of monocots and dicots, which in agreement with the previous studies 
 <cit> . finally, we observed that two cdc5-type and one 4-repeat myb orthologs were clustered into single clade and might have been derived from an ancient paralog of widely distributed r2r <dig> myb genes.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides genome-wide comparative analysis of myb tf family gene organization, sequence diversity and expression pattern in rice and arabidopsis. structural analysis revealed that introns are highly conserved in the central region of the gene, and r2r3-type myb proteins usually have two introns at conserved positions. analysis of length and splicing of the intron/exon and their position in myb domain suggested that introns were highly conserved within the same subfamily. most of the myb genes are present as duplicate genes in both rice and arabidopsis. phylogenetic analysis of rice and arabidopsis myb proteins showed that tandem repeat and homologous pair was grouped together into single clade. consensus motif analysis of 1kb upstream region of myb gene orfs led to the identification of conserved and over-represented cis-motifs in both rice and arabidopsis. the comparative analysis of myb genes in rice and arabidopsis elucidated chromosomal location, gene structure and phylogenetic relationships, and expression analysis led to the identification of abiotic stress responsive and tissue-specific expression pattern of the selected myb genes, suggesting functional diversification. our comprehensive analyses will help design experiments for functional validation of their precise role in plant development and stress responses.
