BACKGROUND
sexual reproduction involves two main events: meiosis and fertilization, and creates new genotypes by shuffling allelic combinations. although the predominance of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes supports this innovation as a successful reproduction strategy, asexuality has evolved independently multiple times from sexual ancestors in almost all major taxa  <cit> , such as in stick insects  <cit>  and ranunculus plants  <cit> . how asexuality has evolved in sexual organisms is unclear. in aphids, asexuality was acquired once about  <dig> million years ago by a common sexual ancestor  <cit> . most aphid species alternate between sexual reproduction and asexual parthenogenetic reproduction according to seasonal variations. in spring and summer, aphids reproduce asexually by parthenogenesis and produce clonal parthenogenetic female progeny by viviparity. the autumnal shortening of the photoperiod induces the concentration of juvenile hormone  to decrease in the aphid haemolymph., and particular form of parthenogenetic female called the sexuparae are produced. sexuparae females produce sexual females and males that subsequently mate to produce overwintering eggs. although parthenogenetic viviparous females and sexual oviparous females exhibit major differences in morphology and behavior, they share the same genome. this phenomenon, called reproductive polyphenism, is an example of aphid phenotypic plasticity  <cit> .

the cellular and cytogenetic bases of reproductive polyphenism have been described for several aphid species  <cit> . in aphids, three generations are represented within one viviparous female: the mature embryos developing inside the maternal abdomen carry the first developmental stage of the third generation. this phenomenon is known as the 'telescoping of generations'  <cit> . the embryonic developments of asexual and sexual females are similar until the formation of undifferentiated germaria, which takes place at the end of germ band retraction   <cit> . the  <dig> germ cells within the germaria enter into early meiotic prophase  and a partial association between bivalents occurs  <cit> . after this stage, the embryonic development and maturation of germ cells diverge between sexual and asexual females. ancestral sexual development occurs under short photoperiod: the basal cells of germaria progress through meiosis; the sexual oocyte displays chromosome pairing, synapsis and meiotic recombinations. meiosis is blocked in first meiotic prophase until the egg is fertilized and laid. under long photoperiod, sexual oogenesis is inhibited  <cit> . the asexual oocyte ovulates in the posterior part of the germaria and forms a new follicle where it skips the first meiotic division and undergoes a single maturation division resulting in a discarded polar body and a diploid clonal oocyte. synchronous mitotic divisions follow immediately without fertilization to initiate early embryogenesis, which continues within the parthenogenetic female abdomen and progresses through a series of  <dig> developmental stages  <cit> .

we identified genes regulated in sexual and asexual aphid oogenesis by combining transcriptomic analyses and in situ hybridizations. in aphids, sexual and asexual reproduction can be analyzed in individuals possessing identical genomes. sequencing of the lsr <dig> pea aphid genome  <cit>  and the recent development of new genomic resources offer an unique opportunity to understand the molecular bases of sexual and asexual reproduction. our results demonstrate that sexual and asexual reproduction pathways require unique and shared genetic programs.

RESULTS
synchronization of sexual and asexual embryos
the development of aphid embryos under long and short photoperiods is not synchronous. however, comparing the embryonic transcriptomes produced during sexual and asexual oogenesis requires synchronized embryo development. thus, we used kinoprene  to synchronize the development of sexual and asexual embryos under otherwise identical environmental conditions. topical applications of kinoprene induces sexuparae reared under short photoperiods to produce asexual embryos instead of sexual embryos  <cit> . compared to acetone-treatment , kinoprene treatment induced complete reversion of sexual to asexual reproduction in all larvae laid during the first two days after the onset of larviposition . subsequent transcriptome comparisons were thus restricted to the five most-developed embryos dissected from synchronized kinoprene- or acetone-treated sexuparae. these embryos corresponded to the progeny laid on the first day.

differentially expressed transcripts
synchronized asexual  and sexual  embryos corresponding to embryonic developmental stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were collected from sexuparae  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h after treatment, respectively. these are the final three developmental stages in aphid embryogenesis and correspond to eye differentiation , muscle formation  and the mature embryo   <cit> . we compared the transcriptomes of these embryos using microarrays. pairwise correlations between the five biological replicates were high , indicating good reproducibility. we compiled a list of  <dig> transcripts that were statistically differentially expressed: none of these transcripts were differentially regulated at developmental stage  <dig>  only one transcript  was more abundant in asexual embryos than in sexual embryos at developmental stage  <dig>  whereas  <dig> transcripts  were differentially-regulated at developmental stage  <dig>  including orb. at this final stage, four transcripts were more abundant in sexual embryos than in asexual embryos, with fold-change  values between  <dig>  and  <dig> . twenty-nine transcripts were more abundant in asexual embryos than in sexual embryos  .

positive fold-change values indicate transcripts that were more abundant in asexual embryos. negative fold-change values indicate transcripts that were more abundant in sexual embryos.

based on gene annotation in other organisms,  <dig> functional groups were defined . seven transcripts were related to oogenesis ; five transcripts were related to post-transcriptional regulation, such as mrna polyadenylation  or mrna silencing via rna interference ; four transcripts were related to epigenetic regulation, such as histone modifications  or histone variants ; and three transcripts were assigned to cell cycle regulation . fourteen transcripts were not assigned to any functional category: among them, ten showed no similarity with characterized transcripts.

our results displayed multiple genes related to oogesis . this oogenesis signature suggests that our experimental design, using artificially-induced asexual aphids, successfully targeted genes defining asexual or sexual oogenesis within the germaria or the first ovulated oocytes of the developing embryo.

localization of regulated transcripts in sexual and asexual ovaries
we compared the localization of these differentially-expressed transcripts in the ovaries of untreated asexual and sexual aphids using whole-mount in situ hybridization , a technique that is not suitable for transcript quantification. specific antisense riboprobes were produced for  <dig> transcripts: five produced no signal , four showed ubiquitous distribution  and  <dig> transcripts were specifically expressed in germaria  and/or in oocytes. these results on untreated aphids were consistent with the microarray data from acetone- or kinoprene-treated aphids: most of the candidate genes are expressed in the ovarioles. these  <dig> transcripts were grouped based on their patterns of expression in the two types of ovaries.

the first group included nine transcripts  that showed the same localization in sexual and asexual ovaries  despite microarray results that indicated higher levels of expression in asexual embryos. for five transcripts , residual signals were observed in the developing embryo germ band .

the second group included two transcripts  that exhibited different localizations in the two types of ovaries. uhrf <dig> signal was detected in germaria and oocytes in asexual ovaries, and a weak signal was detected in sexual oocytes . orb was detected in oocytes prior to ovulation , in asexual germaria, and in unknown cellular structures located at the junction between sexual germaria and oocytes. fluorescent detection of orb riboprobes was used together with fluorescent staining of actin filaments and dna in order to define the intracellular localization of orb transcripts . in asexual ovaries, orb signals could be seen during early oogenesis, in stage  <dig>  and in stage  <dig>  . in sexual ovaries, the transcripts were detected only before ovulation at the junctions between the sexual germaria and the oocytes . according to actin staining, a group of cells is localized at the junctions between sexual germaria and oocytes, these cells may correspond to the presumptive oocytes . thus, in asexual germaria, orb transcripts were detected in oocytes but not in presumptive oocytes; whereas in sexual ovaries, these transcripts were detectable only in cells that probably corresponded to presumptive oocytes but were not detectable in mature oocytes.

the third group included five transcripts  that could be localized only in one type of ovary . these specific expression patterns were confirmed by microarray expression data for lsd <dig>  lodestar, cyclinj and acypi <dig>  the lsd <dig> riboprobe showed a strong specific signal in the germaria and oocytes of sexual ovaries. in contrast, a specific signal for lodestar, cyclin j, acypi <dig> and acypi <dig> was detected only in asexual ovaries . lodestar transcripts were restricted to the diploid oocyte after separation from the germarium . cyclin j, acypi <dig> and acypi <dig> transcripts were detected in asexual germaria and oocytes . in addition, acypi <dig> and acypi <dig> exhibited a residual signal in the germ bands of developing embryos .

discussion
by coupling quantitative transcriptomic and qualitative wish approaches, we identified  <dig> transcripts associated with the onset of divergent transcripts expression leading to the establishment of the sexual or asexual phenotype in aphids. the involvement of these candidate genes in determining the developmental direction of oogenesis is supported by: i) a strong signature of oogenesis among the regulated transcripts ; and ii) the oocyte- and/or germarial-specific localizations of  <dig> of the transcripts. these data illustrate both shared and unique regulatory patterns of transcript expression for the two modes of reproduction.

first, we identified transcript expression profiles shared by sexual and asexual oogenesis. these transcripts are expressed in sexual and asexual germaria and/or oocytes but display differences in their expression levels and/or in their localization. in various organisms, gld <dig>  bicc, pop <dig> and orb are all involved in regulating the poly tail length of maternal mrnas. this process is a common mechanism of translational control essential for progression of meiosis and axis patterning during oocyte maturation  <cit> . the regulation of poly tail length of maternal mrnas results from a balance between concomitant deadenylation  and polyadenylation   <cit> . in drosophila melanogaster, gld <dig>  bicc and orb have been described as part of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation complex that polyadenylates mrnas and activates their translation  <cit> . gld2-dependent mrna polyadenylation and translational activation have been shown to be essential for oogenic meiosis  <cit> . on the other hand, mrna deadenylation by the major deadenylation complex in drosophila, ccr4-not, which includes the deadenylases ccr <dig>  pop <dig>  and four not proteins  <cit> , promotes negative regulation of target mrnas. deadenylation of specific maternal mrnas could be involved in the precise temporal and spatial mrna localization necessary for axial patterning during oogenesis  <cit> . expression of api-gld <dig>  api-bicc, api-pop <dig> and api-orb in sexual and asexual germaria and/or in oocytes suggests that the balance between cytoplasmic polyadenylation and deadenylation in oocytes acts in the maturation of haploid as well as diploid oocytes in the pea aphid as it has been shown for other sexual organisms. moreover, expression of the oocyte-specific linkers histoneh <dig> and uhrf <dig> in asexual and sexual oocytes suggests that epigenetic regulation is involved in pea aphid oogenesis. the linker histone h <dig> interacts with dna to set-up and maintain the organization of the chromatin between the nucleosomes. histone h <dig> proteins form a complex family of related proteins that have distinct species, tissue and developmental specificities and are involved in the epigenetic control of gene expression. the replacement of a somatic linker h <dig> by an oocyte specific one  during oogenesis has been described in a wide range of species  and may promote a loosening in chromatin structure that appears to correlate with the initiation of meiosis  <cit> . the presence of api-histoneh <dig> in germaria and oocytes suggests that this oocyte-specific variant of h <dig> might be involved in both sexual and asexual oogenesis in aphid. uhrf <dig> encodes an ubiquitin-like protein that is involved in two epigenetic silencing pathways through its regulation of dna and histone methylation  <cit> . although, uhrf <dig> has not been implicated in any oogenesis process to date, our results suggest a role for this protein in asexual and sexual oogenesis in aphids. altogether, our results suggest that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and the balance between cytoplasmic mrna polyadenylation and deadenylation may have roles in regulating haploid and diploid oocyte maturation. moreover, as orb transcript is the earliest to be differentially expressed during the developmental time course, we propose that orb might play a major role in determining oocyte fate.

second, we identified one gene, lsd <dig>  that is specifically expressed in pea aphid sexual germaria and oocytes. the lsd <dig> transcript was not significantly detected either in asexual embryos according to microarray data  or in asexual ovaries according to wish. lsd <dig> encodes a protein involved in the regulation of lipid droplet storage in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . lipid droplets, like mature yolk bodies, are the major energy storage for oocytes and developing embryos in drosophila  <cit> . our results suggest that lsd <dig> is required only for sexual oogenesis during which it may be involved in yolk accumulation. the absence of lsd <dig> transcripts in asexual embryos is consistent with the absence of yolk in parthenogenetic oocytes  <cit> . thus, identification of lsd <dig> expression as a specific feature of sexual oogenesis validates the accuracy of our approach. despite the existence of genes known to be involved in meiotic recombination in the pea aphid genome  <cit> , we identified no such genes as specific markers of sexual oocytes. however, germline expression of meiotic genes such as spo <dig> was shown to be similar in sexual and asexual aphids. expression of this gene seems to be modulated between asexual and sexual aphids by alternative splicing  <cit> .

finally, we identified three transcripts that were specific to asexual oogenesis. no significant transcription signal has been observed for these genes either in sexual embryos using microarrays  or in sexual ovaries using wish. that the polypeptide encoded by acypi <dig> does not bear any similarity to a protein or protein domain of any other organism, suggests that acypi <dig> is either an orphan gene or a gene with an unusual accelerated evolution rate. in drosophila, cyclin j and lodestar are involved in sexual oogenesis and early embryogenesis  <cit> . in aphids, their expression profiles suggest that they may haveroles in asexual oogenesis only. the absence of lodestar and cyclin j transcripts from aphid sexual oocytes and embryos was particularly unexpected. three lodestar paralogs were identified within the pea aphid genome . although the three copies were represented on the microarray by copy-specific oligonucleotides, only acypi <dig> was differentially expressed in sexual and asexual embryos. localization of acypi <dig> transcripts by in situ hybridization showed that its expression was specific to asexual oocytes. however, although the sequence of the riboprobe used to locate acypi <dig> transcripts was absent from the acypi <dig> sequence, it shared 87% nucleotide identity with the unregulated paralog acypi <dig>  therefore, cross hybridization between the acypi <dig> riboprobe and acypi <dig> transcripts cannot be excluded. nevertheless, we detected no acypi <dig> expression in sexual oogenesis. this unexpected result might reflect the functional specialization of at least one of the lodestar paralogs in asexual oogenesis.

among the  <dig> transcripts found to be specifically localized in germaria and/or oocytes , lsd <dig> was the only one for which the expression level was found to be higher in sexual ovaries than in asexual ovaries according to the microarray results. this disproportion is consistent with the striking over-representation of transcripts that were upregulated in asexual embryos , as evidenced by the microarray analysis. sexual oogenesis and asexual oogenesis display major inherent differences. within embryos, the sexual oocyte nucleus remains blocked in meiosis prophase  <dig> whereas the asexual oocyte undergoes a modified but complete meiotic division immediately after ovulation  <cit> . this modified meiosis involves specific changes within the oocyte; self-organized asters are formed, that then recruit centriole precursors and pericentriolar material  <cit> . this process may be accompanied by the activation of microtubule stabilization factors or by the inactivation of microtubule destabilization factors specific to asexual oogenesis  <cit> . the predominance of genes that are upregulated in asexual embryos may be partially explained by the production of molecular components that are specifically required for asexual oogenesis but not for sexual oogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified a number of putative embryonic target genes of the signaling cascade initiated by photoperiodic cues and transduced by jh. these genes are likely to be among those that direct sexual or asexual differentiation of the developing embryos. our analysis of their expression patterns represents the first time the molecular bases of aphid sexual and asexual oogenesis have been addressed. altogether, our results showed that aphid asexual oogenesis requires the same genes as sexual oogenesis but that these two distinctive differentiation processes display specific gene expression programs.
