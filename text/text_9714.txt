BACKGROUND
foot-and-mouth disease  is a highly contagious viral disease that affects all cloven-hoofed wild and domestic animals  <cit>  and has serious socio-economic consequences  <cit> . the epidemiology of fmd in africa is unique, complex and poorly understood. seven fmdv serotypes have been defined: o, a, c, asia  <dig>  and the southern african territories   <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  of which all but asia  <dig> have occurred in most east african countries including uganda  <cit> . wildlife hosts, especially african buffalos , are believed to play an important role as reservoirs for the sat serotypes of fmdv  <cit>  and the disease is sometimes transmitted between and within different livestock and wildlife species  <cit> .

in africa, the epidemiology of fmd is complicated by the widespread movement of animals, the wide host range of the virus involving wild and domestic animal reservoirs and the presence of multiple strains and sub-strains. moreover, the spread of the disease is facilitated by the ability of the virus to survive for relatively long periods in raw meat, raw milk or outside the host  <cit> . infection of cloven-hoofed animals can result in development of a carrier state in which case fmdv may be found in such animals for more than  <dig> days after infection  <cit> , and thus may influence the epidemiology of the disease and interfere with its diagnosis and control. the duration of the carrier state can be prolonged after recovery from acute disease; in the case of cattle for up to  <dig>  years  <cit> . the epidemiology of fmd in wildlife populations has not been fully documented but it has been established that african buffalo herds can harbour the infection for up to  <dig> years  <cit> . they act as long term maintenance hosts for the sat serotypes  of fmdv with no obvious clinical disease  <cit> . other cloven-hoofed wildlife species may develop antibodies against fmd infections; however, their roles in excretion, transmission and persistence of fmdv either have not been conclusively studied or have been shown to be less important than the role of the buffalos  <cit> . in south africa, the impala  has been shown to play a potentially significant role in the propagation of fmd outbreaks between livestock and wildlife  <cit> .

fmd outbreaks are often encountered in cattle in uganda but the roles of different wild and domestic hosts in the maintenance and spread of fmdv have not been exhaustively studied. available data on seventy-three ugandan fmd outbreaks, mainly in cattle, and a few isolates from apparently healthy buffalos, indicate that between the years  <dig> and  <dig>  approximately 31% were attributed to serotype o, 26% to a, 25% to sat  <dig>  14% to sat  <dig>  3% to c and 1% to sat  <dig>  <cit> . fmdv serotypes sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> have been found in many other sub-saharan african countries, however, the viruses found in east africa seem to belong to distinct lineages  <cit> . the possible role played by the african buffalos in the epidemiology of fmdv serotypes other than sats has not been established, since only one single study in queen elizabeth national park has reported antibodies against serotypes o and a  <cit> , thus further research is required in this field.

this study was undertaken to evaluate the role of african buffalos and other wildlife species in the maintenance of different fmdv serotypes under natural conditions in selected national parks in uganda.

RESULTS
antibodies elicited against fmdv nsp
between  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> samples were collected from african buffalos and  <dig> samples were collected from other wildlife species ,  <dig> giraffe ,  <dig> common eland ,  <dig> hartebeest  and  <dig> waterbuck, ) in queen elizabeth national park , lake mburo national park , kidepo valley national park  and murchison falls national park . one hundred and seventy-six out of  <dig> buffalo samples  tested positive for antibodies against fmdv nsp , while only one of seven hartebeest samples  from among those of other wildlife species tested positive in the nsp elisa.

screening for serotype-specific antibodies using the solid phase blocking elisa 
ninety-six percent  of the buffalo samples tested were apparently positive for antibodies against more than one serotype in the screening dilution 1: <dig> in spbe. the proportion of positive samples was higher for serotypes sat  <dig>  sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and to a lesser extent serotype o, than for serotypes a, c and asia  <dig>  one hartebeest tested positive for sat  <dig>  sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig> . cross reactivity between the different serotypes is known to occur in such assays  <cit> .

titration of selected samples in relevant serotype-specific spbes
samples from qenp, mfnp and lmnp were selected for titration on the basis of positive screening results and sufficient volumes with the objective of comparison of results across multiple years. a total of  <dig> buffalo samples were titrated in the relevant serotype-specific spbes as follows; o , sat  <dig> , sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  in this study, samples with titres of ≥  <dig> were considered positive based on the highest dilution at which non-specific reactions tended to disappear and the results of a previous study  <cit> . all the sera titrated for antibodies against serotypes a, c and asia  <dig> had titres below  <dig> and were therefore considered negative , while titres of  <dig> and above were found in the majority of sera titrated for antibodies against serotypes o , sat  <dig> , sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig> . the samples positive for antibodies against fmdv serotype o were also positive for at least two of the sat serotypes. six of  <dig>  samples titrated for antibodies against all three sat serotypes as well as against serotype o were positive for all four serotypes, while  <dig>  were positive for at least two serotypes. nine of the  <dig> samples titrated for antibodies against all three sat serotypes were positive for antibodies against all  <dig> serotypes, including at least one buffalo in each of qenp, lmnp and mfnp.

isolation and identification of fmdv
three fmdv isolates were obtained in primary bovine thyroid cells from among nine buffalo probang samples collected on the same day in january  <dig> in qenp, and were identified by antigen elisa as sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig> . buf  <dig> had a higher titre of antibodies against sat  <dig>  compared to those against sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig>  , while the sera of buf  <dig> and buf  <dig> were not titrated in the spbe. following rt-pcr, the near complete genome sequences were obtained and blasted in the genbank data base. the sequencing data was entirely consistent with the antigen elisa results in terms of serotype identification. due to the limited number of full length sat serotype sequences that are available, comparative analysis of the virus sequences was restricted to the vp <dig> coding region. these sequences were compared to reference strains for the defined topotypes  <cit>  to assess the phylogenetic relationships . the sat  <dig> isolate  was most closely related  to a previous isolate obtained from a buffalo in uganda in  <dig>  belonging to the east african topotype iv . the two sat  <dig> isolates were closely related to each other  and grouped with representatives of the topotype x viruses . one of the isolates, sat 2/uga/1/ <dig> , was also related to an isolate from cattle in the neighbouring country of democratic republic of congo , while the other, sat 2/uga/2/ <dig> , was related to a previous isolate from a buffalo in uganda  with pair wise identity of  <dig> %. there were multiple amino acid differences between the sat  <dig> viruses within the g-h loop  and the c-terminal region of vp <dig> which correspond to known antigenic sites . the recent sat  <dig> buffalo isolates had some amino acid differences, within the hyper-variable regions surrounding the conserved rgd cell attachment motifs, compared to those obtained from post-outbreak slaughtered cattle in uganda in  <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
antibodies against fmdv were detected by both the ceditest® fmdv ns kit and the spbe in over 80% of screened buffalo samples. among the samples of wildlife species other than the buffalos, it was only one from a hartebeest that had detectable antibodies against fmdv. due to small sample sizes in other tested wildlife species, it is, at this stage, not possible to explain or conclude anything about the importance of these other species relative to buffalos. however, the findings of this study do relate to those of other studies done elsewhere. it has been indicated that a number of wild ruminants become persistently infected with fmdv but it is only the african buffalos that have been shown to spread the infection during the carrier state  <cit> . the situation seems to be different within the impala population in the kruger national park in south africa, where clinical fmd has been reported, and subclinical infections have been shown to occur much more regularly than previously suspected  <cit> . it is hypothesized that during the acute state of the disease some species may act as intermediaries in the transmission of fmd, mainly between buffalos and cattle  <cit> . the current findings concur with reports of very low seroprevalence of antibodies against fmdv in non-buffalo wildlife species  compared to buffalos  in eastern africa  <cit> . the ceditest® nsp elisa seemed to work well in detecting antibodies against fmdv in buffalo samples, with estimates of sensitivity and specificity at  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively  <cit> .

in this study, the majority of the buffalos were positive for antibodies against fmdv nsp during each of the sampling trips between the years  <dig> and  <dig>  this indicates that infection is almost always present in the sampled national parks. persistent infections within buffalo herds have been reported to occur in southern africa due to most calves becoming infected with the three sat serotypes, when maternal antibodies wane at 2- <dig> months of age, thereby creating an opportunity for transmitting the infection to other susceptible species  <cit> . the current findings justify the need to conduct much more in-depth age-stratified longitudinal studies to confirm the serotypes and patterns of fmd in different localities in uganda.

spbe screening results  were difficult to interpret due to the large percentage  of animals apparently testing positive for antibodies against more than one serotype. however, titrations showed that reactions in the serotype a, c and asia  <dig> antibody elisas were most likely cross-reactions. this fits well with the lack of any reports of such serotypes in wildlife in uganda, the almost complete disappearance of serotype c from the world and the fact that serotype asia  <dig> has never been reported anywhere on the african continent  <cit> .

this is the first time the spbes have been used in an unvaccinated animal population like the buffalos, which probably harbour persistent infections with multiple serotypes. for future studies in endemic conditions, sera should be screened in dilution 1: <dig>  and the spbe elisas should be improved by using more purified antigens and more recent fmdv strains representing the fmdv topotypes currently circulating in uganda for the production of reagents and positive sera, thereby possibly enhancing the specificity.

screening of samples by serotype-specific spbe worked well for selection for further titration, thereby significantly reducing the associated working time and expense. titrations demonstrated the highest antibody titres against serotypes sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> with the exception of one out of four buffalos sampled in mfnp in  <dig> that had equally high titres against serotypes o and sat  <dig> 

it is thus evident from the present study, that buffalos were exposed to the fmdv sat serotypes, and in mfnp probably also to serotype o. these findings suggest that african buffalos may play an important role as natural reservoirs of the sat serotypes of fmdv in east africa and are consistent with what has been established in southern africa  <cit> . detection of antibodies against serotype o in this study confirms previous reports of antibodies against other fmdv serotypes than the sats in buffalos in qenp  <cit> .

the distribution of serotypes varied between the national parks and between sampling trips. in this study, a large proportion of the buffalo samples had high antibody titres against more than one serotype of fmdv , and this is consistent with previous research findings  <cit> . the relative antibody prevalences found in this study  differ from those of bronsvoort et al.  <cit> , who found that antibodies against sat  <dig> were the most prevalent, followed by sat  <dig> and finally sat  <dig>  in african buffalos in eastern africa. this is likely due to spatial and temporal differences in the distribution of the infection.

three fmdv isolates consisting of one sat  <dig> from a buffalo in one herd and two sat  <dig> from buffalos in another herd were obtained from three out of nine african buffalo probang samples collected on the same day in  <dig> in qenp indicating the presence of either current or persistent infection. the three isolates were characterised using antigen elisa and by full-length sequencing. the vp <dig> coding regions of the two sat  <dig> isolates showed that these viruses belonged to the same topotype  but different lineages, with  <dig> % pair wise identity. one of the sat  <dig> isolates  was most closely related with a previous isolate  from cattle in the neighbouring country of democratic republic of congo  indicating a possibility of cross-border and wildlife-livestock transmission. the sat  <dig> sequence was closest to a representative of the topotype iv isolate obtained in  <dig> from a buffalo in uganda  with a pair wise identity of 83%. it is clear from this study that the viruses obtained are different from each other. these differences may be of particular significance during selection of strains that may be considered for vaccine manufacture and effective control of foot-and-mouth disease due to a range of viruses that may be shared between wildlife and livestock. the isolation and characterization of these viruses from buffalo confirms the presence of sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> types of fmdv as demonstrated serologically by spbes. more molecular epidemiological studies are necessary for precise elucidation of the diversity of fmdv genotypes and the possible challenges involved in matching such strains with those included in vaccines produced for use in uganda. molecular studies including the current sat  <dig> virus in this study suggest that a unique group of sat  <dig> viruses exist in uganda and, may necessitate a regional approach for effective control  <cit> .

consistent evidence of antibodies against multiple serotypes of fmdv in several ugandan national parks and the isolation of sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> in qenp in 30% of nine apparently healthy buffalos indicates that wildlife maintains fmdv infections, and thus re-affirms recent findings in buffalo sera collected during 2001- <dig>  <cit> . these findings combined with serological evidence of exposure of cattle grazing in qenp to the sat serotypes  <cit>  emphasizes the need to study fmdv isolates from these two populations to establish whether fmdv is transferred between them and at which rate.

fmdv serotype sat  <dig> was isolated from a buffalo in qenp in  <dig>  <cit>  and this study indicates that this serotype may still be present. it is not clear why outbreaks caused by serotype sat  <dig> have never been confirmed in cattle, while outbreaks of fmdv sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> are quite frequent in the region.

the findings of this study highlight the challenges involved in the diagnosis and control of fmd in endemic areas and emphasize the need for optimization of the methods used for serological diagnosis and for serotyping of fmdv outbreaks. there is need for more studies to investigate detailed epidemiology of fmd in wildlife in uganda.

CONCLUSIONS
african buffalos are important for the maintenance of fmdv within national parks of uganda. they play an important epidemiological role in the circulation of fmdv serotypes sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  and may also harbour serotype sat  <dig> and o infections.
