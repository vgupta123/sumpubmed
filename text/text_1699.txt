BACKGROUND
globally, more than  <dig> billion people from asia and other countries depend on rice  as their staple food, and by  <dig> about 60% more rice must be produced to meet the needs of the growing population  <cit> . productivity losses resulting from herbivorous insects have been estimated between 10â€“20% for major crops grown worldwide  <cit> . rice productivity is adversely impacted by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. an approximate 52% of the global production of rice is lost annually owing to the damage caused by biotic factors, of which ~21% is attributed to the attack of insect pests  <cit> . furthermore, insects are known to show widespread occurrence with wide variation in their intensity and feeding habits. insects belonging to delphacidae and cicadellidae contain a large group of sap-sucking planthoppers and leafhoppers, respectively. as such, they are difficult to control and manage, resulting in huge yield losses occurring in most of the rice growing areas. insects not only cause direct losses to the agricultural produce but also act as vectors for various plant pathogens  <cit> . three major sap-sucking pests of rice, viz., brown planthopper , green leafhopper  and whitebacked planthopper  are known to cause severe damage to the rice plant besides acting as vectors for major viral diseases.

although chemical control of insect pests is an effective option, most often it is expensive and depends mainly on the weather conditions. extensive application of chemical pesticides not only builds up resistance in insect pests but also proves deleterious to the beneficial organisms such as pollinators, nutrient cyclers and natural pest-controlling agents owing to their non-selective properties. moreover, indiscriminate usage of pesticides exerts harmful effects on the environment and human health through food chain. as such, adoption of insect resistant cultivars has been considered as the most economic and eco-friendly strategy for pest management. genetic enhancement of rice through conventional methods is often constrained by narrow gene pools besides strong barriers to crossability. in this context, transgenic technology can be adopted as an alternative approach for evolvement of insect resistant varieties by introducing exotic resistance genes into leading rice cultivars.

in recent times, successful attempts have been made to prospect for novel candidate genes that convey tangible resistance against major insect pests from various sources such as microbes, plants and animals. different versions of bacillus thuringiensis endotoxin encoding genes  have been introduced into diverse crop plants to protect against the damages caused by lepidopteran and coleopteran insects which feed by chewing  <cit> . furthermore, plants are known to serve as sources of non-bt insecticidal proteins such as lectins, protease inhibitors as well as ribosome-inactivating proteins  <cit> . however, protease inhibitors showed little success in controlling major sap-sucking pests  <cit> . recent reports provide detailed accounts on the economic, environmental and health benefits of various insect-resistant transgenic crops  <cit> .

lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that specifically recognize diverse sugar structures and thus mediate various biological processes, viz., cell-cell and host-pathogen interactions, and serum glycoprotein turnover besides innate immune responses  <cit> . lectins are known to occur in most of the organisms ranging from viruses and bacteria to plants and animals  <cit> . they represent a heterogenous group of oligomeric proteins that vary widely in size, structure and molecular organization besides constitution of combining sites with respective receptors on gut epithelial cells of insects. the possible mechanism of lectin toxicity in insects seems to involve the binding of lectin to the gut surface, leading to local lesions in the gut  <cit> . the insecticidal activity of carbohydrate-binding plant lectins against insects belonging to coleoptera, diptera, lepidoptera and homoptera have been amply investigated  <cit> .

a wide range of lectins exhibiting either mannose or mannose/glucose sugar binding affinity, including galanthus nivalis agglutinin , concanavalin a  and pisum sativum agglutinin , revealed palpable antimetabolic effects towards members of the homopteran insects both under in vitro  <cit>  as well as in planta conditions  <cit> . among the mannose-binding lectins, g. nivalis agglutinin  has been widely studied and introduced into different plants, viz., rice, wheat and tuber crops  <cit> . transgenic plants expressing gna showed significant entomotoxic effects as evidenced by insect bioassays under controlled conditions  <cit> . similarly, bioassays based on artificial-diet-feeding system, using mannose-specific lectin from allium sativum agglutinin , showed antimetabolic effects towards bph and glh insects  <cit> . expression of garlic lectins, asal and asa-ii in tobacco conferred resistance against tobacco aphid and cotton leaf worm, respectively  <cit> . saha et al.  <cit>  reported that transgenic rice lines expressing garlic lectin gene  exhibit increased resistance against glh and bph pests. in three subspecies of rice, significant advances made in the regeneration protocols and gene delivery methods have facilitated introduction of beneficial genes for various agronomic traits. in the recent past, it has been established that agrobacterium-mediated transformation is an efficacious method for transferring novel candidate genes into elite indica rice varieties  <cit> .

the present investigation deals with the isolation, cloning and characterization of lectin  gene from a. sativum, and its expression in elite indica rice cultivars using agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation method. molecular evidences suggest stable integration of asal and bar genes into the genomes of rice plants, and their variable expression at rna and protein levels. the stable transgenic lines, expressing asal, showed explicit resistance against major sap-sucking insects, viz., bph, glh and wbph.

RESULTS
the observations described herein pertain to the isolation of asal gene from garlic plants and its overexpression in two elite indica rice cultivars. the presence and expression of transgenes  in rice plants has been demonstrated through southern, northern and western analyses. the various asal-expressing rice lines furnished marked resistance against three major sap-sucking pests, viz., bph, glh and wbph.

isolation of a. sativum agglutinin gene  and construction of psb111-bar-asal plant expression vector
coding sequence of the asal was isolated from garlic plants through the synthesis of cdna followed by pcr using gene specific primers. the pcr product contained  <dig> bp coding sequence  that codes for a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids , containing a signal peptide of  <dig> a.a. the asal protein showed maximum identity of 98% with the mannose specific lectins isolated from the leaf  and bulbs  of garlic plants. the plant expression cassette, comprising camv35s promoter, asal and nos terminator, was cloned at hindiii site of psb <dig> bar intermediate vector of the agrobacterium containing bar gene expression cassette . the recombinant clone was then introduced into agrobacterium strain lba <dig> by triparental mating and the resultant super-binary vector was designated as psb111-bar-asal .

genetic transformation and production of transgenic rice plants
to insert asal gene into rice plants, embryogenic calli of rice  was co-cultivated with the agrobacterium strain lba <dig> harbouring ti-plasmid psb111-bar-asal. a total number of  <dig> and  <dig> putative transformants were obtained from  <dig> calli of chaitanya and  <dig> calli of bpt <dig>  respectively. from these,  <dig> transformants of chaitanya and  <dig> of bpt <dig> were selected for further analyses based on their high tolerance to herbicide  basta .

molecular analysis of primary  transgenic plants
genomic dna was isolated from the basta tolerant transgenic rice plants as well as from the untransformed control plants. pcr analysis of transgenic rice plants showed amplification of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp products, representing bar and asal coding sequences, while control plants failed to show such amplification . southern blot analysis was carried out using basta and pcr positive plants. when genomic dna of transgenic plants was digested with hindiii and probed with asal coding sequence, it showed hybridizable band of ~ <dig>  kb . similarly, ecori digested dna of transgenics probed with bar sequence showed ~ <dig>  kb band . genomic dna of different transgenic plants, digested with ecori and probed with the asal, showed a distinct hybridizable band of > <dig> kb . these bands correspond to the expression units of bar and asal transgenes introduced into the transgenic rice plants. conversely, the untransformed control plants failed to show any hybridizable band with both the probes. northern blot analysis was performed using the rna from southern positive plants to assess the expression of asal gene in different transgenic rice lines; presence of a > <dig> bp hybridizable band of varied intensity was visualized in diverse transgenic lines . western blot analysis of leaf extracts from transgenic plants showed the presence of a polypeptide of > <dig> kda corresponding to the purified asal protein when treated with anti-asal antibodies . whereas, no such protein was observed in the untransformed control plants. the level of asal expression in transgenic plants was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , and the amount of asal among transformants ranged between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total soluble proteins.

inheritance pattern of asal and bar genes in t <dig> generation
to investigate the inheritance pattern of the transgenes, selfed seed collected from the primary  transformants were germinated and t <dig> progenies were grown to maturity in the glass house. eight t1lines of chaitanya, viz., t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  and three t <dig> lines of bpt <dig>  viz., t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  were tested with the herbicide basta and were also subjected to insect bioassays. in t <dig> progenies, both the transgenes bar and asal showed a monogenic segregation of  <dig> resistant:  <dig> susceptible plant besides co-segregation in a normal mendelian fashion for basta tolerance as well as for insect resistance . these transgenic lines were healthy and were found similar to that of untransformed control plants for various morphological characters with normal seed fertility.

impact of asal on bph, glh and wbph pests
comprehensive in planta bioassay experiments were performed to test the insecticidal activity of the asal gene, on t <dig> and t <dig>  transgenic lines, for three major sap-sucking pests of rice. transgenic rice lines  expressing asal showed significant resistance towards bph, glh and wbph insects with minimal plant damage . transgenic plants exhibited varied levels  of resistance to bph, glh and wbph on a par with those of bph-resistant var. ptb <dig>  glh resistant var. vikramarya and wbph resistant var. mo- <dig>  respectively. on the other hand, susceptible var. tn- <dig> and untransformed control plants showed complete damage  caused by these insects . among eight t <dig> transgenic lines tested, two lines t <dig> and t <dig> of chaitanya, and t <dig> of bpt <dig>  showed higher levels of resistance when compared to all other transgenic lines. the selected transgenic lines were further subjected to insect bioassays for mortality, developmental delay, fecundity and feeding behaviour of insects. asal-plants from selected lines, infested with bph/glh/wbph nymphs, survived the infestation and could grow to maturity with normal seed set. the survival of bph, glh and wbph nymphs fed on transgenic rice plants was reduced by ~74â€“ 83%, ~79â€“84% and ~64â€“77%, respectively, as compared to that of susceptible control plants . during the entire 24-day bioassay period, the survival of bph on transgenic rice plants was significantly reduced to  <dig>  Â±  <dig> ,  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  insects/plant on t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> lines, respectively, compared to  <dig>  Â±  <dig> , and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  insects/plant on untransformed control plants . likewise, the survival of glh on transgenic rice was significantly reduced to  <dig>  Â±  <dig> ,  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  insects/plant on t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> lines, respectively, compared to  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  insects/plant on control plants . the survival of wbph fed on transgenic plants was also reduced to  <dig>  Â±  <dig> ,  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  insects/plant on t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> lines, respectively, in comparison with  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  insects observed on control plants .

entomotoxic effects of asal on sap-sucking pests
first instar nymphs of bph, glh and wbph were released onto transgenic and control rice plants and were monitored for the effect of asal on their growth and development. insects fed on transgenic plants revealed ~ <dig> to  <dig> days delay for reaching adulthood, as compared to the insects fed on untransformed control plants. among bph survivors,  <dig> to 27% could reach the adult stage on different transgenic lines, compared to  <dig> to 90% adults observed on control plants . from glh survivors, only  <dig> to 15% could reach the adult stage on transgenic lines while  <dig> to 90% adults were found on control plants . in case of wbph survivors,  <dig> to 30% could develop into adults on transgenics compared to  <dig> to 82% adults on control plants .

effect of asal on the fecundity of bph, glh and wbph was assessed by estimating the total number of nymphs produced by the insects fed on transgenic rice plants. a mean number of  <dig> Â±  <dig> ,  <dig> Â±  <dig>  and  <dig> Â±  <dig>  bph nymphs/plant were recorded on t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> plants compared to  <dig> Â±  <dig>  and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  nymphs/plant on untransformed controls . in case of glh, a mean number of  <dig> Â±  <dig> ,  <dig> Â±  <dig>  and  <dig> Â±  <dig>  nymphs/plant were observed on t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> plants in comparison with  <dig> Â±  <dig>  and  <dig> Â±  <dig>  nymphs/plant on controls . similarly, for wbph a mean number of  <dig> Â±  <dig> ,  <dig> Â±  <dig>  and  <dig> Â±  <dig>  nymphs/plant were noticed on t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> plants as compared to  <dig> Â±  <dig>  and  <dig> Â±  <dig>  nymphs/plant produced on untransformed controls .

effect of asal on the feeding behaviour of bph, glh and wbph insects
the feeding ability of insects was assessed based on the amount of honeydew excreted by the insects. after a lapse of  <dig> h of feeding on transgenic rice/untransformed control plants, the number of honeydew units  developed on the bromocresol green paper was counted to estimate the feeding capacity of the insects. a mean number of ~ <dig> Â±  <dig> , ~ <dig> Â±  <dig>  and ~ <dig> Â±  <dig>  honeydew units/plant were excreted by bph, glh and wbph, respectively, when fed on different transgenic rice plants compared to ~ <dig> Â±  <dig> , ~ <dig> Â±  <dig>  and ~ <dig> Â±  <dig>  honeydew units/plant observed on control plants . honeydew assay revealed significant reductions of ~ <dig> to 94% and ~ <dig> to 83% and ~60â€“68% in the feeding ability of bph, glh and wbph, respectively, on transgenic plants as compared to the insects fed on control plants .

discussion
in our ongoing efforts to clone and introduce different plant lectin genes into rice genome against homopteran pests, we have been evaluating the potential usefulness of a. sativum agglutinin  gene to provide resistance against major sap-sucking insects of rice, viz., bph, glh and wbph which cause severe damage to rice plant affecting crop productivity. earlier, we reported that transgenic rice engineered with the gna gene from g. nivalis could confer substantial resistance against major sap sucking pests  <cit> . an approximate 14% of the global cereal crop production is lost annually by the infestation of diverse insects. among major cereals, about 83% of rice, 52% of wheat and 59% of maize crop production are lost owing to the damages caused by insect pests  <cit> . it has been estimated that > <dig> million tons of rice are being lost annually due to pests, despite intensive applications of chemical sprays to combat the menace  <cit> . damages caused to various crops by sucking pests have become a serious concern, as they are difficult to control owing to their unique feeding strategy. furthermore, after the introduction of bt genes into various crops, the damages caused by sucking pests steadily increased as they failed to convey resistance against these pests. several plant lectins have proved insecticidal against a wide array of pests belonging to lepidoptera, coleoptera, diptera and homoptera  <cit> . this study deals with the isolation of a. sativum lectin gene  and its constitutive expression in two high-yielding indica rice cultivars. further, strong entomotoxic effects of asal transgenics against major sap-sucking pests has been demonstrated employing standard screening techniques that reflect situations prevailing in the field.

the deduced amino acid sequence of asal protein disclosed maximum similarity  with that of previously reported garlic lectin protein  <cit> . employing the protocols optimized in our laboratory, the co-integrated super-binary vector psb111-bar-asal has been used to transform the elite indica rice cultivars. pcr and southern analyses of basta tolerant plants confirmed the stable integration of bar and asal genes into the indica rice genome. presence of ~ <dig>  kb hybridizable band with the asal probe in hindiii digested dna, and ~ <dig>  kb hybridizable band with the bar probe in ecori digested dna of transformants indicate the existence of two intact expression units of bar and asal in the rice genome . similarly, ecori digested genomic dna, when probed with asal, revealed a specific hybridizable band of > <dig>  kb in different transformants , thereby suggesting the independent nature of transgene integration in primary transformants. these observations further suggest that the t-dna is integrated into rice genome as a single copy without any rearrangement. it has been established that multiple copies of transgene often result in co-suppression and gene silencing  <cit> . single copy integration of transgene is essential to achieve predictable patterns of inheritance and to eliminate the problem of gene silencing in transgenic plants  <cit> . moreover, an inverse co-relation has been found between transgene copy number and their expression levels  <cit> . northern blot analysis clearly showed the variable expression of asal gene in the primary transgenic plants as evidenced by varied intensity of the hybridizable band of > <dig> bp . western blot analyses of transgenic plants confirmed the stable expression of the asal gene at the protein level . marked variation observed in the amount of asal , in different transformants by elisa analysis, amply suggests that the transgene is integrated randomly at different transcriptionally active sites in the rice genome. the amount of asal expressed in different transgenic plants is distinctly higher as compared to the expression levels of gna  <cit>  and asal  <cit>  proteins reported earlier.

to establish the definitive transgenic nature of primary transformants, the inheritance pattern of transgenes was analyzed in the t <dig> generation. basta test and southern analysis indicated that bar and asal are transmitted in a mendelian fashion. segregation analyses of transgenes in t <dig> progenies revealed a monogenic ratio of  <dig> resistant:  <dig> susceptible plant for both herbicide tolerance and insect resistance, affirming that these genes are stably integrated into the rice genome . the co-segregation of transgenes further confirms that both bar and asal are integrated and manifest as a single locus.

in planta insect bioassays amply indicate that expression of asal in transgenic rice lines imparts substantial resistance against bph, glh and wbph insects, as evidenced by decreased insect feeding and declined insect survival, thereby minimizing the damage caused by hopperburn. the t <dig> progenies of eight independent homozygous transgenic lines , subjected to insect bioassays, exhibited high-level resistance , testifying that asal affords ample protection against sap-sucking insects. the 1st instar bph/glh/wbph nymphs, when fed on selected t <dig> transgenic lines, viz., t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  expressing  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % asal, respectively, disclosed ~50% mortality within 10â€“ <dig> days of infestation . after  <dig> days of infestation, insects surviving on transgenic plants varied from  <dig> to 4/plant  which exhibited delayed moulting and prolonged life cycle  as compared to the insects present on susceptible control plants. the survival of bph was reduced by ~74% on chaitanya transgenic lines and ~83% on bpt <dig> transgenic lines compared to the control plants . similarly, glh survival was decreased by ~79% on chaitanya transgenic lines and ~84% on bpt <dig> transgenic lines when compared to the controls . however, the survival of wbph was declined by ~64% on chaitanya transgenic lines and ~77% on bpt <dig> transgenic lines in comparison with susceptible control plants . the accrued results amply indicate that the asal expressing transgenic rice exhibit a distinctly higher-level of resistance against both bph and glh pests as compared to that of gna  <cit>  and asal  <cit>  expressing rice lines. it was reported that overexpression of asal and gna in rice reduced the survival of bph by 36%  <cit>  and 32% to 59%, respectively  <cit> . similarly, the glh survival was decreased by 49% to 53% on gna transgenics  <cit>  and by 32% on asal expressing plants  <cit> . whereas, wbph nymphs fed on asal transgenic rice showed ~64â€“77% mortality as compared to 90% mortality observed on gna transgenics  <cit> . furthermore, fecundity assays conducted on asal rice lines revealed significant decline in the nymphal production of bph, glh and wbph insects by ~68%, ~73% and ~67% on chaitanya transgenic lines and ~64%, ~65% and ~64% on bpt <dig> transgenic plants, respectively , indicating marked decreases in the fecundity of bph, glh and wbph insects. these results suggest the high antifeedant and entomotoxic effects of asal on these insects. a clear correlation has been observed between the amount of garlic lectin in transgenic plants and its entomotoxic effects on three sap-sucking insects. earlier, it was reported that bph and glh nymphal production was reduced by 59% and  <dig> % when fed on asal expressing transgenic rice  <cit> . however, transgenic rice expressing gna showed a striking decrease in the fecundity  of wbph  <cit>  as compared to the asal transgenics  employed in this study. also, marked decreases of ~ <dig> to 94% and ~ <dig> to 83% were observed in the honeydew production of bph and glh insects, respectively, when fed on asal transgenic plants , compared to the honeydew produced by the insects fed on gna transgenics  <cit> . conversely, gna transgenics showed ~90% reduction in the honeydew production of wbph  <cit>  compared to ~60â€“68% reduction observed on asal transgenics. an overview of insect bioassays amply establish that asal is more toxic to both bph and glh insects compared to gna; whereas, gna showed higher toxicity to the wbph than asal under similar bioassay conditions. the variable entomotoxic effects of gna and asal on three sap-sucking pests may be attributed to their differential binding affinities to receptor proteins on gut epithelial cells of the insects. as it is imperative to identify eco-friendly and potent insecticidal proteins, the asal may be preferred for genetic engineering of diverse crops against sucking pests. the overall results of in planta insect bioassays establish that asal transgenic rice plants could express functionally active asal protein, which is comparable to the native form of garlic lectin used in artificial diet bioassays against sucking insects  <cit> .

although the precise mechanism of lectin toxicity to insects is unclear, yet it probably involves binding of lectins to the receptors present on the gut epithelial cells of various insects  <cit> . immunohistochemical studies of a wide range of mannose or mannose/glucose specific lectins such as gna, con a and psa suggest the binding to the midgut epithelial cells of insects thereby contributing to the insecticidal effect  <cit> . furthermore, the bound lectins might inhibit the absorption of nutrients or disrupt the midgut cells through endocytosis of lectin and other toxic metabolites  <cit> . the toxicity of mannose binding lectins towards sucking insects is not clear, but it has been shown to bind to the mannose moiety of brush border membrane vesicle  receptors of gut epithelial cells, thereby causing disruption of cell function and mortality  <cit> . banerjee et al.  <cit> , using ligand blot analysis of the mustard aphid , demonstrated that asal protein binds to symbionin  receptor involved in the transmission of viruses by sucking pests.

CONCLUSIONS
in planta insect bioassays, reported herein, were carried out on asal transgenic rice lines adopting standard screening techniques followed in the conventional rice breeding for selection of insect resistant plants. the asal expressing plants, bestowed with high antifeedant and antimetabolic effects, afforded high-level resistance against three major sap-sucking insects. t <dig> transgenic lines of chaitanya and bpt <dig> varieties are being evaluated in limited open-field trials in the hopper-prone areas. to our knowledge, none of the rice cultivars thus far developed by conventional methods could show worthwhile resistance against three major sap-sucking pests. the overall results amply indicate that asal transgenic rice lines exhibit surpassing resistance against bph, glh and wbph insects. the prototypic transgenic rice harbouring exotic asal appear promising for direct commercial cultivation besides serving as a novel genetic resource in recombination breeding.
