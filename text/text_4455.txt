BACKGROUND
xylans are major hemicellulose component of plant cell wall, usually accounting for 20%–30% of their total dry mass. as they are the second most abundant natural polysaccharide after cellulose, complete degradation of them could generate various forms of cellulosic biomass and allow utilization of such low-cost raw materials for industrial applications  <cit> . xylans have a relatively complex structure based on a non-branched β- <dig> -glycosidically linked xylose backbone. depending on the origin, the backbone structure is substituted to various degrees with acetyl, l-arabinofuranosyl, glucuronyl and 4-o-methylglucuronyl groups  <cit> . complete degradation of xylans requires the synergistic action of several enzymes of which ec <dig> . <dig> -endo-beta- <dig>  4-xylanases are the crucial enzymes for depolymerization  <cit> . in recent years, xylanses have attracted considerable research interest because of their potential industrial application, such as in biobleaching, paper making and in the food and animal feed industries  <cit> . various microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi were found to naturally secreted xylanases.

the trichoderma species has long been shown to secrete large amounts of efficient xylan-degrading enzymes, which render it an attractive microorganism for industrial enzyme production. the two major endo-xylanases secreted by this fungus are xyn <dig> and xyn <dig>  xyn <dig> has an acidic pi , possesses a smaller, tighter groove than xyn <dig>  and a lower ph optimum  <cit> . xyn <dig> has a basic pi  and a wider ph range. both xyn <dig> and xyn <dig> produce similar hydrolysis end products. however, xyn <dig> represents more than 50% of the total xylanolytic activity of this fungus and tends to produce larger oligosaccharides  <cit> . today, the recombinant production hosts are preferred  <cit> . the recombinant production in fungal hosts, such as trichoderma reesei, is not without problems, since they produce many enzymes at the same time. although expression of some major enzymes  has been knocked out, they still produce other enzymes that in certain applications can be problem  <cit> .

thus, production systems, in which a minimal amount of interfering side activities are produced, is desired. xylanases can be produced in secreted form from e. coli, however, the production level is very low.  <cit> . the yeast pichia pastoris can neither utilize nor degrade xylan, but it possesses many attributes that render it an attractive host for the expression and production of xylanases. as a eukaryote, pichia pastoris has many of the advantages of higher eukaryotic expression systems such as protein processing, protein folding, and posttranslational modification, while being as easy to manipulate as e. coli or saccharomyces cerevisiae. it is faster, easier, and less expensive to use than baculovirus or mammalian expression systems, and generally gives higher expression levels. as a yeast, it shares the advantages of molecular and genetic manipulations with s. cerevisiae and has the added advantage of  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher heterologous protein expression levels  <cit> . these features make pichia very useful as a protein expression system.

in this study, we describe the molecular cloning of the t. reesei xyn <dig> gene in p. pastoris. expression of the xyn <dig> gene in p. pastoris was obtained with the aid of multicopy plasmids, using the strong p. pastoris promoter-terminator expression cassettes derived from the inducible alcohol oxidase <dig>  gene. in addition, the enzymatic properties of the recombinant xylanase were characterized.

RESULTS
cloning of the t. reesei xyn <dig> gene
the mature xyn <dig> gene was prepared from first-strand cdna prepared from t. reesei rut c- <dig> by using sequence-specific pcr primers. thus a fragment of  <dig> bp of xyn <dig> gene was obtained and sequenced . the calculated molecular mass  is in good agreement with the molecular mass of native xyn <dig> isolated from t. reesei  <cit> . the t. reesei rut c- <dig> xyn <dig> gene has the same nucleotide sequence with vtt-d- <dig> . both of them are 99% identical to wild type qm6α , differing only two base pair substitutions . the two substitutions probably resulted from its mutagenesis steps used in the mutant selection program  <cit> .

expression of the recombinant xyn <dig> in p. pastoris
the two specific primers  were designated to incorporate the restriction enzyme sites ecori and noti respectively at their 5' ends, allowing the directional cloning of the xyn <dig> gene into ppiczαa expression vector. the target fragment was integrated into p. pastoris x- <dig> strain. the transformants were selected on ypds plate containing zeocin and the integration of xyn <dig> gene into aox <dig> location in the genome was further confirmed by pcr. the most desired integrant was chosen for small-scale induction. the size of recombinant xylanase, determined by sds-page  was  <dig> kda, similar to that of the native xylanase secreted by t. reesei. sds-page also showed that the xylanase was the major protein  secreted by p. pastoris into culture medium. therefore, the procedure for protein purification was not necessary.

for optimal production of xyn <dig>  the recombinant p. pastoris was cultured in  <dig> l bioreactor. both the highest xylanase activity  and protein concentration  in culture supernatant was recorded after  <dig> h induction . however, the highest cell dry-weight  was obtained at  <dig> h. both xylanase activity and cell dry-weight decreased slightly in the late induction period .

zymogram
when the culture medium  were subjected to native-page, xylanolytic activity was detected using oat-spelt xylan as substrate; immersion of the substrate gel in ethanol resulted in precipitation of undegraded xylan, which enhanced contrast and revealed only one clear band against a black background .

effect of ph and temperature on β-xylanase activity
enzymatic assay at different temperatures revealed that the recombinant xyn <dig> has an optimal activity at 60°c . activity decreased rapidly with temperature, i.e., at 80°c, activity of the recombinant protein represented only 30% of the optimum. concerning the effect of the ph, the enzyme showed an optimal activity at approximately ph  <dig>  . when the ph was below  <dig>  and above  <dig> , only 30%–40% of the maximum activity was reached. although the highest activity was measured at 60°c, the enzyme is not stable at this temperature . however, the recombinant xyn <dig> was stable at 50°c, and the total activity retained more than 94% after  <dig> min incubating at this temperature .

substrate specificity and kinetic parameters
the hydrolytic activity of the recombinant enzyme on various substrates was determined . the highest activity  was observed with the birchwood xylan followed by the oat-spelt xylan . the enzyme exhibited low activities towards cellulosic substrates, such as gellan gum , avicel  and cmc . the michaelis-menten constants were determined for the substrates. the km and kcat were  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig>  s- <dig> for birchwood xylan, and  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig>  s- <dig> for oat-spelt xylan, respectively.

1the activity for oat-spelt xylan was defined as 100%.

polysaccharide-binding properties
the polysaccharide-binding capacity of the recombinant xyn <dig> was determined by incubating the enzyme with avicel or oat-spelt xylan. as shown in figure  <dig>  the recombinant enzyme could not bind to avicel, as about 95% enzyme activity still remained in supernatant. in contrast, the enzyme did show its capacity to bind to xylan and 75% of the enzyme activity remained in the supernatant.

enzymatic hydrolysis of xylans
the recombinant xyn <dig> has been used to hydrolyze substrates at 5% concentration. yield of enzymatic hydrolysis was highest when birchwood xylan was used as the substrate . the wheat bran hydrolysis was lowest , but the hydrolysis for both xylan and wheat bran linearly increased with the increasing of reaction time. the products of hydrolysis of oat-spelt xylan were analyased by tlc. the predominant hydrolysis end product of oat-spelt xylan was xylotriose . the xylotriose was produced within  <dig> min of the reaction period. as the reaction time increased, both the xylotriose and xylobiose concentration increased. these results confirmed that the recombinant xyn <dig> was an endo-xylanase.

disccussion
the filamentous fungus trichoderma reesei  is one of the most efficient xylanase and cellulase producers. the highest total beta-xylanase activity obtained in shake flasks for hyperproducing mutant t. reesei rut c- <dig> was up to  <dig> nkat/ml  <cit> . however, the t. reesei culture supernantant contains many enzymes involved in both hemicellulose and cellulose degradation, and these side acitivities can be a problem for use in many applications <cit> . to resolve this problem, many researchers utilized heterologous expression system to produce xylanase from recombinant microorganisms  <cit> . in this study, the xyn <dig> gene from t. reesei rut c- <dig> was successfully cloned and expressed in p. pastoris. for functional characterization, an unpurified enzyme was used and results indicated that even the non-purified enzyme shows highly specific xylanase activity. therefore,t. reesei xyn <dig> produced in p. pastoris has an advantage of showing xylanase activity that is practically free of harmful side activities.

currently, the heterologous expression has become one of the main tools for the production of industrial enzymes  <cit> . and p. pastoris was one of the favorite expression hosts because of many advantages as we described previously <cit> . the xyn <dig> gene was inserted between a yeast promoter and transcription terminator on multicopy episomal plasmids to achieve high levels of gene expression  <cit> . for this purpose, we used the strong p. pastoris aox <dig> promoter-terminator cassettes. in addition, the secretion signal sequence from s. cerevisiae α factor prepro peptide has been used to achieve a secretory expression. as a result, the recombinant xylanase was successfully secreted into the medium as a major protein with 95% purity and apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda. the highest total β-xylanase activity obtained in shake flasks for the most efficient recombinant p. pastoris strain was  <dig> nkat/ml, which is much higher than we obtained from e. coli   <cit> . the expression level is also higher than that of levels obtained from recombinant s. cerevisiae strain  or other e. coli expression systems  <cit> . furthermore, the level may be higher than that of t. reesei rut c- <dig> if one takes into account that the t. reesei culture supernatant contains other enzymes  involved in xylan degradation  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig> there are many family  <dig> xylanases that have been expressed in p. pastoris  <cit> . however, most of them showed quite low expression levels, except in one study a higher level  was obtained for aspergillus niger xylanase with the purity of the recombinant protein being 86%  <cit> . as an unoptimized production level this is still missing from the efficiency of a recombinant t. reesei production system with published unoptimized production level of  <dig>   <dig> nkat/ml  <cit> . however, optimization is likely to further improve the production efficiency also in p. pastoris.

in comparison to saccharomyces cerevisiae, p. pastoris may have another advantage in the glycosylation of secreted proteins because it may not hyperglycosylate. the mature xyn <dig> produced by t. reesei has a molecular mass of  <dig> kda as deduced from the amino acid sequence. the molecular mass of p. pastoris xyn <dig> determined by sds-page is almost the same. however, the molecular mass of the enzyme secreted by s. cerevisiae is  <dig> kda  <cit> . there is thus a 6-kda difference in the molecular mass of the xyn <dig> secreted by p. pastoris and s. cerevisiae. this is caused by n-glycosylation  <cit> , because s. cerevisiae tends to "hyperglycosylate" heterologous proteins. however, treatment of the s. cerevisiae xyn <dig> with endoglycosidase f generated a new protein species with molecular mass of  <dig> kda, which corresponds to that of native xyn <dig> produced by t. reesei  <cit> . though this large, glycosylated protein was efficently secreted into the culture medium, the lower expression level  was not suitable for a large scale production.

because the enzyme was the predominant protein  in the culture medium, the procedure for protein purification was not necessary. when birchwood xylan was used as the substrate, the recombinant xyn <dig> showed km and kcat values of  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig>  s- <dig>  respectively. the ph and temperature optima of the recombinant xyn <dig> compared well with the xyn <dig> secreted by s. cerevisiae . both of them have a moderate thermostability and inactivated rapidly above 60°c <cit> . however, the p. pastoris xyn <dig> retained at least 40% of its total activity after  <dig> mins incubation at 60°c. the improved thermostability could be caused by amino acid mutation or glycosylation. in this study, the xyn <dig> gene  was cloned from t. reesei rut c- <dig>  however, the xyn <dig> gene expressed in s. cerevisiae was cloned from qm6α . there are two substitutions at nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> of the rut c- <dig> xyn <dig> dna sequence, resulting in two amino acids  in the protein being different from those in the protein  encoded by the qm6α xyn <dig> gene. in contrast, the e. coli xyn <dig> seems to be more thermostable than p. pastoris and native xyn <dig>  our laboratory has previously reported an e. coli expression of xyn <dig> which presents a desired thermostability and retained at least 70% of its total activity after  <dig> mins incubation at 60°c. the improved thermostability may result from the n-terminal fusion peptide . when the fusion peptide was deleted by enterokinase, the recombinant xyn <dig> retained only 50% of activity . like with t. reesei xyn <dig> expressed in s. cerevisiae, the ph optimum was the same for xyn <dig> expressed in p. pastoris . the enzyme was active over the range of ph  <dig> – <dig> .

t. reesei xyn <dig> is classified to family  <dig> xylanases and is characterized by its small molecular mass and alkaline isoelectric point  <cit> . the t. reesei xyn <dig> have five binding sites  for binding the xylopyranose rings in the vicinity of the catalytic site  <cit> . only few family  <dig> xylanases are known to have substrate-binding domain, e.g. thermomonospora fusca tfxa and streptomyces lividans xylb  <cit> . tfxa binds to both cellulose and insoluble xylan, but the enzyme has activity against only xylan. in this study, the recombinant xyn <dig> also exhibited a high activity for xylan, but a low activity for cellulosic substrates. these results were in good agreement with results from polysaccharide-binding analysis . when incubating the enzyme with avicel, more than 95% unbound enzyme was detected in the supernatant.

the hydrolytic capacity of the recombinant xyn <dig> on pretreated substrates was also determined. more than 60% hydrolysis was obtained when oat spelt xylan  was used as the substrate, whereas less than 30% hydrolysis was obtained with wheat bran. the decreased hydrolysis could be due to the fact that wheat bran contains more cellulosic compounds than xylan. in addition, the wheat bran is more difficult to dissolve. usually, family  <dig> xylanases hydrolyze xylan to form oligosaccharides of different lengths  <cit> . in this study, xyn <dig> expressed in p. pastoris hydrolyzed the oat-spelt xylan predominantly to xylotriose and in smaller amounts to xylobiose and xylose , which confirmed the endo-acting nature of the recombinant xyn <dig>  the xylooligosaccharides  has been found to be helpful for the maintenance of a healthy intestinal microflora  <cit> . but, the production of xylooligosaccharides is remaining a time consuming and expensive process. therefore, the recombinant xyn <dig> may be used for the large-scale production of xylooligosaccharides.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the p. pastoris expression system designed for the high-production of xyn <dig> allows large quantities of enzyme to be obtained in shake flasks. in addition, the recombinant xyn <dig> produced by p. pastoris are pure and completely free of any contaminating cellulases. the recombinant xyn <dig> exhibited a high specificity and hydrolysis capacity towards xylan. coupled with its broad ph profile, all these features make the enzyme very useful for various industrial applications, such as in the animal nutrition and feed science. these results also suggested that the p. pastoris expression system is more suibtable for producing family  <dig> xylanases than other heterologous expression system. future research in our laboratory will be focused on the development of a more effective vector for xylanase expression in p. pastoris and the co-expression of β-xylosidase or genes coding debranching enzymes will also be considered.
