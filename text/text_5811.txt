BACKGROUND
genetic variation in antigen components of vaccines at the pathogen level as well as in the host , are major determinants for human vaccine efficacy. mycobacterium tuberculosis  is the causative agent of tuberculosis  disease. requisites for an efficacious tb vaccine to be used in populations world-wide are a minimal genomic variation of the target antigen among different mtb strains, and the ability of the antigen’s contents of peptides to bind to the largest possible subset of hla alleles in the host populations. the tb vaccine should also be able to induce robust t-cell responses  <cit> . while cd4+ t cells are thought to take center stage in the protection against mtb infection, cd8+ t cells are also assumed to contribute to immunity against tb. consequently, the selection of a vaccine antigen is in part focused on the abundance of hla class i and class ii-binding epitopes, which may be indicative of its immunogenicity.

hla-peptide binding is a prerequisite for a putative epitope, linked to its correct processing and immunogenicity, and in silico prediction of this binding has become a tool in vaccine design. predictive computer algorithms are generally trained by databases of experimentally validated epitopes with t-cell stimulation potential, such as syfpeithi  <cit>  or the immune epitope database   <cit> . for mtb, the iedb lists predominantly major histocompatibility complex class ii -restricted epitopes of the h37rv strain  <cit> , and the number of identified mhc class i -restricted mtb epitopes is limited  <cit> . moreover, few mtb epitopes have been identified for alleles prevailing in populations in tb-endemic regions. the known epitopes that are targeted by human t cell-mediated immune responses cover only 4 % of the mtb proteome  <cit> .

the pe/ppe gene family, which includes ~ <dig> members, comprises approximately 10 % of the mtb genome  <cit> . it has been suggested that proteins secreted by these genes aid in mtb infection  <cit> , and that mtb39a  has a role in mtb virulence  <cit> . since infection can induce cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell responses to various pe/ppe proteins, some of these proteins have been evaluated as potential tb vaccine antigens  <cit> . the vaccine antigen mtb72f is a recombinant polyprotein derived from the h37rv-expressed proteins mtb39a and mtb32a   <cit> . both genes are present in both virulent and avirulent strains of the mtb complex, and in bacille calmette-guérin   <cit> . the mtb72f construct was generated by linking the carboxyl-terminal fragment of mtb32a , mtb39a, and the amino-terminal fragment of mtb32a excluding the signal sequence   <cit> . in a clinical study, the vaccine candidate mtb72f induced comparable magnitudes of mtb32a- and mtb39a-specific cd4+ t-cell responses  <cit> . collectively, at least  <dig> cd4+ or cd8+ t-cell epitopes  have been identified in mtb39a  <cit> , and a mouse cd8+ t-cell epitope was identified within mtb32c  <cit> .

several mtb72f peptides have been experimentally characterized to bind to one of three common hla class ii alleles   <cit> , or to the hla class i allele b <dig>  <cit> . the successor of mtb72f, m <dig>  was generated from the mtb72f sequence by introducing a point mutation in order to improve the long-term stability of the purified bulk of mtb72f, and by modification of the n-terminal poly-histidine  sequence. in clinical studies, these modifications were shown to have no effect on the antigen’s immunogenicity with respect to cell-mediated or humoral responses  <cit> . indeed, antigen-specific cd4+ t-cell and antibody responses were elicited by as02-adjuvanted mtb72f vaccines in various adult populations , and by as01-adjuvanted m <dig> vaccines in populations of healthy adults in tb-endemic and non-endemic regions  <cit> , hiv-1-infected adults in switzerland  <cit> , and healthy infants in the gambia  <cit> . consequently, m <dig> has been selected for further vaccine development.

the objectives of this in silico study were , to assess the sequence conservation of mtb32a, mtb39a, mtb72f and m <dig>  and , to predict mhc-i binding for nonameric peptides in mtb72f, and mhc-ii binding for 15-mer peptides in mtb72f, mtb32a and mtb39a. the predictions focused on mtb72f rather than m <dig> in order to allow comparison with previous prediction studies  <cit> , and additional evaluations were performed to assess the impact of the alterations introduced in mtb72f to generate m <dig>  mhc-ii-binding predictions were evaluated for drb <dig> alleles prevailing in populations with a high tb burden, and for drb3/4/ <dig>  dp and dq alleles. last, we compared our prediction results obtained for three drb <dig> alleles with allele-matched, experimentally derived mhc-ii binding data described in  <cit> .

our findings suggested that the mtb72f and m <dig> sequences are highly conserved among representative mycobacterium strains and that the putative t-cell epitopes predicted for these two proteins cover a wide array of hla class i and ii alleles, while highlighting the limitations of in silico epitope predictions in general.

RESULTS
sequence conservation analysis for mtb32a, mtb39a, mtb72f and m72
using sequence similarity search programs, we assessed the similarity of h37rv-derived mtb32a and mtb39a among genomes of mycobacterium strains causing human tb disease, and h37ra. for the  <dig> strains for which both sequences were available, similarity was also evaluated for the mtb72f and m <dig> sequences constructed in silico. furthermore, the presence of nucleotide and amino acid changes was evaluated for mtb39a, given the relatively high frequency of sequence polymorphism reported for this protein  <cit> . the strains evaluated included clinical isolates and representatives of all presently available mtb strains, and comprised representatives of five of the six geographical lineages identified in a molecular phylogeny of the mtb complex, which cover the predominant part of the mtb geographical distribution  <cit> .

for mtb39a, we observed mainly single residue or nucleotide insertions and/or deletions with minor consequences for amino acid sequences, although amino acid changes were detected in 67 % of strains assessed . indeed, amino acid sequence comparisons revealed an average of 98 % identity for mtb39a, with 100 % identity for  <dig> strains and at least 91 % identity among all strains excluding eas <dig> and h37ra. the latter strains contained one frameshift each, both associated with major amino acid changes of  <dig> and  <dig> residues, respectively, and consequently also with lower similarity . relative to mtb39a, sequence identity was higher for mtb32a , consistent with earlier reports  <cit> .table  <dig> similarity of mtb32a, mtb39a, mtb72f and m <dig> among selected mycobacterium strains

mhc-ii-binding peptides in mtb32a, mtb39a and mtb72f
a computerized algorithm  was used to compute mhc-ii binding predictions for 15-mer peptides in mtb72f and  mtb32a and mtb39a, for  <dig> hla-drb <dig>   <dig> drb3/4/ <dig>   <dig> dq and  <dig> dp alleles. the drb <dig> alleles were selected based on their presence in populations in four regions with a high tb prevalence  and in the native population of sub-saharan africa, which has a high tb incidence. the  <dig> most common drb3/4/ <dig> alleles  <cit>  and the subset of dq/dp molecules that are present in at least 85 % of populations worldwide  <cit>  were also included, and together our selection contained the full panel of  <dig> dr, dp and dq alleles reported to collectively cover almost 90 % of populations worldwide  <cit> .

across regions, no peptides were predicted to bind to five alleles  for mtb32a, and to two alleles  for mtb39a. consequently, binding peptides were also not predicted for drb1*16: <dig> and 03: <dig> for mtb72f, since for drb1*16: <dig> all binding peptides were predicted to be located in the mtb32a signal sequence , while for drb1*03: <dig> no binding peptides were predicted for any part of mtb32a or mtb39a. reported allele frequencies in certain sub-saharan african, chinese and indian populations  are relatively low for drb1*16: <dig>  and higher for drb1*03: <dig> .

for the  <dig> drb3/4/ <dig>   <dig> hla-dq and  <dig> hla-dp molecules, we predicted up to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> binding peptides in mtb72f per allele, respectively . binding peptides in mtb72f were predicted for each drb3/4/ <dig> and dp/dq allele assessed, with the exception of dqa1*02:01-dqb1*02: <dig>  and dpa1*02:02-dpb1*05: <dig> . worldwide, genotypic frequencies of dqa1*02:01-dqb1*02: <dig> and dpa1*02:02-dpb1*05: <dig> are 6 % and 12 %, respectively  <cit> , but for the populations assessed, no frequencies of these alleles have been reported in the used database . for dqa1*02:01-dqb1*02: <dig> in haplotype with drb1*07: <dig>  frequencies in various populations ranged from 1–15 %. for drb1*07: <dig>  and thus also for the drb1*07:01-dqa1*02:01-dqb1*02: <dig> haplotypes,  <dig> peptides were predicted in mtb72f , with potentially higher numbers for haplotypes that also include dpb1*02: <dig> .table  <dig> prediction of hla ii-binding peptides for drb3/4/ <dig>  dp and dq alleles

impact of the alterations made to construct mtb72f and m <dig>  on mhc-ii binding predictions
several alterations have been introduced into the native mtb32a sequence in order to construct mtb72f  <cit> ; summarized in table 4), and hence we have assessed the potential impact thereof on the prediction results for mtb72f. we observed that the alterations resulted in a reduction of  <dig> predicted binding peptides, as well as in  <dig> and  <dig> additional predicted  binding peptides owing to the addition of the poly-his tag and the hinge sequences respectively. as described in the previous section, no binding peptides were predicted after the alterations for one allele  due to the deletion of the mtb32a signal sequence. additional evaluations were performed to assess the impact of the modifications introduced into mtb72f in order to generate m <dig>  comprising the change of the n-terminal poly-his sequence from mhhhhhh to mhh, and the substitution of one serine residue for an alanine residue. neither of the modifications resulted in a change in the number of alleles with at least one predicted putative epitope. no putative epitopes were predicted to be present in the mhh tag, and thus this modification of the poly-his tag resulted in the loss of the above described non-mtb binding peptide predicted for the mtb72f poly-his tag.table  <dig> impact of the alterations introduced for the mtb72f construction on the peptide binding predictions

comparison of mhc-ii binding predictions for  <dig> drb <dig> alleles with experimental data
we compared our prediction results for three common hla class ii alleles  with binding data obtained in vitro for mtb32a and mtb39a from maeurer et al.  <cit> . in the latter study, the binding to soluble recombinant hla-ii monomers of three alleles was experimentally determined for  <dig> 15-mer mtb peptides.

for mtb72f predictions, the algorithm’s sensitivity was higher for drb1*01: <dig> than for drb1*04: <dig> or drb1*15: <dig>  as  <dig>   <dig> and 33 % respectively of the allele-matched experimentally identified binding peptides were also predicted by the algorithm, while the reverse was found for the specificities . the same trends were observed for the prediction results obtained for mtb32a and mtb39a separately.table  <dig> comparison of experimentally-defined and predicted 15-mer hla class ii-binding peptides for three drb <dig> alleles

discussion
this in silico study explored the sequence conservation of mtb32a, mtb39a, mtb72f and the current candidate vaccine antigen m <dig>  and predicted mhc-i and/or mhc-ii-binding peptides for these proteins. our results led to two main conclusions. first, the mtb32a and mtb39a proteins  appeared to be well conserved  among the strains representative for the major part of the mtb geographical distribution , with for mtb39a a higher sequence conservation than previously reported in  <cit> . second, the putative cd4+ t-cell epitopes predicted for mtb72f and m <dig> were shown to cover a broad range of hla class ii drb <dig>  drb3/4/ <dig>  dq and dp alleles, and the putative cd8+ t-cell epitopes predicted for mtb72f covered each of the hla-a or -b alleles assessed.

hyperconservation has been reported for the large majority of human t-cell epitopes in the mtb complex, although pe/ppe genes were excluded from that study  <cit> . previously, mtb32a sequences of h37ra, h37rv, erdman and the clinical isolate csu <dig> were found to be identical  <cit> , and, extending these studies, mtb32a was shown to be relatively well conserved among several clinical isolates, with amino acid changes in only 6 % of the  <dig> investigated strains  <cit> . consistently, our data revealed a high level of conservation for mtb32a. for mtb39a, our findings contrast with previous studies which suggested a substantial genetic variation for this protein, potentially associated with the homologous recombination with ppe <dig> and ppe <dig>  <cit> . nonetheless, several of the minor insertions and/or deletions we observed in the mtb39a sequence  may be identical to those reported for arkansas-derived samples in the above study  <cit> . of the frameshifts leading to major amino acid changes, as we observed in  <dig> strains, the one in the avirulent h37ra strain was consistent with earlier findings  <cit>  and of little clinical relevance, while the one in eas <dig> has not been reported previously to the best of our knowledge. possibly, the number and origin of the strains evaluated here reflect the worldwide prevalence of mtb more accurately than those used in the referenced studies, which included  <dig> us and turkey-derived clinical strains  <cit> , or  <dig> clinical isolate sequences from a public database  <cit> . as we have not assessed whether the minor insertions and/or deletions coincide with locations of predicted putative epitopes, the impact of the associated residue changes on the recognition of clinical mtb strains by t-cell responses induced by mtb72f or m <dig> candidate vaccines, is not known.

mhc-ii binding peptides in mtb72f were predicted to cover all drb <dig>  drb3/4/ <dig>  dq and dp alleles assessed, except for  <dig> drb <dig> alleles ,  <dig> dq and  <dig> dp allele. based on the used database, this dp allele  does not occur in the populations assessed, while the dq allele  only prevails in these populations in haplotype with drb1*07: <dig>  which was predicted to be well covered with binding peptides. several aspects are important to consider with respect to the implications of the absence of predicted binding peptides for the two drb <dig> alleles for the candidate vaccines’ potential efficacy in the populations concerned. first, except for the higher frequency of drb1*03: <dig> in certain sub-saharan african populations  as compared with the worldwide genotypic frequency of  <dig>  %  <cit> , the associated allele frequencies were generally low in these populations . moreover, a potential absence of binding peptides for the two drb <dig> alleles in these populations may be compensated by peptides present on other hla-dr, −dp or -dq alleles, and vice versa. for instance, for the south-african limpopo venda population, drb1*13: <dig> and dqb1*03:01–03: <dig> have been associated with tb disease  <cit> . in this population, the frequency of drb1*03: <dig> is relatively high . the absence of binding peptides for drb1*03: <dig> may in this case be compensated by several other alleles prevailing at high frequencies in this population , for which we predicted high numbers of binding peptides per allele in mtb72f. it may also be reassuring that in a recent clinical trial, the candidate vaccine m72/as <dig> was able to induce robust cd4+ t-cell responses in healthy adults in south africa  <cit> . furthermore, it is noted that for other antigens  it was shown that a set of only  <dig> predicted t-cell epitopes could theoretically cover large proportions of over  <dig> populations worldwide  <cit> . a confounding factor is that the allele frequencies sourced from a public database may have only partial or local coverage , since they are usually based on relatively small sample sizes rather than population statistics. similarly, since certain alleles specific to susceptible populations have likely been the prime focus of several studies, the database may contain disproportionally high numbers of such alleles.

although our data showed that the changes introduced in mtb32a in order to construct mtb72f may result in an overall reduction of mtb binding peptides, only two alleles present in the populations assessed  were predicted to have no binding peptide in mtb72f. the other modifications  were predicted to jointly generate  <dig> binding peptides, of which one peptide was predicted to be absent in m <dig>  since non-mtb epitopes do not contribute to the vaccine’s ability to induce mtb-specific responses, their relatively low frequency in mtb72f and m <dig> is reassuring.

previously, in silico mhc-ii binding predictions for 9-mer peptides in mtb72f have been generated for  <dig> drb <dig> alleles  <cit> . comparison of the previous data with the present predictions for 15-mer peptides and drb <dig> alleles revealed up to 37-fold differences in the allele-matched binding peptide numbers, which can likely for a great part be explained by the different binding peptide lengths assumed by the prediction algorithm. hla-i and hla-ii binding peptides are composed of 8– <dig> and 13– <dig> amino acids respectively  <cit> . the peptide-binding groove of mch-ii molecules is open-ended, which complicates identification of the 9-mer core peptides and the flanking residues . mhc-ii prediction algorithms assuming 9-mer binding peptides do not use information present outside the core, leading to lower accuracy  <cit> . consistently, it was shown that including flanking residues among inputs improved the performance of mhc-ii prediction methods  <cit> . however, even predictions generated by algorithms assuming 15-mer binding peptides may have limited reproducibility, as suggested by the present results. indeed, comparison of our results for mtb32a and mtb39a with allele-matched experimental binding data  <cit>  revealed that the algorithm’s sensitivity and specificity were variable and occasionally rather low for mtb72f . it is noted though that due to the lack of additional suitable in vitro data, this comparison covered only  <dig> of the  <dig> hla-drb <dig> alleles, and none of the drb3/4/ <dig>  dq and dp alleles assessed in our study. while the observed variability in the performance of the algorithm may be a consequence of the limited extent of this evaluation, it could therefore also be inherent to the limitations of the used prediction algorithms for peptide binding in general. similarly, most algorithms predicting t-cell activation for class ii binding peptides display low sensitivity, as less than half of the defined t-cell activating peptides were predicted to be binders  <cit> . thus, epitope identification requires an integrated approach, in which in silico binding predictions are complemented with confirmatory biochemical verification of mhc processing and binding, and of the ability of the predicted peptides to induce t-cell responses  <cit> . other useful tools are in silico methods that enable linking binding affinity patterns to topological characteristics  <cit> .

due to the capped mhc-i peptide binding groove, this binding is more specific than binding to mhc-ii, and hla-i binding prediction algorithms are considered relatively accurate  <cit> . indeed, there was only at most a five-fold difference between the previously reported numbers of hla a- and b-binding peptides in mtb72f  <cit>  and the numbers per allele computed here.

in the present study, the majority of predicted peptides were presented by a*02: <dig>  listed in the iedb among the most frequent hla class i alleles in regions with high tb incidence  <cit> . the predicted high affinity-binders were mainly presented by a*02: <dig> and b*07: <dig> rather than a*03: <dig>  consistent with data obtained for a panel of  <dig> h37rv-derived peptides  <cit> , while other mtb proteins  were shown, experimentally or in silico, to be primarily presented by various hla-b molecules  <cit> . furthermore, our data showing the predicted binding of the mtb72f peptides apinsatam, apaaaaqav, llgqntpai and ssklgglwk to b*07: <dig>  b*07: <dig>  a*02: <dig> and a*03: <dig> respectively corroborates earlier predictions for these peptides  <cit> . of note, several previously predicted hla i-restricted mtb peptides were experimentally shown to induce cd4+ rather than cd8+ t cell responses  <cit> . similarly, the hla-b44-restricted epitope mwaqdaaamf  <cit> , was also found in two 15-mer mtb39a peptides that were experimentally defined  <cit>  and predicted here to bind to drb1*04: <dig> and/or 01: <dig> 

last, for cytomegalovirus antigens, it has been suggested that less than  <dig> uniquely defined hla-restricted cd8+ t-cell epitopes could provide 90 % coverage of the three major ethnic groups  <cit> . possibly, the putative class i mtb epitopes predicted for mtb72f could also have a wide coverage of populations worldwide, and, given that only minor changes were introduced into mtb72f to generate m <dig>  this would also apply to m <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
mtb72f and m <dig> sequences were shown to be highly conserved among mycobacterium strains including mdr and xdr strains, and are thus expected to provide broad coverage of the pathogen population. for mtb72f, the predicted mhc-ii binding peptides covered a wide array of hla-drb <dig>  −dq and -dp alleles, whereby the absence of predicted binding peptides for  <dig> drb <dig> alleles prevailing in some populations with high tb burden may be compensated by peptides binding to other hla loci. mhc-i binding peptides were predicted for each hla-a/b allele assessed. yet, discrepancies between the current predictions and experimental hla-binding data underscore the limitations inherent in interpreting in silico predictions for hla class ii-restricted peptides. experimental epitope verification, by determination of the hla-binding capacity of synthetic peptides and of their correct processing, remains valuable. also, their immunogenicity could be confirmed by identification of t cells specific for the epitope, using pbmcs from hla-typed subjects.
