BACKGROUND
abscisic acid  is a phytohormone regulating plant responses to a variety of environmental stress, particularly water deprivation, notably by regulating stomatal aperture  <cit> . it also plays an essential role in mediating the initiation and maintenance of seed dormancy  <cit> . late in seed maturation, the embryo develops and enters a dormant state that is triggered by an increase in the aba concentration. this leads to the cessation of cell division and activation of genes encoding seed storage proteins and proteins required to establish desiccation tolerance  <cit> . exposure of seeds to aba during germination leads to rapid but reversible arrest in development. aba-mediated postgermination arrest allows germinating seedlings to survive early water stress  <cit> . based on aba inhibition of seed germination, mutants with altered aba sensitivity have been identified. these screens have led to the identification of several aba-insensitive genes  <cit> . the transcription factors abi <dig> and abi <dig> are known to be important regulators of aba-dependent growth arrest during germination  <cit> . abi <dig>  an aba-insensitive gene, encodes a basic leucine zipper transcription factor. expression of abi <dig> defines a narrow developmental checkpoint following germination, during which arabidopsis plants sense the water status in the environment. abi <dig> is a rate-limiting factor conferring aba-mediated postgermination developmental growth arrest  <cit> .abi <dig> is also reactivated by aba during a short development window. like abi <dig>  abi <dig> is also required for the aba-dependent postgermination growth arrest  <cit> . however, abi <dig> acts upstream of abi <dig> and is essential for abi <dig> gene expression  <cit> . in arrested, germinated embryos, aba can activate de novo late embryogenesis programs to confer osmotic tolerance. during a short development window, abi <dig>  abi <dig> and late embryogenesis genes are reactivated by aba. aba can activate abi <dig> occupancy on the promoter of several late embryogenesis-abundant genes, including em <dig> and em <dig> and induce their expression  <cit> . on the other hand, aba-induced mir <dig> accumulation requires abi <dig> but is only partially dependent on abi <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig>  two mir <dig> targets, are positive regulators of aba responses during germination and are subject to aba-dependent mir <dig> regulation  <cit> .

the family of plant-specific wrky transcription factors contains over  <dig> members in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . wrky proteins typically contain one or two domains composed of about  <dig> amino acids with the conserved amino acid sequence wrkygqk, together with a novel zinc-finger motif. wrky domain shows a high binding affinity to the ttgacc/t w-box sequence  <cit> . based on the number of wrky domains and the pattern of the zinc-finger motif, wrky proteins can be divided into  <dig> different groups in arabidopsis  <cit> .

a growing body of studies has shown that wrky genes are involved in regulating plant responses to biotic stresses. a majority of reported studies on wrky genes address their involvement in disease responses and salicylic acid -mediated defense  <cit> . in addition, wrky genes are involved in plant responses to wounding  <cit> . although most wrky proteins studied thus far have been implicated in regulating biotic stress responses, some wrky genes regulate plant responses to freezing  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit> , drought, salinity, cold, and heat  <cit> .

there is also increasing evidence indicating that wrky proteins are key regulators in certain developmental programs. some wrky genes regulate biosynthesis of anthocyanin  <cit> , starch  <cit> , and sesquiterpene  <cit> . other wrky genes may regulate embryogenesis  <cit> , seed size  <cit> , seed coat and trichome development  <cit> , and senescence  <cit> .

a number of studies have suggested that wrky genes may mediate seed germination and postgermination growth. for example, wild oat wrky proteins  bind to the box2/w-box of the ga-regulated α-amy <dig> promoter  <cit> . a barley wrky gene, hvwrky <dig>  and its rice  ortholog, oswrky <dig> act as a transcriptional repressor of gibberellin-responsive genes in aleurone cells  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether wrky genes mediate aba-dependent seed germination and postgermination growth arrest. in this study, we report that wrky2- <dig> and wrky2- <dig> mutants are hypersensitive to aba during germination and postgermination early growth. we have analyzed genetic interactions between the wrky <dig> mutant and the abi3- <dig> and abi5- <dig> mutants and found that aba hypersensitivity of the wrky <dig> mutants is attributable to increased mrna levels for abi <dig>  abi <dig> and abi5-induced em <dig> and em <dig>  furthermore, abi <dig>  abi <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig> are important regulators of aba-induced expression of wrky <dig> 

RESULTS
wrky <dig> t-dna insertion mutants are hypersensitive to aba during seed germination and postgermination early growth
to analyze the molecular events in aba-regulated germination and seedling growth, we sought to identify wrky transcription factors associated with these growth and developmental stages. for this purpose, we screened t-dna insertion mutants for a number of arabidopsis wrky genes for altered sensitivity to aba based on their germination rates and seedling growth in ms media containing aba. as shown in figure  <dig>  wrky <dig> t-dna insertion mutants wrky2- <dig>  and wrky2- <dig>  accumulated no wrky <dig> transcript of expected size and exhibited increased sensitivity to aba during seed germination and seedling growth. the two mutants display no other obvious phenotypes in morphology, growth, development or seed size .

to determine the role of wrky <dig> in seed germination and early seedling growth, wild-type and wrky <dig> mutant seeds were germinated on ms medium containing  <dig> μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm aba, and compared for differences in germination and postgerminative growth. in the absence of aba, there was no significant difference in germination between wild-type and mutant seeds . in the presence of aba, both mutants germinated later than wild type. on ms medium with  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, 40% and 25% of wild-type seeds germinated after one day, respectively. at these two concentrations, the germination rates of the two mutants were only about half of wild type . on ms medium with  <dig>  μm, 10% of wild-type seeds still germinated, but no wrky2- <dig> and wrky2- <dig> seeds germinated. likewise, significantly more wild-type seeds germinated than the mutant seeds after two days on ms medium with  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm aba . early seedling growth of both mutants was also slower than that of wild type. after  <dig> d, 46% of wild-type but only 4% of wrky2- <dig> and none of wrky2- <dig> mutants had green cotyledons on ms medium with  <dig>  μm aba . these results show that wrky <dig> mutants are hypersensitive to aba responses during germination and postgermination growth.

to analyze the role of wrky <dig> during the seedling growth stages, we first germinated the wild-type and wrky <dig> mutant seeds on ms medium for  <dig> d and then transferred the seedlings onto ms medium containing  <dig> μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig> μm,  <dig> μm,  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm aba. no significant difference was observed between the wild type and wrky <dig> mutants  <dig> days after the transfer .

when the germination experiments were carried out in dark, wrky <dig> mutants are again more sensitive to aba responses than wild type . taken together, these observations suggest that wrky <dig> mutants are hypersensitive to aba responses only during seed germination and early seedling growth.

response of wrky <dig> mutants to aba defines a limited developmental window
the transcription factors abi <dig> and abi <dig> are known to be important regulators of aba-dependent growth arrest during germination  <cit> . abi <dig> and abi <dig> are reactivated by aba during a short development window. given the aba hypersensitivity of wrky <dig> mutants, we studied the effect of aba on the early development of wrky <dig> mutants. application of  <dig> μm aba  <cit>  within  <dig> h post-stratification maintained the germinated embryos of wrky <dig> mutants in an arrested state for several days, but did not prevent germination, whereas a significant percentage of wild-type germinated embryos escaped growth arrest and turned green . aba applied outside the 48-h time frame failed to arrest growth and prevent greening . if the seeds were transferred to aba-containing media immediately or one day after stratification, we observed that the wrky <dig> mutants were more sensitive to aba responses than the wild type. however, if the seeds were transferred to aba-containing media  <dig> days post-stratification, there was no significant difference between the wild type and wrky <dig> mutants. these results indicated that wrky <dig> mutants were hypersensitive to aba responses for a short development window.

wrky <dig> mediates signal pathway of aba-dependent germination and postgermination early growth
during germination, aba can activate de novo late embryogenesis programs to confer osmotic tolerance in arrested, germinated embryos  <cit> . during a short development window, abi <dig>  abi <dig> and late embryogenesis genes are reactivated by aba. abi <dig> acts upstream of abi <dig> and is essential for abi <dig> gene expression. aba induces abi <dig> occupancy on the promoter of em <dig> and em <dig>  and activates these late embryogenesis-abundant genes  <cit> . to analyze the expression of these genes in wrky <dig> mutants, we germinated the wild type and wrky <dig> mutants on ms medium with  <dig> and  <dig>  μm aba for  <dig> or  <dig> days. total rna was isolated and analyzed using quantitative rt-pcr with gene-specific primers. as shown in figure  <dig>  when these seedlings have grown on ms medium without aba  <dig> days post-stratification, expression of abi <dig>  abi <dig>  em <dig> and em <dig> was reduced in the wrky <dig> mutants relative to that in the wild type. at  <dig> days post-stratification, wild type and wrky <dig> mutants accumulated similar levels of transcripts for abi <dig>  abi <dig>  em <dig> and em <dig> .

on the other hand, on medium containing aba, the expression levels of abi <dig>  abi <dig>  em <dig> and em <dig> were similar in the wild type and wrky <dig> mutants at  <dig> days post-stratification. however, at  <dig> days post-stratification, there were higher expression levels of these genes in wrky <dig> mutants than in the wild type, which was consistent with microarray analysis . by contrast at  <dig> days post-stratification, the expression of abi <dig> and em <dig> didn't decrease or decreased only slightly in wrky <dig> mutants, but decreased rapidly in the wild type within  <dig> days post-stratification. within  <dig> days post-stratification, expression of aib <dig> decreased faster in wild type than in wrky <dig> mutants. expression of em <dig> increased in wrky <dig> mutants  <dig> days post-stratification, but was unchanged in wild type .

rna was extracted from seedlings of wrky <dig> mutants and wild type on ms medium with  <dig>  μm aba  <dig> d post-stratification. relative rna levels of abi <dig>  abi <dig>  em <dig>  em <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> were analyzed by microarray data.

these results indicated that wrky <dig> mutants displayed delayed or decreased expression of abi <dig> and abi <dig>  but increased or prolonged expression of em <dig> and em <dig> 

the expression of wrky <dig> in aba-insensitive mutants and aba-deficient mutants
because wrky <dig> mutants are more sensitive to aba during seed germination and postgermination growth arrest than the wild type, and wrky <dig> mutants also affect important genes of the aba signal pathway in the regulation of germination and postgermination growth, we analyze whether abi3- <dig>  abi5- <dig>  aba2- <dig> and aba3- <dig> mutants have an effect on the expression of wrky <dig>  we germinated all seeds on ms medium with  <dig> or  <dig>  μm aba for  <dig> days post-stratification. we performed quantitative rt-pcr with gene-specific primers. in the absence of aba, the expression level of wrky <dig> in the wild type  was  <dig>  times of that in the abi5- <dig> mutants. in the presence of aba, the level of wrky <dig> was  <dig> -fold. on the other hand, aba treatment led to  <dig> -fold increase in accumulation of wrky <dig> in the wild type and  <dig> -fold increase in abi5- <dig> mutants . these results suggest abi <dig> is an important regulator of aba-induced wrky <dig> expression.

without aba, the level of wrky <dig> in the wild type  was  <dig> -fold higher than that in abi3- <dig> mutant. in the presence of aba, the wrky <dig> transcript level in wild type was  <dig> -fold higher than that in abi3- <dig> mutant . these results indicate abi <dig> maybe is a positive regulator of aba-induced wrky <dig>  we also examined the expression level of wrky <dig> in aba-deficient aba2- <dig> and aba3- <dig> mutants  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  with aba, the expression level of wrky <dig> in the wild type was  <dig>  time higher than that without aba, but the expression levels of wrky <dig> in aba2- <dig> and aba3- <dig> mutants were only  <dig>  and  <dig>  times of those without aba, respectively. on the other hands, without aba, the expression levels of wrky <dig> in aba2- <dig> and aba3- <dig> mutants were  <dig>  and  <dig>  times of that in the wild type. these observations show elevated expression of wrky <dig> by aba treatment requires aba <dig> and aba <dig>  these results strongly suggest that abi <dig>  abi <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig> are important regulators of aba-induced wrky <dig> expression.

the response of wrky <dig> to aba is independent of mir <dig>  myb <dig> and myb101
it is known that aba-induced mir <dig> accumulation requires abi <dig> but is only partially dependent on abi <dig>  furthermore, myb <dig> and myb <dig>  which are mir <dig> targets, are positive regulators of aba responses during germination and are subject to aba-dependent mir <dig> regulation  <cit> . figure 8a indicates that there was no significant difference in the level of mature mir <dig> between wrky <dig> mutants and the wild type. as shown in figure 8b and table  <dig>  there was no difference in levels of transcripts of myb <dig> and myb <dig> either. these results indicate that wrky2-mediated aba signaling pathway is independent of mir <dig> and its target genes  during seed germination and postgermination growth arrest.

discussion
the ability of exogenous aba to arrest postgermination development has been used extensively to identify genes involved in aba signaling  <cit> . in the present study, we discovered that wrky2- <dig> and wrky2- <dig> mutants were more sensitive than wild type to aba responses during seed germination and postgermination early growth.

the wrky <dig> mutants are hypersensitive to aba responses only within a short development window during seed germination and early seedling growth. during seed germination and early growth, the transcription factors abi <dig> and abi <dig> are known to be important regulators of aba-dependent growth arrest, and their expression defines a narrow developmental checkpoint following germination  <cit> . abi <dig> is a key player in aba-triggered postgermination growth arrest, and the abi <dig> mutant seeds are insensitive to growth arrest by aba, whereas seeds of abi5-overexpressing lines are hypersensitive to aba  <cit> . abi <dig> acts upstream of abi <dig> and is an important regulator of germination and postgermination growth by aba  <cit> . aba-induced abi <dig> also occupies the promoter of em <dig> and em <dig> and activates these two late embryogenesis-abundant genes  <cit> . lopez-molina et al.  have shown that application of  <dig> μm aba within  <dig> h post-stratification in the wild type  <cit>   does not prevent germination, but arrest the germinated embryos for several days, during which both abi <dig> transcripts and abi <dig> proteins are detected at high levels. when applied outside the 60-h time frame, however, aba fails to arrest growth and prevent greening and abi <dig> transcripts and proteins are present at low levels  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the aba-induced growth-arrest of wrky <dig> mutants might be associated with the expression level of abi <dig>  to test this hypothesis, we compared wild type and wrky <dig> mutants for analyzed aba-regulated expression levels of abi <dig> and abi5-related important regulators during seed germination and postgermination development. we found that wrky <dig> mutants had higher mrna levels of abi <dig>  abi <dig> and abi5-induced em <dig> and em <dig> than the wild type . the higher expression levels of these genes in the wrky <dig> mutants may be partly responsible for the enhanced growth arrest relative to that in the wild type in the presence of aba .

with aba treatment, mir <dig> accumulation requires abi <dig> but is only partially dependent on abi <dig>  <cit> . myb <dig> and myb <dig>  which are mir <dig> targets, are positive regulators of aba responses during germination  <cit> . therefore we examined whether wrky <dig> affected the mrna levels of these genes. we found that the expression levels of these genes were not significantly different between wrky <dig> mutants and the wild type . these observations indicate that the response of wrky <dig> to aba during germination and early growth is independent of mir <dig> and its target genes .

we also show that abi <dig>  abi <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig> are important positive regulators of aba-induced wrky <dig> accumulation . the expression levels of wrky <dig> were elevated more drastically in the wild type than in abi5- <dig> and abi3- <dig> mutants after aba treatment . this result indicates that these two genes are positive regulators of aba-induced wrky <dig> accumulation.

genes encoding the enzymes for most of the steps of the aba biosynthesis pathway have been cloned and their functions confirmed using aba-deficient mutants for aba <dig>  <cit> , aba <dig>  <cit> , aba <dig>  <cit>  and aba <dig>  <cit> . we analyzed the effect of aba biosynthesis genes on wrky <dig> transcripts using aba-deficient aba2- <dig> and aba3- <dig> mutants  <cit> . we shows that elevated expression of wrky <dig> after aba treatment requires aba <dig> and aba <dig>  indicating that these two genes are positive regulators of aba-induced wrky <dig> accumulation .

several studies have shown that abi <dig> binds to the aba-responsive dna elements  with an acgt core in the promoter of em <dig> and em <dig>  and activates their expression  <cit> . on the other hand, other reports have shown that wild oat wrky proteins  bind to the box2/w-box of the ga-regulated α-amy <dig> promoter  <cit> , and gawrky <dig> highly activated the cad1-a promoter by binding to w-box  <cit> , and a barley wrky gene, hvwrky <dig>  and its rice  ortholog, oswrky <dig> act as a transcriptional repressor of gibberellin-responsive genes in aleurone cells  <cit> . the promoter zone of wrky <dig> has an aba-responsive dna element  containing an acgt core, and the promoter zone of abi <dig> has  <dig> w-box, whereas the promoter of abi <dig> has  <dig> w-box. this raises the possibility that wrky <dig>  abi <dig> and abi <dig> are mutually regulated.

CONCLUSIONS
transcription factors abi <dig> is an important regulator of postgermination developmental arrest mediated by aba. postgermination proteolytic degradation of the essential abi <dig> transcription factor is interrupted by perception of an increase in aba concentration, leading to abi <dig> accumulation and reactivation of embryonic genes. here we report that wrky2- <dig> and wrky2- <dig> mutants are more sensitive to aba responses than the wild type during seed germination and postgermination early seedling establishment. aba hypersensitivity of the wrky <dig> mutants is attributable to elevated mrna levels of abi <dig>  abi <dig> and abi5-induced em <dig> and em <dig> in the mutants. wrky2-mediated aba responses are independent of mir <dig> and its target genes myb <dig> and myb <dig>  aba-induced wrky <dig> accumulation during germination and postgermination early growth requires abi <dig>  abi <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig>  suggesting that they are important regulators of the transcripts of wrky <dig> by aba treatment. our results suggest that wrky <dig> transcription factor mediates seed germination and postgermination developmental arrest by aba.
