BACKGROUND
in the last twenty years there has been an explosion in the demand for custom oligonucleotide synthesis to support a vast array of genomics applications. despite improvements and automation in standard solid phase phosphoramidite chemistry, oligonucleotide synthesis remains a relatively inefficient, expensive and wasteful process, where the scale of synthesis may be many thousands of times the minute quantities required for a single pcr or sequencing reaction. cost considerations have led to most oligonucleotides being synthesized at dedicated off-site facilities or large core facilities. the extra transportation time has hindered the development of applications requiring rapid turn around times.

these undesirable aspects of custom oligonucleotide synthesis, can be avoided by employing a pre-synthesized shortmer library in which each oligonucleotide is immediately available with little waste as only the primer needed is used <cit> . existing approaches, however, have proven of little utility as the primers from shortmer libraries are compromised by the necessity of constraining the library size to a manageable level. for example, while complete libraries of 5-mers and 6-mers , can be produced and used without difficulty, they lack the specificity and hybridization stability to work reliably as dna polymerase primers <cit> . since each additional base increases the library size four fold, the shortest reliable primer length  requires impossibly large libraries of  <dig> to  <dig> million primers.

in a compromise, partial libraries consisting of primers of  <dig> or  <dig> base length, have been designed for application in dna sequencing  <cit> . these libraries have achieved little practical utility largely due to their poor priming efficiency on dna templates containing significant secondary structure at the low hybridization temperatures required to anneal shortmers <cit> .

a number of refinements to this approach have attempted to overcome this deficiency by combining multiple primers to fabricate longer oligonucleotides with a defined sequence. in one method strings of two, three or more hexamers are assembled and ligated side by side on template dna to form a primer <cit> . more recently this has been accomplished with chemically ligated octamers  <cit> . alternatively, unligated strings of 2- <dig> hexamers hybridize side by side to form a modular sequencing primer stabilized by base stacking interactions alone  <cit> . in another variation, the selected hexamers are ligated into defined strings by complimentary hexamers that overlap the junction in the opposite strand of a double helix  <cit> . while these developments of the shortmer strategy are appealing, their utility remains limited by poor hybridization and ligation efficiency, particularly on highly structured dna templates that exist at the low temperatures required for hybridization and ligation of short modules  <cit> .

in the methodology described here, we have developed an efficient composite primer strategy that uses dna polymerase rather than dna ligase to increase the hybridization affinity of library oligonucleotides. the priming specificity encoded by the unique pentamer sequence in each library member is more than doubled in a combinatorial process that uses one oligonucleotide as a template for polymerase extension. after careful consideration and optimization of this concept, a library consisting of  <dig> oligonucleotides was produced that can generate over  <dig>  sequence optimized 11-mers. we have demonstrated that this dna polymerase dependent assembly process can be seamlessly integrated into existing dna sequencing reactions and provides all the advantages of using a preexisting primer library while maintain the hybridization specificity of chemical synthesis. while this approach was developed to facilitate the primer walking strategy for large scale dna sequencing projects <cit> , this instant primer assembly system could have a plethora of applications in genomics and molecular biology.

RESULTS
polymerase mediated oligonucleotide synthesis 
the pmos system provides an efficient means to generate a large number of specific oligonucleotides from a small-prefabricated library of precursors. this is achieved by using one oligo from the library as a template for extension  from the 3' end of another oligo in the library, such that the specificity encoded by each precursor is combined in the extended oligo.

the precursor oligonucleotides that constitute the library are divided into template oligos  and extendable oligos . the to's contain a 3'-amine blocking group to prevent extension, whereas the extendable oligos  retain the capacity for extension by dna polymerase and are in effect mini-primers . hybridization between the to and eo occurs at a  <dig> bp overlap consisting of a  <dig> bp region of generic complementarity known as the "clamp" region and a  <dig> bp section termed the "catch" region. while the sequence in the catch region of each eo is unique, the corresponding region in the to is degenerate to enable each one to hybridise with any eo . this capacity for universal association between eo's and to's enables the oligonucleotide library to mix in different combinations and produce a total number of different primers equal to the product of eo's and to's . the strength and alignment of the eo/to interaction is supported by a defined gc rich clamp sequence . this sequence is retained in the 5' end of each primer generated but does not affect their function in dna sequencing and amplification.

pcr using pmos
the application of pmos in pcr was shown in two separate reactions carried out using the forward primer pairs e128/t <dig> and e382/t <dig> . in each reaction the conventional m <dig> reverse primer was used on a  <dig>  kilobase plasmid  containing the ftsz gene insert from e. coli template dna . amplification was carried out over  <dig> cycles and the products resolved on a 1% agarose gel. pcrs containing eo's  <dig> or  <dig> and m <dig> reverse alone were incapable of generating pcr products . however, when e <dig>  t <dig>  and e <dig>  t <dig> were all present, the expected pcr amplicons of length  <dig> and  <dig> respectively were obtained . a positive control reaction was performed using ec <dig>  a full-length synthetic primer equivalent to the extended e <dig> .

while both composite forward primers generated their respective amplicons with m <dig> reverse, we found that the e128/t <dig> pair displayed greater specificity and efficiency than that provided by e382/t <dig>  we hypothesised that this was due to the non-template dependent addition of a single adenosine to the 3' end of the eo beyond the extremity of its to. in the case of e128/t <dig> pair, this a addition provides an extra nucleotide that assists in hybridization with a corresponding t in the target sequence, thus bringing its annealing length to  <dig> bases. this would enhance both the affinity and specificity of the extended primer. by contrast, the addition of an a at the end of the extended e382/t <dig> pair produces an 11-mer that is terminally mismatched with respect to the target template sequence.

dna cycle sequencing using pmos
to examine the potential of pmos for dna sequencing, oligonucleotide e <dig> and template oligonucleotide t827n <dig>  were mixed with a linear dna fragment from the streptomycin operon in e. coli,  <dig> μl of bigdye sequencing chemistry,  <dig> μl of  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig> and  <dig> μl of  <dig> μm dgtp. after  <dig> thermocycles, the sequencing fragments were resolved on an abi  <dig> dna sequencer and analysed by abi prism™ sequence analysis software. the electropherogram from this reaction displayed strong signal strength and the expected sequence . a negative control reaction primed by the non-extended e <dig> primer was performed but no sequence signal was generated.

optimisation of sequencing chemistry for pmos
the previous experiment demonstrated that a combination of extendable oligonucleotides and template oligonucleotides with a degenerate catch region could be used directly to prime dna sequencing reactions. during this investigation we found that reactions in commercial sequencing chemistries were enhanced by supplementing with mgcl <dig> and dgtp. the optimal magnesium chloride concentration was determined through a series of sequencing reactions performed with the addition of  <dig> μl of  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> solution. the best result was achieved after adding the  <dig>  mm solution. at lower concentrations there was a reduction of sequence signal, while at higher concentrations there was no further improvement .

we also found that additional dgtp improved sequencing signal strength using the pmos primers in abi bigdye sequencing chemistry version  <dig>  after testing a range of dgtp concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> μm,  <dig> μm supplement was found to be optimal. at higher concentrations there was an increase in sequencing errors, while lower concentrations reduced the sequencing signal. we also looked at other commercial sequencing chemistries such as abi bigdye sequencing chemistry version  <dig> and dyenamic et terminator . both of these chemistries were compatible with direct pmos primer assembly and yielded good sequencing results without any further modification of the pmos method .

the optimal eo:to molar ratio was determined by varying the concentration of t827n <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig> μm, while keeping the e <dig> concentration constant at  <dig> μm. an eo to to molar ratio of between 1: <dig> and 2: <dig> was found to give the highest quality sequencing results. higher eo:to ratios were found to result in less signal intensity, presumably due to inefficient extension of the eo primer in the presence of limiting amounts of the to primer. lower ratios  gave mixed sequence signal.

the optimal concentrations of eo and to primers in the sequencing reaction were also determined. the e <dig> and t827n <dig> concentration  were varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> μm. the optimum concentration was found to be  <dig> μm. lower concentrations produced high quality sequence at the expense of reduced signal intensity. higher primer concentrations produced more sequencing signal, but at the expense of an increased error rate .

optimisation of pmos oligonucleotides
a key feature of the pmos library system  is the ability of the unique  <dig> base sequences in the catch region of each eo primer to hybridise with the corresponding generic region in every to primer . this is accomplished with a degenerate or mixed base composition in the catch region of the to. to determine the influence of catch region hybridisation strength on sequencing quality, three sequencing reactions were performed using three different eo/to pairs with ascending levels of g+c content . as predicted the eo primer with the highest 5'-g+c content  produced the most sequencing signal, followed by intermediate , and no g+c content  respectively .

in order to accommodate the observed preference for high g+c content in this part of the catch region we restricted the eo library to oligonucleotides that contained g or c bases at positions  <dig> &  <dig>  this also allowed for the reduction in degeneracy at the corresponding position in tos. an experiment was performed to investigate the impact of this change by comparing sequencing efficiency of complete to catch degeneracy  with tos having reduced degeneracy at one position  and two positions  where s is an equal mixture of g and c . as expected, t827n <dig> and t827n <dig> resulted in greater dna sequencing signals than the completely degenerate version t827n <dig> .

to further maximise catch region hybridisation efficiency, the adenosine bases  of the eo were substituted for the high affinity analogue  <dig> -diaminopurine   <cit> . this substitution was found to further improve dna sequencing signal and efficiency.

effect of non-template addition of adenosine in pmos
dna sequencing protocols typically employ dna polymerases lacking 3'-5' exonuclease and have a tendency to add non-template directed adenine residue at the 3' end of extension product <cit> . as a consequence an eo primer extended with a dna sequencing polymerase will usually have an additional 3' adenine. primers with this additional 3' adenine are not expected to function effectively in sequencing reaction unless there is a corresponding thymine on the template sequence. to test this hypothesis, eo and to primers were designed for a target site that did not contain a complementary thymine downstream of the target site . a cycle sequencing reaction was performed as described previously with  <dig> pmol of e <dig> and  <dig> pmol of t <dig> . only very poor sequencing data was obtained, which indicates that an additional 3'a on an extended eo without a complementary position in the sequencing template prevents efficient extension during the sequencing reaction.

dna cycle sequencing using pmos library primers
a biologically optimised library consisting of  <dig> extendable oligonucleotides and  <dig> compatible template oligonucleotides was synthesised for the purpose of testing pmos in sequencing projects . the pmos library, distributed across two  <dig> well plates, has been used successfully in our laboratory in thousands of dna sequencing reactions. this is exemplified here in two reactions on puc <dig> template dna carried out using eo/to pairs e154/t <dig> and e167/t <dig>  respectively, according to conditions described earlier. the electropherograms from both reactions were strong and gave an unambiguous signal corresponding to the expected sequence in each case . to validate the utility for pmos in cycle sequencing, we carried out  <dig> sequencing reaction of a bac library without any specific optimisation and achieved a success rate of 65% . while this success rate was lower than that produced for an equivalent shotgun project, possibly due in part to the failure of some pmos primers, the overall coverage achieved by this approach was superior and required substantially fewer sequencing reactions. gaps produced by as a consequence of failed reaction were closed using adjacent pmos primers targeting upstream and downstream segments of the template dna.

discussion
the universal primer fabrication system  described here provides a simple and efficient means to generate specific 11-mer from a 768-member library of pre-synthesised oligonucleotides. in the pmos approach, the oligonucleotide of interest is generated by hybridising two precursors, such that in the presence of a dna polymerase , the desired primer is generated by an extension reaction . to maximize the utility of pmos, we examined the influence of a number of parameters in order to generate the optimal library of eo and to precursors molecules.

optimisation of pmos oligonucleotide design
the versatility of pmos is derived from its ability to achieve both high specificity and high coverage in a very small library. to find the ideal balance between the conflicting demands of specificity and simplicity, the hybridisation kinetics of the eo/to pair and s-primer/target pair was finely tuned while managing the library complexity. the key strategy employed to reduce the library size was to introduce degeneracy into the catch region of the to such that it will have complementarity and hybridise with each and every eo. this meant that with only  <dig> eos and  <dig> tos the library could generate  <dig>   different extended eos. rather than introduce complete sequence redundancy at all five catch positions, we restricted the 5' dinucleotide of the catch region tos to an equal mixture of guanine and cytosine . the corresponding variable region at the 3' terminus of the eos was also restricted to the four different combinations of guanine and cytosine to enforce high affinity interaction with each to at the point of extension.

the use of the generic bases 5-nitroindole and 3-nitropyrole was investigated as an alternative to degenerate positions in the to catch region. while these universal nucleotide analogues are reported to be capable of binding with all four conventional bases, we found their performance inferior to degeneracy. a modification of the catch region that we did find effective, was the replacement of adenosine with its high affinity analogue  <dig> -diaminopurine  <cit> . this base analogue has the ability to form tridentate hydrogen bonds with thymine, increasing both the hybridisation strength between eo/to and the s-primer to its target sequence .

a number of different designs for the clamp region were also considered and tested to maximise the hybridisation strength while minimising interaction with motifs commonly found in cloning vectors and genomes. the clamp region sequence that was used  fulfilling these requirements with a low free energy of hybridisation and no sequence similarity to plasmid backbones of the common puc plasmid family.

library rationalisation
to reduce the size of the library, sequence motifs that are not found, or that are very rare in biological systems, were omitted. the library was also screened for sequences with difficult motifs characterised by extreme gc content; monotony such as polynucleotide runs; form primer dimers or hairpin formation. removal of these eos and tos resulted in a substantial reduction in library complexity without significantly lowering its utility for hybridizing to biologically derived nucleic acid templates.

to further enhance the utility of the library we developed companion software  to facilitate the primer selection process. this software scans within the target range of input sequences and identifies the best to and eo pair from the library for the purpose of amplifying the target or sequencing the upstream or downstream template. the output of uniselect can be used directly as an input for liquid handling robots to complete the cycle from sequence data collection back to reaction setup, without the need for human intervention.

non-template directed extension
the dna polymerases commonly used for pcr and sequencing such as taq dna polymerase and thermosequenase catalyse non-template directed addition of a single nucleotide. while the extent of this activity is influenced to some degree by the terminal sequence  <cit> , the extended nucleotide is almost always adenosine because of its higher affinity for the active site in the absence of template  <cit> . in our experience extendable primers designed without regard to this affect were severely impaired in their ability to prime sequencing and amplification reactions. this was likely due to the terminal mismatch between these primers and their template sequence. by contrast extendable primers selected to take advantage of this effect by pairing this extra base with a corresponding thymine in the template were far superior and behaved as 11-mers. however, in circumstances where terminal addition of adenosine is unwanted, a proofreading polymerase can be used to ensure strict template directed extension  <cit> . we achieve this routinely by performing pmos in the presence of klenow fragment.

applications
while solid phase chemical synthesis methods can provide oligonucleotides for a myriad of biomolecular and nanotechnology applications, the process is relatively slow and wasteful where only small quantities are required. pmos is an efficient primer construction system that is capable of generating a large number of high affinity oligonucleotides from a small library of prefabricated precursors. the system features a library consisting of  <dig> oligonucleotides that generates more than  <dig>  different biologically optimized 11-mers via an efficient primer extension reaction. this contrasts with the hexamer and octamer libraries, which are both complex  and inefficient.

while we have focussed primarily cycle sequencing, pmos can potentially be used in any application requiring oligonucleotides including, ligation chain reaction   <cit> , reverse-transcriptase pcr   <cit> , primer extension reaction for mrna-transcript analysis <cit> , self-sustaining sequence replication  <cit> , rolling circle amplification <cit> , strand displacement amplification  <cit> , isothermal dna amplification <cit>  and dna-sequencing by the original sanger method  <cit> . for applications that do not require dna polymerase activity, extension of eos can be performed prior to use in a preparative reaction.

CONCLUSIONS
the pmos library system coupled with extension mediated primer synthesis provides the ability to efficiently obtain primers in minutes without waste and at a fraction of the cost of custom solid phase synthesis. this has many applications including the potential to replace shotgun dna sequencing with a more rational primer walking strategy, with up to 80% savings in resources, time and cost.
