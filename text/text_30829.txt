BACKGROUND
the chromatin fiber in the chromosomes of multicellular animals is organized into a hierarchical set of topologically independent domains . this hierarchical loop domain organization is critical for the proper utilization and propagation of the genetic information encoded by the chromosome and it is intimately involved in such processes as gene regulation, replication, recombination, repair, and mitosis. a special set of architectural elements, called boundaries or insulators, are responsible for both subdividing the chromatin fiber into discrete domains and determining their hierarchical organization. these architectural elements have a seemingly contradictory set of functions. when placed between enhancers/silencers and their target genes, they block regulatory interactions . however, insulators also have the ability to promote regulatory interactions between enhancers/silencers and their target genes. one mechanism depends upon insulator pairing interactions that connect distant chromosomal segments together at the base of a topological loop  <cit> . when the regulatory elements in the loop are properly oriented, these insulator–insulator pairing interactions can place distant enhancers/silencers in close proximity to target genes. additionally, there is suggestive evidence that insulators can have an even more direct role in mediating enhancer–promoter interactions .

nearly a dozen dna binding proteins that have insulator/architectural activity have been discovered. of these, the most broadly conserved protein is the ccctc-binding factor, ctcf  <cit> . except for a few lineages that have apparently lost the ctcf gene, it is a characteristic feature of bilaterian organisms . ctcf was initially identified as a transcription factor that can both repress and activate transcription  <cit> . subsequent experiments in flies and vertebrates showed that ctcf also has enhancer-blocking activity and to date it is the only mammalian protein has been shown to have this insulator activity . in addition to its roles in gene regulation, a growing body of evidence points to an architectural function. for example, in vertebrates ctcf mediates specific long-distance interactions between insulators and regulatory elements located at megabase distances and even on different chromosomes . similarly, drosophila dctcf can support pairing-dependent insulator bypass in transgene assays when two sets of multimerized binding sites for the protein are arranged in the appropriate orientation  <cit> .

like the ctcf proteins of vertebrates, drosophila ctcf contains  <dig> c2h <dig> zinc fingers flanked by n-terminal domains  and c-terminal domains   <cit> . the dctcf zinc fingers show significant homology with their vertebrate counterparts, and this is reflected in the similar sequence recognition properties of the vertebrate and fly proteins  <cit> . in contrast, the ntds and ctds are not well conserved and there are reasons to think that the differences between the ntds and ctds of vertebrate and fly proteins have mechanistic implications. the insulator/architectural activities of vertebrate ctcf depend at least in part upon its ability to recruit the cohesin complex to specific chromosomal sites . cohesin knockdowns were shown to impair both the insulator  and architectural  functions of ctcf  <cit> . the vertebrate cohesin complex consists of four proteins: smc <dig>  smc <dig>  scc <dig>  and sa/stag  <cit> . smc <dig> and smc <dig> form a ring in the presence of atp, and this ring is stabilized by the binding of scc <dig> and sa/stag. vertebrate ctcf is thought to recruit cohesins to specific chromosomal sites by interacting directly with the sa/stag subunit of cohesin complex. xiao et al.  <cit>  have shown that sequences in the c-terminal tail of ctcf are responsible for specific interactions with sa/stag, and that insulator activity and cohesin recruitment are disrupted when this region of the ctcf protein is mutated.

dctcf differs from its vertebrate counterpart in that it does not appear to co-localize with cohesins  <cit> . this finding has led to the idea that other proteins might fulfill the long-distance linking function envisioned for cohesins. one plausible candidate is cp <dig>  <cit> . it was originally identified as a microtubule binding protein that associates with the centrosome during mitosis  <cit> . however, subsequent studies argued against a centrosome or mitotic function and instead pointed to a role in some aspect of nuclear architecture or chromosome structure  <cit> . support for this idea came from the discovery that cp <dig> is required for the enhancer-blocking activity of the gypsy su insulator and is a component both of this transposon insulator and of endogenous su insulators  <cit> . the connection to chromosome architecture was further supported by studies showing that cp <dig> localizes to many dctcf sites and can be co-immunoprecipitated with dctcf .

in the studies reported here we have examined the functioning dctcf protein in more detail. using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches we have identified the cp <dig> interaction domain. we also uncovered a dctcf dimerization/multimerization domain that, like cp <dig>  could potentially mediate interactions between distant dna sequences containing dctcf in vivo. in the course of this analysis we have re-examined the effects of dctcf null mutations, and tested whether dctcf proteins lacking the cp <dig> interaction domain or the dctcf dimerization/multimerization domain can rescue the null mutation.

RESULTS
dctcf contains an n-terminal dimerization domain
the  <dig> zinc fingers of the ctcf proteins are highly conserved in bilaterian phyla  <cit>  . in contrast, the ntds and ctds were poorly conserved and there was little sequence similarity even between proteins from different dipteran families . sequence alignment of ctcf proteins from species within the drosophila genus revealed much more extensive homology in the ntds and ctds, including several very well conserved sequence blocks . a plausible hypothesis is that these conserved sequences may serve as protein interaction modules that are important for dctcf activities.fig.  <dig>

one of the interactions that could be mediated by these modules was the dimerization or multimerization of the dctcf protein. this possibility was suggested by insulator bypass experiments in which pairs of multimerized and appropriately oriented ctcf binding sites could mediate long-distance regulatory interactions  <cit> . additionally, studies on vertebrate ctcf have suggested that it can form dimers  <cit> . to test for the presence of homo-dimerization/multimerization modules in the n- or c-terminus of the dctcf protein, we fractionated bacterially expressed thioredoxin-fused ntd or ctd proteins by size-exclusion chromatography. as shown in fig. 1b, the thioredoxin ntd fusion 1– <dig> had a hydrodynamic molecular mass significantly larger  than that predicted for the monomer . similar results were obtained for the ctd 612– <dig> protein .

the presence of these larger complexes could be explained by either a module-dependent multimer formation or by the presence of intrinsically disordered regions that lead to non-specific protein aggregation. to distinguish between these possibilities we used glutaraldehyde cross-linking to probe for complex formation. in the case of the ctd 612– <dig> protein, glutaraldehyde cross-linking was quite inefficient, suggesting that it likely forms non-specific aggregates . on the other hand, consistent with the results of the size-exclusion chromatography, cross-linking of the ntd 1– <dig> protein gave a high yield of a multimeric band of ~ <dig> kd .

to further pinpoint the interaction module, we generated three c-terminal deletions . the smallest deletion, ntd 1– <dig>  gave a cross-linked band of ~ <dig> kd. the largest c-terminal deletion, ntd 1– <dig>  also gave a cross-linked product; however, the yield was quite low compared to the ntd 1– <dig> protein . this suggests that key interaction sequences were located between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  this suggestion was supported by ntd 1– <dig>  which was much more efficiently cross-linked than ntd 1– <dig> . though ntd 1– <dig> gave a prominent cross-linked band at the approximate size expected for the tetramer , there was also a ladder of larger bands. this ladder was likely due, at least in part, to the presence of the thioredoxin moiety in the fusion protein, as only two cross-linked bands were observed when thioredoxin was removed . taken together, these findings map the n-terminal dctcf:dctcf multimerization module to sequences spanning the region between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> and suggest that this module likely mediates the formation of dimers or possibly tetrameric complexes. further support for the formation of multimeric complexes  came from size-exclusion chromatography of the ntd 1– <dig> protein , which gave a predicted mass of  <dig> kd . however, it is also possible that disordered regions of the protein retard complex mobility during size-exclusion chromatography.

several additional lines of evidence localized the dctcf multimerization module to this region of the ntd. first, two internal deletions  that lacked sequences from this interval failed to cross-link efficiently . second, two terminally truncated proteins, ntd 125– <dig> and ntd 70– <dig> , that contained this part of the ntd were cross-linked efficiently . third, protease digestion indicated that the region containing the interaction module had an ordered structure. we subjected the thioredoxin ntd 1– <dig> fusion protein to limited proteinase k or trypsin digestion and then analyzed the resulting protease-resistant products by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight  mass spectrometry . both proteases generated two resistant-to-digestion products. one corresponded to thioredoxin, while the other to a dctcf ntd peptide extending from  <dig> to  <dig> 

to independently demonstrate that the ntd contains a dctcf multimerization module we used two different in vivo assays. the first was a yeast two-hybrid assay . sequences encoding the ntd 1– <dig> amino acids were fused in-frame to the yeast gal <dig> dna binding domain  and activation domain . because steric hindrance can interfere with transcriptional activation in the two-hybrid system, the ntd 1– <dig> sequence was placed at both the n-terminus  and the c-terminus  of the fusion protein. fig. 1f shows that activation was observed in only one configuration, ntd-bd and ad-ntd. similar results were obtained when the ntd was tested with a full-length dctcf protein .

in the second assay, we ectopically expressed a 3xflag-tagged fusion protein consisting of the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of dctcf, a nuclear localization signal and the bacterial lexa dna bd in drosophila s <dig> tissue culture cells. the s <dig> cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the firefly luciferase protein, whose expression is dependent upon a minimal tata-box promoter and upstream 4xlexa binding sites . measurements of luciferase activity relative to a renilla luciferase co-transfection control indicated that the 3xflag-n-terminal dctcf-lexa fusion protein weakly activated firefly luciferase expression from the 4xlexa-tata reporter . by contrast, no activation was observed for a luciferase reporter that lacked the 4xlexa binding sites or when the 3xflag-tagged fusion protein had the lexa dna bd but not the dctcf n-terminal domain. the chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments in fig. 2c show that when the n-terminal dctcf fusion protein was tethered to the 4xlexa-tata reporter via the lexa bd, it could interact with and recruit endogenous full-length dctcf. because cp <dig> antibodies were also able to immunoprecipitate the 4xlexa-tata reporter, it would appear that the full-length dctcf protein could in turn recruit cp <dig> to the 4xlexa-tata reporter .fig.  <dig>

the btbcp <dig> dimer interacts with the c-terminal domain of dctcf
cp <dig> has an n-terminal btb-poz  protein–protein interaction domain, which is followed by an aspartic acid-rich d domain, a microtubule targeting domain, four c2h <dig> zinc fingers , and finally a glutamic acid rich c terminal domain . previously it was shown that the cp <dig> protein interacts with dctcf  <cit> . while interacting modules in the two proteins were not identified, it was found that the btb domain is required for the binding of cp <dig> to chromatin  <cit> .fig.  <dig>

to identify modules in dctcf that mediate cp <dig> interaction, we first used the yeast two-hybrid assay. dctcf was subdivided into the ntd, the zinc fingers plus the ctd, and the ctd alone and each was fused to the gal <dig> activation domain. the ntd failed to interact, while the full-length protein, the zinc fingers plus the ctd, and the ctd alone gave transcriptional activation when combined with full-length cp <dig> . the localization of the cp <dig> interaction module in dctcf to the ctd was confirmed by gst pull-down experiments. a gst-fusion protein containing the dctcf-ctd 612– <dig> domain was found to pull down both bacterially expressed cp <dig> and cp <dig> in drosophila s <dig> cell nuclear extracts .

to further pinpoint the sequences within the 612– <dig> ctd that are important for contacting cp <dig>  we expressed two different flag-tagged c-terminal deletions, dctcfΔ610- <dig> and dctcfΔ774- <dig>  in drosophila s <dig> cells. figure 3e shows that flag-tagged wild-type dctcf and a control n-terminal deletion could be precipitated by cp <dig> antibodies from the s <dig> extracts. in contrast, neither of the smaller dctcf-ctd deletions was precipitated by cp <dig> antibodies from s <dig> cells. taken together, these findings indicate that an apparently rather large sequence is required to mediate a dctcf–cp <dig> association that is stable in s <dig> nuclear extracts.

we used a similar strategy to localize the region in the cp <dig> protein that mediates interactions with dctcf. for the yeast two-hybrid experiments, full-length dctcf was fused to the gal <dig> activation domain, while different sub-fragments from cp <dig> were fused to the gal <dig> dna bd. these experiments map a dctcf interaction module to the cp <dig> btb domain . this was confirmed by gst pull-down experiments  which showed strong protein–protein interactions between the cp <dig> btb domain  and dctcf. in addition, weak interactions were detected between the dctcf-ctd and gst–cp <dig> fusions spanning the microtubule interaction domain .

we have previously shown that the cp <dig> btb domain exists as a stable homodimer  <cit> . this observation raised the possibility that a cp <dig> dimer could simultaneously bind two dctcf proteins, linking them together in the same manner that the bcl <dig> btb dimer is thought to bring together two smrt co-repressors  <cit> . however, glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments argue that the predominant complex consists of a btbcp <dig> dimer linked to a single ctd protein. figure 4a shows that the cp <dig> btb domain alone formed a stable dimer that could be readily captured by glutaraldehyde cross-linking. when the btb domain was present in a twofold excess over the dctcf–ctd 612– <dig> protein, the cross-linked btbcp <dig> dimer disappeared and was replaced by a band migrating with an apparent molecular weight of ~ <dig> kd. while this cross-linked complex migrated more slowly than we would have predicted, we interpret it to be a 2xbtbcp190:ctd 612– <dig> trimer based on the stoichiometry of the two proteins. this conclusion was supported by cross-linking experiments in the presence of increasing amounts of the ctd protein . at a ctd to btb ratio of 1: <dig> and 1: <dig>  the predominant cross-linked species was the ~ <dig> kd 2xbtbcp190:ctd trimer, whereas there was little if any of the btbcp <dig> dimer. only at ratios of 1: <dig> or 2: <dig> did we observe a larger species that could correspond to the btbcp <dig> dimer linked to two ctd proteins or to some other more complex structure. however, under these conditions a significant fraction of the ctd protein appeared to be free monomer, and this would also argue that the preferred configuration is a 2xbtbcp190:ctd heterotrimer.fig.  <dig>

rescuing a dctcf null allele
if the ntd and ctd interaction modules are critical for dctcf function, then dctcf proteins that lack these modules should be defective. as a prelude to assaying the activity of ntd and ctd mutant proteins in vivo, we determined whether dctcf mutant flies could be rescued by a transgene expressing the wild-type dctcf protein. several putative dctcf null alleles have been reported  <cit> . flies homozygous for these mutations  mainly died during larvae–pupae stages. for the wild-type rescue construct we generated p-element transformants of a hybrid fusion gene that expresses the dctcf cdna under the control of the ubiquitously expressed hsp <dig> promoter  <cit> . to identify the transgene proteins, a sequence encoding a 3xflag epitope was introduced at the beginning of the dctcf open reading frame. five independent transgene inserts were recovered on the first and second chromosomes; however, none of these transgenes rescued the lethal effects of the four dctcf alleles. one reason why the transgenes were unable to complement the four dctcf alleles is that they did not express as much protein as the endogenous dctcf gene. an alternative possibility is that there were additional lethal lesions on the chromosomes carrying these particular dctcf mutations.

a fifth predicted dctcf null allele, ge <dig>  has been described  <cit> . the viability of adults homozygous for the ge <dig> mutation is reduced by a third or more, while f <dig> flies do not survive. the ge <dig> mutation was generated by insertion of an eps transposon in reverse orientation into the third exon of the dctcf gene . the eps transposon contains an hsp <dig> minimal promoter that drives transcription in the opposite orientation to the dctcf gene  <cit> . the promoter is under control of a gal4-responsive enhancer. as would be expected from its insertion site, the ge <dig> disrupts expression of the dctcf protein. extracts prepared from f <dig> adults homozygous for the ge <dig> mutation showed no dctcf-specific bands when probed with antibodies directed against n-terminal or c-terminal regions of the dctcf protein . unlike the other dctcf alleles, we found that two copies of the hsp83-dctcf+ transgene rescued the f <dig> and f <dig> lethal phenotypes of the ge <dig> mutation.fig.  <dig>

to confirm these findings, we generated two imprecise excisions, gex <dig> and gex <dig>  by introducing the p transposase. as indicated in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  both imprecise excisions disrupted the coding sequence and were expected to encode only a truncated protein containing the first ~158 n-terminal amino acids. both excision derivatives had the same phenotypic effects as ge <dig> and were complemented by the hsp83-dctcf+ transgene. these results support the conclusion that ge <dig> is a null allele of the dctcf gene  <cit> .

as was shown previously  <cit> , adult flies homozygous for the ge <dig> mutation as well as the two excision derivatives had a mild but highly penetrant held out wing phenotype and thin bristles throughout the animal, and exhibited a series of homeotic phenotypes in posterior parasegments indicative of a loss of abd-b activity. these homeotic phenotypes were temperature dependent. they were typically observed in flies raised at 25 °c, while they were much less frequent when the flies were raised at 18 °c. one of these phenotypes was the presence of a rudimentary a <dig> segment in males as would be expected for a loss-of-function transformation of ps <dig> into ps <dig> . another was a protruding and rotated male genitalia. also unlike wild-type males, ge <dig> males had bristles on the a <dig> sternite and sometimes also patchy pigmentation of the a <dig> tergite. the former phenotype is characteristic of a ps <dig> to ps <dig> transformation, while the latter is expected for a ps <dig> to ps <dig> transformation. while a <dig> and a <dig> do not form cuticular structures in adult males, they contribute to the cuticle in females. homeotic transformations of the a <dig> sternite into a <dig> were evident in surviving ge <dig> females . adult mutant females had significantly reduced egg production, and produced no viable offspring when mated to homozygous mutant males. these lethal effects could, however, be rescued by mating the homozygous mutant females to heterozygous balancer males. this finding indicates that zygotic dctcf expression can compensate for the absence of maternally derived dctcf.

selective depletion of dctcf from the bithorax complex in ge <dig> pupae
mohan et al.  found that though the levels of dctcf were substantially reduced in ge <dig> larvae, maternally derived protein could still be detected at approximately 25 % of the sites in salivary gland polytene chromosomes that are normally observed in wild-type polytenes  <cit> . one idea suggested by this observation is that the homeotic transformations evident in ge <dig> adults arise because dctcf is selectively lost from the bithorax complex . when dctcf depletion compromises bx-c insulator function, this might enable polycomb response elements  in silenced cis-regulatory domains to repress neighboring active cis-regulatory domains and thus downregulate abd-b expression in a manner that changes segmental identity. alternatively, or in fact in addition, the proper functioning of the abd-b promoter could require dctcf.

mohan et al.  <cit>  addressed this question by examining dctcf association with bx-c in the brain of wild-type and ge24185/df <dig> larvae and found that dctcf was absent from most insulators in the complex, but was detected at abd-b promoter. we have repeated these experiments using chromatin prepared from pupae because it is during this stage that the adult cuticle is elaborated. we selected six dctcf binding sites from bx-c: the mcp, fab- <dig>  fab- <dig> insulators , fab- <dig> region, fab- <dig> region, and the abd-b promoter region   <cit> . we also selected the cg <dig> promoter region   <cit>  and four regions that were identified by schwartz et al.  <cit>  as requiring dctcf to block the spread of h3k27me <dig> in the bgl <dig> cell line  <cit> . in addition to testing dctcf association with these sequences, we also assayed cp <dig> fig.  <dig> histograms show dctcf or cp <dig> occupancy in chromatin isolated from mid-late pupa at sequences containing the bx-c insulators fab- <dig>  fab- <dig>  mcp, fab- <dig>  fab- <dig>  the abd-d promoter, and several previously defined dctcf insulators . cross-linked chromatin prepared from wild-type   pupae and homozygous ge <dig>  mutant pupae was immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the n-terminal domain of dctcf and cp <dig>  sequences from tub, rpl <dig>  and 62d regions were used as negative controls for dctcf and cp <dig> association. 62d is an example of a sequence in which cp <dig> occupancy is independent of dctcf. the left axis shows the scale for dctcf enrichment, while the right axis shows the scale for cp <dig> enrichment. each chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment was performed in at least two independent biological replicates. error bars show standard deviations of quadruplicate pcr measurements. the results are presented as a percentage of input dna



chip experiments with chromatin isolated from wild-type pupae using antibodies directed against the n-terminal region of dctcf confirmed that it was bound to the insulators and the abd-b promoter in bx-c and to the cg <dig> promoter  and four bgl <dig> insulators . however, the extent of enrichment of fab- <dig>  fab- <dig>  and the abd-b promoter was about half that of the other bx-c insulators  and also of the cg <dig> promoter  and four bgl <dig> insulators. as expected, the enrichment of the bx-c dctcf sequences was substantially reduced in chips of homozygous ge <dig> pupae. the extent of reduction was not, however, uniform. near-background levels of dctcf were observed for fab- <dig>  fab- <dig>  fab- <dig>  and the abd-b promoter in ge <dig> mutant pupae, while residual dctcf could still be detected at mcp and, to a lesser extent, fab- <dig>  by contrast, only one bgl <dig> insulator, 24c <dig>  showed a loss of dctcf equivalent to that seen for most of the bx-c sequences. three of the other insulators, 9a <dig>  21e <dig>  and 57b4r, showed only very modest reductions. though the loss of dctcf at the fourth insulator, 27b <dig>  was more substantial, the occupancy level in mutant pupae was still about the same as that seen for several of the bx-c elements in wild type.

the rather modest reductions in dctcf evident at several non-bx-c insulators as well as the residual dctcf that was retained at two of the bx-c insulators in the absence of a zygotic source of dctcf protein would suggest that a significant amount of maternally derived dctcf remains up to at least the pupal stage in ge <dig> mutant animals. moreover, it would appear that the protein is preferentially retained at a subset of the dctcf insulators. however, an alternative explanation for the apparent persistence of maternal dctcf is that our antibody recognized some other protein species that happened to bind to the insulators that were pulled down in chips of the mutant pupae. to exclude this possibility, we used an antibody directed against the c-terminal region of the dctcf protein for chip experiments . chips with this antibody paralleled those obtained with the n-terminal antibody. substantial amounts of dctcf persisted at several non-bx-c insulators in ge <dig> mutant pupae, while there was still some residual dctcf remaining at the bx-c insulators mcp and fab- <dig> 

with the exception of mcp, all of the bx-c insulators and the abd-b promoter had less cp <dig> than the bgl <dig> insulators. the effects of ge <dig> mutation on cp <dig> association with the bx-c and bgl <dig> sequences also followed a pattern similar to that observed for dctcf. for all of the bx-c insulators, loss of dctcf was accompanied by a loss of cp <dig>  for the other insulators, the reduction in cp <dig> occupancy was, with one exception, roughly comparable to that seen at the insulator for dctcf. for example, dctcf levels were reduced about 40 % for 9a <dig>  while cp <dig> was reduced about 50 %. the one exception was 27b <dig>  which lacked cp <dig> in ge <dig> mutant pupae, yet retained significant dctcf occupancy. to confirm that the loss of cp <dig> occupancy at dctcf insulators was not due to a reduction in cp <dig> protein levels, we probed western blots of extracts prepared from wild-type and ge <dig> mutant pupae .

role of ctds and ntds in functional activity of the dctcf protein
to examine the in vivo functions of the n-terminal multimerization domain and the c- terminal cp <dig> interacting domain, we generated hsp <dig> transgenic lines expressing flagx3-tagged dctcf proteins lacking these domains. for the multimerization domain, we deleted sequences between amino acid  <dig> and amino acid  <dig> . this deletion spans the region required for dctcf–dctcf interactions in vitro. for the cp <dig> interaction module, we used the c-terminal 774– <dig> deletion  that eliminates interactions between ctcf and cp <dig> in s <dig> cells . the activities of two independent transgenic lines expressing the deleted proteins were tested in the ge <dig> mutant background.

as described above, the control transgene, dctcf+, encoding the wild-type protein fully complemented the zygotic and maternal effect lethality of the ge <dig> mutation . it also rescued the thin bristles phenotype and the loss-of-function homeotic transformations evident in ps11- <dig> . however, in approximately 10 % of the dctcf+ males we observed a partial loss of pigmentation in the tergite of abdominal segment a <dig>  which is characteristic of a loss-of-function transformation of a <dig>  to a <dig>  transformation  <cit> . the held out wing phenotype was also not rescued. the dctcfΔc transgenes resembled dctcf+. they fully rescued the zygotic and maternal effect lethality of the ge <dig> mutations, the thin bristles, and the ps11- <dig> homeotic transformations in males and females. like dctcf+, we also observed a partial loss of pigmentation on the a <dig> tergite; however, the frequency was somewhat higher  and the size of the depigmented patches was typically larger. in contrast to dctcfΔc, the dctcfΔn transgene only partially ameliorated the zygotic and maternal effect lethality of ge <dig> and dctcfΔn transgenic flies had reduced viability and were only semi-fertile. in addition, dctcfΔn did not rescue the thin bristles phenotype or the homeotic transformation seen in the abdominal segments of ge <dig> adult males and females .

chromatin association of dctcf+, dctcfΔc, and dctcfΔn
as a prelude to analyzing the chromosome association of the mutant dctcf proteins, we first examined the expression of transgenic wild-type and mutant dctcf proteins. for this purpose we probed fly extracts with antibodies directed against the flag tag. as shown in the western blot in additional file 8: figure s <dig>  the mutant proteins were expressed at nearly equivalent levels. when we probed western blots with antibodies directed against dctcf, we found that the levels of proteins produced by the transgenes were about twofold less than that of the endogenous gene . this would suggest that the incomplete rescue of two of the ge <dig> phenotypes  by the hsp83:dctcf+ transgene is likely due, at least in part, to the insufficient expression of dctcf.

next, we examined the association of transgenic wild-type and deletion mutant dctcf with the insulators and abd-b promoter in bx-c, cg <dig> promoter , and the bgl <dig> insulators. in chips of chromatin isolated from ge <dig> hsp83:dctcf+ pupae we found that the occupancy levels of the transgenic dctcf+ at most of these sites were reduced about twofold compared to the endogenous protein in wild-type flies . this reduction would be consistent with the lower levels of dctcf in the ge <dig> hsp83:dctcf+ flies. however, there were three exceptions. for two of these, the fab- <dig> and fab- <dig> insulators, the reductions in dctcf occupancy were greater than twofold. dctcf occupancy at fab- <dig> was reduced by nearly tenfold while it was reduced by almost fourfold at fab- <dig>  while fab- <dig> still retained levels of dctcf comparable to several other bx-c sites, only a small amount of dctcf was detected at fab- <dig>  because one function of the fab- <dig> insulator in ps <dig> cells is to prevent inactivation of the iab- <dig> cis-regulatory domain by blocking the spread of polycomb-dependent silencing from the pre in the adjacent iab- <dig> cis-regulatory domain, the substantial reduction in dctcf association with the fab- <dig> insulator could potentially account for the persistence of the a5–a <dig> transformation in a subset of the ge <dig> flies rescued by hsp83:dctcf+. the other exception, the bgl 57b4r insulator, had near wild-type levels of dctcf.fig.  <dig> histograms show dctcf or cp <dig> occupancy in chromatin from mid-late pupa at sequences containing the bx-c insulators mcp, fab- <dig>  fab- <dig>  the abd-b promoter, and several other previously defined dctcf insulators . chromatin was isolated from homozygous ge <dig> mutant pupae that also carry the hsp83:dctcf

like dctcf+, dctcfΔn and dctcfΔc occupancy at dctcf sites in bx-c and the bgl <dig> insulators was reduced compared to wild type . at most sites, the levels of dctcfΔn occupancy were very close to those for dctcf+. in contrast, dctcfΔc occupancy levels were in most instances slightly lower  than either dctcf+ or dctcfΔn. though the effects were small, they suggest that chromatin association of the dctcf c-terminal deletion was partially compromised. because this domain mediates interactions with cp <dig>  this finding would support the idea that dctcf binding to chromatin can be stabilized by interactions with cp <dig> 

cp <dig> occupancy requires dctcf but not necessarily the dctcf-ctd
we also tested whether the reductions in cp <dig> occupancy evident in ge <dig> mutants could be rescued by the hsp83:dctcf transgenes encoding the wild-type and mutant proteins. supporting the idea that dctcf functions in cp <dig> recruitment, we found that dctcf+ and dctcfΔn promote cp <dig> occupancy at sites bound by dctcf in vivo . for bx-c insulators the effects on cp <dig> occupancy seemed to correlate with the levels of the transgene dctcf associated with the insulator. for example, at mcp where the dctcf+ and dctcfΔn transgene proteins were present at only about half the level of the endogenous dctcf, cp <dig> occupancy was about 60 % of wild type . similarly at fab- <dig>  the transgene dctcf proteins and cp <dig> were present at levels about 30 % that of wild type. cp <dig> occupancy for two bgl <dig> insulators, 24c <dig> and 27b <dig>  also depended upon dctcf. in ge <dig> mutants, cp <dig> was not detected at either of these insulators, while association was restored by the dctcf+ and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the dctcfΔn transgenes. because the three other insulators  retained significant levels of both dctcf and cp <dig> in ge <dig> mutants, it was not clear whether dctcf is essential for cp <dig> occupancy or if it is one of several factors that contribute to cp190-insulator association. thus, though cp <dig> occupancy in dctcf+ and dctcfΔn flies at these three insulators was near wild type, the extent to which transgene dctcf protein contributed to the rescue was not entirely clear.

further insight into the role of dctcf in cp <dig> occupancy came from chips of dctcfΔc transgene embryos . there seemed to be three classes with respect to the requirement for the dctcf-ctd. in the first class were the bgl <dig> insulators 24c <dig> and 54b4r and also fab- <dig>  in this class, cp <dig> occupancy required the dctcf-ctd and was substantially reduced in dctcfΔc transgene flies compared to wild type or the two other dctcf rescue transgenes . the second class was represented by mcp and 27b <dig>  like 24c <dig>  54b4r and fab- <dig>  cp <dig> occupancy at these two insulators depended upon dctcf and was reduced to near-background levels in ge <dig> flies. however, unlike the insulators in the first class, the dctcfΔc transgene could partially rescue cp <dig> association. in the third class was the abd-b promoter. although cp <dig> occupancy at the abd-b promoter required dctcf , the requirement seemed to be independent of the dctcf-ctd and was fully rescued by the dctcfΔc transgene.

dctcf is required to properly initiate abd-b expression in the embryo
the visible phenotypic defects in ge <dig> adult flies arise from alterations in the patterns of gene expression induced by the gradual depletion of maternal dctcf as the animals develop. it seemed possible that the effects on gene regulation might differ if dctcf were completely absent at the onset of embryonic development instead of being present at near-normal levels and then slowly lost. to explore this possibility, we examined the expression of three genes, the homeotic gene abd-b, the segment polarity gene, engrailed   <cit> , and the notch pathway gene, insensitive   <cit>  in the progeny of ge <dig> mothers and fathers. unlike the progeny of heterozygous parents, these embryos lack both maternal and zygotic dctcf. because the greatly reduced fecundity of ge <dig> mothers made embryo collections problematic, we restricted our analysis to mid-embryogenesis.

the pattern of abd-b expression during mid-embryogenesis in wild-type embryos is dynamic  <cit> . in stage  <dig> germ band extended embryos, abd-b protein is expressed in parasegments ps <dig> and ps <dig>  while little or no protein is evident in more anterior parasegments. abd-b protein first begins to accumulate at detectable levels in more anterior parasegments towards the end of stage  <dig> at the onset of germ band retraction. only a low level of protein is initially observed in ps <dig>  as the germ band retracts, abd-b levels increase in ps <dig>  and protein begins to accumulate at detectable levels in ps <dig>  finally at the end of germ band retraction in stage  <dig>  low levels of abd-b are found in ps <dig>  panels e-g in fig.  <dig> show the pattern of abd-b expression in a stage  <dig> dctcfm-z- embryo. for the purposes of comparison, a slightly older stage  <dig> wild-type embryo is shown in panels a-c. abd-b expression in the dctcfm-z- embryo differed in two respects from wild type. first, the levels of abd-b in both ps <dig> and ps <dig> of the dctcfm-z- embryo were noticeably higher than that found in the corresponding parasegments of the wild-type embryo . second, while abd-b could not be detected in ps <dig> in the stage  <dig> wild-type embryo, it was prematurely expressed in ps <dig> in the stage  <dig> dctcfm-z- mutant embryo. the differences in both timing and level of expression seen in stage 10/ <dig> wild-type and dctcfm-z- embryos were also evident in older embryos. in the stage  <dig> wild-type embryo shown in fig. 9a,b, there was at most only a very low level of abd-b protein in ps <dig>  while abd-b did not appear to be expressed in ps <dig>  in contrast, abd-b was readily detected in both ps <dig> and ps <dig> of the dctcfm-z- embryo. moreover, protein could even be seen in a cluster of cells in ps <dig>  in addition to being prematurely expressed in more anterior parasegments, the level of abd-b protein in ps <dig> and ps <dig> was higher than that in the wild-type control  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression of abd-b and insv in stage 10/ <dig> wild-type and dctcf

the segment polarity gene en and the notch pathway gene insv were expressed in a stripe-like pattern in each parasegment in the ectoderm of wild-type germ band extended embryos; however, while all of the cells in the en stripes appeared to express essentially the same levels of en protein  only a subset of the cells in the insv stripes expressed insv . in the case of en, there were no obvious changes in the stripe pattern or in the level of protein in the cells expressing en in the dctcfm-z- mutant. in contrast, there was a substantial increase in the number of cells that expressed insv in dctcfm-z- embryos. the level of insv protein in these cells also appeared to be elevated. these changes were evident in both the stage  <dig> embryo in fig. 8h and the stage  <dig> embryo in fig. 9h.

we also examined the expression of abd-b in ge <dig> embryos rescued by the hsp83:dctcf+, hsp83:dctcfΔn, and hsp83:dctcfΔc transgenes. the pattern of abd-b expression in ge <dig> hsp83:dctcf+ transgenic embryos resembled wild type. this was also true for ge <dig> dctcfΔc transgenic embryos. in the case of hsp83:dctcfΔn, we occasionally observed stage 11– <dig> embryos that appeared to have slightly elevated levels of abd-b.

discussion
ctcf is one of only a few insulator/chromosomal architectural dna binding proteins that are known to be common to both insects and vertebrates  <cit> . while it has been implicated in a wide range of nuclear functions ranging from gene expression to recombination and replication, a thread that seems common to most of its known activities is one of organizing the chromatin fiber. with the aim of better understanding its biological activities, we have begun a systematic analysis of the drosophila melanogaster ctcf protein, dctcf. in the studies reported here we have focused on two modules in the protein, one that mediates multimerization of dctcf and the other that mediates interactions with the chromosomal protein cp <dig> 

using a combination of biochemical procedures we localized the dctcf multimerization module to the n-terminus of the protein, spanning a region of about  <dig> amino acids between  <dig> and  <dig>  at least part of this region  appears to be highly structured in solution as it is protease resistant. although further studies will be required, our data would be most consistent with a model in which the multimerization module mediates the formation of tetrameric rather than dimeric dctcf complexes. however, in either case, multimerization should enable dctcf to interact simultaneously with several closely spaced recognition motifs because is found in insulators like fab- <dig>  fab- <dig>  and fab- <dig>  presumably this could stabilize dctcf association with chromatin by increasing the half-life of the protein–dna complex. alternatively, or in addition, the dctcf multimers could bind simultaneously to dctcf sites in different insulators, generating a chromatin loop linked together at its base by the insulator bound dctcf multimeric complexes. a direct linkage of distant dctcf binding sites by the dctcf multimers would be consistent with the insulator bypass experiments using pairs of the appropriately oriented multimerized dctcf binding sites  <cit> . like its insect counterpart, the vertebrate ctcf protein has also been implicated in the formation of chromatin loops  <cit> . because vertebrate ctcf is capable of self-association  <cit> , it is possible that distant ctcf binding sites are linked together via some sort of ctcf multimeric complex. however, unlike the ntd of the drosophila protein, biochemical studies suggest that the ntd of vertebrate ctcf is monomeric and disordered  <cit> . thus, multimer formation would have to involve other domains. in this regard it is of interest that pant et al.  <cit>  found pairwise interactions between the c-terminal zinc finger domains of the vertebrate ctcf protein.

we also analyzed how dctcf and cp <dig> interact with each other. yeast two-hybrid experiments and gst-pull-downs map the cp <dig> interaction module of dctcf to the ctd. for cp <dig>  the primary dctcf interaction module was associated with the cp <dig> btb domain. previous studies have shown that the cp <dig> btb domain forms a highly stable dimer  <cit> . if there is a one-to-one relationship between the dctcf-ctd–cp <dig> interaction module and the cp <dig> btb domain, this cp <dig> btb dimer could link two dctcf multimers together, potentially building higher order protein–dna complexes. however, our experiments do not favor a one-to-one interaction between dctcf and cp <dig>  instead, our results would support a model in which a single dctcf-ctd–cp <dig> interaction module associates preferentially with a dimerized cp <dig> btb domain to give a 2xbtbcp190:dctcf-ctd heterotrimer. this appears to be true, at least in these in vitro experiments, even when dctcf is present in excess. though confirmation will require a direct structural analysis of the dctcf–cp <dig> complex, these findings would argue that the btb dimer of cp <dig>  by itself, could not function as the bridge linking two distant dctcf insulators together. however, cp <dig> has additional domains  that are involved in interaction with the dna binding proteins like the insulator protein zipic  <cit> . thus, cp <dig> might form complexes with or bridges between different insulator proteins like zipic and dctcf that might stabilize binding to chromatin. because cp <dig> has a sequence non-specific zinc finger dna bd  <cit> , an alternative function for cp <dig> might be to stabilize dctcf association with chromatin by binding  to sequences adjacent to dctcf binding sites. however, because there are only very modest effects at most on dctcf occupancy when the c-terminal dctcf cp <dig> interaction domain is deleted, such a function would not seem to be critical.

to complement these biochemical studies, we examined the functioning of the dctcf multimerization and cp <dig> interaction modules in vivo. previous studies have shown that maternally derived dctcf is sufficient to sustain development through to the adult stage  <cit> . however, the viability of homozygous ge <dig> animals, which lack zygotic dctcf, was significantly reduced and the surviving adult flies exhibited several characteristic phenotypes. these included thin bristles, held out wings, abdominal segmentation defects, a substantially reduced egg production, and a maternal effect lethality. we found that an hsp <dig> transgene expressing the wild-type protein rescued all but two of the phenotypic effects of the ge <dig> mutation. the two exceptions were the held out wing phenotype and the presence, in a small fraction of the hsp83:dctcfwt adults, of a weak a <dig>  to a <dig>  transformation. it seems likely these two remaining phenotypes were due to the fact that the level of dctcf expressed by the transgene is less than that produced by the endogenous gene. in the case of the a <dig> to a <dig> transformation, this suggestion fits with both the roughly tenfold reduction in dctcf occupancy at the fab- <dig> insulator and the known role of this insulator in abd-b regulation. fab- <dig> functions to protect the abd-b cis-regulatory domain specifying ps <dig> , iab- <dig>  from the adjacent ps <dig> cis-regulatory domain, iab- <dig>  <cit> . when only reduced levels of dctcf are present, it is possible that polycomb group  complexes may spread into iab- <dig> from iab- <dig> silencing the iab- <dig> cis-regulatory domain inappropriately in ps <dig> 

somewhat surprisingly, a dctcf protein, dctcfΔc, lacking sequences in the ctd critical for interactions with cp <dig> was just about as effective as the wild-type protein in complementing the ge <dig> mutant. like wild type, it rescued the zygotic and maternal effect lethality, the egg production defect, and the bristle phenotypes, but not the held out wing or the a <dig> to a <dig> transformation. chip experiments were consistent with the idea that cp <dig> interactions may help stabilize dctcf association with chromatin because dctcf occupancy levels were reduced in hsp83:dctcfΔc pupae  at most of the insulators we examined. while the effects of the mutation on dctcf occupancy were modest, much greater reductions in cp <dig> levels were evident at least at some sites . at these sites it would appear that cp <dig> occupancy required the dctcf c-terminal cp <dig> interaction module. however, this was not always the case. for example, at mcp, the presence of the mutant dctcfΔc protein was sufficient to ensure cp <dig> occupancy . because cp <dig> occupancy at mcp required dctcf , it would appear that dctcf can promote cp <dig> association by a mechanism that is independent of its c-terminal cp <dig> interaction module. recently, pita was found to bind mcp and recruit cp <dig>  <cit> . the binding of the two proteins to mcp are interdependent. one obvious possibility is that dctcfΔc binding to mcp stabilizes the association of pita, which in turn can recruit cp <dig> 

while the dctcfΔc protein was just about as effective as wild-type dctcf in rescuing the ge <dig>  this was not true for dctcfΔn. this mutant protein only partially ameliorated the zygotic and maternal effect lethality, and surviving adult flies exhibited the same visible phenotypes as the ge <dig> mutant. because occupancy levels of the dctcfΔn protein were nearly equivalent to that of dctcfwt, it would appear that some other activity of the dctcf protein must be partially compromised by the deletion of the multimerization domain. one possibility would be a function in linking distant dctcf insulators together; however, this region of the protein could have other activities besides mediating dctcf dimerization. importantly, because cp <dig> occupancy at bx-c insulators and the abd-b promoter was similar to that in hsp83:dctcfwt, abd-b-dependent abdominal phenotypes in adult hsp83:dctcfΔn flies  may arise by a mechanism that is independent of cp <dig> 

because there is a substantial maternal contribution of dctcf, the abdominal segmentation defects in surviving ge <dig> flies were likely a consequence of a gradual reduction in dctcf occupancy at the abd-b insulators and/or promoter as the animals developed. significantly, eliminating dctcf at the onset of embryonic development had a quite different effect on abd-b gene activity. instead of being reduced, abd-b expression was substantially upregulated in the posterior parasegments of dctcfm-z- embryos. these paradoxical effects on abd-b regulation would not be consistent with a primary function for dctcf in the intrinsic activity of the abd-b promoter—the adult phenotype would require dctcf to function as an activator, while the embryonic phenotype would require dctcf to function as a repressor. rather, one would imagine that whatever role dctcf plays at the abd-b promoter , this function is likely to be the same throughout development. for this reason, the opposing stage-specific effects on abd-b activity are more readily explained by the quite different modes of regulation of the abd-b  cis-regulatory domains in embryos and in larvae/pupae  <cit> .

in larvae and pupae, abd-b regulation is in the maintenance phase and depends upon the pres in each iab cis-regulatory domain . the pres function to recruit pcg proteins, keeping inactive cis-regulatory domains off in the parasegments where they should be silenced. for this reason, a gradual reduction in insulator activity in the larval and pupal stages could result in the spreading of pcg silencing from pres in inactive cis-regulatory domains to their flanking active neighbors and the consequent downregulation of abd-b gene activity in posterior parasegments. . by contrast, in dctcfm-z- embryos, dctcf would be absent when the gap and pair-rule genes initially establish the parasegment-specific patterns of abd-b gene activity during the blastoderm–early gastrula stage . at this point in development one of the key functions of insulators is to prevent cross talk between the adjacent parasegment-specific initiation elements that can inappropriately activate or silence the cis-regulatory domains flanking the insulator  <cit> . for mutations that disrupt specific insulators, this mix of ectopic activation and silencing can be visualized in the embryo by changes in the level of abd-b expression  <cit> . for example, in fab- <dig> mutants, the inappropriate activation of the iab- <dig> cis-regulatory domain in ps <dig> would noticeably upregulate abd-b expression in this parasegment compared to that in wild type where iab- <dig> normally directs abd-b expression  <cit> . however, the level of abd-b expression in ps <dig> in the fab- <dig> mutant is not equivalent to that in the adjacent parasegment ps <dig> because in some of the ps <dig> cells the iab- <dig> cis-regulatory domain is inappropriately silenced. in fact, this is the phenotype that we observed in dctcfm-z- mutant embryos. abd-b expression is each posterior parasegment was upregulated compared to the corresponding parasegment in wild type, but the extent of upregulation was not equivalent to that in the adjacent more posterior parasegments.

while the opposing phenotypes associated with the loss dctcf activity at different stages of development argue in favor of the idea that dctcf is critical to the functioning of the insulators associated with the abd-b cis-regulatory domains, there was one rather puzzling observation—namely, the apparent effects of the dctcf ge <dig> mutation on the activity of the fab- <dig> insulator. in adult ge <dig> flies, the partial transformation of a <dig>  into a <dig>  would point either to a loss of abd-b promoter activity or the spreading of silencing from iab- <dig> pre into iab- <dig>  shutting off this cis-regulatory domain in ps <dig> . in the embryo, the upregulation of abd-b expression in ps <dig> would require either an increase in abd-b promoter activity or the ectopic activation of iab- <dig> by the iab- <dig> initiator in ps <dig> cells. while these stage-specific phenotypic effects are more readily explained by a disruption in fab- <dig> insulator activity rather than diametrically opposite effects on the abd-b promoter as development proceeds, fab- <dig> differs from the other abd-b insulators in that it does not have dctcf binding sites  <cit> . in this case, the apparent loss of fab- <dig> insulator activity would have to be an indirect consequence of disruptions in the functioning of the neighboring dctcf-dependent insulators, fab- <dig> and fab- <dig>  although transgene assays have argued that the activity of an insulator depends upon its neighbors , this would be one of the first examples in an endogenous setting. further studies will clearly be required to explain the apparent effects on fab- <dig> activity.

additionally, we found that the expression of the notch pathway gene, insv, was also changed in dctcfm-z- embryos, while en expression seemed to be unaffected. unlike abd-b, where there are good reasons to believe that the effects on gene regulation are a direct consequence of the loss of dctcf activity, we do not know whether the effects on insv are direct or indirect. however, it is worth noting that the insv gene and its partner, elba <dig>  are flanked by sequences that are bound by dctcf, while the potential insulators for the en locus appear to be occupied by su rather than dctcf  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
ctcf is one of the few dna binding insulator proteins that is conserved in bilaterians. to learn more about its role in chromosome architecture we have identified and characterized the two protein–protein interaction modules in drosophila dctcf. the first is responsible for the multimerization of the dctcf protein while the second is responsible for interactions between dctcf and cp <dig>  we have also tested the functioning of proteins lacking these interaction modules in vivo. we found that a dctcf protein lacking sequences critical for cp <dig> interactions was almost as effective as wild type in rescuing the phenotypic effects of a dctcf null allele. in contrast, a dctcf protein lacking the multimerization domain had only partial functionality and did not fully rescue phenotypic effects of the null allele.
