BACKGROUND
gonadal sex differentiation in vertebrate embryos involves sexually dimorphic gene expression, leading to ovarian or testicular development. while a number of key gonadal differentiation genes have been identified and validated in a variety of organisms, large gaps in our understanding still exist  <cit> . this likely underlies the significant number of human disorders of sex development  that remain unexplained at the genetic level  <cit> . identification of novel regulators of embryonic ovarian and testis differentiation is therefore required, and will greatly improve our understanding of normal and aberrant gonad sexual differentiation. the chicken embryo provides a unique model system for studying gonad development because development occurs in ovo , allowing gonadal development to be directly manipulated  <cit> . in chickens and other birds, as in mammals, sex is determined by sex chromosome inheritance. however, birds have a zz male: zw female sex chromosome system, which is the opposite of the xy male: xx female system found in mammals. genes located on the sex chromosomes drive differentiation of the “bipotential” gonads into ovaries  or testes . several key genes involved in mammalian gonadal sex differentiation are conserved in chicken, including male up-regulated dmrt <dig>  sox <dig> and amh, and female up-regulated aromatase, foxl <dig> and wnt4/rspo <dig> . however, the y-chromosome linked sry gene, which initiates testis development in mammals, is absent in birds. the best candidate master sex switch in birds is dmrt <dig>  which is present on the z sex chromosome and is expressed more highly in male gonads compared to females prior to and during sexual differentiation. knockdown and over-expression of dmrt <dig> causes feminisation and masculinisation of the gonads respectively  <cit> . although a w-linked female  determinant may yet exist, our extensive analysis has so far not produced a convincing candidate gene  <cit> .

in chicken embryos, the gonads form on the medioventral surface of the mesonephric kidneys at embryonic day  <dig>   <cit> . at this stage, they are undifferentiated or “bipotential”. at e <dig> , gonads begin morphological differentiation into testes in zz embryos or unilateral ovary in zw embryos. sex-specific gonadal morphology emerges at this time, and a small number of genes showing sexually dimorphic expression have been identified, notably the ovarian determinants foxl <dig> and aromatase in females  <cit> , and dmrt <dig>  hemogen and sox <dig> in males . however, in chicken, the exact functional relationships among these genes are unclear. furthermore, human dsd’s imply the existence of other as yet unidentified gonad-determining genes in vertebrates generally.

previous screens in the mouse embryo have employed various methods to isolate novel genes regulating gonadal sex differentiation, such as high throughput whole mount in situ hybridization   <cit> , differential display  <cit> , cdna subtractive hybridization  cdna microarrays  <cit>  and rna-seq on sorted germ cells  <cit> . however, technical limitations often mean that these approaches assay only a small fraction of the transcriptome, and some studies have sampled stages when the gonads are larger but when differentiation has already occurred. nevertheless, several of these large-scale studies have successfully identified hundreds of genes with sexually dimorphic expression in embryonic mouse gonads. a microarray study on sorted gonadal somatic cells  from  <dig>  and  <dig> dpc found numerous sex-biased genes specific to the early differentiating sertoli and granulosa cells  <cit> . another study used microarrays on gonadal somatic cells to identify  <dig> genes expressed in a sex-specific manner prior to, during and after gonadal sex differentiation   <cit> . an independent microarray screen compared sorted supporting cells , interstitial or stromal cells  and germ cells  from xy and xx mouse gonads at e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> . these studies as well as the others mentioned above identified novel candidates such as aard, cst <dig>  mmd <dig>  cbln <dig>  some of which have been further characterised in gonad development . whilst these studies represent extensive transcriptome profiling of embryonic gonads, deep rna sequencing  is considerably more sensitive  <cit> . in addition, rna-seq reveals expression for all mrnas, not only genes covered by microarray, allowing an unbiased analysis.

in the current study, rna-seq is used to assess sex-biased gene expression at the onset gonadal sex differentiation in embryonic chicken gonads. our rationale is based on the assumption that genes important for ovary versus testis development will show sex-biased expression. we previously performed rna sequencing on e <dig>  gonads, at the bi-potential stage prior to sexual differentiation  <cit> . by comparing gene expression from this early stage to e <dig> , we find novel genes and pathways that are activated sex-specifically at the time of sexual differentiation; more than  <dig> genes are transcribed in a sex-biased manner at this stage, and the majority of these become biased between e <dig>  and e <dig>  this is primarily due to an increased expression of autosomal, rather than sex-linked, genes between these time points. gene ontology and pathway analysis indicate that these genes are involved in extracellular signalling as well as driving morphological changes such as ecm, cytoskeletal remodelling and tubulogenesis. we also find significant enrichment of genes reported in the embryonic mouse gonadal screens in the genes identified in our chicken screen, highlighting conservation of molecular mechanisms underlying gonad differentiation. several novel candidate gonadal sex differentiation genes are identified and validated in vivo. three female-biased  genes are further characterised; calpain- <dig> , g-protein coupled receptor  <dig> , and fgfr <dig> . these genes may play an important role during ovarian development. this study provides insight into the earliest steps of gonad sex differentiation, and identifies novel candidate genes for ovarian and testis development.

RESULTS
significant sex-biased gene expression in early differentiating gonads 
to assess gene expression in the early differentiating testes and ovaries, paired gonads from e <dig>  were dissected and mrna isolated as previously described  <cit> . for each sex,  <dig> pools of  <dig> gonad pairs  were collected. messenger rna was then processed and sequenced , resulting in an average of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> read pairs per sample. we have previously performed the same analysis on e <dig>  paired gonads  <cit> . expression for each gene and differential expression  analysis were then calculated . gene expression is calculated in fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped . significance is calculated using false discovery rate  .

rna-seq analysis detected expression of  <dig> genes. as the gonads begin to differentiate at e <dig>  a total of  <dig> genes showed significant de between the sexes . of these,  <dig> were female-biased and  <dig> were male-biased . in contrast, at the earlier time point of e <dig> , when the gonads are morphologically undifferentiated, only  <dig> genes were significantly de  . thus, between e <dig>  and e <dig> as the gonads begin to differentiate, a four-fold increase in sexually dimorphic transcript number was observed . substantial overlap was observed between the genes that were sexually de at e <dig>  and those at e6;  <dig> genes in males and  <dig> in females  . indeed, of the  <dig> de genes at e <dig> , only  <dig>  lost this bias at e <dig>  and the majority of these  reside on the sex chromosomes   <cit> . this may reflect changes in dosage compensation of these sex chromosome genes or changes in the expression of w linked genes .fig.  <dig> sexually dimorphic gene expression in the bi-potential and differentiating chicken embryonic gonads. a venn diagrams indicating the number of significantly de  genes for each time-point . this is divided into male-biased  and female-biased .  <dig> genes were male biased at e <dig> , and  <dig> at e <dig>  of these,  <dig> genes were de at both time points, with only  <dig> genes being de at only e <dig> .  <dig> genes were de in a female biased manner at e <dig> , and  <dig> at e <dig>   <dig> of these were de at both time points. b a heatmap of the top  <dig> de genes for each sample . the colour scale indicates the proportion of counts in each sample with respect to the sum across samples, after normalising for library size. with red indicating the highest expression relative to other samples and dark blue being the least. on the left is hierarchical clustering of these genes. the known w-linked genes are indicated by pink lines while the z-linked genes are indicated by blue lines. c the number of de genes  found on the autosomes  versus the sex chromosomes , for each time point



hierarchical clustering was performed on the  <dig> most significantly de genes  from e <dig>  and e <dig> gonads. the clustering of genes on the basis of expression level is represented in a heat map . w-linked genes clustered together and showed high differential expression in both female samples at both time-points , consistent with our previous observations  <cit> . similarly, z-linked genes clustered together. importantly, autosomal genes that were de were primarily present in e <dig> and not e <dig>  gonads, with female de genes clustering together for each sample and male de genes clustering. the overall number of de sex-linked genes did not greatly change between the time-points . this indicates that the increase in biased genes expression between e <dig>  and e <dig> was largely due to transcriptional changes in autosomal genes, which increased from  <dig> de genes at e <dig>   to  <dig>  at e <dig> . taken together, these data show that between e <dig>  and e <dig>  there was a significant increase in the number of autosomal genes showing sexually dimorphic expression. these genes are novel candidates for contributing to gonad sexual differentiation.

known sex-differentiation genes show dimorphic expression
the expression profiles of known or putative regulators of gonadal sexual differentiation were assessed at e <dig>  and e <dig> . of the known sexual regulators based on previous studies in chicken or mammals, only one autosomal gene was significantly de at e <dig>  in females; foxl <dig> . at e <dig>  foxl <dig> continued to be differentially expressed, and in addition cyp19a1/aromatase, hsd17b <dig> and nrob <dig>  transcripts became female enriched . four genes showed significantly male-biased expression at both time-points; hsd17b <dig>  dmrt <dig>  hemogen, and amh . inhibin a and b trended towards sexual dimorphism  at e <dig> , and by e <dig> both were significantly male-enriched . sox <dig> showed male-biased expression at e <dig> only, confirming previous studies suggesting that it lies downstream of z-linked genes dmrt <dig> and hemogen  <cit> . these data imply that major components of the sex determination pathways are activated between e <dig>  and e <dig> . several other sex-development genes show gonadal expression but no sexual dimorphism . indeed, many known regulators of bipotential gonad formation such as lhx <dig>  emx <dig>  gata <dig> and fog <dig> were very highly expressed in both female and male e <dig>  gonads, while expression decreased significantly in e <dig> gonads . this confirms that the e <dig>  gonads are still undifferentiated, whereas at e <dig> the differentiation process has commenced, reflected by down-regulation of genes required for the formation of the undifferentiated gonad and up-regulation of sex-differentiation genes.table  <dig> expression of known and putative sex genes in embryonic chicken gonads, revealed by rna-seq

the expression of known or implicated sex genes in the female and male gonads, at e <dig>  and e <dig>  expression is measured in fpkm . p-values  indicate whether the difference between females and males is significant, and fem:male fold-change  is the difference between females sample expression and male samples expression. genes are ranked in terms of their fc at e <dig>  those in bold are significantly different  < <dig> ) between sexes at e6



while no rna-seq analysis has yet been reported for whole embryonic mouse gonads, large-scale transcriptional screens have been carried out  <cit> . to assess conservation of sexually dimorphic genes in other organisms, chicken de genes at e <dig>  were compared with those from three separate large-scale mouse microarray screens  <cit> . the first of these studies assayed somatic cells from xx and xy embryonic mouse gonads at e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig> , with e <dig>  –  <dig>  being equivalent to chicken e <dig>   <cit> . the second study used isolated somatic cells from xx and xy gonads at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpc and identified genes showing male up-regulation or down-regulation specific to  <dig> dpc, as well as female up-regulation at  <dig> dpc  <cit> . in the third study, isolated supporting cells, stromal/interstitials cells and germ cells were profiled from xx and xy mice  <cit> . all three of these studies used different methods of assessing differential expression, but all used a p-value of  <dig>  to assess de genes at each time point. to compare our data to these studies, we used a p-value of  <dig>  to find e <dig> de genes in the chicken. this results in a list of  <dig> genes. this gene list was then compared with those identified as sex-biased at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpc from nef et al.  <cit>  and jameson et al.  <cit> , and with those identified in the other study  <cit> . fisher’s exact tests were also carried out to test for statistically significant enrichment of each data set in our set. when we compared each data set to our de gene list we found significant enrichment  for each study . our rna-seq study was carried out on whole gonads, and will hence encompass expression from various populations of cells include supporting cells and germ cells. by comparing to each cell lineage from the jameson et al. study, we could also see that de genes associated with supporting cell , and interstitial cells  are represented in our data set at a significant level . germ cells were enriched with a p-value of  <dig>  . overall, we found  <dig> genes in common between the three mouse studies alones  . of these,  <dig> genes were also de in our study . thus significant overlap between differentiating mouse and chickens gonads was observed, suggesting that similar genetic pathways are engaged between mammals and avians, validating the use of chicken embryonic gonads to screen for novel sex determination candidates.table  <dig> genes found in additional mouse gonadal screens

 <dig> genes were common between all studies of somatic cells and our study . these genes were col14a <dig>  cyp11a <dig>  ogt, slc20a <dig>  lect <dig>  nedd <dig>  prss <dig>  fst, hpse, gpm6b, tesc, atp1a <dig>  dapk <dig>  adm, scarb <dig>  mef2c, tyro <dig>  gdnf, bace <dig> and nac <dig>  some of these genes have been implicated in sex development previously. cyp11a <dig> mutations cause congenital adrenal insufficiency and with partial or complete  <dig> xy sex reversal in humans. gdnf or glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor exerts a proliferative effect on developing mouse sertoli cells  <cit> . finally, tescalin  has been previously described as an early testis gene  <cit> , although no gonadal phenotypes have been described in a null mutant mouse  <cit> . we also analysed the overlap between these studies and our dataset using a p-value cut off of  <dig>  to determine de genes. this dataset has  <dig> genes, half of what we have using the less stringent p-value of  <dig> . consistently, we found reduced numbers of overlapping genes, but enrichment was still significant between all groups .

transcriptional changes in the differentiating gonads reflect morphological differentiation
to elucidate novel pathways engaged during sexual differentiation of ovaries and testes, pathway analysis was performed on the dataset. to this end, genes were filtered that were only sexually dimorphic at e <dig> , but not in the undifferentiated gonads . genes previously implicated in sex determination or differentiation were removed, to reveal novel activated pathways. gene ontology  analysis was carried out on this list of  <dig> genes  using david  <cit> . we assessed three ontological categories: biological process , cellular component  and molecular function  . the top  <dig> bp categories in de genes were tube development, cell proliferation and respiratory tube development. the ccs most represented were extracellular and cell surface. the mfs were lipid binding, growth factor activity and atpase activity .table  <dig> gene ontology and kegg pathway analysis of gonad differentiation candidates

genes showing de expression at e <dig> but not at e <dig>  were analysed for gene ontology and kegg pathway enrichment using david software  <cit> . the top  <dig> gene ontology categories for biological process, cellular component and molecular function are shown, along with the gene count, percentage of total genes input and the p-value. the top  <dig> kegg pathways are shown for the same data set



to assess the probable functions of the genes in this data set, we used david functional analysis of kegg pathways  <cit> . the top five kegg pathways that were significantly engaged  were focal adhesion, dorsal-ventral axis formation, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, ecm-receptor interaction, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction . numerous de genes were implicated in each of these pathways . the high number of genes involved in extracellular function and in the engagement of pathways involved in actin cytoskeletal remodelling and ecm function is consistent with the significant morphological changes that are taking place as the gonads differentiate into ovaries or testis. indeed, the embryonic ovary and testis differ significantly in their morphology; the ovary develops a thickened cortex to house germ cells, while the medulla becomes fragmented, and the testis organizes into basement membrane bound seminiferous cords that enclose germ cells and supporting sertoli cells. these morphological events begin at e <dig>  vasculature and seminiferous cord development are important in the testis  <cit> , which was reflected here in the number of genes implicated in tube formation and development. panther pathway analysis also revealed that the tgf-β pathway was significantly represented , including bmp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and bmpr <dig> as well as jun and myostatin. indeed, bmp signalling has been implicated in ovarian and follicle development , although the exact role of these bmps at this early stage needs to be elucidated.

novel candidates for testis and ovarian development
known sex determination genes were effectively identified from the rna-seq data set, many of which had sexually dimorphic expression only at e <dig>  based on this analysis, the sequencing data was interrogated to identify novel genes involved in chicken gonadal sex differentiation. for potential testis-determining genes, the data was filtered for genes showing sexually dimorphic expression at e <dig>  which were male biased  and with a male gonadal expression of more than  <dig> fpkm. fpkm of  <dig> was chosen as a cut-off based on the expression of known gonad genes and on previous studies in our lab that suggest in vivo methods such as wish do not detect the expression of genes with less than this value . these testis genes were ranked according to p-value and the top  <dig> genes were tabulated . this list includes previously mentioned known sex-regulators such as dmrt <dig>  hemogen, amh and sox <dig>  from this list, four candidate genes were chosen for further study, based on gene ontology and expression. specifically we chose genes with a variety of expression levels/fold changes, and which are thought to be involved in transcriptional regulation or morphogenesis/cell differentiation. these were laminin <dig> , bmp receptor  <dig> , zinc-finger 385b  and a novel, uncharacterised gene on the z chromosome that we designated nzp . to identify genes involved in ovarian development, genes were filtered for significant sexual dimorphism at e <dig> , female bias  and with a female expression greater than fpkm  <dig>  all w-linked genes were removed as these have been analyzed previously  <cit> , and the remaining genes were ranked according to p-value , and the top  <dig> taken. from this list, three novel candidate genes for ovarian development were chosen based on their expression profiles and on their gene ontology. these were calpain- <dig> , g-protein coupled receptor  <dig>  and fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  .table  <dig> rna-seq expression of novel candidates for in vivo validation

expression  is shown for female and males gonads at e <dig>  and e <dig>  with p-values  for the sex differences  and the fold change between sexes



whole-mount in situ hybridisation  of chicken embryonic urogenital systems  at e <dig> was used to confirm mrna expression of the seven candidate genes . by this method, genes could be assessed for their degree of gonad specificity, and their expression could be localised to a gonadal cell type. wish confirmed male-biased expression in the e <dig> gonads for all four of the testis candidate genes; lama <dig>  bmpr <dig>  znf385b, and nzp . over-staining and sectioning showed that all four of these genes were expressed in the seminiferous cords of the developing testis . bmpr <dig>  znf385b and nzp had only low level, diffuse expression in the ovary , while lama <dig> had expression in the juxta-cortical medulla of the ovary . none of these genes were notably expressed at other sites within the urogenital system.fig.  <dig> male candidate gene expression in vivo. whole mount in situ hybridisation for  <dig> male-biased candidate genes, on e <dig> ugs  from males and females. bmpr <dig> is more highly expressed in males  than in females . in over-stained sections, bmpr <dig> appears to be expressed in the testis cords . znf385b shows greater expression in males  than females , consistent with rna-seq. in males it is expressed in the cords . nzp, a novel z-protein, is expressed in males more highly than females . it is also expressed in the cords of males . lama <dig> is also higher in males  than females  and is expressed in testis cords in males , with some weak expression in the juxta-cortical medulla in females . these results are consistent with rna-seq data. typically,  <dig> ugs from each sex were used for each probe, and these images are representative. a sense control probe did not show any staining for any of the candidate genes 

fig.  <dig> female candidate genes expression in vivo. whole mount in situ hybridisation for  <dig> female-biased candidate genes, on e <dig> ugs from males and females. capn <dig> is more highly expressed in female  than in males, where only low staining is observed . capn <dig> is also expressed in the adrenal glands in both females and males . in over-stained sections capn <dig> appears to be expressed in the juxta-cortical medulla of the ovary . gpr <dig> shows strong expression in female gonads  and no expression in the males , consistent with rna-seq. in females it is expressed in the cortex of the ovary, with a lower level in the medulla . fgfr <dig> is also higher in females  than males, which show low expression . fgfr <dig> is mostly expressed in the ovarian cortex , and in the male weakly in a subset of cord cells . these results are consistent with rna-seq data. typically,  <dig> ugs from each sex were used for each probe, and these images are representative of what is seen. a sense control probe is also tested, and did not show any staining for any of the genes 



all three candidate ovarian genes showed strong female-biased expression at e <dig>    in wish. capn <dig> and gpr <dig> were strongly expressed in female gonads but only weakly expressed in males . gpr <dig> and fgfr <dig> had no expression in other sites within the urogenital system, while capn <dig> showed expression in the adrenal glands of both males and females . sectioning revealed that capn <dig> was expressed in a subset of medullary cells close to the cortex – the juxta-cortical medulla . gpr <dig> and fgfr <dig> were expressed primarily in the cortex of the ovary . taken together these results indicate that the gonad rna-seq data was robustly validated by in situ hybridisation.

novel sex-differentiation candidates show altered expression following experimental sex-reversal of gonads
rna-seq and wish analysis revealed the expression of three female- and four male-biased gonadal genes. to test the involvement of these genes in the gonadal differentiation pathways, experimental sex reversal was carried out using the aromatase inhibitor, fadrozole. fadrozole inhibits the activity of the aromatase enzyme, blocking oestrogen production, and resulting in female to male sex reversal of the embryonic gonads  <cit> . fadrozole was injected into fertile eggs at e <dig>  and gonads were harvested from embryos at e <dig> . wish was used to compare gene expression to that of stage-matched controls.

the male-biased genes, bmpr <dig> and znf385b  were up-regulated in sex-reversed females  compared to control females , suggesting that the expression of these is a consequence of male sex differentiation. while nzp also showed up-regulation in the treated female , expression of this gene is low at this time-point in both sexes . similarly, lama <dig> expression was weaker in the male at this time point, and only a weak activation was observed in the female treated with fadrozole . further functional analysis of these three candidate testis genes is currently underway. antibodies have been raised against znf385b and knockdown is being conducted using our established virally delivered rnai approach  <cit> . the female-biased genes capn <dig> , gpr <dig>  and fgfr <dig>  all showed down-regulation in fadrozole treated female gonads  compared to the untreated female. in gpr <dig>  only the left gonad of females showed robust expression at this point . this was lost in fadrozole treated gonads . these data show that these genes are expressed in female-specific cell types as a consequence of the early steps of ovarian differentiation. their expression is subsequently lost when ovaries are sex reversed. these data indicate that the rna-seq screen was used to successfully identify candidate genes for ovarian or testis development. as our interest lies in identifying novel genes involved in ovary differentiation, we further focused on capn <dig>  gpr <dig> and fgfr <dig> fig.  <dig> expression of candidate genes is altered in sex-reversed gonads. whole mount in situ of e <dig> ugs from male controls, female controls or fadrozole treated females. the expression of male candidate genes bmpr <dig>  and znf385b  changed dramatically in fadrozole treated embryos , where expression was almost at the same level as untreated males . nzp also had increased expression in treated females  compared to untreated , although expression of this gene has generally dropped in control males at this stage . lama <dig> expression had also dropped in males at e <dig> , and only low expression was found in females . a slight increase in expression was seen in treated females . capn <dig> was lost from the gonads  but not the adrenal gland of treated females  compared to control females  . in the gonads it obtained a similar level of expression to control males . gpr <dig>  which is absent in males , was also lost from treated females  whereas in untreated females it is strongly expressed in the left ovary . similarly, fadrozole treatment abolished fgfr <dig> staining in the gonads , to a similar level as untreated males  from normal strong expression in females 



candidate ovarian genes are translated during gonad development
only a small number of genes have so far been shown to play a deterministic role in ovarian differentiation and development  <cit> . screens such as the one described here provide additional candidate genes, which will fill gaps in our understanding of ovarian morphogenesis. therefore we focused on the female-biased candidates fgfr <dig>  capn <dig> and gpr <dig>  fgfr <dig> is a receptor for fibroblast growth factors  which have been shown to play a central role in gonad differentiation and germ cell development . a role for fgfr <dig> has not been described in the ovary during embryogenesis. calpain- <dig>  encodes an intracellular calcium-dependent cysteine protease, and has similarity to the caenorhabditis elegans sex determination gene tra- <dig>  capn <dig> has not been implicated in gonad development in vertebrates. gpr <dig> is an adhesion-associated g-protein coupled receptor that mediates intracellular signal transduction. gpr <dig> null mice have impaired testis formation and infertility  <cit> . no phenotype has been reported in female mice.

to study these proteins, a commercial antibody was used for fgfr <dig> and in-house antibodies were raised against capn <dig> and gpr <dig> proteins. these new antibodies were tested for specificity . to this end, open reading frames of chicken capn <dig> and gpr <dig> were cloned and expressed them in a chicken fibroblastic cell line . two polyclonal antibodies were tested for each protein, at various concentrations . for gpr <dig>  while low background staining was observed in untransfected df <dig> cells , strong expression was observed when transfection with the gpr <dig> plasmid was carried out . this staining appeared to be cytoplasmic, excluded from the nucleus . capn <dig> specific staining is observed only in the transfected cells and not in the control cells , and it appears punctate throughout the cytoplasm . these antibodies were then used to assay expression in embryonic gonads. capn <dig> was detected in female gonads at e <dig> in a subset of cells in the medulla. by e <dig>   this expression had increased and was evident in a subset of juxta-cortical medullary cells . capn <dig> appeared to be cytoplasmic in these cells . this protein expression pattern was consistent with the mrna expression pattern. some low level punctate staining was observed in the males from e <dig>  . gpr <dig> was also expressed from e <dig>   in the female, with only background staining in the male. expression of gpr <dig> was highest in the cortex of the ovary where it appeared to be cytoplasmic and at the plasma membrane .  the fgfr <dig> antibody detected protein in the germ cells in both sexes , where it is cytoplasmic or at the plasma membrane . staining was stronger in the ovary , especially in the cortex , which may reflect its expression in somatic cortical cells as well as germ cells.fig.  <dig> novel candidate female genes are translated in the embryonic gonads. immunofluorescence staining using antibodies raised in house  or commercial antibodies  in e <dig> gonads. capn <dig> protein is only weakly expressed in males , but shows high expression in a subset of cells in the female gonads . these cells are present in the juxta-cortical medulla, and staining appears cytoplasmic . gpr <dig> is expressed in the cortex of the female , where it appears cytoplasmic, although this staining is weak, and gpr <dig> is weak in male gonads . fgfr <dig> is expressed in the male gonads  and in the female gonads , where it is strongly expressed in the membrane or cytosol of the germ cells . strong staining in the female cortex  is probably due to germ cell expression, although may also be due to additional cortical cells expressing this receptor



the female-biased expression of these proteins, especially capn <dig> and gpr <dig>  indicates that they might play a role in ovarian development from the time of sexual differentiation, and further validates rna-seq as a useful tool for the identification of novel candidate gonad differentiation genes. further studies including functional analysis are currently underway in our laboratory to assess the precise role of these genes.

discussion
sexual differentiation of the gonads during embryonic development involves the sex-biased expression and action of several well-characterised regulators of ovarian or testicular development. however, only a small number of genes have been identified and many cases of unexplained human dsds point to the existence of uncharacterised genetic regulators of embryonic gonadal development. rna-seq was employed here to identify novel candidate sex genes, using embryonic chicken gonads as a model system. this study is the first to report rna-seq in entire gonads at the time of sexual differentiation in a vertebrate species. we have combined previous analysis of female and male gonads at e <dig> , prior to sexual differentiation, with new data from e <dig> gonads. by comparing these two time-points, a detailed view of the gonad transcriptome during sexual differentiation has been revealed.

while the expression of several known or putative gonad sex determinants has previously been assessed in embryonic chicken gonads , this has often been based on assessment of suspected genes and pathways, employing whole mount in situ, qrt-pcr, or protein expression. these screens have been successful in identifying candidates, some of which are also found here .  <cit> . in addition, some of these studies have identified transcriptional differences between the left and right ovary, the latter of which regresses in chicken  <cit> . we did not separate left and right ovary in this study. nevertheless, these approaches are biased towards known pathways inferred from other vertebrates. they lack both the sensitivity and detail of rna-seq. indeed, rna-seq can reveal early changes in gene expression undetectable by other methods.

firstly, the rna-seq data has provided information on the expression of known or putative sex genes. these results are interesting when considering the inferred molecular hierarchy of genes and their signalling in the gonads, both in chicken and other species. for example, in females foxl <dig> shows sexual dimorphism from e <dig> , preceding that of aromatase, which does not become significantly de until e <dig>  this is consistent with previous studies that have suggested that foxl <dig> acts upstream of other female genes, at least at the transcriptional level  <cit> . indeed, in other species ranging from fishes to mammals, foxl <dig> is a putative or known activator of aromatase gene expression  <cit> . given that aromatase expression and oestrogen synthesis is essential for ovary formation in birds, foxl <dig> likely occupies a key position in the female pathway. in addition, a recent study has suggested that the main role of foxl <dig> is as a repressor of male genes  <cit> , and this may explain the importance of early foxl <dig> expression where it would drive the gonadal primordium towards an ovarian fate by repressing male genes and activating female genes.

in the avian embryo, and indeed other vertebrates, the activator of foxl <dig> has not been clearly defined, and while a w-chromosome linked gene may fulfil this role in the chicken, no convincing candidate exists. alternatively, foxl <dig> may be activated by a factor common to both sexes that is antagonized by elevated expression of z-linked dmrt <dig>  dmrt <dig> can antagonise foxl <dig> expression, as evidenced in dmrt <dig> knockdown gonads, which exhibit elevated foxl <dig> transcription and feminization  <cit> . both z-linked dmrt <dig> and hemogen show significant male-bias at e <dig> , as does amh, preceding sox <dig>  which becomes male up-regulated at e <dig>  this indicates that dmrt1/hemogen activate sox <dig> transcription, which is supported by recent over-expression studies in ovo  <cit> .

as the gonads enter the phase of sexual differentiation, they up-regulate sexually dimorphic gene expression, most of which is autosomal. given that some known sex determining genes are dimorphic prior to this activation , these activated genes at e <dig>  are likely downstream regulators of ovarian versus testis development. gene ontology and kegg pathway analysis suggests that many of these genes are involved in the restructuring of the gonad into the morphologically distinct testis or ovary. there was an over-representation of genes involved in ecm and cytoskeleton formation and regulation in the datasets. indeed, a study that used network approaches to analyse sex-biased gene expression in chickens suggested that genes of the same sex bias tended to be more connected to each other than expected, and that when genes were grouped into sex-biased modules these showed functional homogeneity  <cit> .

our rna-seq was carried out on whole chicken gonads and therefore encompasses expression from both supporting cell types  as well as from interstitial cells and from germ cells. to assess the relative importance of each cell type and the potential overlap with mouse gonadal expression profiles we compared our screen and three high throughput microarray screens carried out on embryonic mouse gonads/cells at a similar stage of differentiation . we found significant enrichment  between the genes identified in each study and our own. in addition, these analyses indicate that we have found de genes from not just supporting cell types, but also from the germ cell and stromal/interstitial cell pools, albeit to a lesser extent. interestingly, we found only  <dig> genes were common between the three mouse studies . this probably reflects the subtle differences between each of these screens such as the transgenic mice used, the sorting methods, the microarray platforms and the analyses. interestingly though, of these  <dig> genes  <dig> were also de in our data set. the presence of several already characterised gonadal genes in this list means that these represent excellent candidates for further investigation.

the rna-seq analysis also provided novel candidate genes for sexual differentiation in female and male chicken embryos. by comparing expression in females and males at e <dig> numerous significantly sexually dimorphic genes not previously implicated in gonad development were identified. to validate these lists, several male and female biased genes of interest were chosen, based on their gene ontology and expression. these were validated in vivo using wish to assess their expression in the ugs and in sex reversed gonads. for all genes assayed, expression profiles in wish mimicked those in the rna-seq data, which we have also found previously with w genes  <cit> . for male-biased genes, expression was present in the testis cords, and was up-regulated when female gonads were experimentally sex-reversed using the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole. the female genes assayed were either present in the medulla  or the cortex  of the developing ovary. in the presence of fadrozole, these female-biased genes had reduced expression, which was similar to the level observed in zz males. these results suggest that rna-seq has successfully identified candidate genes for gonadal sexual differentiation in the avian system.

only a small number of genes implicated in ovarian development have been described. many of these have derived from analysis of human or animal disorders of sex development, i.e. wnt <dig>  <cit> , r-spondin <dig>  <cit> , foxl <dig>  <cit>  reviewed in  <cit> . there are still gaps in our understanding of both the initial triggers and the downstream modulators of ovarian development. this study has identified numerous female-biased genes, which may play a role in ovarian differentiation. indeed, we focused our studies on three of these genes, using specific antibodies against the chicken proteins. protein expression was similar to that revealed by the rna-seq and wish analyses. closer investigation into expression provided insight into the potential role of these genes.

one candidate gene was fgfr <dig>  an fgf receptor. fgf <dig> plays a key role in testis differentiation, and in the regulation of germ cell development . several fgf receptors exist in vertebrate species. loss of fgfr <dig> in mice testis leads to partial sex reversal  <cit> , but intriguingly both fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> show significant female-biased expression in our e <dig> data. fgfr <dig> has been shown to interact with fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  <cit>  and is thought to be important in the post-natal testis  <cit> . a role for fgfr <dig> has not yet been described in the ovary during embryogenesis. interestingly, fgf <dig> itself was very weakly expressed in e <dig> gonads, and was not sex-biased, and so the role of this fgf may not be conserved outside mammals. . furthermore, we did not identify any fgf ligand showing male-biased expression at e <dig>  in contrast, fgf <dig> showed robust female-biased expression. this fgf is also female-biased in nile tilapia gonads  <cit> , and may play a role in early oocyte development. it is interesting to speculate that fgf <dig> signalling though fgfr2/ <dig> in the female may contribute to ovary differentiation or female germ cell maturation in chickens.

capn <dig> was expressed in the adrenal glands of both sexes, and the gonads of the female only, where it was found in a subset of cells present in the juxta-cortical medulla. the 3βhsd enzyme, which is involved in the synthesis of sex steroids testosterone and oestrogen is also expressed in a similar subset of cells as well as the adrenal glands . this indicates that different cell lineages exist in the medulla and it appears that capn <dig> is expressed in a subset of these. these data suggest that this novel candidate may be involved in the differentiation or function of steroid producing cells in the ovary as well as in the adrenal glands of both sexes.

in contrast, our third ovarian candidate, gpr <dig>  was expressed in cortex of the differentiating ovary as it proliferates during ovarian development. wnt <dig> and rspo <dig> are expressed in the cortex of the developing ovary, and their activated transcription factor β-catenin appears to be stabilized there  <cit> . recently, another g-protein coupled receptor, lgr <dig> has been shown to be expressed in cortical granulosa precursor cells, and plays a role in germ cell differentiation and survival  <cit> . indeed, lgr <dig> binds r-spondin proteins and enhances rspo/wnt/β-catenin signalling . it will be interesting to determine if gpr <dig> also interacts with this pathway in the cortex of the chicken ovary.

these genes are all interesting candidates for ovarian development and functional studies including overexpression and knockdown are now underway in our laboratory to establish their exact roles. most recently, we have developed the method of in ovo electroporation to deliver genes or antisense rnas directly into developing gonads  <cit> . this methodology is being used to manipulate the novel candidate genes identified in the current study.

several caveats to this type of analysis that focuses on sexually dimorphic genes is that not all key genes involved in ovarian versus testicular development will be expressed in a sex-biased fashion. some genes may be expressed in both sexes but only have a key role on one sex. in mouse embryos, gadd45g and map3k <dig> are expressed in the early gonad equally in both sexes, yet mutations in these genes lead only to sex reversal in xy males  because they act on the sry gene  through the p <dig> mapk pathway. typically these genes have been identified in human dsd cases or mouse mutants. in addition, this analysis was based on genes correctly annotated in the galgal <dig> chicken genome, thus missing genes that are unannotated or lie in regions that have typically been difficult to sequence. de novo transcript assembly of the mrnas expressed at e <dig> may reveal additional novel candidates for sex determination.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first rna-seq analysis of embryonic gonads at the time of sexual differentiation. these data have provided a detailed view of the transcriptional changes that occur when sexual differentiation begins. over  <dig> genes were significantly sexually de at this stage, most of which are autosomal genes. many of these likely contribute to the morphological changes taking place, such as ecm remodelling and tubulogenesis. these data provide several new candidate ovary or testis differentiation genes, some of which we have validated in vivo. in particular, we show that capn <dig> and gpr <dig> are excellent candidates for ovarian development. functional studies on these novel candidates are now underway in our laboratory, with a view to clarifying their roles in gonadal development and differentiation.
