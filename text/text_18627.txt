BACKGROUND
in the early vertebrate embryo, both hematopoietic and endothelial lineages derive from aggregates of mesodermal cells that form the blood islands in the extraembryonic yolk sac  <cit> . this observation led to the hypothesis that both lineages derive from a common precursor named the hemangioblast  <cit> . although still debatable, the existence of hemangioblasts is mainly supported by in vitro differentiation studies  <cit>  as well as by evidence that blood and endothelial progenitors express a number of genes in common, such as vegfr <dig>  gata <dig>  lmo <dig> and scl/tal <dig>  <cit> , some of which regulate the differentiation of both cell lineages  <cit> . other than these in vitro and genetic studies, further insight into hemangioblast cell fate will require time-lapse imaging studies using a lineage-specific marker.

hemangioblast reporters have been described in transgenic mouse and zebrafish models  <cit> . however, a particularly suitable system for visualizing live hematovascular development is the yolk sac of the avian embryo  <cit> . during the study of chick cerberus  transcriptional regulation  <cit> , we isolated a cis-regulatory region that drives reporter gene expression specifically in blood-island progenitors or hemangioblasts. here, we report the identification and characterization of this novel hemangioblast-specific enhancer and reveal its potential as a live imaging tool for studying blood and vascular development.

RESULTS
to study the transcriptional activity of ccer cis-regulatory region, chick embryos were electroporated with reporter constructs containing ccer 5' genomic sequences of different lengths upstream of the coding sequence for enhanced green fluorescent protein , and observed under a fluorescent microscope   <cit> . our initial results showed that a 400-base pairs  promoter fragment upstream from the atg of ccer  is able to drive egfp expression in cell populations that express ccer, i.e., the anterior mesendoderm  and the left-side mesoderm  <cit> . further deletion analysis revealed an ectopic domain of expression in the posterior extraembryonic mesoderm where hemangioblasts are located  <cit> . this pattern was observed in embryos electroporated with constructs that lack the - <dig> to - <dig> bp sequence , suggesting that this region may contain a silencer of hemangioblast expression. cer-egfp expression was abolished in the anterior mesendoderm and restricted to hemangioblasts in embryos electroporated with constructs that lack the - <dig> to - <dig> bp sequence . pcr <dig> regulatory sequence is hereafter named the hemangioblast or hb enhancer, and the hemangioblast-specific reporters pcr2-egfp and pcr8-egfp are named hb-egfp.

sequence analysis of the hb enhancer identified binding sites for transcription factors implicated in endothelial and blood cell differentiation, namely ets, gata and foxh <dig>  <cit>  . to determine which of these binding elements may be responsible for the regulation of hemangioblast-specific expression, we analyzed the expression of reporter constructs containing mutations in the ets , gata  or foxh <dig>  sites in the pcr <dig> sequence  <cit>  . hemangioblast expression was unaltered in embryos electroporated with the emut, g1mut and fmut constructs, but abolished in those electroporated with the g2mut construct . these observations demonstrate that the g <dig> site is essential for the induction or maintenance of transcription in hemangioblasts, and suggest that the gata <dig> is a transcriptional activator of the hb enhancer in blood-island progenitors  <cit> .

in the avian embryo, hemangioblasts ingress through the posterior primitive streak between stages hh <dig> and hh <dig>  <cit> . to characterize the expression pattern of the hb-egfp reporter, embryos were electroporated at either early or late stages , placed in culture and observed at successive time points . in embryos electroporated at hh3- <dig>  hb-egfp fluorescence was initially detected in posterior primitive streak cells  and in a cvegfr2-positive population of posterior extraembryonic cells . at later stages, egfp-positive cells migrate away from the embryo and form aggregates in the extraembryonic region  that will give rise to the blood islands . at hh <dig>  hb-egfp fluorescence was restricted to differentiated blood islands and the vascular cells that connect them . in embryos electroporated at hh5- <dig>  hb-egfp expression was specifically detected in the blood islands that form closer to the embryo . taken together, these observations suggest that the hb enhancer is continually activated in ingressing hemangioblasts that populate the extraembryonic region in a lateral to medial temporal progression  <cit> .

to confirm the specificity of the hb-egfp reporter, we analyzed the gene expression profile of early hb-egfp-positive cells and investigated the co-localization of egfp fluorescence with known markers of hemangioblast-derived cells. as expected, genes expressed in hemangioblasts, such as lmo <dig> , tal <dig>  and cd <dig> , are enriched in the hb-egfp-positive population, whereas those expressed in other cell types, such as the endoderm , neuroectoderm  and paraxial mesoderm , are downregulated . at a later stage , hb-egfp fluorescence is detected both in endothelial cells, which express cvegfr <dig> protein , and in blood cells, which express the rbc antigen . however, hb-egfp expression is not observed in the sma-positive smooth muscle cells that surround the blood islands . this observation supports the hypothesis that smooth muscle cells are not derived from hemangioblasts  <cit> .

taken together, our observations indicate that hb-egfp expression is initiated in hemangioblasts as they emerge from the primitive streak and is detected in differentiated endothelial and blood cells at least until hh <dig> . this pattern was confirmed by time-lapse imaging of live electroporated embryos. at low amplification, we could see the egfp-fluorescent cells moving away from the posterior primitive streak, aggregating to form the blood islands, and giving rise to the vascular plexus by connecting the separate islands . at higher magnification, we were able to follow the movements of individual endothelial and blood cells , such as the interchange of cells between different blood islands and the cell division of an erythroblast. moreover, in older embryos, the hb-egfp reporter proved to be a very useful tool to record blood cell flow in the vascular plexus of the yolk sac .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we identified a hemangioblast enhancer located in ccer cis-regulatory region and describe its activity in developing chick embryos. furthermore, we have used the hb-egfp reporter to characterize the gene expression profile of hemangioblasts and visualize blood island morphogenesis and differentiation in living embryos. in the future, the hb-egfp reporter may become a valuable genetic tool for targeting ectopic gene expression to the hemangioblast population as well as for studying live vasculogenesis and blood flow.
