BACKGROUND
in eukaryotes sexual reproduction is an almost universal trend  <cit> , a fact that underlines its importance both for individual fitness and long-term survival of species  <cit> . fungi in particular have evolved a rich repertoire of mating strategies and sex-determining systems that has no parallel in other eukaryotic lineages  <cit> . sexual identity in fungi is always established in the haploid stage  <cit>  and determined by specialized genomic regions called mating type  loci  <cit> . in general, fungal mat loci encode transcription factors that regulate the expression of determinants of sexual identity/compatibility, such as peptide pheromones and pheromone receptors belonging to the g protein-coupled receptor family  <cit> .

in ascomycota, and possibly also in mucoromycotina and chytridiomycota, the mat loci occur in two alternate forms that determine two mating types or sexual compatibility groups  <cit> . this constitutes the so-called bipolar mating system. however, in basidiomycota, two functional classes of genes can be found within mat loci: in addition to transcriptional regulators , the genes encoding pheromones and pheromone receptors  are also located in the genomic regions that determine sexual identity. this formed the basis for the existence of a more complex mating system in some basidiomycetes. in this system two classes of mat genes  are located in two genetically unlinked mat loci   <cit> . this system is called tetrapolar, because four different mating types are generated after meiosis. irrespective of whether the mating system is bipolar or tetrapolar, mating identity and compatibility are generally determined in basidiomycetes at two levels. first, mating and cell fusion occurs when individuals carry different alleles of genes encoding small lipopeptide pheromones and pr  <cit> . following fusion of compatible partners, progression through the sexual cycle depends on a second compatibility checkpoint that relies on the formation of a heterodimeric homeodomain transcription factor  encoded also at the mat locus  <cit> . the homeodomain transcription factor is only active after cell fusion because dimerization is restricted to hd <dig> and hd <dig> subunits that originate from genetically different individuals  <cit> . one additional relevant aspect of the tetrapolar system is that mat loci are often highly polymorphic bringing forth species with many allelic forms that can produce up to thousands of mating types  <cit> . remarkably, in basidiomycetes with many mating types , the control of cell-cell attraction and fusion by p/pr signalling has been abandoned  <cit>  but it is still essential for the development and maintenance of the dikaryotic state. in addition, a third mat system, designated pseudo-bipolar, was recently found in members of the red yeast genera rhodosporidium and sporidiobolus, that belong to an early diverged lineage of basidiomycetes  <cit> . in both bipolar and pseudo-bipolar systems only two mating types are found but in the latter some characteristics of tetrapolar systems are also present, like the occasional occurrence of recombination within the bipolar mat locus  <cit> . among the diversity of mating systems found in fungi, various types of self-fertility  have also evolved  <cit> . in those cases, heterothallism , is replaced by the ability of a single clone to form sexual structures and reproduce sexually.

in addition to the various modes of sexual reproduction, asexual reproduction is also a conspicuous process of fungal propagation. this suggests that for fungi the advantages of sex, namely the promotion of adaptive evolution and the more efficient elimination of deleterious mutations  <cit> , may in many instances be insufficient to counterbalance its disadvantages, normally associated with energy and time costs of sexuality  <cit> . the reasons why sexuality can be facultative in fungi seem to be related to the availability of mitotically formed spores and other modes of asexual propagation  <cit> . however, although the ability to reproduce mitotically in fast and efficient ways acts potentially as a strong evolutionary promoter of asexuality  <cit> , available evidence indicates that asexuality is a derived character. firstly, asexual species are clearly a minority . secondly, asexual species very often have phylogenetically close relatives capable of sexual reproduction  <cit> .

in this study we focused our attention on a basal lineage of basidiomycetes that is notorious for the co-existence of sexual and asexual species, the red yeasts of the order sporidiobolales. this order is classified in the subphylum pucciniomycotina, the earliest diverged lineage of basidiomycetes  <cit> , whose most notable members are the rust fungi. a classical and presently much debated rule in fungal nomenclature imposes that asexual and sexual fungi are classified separately, in different species and genera  <cit> . for example, in the order sporidiobolales sexual species are classified in the genera rhodosporidium and sporidiobolus whereas asexual forms are classified in rhodotorula and sporobolomyces  <cit> . therefore, the co-existence in the same phylogenetic group of very closely related species of sexual and asexual taxa with similar ecological and physiological properties raises several questions:  are asexual species truly asexual having thus no traces of mat genes in their genomes?  alternatively, have asexual species formed recently and therefore still exhibit  sex related genes?  is mating type imbalance possibly giving rise to asexual lineages?  is asexuality contributing to speciation by giving rise to new species that derive from extant sexual stocks? these questions were addressed in this study by surveying the presence and integrity of mat genes in an expanded set of red yeast species. in order to get some additional insight in the evolution of mat loci in the sporidiobolales, we also compared gene content and organization around mat genes between opposite mating types and across different species.

RESULTS
updated phylogeny of the sporidiobolales
we investigated a group of  <dig> red yeast species representing the phylogenetic diversity in the order sporidiobolales. these species are classified in four genera, two sexual - rhodosporidium and sporidiobolus - and two asexual - rhodotorula and sporobolomyces. an updated molecular phylogeny of the sporidiobolales based on the concatenated alignment of the complete its region  and the d1/d <dig> domain of the lsu rrna is shown in figure  <dig>  three statistically well-supported clades were observed. although such organization was somewhat anticipated in previous studies , the incorporation of more taxa, including species not yet formally described, and the combination of its and d1/d <dig> data, improved the resolution of the present analysis. whereas clade a included only species of rhodosporidium and rhodotorula, which are characterized by the absence of forcibly discharged spores , clade c contained only species of sporidiobolus and sporobolomyces that are able to form ballistoconidia. at variance with clades a and c, clade b included representatives of the four genera, which indicates that the traditional classification separating genera based on the ability to form ballistoconidia is not supported at the molecular level. it is also evident from figure  <dig> that in all three clades, sexual and asexual species are completely intermingled.

pheromone receptor genes as molecular markers of mating type identity
multiple hd1/hd <dig> alleles were found in red yeast species, and phylogenetic analyses suggested that allele diversification occurred only after each species was formed  <cit> . in addition, hd1/hd <dig> genes of different red yeast species were found to be highly divergent precluding their utilization for mating type screening purposes over a wide phylogenetic range. on the contrary, phylogenetic analyses of the pr alleles  of both m. violaceum and s. salmonicolor, revealed ancient trans-specific polymorphisms  <cit>  as expected for genes maintained under long-term balancing selection  <cit> . since only two pr alleles were present in each species examined so far, and the presence of each allele correlated in all cases with mating behaviour  <cit> , pr genes can be advantageously used as markers for mating type at the molecular level across a broad range of red yeast species.

all heterothallic red yeast species within the order sporidiobolales were originally described as having a bipolar mating behaviour. such studies involved only standard crossing tests and strains were therefore arbitrarily assigned to either mat a <dig> or mat a <dig> within each species. pr genes were first identified in r. toruloides and were named ste <dig> a <dig> and ste <dig> a <dig> in accordance with the mating type of the strains in which they were initially characterized  <cit> . after the identification of the sequences of the pr genes in s. salmonicolor and s. johnsonii, it became clear that as a result of the original arbitrary assignment of mating types, each ste <dig> allele was associated with strains of the opposite mating type, . to avoid future confusion, we previously renamed the mating type designations of these two species to match the molecular data  <cit> . here we investigated at the molecular level the current mating type designations of the heterothallic species included in this work. to that end we employed a pcr-based approach with degenerate primers that specifically amplified ste <dig> a <dig> or ste <dig> a <dig> alleles. in approximately half of the heterothallic species analysed  the incongruences previously observed for s. salmonicolor were also detected, and in these cases the mating type designations were altered so as to match the molecular identity of the strains . it should be noted that in r. sphaerocarpum and s. ruineniae only the ste <dig> a <dig> allele could be identified . nevertheless, the fact that the ste <dig> a <dig> allele was only found in strains that mated as mat a <dig> suggested that the ste <dig> a <dig> allele is most probably present in mat a <dig> strains, but the set of primers that we used failed to amplify it. for r. babjevae we investigated  <dig> strains . previously, mating studies had identified five strains as mat a <dig>  four strains as mat a <dig> and two strains as self-fertile. the remaining  <dig> strains were found to be sexually impaired and thus considered asexual. the molecular characterization of pr alleles confirmed for the sexual strains the results obtained with standard crossing tests. it also showed that one of the self-fertile strains  contained both receptor alleles and that  <dig> asexual strains belonged to mat a <dig> and three to mat a <dig>  both mating types were present in strains isolated in russia , argentina  and japan . however, the six strains isolated in portugal belonged solely to mat a <dig>  using tester strains with good mating abilities and five asexual strains for which the molecular determination of mating type had been obtained, we repeated crosses and confirmed that these strains do not mate in culture.

pheromone receptor genes in asexual species
we subsequently investigated the presence of pr homologues  in  <dig> asexual species classified in the genera rhodotorula and sporobolomyces . amplification of ste <dig> a <dig> and/or ste <dig> a <dig> alleles was successful in  <dig> species among the  <dig> examined . when multiple strains were available for a species, both pr alleles were normally detected, signalling the presence of the two mating types in natural populations of these presumably asexual species. however, an interesting exception was found for the sibling species rh. glutinis and rh. graminis. whereas all six strains of rh. glutinis possessed the ste <dig> a <dig> allele, all four strains of rh. graminis exhibited the ste <dig> a <dig> allele . these two species are also closely related to the heterothallic species r. babjevae. in contrast to r. babjevae, only a limited number of strains of rh. graminis and rh. glutinis have been isolated worldwide  <cit> , all of which were included in the present study. for these three species, inter-species mating has been tested, but was not observed  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that asexuality in rh. graminis and rh. glutinis might be related to a strong but relatively recent mating type imbalance. nevertheless, a larger sampling of both species would be required to accurately determine the mating type distribution and frequency and to elucidate if sex occurs in nature by looking for footprints of recombination, as done previously for other asexual fungi  <cit> . moreover, it is important to note that mating type imbalance does not lead necessarily to asexuality as demonstrated in c. neoformans  <cit> .

next, we investigated the integrity of pr genes in asexual species. to this end, the complete genes were sequenced. we found that none of them showed hallmarks of degradation and that a protein sequence could be readily obtained by conceptual translation in all cases, suggesting that these genes encode functional proteins. we also inspected the pr genes in the recently released genomes of the presumptively asexual species sporobolomyces sp. iam  <dig>  and rh. graminis wp <dig>  , available at the joint genome institute . again, intact and complete sequences of the pr genes were identified. therefore, our results suggest that asexuality in red yeasts is not ancient, which is consistent with other studies that have shown that in presumed asexual ascomycetes, mating type genes are present and apparently functional  <cit> . it is also possible that some supposedly asexual species have retained a cryptic sexual stage that is difficult to induce in the laboratory.

in contrast to these observations, for five asexual species  no pr alleles were found . with the exception of "rh. pinicorticis" and sp. odoratus, the remaining species are closely related to each other and belong to a lineage of clade a that includes also r. sphaerocarpum and rh. dairenensis. the phylogenetic analysis of ste <dig> a <dig> from r. sphaerocarpum and ste <dig> a <dig> from rh. dairenensis, suggested that the amino acid sequences of these pr genes are unusually divergent . therefore, it is conceivable that the lack of amplification in the remaining species is due to more divergent but still functional sequences. a similar explanation might apply for the amplification of r. sphaerocarpum ste <dig> a <dig> in only one out of six mat a <dig> strains investigated.

for rh. araucariae pycc  <dig> two pr alleles  were detected . however, the nucleotide sequence of the ste <dig> a <dig> allele in this strain differed from homologous sequences of conspecific strains of the same mating type . surprisingly, the ste <dig> a <dig> allele of rh. araucariae pycc  <dig> was found to be 100% identical to the ste <dig> a <dig> gene of "rh. hamamotoiana" pycc  <dig>  contrary to the other strains of rh. araucariae, cells of strain pycc  <dig> formed a slender projection that resembled a conjugation tube, although actual conjugation between cells of the same strain or with cells of the other strains of rh. araucariae was not observed. it seems plausible that the phenotype of pycc  <dig> is due to the presence of mat alleles of both mating types , as a result of a past hybridization event between the two species. however, incompatibilities at other loci, like for example the hd locus, are perhaps impairing progression through the sexual cycle, as no dikaryotic mycelium or teliospores were observed.

pheromone receptor genes in self-fertile species
in homothallic species, a single strain can complete the life cycle without the need for a complementary mating partner. although several mechanisms of homothallism have been put forward in fungi  <cit> , the most common explanation for this sexual behaviour is that these species have both mat alleles in a single genome and can therefore form sexual structures alone. in this study we searched for the presence of both pr alleles in three species from clade b that contain only self-fertile strains - r. fluviale, r. lusitaniae and s. microsporus - but only ste <dig> a <dig> alleles were found. although we could not rule out that the absence of amplification of ste <dig> a <dig> alleles was due to mutations in primer target sequences, we deem this explanation less likely in this case, since ste <dig> a <dig> alleles were identified and sequenced in closely related species of clade b, like r. azoricum and rh. colostri. we hypothesize that for these three species self-fertility could be due to compatibility at the hd locus despite homozygosity at the pr locus. if confirmed, such a situation would parallel that found in the corn smut pathogen ustilago maydis, in which diploid strains that are homozygous at the pr locus but heterozygous at the hd locus are able to produce teliospores that germinate and undergo meiosis in a way that is indistinguishable from that of the heterozygous diploids at both mat loci  <cit> . a similar self-fertile phenotype is originated in c. neoformans when either the α sex inducer gene sxi1α  is introduced into a cells or the a sex inducer gene sxi2a  is introduced into α cells  <cit> . nevertheless, whereas the diploid strains of u. maydis only produce incipient hyphae because maintenance of filamentous growth also requires heterozygosity at the pr locus  <cit> , for the self-fertile yeast species studied we found extensive hyphal growth. therefore, this also raises the possibility that in self-fertile red yeast species, the pr locus may be self-compatible either by constitutive activation of the pheromone receptor or by an autocrine signalling loop to produce a permanent signalling pathway. interestingly, examples of mutations supporting both hypotheses have been reported in laboratory  <cit> . some heterothallic species of red yeasts also include a few self-fertile strains . in most of those cases we found that both pr alleles were present  suggesting that self-fertility in red yeasts can be attained by different molecular mechanisms.

phylogenies of pheromone receptors
using partial sequences of ste <dig> a <dig> and ste <dig> a <dig> alleles we compared the evolutionary history of the two pr whose trans-specific phylogenies indicate that their divergence dates back to the origin of sexuality in basidiomycetes  <cit> . phylogenies based on the protein sequences of the pr genes were constructed separately for each receptor  in order to maximize the quality of the alignments . in spite of general concordance between rdna and pr trees, three conflicts were detected in the ste <dig> a <dig> tree. these cases correspond to the placement of r. diobovatum, r. paludigenum and r. sphaerocarpum outside their respective groups, by comparison with rdna and ste <dig> a <dig> trees . however, it should be noted that bootstrap values in the ste <dig> a <dig> tree tended to be lower than those obtained for the ste <dig> a <dig> tree and that therefore these conflicts might be due to poor resolution in the ste <dig> a <dig> tree.

structure of the mat a <dig> and mat a <dig> genomic regions encompassing the alternate pheromone receptors
we have previously observed in a restricted number of red yeast species that genomic regions around the pr locus exhibited synteny breaks, gene inversions and sequence divergence between the two mating types as a result of apparent partial suppression of recombination, while synteny was well conserved across species when mat regions of the same mating type where compared  <cit> . here we set out to assess whether these observations also held true for the expanded set of red yeast species presently under scrutiny. taking advantage of whole-genome data of sporobolomyces sp. iam  <dig>  and rh. graminis wp <dig> , we assessed the synteny around the pr genes in red yeast species belonging to clades a, b and c . pcr primers anchored on the 3' end region of the genes flanking the ste <dig> a <dig>  and ste <dig> a <dig>  yielded almost always an amplification product between  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb, consistent with a gene organization identical to that found in the genomes of sporobolomyces sp. iam  <dig> and rh. graminis wp <dig> . sequencing of the complete intervening regions confirmed the suspected synteny within the same mating type across the majority of the species . however, for some species, like mat a <dig> strains of r. paludigenum, gene order seemed to have been disrupted since no amplification products were obtained even when using different combinations of primers for the more conserved flanking genes. another interesting exception was s. ruineniae cbs  <dig>  where a mat a <dig> pheromone precursor homologue similar to the rha <dig> a <dig> of r. toruloides  <cit>  was found between ribl18ae and ribl <dig> instead of the ste <dig> a <dig> gene usually present at this location . this indicates that the ste <dig> a <dig> gene has been relocated to a different and presently unknown genomic location in this species.

we next examined a larger genomic region of the mat a <dig> and mat a <dig> loci. to do so,  <dig> kb regions encompassing the ste <dig> a <dig> gene in sporobolomyces sp. iam  <dig> and the ste <dig> a <dig> gene in rh. graminis wp <dig> were compared . in rh. graminis wp <dig> we identified two identical putative pheromone precursor homologues , similar but not syntenic to the rha <dig> a <dig> gene of r. toruloides mat a <dig> strains   <cit> . the regions upstream of rgrha <dig> a <dig> and rgrha <dig> a <dig> were identical. a shorter sequence of approximately  <dig> bp was also identical and was detected downstream of rnapol in an inverted orientation . this suggests that an additional copy of the pheromone precursor gene may have existed at this genomic location similarly to that found in mat a <dig>  notably, mat a <dig> pheromone genes in s. salmonicolor and r. toruloides were found to be embedded in conserved inverted repeats  <cit> , a situation earlier documented in the basidiomycete human pathogen c. neoformans  <cit> . these repeats are likely maintained by intra-allelic gene conversion to ensure maintenance of gene function in face of the absence of meiotic recombination characteristic of these regions  <cit> .

our comparison of the gene content of the mat genomic regions shows that gene content is similar despite the phylogenetic distance between sporobolomyces sp. and rh. graminis  and that apparently functional copies of each allele have been retained in both mat loci. this is in contrast to genes encoded in sex chromosomes of diploid organisms, for which degeneration and loss of one functional copy frequently occurs  <cit> . maintenance of both alleles in fungal sex-determining regions, including the mat loci of red yeasts, is most probably related to the fact that fungi commonly occur as haploids in the environment, and thus gene degeneration or loss is very likely to be detrimental. however, gene order seems to have been deeply altered during mating type divergence and many gene blocks were found in inverted positions, probably restraining recombination between opposite mat regions . on the contrary, within the same mating type, the analysed regions were found to be highly syntenic even between more distantly related species .

diversity and evolution of homeodomain transcription factors
we have previously observed that the hd1/hd <dig> alleles of some red yeasts are much more divergent than the correspondent pr genes  <cit> , and therefore less suitable for comparisons involving more distantly related species. nevertheless, we aimed to ascertain if the genes encoding these transcriptional regulatory factors appear to be functional within a more expanded group of red yeasts including sexual and asexual strains and species and to evaluate their pattern of evolution. to this end, partial sequences of hd1/hd <dig> alleles were obtained for six species and their phylogeny is shown in figure  <dig>  in clade a, formed by s. johnsonii and s. salmonicolor, the topology of the hd1/hd <dig> tree conflicts with the rdna  and ste <dig>  trees because s. johnsonii cbs  <dig> harbours an hd1/hd <dig> s. salmonicolor-type allele and the converse situation occurs for s. salmonicolor strains cbs  <dig>  cbs  <dig> and ihmt 2446/ <dig> . such discrepancies suggest that the two species are not fully genetically isolated and that mating with exchange of hd1/hd <dig> alleles is still possible. in clade b, the lack of strict species-specificity of hd1/hd <dig> alleles is also evident for the complex r. babjevae - rh. glutinis - rh. graminis. our observation that pheromone precursor genes seem to encode very similar or even identical peptides in closely related species, possibly precluding discrimination between species prior to cell fusion is also in line with this. for example, only synonymous substitutions were detected when analyzing the rha <dig> a <dig> genes encoding the tandem pheromone peptides from different strains of s. salmonicolor and s. johnsonii . this results in the production of identical peptide pheromones, a circumstance that is likely to facilitate interspecies mating.

judging from available data, a geographic structure for hd1/hd <dig> allele distribution seems to be lacking since strains of rh. glutinis from different regions have the same hd1/hd <dig> alleles and in rh. graminis different alleles were recovered from the same region . for most of the species studied each strain had a unique hd1/hd <dig> allele although in rh. glutinis four strains shared the same hd1/hd <dig> allele. for two strains of r. babjevae  it seems that a recent recombination event between the two mat regions gave rise to strains with different pr alleles that share the same hd1/hd <dig> allele, consistent with the proposed pseudo-bipolar system  <cit>  . although the phylogenies and diversity of hd1/hd <dig> alleles in s. salmonicolor and s. johnsonii suggested that such events were likely to occur albeit at low frequency, they had been thus far detected only in laboratory crosses  <cit> .

allele divergence as inferred by branch length seems to be lower for the species in clade a, solely composed of sexually competent strains, than in clade b, which is dominated by asexual strains . adaptive changes in protein-coding genes may be detected by comparing the number of synonymous  and nonsynonymous  substitutions per site, with the ratio ω = dn/ds providing a measure of selection at the protein level. we used seven codon-site models of variable ratios of ω across site, as implemented in paml version  <dig>   <cit> , to investigate the evolutionary constraints acting on the n-terminal domain of hd <dig> alleles, which is known to define mating specificity, as well as the initial part of the homeodomain motif. this analysis was done separately for each clade, and for clade b it involved sexual and asexual species and sexual and asexual strains within a species , whereas clade a was composed solely of sexual strains . detailed descriptions of the models, likelihood ratio statistics and parameter estimates for each dataset are given in additional file  <dig>  r. diobovatum was excluded because it was too divergent from the remaining species in clade b, presenting ds >  <dig>  in most pairwise comparisons. we found that the hd <dig> gene evolves faster in clade a than in clade b given the averaged values of ω for the two clades  obtained from model m <dig> , which assumes a single ω for all codons in the sequence. however, synonymous substitution rates were significantly higher in clade b than in clade a , indicating that in clade b, the hd <dig> gene may be under fewer functional constraints, possibly due to a lower strength of codon usage bias associated with changes in the level of gene expression  <cit> . for the dataset of clade a, models m2a  and m <dig> , which allow for positive selection at a subset of sites, fitted the data better than the null models m1a , m <dig>  and m8a , which do not allow for positive selection . parameter estimates under model m <dig>  for the dataset of clade a suggest that ~ 22% of the sites are under diversifying selection  with ωs =  <dig> . these sites were found within the regions determining mat specificity, in accordance with previous observations  <cit> . nevertheless, the average ω along the n-terminal region was <  <dig>  as also observed in other systems such as the s-loci of plants  <cit> . additionally, sites within the homeodomain motif exhibited low ω  indicative of strong purifying selection. the posterior probabilities obtained under model m <dig> for the different site classes  are shown in figure  <dig>  for the clade b dataset , positive selection models did not fit the data better than the models implying neutral evolution indicating that positive selection is not driving the evolution of the hd <dig> gene in this clade . moreover, model m8a  where an extra site class was constrained to have ω =  <dig>  seems to fit the data better than other models  consistent with the identification of relaxed purifying selection  <cit> . this may be a consequence of loss of sexual competence in rh. glutinis, rh. graminis, and in several strains of r. babjevae. in line with this, stop codons were found in n-terminal regions of the hd <dig> gene of rh. graminis cbs  <dig> and r. babjevae cbs  <dig>  which is asexual. in rh. glutinis cbs  <dig> a dinucleotide repeat  <dig> insertion followed by a premature stop codon most likely renders this gene non-functional. although c-terminal truncations of other hd proteins, including sxi1α in c. neoformans  <cit> , did not affect their functionality, the early stop codons found in asexual strains of red yeasts are located in the n-terminal region of the protein, thus presumably originating very short  proteins devoid of homeodomain motifs. for the hd <dig> gene, no stop codons were found in the analysed regions and the evolution of the homeodomain motif seems to be dominated by purifying selection in species of both clades. while this may suggest that hd <dig> proteins have additional roles that do not require heterodimerization , another possibility is that this gene is losing its mating specific role in species of clade b as a consequence of relaxed functional constraints. therefore, it seems possible that the sequence divergence of the hd1/hd <dig> genes examined here is governed both by diversifying and by relaxing selection, and that this may be either the cause or the consequence of loss of sexual competence by individual strains.

our results suggest that loss of sex might not occur uniformly across the sporidiobolales. different molecular evolution patterns may be related with distinct selective constraints acting on different species. s. salmonicolor and s. johnsonii exemplify a case of strictly sexual red yeasts whose hd1/hd <dig> alleles exhibit low ds values possibly due to some form of constraint on synonymous substitutions like codon bias  <cit>  , but where allele specific regions are evolving under positive selection. the study of maintenance or loss of sex in red yeast could benefit from a larger population sampling that would allow to look for genetic footprints of recombination  <cit> . nevertheless, even fungi shown to be purely clonal from a population genetic perspective , also present mat genes in their genomes  <cit> , suggesting that sex has been lost only recently.

CONCLUSIONS
we examined  <dig> strains belonging to  <dig> species of the sporidiobolales and found apparently functional pr homologues for most strains, irrespective of their sexual or asexual status. in addition, we observed that all asexual species have phylogenetic close relatives that mate well in laboratory conditions and we think it is likely that asexual red yeasts have lost the ability to cross, although this has not  resulted in the degeneration or loss of mat genes in most cases. however, we detected mutations likely driving loss of function in hd <dig> homologues in some asexual strains here investigated, which seems to be consistent with relaxed selection as a consequence of loss of sex.

taken together, our results suggest a fuzzy separation between sexual and asexual red yeast species, illustrated by the existence of asexual strains within sexual species and by the conservation of mat regions in asexual species. the co-existence of sexual and asexual reproduction in red yeasts probably facilitates the emergence of asexual lineages. for example, rh. glutinis and rh. graminis seem to derive from populations of a heterothallic r. babjevae-like ancestor that have independently lost the ability to mate. notably, sexual reproduction in the latter species seems to be lost easily, as many of the r. babjevae strains we investigated were unable to mate.

several authors have argued that most asexual fungi are evolutionary dead ends awaiting extinction  <cit> . this fits well with our observations in red yeasts since we did not find evidence among extant species for ancient events of loss of sexuality. instead, we uncovered abundant substantiation for frequent and recent such events, leading in some cases to the isolation of lineages and eventually to speciation but never to the generation of exclusively asexual phylogenetic lineages that persist for a long time.
