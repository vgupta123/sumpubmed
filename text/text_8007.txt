BACKGROUND
non-small cell lung cancer  is the most common form of lung cancer. it accounts for more than 80% of all lung cancer related deaths
 <cit> . after surgical removal of nsclc, cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the first line of treatment
 <cit> . cisplatin and its derivatives are mutagenic chemicals that can induce dna interstrand or intrastrand cross links through forming dna adducts. tumor cells damaged by these drugs will trigger cell death
 <cit> . however, cisplatin-based chemotherapy also causes highly toxic side effects
 <cit> . recent statistical analysis of clinical data shows that cisplatin-based chemotherapy can only add an approximately 4–15% survival advantage at five years with a subgroup of nsclc patients exhibiting no beneficial effects of drug treatment or even worse outcomes after treatment
 <cit> . thus, it is imperative to use prognostic or predictive biomarkers to identify patients who should receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy
 <cit> .

cisplatin or other dna crosslinkers could cause dna damages on either one or two strands of dna duplex. in cells, multiple dna repair pathways are involved in repairing these damages, including nucleotide excision repair and interstrand crosslink repair pathway
 <cit> . therefore, strong endogenous dna damage repairing capabilities in tumor cells will compromise the therapeutic drug effects of cisplatin
 <cit> . this could be the major biochemical mechanism that explains different patient responses towards cisplatin-based treatments
 <cit> . the ercc1-xpf heterodimeric endonuclease protein complex involves in both nucleotide excision repair and interstrand crosslink repair pathway. xpf acts as the catalytic subunit and ercc <dig> binds dna
 <cit> . quite a number of clinical studies have already shown a good correlation between ercc <dig> mrna level and cisplatin drug resistance
 <cit> . this suggests that examining ercc <dig> expression levels might be a good method to identify patients who are likely to benefit from cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

to evaluate ercc <dig> protein levels in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples, a high quality monoclonal antibody validated for immunohistochemistry is needed. currently there are several anti-ercc <dig> ihc antibodies available on the market
 <cit> . however, the published data for them is highly controversial and none of them is widely accepted as specific for application in ihc. more than  <dig> published clinical studies were conducted using the 8f <dig> clone making it the most commonly used anti-ercc <dig> diagnostic monoclonal antibody currently on the market
 <cit> . recently, its target specificity has been questioned
 <cit> . by using an ercc1-xpf deficient cell line, bhagwat et al. discovered that the 8f <dig> antibody binds to an unknown cross-reactive protein that migrates at a molecular weight similar to ercc <dig> on sds-page gels but the molecular identity for this cross-reactive target was unknown
 <cit> . in this paper, we describe the development and application of a high density protein microarray chip. with this technology, we were not only able to identify the molecular identity of 8f <dig> cross-reactive protein, but also able to use it as a tool to develop two highly specific monoclonal antibodies for ercc <dig> ihc assay.

methods
the high-throughput production of overexpression lysates from hek293t cells transiently transfected with orf cdna expression clones
hek293t cells from four fully confluent t <dig> tissue culture flasks were trypsinized and inoculated into  <dig>  <dig> cm-tissue culture plates. after culturing for  <dig> hrs, cells were transiently transfected with 5ug of trueorf cdna plasmid per plate. after transfection, the cells were cultured at 37°c for another  <dig> hrs. before cell lysate collection, transfected cells were washed once with 1xdpbs. next, 800ul of freshly-prepared native ripa lysis buffer  is added directly to the cells and the plates were incubated on ice for  <dig> minutes to lyse the cells completely. the  <dig> crude cell lysates were transferred to a 96-deep well plate with  <dig> ml capacity  and spun at  <dig> x rpm to remove insoluble cellular debris. the clarified supernatants were transferred to a 96-well v-shape plate  and stored at -80c for future protein microarray printing. the recombinant protein expression for every overexpression lysate used for microarray printing was validated by western-blot analysis with the anti-ddk antibody .

protein microarray printing
all overexpression lysates used for array printing were obtained from origene technologies inc. the detailed protocol for overexpression lysate production is described as above. protein microarray printing was performed with qarray <dig> array printer  with  <dig>  <dig> um xsmp <dig> split pins. grace biolab ovid 20x <dig> mm nitrocellulose slides were used for printing. the array contains a total of  <dig>  spots with  <dig>  lysates in duplicates  and  <dig> control spots. the whole slide is divided into  <dig> sub-arrays . for each subarray,  <dig> samples were spotted in 22x <dig> format. as an orientation marker control, each subarray contains an autofluorescent bsa-cy <dig> and cy <dig> mixture spot and a mixed igg spot . there are also additional sub-array controls including a buffer only negative control, a  <dig> mg/ml bsa control and a  <dig> mg/ml hek293t lysate control. in addition to above subarray controls, we also added specific global positive and quantification controls. these controls include serially-diluted igg mixture controls placed in sub-arrays c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  as global negative control, serially diluted hek293t lysates were spotted in subarrays a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  since every cdna clone used for overexpression lysate production contains a ddk epitope tag, the recombinant protein expression level can be detected by using the 4c <dig> monoclonal anti-ddk antibody . because the protein expression level for different genes varies greatly, two highly purified ddk fusion proteins were used as reference standards for the purpose of quantification. these two standards are gst and beta-actin. they are located either in subarray d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> for gst or subarray b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> for beta-actin.

protein microarray immuno-hybridization assay
before probing, the array chips were hydrated for at least  <dig> min in  <dig> ml distilled water followed by a  <dig> min equilibration with  <dig> ml wash buffer .

primary antibody was diluted to 5– <dig> μg/ml in  <dig> ml blocking buffer , thermo) and added to the array in a proplate chamber . the arrays were then incubated overnight at 5c with rocking. after overnight antibody incubation, arrays were washed briefly with  <dig> ml of wash buffer, transferred to perfect western 6-sectional short  slide tray and then washed three times with  <dig> ml of wash buffer for  <dig> minutes each time.

dylight 649-conjugated secondary antibody  was diluted 1: <dig> in wash buffer, added to the array slide, and then incubated for another  <dig> min at rt with rocking. after incubation, the stained arrays were washed extensively with distilled water and air-dried. the arrays were scanned with a genepix 4100a scanner and data were analyzed using the appropriate gal file. the antibodies used for protein microarray chip analysis include rabbit polyclonal anti-ercc <dig>  , anti-ercc <dig>  , and anti-ercc <dig>  

tissue microarray production and immunohistochemistry
the tissue microarray chip was generated using sakura’s tissue-tek quick-ray system. on one slide,  <dig> human normal and  <dig> human carcinoma tissue samples were spotted. for immunohistochemical staining of the tissue-microarray chip and paraffin-embedded tissue sections, antigen retrieval was carried out in  <dig>  m sodium citrate buffer at ph  <dig> in a pressure cooker for  <dig> minutes. samples were blocked with 5% non-fat milk plus 5% goat serum for  <dig> min and then incubated with primary antibody at a 1: <dig> dilution for  <dig> min at room temperature. the primary antibody signal was detected using polink- <dig> anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody for  <dig> min and dab substrate for  <dig> min at room temperature . hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. the antibodies used for ihc analysis include anti-pcyt1a  , anti-ercc <dig>  , anti-ercc <dig>  .

quantitative real-time pcr
tissuescan  <dig> lung cancer panels  were used to examine ercc <dig> and pcyt1a mrna expression profiles. the qpcr was performed on abi 7900ht using the sybr green pcr master mix . primers used for ercc <dig> mrna detection were hp <dig> with 5′-gctggctaagatgtgtatcctgg-3′  and 5-atcaggaggtccgctggtttct- <dig> , for pcyt1a were hp <dig> with 5′-gttccttccaaagtgcagcgct-3′  and 5-aggagttcctctgctggcttct- <dig>  for β-actin were hp <dig> with 5′-cagccatgtacgttgctatccagg-3′  and 5-aggtccagacgcaggatggcatg- <dig> . relative quantification of ercc <dig> and pcyt1a expression were measured by normalization against β-actin using the Δct method. the pcr efficiency values of e, e and ewere determined using the copy number standards, hk <dig>  hk <dig> and hk <dig> respectively .

immunoblotting and recombinant protein affinity purification
for immunoblotting, overexpression lysates  or purified proteins were mixed with 4xsds sample buffer , boiled for  <dig> minutes before loading on sds-page for fractionation. after separation on sds-page gel, they were electro-blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. anti-ddk , anti-ercc <dig>   or anti-ercc <dig>   was used for immunoblotting.

for affinity purification of recombinant protein, hek293t cells were first transiently transfected with an origene trueorf cdna clone . after  <dig> hrs, transfected cells were collected and lysed with ripa buffer  and the cellular debris were removed by high speed centrifugation. for affinity purification, anti-ddk agarose beads were first balanced with ripa buffer, and then added to pre-cleared overexpression lysates for overnight incubation. after incubation, the beads were extensively washed and purified proteins were eluted from the beads using a  <dig>  m glycine-hcl  solution.

RESULTS
development of a high density overexpression lysate protein microarray chip for the evaluation of antibody specificity
figure
 <dig> is the basic production scheme for this protein microarray chip. in summary,  <dig>  unique overexpression lysates were spotted in duplicate on a single nitrocellulose coated glass slide. the detailed description of protein microarray production and calibration is provided in the materials and methods section. to ensure that the immunoassay experiments with these chips are reproducible and interpretable, multiple internal controls were spotted on the chip .

using a high density protein microarray chip to evaluate the target specificity of anti-ercc <dig> monoclonal antibodies
to evaluate the 8f <dig> target specificity, this antibody was incubated at 5ug/ml concentration with the protein microarray chip. as suspected from bhagwat et al, 8f <dig> not only reacts with its authentic target ercc <dig> protein, but also binds strongly with an un-related nuclear protein, pcyt1a . pcyt1a is an important enzyme in regulating phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and nuclear membrane expansion
 <cit> . the functionality of this protein is actively regulated by a rapid translocation between a cytoplasmic soluble form that is inactive and a nuclear membrane-associated form that is activated
 <cit> . no published data show any correlation between pcyt1a expression levels and patient response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

rabbit polyclonal antibody fl <dig> is another commonly used anti-ercc <dig> ihc antibody. studies from a number of groups suggested that the target specificity for fl <dig> could be considerably better than 8f <dig> under their ihc experimental conditions
 <cit> . to evaluate the specificity of this antibody, protein microarray chip hybridization and western blot confirmation were performed. in comparison with the 8f <dig> monoclonal antibody, this rabbit antibody exhibits much broader cross-reactivity and higher background signals across the entire chip . on subarrays 2c and 2d, fl <dig> reacts with two ercc <dig> recombinant protein isoforms encoded by two different transcript variants. however, it also shows strong cross-reactivity with two unrelated protein targets, pdk <dig> and fermt <dig>  this cross-reactivity was confirmed by wb analyses of pdk <dig> and fermt <dig> overexpression lysates . pdk <dig> is a central mediator of cellular signaling between pi- <dig> kinase and various intracellular serine/threonine kinases, including protein kinase b, p <dig> ribosomal s <dig> kinase, serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, and protein kinase c. fermt <dig> is a focal adhesion molecule implicated in integrin activation. so far there are no published results linking the protein or gene expression levels of either pdk <dig> or fermt <dig> with the patient response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. in terms of subcellular localization, neither of these two cross-reactive proteins is located in the nuclear region. these data are well correlated with previous observations that ihc immunostaining with fl <dig> shows some cytoplasmic staining
 <cit> .

immunoassay analysis to confirm the protein microarray hybridization data with cross-reactive targets
to further confirm the protein microarray data, western blot analyses were performed with origene’s verify™ overexpression lysates. as negative controls, we included  <dig> different ercc family members on the same wb to confirm the antibody specificity. figure
2b is the representative wb data with clone 8f <dig> . from this data, it is clear that 8f <dig> not only recognizes ercc <dig> protein, but also pcyt1a strongly. no cross-reactivity was observed with other ercc family members. the wb membrane was also re-blotted with anti-ddk antibody to confirm the expression of the different recombinant proteins for each of the input lysates .

one of the intrinsic questions with this wb data is that the sds-page gel migration location of ercc <dig> and pcyt1a molecule is barely distinguishable, even though pcyt1a is  <dig> kda larger than ercc <dig>  this observation is well correlated with the previous publication from bhagwat nr, et al
 <cit> . by using an ercc <dig> depleted cell line, they detected an unidentified 8f <dig> cross-reactive nuclear protein with similar molecular weight. although this data could be explained as the abnormal sds-page migration pattern of pcyt1a protein itself, it is also possible that the observed wb signal could be due to up-regulated endogenous ercc <dig> protein upon transient overexpression of pcyt1a. to distinguish between these possibilities, we performed immunoassays with highly purified recombinant proteins instead of crude overexpression cell lysates. the sds-page gel electrophoresis data in figure
3a shows that the highly purified ercc <dig> and pcyt1a recombinant proteins exhibit very similar migration patterns. in order to compare the immunoreactive signal strength between 8f <dig> and these two highly purified recombinant proteins, equivalent amounts of protein were loaded on each lane for wb analysis. interestingly, our data shows that wb band intensity is also nearly identical . these data demonstrate that 8f1indeed binds pcyt1a protein with similar affinity to its authentic target, ercc <dig> protein.

one possible explanation for this antibody cross-reactivity could be high sequence homology between its authentic target and the cross-reactive protein. to understand whether there is any amino acid sequence homology, we carried out an amino acid sequence alignment of ercc <dig> and pcyt1a. no significant homology was detected . however, it is possible that the epitope recognized by 8f <dig> is a discontinuous epitope and that a similar conformational epitope exists on pcyt1a because 8f <dig> was generated by using full length human recombinant ercc <dig> protein as immunogen.

monoclonal antibodies are produced by hybridoma cell lines, which are generated by the fusion between an antibody secreting b cell and a myeloma cell. whether multiple b cells can fuse with one myeloma cell and produce different antibodies from a single hybridoma clone is still under-debate
 <cit> . if this does occur, it raises the possibility that multiple antibodies can be secreted from one hybridoma. alternatively, hybridoma clone impurity could also attribute to the contamination of 8f <dig> antibody preparation. to evaluate contamination as the source of cross-reactivity, a set of immunogen absorption experiments were performed. as shown in figure
3c, the immunoreactivities toward both pcyt1a and ercc <dig> were ablated effectively after the pre-absorption with purified pcyt1a protein. however, no signal depletion was observed under the control experimental condition that used purified bsa protein as the negative control . these data clearly demonstrate that a single 8f <dig> igg molecule exhibits bi-specific binding capacity towards both ercc <dig> and pcyt1a protein.

the immunohistochemical staining of nsclc tissue sections with anti-ercc <dig> and anti-pcyt1a monoclonal antibodies
ercc <dig> protein is proposed as an important biomarker for clinicians to predict whether a certain patient population with non-small cell lung carcinoma  will respond to cisplatin chemotherapy
 <cit> . for pathological evaluation via the application of ihc analysis, nuclear immunostaining intensity is the critical measurement.

the 8f <dig> cross-reactive protein, pcyt1a, is a nuclear membrane protein. however, previous immunocytochemistry studies indicated that the subcellular localization for pcyt1a is dynamically regulated under different physiological conditions and it can switch between an inactive soluble or cytoplasmic form to an active, membrane-bound species within the nucleus
 <cit> . there are very few reports of immunohistochemistry analysis of pcyt1a protein in different tissues and those data are highly controversial
 <cit> .

to check the subcellular distribution pattern for pcyt1a protein in nsclc tissue samples, ihc experiments were performed in parallel using either the rabbit monoclonal anti-pcyt1a or mouse 8f <dig> anti-ercc <dig> antibody. representative ihc images are in figure
 <dig>  these data clearly show that pcyt1a ihc staining is localized primarily in the nucleus compartment and that the staining pattern is very similar to that seen with the anti-ercc <dig> 8f <dig> clone.

to further survey the pcyt1a protein tissue expression profile, ihc analyses were performed on a tissue microarray slide containing  <dig> normal human tissue samples and  <dig> corresponding human tumor tissue samples. the ihc data with positive staining are shown in additional file
3: figures s3a and additional file
4: figure s3b. in summary, pcyt1a is primarily localized within nucleus under our current experimental conditions.

comparison of ercc <dig> and pcyt1a mrna transcript levels by qpcr analysis on lung cancer patient tissue samples
western blot analysis showed that there is no significant difference in terms of the binding efficiency for 8f <dig> to ercc <dig> or to pcyt1a and our ihc data also demonstrated that ercc <dig> and pcyt1a protein are colocalized within the nucleus compartment in nsclc patient tissue samples. to facilitate our understanding of how much 8f <dig> nuclear immunostaining signal might be coming from 8f1-pcyt1a interaction, we wanted to compare the endogenous protein expression levels for pcyt1a and ercc <dig> in lung cancer patients. however, the binding efficiency difference between each antibody-antigen pair would make it exceedingly difficult to estimate the endogenous protein expression level based on immunoassay data. thus, we used a qpcr method to compare the endogenous expression at the mrna level.

quantitative real-time pcr can provide direct measurements of mrnas level for different genes in the same tumor tissue sample. to ensure pcr amplification occurs at the same efficiency and to obtain an absolute mrna copy number in the tissue mrna samples, origene’s gene-specific qpcr copy number standards were serial-diluted and used for ct value measurement. the final data are summarized and plotted in figure
5a. our data show that the gene-specific probes chosen for ercc <dig> and pcyt1a exhibit similar amplification efficiencies with their target genes. a copy number calculation formula was also created based on the standard curves.

to examine the gene expression levels for ercc <dig> and pcyt1a in different cancer patient tissue samples, we performed qpcr analysis on origene’s lung cancer qpcr tissuescan cdna array panel, which contains cdna from  <dig> lung cancer patient tissues. the final result is presented in figure
5b. the majority of samples show that the mrna expression level for ercc <dig> is higher than that of pcyt1a. however, four lung cancer patient samples exhibited higher pcyt1a mrna expression levels than ercc <dig> mrna expression. this clearly demonstrates that in a certain lung cancer patient population, a significant amount of 8f <dig> immunoreactive signal could come from the 8f1-pcyt1a interaction and argues against the use of the 8f <dig> clone for ercc <dig> ihc diagnostic assays. it also highlights the need to generate a highly mono-specific monoclonal antibody for ercc <dig> clinical applications.

using a high density protein microarray chip to develop the most specific monoclonal anti-ercc <dig> antibody for diagnostic ihc testing
to obtain highly mono-specific antibodies for ercc <dig> ihc application, we used full-length human recombinant ercc <dig> protein as the immunogen. this protein was purified from hek293t cells that were transiently transfected with an ercc <dig> cdna clone . to ensure that we would generate the best ihc mabs against ercc <dig>  we performed more than  <dig> fusions and got  <dig> positively validated hybridoma clones. all  <dig> mabs were evaluated by western-blotting the ercc <dig> overexpression lysate and whole cell lysates of endogenous protein from  <dig> different cell lines. our initial data showed that all  <dig> mabs worked well with the ercc <dig> overexpression lysate and four of them detected endogenous ercc <dig> protein by western blot with the cell line lysates .

to identify the most specific anti-ercc <dig> monoclonal antibodies for ihc application, we picked six different mabs for protein microarray hybridization experiments. although all of them can detect ercc <dig> on the protein microarray chip, only three of them exhibited specificity without any cross-reactivity . figure
6a is the representative protein microarray hybridization data on one of the clones, 4f <dig>  the data were further confirmed by wb analysis . to evaluate their performance in the ihc immunostaining application, two of the most specific clones, 4f <dig> and 2e <dig>  were used on nsclc ffpe tissue sections. figure
 <dig> shows that these two clones exhibit very distinct nuclear staining. further experimental evidence demonstrated that the immunoassay performance for 2e <dig> clone is actually even better than 4f <dig> clone and exhibits much stronger binding affinity towards ercc <dig> protein in native cell lines . in summary, we have successfully developed two highly specific anti-ercc <dig> monoclonal antibodies for ihc pathological application.

discussion
immunohistochemistry  is a widely used antibody-based assay for pathologists to semi-quantitatively measure tumor biomarker expression. due to the nature of ihc assay itself, the quality of ihc data depends heavily on the quality of the antibody. therefore, to develop a validated ihc assay for clinical usage, the first step is to identify antibodies with the highest specificity on their authentic targets. clinical studies have shown that the level of ercc <dig> gene expression in cancer patients is correlated to drug resistance of cisplatin-based chemotherapy
 <cit> . currently, there is no clinically approved ercc <dig> ihc diagnostic assay available, likely due to the lack of a high quality anti-ercc <dig> monoclonal antibody. studies from a number of labs have shown that the 8f <dig> clone gives the best performance on nsclc tissue in ihc assays
 <cit> . however, bhagwat, et al. claimed that 8f <dig> is not mono-specific
 <cit> . by using an ercc <dig> gene-ablated fibroblast cell line, they found that 8f <dig> can still binds to a specious immunoreactive band exhibiting a similar sds-page migration pattern as ercc <dig>  interestingly, immunofluorescence experiments showed that this spurious 8f <dig> binding protein also localized in the nucleus. in this study, we have successfully identified pcyt1a, a nuclear membrane protein, as the 8f <dig> cross-reactive protein. we also found that pcyt1a exhibits similar biochemical and immunohistochemical properties as the spurious target discovered by bhagwat et al. for example, pcyt1a shows a similar migration pattern as ercc <dig> protein on sds-page gel even though it has a predicted molecular weight  <dig> kda greater than ercc <dig>  and pcyt1a is localized exclusively in the nucleus by ihc. alignment of the primary protein sequences showed no significant sequence homology between ercc <dig> and pcyt1a, thus, it is likely that 8f <dig> recognizes a common conformational epitope on these two proteins. although the 8f <dig> antibody binds equally well with ercc <dig> or pcyt1a protein, there is no evidence that these two proteins share any functional relationship in development of drug resistance of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. obviously, if a pathologist chose to use 8f <dig> antibody for ercc <dig> protein expression evaluation, a potentially confounded result would be generated.

it is without question that high specificity is the pre-requisite for any antibody to be used for clinical diagnosis. our data with 8f <dig> demonstrated that even a monoclonal antibody might not be mono-specific. therefore, it is very critical to evaluate the specificity for every antibody to be utilized clinically. scientists have spent years working to develop technologies to evaluate antibody specificity but we still do not have a platform that can address this question universally. at this stage, western blot is the most commonly used approach to evaluate antibody specificity
 <cit> . a single wb band at the right molecular weight is considered the primary criteria for antibody specificity. however, there are still a number of intrinsic issues that could lead to the wrong conclusion regarding antibody specificity. for example, the sds-page gel migration patterns for certain proteins, especially membrane proteins, do not always align well with their theoretically predicted molecular weights
 <cit> . in another case, if a cross-reactive protein co-migrates with the authentic target on sds-page gel, it will be extremely difficult for us to distinguish them. for some target genes, the expression may be regulated in a highly temporal and spatial manner making an assessment by w. blotting uninformative from a clinical perspective
 <cit> . therefore, it is difficult to find a single type of cell line or tissue to evaluate antibody specificity in an unbiased way. the ultimate goal for antibody specificity testing is to evaluate whether a particular antibody will only bind to its authentic target, but not with other proteins within the human genome. therefore, under the dream scenario, this antibody should be tested against every single human protein in the genome, which could be impossible to carry out practically. the protein microarray chip with its high throughput capacity provides a perfect technology platform. since each protein target is spotted and annotated at a specific site on the chip, tens of thousands of target specific immuno-reactions can be performed simultaneously. in this study, we utilized origene verify™ overexpression lysates collection for protein microarray chip generation. one of the major concerns is whether the endogenous protein expression within hek293t cells will potentially create a background signal that masks the specific target on each crude lysate spot. according to our data, we found that the protein expression level for most of the exogenously expressed recombinant proteins is hundreds or even thousands times higher than their endogenous counterparts . this is partly due to the utilization of a strong cmv promoter to boost the transcription level and to the presence of large t antigen within hek293t that permits amplification of the transfected plasmids containing an sv <dig> replication origin. we also have data showing that a large number of membrane proteins, which are nearly impossible to purify, can be produced in large quantities in hek293t cells and extracted efficiently under our lysis buffer conditions . in this study, our experimental data clearly demonstrate that this chip is a perfect tool for antibody specificity testing. we believe that every potential diagnostic or therapeutic antibody should be evaluated on a genome-wide coverage protein microarray chip for mono-specificity before application in a clinical setting.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we developed a high density protein microarray chip for antibody specificity evaluation. with this technology, we screened a number of commonly used anti-ercc <dig> antibodies and discovered that 8f <dig>  the most cited monoclonal antibody in clinical studies, is not specific. this antibody not only reacts with its authentic target, but also cross-reacts with pcyt1a, a nuclear membrane protein with no clinical implication on cisplatin drug resistance. in the meantime, we also generated two ihc mouse monoclonal antibodies with exclusive target specificity, which were proofed by the high density protein microarray chip platform. antibodies from these two clones, 2e <dig> and 4f <dig>  also demonstrated superior performance on ihc application with nsclc patient ffpe tissue sections.
