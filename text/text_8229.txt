BACKGROUND
many intracellular bacteria have developed strategies to hijack the intracellular trafficking machinery of the host cell in order to escape lysosomal degradation ensuring their survival and their replication  <cit> . for example, mycobacterium tuberculosis blocks the maturation of phagosomes into the degradative phagolysosomes by producing lipids that mimic the phosphoinositides and inhibit the fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes  <cit> . some bacteria, including coxiella burnetii, legionella pneumophila and staphylococcus aureus can survive and replicate for some time in autophagosome-like vacuoles by delaying  <cit>  or by blocking  <cit>  their maturation into autophagolysosomes.

after its uptake by hela cells, brucella abortus is recovered in a vacuole  that transiently interacts with early and late endosomes and perhaps lysosomes, successively acquiring markers of endosomal compartments such as eea <dig> , rab <dig>  rab <dig> and lamp- <dig>   <cit> . during these different steps of maturation, the bcv becomes acidic allowing the expression of genes encoding the virb type iv secretion system   <cit> . brucella avoids lysosomal degradation by blocking the phagosome-lysosome fusion probably by a mechanism dependent on lipid rafts and perhaps on cyclic ß- <dig> -glucans . afterwards, the bcv interacts in a sustained way with subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum, called eres  and at around 12 h p.i., brucella abortus starts to replicate in er-derived vesicles labelled with er specific markers, such as sec61ß and calnexin  <cit> . later on, from 48 h p.i., starr et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that these replicative bcv  could be converted into lamp- <dig> and rab7-positive compartments  that would be involved in the completion of the intracellular brucella lifecycle and could promote its cell-to-cell spreading  <cit> .

earlier studies had already revealed that some bacteria resided in autophagosome-like vacuoles characterized by multilamellar membranes after 24 h of infection and that brucella replication was increased when macroautophagy was activated by serum starvation, suggesting that b. abortus transits through the autophagic pathway before reaching its replicative compartment  <cit> . since then, many proteins implicated in the regulation of macroautophagy  have been discovered  <cit> . the initiation of autophagosome formation requires the ulk complex and the class iii phosphatidylinositol 3-p kinase  complex. the nucleation of the isolation membrane requires the recruitment of additional atg proteins and autophagy-specific ptdinsp effectors  <cit> . the expansion of the isolation membrane relies on two ubiquitylation-like reactions. the first one drives the conjugation of atg <dig> to atg <dig> in the presence of atg <dig> and atg <dig>  atg5-atg <dig> conjugates are non-covalently associated to atg16l  forming multimeric complexes of approximately 800 kda . the second reaction conjugates the cytosolic soluble lc3-i  to a phosphatidylethanolamine  in the presence of atg <dig>  atg <dig> and atg <dig> producing the membrane-associated lc3-ii form . the atg5-atg <dig> conjugates are essential for the maturation of the isolation membrane into autophagosome and targeting of lc <dig> to the membrane  <cit> .

recently, using epithelial cells and macrophages deficient in one of the regulatory proteins of the conventional macroautophagic pathway, starr et al.  <cit>  have found that core proteins of this canonical macroautophagy machinery such as ulk- <dig>  beclin <dig>  atg <dig>  atg <dig>  lc3b were not necessary for the intracellular trafficking of b. abortus between the endocytic compartments and the er-derived vesicles and for its replication  <cit> . nevertheless, the conversion of rbcv to abcv at a later stage of infection, i.e. 48 h and 72 h p.i., seems to be dependent on ulk- <dig>  beclin <dig>  atg14l and hvps <dig> but independent on atg <dig>  atg <dig>  atg16l <dig> and atg4b  <cit> . on the other hand, guo et al.  <cit>  have observed that infection by b. melitensis induced macroautophagy that in turn favoured its replication in raw <dig>  macrophages  <cit> . this later study raises the possibility that in contrast to b. abortus, b. melitensis could subvert macroautophagy to replicate in host cells. in our present work, we addressed this issue using embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type and atg5-knockout mice infected or not with b. abortus and b. melitensis.

RESULTS
relative abundance of lc3-i and lc3-ii in infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts
as it has been shown that b. melitensis stimulated macroautophagy in macrophages to favour its replication  <cit> , we sought to determine whether this also occurred in infected mefs. first, we established clones stably transfected with gfp-lc <dig> to monitor the formation of autophagic vacuoles by fluorescence microscopy. as expected  <cit> , in basal conditions, the fluorescent staining in gfp-lc <dig> expressing cells was faint and diffuse while under starvation conditions, it was more punctuate, due to the recruitment of lc <dig> onto autophagosomal membranes . in contrast, when the same cells were infected with b. abortus or with b. melitensis, the gfp-lc <dig> staining remained diffuse and colocalisation between gfp-lc <dig> and texas red-labelled bacteria was only very occasionally detected. then, we examined the relative abundance of lc3-i and lc3-ii by western blotting. preliminary experiments showed that in wt mefs, lc3-ii was detected even in basal conditions . after 2 h of starvation in ebss, the abundance of both lc3-i and lc3-ii decreased, probably due to an acceleration of the autophagic flow since lc3-ii is degraded when autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes. in contrast, the lc3-ii/lc3-i ratio increased in the presence of bafilomycin, a vacuolar h+-atpase inhibitor known to block autophagosome/lysosome fusion. as expected, in atg5−/− mefs, lc3-ii was never detected whatever the cell culture conditions because the presence of atg <dig> is absolutely required for the lc <dig> recruitment onto autophagosome membrane  <cit> . in wt mefs infected with b. abortus or with b. melitensis, the relative abundance of lc3-i and lc3-ii at 18 h p.i. did not change when compared to non-infected mefs .figure  <dig>

replication of b. abortus- and b. melitensis-mcherry in atg5−/− fibroblasts
we studied the contribution of the macroautophagic pathway on the replication of brucellae using atg5-deficient mefs. first, we infected cells with b. abortus-mcherry  or with b. melitensis-mcherry  for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  after inoculation, the medium was removed and replaced by a medium containing gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria. as it can be seen on micrographs taken after increasing times postinfection, b. abortus-mcherry is able to enter, survive and replicate in mefs, even in atg5-deficient mefs. in both cell lines, at 6 h p.i, there are only a few bacteria per infected cell but this number massively increases between  <dig> and 18 h p.i. and at 24 h p.i., the bacteria are so abundant that it is difficult to enumerate them. b. melitensis-mcherry is also able to replicate in both wt mefs and atg5−/− mefs. however, it is clear that the number of bacteria per infected cell at 24 h p.i. is lower compared to b. abortus-mcherry. statistical analysis of these observations revealed that there is no significant difference in the number of b. abortus-mcherry per infected cell between the atg5-deficient mefs and the wt mefs whatever the time postinfection . in contrast, the number of b. melitensis-mcherry per infected cell significantly increased in atg5−/− mefs when compared to wt mefs at 9 h, 18 h and 24 h p.i. . these data demonstrate that both brucella strains can survive and replicate when the conventional atg5-dependent macroautophagic pathway is impaired. atg5-deficient cells seem to be even more permissive for b. melitensis replication than wt mefs.figure  <dig>

counting of viable bacteria in atg5−/− fibroblasts
the counting of cfus in the gentamicin survival assay represents a common way to investigate the survival and the replication of bacteria in host cells. in agreement with our morphological observations, we noticed that b. abortus grew at an exponential rate as a function of time postinfection both in wt and atg5−/− mefs . there was even a slight increase in the log cfu in atg5−/− mefs as compared to wt mefs. a student’s t-test on each time point indicated that the difference between the wt and atg5−/− mefs was significant only at 12 h p.i. nevertheless, a two-way anova statistical analysis on all time points combined revealed that there was a highly significant increase in the log cfu in atg5−/− mefs when compared to wt mefs . the same observation was made with b. melitensis . this global increase could result from a more efficient uptake of bacteria rather than from a higher replication rate in atg5−/− mefs compared to wt mefs. alternatively, this increase in log cfu could be linked to a lower bactericidal capacity of atg5-deficient cells compared to wt cells at early stages of infection.figure  <dig>

intracellular replication of b. abortus and b. melitensis in the presence of 3-methyladenine
previous studies have shown that incubation of cells in the presence of 3-methyladenine , an inhibitor of class iii pi3k often used to block macroautophagy  <cit> , impaired the replication of b. abortus  <cit>  and b. melitensis  <cit>  in hela cells and in raw <dig>  macrophages, respectively. these data are in contradiction with our results showing that both bacterial strains are able to replicate in atg5-deficient mefs. therefore, we sought to determine the putative impact of 3ma on the replication of brucellae in wt mefs. first, we assessed the number of b. abortus-mcherry per infected cell in wt mefs preincubated for 2 h in the presence or absence of 10 mm 3ma. as shown in figure 5a, this treatment had no significant impact on the number of bacteria per infected wt mef. similar results were obtained with wt mefs infected with b. melitensis-mcherry . however, in this case, we observed a significant decrease  in the number of bacteria per infected cell but only at 24 h p.i. next, we examined the impact of a pre-treatment with 3ma on brucella replication in host cells using the gentamicin survival assay. our results show that a pre-incubation of wt mefs with 3ma does not impair the replication of both b. abortus and b. melitensis .figure  <dig>

discussion
after internalisation, b. abortus is found inside individual vacuoles that interact transiently with endosomes and perhaps lysosomes  <cit> . then, brucella evades the endocytic pathway and reaches its replicative niche, an er-derived compartment, by a still unknown mechanism. it is also unclear whether brucella transits through the autophagic pathway before its replication. based on the appearance of b. abortus in multilamellar structures looking like autophagosomes and on the decrease of its replication rate after autophagy inhibition with 3ma, pizarro-cerda et al.  <cit>  proposed that this bacterium passed through the autophagy pathway before reaching its niche of replication  <cit> . in agreement with this assumption, guo et al.  noticed that inoculation of macrophages with b. melitensis stimulated autophagy and that a pre-treatment with 3ma reduced its growth rate  <cit> . in contrast, using macrophages derived from ko mice or hela cells incubated in the presence of sirna targeting the autophagic machinery, starr et al.  <cit>  showed that b. abortus does not use the conventional macroautophagic pathway either for its intracellular trafficking between the endocytic compartments and the er derived-vesicles or for its replication  <cit> . in our study, we sought to compare the fate of b. abortus and b. melitensis in atg5-deficient mefs, i.e. in cells that are unable to set up the conventional pathway of macroautophagy even under starvation conditions.

our results show that both brucella strains are able to invade and replicate in atg5−/− mefs, indicating that atg <dig> is dispensable for the intracellular survival and replication not only of b. abortus but also of b. melitensis. we observed even a slight but significant increase in the log cfu in atg5−/− mefs infected with b. abortus or with b. melitensis when compared to wt mefs, all time points combined. the counting of fluorescent bacteria per infected cell, which takes into account living bacteria but also dead bacteria and bacteria that are no longer able to replicate, indicates that for b. abortus, there is no difference between the two cell lines even at short times postinfection  whereas for b. melitensis, there is a significant increase in the atg5−/− mefs at  <dig>  18 h and 24 h. p.i., as compared to wt mefs . therefore, for b. abortus, the higher cfus in atg5−/− mefs vs wt mefs could be explained by an increase in the percentage of infected cells among the cell population or by a higher survival rate during the early times after infection rather than by a higher replication rate. in contrast, for b. melitensis, the increase in the log cfu in atg5-deficient cells could also result from a slight increase in the replication rate.

next, our data reveal that there is no conversion of lc3-i to lc3-ii in wt mefs upon brucella invasion and that neither b. abortus nor b. melitensis is detected in autophagic compartments stained with gfp-lc <dig>  even under starvation conditions. this is consistent with the results of starr et al.  <cit> , which also showed that the sirna-mediated silencing of lc3b in hela cells did not impair the maturation of the bcv into a replicative niche in cells infected with b. abortus. in contrast, guo et al.  <cit>  proposed that b. melitensis infection induced autophagy because they observed an accumulation of gfp-lc3-positive autophagic vacuoles and a conversion of lc3-i to lc3-ii in infected raw <dig>  macrophages, compared to control cells. moreover, these authors showed that a treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3ma attenuated the replication efficiency of b. melitensis. it is not clearly indicated how long they incubated cells with this compound but it has been demonstrated that under nutrient-rich conditions, a prolonged treatment  with 3ma could promote rather than inhibit the autophagy flux  <cit> . in contrast to guo et al.,  <cit> , we did not observe a significant decrease in the cfu and in the number of brucella per infected cells  in wt mefs pretreated with 3ma. this discrepancy could be explained either by the incubation conditions or by a cell-type specificity. the subversion of the autophagic pathway by b. melitensis could occur in raw <dig>  macrophages but not in mefs.

given the multifactorial effects of 3ma on cell metabolism  <cit> , cells derived from atg <dig> ko mice represent a more reliable tool to study the role of autophagy in different biological situations  <cit> . based on our results with atg5−/− mefs, it is obvious that b. melitensis 16m as well as b. abortus are able to replicate in cells deficient in the canonical macroautophagy pathway. however, we cannot rule out the involvement of autophagosomes formed by an atg <dig> and atg7-independent alternative macroautophagy. indeed, it has been demonstrated that the incubation of atg5−/− mef with etoposide, a proapoptotic molecule, induced autophagosome formation without conversion of lc3-i to lc3-ii  <cit> . likewise, starr et al.  <cit>  have shown that the conversion of rbcvs into abcv that occurs at a very late stage after infection with b. abortus does not require several core autophagic proteins, of which atg <dig> and lc3b  <cit> . these findings demonstrate that autophagic vacuoles can be formed in atg5-deficient cells. however, these alternative macroautophagy pathways, independent of atg <dig> and lc <dig>  are inhibited by 3ma  <cit> . thus, if brucella subverts an alternative macroautophagy pathway to reach its replicative niche in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, it should proceed by another mechanism because in our conditions of incubation, the replication efficiency is not impaired in wt mefs treated with 3ma.

finally, it has been demonstrated that the intracellular trafficking of b. abortus and b. melitensis could be different in some human trophoblastic cell lines  <cit> . therefore, it could be interesting to study the involvement of the conventional and the alternative macroautophagy pathways in other cell types, such as trophoblasts and peritoneal or bone marrow-derived macrophages.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our data indicate on one hand that cell invasion with b. abortus and b. melitensis does not induce macroautophagy in wt mefs and on the other hand, that both brucella strains can replicate in atg5-deficient mefs.
