BACKGROUND
cultivated edible banana and plantains are derived from the progenitor species musa acuminata colla  and musa balbisiana colla , which are both members of the section eumusa. these commodity fruit crops are amongst the most important across tropical and sub-tropical regions, contributing to food security, nutrition and poverty alleviation. global annual production from over  <dig> countries on  <dig> continents is estimated to be approximately  <dig> million tonnes  <cit> .

global movement of musa germplasm from its’centre of origin in southeast asia and the pacific region has resulted in a spread of pests and disease, causing major constraints to banana production. biotic stresses include fungi, bacteria, viruses, nematodes and insects. in excess of  <dig> fungal pathogens cause disease in banana  <cit> , with three species of the genus mycosphaerella recognized as important foliar pathogens. as causal members of the sigatoka disease complex, mycosphaerella fijiensis is responsible for black leaf streak disease, mycosphaerella musicola for sigatoka leaf spot disease, and mycosphaerella eumusae for eumusae leaf spot. m. musicola was the first mycosphaerella pathogen to be recorded on banana, spreading from java  in  <dig> to most of the world’s production areas in the 1960s  <cit> . with a preference for higher altitudes and cooler temperatures, it is typically a greater problem during rainy seasons in subtropical banana growing regions  <cit> . foliar necrotic lesions and diminished photosynthetic capacity cause reductions in fruit number and size per bunch, with premature fruit ripening observed in the field and post-harvest. estimated production losses vary between  <dig> and 100%, given that infected fruits have no commercial value  <cit> .

as disease resistance is absent in most cultivated varieties, in particular members of the cavendish subgroup, control is largely based upon agronomic management practices and application of protectant and systemic fungicides. in addition to increasing production costs, long term dependence upon agrochemical control increases selection pressure for fungicide resistance or tolerance development in pathogen populations. resistance to benzimidazole, triazole and strobilurin systemic fungicides has been reported in the genus mycosphaerella <cit> .

given the susceptibility to an ever-increasing range of pests and diseases, development of resistant cultivars through genetic improvement is of fundamental importance for sustainable disease management. in contrast to fertility in wild diploid musa genotypes, commercial triploid and diploid cultivars are seedless and parthenocarpic, with fruit development via parthenocarpy. with maintenance of such plants by vegetative propagation  <cit> , somatic mutation-driven evolution has resulted in a crop with a narrow genetic base, with many genotypes lacking resistance to pests and disease. conventional genetic improvement is hindered principally by male and female sterility, with approaches time-consuming and demanding in terms of land use. for example, current hybridization strategies for the development of resistant tetraploid varieties rely upon sexually active wild or improved fertile m. acuminata diploids, which provide sources of resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, for crossing with established semi-fertile triploid genotypes  <cit> . success can be limited, however, given low numbers or absence of seeds. complementary strategies for resolving constraints for musa improvement are also under development, with molecular and tissue-culture approaches including mutagenesis, somaclonal variation, somatic hybridization and genetic modification via plant transformation .

genetic modification of musa requires access to genomic information, including expression analysis of gene models under different conditions. nuclear genome size has been reported to range from 534– <dig> mbp in the genus, with variation observed between species and among m. acuminata genotypes  <cit> . the publication in july  <dig> of a 90% complete draft of a reference whole genome sequence for a double haploid of m. acuminata ssp. malaccensis var. pahang  reported a genome size of  <dig> mbp, with  <dig>  predicted gene models  <cit> . although banana is one of the world’s most important edible crops, comprehensive diverse transcriptome datasets, complementary to a whole genome reference sequence, are required for use in accelerated molecular-based breeding in this genus. publically available datasets currently contain  <dig> ests for m. acuminata and  <dig> for m. balbisiana , numbers which represent only a fraction of the total number of unigene sequences expected to be present in the whole transcriptome. examples of developed datasets include those from different genotypes, plant tissues  <cit>  and during ripening  <cit> . examination of gene expression in relation to drought tolerance has also been reported  <cit> . only limited analysis of gene expression in response to fungal biotic stresses has been reported. examples for economically important pathosystems include musa-fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense <cit>  and musa-m. fijiensis <cit> .

next generation sequencing  of uncloned cdna is appropriate for whole genome transcriptome characterization and gene discovery. today’s available  <dig> gs flx platform with titanium chemistry allows for read lengths of  <dig> bases, such that accurate de novo assembly of transcripts can be achieved.  <dig> transcriptome pyrosequencing has now been conducted in numerous important plants including arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , oryza longistaminata <cit> medicago sativa <cit>  and phaseolus vulgaris <cit> .  <dig> transcriptome analysis in plant-fungi pathosystems is also now being reported, for example in  <cit> .

in order to develop a functional genomics resource for m. acuminata, including transcriptome response data in relation to infection by the fungal pathogen m. musicola, we performed roche  <dig> pyrosequencing of expressed genes in genotypes contrasting in resistance to sigatoka leaf spot disease. total rna was extracted from whole plant leaf material from the wild diploid genotype m. acuminata ssp. burmannicoides calcutta  <dig>  and the commercial triploid m. acuminata subgroup cavendish cv. grande naine , both uninfected and challenged with the pathogen. transcriptome datasets were also exploited for large scale gene-based marker development.

RESULTS
the objectives of this work were to generate a transcriptome resource for m. acuminata which includes genes expressed in banana-m. musicola interactions using highly susceptible  and completely resistant  genotypes. calcutta  <dig> is a wild fertile diploid widely employed in breeding programs for improvement of commercial cultivars . as a donor species, it is considered an important source of resistance to important fungal pathogens and nematodes. given this importance, it has been adopted as a model for comparative genomics with rice  <cit> , with functional genomics applications  <cit>  and candidate resistance gene discovery also reported  <cit> . cavendish subgroup bananas, such as grande naine, by contrast, are sterile triploids, which, although representing more than 40% of global production, lack resistance to biotic stresses, such that regular pesticide application is necessary for commercial production. in addition to unigene discovery for each genotype during this pathosystem interaction, large scale isolation of microsatellites and genic-ssr marker development was also conducted, for application in genetic mapping, genotyping and marker-assisted selection of specific traits in breeding populations.

 <dig> sequencing statistics and assembly
emulsion pcr and  <dig> pyrosequencing were conducted according to roche standard protocols using gs flx technology and titanium series chemistry. each cdna library was sequenced on a ¼ segment of a single plate run, generating  <dig>  raw sequence reads for the two genotypes, totalling over  <dig> megabases of sequence data. following adaptor sequence trimming and short read  removal, a total of  <dig>  high quality reads  were processed. table  <dig> shows a summary of size distribution for both genotype datasets.

calcutta  <dig> sequence reads were de novo assembled into  <dig>  unique unigene sequences, which included  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. of these, a total of  <dig>  unigenes were represented in the transcriptome dataset from non-infected leaves and  <dig>  in the dataset from pathogen-challenged leaves. in the case of cavendish grande naine sequences, a similar assembly pattern was observed, with a total of  <dig>  unigenes, composed of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons.  <dig>  unigenes were represented in the transcriptome dataset from non-infected leaves and  <dig>  in the dataset from pathogen-challenged leaves. singleton sequences which represent unique low level transcripts were generally of sufficient length to enable annotation, with an average length of  <dig> bp in calcutta  <dig> and  <dig> bp in cavendish grande naine. unigene contig length distributions for each genotype are shown in figure 1a. average contig lengths of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp were observed for calcutta  <dig> and cavendish grande naine, respectively. distribution of the number of reads in a unigene contig  were also similar in both assembled sequence datasets .

considering both contigs and singletons, the total number of genes per genotype corresponds well with the most recent estimate of  <dig>  protein-coding gene models in the reference genome sequence for m. acuminata ssp. malaccensis var. pahang   <cit> , which may reflect the stringent quality analysis and assembly parameters adopted. it must be recognized, however, that de novo assembly may over-estimate gene numbers as a result of non-overlapping sequence read members present for a single gene. alignment of contigs against the reference genome revealed such examples, with  <dig>  of the  <dig>  contigs in calcutta  <dig>  mapping to  <dig>  gene models, and similarly  <dig>  of the  <dig>  contigs in cavendish grande naine  mapping to  <dig>  reference genome gene models .

the high percentages of unigenes mapped to gene model exons validates both the de novo contig assemblies and gene annotation of the reference m. acuminata genome, overlaying important information in relation to host expression during this plant-pathogen interaction. through tblastx analysis of unmapped contigs, positive hits to genes in the ncbi est  database identified a further  <dig> potential unigenes in calcutta  <dig> and  <dig> in cavendish grande naine . although these unaligned gene sequence may be specific to the m. acuminata genotypes, this data may also indicate additional genes requiring further curation in the reference genome.

in order to gain insights into broad similarities and differences between transcriptome unigene datasets  for the two m. acuminata genotypes evaluated in this study, all gene models in the reference genome were used as a base for identification of common and distinct genes. a venn diagram  illustrates overlap between the genotypes, with  <dig>  common gene models identified to which mapped coverage of the query unigene sequence was greater than 90% and the percentage identity of the sequence relative to the genome was greater than 95%. this number represents  <dig> % of the mapped gene models for each genotype. although mapped unigenes specific to each genotype may be attributed to different evolutionary distances from m. acuminata ssp. malaccensis var. pahang, overlap between data sets is likely to correlate with  <dig> sequence coverage.

all sequence data from the study are available for each genotype in the sequence read archive  at the national center for biotechnology information  .

functional annotation and classification
annotation of assembled unigene sequences was conducted by sequence similarity searches against the ncbi non-redundant protein sequence database . blastx criteria were that the alignment length should be greater than  <dig> amino acids and the e-value cut-off at 10- <dig>  of the total estimated unigene sequences for calcutta  <dig>   <dig>  displayed significant identity to genes encoding proteins with known or putative function,  <dig>  to genes encoding proteins with unknown function, and  <dig>  showed no significant identity to any sequences in the database. similar results were observed for cavendish grande naine, with  <dig>  unigenes displaying significant identity to genes encoding proteins with known or putative function,  <dig>  to genes for proteins with unknown function, and  <dig>  showing no significant identity to any database sequences. unigene sequences and blast annotations are summarized in additional file  <dig>  the protein domain-searching tool interproscan  was used to further annotate sequences. a total of  <dig>  calcutta  <dig> unigenes contained interpro domains, with  <dig>  distinct domains represented in the unigene set. of the  <dig>  translated sequences with no significant blast hits,  <dig> showed functional protein domains. similarly,  <dig>  cavendish grande naine unigenes possessed interpro domains, with a total of  <dig>  interpro domains represented. a total of  <dig> out of the  <dig>  sequences with no significant hits to genbank database sequences were identified with interpro domains. the most representative domains in both unigene datasets are summarized in additional file  <dig>  novelty rates for unigene datasets based upon blast and interpro analyses were  <dig> % in the case of calcutta  <dig> and  <dig> % for cavendish grande naine.

unigene sequences with significant homology to known plant proteins from the public database were abundant. on the basis of best blast hit analyses, respectively for calcutta  <dig> and cavendish grande naine unigenes, totals of  <dig>  and  <dig>  matched genes in rice ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  matched genes in maize ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  matched genes in sorghum ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  matched genes in grape , and  <dig>  and  <dig>  matched genes in arabidopsis thaliana . similar distributions were observed for m. acuminata dh-pahang gene families  <cit> . for both calcutta  <dig> and cavendish grande naine datasets, only  <dig> % of blast hits to homologous plant sequences matched those from the genbank nr protein database with a taxonomic filter for the genus musa, indicating that our data represents a considerable contribution to expressed unigenes for the genus.

functional classification of unigene sets was conducted through gene ontology  assignment using blast2go. data was categorized for each genotype across the three main go categories of biological process, cellular component and molecular function. calcutta  <dig> unigenes were assigned a total of  <dig>  go term annotations, with  <dig>  biological process terms representing  <dig> go levels,  <dig>  molecular function terms from  <dig> levels and  <dig>  cellular component terms from  <dig> levels. similar assignments were seen with cavendish grande naine unigene data, with  <dig>  go terms assigned across the three main categories. a total of  <dig>  biological process terms were assigned,  <dig>  molecular function terms and  <dig>  cellular component terms. within the biological process category, at go level two, the majority of unigenes were assigned to “cellular process” , metabolic process , “biological regulation” , “response to stimulus” , and “localization” . similarly, for molecular function, terms “binding” , “catalytic activity”  and “transporter activity”  were the most abundant assigned terms for the unigene datasets from both genotypes. across the cellular function category, the most abundant terms were “cellular component” , “cell” , “organelle”  and “macromolecular complex” . figure  <dig> summarises level  <dig> and  <dig> go annotation of unigenes.

musa-mycosphaerella interactions
m. musicola is a hemibiotrophic pathogen which penetrates leaf tissues through stomatal pores, following a period of epiphytic growth on the leaf surface. once inside the host, the pathogen colonizes the intercellular space within mesophyll tissue layers and palisade tissues, without forming haustoria or infecting host cells. this biotrophic phase can last for a number of weeks before the onset of symptoms of necrotic lesions in mesophyll cells. growth of conidiophores out through stomata then enables conidiospore development on the leaf surface. notable differences in disease development are seen in totally resistant genotypes, with early necrosis of stomatal guard cells and death of only a limited number of host cells at the site of infection. no fungal sporulation is observed in such incompatible interactions.

analysis of gene expression during banana-mycosphaerella interactions has been limited to date  <cit> , with our study, to the authors knowledge, the first massal transcriptome analysis for the m. acuminata-m. musicola pathosystem. a sequencing strategy for identification of transcripts from pathogen-challenged and unchallenged leaves was employed, with the preparation of two cdna libraries per genotype . given reports that during the early biotrophic phase of infection of banana with m. fijiensis, germ tubes penetrate stomata from  <dig> to 6dai  <cit> , a similar timecourse was employed for the m. acuminata-m. musicola pathosystem.

the use of detached leaf tissues in disease bioassays with mycosphaerella banana pathogens has been reported on occasion to give inconsistent results , with development of disease symptoms not always correlating with those typically observed on intact plants. additionally,  <cit>  suggested that the hemibiotrophic mycosphaerella banana pathogens require healthy banana plants for disease development, with  <cit>  suggesting that the physiological state of detached leaves is not comparable with those on whole plants with an intact root system. host gene expression in detached leaves during interaction with biotrophs has also been reported in arabidopsis to closer reflect plant senescence  <cit> . for these reasons, bioassays were conducted using intact young leaves from  <dig> month old plants, with optimal temperature and humidity conditions employed during the experiment.

on the basis of blastx search results against nr, blast2go annotation and assignment of unigenes to go terms related to defense  many unigenes potentially involved in plant effector-triggered immunity  and pamp-triggered immunity  were identified across both genotypes. pti is a branch of plant immunity which involves interactions between host pattern recognition receptor-like kinases  and pathogen-associated molecular patterns   <cit> . this branch involves a mitogen-associated protein  kinase cascade and wrky transcription factors, and is responsible for resistance to the majority of potential pathogens. eti  <cit> , is based upon the co-evolution of plant resistance r protein receptors and specific pathogen effector molecules, responsible for disease resistance at the intra-specific level. downstream signal transduction components can overlap between pti and eti, including an oxidative burst via the production of ros, alterations in plant hormone production and mapk signaling cascades.

expressed genes in calcutta  <dig> and cavendish grande naine
in silico analysis of gene expression together with blastx-derived annotation nomenclature revealed genes potentially involved in biotic stress responses in calcutta  <dig>  numerous transcription factors were identified, which are typically involved in regulation of plant development, signaling and response to environment, amongst other roles. many are also known to be involved in signal transduction and expression regulation of stress-responsive genes. transcripts observed in infected leaf tissues in calcutta  <dig> included a nac domain protein and ethylene insensitive-like protein  <dig>  a probable transcription factor acting as a positive regulator in the ethylene response pathway. plant r-gene-mediated recognition of a biotrophic pathogen avr gene product is associated with the hypersensitive response , which results in programmed cell death at the site of infection to limit pathogen spread  <cit> . in inoculated calcutta  <dig> plants, unigenes potentially involved in plant detoxification included a considerable presence of metallothionein-like proteins. these low molecular weight polypeptides sequester metal ions and are associated with regulation of intracellular redox potential and oxygen detoxification  <cit> , protecting cells from damaging effects of reactive oxygen species . ros generation may indicate hr activity, following pathogen infection and recognition. four distinct types  are known in plants, according to distribution of cysteine residues.  <cit>  reported isolation of types mt <dig> and mt <dig> in banana, with expression influenced in response to ethylene and metals. more recent examination has reported their abundance in m. acuminata calcutta  <dig>  <cit> . our study confirmed this, with mt <dig> and mt <dig> unigene contigs with considerable sequence depth. superoxide dismutase enzymes  were similarly observed in infected calcutta  <dig> leaves. like metallothioneins, these also act as antioxidants, protecting plant cell components from oxidation by ros. glutathione-s-transferases were also represented. these may be involved in cell signaling pathways as well as in detoxification of products of oxidative stress during hr. their expression in m. fijiensis-m. acuminata late stage compatible interactions has also recently been reported  <cit> . reported peaks in accumulation of h2o <dig> and peroxidase activity in calcutta  <dig> up to 10dai with m. fijiensis <cit>  are consistent with our observations of abundance of transcripts for genes involved in ros detoxification and hr during interaction with m. musicola. phenylpropanoids in plants are involved in a number of defense responses, including biosynthesis of antimicrobial compounds such as phytoalexins and molecules involved in signaling. an abundance of gene transcripts for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  was observed in calcutta  <dig> following challenge with the pathogen. this enzyme catalyses a reaction in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, with deamination of phenylalanine to cinnamic acid, leading to downstream synthesis of phytoalexins, as well as production of salicylic acid, a signal molecule involved in systemic acquired resistance . 4-coumarate-coa ligase, another important enzyme in the biosynthesis of flavonoids and isoflavonoids, was also observed.

blast nr-based functional annotation of expressed unigenes in cavendish grande naine revealed an abundance with homology to transcripts poorly characterized according to the ncbi. however, where descriptions could be used as a guide, numerous unigenes in infected leaves were identified as potentially involved in plant responses to biotic stress. these included transcription factors, metallothionein-like proteins and superoxide dismutases , 4-coumarate:coa ligase  <dig>  cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase and isoflavone reductase-like protein , and disease-related f-box protein and calmodulin binding protein . examples of unigenes with fewer counts in infected leaves when compared with non infected tissues included wrky transcription factor  <dig> and map kinase bimk <dig> , putative callose synthase  <dig> catalytic subunit , xyloglucan endotransglycosylase , endochitinases and putative chitinases , pathogenesis-related protein  <dig>  f-box, wd <dig> domain protein, hypersensitive-induced response protein , glutathione s-transferase  <dig> , type iii polyketide synthase  <dig>  cinnamate-4-hydroxylase , ctr1-like protein kinase, ethylene receptor-like protein, ethylene response factor  <dig> and ethylene-responsive transcriptional coactivator , respiratory burst oxidases  and thaumatin-like proteins .

a number of distinct plant disease resistance r-gene families are recognized as involved in eti and pti, based upon protein domains and cell function. the most abundant class code for cytoplasmic receptor proteins with nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat  domains  <cit> . in rice, approximately  <dig> nbs-lrr genes have been characterized, with  <dig> present in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> , and  <dig> identified in m. acuminata dh-pahang  <cit> . conservation of motifs within nucleotide-binding site leucine rich repeat domains has also enabled analyses of nbs-lrr r-gene family diversity across the genus . in the current study,  <dig> expressed nbs-lrr genes were identified through blast analysis from both infected and non-infected leaf tissues for calcutta  <dig> and  <dig> in cavendish grande naine. mapping of unigene contigs to gene models containing the nb-arc domain in the reference m. acuminata genome identified  <dig> contigs mapping to  <dig> gene models in the case of calcutta  <dig> transcriptome data and  <dig> cavendish grande naine contigs mapping to  <dig> gene models . other known plant r-gene classes include extracellular lrrs anchored by transmembrane domains , extracellular lrrs linked to cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase domains , intracellular serine-threonine kinases, and proteins with a coiled-coil domain anchored to the cell membrane. blast analysis predicted numerous transcripts for these classes among the two genotype datasets.

assignment to go terms related to defense and blast2go annotation  provide a further level for mining candidate genes involved in host defense responses, complementing blast nr-derived annotation. for example, a number of interesting unigenes in pathogen-inoculated calcutta  <dig> leaf tissues were identified. these include glucan synthase components, which are associated with callose deposition in host cell walls during defense response, rpm <dig> interacting protein  <dig>  reported in plant defense involving r proteins rpm <dig> and rps <dig>  mac perforin domain-containing proteins, which are associated with the salicylic acid -mediated pathway of programmed cell death, brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase  <dig>  which is involved in pti and programmed cell death, and mlo-like protein  <dig>  known to be involved in plant defense and cell wall strengthening.

quantitative real-time pcr analysis of gene expression
receptor-like protein kinases  are transmembrane proteins with an n-terminal signal sequence, a specific receptor extracellular domain, and an intracellular c-terminal kinase domain. with over  <dig> rlks characterized in arabidopsis <cit> , only few are known to be involved in plant immunity  <cit> . expression of lrr receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase rga genes was evaluated in calcutta  <dig>  following alignment of  <dig> transcriptome data to annotated bac sequences and specific primer design for mapped expressed genes. quantitative real-time pcr revealed no significant change in expression in the three selected rgas in relation to basal expression in non-inoculated controls . although constant transcript levels during pathogen attack have been reported for different classes of host receptor r genes, where constitutive expression may mediate pathogen recognition and activation of signal transduction and defence responses, upregulation has been demonstrated in certain pathosystems in response to infection  <cit> . expression analysis of potential host defence-related genes modulated during interaction with m. musicola was also conducted on randomly selected ssr-containing unigenes in calcutta  <dig> . both genes were downregulated following pathogen challenge over the timecourse , with abundance of raw est counts for each of the examined genes in inoculated and non-inoculated controls reflecting the changes observed with qrt-pcr data.

the overlaying of the  <dig> transcripts identified in the m. acuminata – m. musicola interaction onto gene models on the m. acuminata dh pahang reference genome will facilitate ongoing validation of candidate gene expression via qrt-pcr. an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms by which r genes and downstream defence mechanisms function in musa is necessary for development of novel strategies for durable resistance.

data mining against m. fijiensis gene models
data mining for m. musicola pathogen transcripts amongst the pre-processed  <dig> sequence data derived from infected leaves was performed through genome mapping and alignment against the mycosphaerella fijiensis v <dig>  all gene models  database. based upon rdna its sequence analysis, this species forms a monophyletic group with m. musicola <cit> . although pathogen transcript abundance is likely dependent on  <dig> depth of sequencing, a total of  <dig> unigenes from transcripts in pathogen-infected calcutta  <dig> and  <dig> in cavendish grande naine mapped to m. fijiensis gene models . in addition to hypothetical proteins and no hits which were identified in both c <dig> and cav, potential pathogen genes identified in transcriptome data for cavi included a sap family cell cycle dependent phosphatase-associated protein, two hsp <dig> family proteins, a fad binding domain protein, and a calcium channel. in the case of c4i data, positively mapped m. fijiensis gene models also included an extracellular protein  <dig> , and two 60s ribosomal proteins.

a total of seven ecps have been identified in cladosporium fulvum , which are secreted during interaction with tomato  <cit> . the c. fulvum effector protein ecp <dig>  crucial for virulence, contains carbohydrate-binding lysin  domains that may be involved in binding to chitin released from fungal cell walls during the infection process  <cit> . such pamp-binding may prevent induction of plant basal defense responses. orthologs of ecp <dig> have been identified in est and whole genome sequence data in a number of fungal genera. within the genus mycosphaerella, lysm-containing ecp6-like proteins have been identified in m. fijiensis <cit>  and mycosphaerella graminicola <cit> , indicating their likely presence in other members of the genus. whilst homologues of the c. fulvum ecp <dig> effectors have been described in m. fijiensis transcripts from in vitro culture  <cit> , to date there have been no reports of in vivo ecp effector homolog expression for the mycosphaerella banana pathogens during host-pathogen interaction. our identification of ecp <dig> effector protein homolog transcripts in m. musicola may contribute towards identification of pathogen effectors and cognate disease resistance genes in musa.

genic ssr markers
microsatellite markers or simple sequence repeats  are defined as tandem dna repeats which are dispersed in both coding and non-coding regions along eukaryotic genomes. as molecular markers, they are typically somatically stable, polymorphic, co-dominant, and multi-allelic. applications in musa have focused on taxonomy , genotyping , and genetic map saturation . gene-derived ssrs can be associated with functional genetic variation, as opposed to non-coding ssrs, with presence in transcribed regions potentially influencing gene function, transcription or translation  <cit> . consequently they offer potential for marker assisted breeding, with markers either originating from a gene for a desirable phenotypic trait, or co-localizing with a particular quantitative trait locus. with such markers isolated from coding regions, conservation is also potentially greater, increasing transferability to related species . in comparison with other crops, relatively few ssr markers have been developed for the genus musa, reflecting the limited sequence resources available until recently. whilst the majority have been isolated from genomic libraries or bac clones  <cit> , only few gene-derived ssrs have been characterized .

we screened the calcutta  <dig> and cavendish grande naine unigene datasets for the presence of ssr motifs. a total of  <dig>  potentially pcr amplifiable genic-ssr loci were identified in the  <dig>  calcutta  <dig> consensus sequences, representing an est-ssr frequency of  <dig> %. similar numbers were observed for the  <dig>  cavendish grande naine consensi, with a total of  <dig>  ssrs, representing a frequency of  <dig> %. in terms of ssr class distribution, for calcutta  <dig> unigenes, trinucleotide repeats were the most abundant , followed by di- , tetra- , hexa-  and penta-nucleotide repeats . hepta-nucleotide repeats and above accounted for  <dig> %. a similar distribution was observed in cavendish grande naine unigenes, with trinucleotide core motifs representing  <dig> % of repeats, followed by dinucleotides , tetra- , hexa-  and pentanucleotides . again, heptanucleotide repeats and longer ssrs made up only  <dig> % of the total. a predominance of trinucleotides in transcriptome sequence data is common  <cit> , with the presence of such motifs in gene regions avoiding frameshift mutation introduction and changes at the protein level. as expected, the shorter the nucleotide core sequence, the greater the number of repeats present. for calcutta  <dig> an average of  <dig>  repeats were observed for di-nucleotide motifs,  <dig>  for tri,  <dig>  for tetra,  <dig>  for penta, and  <dig>  for hexa-motifs. similarly for cavendish grande naine there were an average of  <dig>  repeats for di-,  <dig>  for tri-,  <dig>  for tetra-,  <dig>  for penta-, and  <dig>  for hexa- motifs. motif frequency distribution for trinucleotide and dinucleotide core motifs, which were the most abundant repeats for both genotypes are shown in figure  <dig> 

the details of all  <dig>  m. acuminata genic-ssr primers, including ssr motif, primer sequences, pcr amplification information, predicted gene function and in silico expression data are provided in additional file  <dig>  a subset of  <dig> potential defense-related gene-derived ssr loci, selected on the basis of blast similarities and kog descriptors, were validated for specific amplification and polymorphism across  <dig> diploid m. acuminata accessions, to complement previous work by our group  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  amplified specific products of expected size from genomic dna originating from the tested m. acuminata genotypes. polymorphism was observed in  <dig> loci , with alleles per polymorphic locus ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and a total of  <dig> alleles scored across the polymorphic loci. polymorphism information content ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig>  . this limited diversity can be expected for genic-ssr markers, as a result of dna sequence conservation of transcribed regions  <cit> .

polymorphism was evaluated across 21 m. acuminata accessions. he, expected heterozygosity under hardy-weinberg expectations; ho, observed heterozygosity; pic, polymorphism information content.

our work represents a large scale development of new genic-ssr markers for application in genetic improvement, complementing the approximately  <dig>  ssrs identified in bac-end and sequence scaffolds of dh-pahang  <cit> . with efforts underway towards development of segregant populations for traits of interest  <cit> , these functional gene-based markers are applicable for association to trait loci and downstream marker-assisted selection, as well as evolution analysis, parentage assessment and general genotyping applications in breeding programs.

CONCLUSIONS
this ngs-based investigation of the transcriptome in the m. acuminata – m. musicola interaction provides useful data on expressed genes during plant immune responses in this pathosystem, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigene sets identified, respectively, for contrasting m. acuminata genotypes calcutta  <dig> and cavendish grande naine. genes were characterized according to blast annotation, go category assignment and interpro-based domain identification. the data represent a global transcriptome level resource for m. acuminata, with identification of candidate genes expressed during infection contributing to our understanding of host defense mechanisms against this important pathogen. the recently published reference whole genome for dh-pahang represents approximately 90% of the estimated genome size. genome annotation updates will be facilitated by the availability and mapping of comprehensive sets of expressed gene sequences for this species. our large scale characterization of genic-ssrs and marker development are a resource for application in genetic map enrichment, diversity characterization and downstream marker assisted breeding in musa.
