BACKGROUND
sunflower  is an important oil crop and ornamental plant that is also considered an efficient source of biodiesel  <cit> . because sunflowers have the characteristics of drought resistance and strong salinity tolerance, these plants have been widely planted throughout the world. however, with the gradual expansion of the sunflower planting area, diseases also occur. in particular, the worldwide spreads of sunflower verticillium wilt  has become the main disease currently affecting sunflower production. svw, a serious soil-borne vascular disease is caused by verticillium dahliae  <cit> , which is harmful to more than  <dig> plant species worldwide  <cit> . this disease causes sunflower leaves to become yellow or withered, followed by the eventual death of seriously infected plants .fig.  <dig> symptoms and dynamics of the main physiological indexes in inoculated resistant genotype  and susceptible genotype . a symptoms of the resistant and susceptible genotypes  <dig> d after v. dahliae inoculation. b dynamics of the main physiological indexes in the inoculated resistant and susceptible genotypes at different time points after inoculation. i soluble protein, ii pod




in recent years, efforts had been made in discovering the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between v. dahliae and arabidopsis, tomato, potato, and cotton plants, and several resistance-related genes and enzymes have been well characterized . in the interaction between arabidopsis thaliana and verticillium wilt, pantelides reported enhanced resistance in etr1- <dig>  plants, indicating a crucial role for etr <dig> in defense against this pathogen, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that the impaired perception of et via etr <dig> results in increased disease resistance  <cit> . in a previous study, yao showed that no may act as an upstream signaling molecule to trigger the deploymerization of cortical microtubules in arabidopsis  <cit> . in  <dig>  a study showed that ve chimeras in which the first thirty elrrs of ve <dig> were replaced with those of ve <dig> retain the ability to induce hr, and the ve <dig> gene of tomato confers resistance against race  <dig> strains of v. dahliae and v. albo-atrum  <cit> . song, y et al. suggested an ancient origin of the ve <dig> immune receptor in the plant kingdom  <cit> . in  <dig>  rna-seq analysis showed that disease defense genes were expressed at much higher levers in the tomatoes grown with potato or onion plants than in tomato plants grown alone  <cit> . furthermore, some studies have speculated that a mir482-mediated silencing cascade is involved in the regulation of potato resistance against v. dahliae infection and in the counter defense action of plants in response to pathogen infection  <cit> . in studies on cotton responses to v. dahliae, sun et al. used the rna-seq method to identify  <dig> differentially expressed genes involved in cotton defense responses  <cit> . using the same method, a total of  <dig> unigenes were determined as be homologous to known defense-related genes in other plants  <cit> .

no fungicides are available to cure infected commercial sunflowers. thus, resistance breeding is the most ideal strategy for controlling plant pathogenic fungus with great benefit of economy and environmental protection. in the present study, we used rna-seq to discuss and compare the transcriptome profile in the roots of resistant and susceptible sunflower genotypes under v. dahliae infection. different pairwise transcriptome comparisons were made over a time course . a comparison of the uninoculated resistant genotype with the uninoculated susceptible genotype showed a basal gene expression pattern. genotype-common and genotype-specific transcriptional changes in response to v. dahliae inoculation were further identified. the potential roles for degs were researched, and the resistance mechanism of sunflower against v. dahliae was also discussed. these finding will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular interactions between sunflower and v. dahlia for resistance breeding and provide insight into the interactions between plants and pathogens.

RESULTS
study of the main physiological indexes in sunflower roots post-inoculation
two sunflower genotypes, previously classified as resistant  and susceptible  to sunflower verticillium wilt  according to their field behavior, were used in this study . to investigate the process of svw colonization,  <dig> indexes , and malondialdehyde ) were measured at  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h, and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 10 days post inoculation for the two sunflower genotypes. after infection with v. dahliae, the content of soluble protein initially increases, but then decrease thereafter, and the contents peaked from  <dig> to 12 h when treatment was prolonged. the physiological index in the resistant genotype was significantly higher than that in the susceptible genotype at  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h and  <dig> d. however, in the resistant genotype, the physiological index was lower than that in the susceptible genotype at  <dig> and  <dig> d, and this reversed at  <dig> d . the pod activity in the resistant genotype was higher at  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> d compared with the susceptible genotype . for mda measurement, the content was slightly higher in the susceptible genotype than in the resistant genotype at the four initial time points . based on the above discussion of the physiological indexes, we concluded that the resistant genotype performed better in resistance to v. dahliae infection. to further identify the resistance-related genes, a rna-seq experiment for all time points examined above was proposed in the following study.

illumina sequencing and de novo assembly
in the present study, we performed transcriptome analysis of  <dig> samples  to describe the sunflower root response to svw, and  <dig> , <dig> reads were sequenced for library establishment. the length of most of the reads were distributed between  <dig> and 175 bp. thus, we used the short reads comparison software tmap  <cit>  to compare reads with the reference gene sequences , obtaining a total of  <dig> , <dig> mapped reads  . moreover, we obtained a total of  <dig>  unigenes, with a mean length of 890 bp. the size distribution showed that  <dig>   unigenes ranged in size from  <dig> to 500 bp,  <dig>   unigenes ranged in size from  <dig> to 1000 bp, and  <dig> % unigenes showed sizes greater than 1000 bp.fig.  <dig> comparison of resistant genotype  and susceptible genotype  in response to v. dahliae inoculation. a scatter plot of differentially expressed genes  in the uninoculated resistant genotype  and susceptible genotype . b pca3d figure, each dot represents a sample on the principal component value. c hierarchical clustering of  <dig> degs; the signal ratios are shown in a yellow-blue color, where yellow represents up-regulation and blue represents down-regulation. each column  represents the rpkm value in each sample and each row represents degs. s and p: s <dig> and p77; ck: the genotype exempt from pathogen stress as control; 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 2d, 3d, 5d, and 10d: resistant genotype  and susceptible genotype  infected with v. dahliae after  <dig>   <dig>  24 h and  <dig>   <dig>  10 days respectively




the expression level for each gene was calculated using the rpkm  <cit>  method . the related information for each gene  was also provided. to gain insight into the functions of the genes with responses to svw, all unigenes were annotated using wego  <cit>  and blast2go  <cit>  software and were classified into functional categories. kegg pathway significant enrichment analyses were also performed for all genes. specific expression analysis  <cit>  was also used in the present study . scatter plot, principal component and cluster analyses were also used to mine the deep relation of different samples . these results revealed a large difference between the resistant and susceptible genotypes.

inter-genotypes differences in basal gene expression
the uninoculated resistant  and susceptible  genotypes were further compared to analyze the basal gene expression pattern . differential expression analysis revealed  <dig> significantly degs based on the false discovery rate value  < =  <dig>  and the absolute value of fold-change  > =  <dig> . moreover, among all degs,  <dig> genes had a much higher expression value for the resistant genotype, with rpkms ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  and a total of  <dig> genes had a much higher expression value for the susceptible genotype, with rpkms ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  in particular,  <dig> genes were expressed at low level in the susceptible genotype , but they had a higher expression value in the resistant genotype . as inter-genotype differences may reveal the mechanisms of disease resistance and susceptibility  <cit> , we also classified these degs according to functional categories. following the nr annotations, the degs were mapped into three go categories, including  <dig> sub-categories . moreover, kegg analyses were performed to identify the basal level biological pathways in sunflower roots. all degs were enriched into  <dig> kegg pathways. moreover,  <dig> important pathways were obtained with p values < = <dig>  .

transcriptional changes in response to v. dahliae inoculation
after the multiple comparisons , two criteria of degs were defined: |fc value| > =  <dig> with p-value < =  <dig> , and fdr < =  <dig>   <cit> . the results of the differential comparison between control and inoculated samples are shown in the rd and sd datasets . the  <dig> datasets represented the degs in response to svw for each genotype. the comparison results between two inoculated samples for resistant and susceptible genotypes at same time point is shown in the d datasets, representing the degs between resistant and susceptible genotypes in response to svw infection .

the dynamic changes with time of the degs in rd, sd and d datasets were also investigated . the results showed that the remarkable changes in the transcriptome profile occurred on day  <dig>  the number of degs in the d datasets, including both total and up-regulated degs, was markedly more than those in other two datasets at the first three time points. for the rd datasets , the numbers of degs was much more than that in the sd datasets at the last three time points . in contrast, the numbers of degs in the sd datasets have relatively fewer changes than the other two datasets at the last three time points .

further, time-common degs and time-specific degs were examined . the common degs between neighboring time points were defined as time-common degs. the specific degs for their own datasets were defined as time-specific degs. the time-common degs showed more overlap in the datasets of 2– <dig> d in rd and 24 h- <dig> d in sd . for d datasets, the time-common degs were more common in neighboring data than in the rd and sd datasets . and, fig. 3ii, iv and vi show the trend of time-specific degs.fig.  <dig> the distribution of degs between neighboring datasets. the numbers of degs exclusively regulated in each dataset are shown in the circle. the numbers of the time-common degs are shown in the overlapping regions. the time-specific degs are shown in the remaining regions. a and b represented degs of the rd and sd datasets; c represented degs of d datasets. i, iii, and v represented change of the time-common degs; ii, iv and vi represented the change of the time-specific transcription




genotype-common transcriptional changes in response to v. dahliae inoculation
for the time-common degs, the property of the genes between rd and sd datasets was also investigated. a total of  <dig> co-expressed degs were defined as genotype-common transcriptional degs . the functional categories of the largest percentages of the common genes were related to ‘metabolic process’  and ‘cellular process’ , followed by ‘disease resistance’  . among these disease resistance categories, the cluster ‘response to stress’  represented the largest group, followed by ‘oxidation reduction’ ; ‘secondary metabolic process’ ; and ‘immune response’ . others disease resistance categories, such as ‘hormone metabolic process’ , ‘positive regulation of immune system process’ , ‘regulation of response to stimulus’ and ‘cell wall biogenesis’ , were also studied .fig.  <dig> genotype-common or genotype-specific transcriptional changes in degs in the resistant genotype  and the susceptible genotype . a distribution of genotype-common transcriptional degs, modulated in rd and sd datasets into functional categories. b distribution of genotype-common transcriptional degs, modulated in d datasets into functional categories. c distribution of the genes involved in disease resistance, modulated in both genotypes into functional categories. d the dynamic trends of two degs involved in disease resistance. e  <dig> genotype-specific transcriptional degs encoded peroxidase  in s <dig>   <dig> genotype-specific transcriptional degs encoded peroxidase  in p <dig>  the left side of the red line represents variations in the average fold-changes in genotype-specific transcriptional degs in s <dig>  while the right side of the red line represents that in p77




the  <dig> time-common degs in the d datasets were also co-expressed in both genotypes and were also observed as degs with genotype-common transcriptional pattern . the functional categories of the largest percentages of the common genes were related to ‘metabolic process’  and ‘cellular process’ , followed by ‘disease resistance’ , which included the categories: ‘response to stress’ ; ‘oxidation reduction’ ; ‘secondary metabolic process’ ; and ‘immune response’ . other disease resistance categories were also observed following detailed analysis .

after analyzing the genotype-common transcriptional pattern,  <dig> genes related to svw resistance were observed in the rd-vs-sd and d datasets . the genes encoding to peroxidase , glutathione peroxidase, aquaporin pip, chitinase, l-ascorbate oxidase, and lrr receptors were identified using go enrichment . for example, unigene_ <dig>  which encoded peroxidase, showed higher fcs at different time points in the resistant genotype. the inverse result was observed for gene cl <dig>  which encoded l-ascorbate oxidase . when we focused on the average fold-change of each deg for each functional category in genotype-common degs, most of the up-regulated degs in the resistant genotype showed a higher average fc than the susceptible genotype, and several down-regulated degs in the resistant genotype displayed lower average fcs than the susceptible genotype .

genotype-specific transcriptional changes in response to v. dahliae inoculation
certain time-common degs were unique to the resistant  or susceptible  genotypes and were defined as genotype-specific transcriptional degs. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> degs were observed as genotype-specific transcriptional degs in resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively . the functional enrichment of degs showed that the largest percentages of the genes were related to ‘metabolic process’  and ‘cellular process’ , followed by genes involved in ‘disease resistance’  . among these disease resistance categories in the resistant and susceptible genotypes, most of the degs were involved in the cluster ‘response to stress’ ; followed by ‘oxidation reduction’ ; secondary metabolic process’ ; and ‘immune response’ . we concluded that the resistant genotype expressed more disease-resistance genes than the susceptible genotype .

analysis of the genotype-specific transcriptional pattern revealed  <dig> and  <dig> genes directly related to svw resistance in the resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively . transcripts related to peroxidase , l-ascorbate oxidase, aquaporin pip, lrr receptor-like serine and the proto-oncogene protein myb were identified using go enrichment. a total of  <dig> genotype-specific transcriptional degs encoding peroxidase  were identified in the resistant genotype, while only  <dig> degs were identified in the susceptible genotype. remarkably, for up-regulated genotype-specific degs in the resistant genotype, a higher average fc was observed in the resistant genotype than in the susceptible genotype . the down-regulated genotype-specific degs in the resistant genotype showed a lower average fc . similar results were observed in genotype-specific transcriptional degs encoding l-ascorbate oxidase, aquaporin pip, lrr receptor-like serine kinase and the myb proto-oncogene protein . however, no similar pattern was observed in the susceptible genotype . this conclusion was consistent with the results of the analysis of pod physiological indexes in sunflower roots post inoculation .

validation of rna-seq data by quantitative real-time pcr
to validate the rna-seq expression profiles of degs, the quantitative real-time pcr  of three independent replicatates was performed. a total of  <dig> degs were randomly selected from the comparison between the uninoculated resistant and susceptible genotypes to validate the rna-seq expression profiles, and  <dig> degs detected using qpcr were consistent with the rna-seq data . further, we randomly selected  <dig> degs from rd and sd datasets . for rd datasets,  <dig> %  of the qpcr results were consistent with the rna-seq data . for sd datasets,  <dig> %  of the qpcr results were consistent with the rna-seq data .fig.  <dig> comparison of rna-seq and the quantitative real-time pcr analyses for gene expression validation. the up arrow indicates the up-regulation of degs, the down arrow indicates the down-regulation of degs. rn indicates rna-seq, rt indicates qpcr. a comparison of rna-seq and qpcr analyses for the genes expression validation in rd datasets. b the expression validation of degs  using qpcr




generally, most of the genes assayed in the inoculated resistant genotype showed higher expression levels, and they were further analyzed by rna-seq and confirmed using qpcr, consistent with results of studies of the major physiological indexes in sunflower roots post inoculation .

identification of novel v. dahliae inoculation-responsive genes
by analyzing the inter-genotype differences in basal gene expression, genotype-common transcriptional changes and genotype-specific transcriptional changes in response to v. dahlia inoculation, showed  <dig> degs , which were related to svw resistance. the results of cluster analysis for the degs showed that the expression patterns of the degs significantly varied in response to v. dahliae in both genotypes at different time points. generally, similar expression patterns were observed among adjacent time point samples in the same genotype. in both resistant and susceptible genotypes, the samples possessed more up-regulated genes 2 days after inoculation. interestingly, some degs were up-regulated in the resistant genotype and down-regulated in susceptible genotype, while other degs showed the opposite result .

interestingly, in the interaction mechanism of verticillium wilt and sunflower, for  <dig> degs, kegg enrichment analyses were performed to identify the biological pathways in sunflower root. the results showed that  <dig> unigenes involved in kegg pathway related to plant-pathogen interaction, which regulate  <dig> crucial points ;  <dig> degs were involved in kegg pathway related to plant hormone signal transduction, which regulate  <dig> crucial proteins ;  <dig> degs were associated with kegg pathway related to flavonoid biosynthesis, which regulate  <dig> critical points ; and  <dig> degs were involved in the kegg pathway related to benzoxazinoid biosynthesis .

based on plant-pathogen interaction pathway, we observed that the hyper-sensitive response  was regulated through the reactive oxygen species  and oxide  signaling pathways. respiratory burst oxidase homolog  and flagellin-sensitive  <dig>  could activated ros. cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel  could mediate the no signaling pathway . in the present study, three genes  encoding rboh were up-regulated  in both genotypes, based on the comparison between treated and untreated sunflower genotypes. notably, the expression levels of the genes in the resistant genotype were highly increased by comparing with those in susceptible genotype after pathogen challenge. however, most of the genes encoding fls <dig> were down-regulated in both the resistant or susceptible genotypes after inoculation, and the expression levels of the genes in the resistant genotype were highly decreased by comparing with those in the susceptible genotype. perhaps to compensate for the loss, the expression levels of three genes in the resistance genotype were more increased. furthermore, the results showed that the genes encoding cngc were down-regulated or up-regulated in both genotypes after the infection. however, expression levels of some of genes were more enhanced in the resistant genotype. remarkably, four genes encoding cngc were up-regulated in the resistant genotype, but were down-regulated in the susceptible genotype . in plant hormone signal transduction pathway, the dissociation between jaz  and the transcription factor myc <dig> could induce defense-related genes, and was initiated by jasmonic acid . this dissociation could be activated by coi <dig> . in this study, the genes  related to coi <dig> were promoted in the resistant genotype, but were enhanced in the susceptible sunflower genotype when compared treated with untreated sunflowers. four genes encoding jaz were up-regulated in the susceptible sunflower genotype, but two genes  were down-regulated in the resistant sunflower genotype. for the salicylic acid -mediated signal transduction pathway, to induce the expression of defense genes, such as the pathogenesis-related gene pr- <dig> , npr <dig> must activate the activity of transcription factor tga. in the present study, unigene28388_all, which encoded npr <dig>  was up-regulated in the resistant sunflower genotype, but were down-regulated in the susceptible sunflower genotype. four genes encoding tga were up-regulated in the resistance sunflower genotype. notably, the expression levels of the genes in the resistant genotype were remarkably increased when comparing them with those in the susceptible genotype .

furthermore, we identified  <dig> aba -related genes, among which  <dig> genes were up-regulated in the resistant genotype compared with the susceptible genotype, and  <dig> degs showed distinct down-regulation in the resistant genotype compared with the susceptible genotype. in addition, we identified  <dig> ja-related genes and  <dig> et-related genes . all these genes were well represented in both genotypes and a higher average fc in the resistant genotype than in the susceptible genotype was observed for many of the up-regulated genes, while a lower average fc in the resistant genotype than in the susceptible genotype was observed for many of the down-regulated genes , confirming the results of genotype-specific transcriptional pattern analysis . in particular, these down-regulated genes may regulate important signaling pathway. this conclusion was consistent with the research results of sun et al., revealing that the down-regulation of ghcyp82d might regulate the ja signaling pathway  <cit> .fig.  <dig> distribution of differentially expressed genes specific to the resistant genotype and the susceptible genotype in response to v. dahlia infection. each square represents the fold-change of one gene in the resistant  or susceptible  genotypes, where red represents up-regulation and deep blue represents down-regulation




discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
plants adapt to complex environments by defending themselves against a wide range of pathogens that have different lifestyles  <cit> . to reveal how plants resist infections, rna-seq was used in the present study. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were obtained. we focused on the genes associated with disease resistance. previous studies have shown that peroxidases, aquaporins and chitin, which are widely distributed in the plant kingdom , are activated in defense responses against pathogens . in addition, ascorbate oxidase  is a potential conductor of a symphony of signaling pathways  <cit> , ao over expression or suppression was apparently influenced under unfavorable environmental conditions . several studies on lrr disease resistance proteins confirmed an association with plant resistance to fungal diseases  <cit> . in present study, we analyzed the genotype-common transcriptional pattern, identifying  <dig> genes related to svw resistance in the rd-vs-sd and d datasets; analysis of the genotype-specific transcriptional pattern, showed  <dig> and  <dig> genes directly related to svw resistance in the resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively. furthermore, the transcripts were analyzed using go  classification analysis. most of the genes were related to peroxidase , glutathione peroxidase, aquaporin pip, chitinase, l-ascorbate oxidase, and lrr receptors. remarkably, for up-regulated genotype-specific degs in the resistant genotype, a higher average fc in the resistant genotype was observed compared with the susceptible genotype and the inverse was observed in down-regulated genotype-specific degs in the resistant genotype. this conclusion indirectly confirmed the results of the study on the main physiological indexes in sunflower roots.

for resistance to v. dahlia infection, sunflowers induce the hr and cell wall reinforcement. the hr is activated through ros, ja, wrkys and the no signaling pathway  <cit>  and is mediated by cngc, rboh, cam/cml and fls <dig> . in the present study, the comparison between treated and untreated sunflower genotypes showed that most of the genes encoding rboh and cngc were up-regulated in the both genotypes, and most of the genes encoding fls <dig> were down-regulated in both genotypes. furthermore, the expression levels of up-regulated genes were more highly increased and expression levels of the down-regulated genes were more highly decreased in the resistance genotype.

in plants facing pathogen infection, a variety of hormonal signaling pathways involved in defense against all types of challenges were induced . jasmonates and sa are essential phytohormones for plant development and survival, and play an important role in plant resistance to fungal diseases  <cit> . coi <dig> is a key component of the ja-mediated signal transduction pathway, leading to the dissociation between jaz and the transcription factor myc <dig>  which could induce defense-related genes. for the sa-mediated signal transduction pathway, npr <dig> plays a critical role in the induction of defense genes by activating the transcription factor tga  <cit> . in the present study, the genes encoding jaz were up-regulated in the susceptible sunflower genotype, but two of these genes were down-regulated in the resistant sunflower genotype. the coi <dig> and npr <dig> and tga genes were promoted in the resistant genotype but repressed in the susceptible sunflower genotype when comparing treated and untreated sunflower. furthermore, the expression levels of the genes in the resistant genotype were remarkably increased compared with those in the susceptible genotype.

furthermore, because sunflower has a large genome, studies have not previously elucidated any comprehensive sequence information to describe the transcriptome associated with defense responses against v. dahliae. here, an rna-seq approach was employed to investigate the molecular interaction between sunflower and v. dahliae. the results showed that some of the genes related to svw resistance involved in the plant-pathogen interactions and plant hormone signal transduction, flavonoid biosynthesis and benzoxazinoid biosynthesis pathways, which will strongly contribute to a better understanding of the molecular interactions between sunflower and v. dahliae and provide insights into the interaction between plants and pathogens. accordingly, the findings of the present study will accelerate research on the resistance of sunflower to v. dahliae and contribute to a better understanding of the sunflower defense response to plant pathogens.
