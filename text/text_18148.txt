BACKGROUND
avian infectious bronchitis  is an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens, causes major economic losses in poultry industry worldwide  <cit> . the ib virus  is a member of gammacoronavirus genus, previously group  <dig>  within the coronaviridae and it is the type species of the avian coronavirus of the domestic chicken )  <cit> .

it is generally accepted that chickens are the most important natural host of ibv and epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract are the primary target, and intensive virus replication, predominantly in the trachea, results in respiratory signs, which are the most frequent clinical manifestation of this disease  <cit> .

chickens of all ages are susceptible, but the severity is great in younger ages  <cit> , and the clinical signs include depression, coughing, dyspnea, sneezing, nasal discharge, and death  <cit> . however, some strains of ibv can also replicates in the ciliated epithelial cells of organs, such as the kidney, reproductive and enteric tracts, producing severe nephritis, reproductive disorders in males and females, a drop in egg production and quality in laying flocks and deep pectoral myopathy in broiler breeder may occure  <cit> .

the transmission of ibv is mainly horizontal by direct contact via the respiratory tract from infected chickens. infection takes place via inhalation of droplets containing the air born virus. or indirect by contaminated feed and drinking water, including human beings, probably contribute to more local spread  <cit> . in addition, it has been demonstrate that certain strains of ibv may persist in small amounts in the cecal tonsils of the intestinal tract by asymptomatic way during long time  <cit> .

ibv is an enveloped, non segmented, positive sense, single stranded rna virus. its genome consists of about  <dig>  kb and codes for four structural proteins: the membrane , small membrane , nucleoprotein  and spike   <cit> . the multimeric coiled-coil s protein is post-translationally cleaved into smaller proteins namely s <dig> and s <dig>  <cit> . the s <dig> gene contains the hypervariable regions that are responsible for the induction of neutralizing, serotype specific antibodies and protective immunity  <cit> . many ibv genotypes and serotypes have been identified and have complicated efforts at control through vaccination, due to the frequent point mutations in s <dig> gene that can be partially or poorly neutralised by existing vaccine serotypes  <cit> . for this reason, the sequencing of this gene is the most useful strategy for the molecular characterization of virus isolates existing in the field and the selection of appropriate vaccines  <cit> .

in morocco, ibv was identified for the first time in  <dig> by el houadfi & jones  <cit> . subsequently, several reports confirmed the ibv strains related to the massachusetts and to 4/ <dig> genotypes  <cit> .

recently, between 2010- <dig>  an epidemiological survey showed the emergence of a novel strain of italy <dig> serotype with a prevalence of 32 %, co-circulating with two serotypes; massachusetts and 4/ <dig>  with a prevalence of 66 % and 2 % respectively, that are isolated from vaccinated and unvaccinated chicken flocks  <cit> .

mass vaccination in morocco is conducted using a vaccine against massachusetts, which is the most dominant serotype, however no information about pathogenesis and tissue distribution of italy  <dig> serotype, hence the objective of this present study which is reported for the first time in morocco, aims to evaluate the pathogenicity and the tissue distribution of the three isolated moroccan strains of ibv italy  <dig> genotype in one day old experimentally infected spf chickens. the clinical signs, tracheal ciliary activity, gross and microscopic lesions were evaluated. serological response by the detection of ibv antibodies of the affected chicks was also checked. re-isolation of the virus from the affected organs and rt-pcr test was used to detect virus in several tissues of infected birds.

RESULTS
clinical signs and gross pathological findings
clinical monitoring of infected chicks reveals at first, apparent respiratory symptoms beginning at day  <dig> post-inoculation . respiratory clinical signs were predominant in all of the inoculated groups and were intense and more severe until  <dig> dpi, with no clear differences in the pathogenicity of the three strains. the most prominent clinical signs were characterized by gasping, depression, sneezing, difficulty in breathing, cough, pulmonary and tracheal rales, with high scores were reported for all the tested strains with clinical score of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for ibv/ra, ibv/mn and ibv/tu strain respectively, .table  <dig> clinical signs scores of spf chickens inoculated with ibv strains ibv/mnibv infectious bronchitis virus

nasal discharge and watery eyes were also observed but were transient in some of infected by ibv/ra and ibv/mn chicks. these clinical symptoms were persisted in all groups until 12dpi. the birds infected by ibv/mn and ibv/tu appeared lethargic, reluctant to move , whereas, chicks infected with by ibv/ra were not as apathetic. at autopsy, all infected chicks that were killed at  <dig> dpi to prevent their suffering were examined for the macroscopic lesions in the trachea, lung and kidney. these gross lesions consisted in hemorrhagic tracheitis, mucosal congestion and catarrhal exudates that mainly progressed. for the three strains used, the signs were observed in the most infected chicks with dominance in the lungs that were hemorrhagic and sometimes cyanotic at one lobe. therefore, samples were taken at  <dig> dpi just for a macroscopic examination of organs to confirm whether the absence of clinical signs is correlative with the gross lesions. whereas, gross lesions of kidney, were not observed in all inoculated chicks. during the experiment, the non-infected control group stayed normally without clinical signs or gross lesions. the statistical analysis was not performed as the three tested strains are phylogentically related to each other and the difference in clinical and tissues scores is not very significant.fig.  <dig> birds lethargic and reluctant to move after infection with ibv/mn strain  and with ibv/tu strain 



histopathological examination
the microscopic tissues analysis was performed in the euthanized chicks at  <dig> dpi. this period correlates with the maximum intensity of clinical signs . these signs fade from the 7dpi with a total restoration at  <dig> dpi, that why we only conducted the macroscopic examination at this time. histopathological lesions developed at 5dpi in the three groups of experimentally infected chickens, were compatible of those previously described for infectious bronchitis virus  <cit> . and their scoring was mainly correlating with the ranking and scoring described in previous experiments  <cit> .

in the trachea, most detected lesions in all infected groups were characterized by mucosal thickening, hyperplasia of the surface epithelium, loss of cilia, and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate  of lamina propria . mean total score of severity was  <dig> ;  <dig>  and  <dig>  in birds infected by ibv/mn; ibv/ra and ibv/14/tu strains respectively. this indicates that ibv/tu strain seems to have a higher degree of pathogenicity than the other tested strains .fig.  <dig>

in the lungs, lesions in all infected groups were mainly confined to the primary and secondary bronchi and included epithelial hyperplasia, loss of cilia, and heterophils and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate  of the lamina propria and peribronchial space . other changes were located in the atria and parabronchi and consisted of hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of pneumocytes. the score of these changes were from mild to moderate degree of severity and there was no big differences in the mean total score of severity among tissues infected with the  <dig> tested ibv strains , thus indicating no differences in the pathogenicity of the three strains for the lung . however, no kidney lesions were observed in chicks infected with the three tested strains. tracheas and lungs of control chicks samples throughout the experiment, showed normal histological features.fig.  <dig>

ciliostasis: tracheal ciliary activity
ciliary activity was observed in all tracheas of infected birds at 5dpi. but the severity differed between the three strains tested; the ciliostasi caused by ibv/mn and ibv/ra strains was 25 % and 50 % for ibv/tu strain, compared to the control group . however, a partial recovery of ciliary activity in infected birds was observed at 12dpi.

viral re- isolation
results related to ibv distribution was checked in all tissues samples collected at 5dpi of all infected chicks. the virus was found in the trachea, lung of all strains, but in the kidney of one strain  with low viral load. the effect of the virus after one passage in spf  <dig> old embryonated eggs showed dwarfism and hemorrhagic spots in all over the body of the embryo, which are considered pathognomonic signs of ibv .fig.  <dig> dwarfism and hemorrhage of embryos after re-isolation of the virus from experimentally infected chicks  in comparison with the control 



the virus was re-isolated from all the sampled tissues with a high viral load in the trachea and lungs. no ib virus was re-isolated from the control group. real time rt-pcr results obtained from the tissues of infected chicks at  <dig> dpi was closely correlating with those obtains from allantoic liquid of inoculated eggs .table  <dig> viral replication detected 5 days post infection in the respiratory and nephritic tract of experimentally infected chicksspf specific pathogen free

serological response
antibody titers against infectious bronchitis  in the serum collected from chickens of different groups on days  <dig> and  <dig> dpi was measured by elisa test. in the all infected group, serum samples were negative at day  <dig> and  <dig> dpi but antibodies titers was increased at 14dpi. serum of the control chicks was free from specific antibodies against ibv on the entire dpi.

discussion
in the present work, we have studied the pathogenesis of ibv italy  <dig> genotype which was recently detected for the first time in morocco and also in africa  <cit> . no studies on the italy <dig> genotype were reported in neighboring maghreb or other african countries. the previous study in morocco focused the mapping serotypes circulating in poultry flocks  <cit> , but no information is available about the pathogenicity and the tissue tropism of this new genotype  and protective efficacy of implemented vaccines. to do that, experimental infection in one day-old spf chickens was used to evaluate pathogenicity and tissue tropism of three moroccan italy <dig> strains .

results showed that all the three tested strains of ibv, were capable to induce respiratory signs at 48 h pi. infected chicken showed the various signs of depression, sneezing, difficulty in breathing, nasal discharge, cough, pulmonary and tracheal rales. developed symptoms became severe at  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, and persisted in some chicks until 12dpi. the birds infected by ibv/mn and ibv/tu appeared lethargic, reluctant to move compared to those infected by ibv/ra. no clinical nephritis or mortalities were recorded during the course of experiment in all groups. the clinical signs and gross lesions of this genotype are in accordance with the findings that have been described previously for other serotype of ibv  <cit> , and were in agreement with the clinical signs mentioned by purcell and mcferran  <cit> . regarding to histopathological examination of  <dig> sacrificed infected birds at 5dpi. the three ibv strains studied have the same severity of lesions in lung with no differences in the pathogenicity. but the ibv/tu strain seems to have a higher degree of pathogenicity in the trachea than others tow tested strains. clinical signs score and tracheal lesions developed in all infected birds confirm the ability of this new moroccan genotype, to induce respiratory disease and is therefore regarded as having respiratory tropism. whereas, dolz et al, demonstrated that the spanish italy <dig> serotype capable to cause severe respiratory and renal damage  <cit> . the pathogenicity and clinical sing score obtained with the three strains italy <dig> genotype were in accordance and common with those reported for most other serotype of ibv in different countries .

results of virus re-isolation confirm ibv distribution in all tissues examined at 5dpi, with the three tested strains. histopathological and gross lesions showed that the trachea is the primary site of lesions associated with ibv replication as generally reported for the ibv virus  <cit> .

in this report, elisa test used to evaluate levels of the ab to ibv in all infected groups at  <dig> and 14dpi. elisa method detected moderate levels of the ab at 14dpi. this result confirms that infected chickens seroconverted against ib, after manifestation of specific clinical sings. indeed, ghadakchi et al. showed that elisa could be reliable, repeatable, and sensitive for detecting ib antibodies  <cit> .

results obtained with moroccan italy <dig> genotype demonstrated that the three strains emerging in moroccan poultry farms have a wide distribution for respiratory system, without kidney damage and without causing mortality.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study has revealed that the chickens infected with the three tested strains showed the specific respiratory signs with high clinical signs. these infected chicks were sero-converted at  <dig> dpi and confirmed the spread of the inoculated virus. in addition, the macroscopic lesions and histopathological examination revealed specific lesions of trachea and lung, without renal manifestations. the histopathology of respiratory organs demonstrated a high lesional score of ibv/tu strain which correlate with the clinical score of  <dig>  moreover, virus re-isolation was performed successfully for all the three tested strains. results obtained with real time pcr in organs sampled from infected birds  and from fluid allantoic in the first passage in spf eggs, showed a significant abundance of the virus in the respiratory tract. in other words, the findings of molecular analysis of virus re-isolation are strongly correlated with the histopathological tests.

finally, this current report justify that italy  <dig> genotype isolated from different regions of morocco is capable to induce a severe respiratory disease with a wide distribution of respiratory system. however, this genotype do not cause any kidney damage and without causing mortality.
