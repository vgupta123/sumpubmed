BACKGROUND
horizontal gene transfer , the “non-sexual movement of genetic material between two organisms”  <cit> , is relatively common in prokaryotes  <cit>  and single-celled eukaryotes, but a number of factors combine to make it far rarer in multicellular eukaryotes  <cit> . in order for a eukaryotic species to gain a gene by hgt, foreign dna must enter the host nucleus, integrate into the genome, and in more complex organisms it must enter the sequestered germline in order to be transmitted to offspring  <cit> . once there, it must not experience strong negative selection, despite potential for genetic incompatibility with the host genome and mismatch between the niche of the donor and the host  <cit> . over the longer term, foreign dna may become “domesticated” in the recipient genome and provide novel function  <cit> .

recent estimates indicate that, although occurring at a lower frequency than in prokaryotes, hgt in eukaryotes might be less rare than previously thought  <cit> , and among metazoans there are now several well-documented cases of the horizontal transfer of single genes or small sets of genes from non-metazoan donors. for example, multiple horizontal transfer events are thought to have allowed the emergence of plant parasitism in root-knot nematodes, through the uptake of genes from bacteria used for plant cell wall degradation and modulation of plant defence  <cit> . several metazoans have also acquired the ability to synthesize carotenoids using genes of fungal origin  <cit> . despite these examples, the role of hgt in the generation of novel adaptations is often ignored when looking at the evolution of eukaryotes.

a recently discovered exception to the relatively low rate of hgt in multicellular eukaryotes was found in bdelloid rotifers. bdelloids are microscopic, aquatic animals that have experienced extensive hgt. since the initial discovery of inter-kingdom horizontally acquired genes in two species of bdelloid rotifer  <cit> , work in adineta ricciae has demonstrated that many of these genes are expressed, and 8–10 % of a. ricciae transcripts are potentially foreign  <cit> . these genes are involved in diverse metabolic pathways and can contribute to the desiccation response  <cit> , which is important for bdelloids that live in ephemeral habitats such as the water film on terrestrial mosses. the publication of the genome of a closely related species, adineta vaga  <cit> , revealed a similar level of hgt, with 8 % of predicted genes of putative foreign origin. based on the presence of these foreign genes in the same degenerate tetraploid state as observed in the rest of the genome, flot et al.  <cit>  predict that at least 20 % were incorporated into the genome of the common ancestor of extant bdelloid species. however, the frequency of inter-kingdom hgt events and their contribution to adaptation to different environments occupied by bdelloids remains to be determined.

two major features of bdelloid life-history may contribute to their unusually high number of horizontally acquired genes. first, many bdelloids are extremely tolerant of desiccation  <cit> . it has been suggested that foreign genes might be incorporated into bdelloid genomes during cycles of desiccation and rehydration, during which dna is broken and repaired . desiccation also causes cell membranes to become leaky  <cit> , thus removing an important physical barrier to exogenous dna uptake. the combined effect of membrane porosity and chromosome breakage during desiccation could overcome obstacles for dna exchange, frequently cited as a barrier to eukaryotic hgt. second, bdelloids are known as ancient asexuals that lack normal meiosis  <cit> ; indeed, analysis of the genome of a. vaga shows that its chromosomes are organized in such a way as to make meiotic pairing difficult  <cit> , which by removing the need for chromosome pairing during meiosis could eliminate another obstacle to hgt usually present in eukaryotes. recent work found evidence contrary to expectations of strict clonality within a bdelloid species  <cit> , but it remains unclear whether that constitutes atypical meiosis or some other form of genetic exchange. it is also plausible that recombination could occur within bdelloid populations through the same mechanism as inter-kingdom hgt. while the exact nature of bdelloid reproduction and inheritance remains to be resolved, it is clear that they do not reproduce by conventional sex and meiosis.

if bdelloids do have far lower rates of sexual exchange and recombination than typical for animals, horizontally acquired genes might provide some compensation for the expected lack of genetic novelty, in a similar way that hgt facilitates adaptive shifts in prokaryotes  <cit> . the impact of hgt on bdelloid fitness would depend on the frequency of this process amongst bdelloid species. if the majority of foreign genes were acquired before the divergence of extant bdelloid species, uptake of novel genes cannot have contributed to the adaptation of species to new habitats. frequent and ongoing acquisition in diversifying lineages, however, would be consistent with the role of uptake of foreign genes in adaptive divergence.

we addressed these questions by sequencing the transcriptomes of four species from the genus rotaria. unlike most bdelloids, approximately 80 % of the  <dig> described rotaria species are fully aquatic  <cit> , although five described species are found in terrestrial habitats. it is therefore possible to analyze species that exist in a range of habitats exposed to different desiccation frequencies. of the four species sequenced here, rotaria magnacalcarata and rotaria socialis live as obligate epibionts on the fully aquatic waterlouse asellus aquaticus  <cit> ; these species therefore live permanently in freshwater. rotaria sordida lives on terrestrial moss  <cit>  and is likely to undergo frequent cycles of desiccation and rehydration, whereas rotaria tardigrada is found mostly in small ephemeral pools of water and therefore also experiences desiccation, but perhaps less frequently. we investigate whether recent hgt has contributed to the genetic divergence of these closely related species and compare this to the more distantly related adineta species of previous studies. do species differ in their complement of foreign genes, consistent with a role for hgt in divergence, or did they inherit a shared set of foreign genes from a common ancestor? taking advantage of the range of lifestyles, we also examine whether hgt has occurred more frequently in the two species living in desiccating habitats, as predicted by the dna repair hypothesis.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly
illumina reads of r. magnacalcarata, r. socialis, r. sordida and r. tardigrada transcriptomes were assembled using the trinity assembler into libraries containing  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcript contigs, with a mean length of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 714 bp, respectively. very low expression transcripts were excluded from further analysis  < <dig> and percentage of expression for a given transcript compared with all expression from that trinity component  <1), leaving  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts, respectively . the a. ricciae transcriptome assembly from illumina reads  <cit>  contained  <dig>  transcripts. of  <dig> mitochondrial genes commonly identified in bdelloid samples  <cit> ,  <dig> were identified in all four rotaria transcriptomes, along with both ssu rrna and lsu rrna genes. around half the transcripts yielded at least one significant basic local alignment search tool  hit  when compared to the uniprotkb database . overlap between rotaria and adineta transcriptomes is just under half: between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of transcripts of each rotaria species in turn returned blastn matches with the a. ricciae transcriptome at e-value ≤1e- <dig>  whereas between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of transcripts in each rotaria transcriptome have a homologous transcript in another rotaria sample with blastn match and e-value ≤1e- <dig>  transcripts found in more rotaria species are longer and have a higher average expression level . assemblies varied in terms of copy number: r. sordida and r. tardigrada samples have a higher proportion of genes with more than one alternative splice variant  relative to r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis  =  <dig> . <dig>  df =  <dig>  p < <dig> ).

proportion of putative foreign genes in rotaria species
putative foreign genes were identified using the hgt index  as described by boschetti et al.  <cit> . genes with hu ≥ <dig> have a much closer match to a non-metazoan protein than to a metazoan protein and were designated as foreign. of the  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts in r. magnacalcarata, r. socialis, r. sordida and r. tardigrada, respectively, with at least one hit in uniprotkb ,  <dig>  % of r. magnacalcarata,  <dig>  % of r. socialis,  <dig>  % of r. sordida and  <dig>  % of r. tardigrada transcripts were identified as foreign in origin . these numbers equal or exceed the  <dig>  % of a. ricciae transcripts with hu≥ <dig>  <cit> . the estimates are conservative for several filtering criteria. for example, decreasing the e-value required for inclusion to 1e- <dig> suggests  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of transcripts are foreign, respectively. similarly, raising the minimum transcript length to 600 bp leaves  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of transcripts, respectively, with hu ≥ <dig> . changing these parameters did not change the relative frequencies between species. likewise, changing the hu threshold used to define a transcript as foreign did not affect the relative proportions of hgt between species . around half of all transcripts were excluded from analysis because they failed to match any genes in uniprotkb , preventing the identification of their likely product. if these transcripts contained no foreign genes, this would decrease the estimated frequencies of hgt to  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in each species in turn, again not impacting the relative frequencies among species.fig.  <dig> desiccation tolerance and the proportion of horizontally transferred genes in four species of rotaria. left, blue: the proportion of individuals surviving desiccation and rehydration per species. error bars show 95 % binomial confidence intervals. right, red: the proportion of foreign genes with h

hgt and desiccation tolerance in rotaria
the proportion of foreign genes  differs significantly among rotaria species . r. tardigrada has a higher proportion of hgt  than r. sordida , which in turn has a higher proportion than r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis . r. socialis has a slightly lower proportion of hgt than r. magnacalcarata . we confirmed expected differences in desiccation tolerance among species by desiccating  <dig> individuals per species for 5 days, then rehydrating and scoring survival. the proportion of animals surviving desiccation differed significantly across species: no r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis from freshwater ponds survived, whereas  <dig>  % of r. sordida individuals from moss on trees and 50 % of r. tardigrada individuals from a temporary pond recovered after dehydration . r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis both had significantly lower survival than r. sordida  and r. tardigrada . the difference in survival between r. sordida and r. tardigrada was also significant . the two species with very low desiccation survival also had the lowest proportion of foreign genes , equating to a significant, negative relationship between desiccation survival and the proportion of hgt . this pattern is consistent with the predictions of the desiccation hypothesis.

foreign genes acquired before the divergence of adineta and rotaria
we compared presence/absence of foreign genes in relation to the phylogenetic relationships of the rotaria species . transcripts were grouped into orthologs using reciprocal blast hits . more than one third of the orthologs identified as putatively foreign in each rotaria species were also present in a. ricciae . the proportion of orthologs that were present in both rotaria and adineta increased further when higher hu thresholds were used to designate foreign orthologs . around half of these shared orthologs were present in all five species ; the rest were absent in one or more rotaria species. some transcripts were present in clusters of similar copies, which might reflect paralogs, sequencing or assembly error, or variation within sampled populations. we therefore repeated the analysis by first grouping transcripts across species into clusters using the markov clustering algorithm  and treating each gene cluster as a single putative hgt event. around half of the ortholog clusters were shared by rotaria and adineta .fig.  <dig> dated phylogeny of rotaria species and a. ricciae reconstructed from cox <dig>  18s and  <dig> nuclear genes. the tree was calibrated using published substitution rates of cox <dig> and 18s . all clades have posterior probability support values =  <dig> . the number of mcl orthologs unique to each species and clade are shown above branches

rotaria
rotaria + adineta


we conclude that a core set of foreign genes was present in the common ancestor of rotaria and adineta. we verified this conclusion with two further analyses. first, we checked the phylogenetic distribution of four foreign genes by sequencing pcr-amplified genomic loci in a wider range of species encompassing three of the four bdelloid families . three of these genes were shared by rotaria and adineta transcriptomes and one was unique to adineta. we found that each gene was monophyletic within bdelloids and hence likely arose from a single origin. two genes were shared in two families , one was found in three families  and the gene that was only present in a. ricciae was only successfully amplified in several species from the family adinetidae, confirming its specificity.

second, to check further for possible lateral transfer of shared foreign genes among bdelloids, we compared the phylogenetic signal of shared metazoan and foreign genes across species. we used the  <dig>  orthologs identified by reciprocal blast matches that were present in all five transcriptomes . in a tree containing four rotaria species, rooted with a. ricciae, there are  <dig> possible topologies . of  <dig>  “shared metazoan orthologs”,  <dig>  % conformed to topology 15: r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis monophyletic, and r. sordida and r. tardigrada monophyletic: , ). this match relationship was reported by fontaneto et al.  <cit>  based on cox <dig> and 28s sequences and is supported by cox <dig> data from the transcriptomes . among  <dig> “shared foreign orthologs”,  <dig>  % also had topology  <dig>  other topologies were also supported for a number of transcripts; for example, topology  <dig> ,sor),tar) was supported in  <dig>  % metazoan and  <dig>  % foreign shared orthologs. foreign gene trees were no less consistent with current understanding of rotaria relationships than native genes, and in fact showed less variation in topology than metazoan genes . shared horizontally acquired genes have diverged at a similar rate to their native counterparts, most genes were under purifying selection and the proportion of genes under positive selection is comparable .table  <dig> topologies supported by orthologous genes



foreign genes acquired after the divergence of rotaria from adineta
of the foreign gene clusters found in rotaria but not shared with a. ricciae,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of those in r. magnacalcarata, r. socialis, r. sordida and r. tardigrada in turn were also present in at least one non-sister rotaria species . rotaria species experiencing more frequent desiccation have a higher proportion of unique genes. foreign gene clusters shared by but unique to r. sordida and r. tardigrada are five times more abundant than genes shared by but unique to the sister species of r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis . the number of foreign gene clusters unique to single species also varies:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clusters are unique to r. magnacalcarata, r. socialis, r. sordida and r. tardigrada, respectively. the percentage of genes that are unique to a single species was marginally higher using reciprocal blast to delineate orthologs instead of mcl  and marginally lower using stricter thresholds for assigning foreign transcripts . however, the number and proportion of genes that are unique to either single species or sister species pairs was always higher for r. sordida and r. tardigrada than for r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis.

the gc content of a newly acquired gene should more closely resemble that of the donor species, but over time it will approach the gc content of the genome into which it has been transferred  <cit> ; therefore, the gc content of a horizontally acquired gene should reflect the time since acquisition. the mean gc content of r. magnacalcarata, r. socialis, r. sordida and r. tardigrada transcripts retained for hgt detection analysis is  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. in all species, gc content is most different from the background transcriptome in foreign transcripts that were only identified in a single species, and decreases significantly towards the background gc content for the species as the number of species that share the transcript increase . this supports the supposition that unique transcripts were acquired more recently.fig.  <dig> percentage gc content of foreign genes in relation to phylogenetic distribution. gc content displayed as percentage gc content of foreign genes minus the background average gc of transcripts. transcripts were classified as unique to species, to sister species, the genus rotaria or found in both rotaria and adineta. gc content declines towards background levels in foreign genes with an earlier inferred entry into bdelloid genomes



validating the distribution of foreign genes using a draft whole genome assembly
in principle, genes absent from a particular transcriptome might be present in the species’ genome but simply not expressed at the time of rna sampling. to examine this possibility, we searched for foreign genes in a draft genome assembly of one species, r. magnacalcarata. we estimated that the genome assembly was 87 % complete based on representation of  <dig> core proteins expected across a wide range of organisms  <cit> . blast results confirmed the transcriptome results: 79 % of foreign gene clusters inferred to be unique to r. magnacalcarata were found in its genome scaffolds . a further four gene clusters matched to unscaffolded genome contigs taking the recovery rate to 85 %, which is within the margin of error expected based on the completeness of the genome assembly. in contrast, only  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of foreign genes inferred to be unique to r. socialis, r. sordida and r. tardigrada, respectively, were found on r. magnacalcarata genome scaffolds. the false negative rate for unique foreign genes is therefore less than 10 %. similarly, 94 % of foreign genes shared by r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis were present in r. magnacalcarata genome scaffolds compared with only 6 % of those defined as shared by r. sordida and r. tardigrada. assuming a similar false negative rate for all transcriptomes would lead to a decrease in the numbers and proportions of unique genes relative to shared genes, but the differences between the two pairs of sister species would remain .

it is also possible that foreign genes represent contamination, for example by the rna or dna of a commensal non-metazoan. in fact, 71 %  of the foreign genes unique to r. magnacalcarata found on genomic scaffolds were on a scaffold that also included a native transcript . we searched genbank for matches to the remaining scaffolds that contained a foreign gene but no native genes, to check whether they might be wholly non-metazoan. of  <dig> scaffolds, three yielded a match with a. vaga , two yielded matches to other metazoa , two to prokaryotes, one to fungi but only over short fragments representing the foreign gene itself , and nine yielded no matches at all . thus, we found no evidence that these scaffolds derive from contaminating, non-metazoan sequences.fig.  <dig> the distribution of foreign genes unique to the transcriptome of r. magnacalcarata across scaffolds of the draft assembly of the r. magnacalcarata genome. scaffolds are sorted in order of length. blue, foreign transcript unique to r. magnacalcarata; green, foreign gene shared with other rotifer species; orange, native gene 



rate of hgt across species
we reconstructed a dated phylogeny of the rotaria species and a. ricciae . the most recent common ancestor of rotaria dates to  <dig> million years ago ), whereas r. sordida and r. tardigrada diverged  <dig>  mya  and r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis  <dig>  mya . these dates rely on general substitution rates of cox <dig> and 18s rdna for animals and so should be regarded as approximate. by reconstructing parsimony unambiguous gains and losses, we estimate an overall rate of gain of horizontally transferred genes of  <dig>   genes and rate of loss of  <dig>   genes per lineage per million years . the rates of gain and loss on individual species branches had overlapping confidence intervals, although r. magnacalcarata had around half the rate of gain of the other species. however, comparing the rates of gain and loss between the two pairs of sister species , there was a threefold higher rate of gain and sixfold lower rate of loss in the r. sordida and r. tardigrada clade than in the r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis clade.fig.  <dig> average rates of gain and loss of foreign orthologs along the branch leading to each species, within the two clades of sister species  and across all rotaria. mcl clusters corrected for false negative rates inferred from analysis of the r. magnacalcarata genome were used to estimate gains and losses; values for other versions of the analysis are in additional file 1: table s <dig>  error bars indicated 95 % hpd across beast trees also incorporating poisson errors in the rate process 



origin of foreign transcripts
of the complete set of foreign transcripts, transcripts of putative eubacterial origin comprise on average  <dig>  % of transcripts, archaeal sequences only comprise  <dig>  % of transcripts,  <dig>  % most closely resemble fungal proteins,  <dig>  % of transcripts most closely resemble plant proteins and  <dig>  % of transcripts most closely resemble protist proteins. species differences are not large except that more of the foreign gene transcripts unique to r. socialis have their best blastx hit in protists than in the other species :  <dig>  % compared to  <dig>  % in r. magnacalcarata,  <dig>  % in r. sordida and  <dig>  % in r. tardigrada. these  <dig> transcripts belong to  <dig> markov clusters based on sequence similarity, so the high number is not due to post-acquisition proliferation of a few horizontally acquired genes. a blastx search of transcripts revealed repeated matches in paramecium tetraurelia , tetrahymena thermophila  and ichthyophthirius multifiliis . these are all alveolates from the class oligohymenophorea, and the latter two both from the order hymenostomatida. in principle, this could be the result of rna contamination from a protist accidentally harvested from the waterlouse host alongside r. socialis. however, all of these transcripts differ greatly from any sequenced protist gene  and so any contaminating protist would have to be very divergent from any sequenced protist. furthermore, a blastn search of all r. socialis foreign transcripts identified no hits with e <1e- <dig> to alveolate ribosomal rna. if the  <dig> putatively alveolate genes were the result of contamination, it is likely that rrna would also have been identified; its absence fails to support the contamination hypothesis.

functional annotation of foreign transcripts
rotaria foreign transcripts were annotated with gene ontology  terms  <cit>   and enzyme commission  numbers . of the  <dig>  % of foreign transcripts that were assigned a go annotation, most are enzymes as they were assigned an ec number as well . enzymes with an ec number represent a significantly higher proportion of ancestral transcripts than either transcripts common to sister species or unique transcripts . many of the enzymes are involved in general metabolism, especially metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins . these include enzymes for catabolism of plant , fungal  and bacterial  cell walls, which might contribute to improved digestion or energy extraction from food. some of these enzymes have been acquired by particular species or pairs of sister species but the majority are ancestral. enzymes matching to stress responses are also prevalent, mainly as transcripts unique to particular species . curiously, r. socialis has acquired enzymes apparently linked to water deprivation , heat stress and osmotic stress ; there is nothing known in its habits to suggest it would experience these conditions more frequently than the other species. some other classes of enzymes were significantly over-represented in particular species that had general annotations that were harder to link to potential ecological differences . for example, r. socialis had an excess of foreign genes involved in protein transport compared to other species. r. sordida had an excess of enzymes with monooxygenase activity and of those binding nadp, whereas r. tardigrada had an excess of genes with oxidoreductase activity acting on ch-oh donors and of those binding atp.table  <dig> categorization of foreign transcripts according to their potential role in macromolecular catabolism or stress and with respect to their distribution across species



to test further for differential presence of foreign genes related to water stress and desiccation, we searched for annotated functions matching those of genes potentially associated with desiccation tolerance in a. ricciae. we expected that these genes might have been differentially lost in the desiccation intolerant commensal species. among the functions suggested to be differentially regulated during desiccation of a. ricciae  <cit> , seven  were found among the rotaria foreign orthologs; a further one, catalase, was found in r. sordida but clustered in a native ortholog. we also searched for enzymes associated with glutathione and trypanothione metabolism, which are considered powerful antioxidants, and which could protect bdelloid cells against oxidative damage during desiccation  <cit> . of  <dig> orthologs present in the rotaria transcriptomes, three were judged to have been lost in r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis, which is a higher ratio than expected from background rates of loss of foreign orthologs in those species . this suggests, therefore, that foreign genes potentially associated with protection from desiccation damage have been lost in the commensal species.

discussion
we found that  <dig> – <dig>  % of transcripts had hu ≥ <dig> in the four rotaria species examined. to date, calculation of the portion of foreign genes in bdelloid genomes or transcriptomes has focused on species from a single genus, adineta, within the family adinetidae and on a couple of genomic regions for one species of philodinidae  <cit> . finding evidence of a high proportion of hgt in species from multiple families demonstrates that abundant hgt is not unique to adineta species, with their presumed frequent cycles of desiccation and rehydration, but is a feature of bdelloid rotifers more widely, even those from permanently aquatic habitats.

nearly half of foreign genes expressed by r. magnacalcarata, r. socialis, r. sordida, r. tardigrada and a. ricciae are common to both families philodinidae and adinetidae. these genes are most parsimoniously assumed to have been present in the common ancestor. the alternative explanation of substantial rotifer-to-rotifer hgt of foreign genes after the divergence of bdelloid species seems unlikely; gene trees based on foreign genes and on metazoan genes are congruent, and where foreign genes were examined in more detail, monophyly of these genes within bdelloids points to a single uptake event of each horizontally acquired gene. furthermore, the gc content of shared foreign genes is much closer to that of the metazoan bdelloid transcripts than the gc content of species-specific foreign genes, consistent with their presence in bdelloid genomes for a longer time  <cit> . these genes were therefore acquired before the divergence of bdelloid families. foreign genes common to adineta and rotaria species present a rare example of a large number of foreign genes being acquired and then maintained in a eukaryotic genome through millions of years and multiple speciation events. the acquisition of many enzymes with novel functions might have enhanced biochemical diversity in bdelloids, allowing them to perform some of their unusual functions, such as desiccation tolerance  <cit> .

alongside foreign genes identified as common to rotaria and adineta species, we also identified genes common to the genus rotaria, genes common to sister species only, and those unique to individual species. the number of foreign genes in any bdelloid genome is the result of both gains and losses over time, so the higher number of foreign genes in some species could conceivably be due to either or both of these processes: more gains in some species or more losses in others. however, the average gc content of foreign genes becomes more similar to that of the background bdelloid genome the more species that gene is shared by. this finding implies that genes shared by fewer species have been gained more recently by these species, rather than having been differentially lost from the others  <cit> . these more recently acquired genes demonstrate that hgt is an ongoing process in multiple bdelloid species, and could potentially provide genetic variation underlying species differences. however, the high proportion of ancient foreign genes, along with the slow rate of gain of  <dig>  genes per million years highlights the fact that inter-kingdom hgt in bdelloids can by no means be considered as a “replacement for sex”. we could not quantify uptake of dna from other metazoans here because of insufficient sampling of closely related metazoan genomes to identify transfer; it is likely that bdelloids also take up metazoan dna and this might occur at a faster rate than inter-kingdom hgt.

rotaria species with higher desiccation tolerance  have more unique expressed genes than those unable to survive desiccation . foreign genes shared by and unique to r. sordida and r. tardigrada are nearly five times more abundant than genes shared by r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis, and accumulated at a faster rate. the relationship between hgt and desiccation tolerance/frequency needs to be examined in more bdelloid species encompassing multiple shifts in habitat type, but findings from within rotaria provide initial support for the hypothesis that the rate of hgt is increased by cycles of desiccation and rehydration in bdelloid rotifers  <cit> . this unusual feature of bdelloid ecology could provide part of the explanation for why bdelloid rotifers have such an extraordinarily high level of hgt for metazoans. however, the two fully aquatic species both show evidence of hgt since their divergence. either complete desiccation is not a strict requirement of hgt, or these species might still recover from desiccation rarely or in particular desiccating conditions.

the foreign genes identified in bdelloids have been acquired from multiple different kingdoms  <cit> . in rotaria we find that the majority come from eubacteria followed in descending order by protists, fungi, plants and archaea. similar frequencies were found in a. ricciae, although that species had relatively more prokaryotic origins and half the frequency of protist genes  <cit> . the high representation of bacterial genes in eukaryotic hgt is likely to be related to bacterial size and ubiquity, which makes them more likely to live alongside, be food for, or be pathogens of, multicellular eukaryotic species. in the laboratory the most successful food sources for bdelloid rotifers are bacteria and fungi  <cit> . there are two possible explanations for the finding of over-abundance of protist genes in r. socialis: contamination of extracted rna by an alveolate protist or a large uptake of protist genes into the r. socialis genome after the divergence from r. magnacalcarata. contamination is unlikely because of the lack of protist ribosomal genes in the transcriptome. r. magnacalcarata and r. socialis both live on the ventral side of the waterlouse: r. socialis is found at the sides, close to the legs, whilst r. magnacalcarata is distributed towards the anterior median of the host animal  <cit> . cook and chubb  <cit>  demonstrated that peritrich protists  make up nearly 90 % of the epifauna of asellus aquaticus, and their scanning electron microscope  analysis showed that the majority of these species are found to the periphery and on the legs of the ventral side of the waterlouse. r. socialis might have taken up protist genes thanks to its greater proximity to epibiont protists relative to r. magnacalcarata, although mechanisms of hgt remain obscure for all bdelloids.

to be maintained in the genome of all these species since the divergence of rotaria and adineta species, the foreign genes common to all species must have had little negative fitness impact on the individuals. the presence of foreign genes in transcriptomes indicates that these genes are expressed, although in line with the hypothesis of park and zhang  <cit>  that highly expressed genes are not favoured for hgt, they are expressed at a slightly lower level in comparison to total transcripts .

consistent with previous findings in a. ricciae  <cit>  and studies in prokaryotes  <cit> , we found that a high proportion of foreign genes in rotaria govern metabolic functions. a significantly higher percentage of foreign transcripts acquired before the divergence of adineta and rotaria species were annotated with ec numbers in comparison to more recently acquired foreign genes, suggesting that in rotaria horizontally acquired genes encoding biochemical functions may be more likely to be retained than other genes. foreign genes have contributed hundreds of novel enzymes associated with a range of annotated functions of potential ecological importance. in particular, there are many enzymes involved in the catabolism of macromolecules that might play a role in extracting energy from food sources. diets of bdelloids are difficult to observe directly in the wild and tools for genetic knockouts in bdelloids are still being developed, but future work could test for differential expression of shared and unique foreign enzymes when cultured in the laboratory on different diets.

we found no evidence for greater acquisition of stress-related genes in the desiccating species – on the contrary, r. socialis has acquired an excess of water, salt and heat stress genes. it is possible that these genes perform different functions than in their donor organism or they might protect against other forms of stress such as freezing or anoxia, which are known to be experienced by the waterlouse. some of the foreign genes with no annotation or unclear affiliation to stress responses in r. sordida and r. tardigrada might also play a role in desiccation tolerance and, again, future work could test for differential expression of unique enzymes under different stress conditions. there was evidence, however, for differential loss of ancestral foreign genes in the two commensal species, including genes involved with the production of antioxidants that are thought to protect against oxidative damage during desiccation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
many of the horizontally acquired genes identified in bdelloid rotifers are likely to have been inherited from the common ancestor of all bdelloid species, but a significant subset of foreign genes have been acquired more recently and are unique to specific lineages, especially those from desiccating habitats. while genes acquired in a common ancestor can have had no role in providing genetic novelty between bdelloid species, genes acquired post-divergence of bdelloid taxa have contributed differences in enzyme complements. further work is now needed to identify the contribution of native genes versus foreign genes to adaptive trait differences between these species. differential acquisition of foreign genes is known to contribute to adaptation and speciation in prokaryotes  <cit> , and our results are consistent with a similar role in this clade of animals.
