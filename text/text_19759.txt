BACKGROUND
matrix metalloproteases  are a family of zinc dependent proteases responsible for the extracellular matrix turnover and degradation of bioactive proteins. in cerebral ischemia, mmps  <dig> and  <dig>  also designated as gelatinases a  and b  have been identified to mediate the degradation of the basal lamina  <cit>  and hemorrhagic transformation  <cit> . mmps  <dig> and  <dig> have been shown to be elevated a few hours after ischemia  <cit>  and to maintain increased activity for days after the onset  <cit> . the inhibition of these enzymes by specific class inhibitors reverts breakdown of laminin  <cit>  and prevents increased barrier permeability, edema, and hemorrhage after ischemic stroke  <cit> . the development of mmp inhibitors as therapeutic agents has been limited by their poor solubility.

minocycline is a commonly used semi-synthetic tetracycline with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties  <cit> . minocycline interferes with mmp activity  <cit>  and has been shown to be neuroprotective in cerebral ischemia  <cit>  and in other models of brain injury  <cit> .

in this study we investigated whether minocycline prevents ischemia-induced mmp activation in a temporary model of temporary focal cerebral ischemia in rats, and explored the dose-response relationship and possible specificity of in vitro mmp-inhibition by this drug. because mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> have distinct mechanisms of activation and different roles after stroke, the potential selectivity of minocycline for either enzyme should be determined. furthermore, mmp inhibition may be the central mechanism through which minocycline provides neurovascular protection  <cit> . there are currently no drugs marketed specifically for their ability to inhibit systemic mmps. minocycline could represent a new clinical approach to inhibiting acute mmp activation, reducing the risk of development of hemorrhage and protecting the patient from further damage after acute ischemic stroke.

RESULTS
mmp activity after ischemic stroke
the  <dig> hour ischemia followed by  <dig> hour survival after reperfusion caused increased activity of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> in the ischemic hemisphere  as compared to the contra-lateral hemisphere . the densitometric analysis revealed also that intra-peritoneal minocycline  <dig> mg/kg treatment twice a day , significantly reduced the ischemia-induced increments in both mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> active gelatinolytic forms   . the same treatment regimen with intra-peritoneal minocycline also significantly reduced the ischemia-induced increase in mmp total protein concentration  .

neurological evaluation
all animals had a significant deficit  prior to reperfusion, demonstrating successful mcao. the neurological scores did not show a significant difference between the treatment and control groups. the scale shows a high variability between animals and a much higher sample size is required to detect a significant difference.

in vitro mmp inhibition by minocycline
the densitometric analysis revealed that minocycline at  <dig>  μg/ml,  <dig>  μg/ml,  <dig> μg/ml,  <dig> μg/ml,  <dig> μg/ml,  <dig> μg/ml,  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml concentrations significantly inhibited the activity of recombinant mmp- <dig> and recombinant mmp- <dig> as compared to the control enzymatic activity. the inhibitory effect of minocycline in both enzymes was similar or slightly greater than the positive control edta in  <dig> μg/ml concentration . there was a significant interaction between the two proteases and minocycline drug concentration such that, at concentrations of  <dig> ug/ml and below, the percent inhibition is significantly higher for mmp- <dig>  .

discussion
this study demonstrated for the first time that delayed treatment with minocycline inhibits mmps that are elevated after temporary experimental cerebral ischemia. in addition, this inhibitory effect is present over a wide range of clinically relevant and safe concentrations of minocycline. in fact, the minocycline concentration expected in the brain after a normal dose of  <dig> mg in humans , is equivalent to  <dig> – <dig> μg/ml  <cit>  and is higher than the lowest in vitro doses tested. furthermore, our results reinforce previous findings that minocycline is a potent inhibitor of mmp- <dig> in vivo  <cit>  and in vitro  <cit>  and suggests a sensitivity of this enzyme for the drug when compared to mmp- <dig>  our drug dosing regimen was based on previous studies demonstrating therapeutic efficacy of intra-peritoneal minocycline  <dig> mg/kg in experimental stroke  <cit>  and to achieve a constant plasma concentration since the timing of mmp activation spike has not yet been identified either in humans or in rodents. intra-peritoneal delivery of minocycline in our model of stroke also insures that regardless of differences in the pharmacokinetics of this drug in rodents, the drug will be present whenever the activation of the mmp enzymes occurs, as the delivery of the drug is slow and constant.

minocycline has been shown to be neuroprotective  <cit> . one common pathophysiological mechanism of models of brain ischemic damage is the dysregulation of the proteolytic cascade at the level of the endothelial and microglial cells. interference of this cascade by minocycline might be the central pathway for these neurovascular protective properties of decreasing tissue injury and also providing functional recovery. ischemic stroke activates a complex cascade of events  <cit> . the first tissue damage occurs as early as a few minutes after the occlusion. within hours after stroke onset, endothelial and inflammatory cells respond to ischemia releasing proteases mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> that culminate in degradation of the basal lamina and ultimate weakening of the blood brain barrier  <cit> . the subsequent events are leakage of leukocytes into the parenchyma, and brain edema followed by neuronal death that occurs in the later hours of ischemia. since mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> are believed to be largely responsible for the degradation of the blood brain barrier and also involved in the signaling of neuronal cell death  <cit> , the inhibition of the proteolytic cascade is a logical target for several models of brain injury that involve matrix degradation and vascular instability  <cit> .

our studies point to an apparent selectivity of minocycline for mmp- <dig> with low dose minocycline. this could reflect either a time profile difference between the activation of the two enzymes, the pathway minocycline interferes, or a chemical selectivity for mmp- <dig>  among the main differences between their molecular pathways, mmp- <dig> is constitutively expressed, while mmp- <dig> can be stimulated at the level of gene activation by multiple stimuli including ischemia. both enzymes are expressed as pro-forms and after they are secreted they require chemical or proteolytic activation to become functional  <cit> . in endothelial brain cells, little is known about the presence and regulation of the different mmps  <cit> . further studies are necessary to determine the mechanisms of activation of mmps in the brain after ischemia and the mechanism by which minocycline decreases mmp activity.

minocycline has in its chemical structure an active binding site that confers the ability to chelate divalent ions. our in vitro studies confirm that minocycline is able to inhibit gelatin digestion by mmps by interacting with these enzymes. mmps require zinc in their active site for functional activity and removal of the zinc results in change of conformation and inactivation of the enzyme. tetracyclines have been shown to inhibit collagenolysis  <cit>  and inhibit mmp- <dig> activity  <cit> . previous studies, however, have shown that multiple tetracyclines can inhibit collagenase mmps via down-regulation of gene expression in a cellular model of rheumatoid arthritis using cultured chondrocytes  <cit>  and that pre-treatment with minocycline down-regulates pro-mmp expression after permanent cerebral ischemia  <cit> . furthermore, because minocycline has been shown to be neuroprotective in different models of brain injury, it is likely to act by multiple mechanisms, with mmp inhibition being a central link for its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties in the ischemic cascade and reperfusion. our studies are pioneer in investigating the ability of minocycline to decrease mmp activity in the setting of a temporary model of stroke, and with treatment occurring post reperfusion. increase in mmp activity and its consequences are relevant in stroke from the standpoint of ischemic damage itself and also from the standpoint of delayed reperfusion damage alone.

in order to determine the clinical relevance of these findings for acute stroke treatment, the next step is to determine if the mmp inhibition by minocycline in a model of temporary occlusion will result in decreased blood brain barrier degradation and decreased hemorrhage formation. in addition, the vascular protection properties of minocycline should also be studied for ischemic stroke after treatment with tissue plasminogen activator . tpa is currently the only available acute treatment for ischemic stroke patients but its application is limited due to the increased risk of serious intracerebral bleeding  <cit> . because tpa is an extracellular protease and is not highly specific for plasminogen cleavage, reperfusion with tpa might amplify the mmp damage in the brain as has been previously speculated  <cit>  and concurrent administration of minocycline with tpa or other reperfusion agents might be a potential approach for reestablishing blood flow without compromising the vasculature. these studies are currently ongoing.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies provide evidence that the inhibition of mmp enzymatic activity can be achieved with intraperitoneal treatment of minocycline after experimental ischemic stroke. mmp inhibition is likely a mechanism through which minocycline is neuroprotective in stroke. furthermore, the in vitro inhibitory effect of minocycline is observed at very low therapeutic concentrations with mmp- <dig> being more. because thrombolytic agents exacerbate the proteolytic cascade, minocycline raises optimism for the acute treatment of ischemic stroke patients. minocycline is a candidate neuroprotective agent to be used in combination with tpa.
