BACKGROUND
sepsis is a condition characterized by tachycardia, fever and leukocytosis. in severe cases, refractory hypotension and failure of multiple organ systems develops. reportedly, the incidence of sepsis more than tripled between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . it is estimated that the mortality rate due to sepsis in the general population of the united states is  <dig> %  <cit> , and the number of deaths is increasing annually  <cit> . although mortality due to sepsis remains unacceptably high in the general population, rates of death among the obese patient population are even higher. in fact, death in morbidly obese subjects is approximately  <dig> times more likely to occur  <cit> . morbidity in obese patients is also more severe. compared to lean patients, more time is spent in intensive care units and on mechanical ventilation devices  <cit> . causes for enhanced morbidity and mortality in obese patients remain unknown. moreover, obesity in the united states is reaching epidemic proportions with more than 60% of adults now classified as overweight or obese. given the difficulties and higher costs of the clinical management of these patients in addition to the growing rates of obesity, there is an urgent need to address this issue.

various environmental factors are believed to be causally related to the obese state. examples of these include physical inactivity and poor dietary habits, which result in caloric imbalance  <cit> . typical eating patterns among obese populations in the us consist of foods that are high in saturated fat, sugars and cholesterol, the so-called "western diet" . thus, previous investigations have focused on elucidating the contribution of diet to the development of systemic pathologies. cholesterol and saturated fatty acids have been linked to activation of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades in cultured macrophages  <cit> . these results are supported by findings in vivo of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in baboons fed a high cholesterol/high saturated fat diet  <cit> .

in an effort to understand how wd influences pathophysiology, we examined hepatic inflammation in mice fed a diet that derived a large proportion of total calories  from butter fat, which contains a significant amount of the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid . to induce hepatic inflammation a murine model of cecal ligation and puncture was used to mimic sepsis. previous studies indicate that saturated fatty acids stimulate a pro-inflammatory phenotype in cultured cells via the toll-like receptor  <dig> pathway  <cit> . moreover, feeding mice diets high in fat has been shown to enhance evidence of tlr- <dig> signaling and mice deficient in tlr- <dig> signaling are protected from diet-induced steatohepatitis  <cit> . since the tlr- <dig> pathway mediates the hepatic response to invading bacteria, we hypothesized that the combined effects of sepsis and feeding wd on trl- <dig> signaling would exacerbate hepatic inflammation in septic mice.

RESULTS
weight status in mice fed western diet
the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of overweight status on the livers of septic mice. accordingly, mice were fed high-calorie wd for  <dig> weeks prior to induction of sepsis via clp. average daily food intake in the wd group was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  grams/mouse/day and was statistically higher than amounts consumed by mice fed cd . this resulted in a significant increase in the total amount of calories consumed by mice fed wd . as a result, body weight gain was more than 2-fold higher in mice fed wd .

leukocyte trafficking is enhanced in mice fed western diet
intravital microscopy was used for real-time assessment of leukocyte trafficking in the liver  <dig> h after clp. leukocytes were considered to be adherent if they were stationary for more than  <dig> seconds of the  <dig> minute observation period. feeding wd to sham controls had no significant effect on cell adhesion. in mice fed cd, a minimal number of leukocytes were found to adhere within terminal hepatic venules in the sham operated group . as expected, clp exaggerated the adherence of leukocytes  and platelets  in both dietary groups, a phenomenon that was significantly more pronounced in wd-fed mice. to determine if increased adherence was due to elevations in the number of circulating leukocyte in mice fed wd, whole blood samples were evaluated for leukocyte content. results indicated that total leukocyte counts were similar between cd-  and wd-fed mice  prior to clp.

western diet exaggerates hepatic inflammation
to further index the hepatic inflammatory state total rna was isolated to analyze expression of representative markers. accordingly, mrna levels of icam- <dig>  tnf-α, and mcp- <dig> were analyzed using real-time pcr. expression of tnf-α, and icam-  <dig> was increased by approximately four-fold  <dig> h after clp in cd-fed mice ; however, these markers were not elevated by feeding western diet in the absence of clp. in the wd + clp group a dramatic augmentation of tnf-α and icam- <dig> expression was observed. expression of mcp- <dig> was also increased by approximately 3- and 30-fold in mice fed cd or wd, respectively following clp. induction of this chemokine was also enhanced significantly by feeding wd to sham control mice .

evidence of increased toll-like receptor- <dig> expression
it is well known that toll-like receptors aid in host defense against invading bacterial pathogens. in an attempt to identify possible mechanisms by which feeding wd might enhance the inflammatory response to clp we examined the influence of wd on tlr- <dig> expression. as expected, a marked increase in tlr- <dig> mrna was observed after feeding wd in sham mice . messenger rna levels of tlr- <dig> were diminished by clp; however, expression remained significantly higher in wd-fed mice.

palmitic acid enhances the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide
a major component of the wd used in this study is palmitic acid . exposure of macrophages to pa has been shown to stimulate pro-inflammatory conditions and studies suggest that the response to saturated fatty acids, including pa, is mediated via the tlr- <dig> signaling pathway  <cit> . based on findings of enhanced tlr- <dig> expression in mice fed wd, we hypothesized that pa augments the response to bacterial toxins . to address this question, the direct inflammatory response to lps, pa or the combination of these was investigated in cultured c3a human hepatocytes. after  <dig> h, mrna levels of tlr- <dig> and the chemokine il- <dig> were measured by real-time pcr. exposure of c3a cells to lps or pa for  <dig> h did not result in notable cell death as demonstrated by the lack trypan blue uptake . the low dose of endotoxin used in this study  did not alter expression of these parameters, whereas pa increased expression of both markers by approximately 5-fold . moreover, the combination of lps + pa further enhanced expression by 15- to 30-fold.

palmitic acid enhances u <dig> adhesion via a tlr4-dependent mechanism
to investigate the potential importance of tlr- <dig> in the pro-inflammatory condition resulting from pa, a static adhesion assay was performed in which one experimental series included c3a cells pretreated with an anti-tlr-4/md <dig> blocking antibody. following stimulation of c3a cells with pa, u <dig> cells were allowed to settle on the c3a monolayer and the number of firmly adherent cells was determined following inversion of the co-cultures. a minimal number of u <dig> cells were observed to adhere to mock-stimulated c3a cells . consistent with in vivo video microscopy results, pa potentiated adhesion by approximately 60% above control values. this response was largely blocked by addition of the tlr-4/md <dig> blocking antibody.

discussion
recent findings in rodent models provide insight into the influences of obesity on the pathogenesis of sepsis. for example, brain microvascular defects were found to be significantly worse in genetically obese ob/ob mice  <cit> . in the gut, microvascular dysfunction, inflammation and thrombocytopenia were enhanced in septic ob/ob mice and hyperphagic db/db mice when compared to their lean controls  <cit> . during sepsis, the liver is one of the most commonly affected organs and hepatic failure in this setting is often fatal  <cit> . moreover, obese patients are likely to be more sensitive to sepsis  <cit> , possibly due to the presence of hepatic steatosis or the more extensive pathology known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a condition involving steatosis, inflammation, necrosis and may also include some degree of fibrosis. thus, the present study addressed the influence of obesity specifically on the hepatic microvasculature. approximately 72% of the daily energy intake in western cultures is provided by processed foods such as cereals, refined sugar and refined oils that would not have been available prior to the industrial revolution. additional agricultural advances have greatly enhanced the constitutive level of saturated fatty acids in domesticated animals used for food, primarily due to grain feeding. since genetic causes for obesity are relatively rare in humans, we chose a more clinical approach to obesity, feeding a diet with a nutrient content resembling what is consumed by humans in western cultures. consistent with previous findings in the gut and brain of genetically obese mice, the dietary obesity model used herein exacerbated leukocyte and platelet adhesion in terminal hepatic venules. to index the inflammatory state, mrna levels of icam- <dig> and mcp- <dig> were determined. respectively, these well-characterized proteins mediate the firm adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells as well as hepatocytes and the chemotaxis of monocytes/macrophages. the typical expression pattern of icam- <dig>  mcp- <dig> and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α expected in septic mice was exaggerated in mice fed wd. since our initial evaluations of whole blood prior to clp revealed that total leukocyte counts were similar between cd- and wd-fed mice, it is not likely that the observed enhanced adhesion was due to increased total cell numbers; however, the influence of clp on total leukocyte counts was not evaluated.

in an attempt to uncover the molecular signal for enhanced inflammation following clp in mice fed wd, we investigated components of tlr- <dig> signaling. this receptor is expressed on most cell types in the liver, including kupffer cells, endothelial cells and hepatocytes. our results revealed increased tlr- <dig> mrna levels.. this is consistent with the idea that the inflammatory response caused by the diet is mediated through the tlr- <dig> signaling pathway. indeed, several investigations have now reported a link between inflammation and tlr- <dig> signaling in rodents fed high fat diet and in isolated cells exposed to purified fatty acids  <cit> . base on these findings, we hypothesized that the saturated fatty acid component of wd may be important for the development of the exaggerated inflammatory phenotype observed in septic mice. as expected, pa enhanced chemokine  expression, tlr- <dig> mrna levels and the static adhesion of monocytes to c3a hepatocytes. static adhesion was significantly diminished in the presence of an anti-tlr-4/md <dig> antibody. this supports previously published findings that saturated fatty acids activate the innate immune response via signaling through tlr- <dig>  <cit> . recently, it was reported that the effects of saturated fatty acids could be blocked by polymyxin b, suggesting that the observed inflammatory influence of fatty acids was attributable to endotoxin  <cit> . these observations were generated using hek- <dig> cell that were transfect with tlr- <dig> as this cell line does not express an endogenous form of this receptor. thus, the exact nature of the interaction between tlr- <dig>  fatty acids and endotoxin requires further investigation. it should be noted that clp decreased mrna levels of tlr- <dig>  diminished tlr- <dig> expression has also been reported in isolated cells exposed directly to endotoxin  <cit> ; however, the reason for this down-regulation response during infection is not known.

alternatively, fatty acids may directly modify proteins such as those involved in the inflammatory cascade. for example, it is well known that leukocytes and platelets are important mediators of the disturbances in the microvasculature that are hallmark features of sepsis  <cit> . p-selectin is an adhesion molecule that is constitutively expressed by megakaryocytes and is found at high levels on the surface of activated platelets  <cit> . the saturated fatty acids pa and stearic acid have both been shown to acylate p-selectin  <cit> , which has been postulated to regulate the function and intracellular trafficking of this receptor. in addition to leukocytes we found a significant induction of platelet adhesion in terminal hepatic venules that was augmented significantly by feeding wd. although not tested directly herein, previous observations of p-selectin acylation by pa suggest a potential mechanism for how wd might affect platelet/leukocyte adhesion and contribution to vascular defects during sepsis. the direct effects of other constituents in wd remain to be tested.

CONCLUSIONS
in the context of the present results it is concluded that diet is causally related to the exaggerated response to sepsis observed in obese subjects. the inflammatory phenotype was partially mimicked by exposing hepatocytes to pa. the wd formulation we used also contains carbohydrates and cholesterol. since these have also been shown to promote inflammation  <cit> , a role in enhanced inflammation during clp can not be ruled out.

mortality due to sepsis in morbidly obese subjects is estimated to be  <dig> times more prevalent compared to mortality in lean individuals  <cit> . morbidity in obese patients is also more severe  <cit> . given the difficulties and higher costs of the clinical management of these patients in addition to the growing rates of obesity, there is an urgent need to address this issue; however, excessive body mass is often one of the criteria that excludes obese people from trials of pharmacotherapies for the treatment of sepsis. a recent phase  <dig> trial evaluated the efficacy of the tlr- <dig> antagonist eritoran tetrasodium for the treatment of sepsis in normal weight patients . it was determined that eritoran was beneficial in patients with the highest probability of mortality  <cit> . the results presented herein demonstrating an association between tlr- <dig> expression and exacerbated inflammation in mice fed western diet suggest that targeting the tlr signaling pathway as a therapeutic approach to the medical management of sepsis may be especially beneficial in obese patients.
