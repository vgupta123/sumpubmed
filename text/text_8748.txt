BACKGROUND
alternaria brassicicola is the causative agent of black spot disease in a wide range of brassicaceae crops. the necrotrophic behavior of this fungus exposes it to several plant defense compounds such as phytoanticipins and phytoalexins  <cit>  during host colonization. brassicaceae phytoanticipins are represented by glucosinolates that are hydrolyzed by myrosinase when the plant tissues are damaged during necrotrophic colonization. brassicaceae contain a large variety of glucosinolates, each of which form different isothiocyanates  when hydrolyzed such as allyl-itc , benzyl-itc  or phenylethyl-itc   <cit> . itcs, which are the major breakdown compounds of glucosinolates  <cit> , have been shown to exert their toxicity towards a. brassicicola by oxidative stress generation  <cit> .

glutathione transferases  are a superfamily of proteins which are found widespread in animals, plants, fungi and bacteria. gsts usually catalyze glutathione  transfer onto hydrophobic molecules , or gsh removal from specific substrates   <cit> . the varieties of electrophilic compounds, which can be conjugated to gsh by gsts include aliphatic and aromatic halogen compounds, peroxides and epoxides, α, β-unsaturated and low molecular weight proteins. in particular, it has been shown that gsts are able to conjugate gsh to itc in human, arabidopsis thaliana and phanerochaete chrysosporium . in the same vein, gsts play a major role in insect adaptation to plant secondary compounds, such as glucosinolates  and itcs in the polyphagous aphid species myzus persicae  <cit> . in addition, itcs specifically induce gsts in caenorhabditis elegans, providing oxidative stress tolerance  <cit> . concerning fungal pathosystems, induction of gst encoding genes and increased transferase activity were reported in sclerotinia sclerotiorum during brassica napus infection and in the presence of itc  <cit> . moreover, some gsts have also been identified as ligandin proteins that selectively bind organic anions such as tetrapyrroles in mammals and plants  <cit> . this ligandin property has been defined as the capacity of the protein to bind non-substrate ligands  <cit> . in plants, it could be involved in intracellular transport of hydrophobic compounds such as pigments, and in temporary storage of phytohormones  <cit> . in fungi, this ligandin property has been described for members of the gstfua class in p. chrysosporium  <cit> . these enzymes are able to bind wood-derived molecules and could participate in the intracellular transport and further elimination of these compounds, which could be toxic for the cells. several gsts also play a direct role in the antioxidant response through their peroxidase activity, which reduces endogenous or exogenous hydrogen peroxides or fatty acid peroxides  <cit> . gsts can usually accept various substrates. this functional property allows them to detoxify a wide range of endogenous and environmental chemicals and is part of their evolution in response to selective pressure. in saccharomyces pombe and aspergillus fumigatus, gsts are involved in the oxidative stress response. their gene expression is induced by hydrogen peroxide . the promoters contain multiple copies of the stress response element  consensus region and the binding site of the yap <dig> transcription factor, known to modulate the adaptive response to oxidative stress or cytotoxic agents  <cit> . in yeast, the gtt <dig> gene promoter contains specific regions of the response to xenobiotics  <cit>  but gst regulation is usually the result of post-transcriptional modifications  <cit> .

the pathogenicity of a. brassicicola could be partly related to its ability to protect itself against brassicaceae defenses compounds including itc . the results obtained by  <cit>  showed that at least six genes encoding gst in a. brassicicola, were up-regulated upon exposure to itc. one of these gsts, named abgst <dig>  which is also up-regulated during interaction with the host plant has been the focus of a more detailed study  <cit> . abgst <dig> transcription was found to be significantly enhanced by heavy metals and 1-chloro- <dig> -dinitrobenzene  and the recombinant protein exhibited high glutathione transferase activity with allyl and benzyl itc as substrate as compared to cdnb. in the present study, we functionally characterized the other five itc-inducible gsts as well as the phenotype of mutants deficient for these enzymes. our results indicate that three of these gsts, belonging to the gsto, ure2pb and mapeg classes, may contribute to pathogenicity probably by protecting the fungus against the oxidative stress generated by host plant defense compounds.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of gst- coding sequences from a. brassicicola
searching the a. brassicicola genome  with glutathione transferase as keyword generated  <dig> entries. sequence analyses revealed that  <dig> of them might correspond to true gsts. a phylogenetic analysis focusing on gsts from  <dig> ascomycetes species and  <dig> basidiomycete fungus allowed the clustering of most sequences into the main previously defined classes  . a. brassicicola clearly exhibited  <dig> ure2pb sequences but no ure2pa,  <dig> efbγ,  <dig> gtt <dig>   <dig> ghr,  <dig> gsto,  <dig> gstfua and  <dig> mapeg sequences. however, attribution of the other six sequences to previously identified groups was not clear. in particular, two sequences clustered close to p. chrysosporium gtt <dig>  but their sequences contained domains related to beta or sigma gsts that are usually found in bacteria and humans, respectively. moreover, they were not related to the yeast gtt <dig> isoform. these sequences have thus not yet been classified. no member of the newly described phi class  <cit>  was found.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of ascomycete glutathione transferases. sequences from the basidiomycete phanerochaete chrysosporium were added to allow gst classification into the following classes: ure2p, gstfua, omega , glutathionyl hydroquinone reductase , efbγ, gtt <dig> and mapeg. the sequences  were retrieved from genomes of saccharomyces cerevisiae, phanerochaete chrysosporium , alternaria brassicicola, botrytis cinerea, leptosphaeria maculans, mycosphaerella figensis, mycosphaerella graminicola, neurospora crassa and stagonospora nodorum available at the joint genome institute . sequence alignments were done by clustalw and the tree was constructed with the neighbor joining method. the scale marker represents  <dig>  substitutions per residue. data available from the dryad digital repository: http://dx.doi.org/ <dig> /dryad.19f18




in a previous study, five of these gst coding genes have been found up-regulated upon exposure to itc  <cit> . based on the present phylogenetic analysis, they were renamed as follows: abgtt <dig>  , abgsto <dig> , abmapeg <dig> , abure2pb <dig>  and abgstfua <dig>  corresponding to itc-induced ests a1f <dig>  a2c <dig>  a2h <dig>  a2c <dig> and a4d <dig>  respectively  <cit>  . similarly, the previously characterized abgst <dig> from a. brassicicola  <cit>  was renamed abgtt <dig>  .table  <dig> correspondence between est, protein accession numbers and abgst names derived from the phylogenetic analysis



enzymatic activities of selected abgst proteins
recombinant abgtt <dig> , abure2pb <dig>  abgstfua <dig> and abgsto <dig> proteins were produced in escherichia coli and purified. despite several attempts to optimize the production parameters, abmapeg <dig> was always found in the insoluble fraction and could thus not be purified in its active form. the enzymatic activities of the recombinant proteins were determined using cdnb as a classical substrate for glutathione transferase assay. various itcs were also used  and peroxidase activities were tested using h2o <dig> and cumene hydroperoxide  . finally deglutathionylation activity was assayed using β-me-sg. abgtt <dig>  and abure2pb <dig> exhibited both gsh transferase with cdnb and peroxidase activity with cu-ooh. no activity was detected with h2o <dig>  abgstfua <dig> was found to be the most active protein in our tests, exhibiting significant gsh transferase activities with all itcs. abgsto <dig> exhibited a deglutathionylating activity with β-me-sg. these enzymatic profiles are in accordance with those identified within each class for other fungal species except for ure2pb <dig>  <cit> . the ure2p class was split into two subclasses . abure2pb <dig> clustered within the ure2pb subclass, however it exhibited a glutathionylation activity like the yeast isoform, which belongs to the ure2pa subclass, rather than the deglutathionylation activity previously measured for ure2pb in p. chrysposporium and e. coli  <cit> .table  <dig> kinetic parameters of abgsts in enzymatic assays

gene expression of gsts during plant infection and in response to oxidative stress
gene expression of all the selected gsts was previously shown to be itc-inducible. their expression was therefore checked during in planta interaction with brassica oleracea . genes encoding the five gsts were up-regulated compared to the control . abgtt <dig>  gene was most strongly and quickly  induced during the interaction. the maximum expression level was reached at  <dig> dpi  for most of the gsts. peak of expression was particularly marked for the genes encoding abgtt <dig>  and abgsto <dig>  overall, the transcription induction of the five selected genes occurred very rapidly during infection and remained high throughout the interaction. as itcs have been found to generate oxidative stress in fungi  <cit> , expression of the five gst genes was also recorded in fungal cultures supplemented with h2o <dig> . strong up-regulation of all the selected abgst genes was observed after 30 min exposure and then the transcripts returned to their basal level after 2 h.fig.  <dig> quantitative rt-pcr results for the expression of selected gst genes. gene expression was measured either in planta at  <dig>   <dig> and 6 day post inoculation   or in vitro in the presence of h2o <dig>  for 30 min and 2 h . for each gene, expression induction is represented as a ratio of its relative expression  in each inductive condition to its relative expression in the corresponding control. the data are the mean of three repetitions



pathogenic behavior of gst-deficient mutants in planta
virulence and aggressiveness of the gst-deficient mutants were evaluated on b. oleracea. six days after inoculation of a highly concentrated conidia suspension , usual symptoms were observed for the wild-type and mutant genotypes . at high parasitic pressure, the loss of one of the five-selected abgsts did not affect the virulence of a. brassicicola. the analysis of symptoms under lower applied parasitic pressure  revealed differences in aggressiveness between the tested genotypes . Δabgtt <dig>  and Δabgstfua <dig> mutants showed no significant difference compared to the wild-type when the inoculum was at low concentration. for ∆abgsto <dig>  ∆abmapeg <dig> and ∆abure2pb <dig> a significant decrease in aggressiveness compared to the wild-type strain was observed at  <dig> dpi. the necrotic area decreased by approximately 70 % for these mutants.fig.  <dig> pathogenic behaviour of gst-deficient mutants. b. oleracea leaves were inoculated with 5 μl drops of conidia suspension . transformants were inoculated on the right part of the central vein and compared on the same leaf with the parental strain . percentages of aggressiveness with respect to the wild-type strain were calculated at  <dig> dpi. stars indicate a significant difference with respect to the wild-type aggressiveness  using the student test 



susceptibility of gst-deficient mutants to isothiocyanates
the effects of abgst inactivation in a. brassicicola on conidia germination and initial mycelium growth in the presence of itcs were examined. an analysis of the nephelometric growth curves  revealed that under control condition , no significant phenotypic difference in conidia germination  or mycelium growth  was detected in any of the tested mutants as compared to the wild-type. in contrast, mutants deficient for abgsto <dig> and for abure2pb <dig> showed an increased susceptibility to itc compared to the wild type . in comparison, ∆abgstfua <dig> behaved like the wild-type strain and ∆abgtt <dig> , ∆abmapeg <dig> had an intermediate phenotype.fig.  <dig> nephelometric monitoring of growth of the wild-type strain and abgst deficient mutants. conidia from the wild-type and mutants were used to inoculate microplate wells containing standard pdb medium  or supplemented with ph-itc . growth was automatically recorded for 25 h at 25 °c using a nephelometric reader. each genotype was analyzed in triplicate and the experiments were repeated three times per growth condition. black circles: wild-type strain; black triangles: ∆abgtt <dig> ; white squares: ∆abgsto1; black diamonds: ∆abmapeg1; white circles: ∆abure2pb1; black squares: ∆abgstfua1




discussion
in a. brassicicola, the first characterized gst, initially called abgst <dig>  <cit>  and renamed abgtt <dig>  in the present study as it belongs to the gtt <dig> family, was shown to possess conjugation activity of al-itc or cdnb to glutathione. a more thorough examination of the a. brassicicola proteome revealed  <dig> more putative gsts that could be classified into  <dig> families according to the proposed classification. investigation of the gst content in several fungal genomes revealed a huge diversity in terms of gst number ranging from  <dig> in s. cerevisiae to more than  <dig> in saprophytic basidiomycetes  <cit> . however, the number of gsts encoded by the a. brassicicola genome was comparable to that found in other fungal necrotrophs such as botrytis cinerea , stagonospora nodorum , or hemibiotrophs such as mycosphaerella graminicola , mycosphaerella fijensis , leptosphaeria maculans . five of the a. brassicicola gsts that were previously shown to be up-regulated during itc exposure  <cit>  were clustered into five different classes, i.e. gtt <dig>  gst omega, gstfua, ure2p and mapeg.

detailed analysis of the catalytic properties of these itc-inducible gsts revealed that, besides abgtt <dig> , another gst, called abgstfua <dig>  was able to conjugate itc to glutathione. members of the fungus-specific gstfua class have been described as having ligandin properties with various small aromatic compounds and gsh transferase activity with phenetyl-itc  <cit> . this gst therefore appears to be a good candidate in protection mechanisms of a. brassicicola against host fungitoxic metabolites. however the mutant strain deficient for this enzyme was neither more susceptible to itc nor less aggressive on brassica than the wild-type and thus did not appear to be crucial for a. brassicicola pathogenicity. this could be due to a putative functional redundancy with the second isoform identified in the a. brassicicola genome. otherwise it could be due to the fact that, in presence of high itc concentrations, the efficient conjugation activity of abgstfua <dig> could result in intracellular gsh depletion, leading to overall cellular oxidative stress. indeed, zhang  <cit>  reported that itcs are presumed to penetrate human and animal cells by diffusion but once inside the cells they rapidly conjugated via their -n = c = s group with intracellular gsh. such conjugation, which takes place spontaneously but is enhanced by gst, may explain the rapid accumulation of itc within the cells  and the rapid and marked depletion of gsh observed after itc exposure  <cit> .

abgtt <dig>  is a second member of the gtt <dig> class of itc-inducible gst in a. brasiscicola. however, unlike abgtt <dig> , abgtt <dig>  was able to conjugate glutathione to cdnb but was not found to accept itcs as substrate and had a highly efficient peroxidase activity against cumene hydroperoxide. in s. cerevisiae, gtt <dig> was shown to catalyse the reduction of hydroperoxides  <cit>  and to be involved in xenobiotic detoxification  <cit> . strong in planta abgtt <dig>  gene induction was observed during fungal infection, but the ∆abgtt <dig>  mutant did not show reduced aggressiveness on its host plant or increased susceptibility to itc compared to the wild-type. as five members of the gtt <dig> class were found in a. brassicicola, the absence of a marked phenotype for the abgtt <dig> -deficient mutant suggested that these gsts have partial functional redundancies in this fungal pathogen.

by contrast with the two above-mentioned gst-deficient mutants, ∆abmapeg <dig>  ∆abure2pb <dig> and ∆abgsto <dig> mutants were highly impaired in their pathogenicity, with a severe reduction in their ability to form extended necrosis on host tissues. the two latter mutants were also found to be much more susceptible than the wild-type to itc exposure. abgsto <dig> belongs to the omega family, a member of the cysteine-containing gsts superfamily that is widespread in several kingdoms and phyla  <cit> . the conserved cysteine residue in their active site modifies their enzymatic properties as they do not catalyze conventional conjugation reactions but instead have glutathione-dependent thioltransferase activity like many other cysteine-containing gsts  <cit> . in line with its apparent protective role against itc toxicity, abgsto <dig> protein may therefore be involved in the reduction of sulfur bonds formed after reaction between itc and cysteine sulfhydryl groups of target cellular proteins, thus restoring their enzymatic functions. indeed, in human cells, itcs were found to covalently bind to multiple cysteine residues of different target proteins such as α and ß-tubulin  <cit> , toll-like receptor tlr <dig>  <cit>  or cytochrome p <dig> enzymes  <cit> .

abure2pb <dig>  as noted with abgtt <dig> , was found to function as gst and peroxidase although the measured activities were low. however, contrary to the ∆abgtt <dig>  mutant, the ∆abure2pb <dig> mutant showed increased susceptibility to itc and decreased aggressiveness compared to the wild-type strain. the first structural and biochemical characterization of a fungal ure2pb gst  was recently published  <cit> . unlike pcure2pb <dig>  abure2pb <dig> did not depict any activity in deglutathionylation tests with β-me-sg. based on our results, it is therefore difficult to come up with any convincing explanation concerning the role of this enzyme in protection against itcs and in pathogenesis, but they raise interesting questions concerning the evolution of these enzymes. it should be noted that, besides small molecules, pcure2pb <dig> was also shown to be involved in glutathionylation/deglutathionylation of proteins, particularly to interact with a gst from the omega class of p. chrysosporium, pcgsto <dig>  <cit> . as abgsto <dig> and abure2pb <dig> have comparable expression patterns and mutants deficient for these two gsts have similar phenotypes, it would be interesting to check whether these two proteins could also interact and cooperate to protect the fungal cell against itc toxicity. we have not been able to produce the soluble active form of abmapeg <dig> in a bacterial expression system. in fact, active recombinant forms of eukaryotic members of these membrane-associated gsts have mainly been obtained in yeast or baculovirus/insect expression systems  <cit> . however, careful inspection of the protein sequences derived from ab <dig>   revealed the presence of a sequence pattern similar to that described by bresell et al.  <cit>  for the mgst <dig> sub-family of microsomal glutathione transferase  and a typical mapeg hydrophobicity profile . this protein has been shown to exhibit peroxidase activity and the corresponding gene is up-regulated in p. chrysosporium in the presence of toxic oak extracts, suggesting a putative role in the oxidative stress response  <cit> . the phenotype of the mutant defective for abmapeg <dig> suggested that this protein had no function in itc detoxication while being important for full pathogenicity. examination of microarray data from a. brassicicola exposed to brassicaceous indolic phytolexins  revealed that among the  <dig> gsts,  <dig> were up-regulated in the presence of brassinin but of these only abmapeg <dig> belongs to the itc-inducible set considered in the present study. this suggests that abmapeg <dig> could be involved in brassinin tolerance during host-plant colonization.

CONCLUSIONS
three of the itc-inducible gsts were found to be essential for the normal pathogenicity of a. brassicicola. so far functional characterization of fungal gsts has mainly been performed with saprophytic model species such as a. nidulans and s. cerevisiae or wood-degrading species like p. chrysosporium. a mutant deficient for a gst  was obtained in b. cinerea but did not show any reduced virulence  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge this study therefore provided the first evidence that some gsts play an essential role in the pathogenicity of a fungal necrotroph.
