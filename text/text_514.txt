BACKGROUND
chemolithoautotrophic bacteria utilize inorganic compounds as electron donors for growth. they are subdivided into two main groups based on their electron donors: obligate lithotrophs including hydrogen-, sulphide-, sulphur-, metal-, ammonia-, nitrite- oxidizing bacteria and facultative lithotrophs such as co-oxidizing bacteria  <cit> . chemolithoautotrophic soil microorganisms contribute significantly in sequestration of the green house gas co <dig> which helps in climate sustainability and assimilate co <dig> mainly by calvin-benson-bassham  pathway. however, some chemolithotrophs such as epsilonproteobacteria have been reported to use the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle  <cit> . the crucial enzyme of the cbb cycle is ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  which occurs in four forms  <cit> . form i rubisco found in higher plants, algae, cyanobacteria and chemolithoautotrophs, is by far the most abundant enzyme in the world  <cit> . it is a bifunctional enzyme capable of fixing either co <dig> or o <dig>  it is commonly found in cytoplasm, but a number of bacteria package much of the enzyme into polyhedral organelles, the carboxysomes. these carboxysomes enhance co <dig> fixation. this enzyme is climate resilient and consists of  <dig> large and  <dig> small subunits. form i is considered to be evolved from form ii, which consists of only large subunits  <cit> . archaea contain a separate class of rubisco termed as form iii  <cit> . form iv has been found in bacillus subtilis <cit> , chlorobium tepidum <cit>  and archaeoglobus fulgidus <cit> . form iii and iv are referred as rubisco like proteins.

the large subunit of form i rubisco is encoded by cbbl-gene  <cit> . the form i rubisco is essentially found in two major forms, green like and red like, which show differences in their amino acid compositions  <cit> . the green like rubisco is divided into two types, ia and ib. form ia is found in alpha-, beta- and gammaproteobacteria and is phylogenetically allied to form ib which occurs in the chloroplasts of terrestrial plants, green algae and cyanobacteria <cit> . the red like rubisco is also divided into two relatively close forms, ic and id. form ic is found in alpha- and betaproteobacteria and many non green algae carry form id  <cit> . form ia genes are harboured by obligate and some facultative chemolithotrophs which utilize either inorganic or organic substrates  <cit> . however, there are some exceptions such as hydrogenophaga pseudoflava, oxidizing co and hydrogen but does not oxidize reduced sulphur species  <cit> . in contrast, form ic cbbl occurs in manganese-, co- and hydrogen-oxidizing facultative chemolithotrophic bacteria that potentially use heterotrophic substrate as carbon sources. a distinct form of ic cbbl sequences are also reported in a group of ammonia-oxidizing nitrosospira species  <cit> .

the phylogenetic relationships of specific functional bacterial groups by use of 16s rrna gene and a corresponding functional marker gene such as nifhamoa and dsrab have been previously studied  <cit> . in this study we used 16s rrna gene and a functional marker gene cbbl for determining phylogenetic relationships of chemolithoautotrophs. the phylogenetic affiliations based on cbbl gene are incongruent with 16s rrna gene phylogeny due to horizontal gene transfer of the cbbl-gene. nevertheless, the cbbl-gene seems to be useful for studying evolution and diversity of autotrophic organisms. this discrepancy in nature of rubisco phylogeny is only evident at higher taxonomic levels and has negligible apparent affect at lower taxonomic levels  <cit> . to date, molecular ecological studies based on rubisco genes are mostly restricted to aquatic systems  <cit>  with relatively few analysis devoted to chemolithotrophs in soil  <cit>  and fewer from extreme terrestrial systems  <cit> . thus to gain an insight into specific biochemical pathways and evolutionary relationships, cbbl and 16s rrna gene sequences were studied together in chemolithoautotrophs from coastal saline ecosystem.

in this study we report the diversity, community structure and phylogenetic affiliation of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria in two contrasting soil ecosystems i.e. agricultural soil and coastal barren saline soils using both culture dependent and independent methods. dna was extracted from bacterial isolates as well as soil samples, cbbl  and 16s rrna gene clone libraries were constructed and analyzed. the cbbl form ic sequences were most diverse in agricultural system while form ia was found only in one saline sample  which reflects the possible availability of sulphide in saline soil. this is the first comprehensive study on chemolithoautotrophs from coastal saline soil.

RESULTS
the three soils showed variations in water content, ph, salinity, organic carbon, nitrogen and sulphur contents . the agricultural soil  had electrolytic conductivity  of  <dig>  ds m- <dig> and ph  <dig>  whereas the ec and ph of saline soils  were  <dig>  ds m- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  ds m- <dig>  and ph  <dig> . total carbon level varied with high content in agricultural soil  and low content in saline soils ss <dig>  and ss <dig> . the nitrogen content was high in agricultural soil while sulphur concentration was high in saline soil ss <dig>  dna extraction from soil samples, pcr amplification and gene library construction were carried out in duplicate . a comparison of sequences from each site  revealed that the libraries displayed 90-93% similarity with each other. this was well supported by weighted unifrac environmental clustering analysis which indicated that the bacterial communities within sites were not significantly differentiated  in both cbbl and 16s rrna clone libraries. one of the clone libraries from each sample has been further analyzed.

cbbl clone libraries 
cbbl clone sequences were grouped into otus based on a cut-off of 95% sequence similarity. totals of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> form ic cbbl clone sequences were obtained from agricultural  and two saline  soils and termed bs, hs, and rs respectively. overall, the red like clone sequences yielded  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unique phylotypes for as, ss <dig> & ss <dig> clone libraries respectively. heatmap  generated by mothur program depicts the relative abundance of these phylotypes within respective clone libraries. in spite of repeated attempts to amplify and clone pcr products, only  <dig> partial form ia clone sequences were obtained from the saline soil , termed “rg clones”, and could be grouped into  <dig> otus . comparisons with the ncbi database by blast searches revealed that these otus were only distantly related to the known green-like cbbl sequences .

phylogenetic affiliation of rubisco genes
the phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbour joining method using jukes-cantor correction. a composite phylogenetic tree was generated from selected nucleotide sequences of form ic cbbl genes from all three soil samples and bacterial isolates . separate trees for as and ss <dig> & ss <dig> were also generated from aligned nucleotide sequences of form ic cbbl genes . in the composite tree, majority of the phylotypes  from different soil types did not cluster close to the cbbl sequences of known autotrophs. the sequences of cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig>  formed novel monophyletic groups not affiliated to known cbbl gene containing bacteria. some of the clone sequences clustered with cbbl sequences from known lithotrophs. otus from as soil were grouped into one site specific cluster . the phylotypes from saline soils were closely clustered within cluster  <dig>  cluster  <dig>  cluster  <dig>  cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig>  the remaining clusters  displayed random distribution of agricultural and saline soil otus, containing sequences from all three soil samples. the largest clade of the composite tree, cluster  <dig>  comprised sequences having ubiquitous distribution in all three clone libraries , and was affiliated to rhizobium leguminosarum.

in the phylogenetic tree constructed from the phylotypes of agroecosystem clone library, fifty eight otus could be classified into nine clusters with the largest clade  constituting 28% of clone library. cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig>  cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig>  were grouped together in as phylogenetic tree . cluster  <dig> and  <dig> included reference sequence from bradyrhizobium japonicum, rhizobium leguminosarum, alcaligenes, pelomonas, paracoccus and ochrobactrum anthropi. the sequences of cluster  <dig> and  <dig> formed novel monophyletic groups without showing any affiliation with known cbbl gene containing organisms and constitute the majority of clones. the phylotype bs <dig> and cluster  <dig>  constitute a branching lineage directly originating from the root not allied with any known organism. two phylotypes bs <dig> and bs <dig> were related to sulfobacillus acidophilus and formed a separate cluster with mycobacterium.

in the phylogenetic tree constructed from the phylotypes of saline soil clone libraries, seventy two otus could be assigned to eight clusters, largest cluster being clade  <dig> constituting 17% of clone libraries . the otus were phylogenetically placed with different groups of autotrophic alpha-, beta- and gammaproteobacteria which are abundant in soils. most of the otus were not closely affiliated  with rubisco sequences in the database, however, some of them were clearly related to a variety of clone sequences reported from differently managed agricultural systems, volcanic deposits, marine environments, contaminated aquifers, deltaic mobile sediments, arid and grassland soils. in the phylogenetic tree from saline soils, otus from cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig>  grouped with cbbl sequences of known cultured organisms like rhodopseudomonas palustris, oligotropha carboxidovorans, nitrosospira, rhizobium leguminosarum, salinisphaera, alcaligenes, pelomonas, paracoccus, rhodobacter, agrobacterium tumefaciens, sinorhizobium fredii and ochrobactrum anthropi . the cbbl sequences in the cluster  <dig>  were grouped with aurantimonas bacterium , methylocapsa acidiphila , bradyrhizobium japonicum  and azospirillum lipoferum . some sequences in the cluster  <dig> displayed sequence homology with nitrosospira. phylotype hs <dig> was distantly related with sulfobacillus acidophilus and mycobacterium. cluster  <dig>  showed a high intra cluster similarity not affiliated with any other known rubisco sequence and formed a monophyletic lineage with cbbl sequences of the cultured isolates  obtained from these soil samples. the phylotype r <dig> from saline soil constituted a distinct branching lineage not affiliated with any known cbbl containing cultured representative.

the form ia cbbl genes were amplified only from high saline soil . the phylogenetic analysis  revealed that the  <dig> phylotypes  were not closely associated with known sulphide, ammonia oxidizers or other taxa and formed one separate monophyletic cluster. furthermore, the form ia clone sequence rg <dig> was divergent from other form ia gene sequences.

16s rrna clone library and phylogenetic analysis
total  <dig> 16s rrna gene clone sequences were retrieved from three soil samples. the rdp classifier was used to assign 16s rrna gene sequences to the phylogenetic groups . totally  <dig> otus were identified among the  <dig> clones in the combined data set. comparative abundance of these otus was illustrated by heatmap  generated by mothur. a total of  <dig> clone sequences were analyzed from the agricultural soil , which generated  <dig> unique otus that grouped within ten bacterial phyla- proteobacteria , acidobacteria, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, chloroflexi, cyanobacteria, firmicutes, gemmatimonadetes, nitrospira and planctomycetes. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> gene sequences were analyzed from saline soils  which generated  <dig> and  <dig> unique otus respectively. these otus grouped into different bacterial phyla as described above except cyanobacteria and nitrospira. the phylogenetic trees showing the taxonomic assignment of phylotypes to different bacterial groups were constructed from the three soil clone libraries .

the detailed affiliation of different phylotypes with their closest neighbour in database is presented in additional file 4: table s <dig>  the majority of phylotypes that belong to alphaproteobacteria were from as clone library. these otus were related  to rhizobiales, sphingomonadales and rhodospirillales while six otus from ss <dig> & ss <dig> libraries showed affiliation  to rhodobacterales, rhizobiales and rhodospirillales. a cluster of  <dig> sequences from as clone library , which contributes  <dig> % of the total as betaproteobacterial population were related  to limnobacter thiooxidans from family burkholderiaceae, formed one of its largest cluster. the only ss <dig> otu hss <dig> showed 97% similarity to uncultured betaproteobacteria whereas no otu was observed in ss <dig> clone library.

the  <dig> otus  were related to different species of uncultured gammaproteobacteria. most of the ss <dig> & ss <dig> clone sequences were related to cultured bacteria like salinisphaeraceae bacterium, methylohalomonas lacus, sulphur-oxidizing bacterium and marinobacter species. the presence of sulphur-oxidizing and marinobacter bacteria in saline soils may suggest the presence of sulphur in these saline environments. these saline soils indeed contain sulphur . deltaproteobacterial otus from ss <dig> & ss <dig> clone libraries formed a tight cluster with deep sea bacterium, uncultured deltaproteobacteria and marinobacterium.

otus belonging to photoautotrophic cyanobacteria and chemoautotrophic nitrifying nitrospira were found only in as clone library. two phylotypes bss <dig> and bss <dig> were related  to cyanobacteria and uncultured nitrospira, respectively and more may be present as rarefaction curves did not reached saturation, although started to level off. the photoautotrophic chloroflexi related sequences were mostly from ss <dig> & ss <dig> clone libraries within the families caldilineaceae, sphaerobacteraceae and anaerolineaceae. one otu rs <dig> had 88% homology with sphaerobacter thermophilus, no other otus were more than 91% similar to that of any described organism . there were only two otus from as clone library which showed affiliation  to uncultured chloroflexi. van der meer et al.   <cit>  suggested that cyanobacteria and chloroflexi utilize different spectra of light, and co <dig> from the atmosphere for photosynthesis.

firmicutes related sequences were found mostly in as and ss <dig> clone library. one phylotype rs <dig> was affiliated with bacillus polygoni  a moderately halophilic, non-motile, obligate alkaliphile isolated from indigo balls. two otus rs <dig> and rs <dig> showed close relationship with halanaerobiales from which one phylotype was distantly related  to halothermothrix orenii a halophilic, thermophilic fermentative anaerobic bacterium  <cit> .

the bacteroidetes sequences were abundant in the ss <dig> clone library . two phylotypes  were related to salinimicrobium catena isolated from sediments of oil fields in the south china sea  <cit>  within flavobacteriaceae. the acidobacteria group was dominant in the as clone library and the sequences were related  to uncultured solibacter isolated from hydrocarbon contaminated soils  <cit> , and uncultured acidobacteria isolated from the heavy metal contaminated soils  <cit> . no phylotype from ss <dig> was found related to this group. planctomycetes group was represented by twelve otus , four from each soil sample. the otus from ss <dig> & ss <dig> clone libraries were related to uncultured marine bacteria and planctomyces maris .

the actinobacterial clones from as clone library were related  to micromonosporaarthrobacter globiformisstreptomyces and rubrobacter radiotolerans. eleven otus from ss <dig> & ss <dig> clone libraries clustered with uncultured actinobacteria, amycolatopsis and nitriliruptor alkaliphilus, a haloalkaliphilic actinobacterium from soda lake capable of growth on aliphatic nitriles  <cit> . overall eight otus, six from as and two from ss <dig> clone library were related  to the uncultured gemmatimonadetes bacterium. no otu was found affiliated to the gemmatimonadetes group in ss <dig> clone library. three otus from as clone library were related to the uncultured phylum op <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis of cbbl positive bacterial isolates
from a total of  <dig> bacterial isolates seven were positive for form ic cbbl genes. the positive isolates were analyzed for further study. the cbbl-gene sequences of the isolates from this study were denoted as ‘bsc’, ‘hsc’ and ‘rsc’ from as, ss <dig> and ss <dig> soil samples, respectively. the nucleotide similarities of cbbl sequences retrieved from the bacterial isolates were distantly related  to known cbbl sequences. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the isolates from this study were denoted as ‘bscs’ , ‘hscs’  and ‘rscs’ . a neighbour joining tree  was constructed from 16s rrna gene sequences of the bacterial isolates harbouring cbbl form ic gene. all seven cbbl positive bacterial isolates grouped with bacillus species. four isolates, one from each saline soil and two from agricultural soil were related to the bacillus firmus. two isolates from as showed a very high homology  with b. vireti whereas one isolate was related  to b. horikoshii. apparently, only a very limited diversity could be isolated using the single at-medium under aerobic conditions without ascorbate.

diversity indices and community structure of cbbl/16s rrna gene libraries
the parametric  and non parametric  diversity indices  indicated that the diversity of cbbl and 16s rrna gene clone libraries of as differed from ss <dig> and ss <dig> soil clone libraries. in 16s rrna gene libraries the shared otus between three soils increased significantly on decreasing the similarity cut-off. this pattern was also evident from the cbbl-gene sequence analysis. the rarefaction curve of form ic cbbl-gene sequences  did not reach an asymptote in as clone library whereas rarefaction curves reached near saturation in ss <dig> & ss <dig> clone libraries . rarefaction curves for 16s rrna gene libraries reached near an asymptote for ss <dig> and ss <dig> saline soils at the estimated phylum level 80% . the agricultural soil gene library represented non asymptotic curve at phylum level  as well as at the species level  similarity cut-off. in general, the bacterial species richness in agricultural soil was greater than saline soils as indicated by the inclines in rarefaction curves.

1otus for cbbl-gene clone libraries were determined at a  <dig>  distance cut-off and otus for 16s rrna clone libraries were determined at a  <dig>  cut-off using the mothur program. the coverage, shannon-weiner , simpson , evenness  indices and chao & ace richness estimators were calculated using the otu data.

the lack of substantial overlap between soil clone libraries suggests that bacterial communities were unique to each soil habitat. this observation was statistically supported by using libshuff , suggested that the bacterial communities retrieved from cbbl and 16s rrna analysis were significantly different from one another across the sites . the difference between homologous and heterologous coverage curves was determined by distribution of Δc as a function of evolutionary distance. our results showed significant difference between libraries with considerable Δc values at d below  <dig>  . this result suggests that differences were between closely related sequences. this conclusion was also supported by the phylogenetic trees in which the sequences from different clone libraries often group near each other but were rarely identical. we employed phylogenetic tree based comparisons, the unifrac metric, and phylogenetic p-test to cbbl and 16s rrna clone libraries. weighted unifrac environmental clustering analysis indicated that the assemblages of bacterial sequences in agricultural soil were marginally differentiated from those found in the saline soils . to determine whether the samples clustered in two dimensional spaces, pca was applied to unifrac metric. the ordination diagram  of cbbl clone libraries revealed that strongest variation in the data set was between agricultural soil and saline soils as they were separated on first axis of ordination diagram, which explains high percentage of total variation . in case of 16s rrna gene clone libraries, the first axis separated agricultural and saline soils which explain total community variability  among three sample sites .

discussion
the study of microbial diversity is crucial for the understanding of structure, function, and evolution of biological communities in order to effectively link community structure and function. we constructed multiple clone libraries for each gene  from agricultural and saline soils, which were further analyzed. form ic was highly diverse in all clone libraries while form ia could only be amplified from the high saline soil  clone library . this is in accordance with the previous work reported by nanba et al. , tolli & king  and selesi et al.   <cit> . they also found form ic cbbl sequences almost exclusively dominant in various terrestrial  systems and noted that form ia was less diverse than form ic.

this study targeted functional and phylogenetic markers together in order to reveal the metabolic potentialities of the chemolithoautotrophic bacteria at three different soil habitats. comparison of microbial populations between different soil habitats includes diversity estimation based on the expected number of otus. for the determination of relative diversity captured from each soil sample, both parametric  and non parametric  diversity indices were calculated. each diversity index is associated with the specific biases. the shannon index takes into account consistency of species abundance in otus, while the simpson’s index is sensitive to abundant otus  <cit> . chao richness is based on singletons and doubletons  <cit> , while ace is based on the distribution of abundant  and rare  species. a higher bacterial diversity was observed in the agricultural soil in comparison to the saline barren soils as revealed by shannon and simpson diversity indices and other non parametric indices . this suggests that the autotrophic bacterial distribution is likely to respond to different environmental variables such as ph, salinity, organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations etc. and the dominant populations are selected in response to changes in these variables. the soil carbon and sulphur content appears to be the major determinants of microbial community structure and function in the soil samples. but it is difficult to ascertain which particular environmental variables are driving the observed pattern of biological diversity as many of the soil and environmental characteristics are interrelated. environmental stability is important to the development and maintenance of biodiversity  <cit> . stable environments are thought to support a higher degree of organisation, more complex food webs, more niches, and ultimately more species  <cit> . our data is in agreement with these assumptions as barren coastal saline soil ecosystem does not remain stable because of tidal influx thus representing less diverse ecosystem as compared to more stable agroecosystem.

libshuff analysis of cbbl and 16s rrna clone libraries verified a large degree of variability in agricultural and saline soils in all pairs of reciprocal comparisons. the differential community structure and membership in agricultural soil as compared to the saline soils were in agreement with our expectations. a change in the community composition with increase in salinity was evident at the phylum level. microorganisms adapt to the altered salinity or they are replaced by microorganisms adapted to the changed conditions  <cit> . the replacement mechanism appears to operate at the phylum level, as changes of major groups were observed with increased salinity. however, at micro diversity level the gradual evolution and adaptation might take place   <cit> . the analysis of otus shared between three soils revealed that bacterial communities from both the saline soils were more similar than that of agriculture soil as depicted by the overlap in venn diagram of cbbl and 16s rrna gene clone libraries between the communities at species level cut-off . multiple clones from the saline soil libraries clustered together and were closely related as revealed by lineage specific analysis in unifrac.

form ic sequences were affiliated to alpha-, beta- and gammaproteobacteria for which chemolithotrophy and/or sulphur metabolism is a major mode of energy generation. in the composite tree, molecular phylogenetic analysis of cbbl clone libraries demonstrated the presence of six different novel monophyletic lineages of cbbl harbouring chemolithoautotrophic bacteria residing in the agroecosystem and saline soil clone libraries . these cbbl genes had a low sequence similarity with cbbl-types from known organisms, which indicates the sources of these cbbl genes may be yet unknown and uncultured autotrophic bacteria. the cbbl sequences fall into  <dig> clusters; one cluster as site specific, five clusters ss <dig> & ss <dig> site specific and nine clusters having cbbl-gene sequences obtained from all three sampling sites. the ubiquitous distribution of majority of the phylotypes  in the agroecosystem and saline soil clone libraries suggest a possible large scale distribution of several closely related chemolithotrophs. however, the possibility of high degree of sequence conservation and horizontal gene transfer in rubisco gene has limited the inference about taxonomic identity of closely related clones  <cit> . the saline soils phylotypes were assigned to some recognized genera like nitrosospira, paracoccus, rhodobactersalinisphaera, and many uncultured clones from differently managed agricultural systems, contaminated aquifers and deltaic mobile sediments. these sequences from saline soil clone libraries mostly belong to alpha- and betaproteobacteria. the other important members of chemolithoautotrophic community in saline soils were gammaproteobacterial autotrophs which were found predominantly in saline soil. the gammaproteobacteria are previously known to be dominated by obligate haloalkaliphiles, for example, cluster  <dig> has sequences related to the genus salinisphaera which are halophilic, aerobic, facultatively chemolithoautotrophic bacteria oxidizing co and thiosulphate  <cit> . some sequences from saline soil were related to nitrifying photoautotrophic purple non sulphur bacterium rhodobacter and denitrifying bacterium paracoccus. one phylotype was related to the aurantimonas bacterium which is facultative lithotrophic marine manganese oxidizing bacteria. the agricultural clone library phylotypes tightly clustered with different genera of alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria like rhizobium, bradyrhizobium, xanthobacter, beijerinckia, sulfobacillus, oligotropha and uncultured bacterial clones from grassland soils  <cit>  and arid soils. bradyrhizobium japonicum is a facultative chemolithoautotroph and utilizes thiosulphate and h <dig> as an electron donor and co <dig> as a carbon source  <cit> . in cluster  <dig> three phylotypes from as and one from ss <dig> clone libraries were related to sulfobacillus acidophilus  and mycobacterium of phylum actinobacteria. the form ic sequences in the agroecosystem library suggest a dominance of the facultative chemolithotrophic community like co & hydrogen oxidizing, nitrogen fixing, and plant growth promoting bacteria. none of the sequences cluster closely with nitrosospira clade, this may be due to the low abundance of ammonia oxidizers or pcr and dna extraction biases. the agricultural soil being sulphur poor system does not significantly support the sulphur/sulphide oxidizing bacterial populations.

all the cbbl positive cultured isolates were closely related to different species of the genus bacillus. a rubisco like protein , form iv rubisco was previously isolated and studied from b. subtilis and this rlp is involved in methionine pathway  <cit> . however, the form ic gene sequences from the isolates in this study are different from the form iv rlp gene ykrw of b. subtilis. recent studies suggested that rlp and photosynthetic rubisco might have evolved from the same ancestral protein  <cit> . presence of form ic genes in cultured bacillus sp. was also reported by selesi et al.   <cit> . but a clear proof, whether the bacillus isolates are completely functional autotrophs, is not yet documented. further analysis of evolutionary and functional relationships between rlps and rubisco may explain the presence of these form ic genes in bacillus.

the amplification of form ia cbbl genes in ss <dig> soil only by spiridonova et al.   <cit>  primers proves the primer selectivity bias. this could be supported by suppression of autotrophic bacterial growth by readily available carbon sources in case of agricultural soil  <cit> . role of variation in other physico-chemical properties between different sites on form ia gene diversity also cannot be underestimated. in our study, most of form ia clone sequences did not cluster closely with the sequences from known sulphide oxidizing lithotrophs. this reflects that limited attention has been paid to the role of lithoautotrophs in coastal saline environments. further isolation attempts using a variety of different media are necessary to isolate this mostly unrevealed diversity in these soils.

the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was aimed at providing further information about the total bacterial communities. if 16s rrna gene sequences were more than 95% similar to that of known autotrophic bacteria that genus is recognized for some form of chemolithoautotrophy and photoautotrophy  <cit> . sequences inferred to be from potential co <dig> fixing chemolithotrophs from groups alpha- and betaproteobacteria were highly abundant in the agricultural soil whereas gammaproteobacteria, deltaproteobacteria, actinobacteria and phototrophic chloroflexi dominated saline soils. among the betaproteobacteria two otus  were very closely related to limnobacter thiooxidans , which can grow chemolithoheterotrophically by oxidation of thiosulphate to sulphate  <cit> . one phylotype was related  to azohydromonas australica- nitrogen and hydrogen utilizing bacteria  <cit> . two otus from as clone library belonged to the phylum nitrospira, which are facultative chemolithoautotrophic nitrite oxidizing bacteria  <cit> . we also obtained one phylotype from as clone library related to the cyanobacteria, an oxygen evolving and chlorophyll containing photosynthetic bacterium. our agricultural clone libraries did not suggest an abundance of nitrite-oxidizing nitrospira and phototrophic cyanobacteria in the soil, a few sequences were identified and more may be present because the rarefaction curves  did not reach an asymptote. the gammaproteobacteria sequences in ss <dig> clone library were related to the phototrophic ectothiorhodospira, an alkaliphilic and halophilic purple sulphur bacterium from soda lake  <cit> . the phylotype hss <dig> was distantly related  to the chemolithotroph thioalkalivibrio, which oxidizes sulphide or thiosulphate with molecular oxygen. nine otus from deltaproteobacteria  fell into the order desulfovibrionales, which oxidizes reduced sulphur compounds using a variety of electron acceptors. the light penetration through soil is minimal  <cit>  however, the presence of chloroflexi  in deeper soil layers  was observed in all three soil samples. this can be justified by the fact that light of higher wavelengths has the potential to penetrate deeper into the soil  <cit> , which are used by the chloroflexi <cit> .

many of the sequences from saline soils have been previously reported from different saline environments, and the current study added significantly to the genetic pool of extreme and normal terrestrial habitats. the diversity and composition of the bacterial community along the three soil habitats varied with increase in salinity . the change in the relative proportion of the betaproteobacteria from agricultural to saline soil habitats is particularly more apparent. wu et al.   <cit>  reported that with increasing salinity, the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria decreases while that of alpha- and gammaproteobacteria increases. the low salinity of agricultural soil may, therefore, explain the high betaproteobacteria diversity in as clone library. the relative abundance of the alpha- and gammaproteobacteria does not show any systematic change. alphaproteobacteria were abundant in as clone library and gammaproteobacteria were abundant in the saline soil clone libraries . hansel et al.   <cit>  showed the inverse relationship between carbon availability and abundance of acidobacteria. however, the acidobacteria group in our study did not show such relationship. the acidobacteria sequences retrieved from the poor carbon saline soils was only  <dig> %, but they were abundant  in agricultural soil. the possible explanation for this may be the difference in other physico-chemical properties of the soils. for example, an inverse relationship between acidobacteria diversity abundance and soil ph has also been previously reported  <cit> . firmicutes related sequences were more abundant in saline soils in comparison to the agricultural soil. this predominance of firmicutes related sequences in saline soils is consistent with the previous studies. for example, the firmicutes are absent in a number of hypersaline environments  <cit>  but abundant in low salinity environments such as deep sea sediments  <cit> . chloroflexi sequences were present at each of the three sites, however, they were most abundant at barren saline soils. chloroflexi groups are the potential phototrophs and were abundant in barren soils  <cit> . this can be speculated as the saline soils provide open areas of exposed soil that can favour diverse photoautotrophic microbes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the four cbbl libraries studied in this work demonstrated the presence of highly diversified and partially unique cbbl sequences, which could belong to the possibly yet unknown potent co2-fixing bacteria. the cbbl form ia gene containing sulphide-oxidizing chemolithotrophs were found only in saline soil ss <dig> clone library, thus giving the indication of sulphide availability in this soil sample. barren saline soils favoured diverse photoautotrophic  and chemolithoautotrophic  microbial populations. the present study provides basic knowledge about the occurrence of a specific functional bacterial diversity as well as autotrophic potential of bacteria for co2-fixation through the rubisco pathway in saline coastal soils. alternative possible modes and pathways of co2-fixation were not evaluated in this survey but cannot be excluded. however, it will require further investigation including ‘metaproteomics’  <cit>  which can directly link the microbial community composition to function. identification of microbial proteins of a given habitat along with their phylogenetic affiliations will provide more comprehensive knowledge of metabolic activities occurring in microbial communities and the possible role of microbial diversity in biogeochemical processes. a better understanding of the resident bacterial communities and their functionalities in the saline barren soils should shed light on the role of barren saline soil as a possible co <dig> sink.
