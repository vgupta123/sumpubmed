BACKGROUND
gene duplication is considered the main evolutionary source of new protein functions  <cit> . although long suspected  <cit> , whole genome duplications have only been recently confirmed  <cit>  through large scale comparisons of complete genomes.

whole genome duplications are rare evolutionary transitions followed by random nonfunctionalization of many gene duplicates, resulting in characteristic reciprocal gene loss patterns  <cit> , on time scales of about  <dig> my . whole genome duplications presumably provide unique opportunities to evolve many new functional genes at once through accretion of functional domains  <cit>  from contiguous pseudogenes  and may also promote speciation events by preventing genetic recombinations between close descendants with different reciprocal gene loss patterns  <cit> .

consecutive whole genome duplications  have now been firmly established in all major eukaryote kingdoms within the last 300– <dig> my, i.e. about 10–15% of life history.

wgds have been more frequent in plants  <cit>  due to their widespread polyploidy; for instance, there were  <dig> consecutive wgds in the recent evolution of the flowering plants arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and populus trichocarpa  <cit>  while  <dig> wgds can be identified in solanum , gossypium  and brassica genomes  <cit> . overall, there were between  <dig> and  <dig> wgds in plants in the last  <dig> my and many extant species like solanum , glycine  or saccharum  have undergone a recent wgd and are still essentially pseudotetraploid plants with about twice as many gene loci as their close relatives lacking this recent wgd. they are living examples of the dramatic simultaneous changes a single wgd event produces on a genome. no other genome rearrangement is known to have a comparable immediate impact on the evolution of genomes .

successive genome duplications have also occurred in animal genomes, even though most extant species are diploids. in vertebrates , there are, for instance,  <dig> consecutive wgds between the seasquirt ciona intestinalis and the common carp, cyprinus carpio, with most tetrapods  in between at +2wgds from seasquirt and -2wgds from carp and most bony fish at +3wgds from seasquirt and -1wgds from carp  <cit> . in fact, the common carp, cyprinus carpio, and other bony fish from the salmonidae family  as well as the amphibian xenopus laevis and even the mammal tympanoctomys barrerae  are all pseudotetraploid vertebrates. [constitutive tetraploidy is even occasionally observed in humans where it is responsible for  <dig> to 2% of early miscarriages but may lead, in rare cases, to liveborn infants reaching the age of two  <cit> .

amongst invertebrates, examples of polyploid species are also suspected or confirmed in most phyla, as in annelids , flatworms , mollusks  and in the major classes of arthropods, including insects , maxillopods  and branchiopods . finally, wgds have also occured in protists; in particular, there were at least  <dig> consecutive wgds in the ciliate paramecium tetraurelia  <cit> . other wgds will likely be uncovered as more eukaryote sequences will become available.

extrapolating from these  <dig> to  <dig> consecutive wgds in the last 300– <dig> my for typical eukaryote genomes, one roughly expects a few tens consecutive wgds  since the emergence of eukaryotes, if not the origin of life itself. [while wgds do not seem readily traceable in extant prokaryote genomes, they cannot be ruled out either over long evolutionary time scales . in fact, wildtype subpopulations of bacteria with stable diploid genomes are known to exist  <cit> . in addition, viable whole genome recombinants between different prokaryotes have also been successfully engineered  <cit> .

these rare but dramatic evolutionary transitions due to whole genome duplications must have had major consequences on the long time scale evolution of large biological networks, such as protein-protein interaction  networks.

in this paper, we first discuss some experimental evidences  and expected consequences of wgds on the evolution of ppi networks. we then introduce a general model of ppi network evolution under wgd with asymmetric divergence of duplicated genes . it is first compared to datasets of direct physical interactions from yeast ppi network  and also to an alternative model with symmetric protein divergence but random link "complementation"  <cit>  ). we then redefine this initial asymmetric divergence model  in terms of protein-binding domains  to account for indirect protein-protein interaction within multi-protein complexes  and study the robustness of ppi network topology against domain shuffling of multi-domain proteins.

RESULTS
effect of wgd on ppi network evolution
a direct experimental evidence for the effect of wgd on ppi network evolution is illustrated in fig.  <dig>  it concerns the baker yeast, s. cerevisiae, which has the best available ppi network dataset  <cit>  and a well established wgd dating back about  <dig> my  <cit> . about 90% of the initial pairs of duplicated proteins from this wgd have since then undergone reciprocal gene loss, leaving about  <dig> remaining pairs in the extant genome, amongst which  <dig> have both duplicated proteins included in the available ppi network  <cit> . the latter pairs of duplicated proteins are found to be about  <dig> times more likely to share some common protein partners as compared to randomly picked pairs of proteins, while their connectivity distribution is essentially the same as other interacting proteins in the ppi network, fig.  <dig>  this demonstrates that at least some of the duplicated interactions that were necessary present immediately after wgd have not been lost in the course of  <dig> my of evolution, despites the divergence of the corresponding duplicated pairs and all their  shared partners. the same trend has also been reported when considering protein pairs with a significant sequence homology  <cit> . this direct experimental evidence for the effect of wgd on ppi network evolution is even more compelling when considering protein pairs sharing more than one partner in the ppi network; for instance, duplicated pairs from this  <dig> my-old wgd are about  <dig>  times more likely to share  <dig> or more partners as compared to randomly picked pairs of the ppi network, fig.  <dig> 

from a more theoretical point of view and on longer evolutionary time scales , we also expect that alternating wgds and extensive gene deletions lead to exponential dynamics of ppi network evolution. in the long time limit, this should outweigh all time-linear dynamics that have been assumed in ppi network evolution models so far  <cit>  . in fact, the prevailing exponential dynamics of genome evolution is already clear from the wide distribution of genome sizes  <cit>  and proliferation of repetitive elements  <cit> : it is hard to imagine that the 104-fold span in lengths of eukaryote genomes could have solely arisen through time-linear increases  in genome sizes. .

overview of the model
we propose a simple model of ppi network evolution focussing on the effect of whole genome duplication . in the present model, each time step n corresponds to a whole genome duplication and leads to a complete duplication of the ppi network, whereby each node is duplicated  and each interaction quadruplated  as depicted on fig.  <dig> <cit> . hence, the model considers discrete time steps corresponding to wgd events. natural selection is then modeled statistically, that is regarless of specific evolutionary advantages, at the level of duplication-derived interactions . concretely, links from the duplicated network are assumed to be stochastically preserved  with different probabilities γi  reflecting the divergence of protein duplicates. in principles, these probabilities γi might vary  <cit>  at each wgd event and between different proteins, but we will focus in this paper on the simplest relevant model based on the asymmetric divergence of duplicated genes following genome duplication. for each pair of duplicated genes, one copy, referred to as the "old" duplicate, diverges more slowly and retains many of the interactions of the parent gene, while the other copy, referred to as the "new" duplicate, diverges more rapidly and looses many of its duplication-derived interactions. at each wgd steps, the asymmetry between "old" and "new" duplicates defines three interaction divergence parameters: γo, the probability to preserve duplication-derived interactions between pairs of slowly diverging "old" duplicates; γn, the probability to preserve duplication-derived interactions between pairs of rapidly diverging "new" duplicates and γ, the probability to preserve duplication-derived interactions between pairs involving one "old" and one "new" duplicates, see fig.  <dig>  in practice, interactions between slowly diverging "old" partners are much more likely to be preserved than those involving one or all the more two rapidly diverging "new" partners, i.e.  <dig> ≃ γo ≫ γ ≫ γn ≃  <dig>  "old" and especially "new" duplicates that loose all their interactions with previous partners are then eliminated from the ppi network, while the "old" and "new" labels of selected duplicates are eventually all reset  before the next wgd iteration. hence, "old" and "new" labels are only transient notations reflecting the asymmetric divergence of duplicated pairs after each wgd event .

the ppi network evolution resulting from these successive wgds is first solved analytically in the asymptotic limit of large ppi networks and then numerically for comparison with the available data on the yeast ppi network. finally, an extension of this model is proposed to include the role of protein domains and their extensive shuffling between multidomain proteins over long evolutionary time scales.

asymmetric divergence of duplicated proteins
in the following, we consider a general model of ppi network evolution under wgd which allows for asymmetric divergence of duplicated proteins, fig.  <dig>  symmetric divergence of duplicate proteins corresponds to a particular case of divergence with vanishing asymmetry and is discussed in the supporting information in the context of an alternative model based on symmetric duplication-divergence processes with link "complementation"  <cit> .

actually, asymmetric divergence between duplicated genes is well supported by the reciprocal gene loss patterns arising after wgd  <cit> ; this demonstrates that many, if not most, of the initially duplicated genes are eventually retained as single genes in the duplicated genome, reflecting clearly the asymmetric fate of duplicated genes after wgd . indeed, while duplicated genes are initially equivalent and experience, at first, the same functional constraints  <cit> , their divergence becomes eventually asymmetric  <cit> . this occurs as one duplicate is more constrained to retain "old" interactions, while the other duplicate is less constrained and thus accumulates more mutations with the likely outcome to become nonfunctional by loosing all its duplication-derived interactions, unless some of them are eventually retained by selection. note that the only interaction changes considered in this model are deletions of duplication-derived interactions . as outlined in the model overview above, divergence asymmetry is introduced by assigning different evolutionary parameters γo and γn in between "old" or "new" duplicated nodes corresponding to a larger and lower chance to conserve instances of their parent-node interactions, fig.  <dig>  duplication-derived interactions arising between different "old" and "new" duplicates are retained with probability γ. note that "old" and "new" labels in fig.  <dig> refer to the asymmetric conservation and fate of duplicates after wgd . functionalization patterns of duplicated genes are further discussed in additional file  <dig> 

we have solved this mathematical model of ppi network evolution under wgd illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the theoretical approach detailed in methods relies on asymptotic methods applied to a functional recurrence relating successive normalized generating functions p of the ppi network degree distribution, eq.  <dig>  we outline here, from a biological perspective, the main conclusions of this exact analytical approach. the main results only depend on the following two combinations of evolutionary parameters, Γo = γo + γ and Γn = γn + γ, which correspond to the average rates of connectivity change between successive wgds, k → kΓi, for each type of duplicates, i = o, n. we assume Γo ≥ Γn by definition of the more conserved  and less conserved  duplicates, respectively. hence, the connectivity of the most conserved duplicates decreases or increases as kΓom

• non-conserved, exponential regime
the case Γo <  <dig>  implies an exponentially decreasing degree distribution, pk ∝ exp for large k ≫  <dig>  corresponding to a regular, infinitely derivable generating function, p. from an evolutionary perspective, we find that this exponential topology arises while the links emerging from each node  are more likely lost than duplicated at each round of global duplication . this implies that most nodes eventually disappear, and with them all traces of network evolution, after just a few rounds of global duplication. the network topology is not conserved, as anticipated above, but instead continuously renewed from duplication of the  most connected nodes. from a speciation perspective, this implies that all nodes of a given ppi network realization are eventually more closely related to one another than to any other node of a different ppi network realization, i.e. from a different species. clearly, this class of evolutionary non-conserved ppi networks doest not appear to be biologically relevant, given the typical degree of conservation between orthologous proteins across living kingdoms. as a consequence, we can also conclude from the phase diagram fig. 3a that exponential ppi networks arising through genome duplication would necessary correspond to non-conserved networks and would thus be presumably irrelevant from a biological perspective. this result actually holds, beyond genome duplication, for evolutionary duplication-divergence dynamics at any genomic scale  and even with variations in all evolutionary parameters {γi}

in summary, whole genome duplication with asymmetric divergence of duplicated proteins leads to the emergence of two main classes of ppi networks : i) ppi networks with an exponential degree distribution and without protein nor topology evolutionary conservation and ii) ppi networks with a scale-free limit degree distribution and protein conservation together with at least some local topology conservation. all other evolution scenarios are unlikely to model biologically relevant cases; they correspond either to an exponential disappearance of the whole ppi network  or to an exponential shift of all proteins towards higher and higher connectivities, i.e. dense regime in fig. 3a, see methods and  <cit> . note, in particular, that the evolution of ppi networks with symmetric divergence under wgd, i.e. Γo - Γn =  <dig> in fig. 3a, cannot lead to biologically relevant, conserved ppi networks with scale-free topology; indeed, wgd followed by symmetric divergence of duplicated genes leads either to non-conserved exponential ppi networks  or to nonstationary dense ppi networks . besides, the same conclusion applies for an alternative model of ppi network evolution under wgd and "link complementation", see additional file  <dig>  hence, asymmetric divergence of duplicated genes under wgd is required to obtain a  conserved ppi networks. yet, we will argue, below, that such divergence asymmetry arises, in fact, spontaneously at the level of protein-binding domains. this will support a refined model of ppi network evolution in terms of protein domains rather than entire proteins.

fitting ppi network data with a one-parameter model
scale-free degree distributions have been widely reported for large biological networks and other exponentially growing networks like the www. we showed in the previous discussion that scale-free limit degree distributions require an asymmetric divergence of duplicated proteins  which corresponds to the probability difference between conservation of old interactions  and coevolution of new binding sites . the expected range of parameters for actual biological networks is  <dig> ≃ γo ≫ γ ≫ γn ≃ 0; in particular, the most conservative  and least correlated  evolution scenario corresponds to the strongest divergence asymmetry between duplicated proteins . the condition γo =  <dig> ensures that not only local but also global topologies of all previous networks remain embedded in all subsequent networks. this model is effectively a one-parameter model  for ppi network evolution through whole genome duplication. it converges towards a stationary scale-free limit degree distribution pk ~ k-α- <dig> with  <dig> <α <  <dig> for  <dig> <γ < / <dig> and generates non-stationary dense networks for / <dig> <γ <  <dig>  <cit> . we used this one-parameter model to fit both the degree distribution  and the average connectivity of first neighbors  for direct physical interaction data of s. cerevisiae taken from two databases, bind  <cit>  and mips  <cit> . bind data mainly comes from high throughput two-hybrid techniques, while mips data is primarily based on hand curated, litterature references . the predicted asymptotic regime is in fact approached for k ≤  <dig> due to the finite size of yeast ppi network. note, in particular, that both scale-free degree distribution  and protein hub repulsion  are simultaneously predicted with a single fitting parameter γ =  <dig> . this corresponds to a fixed growth rate Γo + Γn =  <dig> + 2γ =  <dig>  .

adding and removing up to 30% of links randomly, or drawing γ from a uniform distribution between  <dig> and  <dig>   yield remarkably similar fits  to the experimental data. this reveals a large insensibility to false- positive and negative noises and fluctuations in γ . the fixed  growth rate of 52% at each round of global duplication is enough to generate networks of the size of s. cerevisiae starting from a few interacting "seeds" after about  <dig> global duplications . such scenario is not a priori incompatible with experimental data, as we only have clear records on global duplications dating back up to 400– <dig> my ago . yet, these records suggest that "recent" whole genome duplications might be more frequent  and more selective .  we will show, however, below, that this discrepancy is essentially resolved by redefining ppi network evolution in terms of protein binding domains instead of entire proteins. this will also provide a theoretical framework to account for both direct and indirect protein-protein interactions within multiprotein complexes.

direct vs indirect protein-protein interactions
the protein-protein interactions we have considered so far correspond to direct physical contact between protein pairs derived, for instance, from two-hybrid expression assays  <cit> . however, we expect from the proposed scale-free fit of the degree distribution  that the underlying ppi network has conserved not only pairwise interactions during evolution but also some level of network topology . the emergence of locally conserved topology in ppi network evolution leads "naturally" to conserved associations or "modules" between multiple proteins  <cit>  and, beyond, to recurrent "motifs" across different types of biological networks  <cit> .

in fact, many biological functions are known to rely on multiple direct and indirect interactions within protein complexes. moreover, the combinatorial complexity of multiple-protein interactions is likely responsible for the remarkable diversity amongst living organisms  <cit> , despite their rather limited and largely shared genetic background  thousands genes built from a few hundreds families of homologous protein domains  <cit> ).

high-throughput studies using affinity precipitation methods coupled to mass spectroscopy  <cit>  have proposed some  <dig>  direct and indirect protein interactions for s. cerevisiae  and similar data are now becoming available for several other species.

yet, from a theoretical point of view, the evolution of indirect interactions is expected to depend not only on locally conserved network topology but also on the actual "combinatorial logic" between direct interactions  <cit> . this cannot be readily defined on traditional ppi network representation  and requires a somewhat more elaborate model as we now discuss.

redefining ppi network evolution in terms of protein domains
indirect protein interactions reflect the occurence of simultaneous direct interactions within protein complexes. this requires that some proteins have more than one binding sites to simultenaously interact with several protein partners. indeed, proteins with a single protein-binding site can only bind to one partners at a time, underlying a simple "xor"-like combinatorial logic. by contrast, proteins with several protein-binding sites greatly increase the combinatorial complexity of biological processes  by adding "and" operators to the computational logic between multiple direct interactions.

in addition, we note that binding sites are likely the primary source of asymmetric divergence in ppi network evolution, as mutations on a shared binding site will generally affect the interactions with all its binding partners  and not just a random subset of them . hence, asymmetric divergence of binding site duplicates "naturally" results from "spontaneous symmetry breaking" due to the intrinsic evolutionary coupling of interactions sharing a common binding site. yet, this argument of spontaneous symmetry breaking only applies to individual binding sites, not to entire proteins. indeed, while the divergence of individual binding sites should be inherently asymmetric, this does not have to be the case a priori at the level of entire proteins with multiple binding sites. this is because, in principles, distinct binding sites of a protein are not necessarily coupled, thereby enabling them to evolve somewhat independently and to eventually lead, after gene duplication, to a partition of the most conserved binding site copies between each protein duplicates . structural independence of binding sites is expected, in particular, for proteins with multiple binding sites located on different protein domains. in this case, the evolutionary symmetrization of multidomain proteins should even be further enhanced by extensive shuffling of protein domains over broad evolutionary scales  <cit> . yet, we will demonstrate below that even a strong symmetrization of protein divergence at the level of protein domains, corresponding to a complete random shuffling of protein domains, is not suffcient to prevent the emergence of scale-free ppi networks, by constrast to predictions for symmetric models at the level of individual interactions .

in the following, we propose to highlight this central role of protein domains in the evolution of ppi networks by simply redefining our initial asymmetric divergence model  in terms of protein-binding domains, and assuming at first a single protein-binding site per protein-binding domain, as illustrated in fig. 4a . in particular, the normalised generating function p introduced previously, eqs., now corresponds to the connectivity distribution of individual protein-binding domains, instead of entire proteins. this alternative representation of ppi networks provides a theoretical framework to model the evolution of the combinatorial logic underlying ppi networks, as it distinguishes mutually exclusive, direct interactions  between protein domains  from cummulative, indirect interactions  within multi-protein complexes .

combining whole genome duplication and extensive domain shuffling
as noted in the introduction, whole-genome duplications is thought to promote efficient shuffling of multi-domain proteins by enabling many accretion and deletion events of functional domains after each genome doubling. in fact, we will assume in the following that the overall shuffling of multi-domain proteins is so efficient that protein domains encoded along the genome are effectively randomly shuffed over long evolutionary time scales, e.g. >  <dig> my- <dig> gy, as suggested by the different multi-domain combinations typically observed across distant living kingdoms  <cit> ).

indeed, our aim, here, is not to model the fine details of domain shuffling events on short evolutionary time scales, but instead to check the robustness of ppi network scale-free topology against the extensive shuffling of protein domains that effectively occurs over long evolutionary time scales. assuming a random shuffling of individual protein domains implies that their evolutionary dynamics is ultimately averaged over a long series of single- and multi-domain proteins. hence, the integrated connectivity of individual protein domains can be assumed to have evolved independently from their current position inside a specific single- or multi-domain protein. besides, a more elaborate model of protein evolution detailing domain accretion and deletion events leads to virtually identical asymptotic results .

assuming a random shuffling of independent protein domains over long evolutionary time scales is also a more stringent condition with regards to the robustness of ppi network topology against domain shuffling events. the overall topology of ppi networks is expected to be a forceriori less affected by actual domain shuffling events.

finally, the assumption of random shuffling of independent protein domains is simple enough to be amenable to an exact mathematical extension of the initial model neglecting multidomain protein structures. indeed, in the asymptotic limit, the generating function for the connectivity distribution of the global multidomain protein network, p^

hence, domain shuffling of multi-domain proteins provides a powerful, yet non-disruptive source of combinatorial innovation, as it preserves essential topological features inherited from the underlying protein-domain interaction network evolution.

finally, comparison with experimental data sets including indirect protein-protein interactions  <cit>  is made by adopting a statistical implementation of the "combinatorial logic" discussed above . it is based on a dijkstra algorithm that estimates the relative importance of all possible indirect interactions between multi-domain  proteins for each ppi network realization. figs. 4b &4c show rather good fits of experimental data sets corresponding to an estimated 30% to 60% coverage of actual ppi networks  <cit>  . the two adjusted parameters, γ =  <dig>  and λ =  <dig> , correspond to a network growth rate of 20%  and an average of  <dig>  ) protein-binding sites  per protein in agreement with broad estimates for these biological parameters . this also confirms that the properties of ppi networks we have predicted from first principles  exponential dynamics and ii) symmetry breaking) are already transparent from partial data sets.

discussion
in this paper, we establish the statistical consequences of successive whole genome duplications and divergence asymmetry between gene duplicates on both i) evolutionary conservation and ii) emerging topological properties of ppi networks. the evolutionary dynamics of non-conserved networks implies that all evolutionary traces are erased exponentially fast from the network and its underlying genome over typical wgd time scales . hence, evolutionary conserved networks are presumably the only biologically relevant ppi networks that may arise through whole genome duplications. we have also demonstrated that they necessarily present a scale-free topology that is robust to extensive domain shuffling of their multiple domain proteins.

other evolutionary processes than wgd and domain shuffling have not been included in the main text above, for simplicity. yet, additional ppi network features can also be taken into account. we have investigated, in particular, the roles of  <dig> additional well-documented features of ppi network evolution, which we discuss below. they are i) protein homo-oligomerization, ii) protein domains with multiple binding sites and, finally, iii) other duplication-divergence events at smaller genomic scale than entire genome . yet, we have found that none of these additional ppi network features significantly affect the general conclusions of the present study.

• i) protein homo-oligomerization
the possibility of protein homo-oligomerization can be explicitly taken into account by introducing  <dig> types of nodes corresponding respectively to i) self-interacting proteins with self-link loops and ii) non-self-interacting proteins without self-link loops, see fig. s <dig> and supporting information. available data on ppi networks reveals that about  <dig> to 15% of interacting proteins are self-interacting  <cit> . empiral evidence have also been reported on the higher overall connectivity and interconnectivity of homodimer proteins in ppi networks  <cit> . in principle, the detailed evolution of ppi network conservation and topology is affected by self-link loops which provide a source of duplication-derived de novo interactions between "old" and "new" copies of duplicated self-interacting proteins, fig. s <dig>  however, the general conservation and topological properties of ppi networks turn out to be little affected by the presence of self-link loops, in the asymptotic limits of large ppi networks and large node degrees . in a nutshell, this is because conservation and topology of ppi networks are controlled by the exponential increase of their node degrees while the contribution of de novo interactions arising from duplicated self-interacting proteins can at most lead to a linear increase of node degrees, with a maximum increment of + <dig> link per duplication event and protein. thus, although an abundance of self-interacting proteins would significantly affect the evolution of low connectivity proteins, it could not lead to a change of topological regimes for the highly connected nodes of the ppi networks . hence, to a first approximation, self-interacting proteins can be simply ignored to establish the asymptotic conservation and topology regimes of ppi network evolution, as we have done in the main text and fig. 3a. note, however, that the actual power law exponents of scale-free node degree distributions might nonetheless be affected by de novo interactions arising from duplicated self-interacting proteins . in addition, self-link loops might also be important for the evolution of certain network motifs whose initial emergence might precisely depend on the presence of self-interacting proteins .

• ii) protein domains with multiple binding sites
the possibility of having protein interfaces involving more than two proteins at a time  is not currently included in the model. actually, the average number of binding sites per protein-binding domains is around  <dig> , with about 80% of protein-binding domains having a single binding site  <cit>   yet, in principle, the evolution of protein-binding domains with multiple binding sites can be taken effectively into account, at least numerically, by introducing a strong physical correlation between successive single-binding-site "domains". however, we want to stress that our main results regarding protein-binding domains do not concern nor rely on the detailed evolutionary correlation of binding sites and domain shuffling mechanisms. indeed, by assuming only single-binding-site domains, we have demonstrated that even the most extensive shuffling of binding site/domain orders, implying the loss of all correlation along the primary sequence, does not qualitatively affect the general conservation and topological properties of emerging ppi networks under whole genome duplications. hence, it is quite clear and confirmed by simulations  that introducing physical correlation between successive binding sites/domains has a forceriori even less effect on the general evolutionary regimes, we have predicted above.

• iii) duplication-divergence events at smaller genomic scales
finally, beyond whole genome duplication, duplication-divergence events are also known to occur at smaller genomic scales from single gene to partial genome duplication. moreover, local duplications/deletions may also lead to exponential dynamics of ppi network evolution if they are selected independently in parallel. a general model for ppi network evolution under duplication-divergence processes at any genomic scale  and allowing also for variations in all evolutionary parameters {γi}

interestingly, recent evolutionary records  for specific eukaryotes from various kingdoms, e.g.  <cit> , suggest that whole genome duplications have been a significant factor in the overall expansion of ancestral genomes  <cit> , while local duplications have been mainly responsible for the expansion of specific gene families. it will be interesting to see whether this is a general trend or not as new complete eukaryote sequences will become available.

this difference in typical selection pattern of gene duplicates from either whole genome or local duplications may possibly reflect their opposite dosage effects on cellular activity and ultimately correspond to two evolutionary paradigms reminiscent to monod's "chance and necessity" principles  <cit> . indeed, random local duplications of essential genes are thought to be generally detrimental by the dosage imbalance they initially induce, thereby raising the odds for their rapid nonfunctionalization  <cit> , unless they specifically happen to be beneficial under concomitant environmental changes  <cit> . hence, the typical fate of random local duplications might be primarily driven by immediate "necessity" rather than "chance" and eventually lead to the expansion of specific gene families through series of beneficial local duplications. by contrast, rapid nonfunctionalization of duplicates following a whole genome duplication should be typically opposed by dosage effect, in particular, for highly expressed genes and for genes involved in multiprotein complexes or metabolic pathways  <cit> . this is because whole genome duplications initially preserve correct relative dosage between expressed genes, while subsequent random nonfunctionalizations disrupt this initial dosage balance.

preventing rapid asymmetric divergence between duplicates from recent whole genome duplications appears, in the end, to increase their chance of neo- or subfunctionalization by favoring longer genetic drift rather than early functional loss. hence, by contrast with local duplications, the typical fate of gene duplicates under whole genome duplication might be largely driven by  chance rather than  necessity. it is also reflected in the random pattern of reciprocal gene loss associated with multiple speciation events that typically follow a whole genome duplication  <cit> . this prevalence of chance over necessity following whole genome duplications further supports the stochastic and statistical framework we have adopted here to model the evolution of ppi networks under whole genome duplication.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we argue that, large scale topological features of ppi networks emerge spontaneously in the course of evolution under simple duplication/deletion events  <cit> , regardless of the specific evolutionary advantages individual proteins might have been selected for. while other selection drives than mere protein domain conservation might have also played a role, they do not appear to have been necessary nor prevailing factors to shape the large scale topology of ppi networks. for instance, the repulsion of protein hubs into largely independent network modules  is predicted here  without any specific selection pressure being ever invoked in favor of such network motifs. yet, we showed that the exponential dynamics of ppi network evolution under genome duplication requires an asymmetric divergence of protein duplicates. such asymmetric divergence arises, however, "naturally" at the level of protein-binding sites or domains  and is robust to extensive domain shuffling of multi-domain proteins.

from a more general perspective, the context of accelerating genome sequencing projects calls for a broader and inevitably more statistical understanding of biological network evolution, beyond the accumulation of details for particular evolutionary transitions of specific species. the analysis of ppi networks over broad evolutionary scales can only be based on a few well-established evolutionary mechanisms shared across a wide variety of organisms. as novel whole genome duplications are now routinely discovered in newly sequenced eukaryote genomes, e.g.  <cit> , it is clear that these rare but dramatic simultaneous changes in genome content must have had a major impact on the long time scale evolution of eukaryote genomes and, hence, resulting biological networks. this study demonstrates the expected biological implications of such successive genome duplications in terms of both conservation and topology of ppi networks. in particular, it shows from first principles, that scale-free topologies of ppi networks are a simple consequence of their evolutionary conservation. it also highlights the importance and origin of the divergence asymmetry between gene duplicates, as well as the overall robustness of the resulting scale-free topology to domain shuffling of multi-domain proteins.
