BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus has long been recognized as a major human pathogen responsible for a wide range of infections, from mild skin infections to wound infections and bacteraemia  <cit> . although the introduction of antibiotics has lowered the mortality rate from s. aureus infections, the bacteria have developed resistance mechanisms to all antimicrobial agents that have been produced  <cit> .

despite antibiotic therapy, staphylococcal infections occur regularly in hospitalized patients and have severe consequencess  <cit> . due to an increasing number of infections caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus  strains, which are now most often multiresistant, therapy has become problematic  <cit> . since this organism can spread easily by direct or indirect contact between patients and the environment, or among patients and medical personnel, s. aureus is an important cause of nosocomial infection, and major outbreaks are common  <cit> .

dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes by horizontal gene transfer has led to the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria, thus complicating the treatment of infections  <cit> . acquired resistance evolves via horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes located on various types of mobile dna elements. a key system involved in spreading antibiotic multiresistance is the integron, an element that, although normally immobile itself, can be transferred through mobile genetic elements  <cit> . integrons are genetic elements that incorporate exogenous open reading frames by recombination and convert them to functional genes  <cit> . all integrons characterized to date are composed of these major elements: a gene  encoding an integrase; a primary recombination site ; and an outward orientated promoter  that directs transcription of the captured genes  <cit> .

in this study, the presence of integrons and gene cassettes in s. aureus has been studied for the first time in iran.

the objective of this research was to identified multiple drug resistance in clinical isolates of s. aureus by antibiotic sensitivity testing, detection of meca gene for methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, and distribution of class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons and associated gene cassettes among s.aureus isolates collected from clinical sources in tehran by pcr assays and investigates associations between multidrug resistance and the existence of integrons.

methods
sampling and bacterial isolation
one hundred and thirty nine s. aureus isolates were collected from hospitals in tehran, over a six month period, starting from the first of october  <dig> till the end of march  <dig> . the isolates were recovered from wounds , blood , urines , nasal swabs , catheters , sternum samples , sputa , eyes , csf , synovial fluid , throat samples  and abscesses . the isolates were identified as s. aureus by standard biochemical tests for catalase, coagulase, clumping factor, dnase, and thermostable nuclease. all isolates were also evaluated for the presence of the sa <dig> gene by pcr  <cit> . the research was approved by the ethics committee of the pasteur institute of iran  and acquire either verbal or written informed consent from the patients to take their samples for this study.

antibiotic susceptibility test
the isolated s. aureus strains were tested for their in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility using the disk diffusion technique on mueller- hinton agar . the results were recorded after 18 h of incubation at 37єc. antimicrobial drugs tested included penicillin g; pg, amoxicillin; a, linezolid; lzd, streptomycine; s, ampicillin; ap, tetracycline; t, chloramphenicol; c , sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; sxt, amikacin; ak, azithromycin; ath, spectinomycin; spc, gentamicin; gm, vancomycin; va, teicoplanin; tec, ciprofloxacin; cip, oxacillin; ox, levofloxacin; lev, gatifloxacin; gat, rifampin; rp, erythromycin; e, ceftriaxone; cro, tobramycin; tn, clindamycin; cd . the mic to vancomycin was determined by etest . enterococcus faecalis atcc  <dig> and enterococcus faecium bm <dig> were used as controls for vancomycin susceptibility and vancomycin resistance, respectively. the breakpoints for antibiotic susceptibility were determined according to the guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute   <cit> . e. coli atcc  <dig> was used as a reference control strain. isolates of s.aureus that show resistance to three or more than three classes of antibiotics, considered as multidrug – resistant strains.

the extraction of s. aureus plasmid and genomic dna
the genomic dna preparation used in this study was performed following sambrook et al.  <cit> . the dna was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated by ice-cold ethanol. the dna pellet was washed with 70 % ethanol and resuspended in 50 μl of te buffer  and stored at -20єc until used and 1 μl of the suspension were used as the template dna for pcr. using the primers determined  <cit>  meca gene was detected by pcr. size of the amplified fragment was 533 bp.

the qiagen plasmid midi kit was used for the s. aureus plasmid dna extraction; the manufacturer’s instructions were followed.

detection of class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons
all isolates were screened for detection of class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons by the primers described by moura et al.  <cit>  designed for the inti <dig> and inti <dig> genes respectively. primers inti <dig> f/r and inti <dig> f/r were used to amplify 280 bp and 232 bp fragments, respectively. the amplification program was performed by termocycler  and started with initial denaturation of 4 min at 94 °c and programmed wi th 35 cycles of each: 1 min at 94 °c, 30 s at 55 °c, 1 min at 72 °c. the program finished with the final extension of 10 min at 72 °c.

mapping of class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons
the gene cassettes inserted in the variable regions of class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons  were amplified using the primer pairs introduced by moura et al.  <cit> .

sequencing of amplified integron gene cassettes
for each pcr product that had a unique size when visualized on the gel, a number of samples of the post-pcr mixture was processed with the high pure pcr product purification kit  and used for direct sequencing. the purified amplicons were sequenced using the abi capillary system . resulting sequences were assembled by using seqman program within the lasergene suite version  <dig> . potential open reading frames  were predicted by using the ncbi  orf finder tool . blast  against genbank database and the integron database integrall  were performed repeatedly for sequence comparison and annotation.

statistical analysis
the antibiotic resistance data between integron-positive isolates and integron-negative isolates was compared and the χ <dig> test was used to calculate the p value in terms of resistant and susceptible numbers by spss version  <dig> software. a p value of < <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

discussion
in the current study, prevalence of inti  <dig> and inti  <dig> were examined among multidrug resistant s.aureus strains, isolated from different specimens. the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pathogens has become a major public health concern  <cit> . horizontal gene transfer has already been proved a significant mechanism for disseminating antimicrobial resistance in bacterial populations. antimicrobial drug resistance can also be facilitated by integrons in case of many other bacteria . since the integrons were detected first in gram-negative bacteria, many studies have been conducted on gram-negative bacteria. although the role of class 1integrons is well known in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in gram-negative bacteria, much less is known about gram-positive bacteria and very few studies have reported the presence of class  <dig> integrons in gram-positive bacteria so increasing antibiotic resistance mediated by integrons in gram-positive bacteria has become a great concern in the medical field  <cit> .

integrons are genetic elements able to recognize and capture mobile gene cassettes carrying antibiotic resistance genes leading to mdr distribution and subsequently limitation of treatment options for infections  <cit> .

to our knowledge, this is the first study to report carriage of class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons and associated gene cassettes in s.aureus isolates from iran. our findings demonstrate that integrons are widespread among s.aureus clinical isolates in tehran. most resistant pattern was observed in amoxicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, tobramycin, streptomycine, spectinomycin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycine, penicillin g, clindamycin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone and antibiotic such as vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were considered as the most effective drugs against s.aureus strains that this results largely agrees to findings of xu et al. about amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, oxacillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and the result of ren et al. about oxacillin, erythromycin, azithromycin, clindamycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, gentamycin  <cit> .

among different classes of integrons, class  <dig> integrons have been found more frequently in different species of bacteria, especially gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . the classification of different integrons is mainly based on differences in the gene structure of integrases  <cit> .

in this survey, presence of integrons in strains of s.aureus as compared to similar studies conducted by xu et al. and ren et al. has been increased  <cit> . the rate of detection of integron class  <dig> was more than integron class  <dig>  one hundred and one  isolates were positive for class  <dig> integron and  <dig>  isolates were positive for class  <dig> integron.

the nine different cassettes arrangements wich class  <dig> integrons and another three arrangements within class  <dig> integrons were identified.

twelve different gene cassettes were detected. cassette genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides were found to be predominant in the class  <dig> integron. the aadb and aada types genes that encode resistance to aminoglycosides  were most commonly found  <cit> .

the b-lactamase cassettes  that confer resistance to oxacillin and ampicillin  <cit> , were found in three isolates with amplicon size 1200 bp. the aaca <dig> cassette  that confer resistance to gentamicin, amikacin and tobramycin, was found with amplicon size 800 bp  <cit> .

the dfr cassettes  that confer resistance to trimethoprim, were also detected frequently. the sat <dig> cassette confers resistance to streptothricin by encoding a streptothricin acetyltransferase  <cit> .

the diversity of gene cassettes inserted in ivrs of class  <dig> integrons is much lower than class  <dig> integrons. this reduction in diversity is probably owing to a nonsense mutation in codon  <dig>  in the integrase gene of class  <dig> integrons, thereby yielding a truncated, non-functional protein, the resultant integrase is therefore unable to excise existing cassettes or insert new ones  <cit> .

phenotypic and genotypic characterizations of integrase-positive s.aureus are shown in table  <dig>  ninety percent  of class  <dig> and  <dig>  %  of class  <dig> integrons harboured at least one gene cassette. eleven arrays were detected containing one to three cassettes, out of which eight distinct arrays were present in integrons of class  <dig> and three arrays in class  <dig> integrons. common gene cassettes arrays were identified in s.aureus strains. in comparison with other sequences deposited in databases, the following gene cassettes were identified: gentamicin, tobramycin and kanamycin resistance genes , gentamicin, amikacin and tobramycin resistance genes , streptomycin and spectinomycin resistance genes , trimethprim resistance genes , β-lactam resistance genes , chloramphenicol resistance genes , streptothricin resistance genes , an orfd encoding a protein with unknown function, a putative glucose dehydrogenase. moreover, the arrays aadb and aada <dig> in class  <dig> integrons were found during the entire process, indicating the most common array. previous studies have reported aada <dig>  aaca4-cmla <dig>  dfra17-aada <dig> and dfra12-orff-aada <dig> genes as frequently found gene cassettes both in clinical and environmental strains  <cit> .

common gene cassette arrangements in class  <dig> integrons were found in s.aureus strains . it should be noted, the cassette array dfra1-sat2-aada <dig> was detected most frequently in class  <dig> integrons . furthermore, integron-positive isolates were resistant to different classes of antimicrobial agents but related resistance gene cassettes were not found to be harbored on the integron, implying the nonintegron sources of resistance to these antibiotics  <cit> . in this study, integron cassette region could not be amplified by pcr in  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the class  <dig> and  <dig> integron-containing isolates respectively. in the cases where the cassette array could not be amplified, there is no cassettes or in the absent, significant alter-ation in the  <dig> cs primer binding site or a very large size of the integron cassette are the most likely explanations for the negative pcrs  <cit> .

the total prevalence of integrases carried in plasmids 36 %  was similar to that previously reported in s.aureus  <cit> . nevertheless, we are aware that the prevalence obtained may be biased due to the fact that plasmid and chromosomal dna can display the same electrophoretic mobility. the dissemination of the class  <dig> integrons, in many instances, has been attributed to the spread of an integron-containing transposon, tn <dig>  <cit> . the distribution of tn <dig> in clinical isolates correlates with the frequency of trimethoprim resistance  <cit> . trimethoprim resistance is due to the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme encoded by the dhfr gene in tn <dig>  <cit> . class  <dig> integron variable regions were amplified using primers that bind to atti <dig> and to orfx, situated downstream of the cassette region within transposon tn <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the presence of such an integron in s.aureus may have had its origin in a transposition event.

antimicrobial resistance patterns revealed that  <dig>  % of the integrase-positive strains were multiresistant .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of the presence of classes  <dig> and  <dig> integrons in isolates of s.aureus in iran. these results indicated with the spread of mdr strains, class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons carrying gene cassettes are widely disseminated among s.aureus strains in our hospital. in cases that significant relationship between the presence of integrons and antibiotic resistance were not observed, resistance could be achieved by different ways such as deficiency in cell wall enzymes or resistance under plasmid or chromosome control  <cit> .
