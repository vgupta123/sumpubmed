BACKGROUND
embryonic stem cells  are pluripotent cells with the capacity for self-renewal  <cit> , differentiation, and rapid proliferation. escs were firstly isolated from mouse inner cell mass   <cit> , and subsequently isolated from pig  <cit> , monkey  <cit> , rat  <cit> , and other species. it remains difficult to isolate and culture escs from goats and other hoofed animals, due to limited knowledge of esc growth features and culture conditions. although isolation and cultivation of goat escs have been achieved over the past several decades, goat esc lines have not been established, which largely limited the application of goat escs in genetic epidemiology, disease models, neomorphs, and animal species breeding.

the role of genetic engineering of goats has been established in the pharmacy industry, including the production of recombinant proteins, such as antibodies for research and human drugs, or even in advanced clinical trials  <cit> . in addition, goat is a popular animal model species for research of human diseases. research in many fields takes the advantage of its high genome homology with humans, which is helpful for optimizing therapeutic protocols and exploring the basic biology . the traditional method of establishing an ips cell line is to transfect inducible factors such as oct <dig>  sox <dig>  kif <dig>  and c-myc into somatic cells carried by viral vectors. the efficiency of this transfection approach and, the frequency with which all of the inducible factors express simultaneously are very low. meanwhile, as the viral vectors insert randomly into the somatic cell genome, which may affect the expression quantity of other genes, or cause genetic mutations leading to the expression of proto-oncogenes . although alternative methods using plasmid vectors  <cit> , multiple protein expression  <cit> , small molecules  <cit> , and transposition reduced the integration of exogenous genetic material and improved the security of ips acquisition  <cit> , these methods suffer from complexity and low preparation efficiency.

mrna-mediated reprogramming of somatic cells was firstly carried out by warrens et al.  <cit>  several years ago. they successfully reprogrammed animal somatic cells by using multiple extracorporeal transfections of mrnas of the reprogramming factors. in principle, this method is in advantage as it avoids the possible insertion of exogenous genes into the somatic cell chromosome. moreover, mrna reprogramming may improve guidance efficiency by two orders of magnitude, and double the speed of cell reprogramming. current efforts to produce ips using mrna induction mainly focus on human and mouse, and we are unaware of such work using goat cells.

to produce safe goat ips cell lines with stable inheritance, in the present study we reprogrammed goat somatic cells using the mrna of multifunction inducible factors. we verified the feasibility of inducing goat ips with the mrna of transcription factors oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  and c-myc, and analyzed the mechanism of endogenous and exogenous pluripotent genes change during the induction process. we further determined the karyotypes of goat ips, and explored the transcriptional mechanisms regulating the goat stem cells developmental process.

RESULTS
generation of mrna induced goat ipscs
to evaluate the transfection efficiency and localize the four transcription factors in gefs, we performed indirect immunofluorescence assay. the results showed the oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  and c-myc mrnas had been successfully transfected into the gefs with the efficiency more than 90%, and all the four reprogramming factors were localized in the nucleus . six days after mrna transfection, the gefs morphology started to change from spindle to round, and the cells were observed to proliferate rapidly . the cells exhibited aggregation growth on day  <dig>  small clone-like cells could be seen on day  <dig>  subsequently, we observed large, round esc-like cells with clear cell bounders on day  <dig> and typical flat and dense goat es-like clones on day  <dig> . goat ips cells were presented as round and tight colonies. they have high cytoplasmic ratio and obvious endoblasts, which were similar to the morphology of mouse and sheep escs . totally, we obtained about  <dig> akp positive clones from the initial  <dig> gefs, indicating the induction rate was approximately 1%. the results above imply that mrnas of the reprogramming factors can be transfected into gefs and exert function in the nucleus, and induce gefs into ipscs.fig.  <dig> transfection and localization of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig> and c-myc in gefs. indirect immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the transfection of mrna from the four reprogramming factors oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig> and c-myc. after five consecutive transfections, expression of the four reprogramming factors were observed in gefs, and localized in the nucleus. gefs without transfection were used as the blank control. immunofluorescence staining without primary antibodies was employed as the negative control. neither blank control or negative control showed positive staining. scale bar: 50 μm

characterization of derived goat ips cell line
with the approach mentioned above, we established a goat ips cell line  that stably passaged for over  <dig> generations . the doubling time of the ips cell line was about  <dig>  h. the cloning efficiency for the f <dig> and f <dig> generations were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively. the clones formed in goat ips <dig> cell line could be positively stained with akp . immunofluorescence staining revealed that the goat ips <dig> cell line express goat escs markers, including oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  c-myc, nanog, rex <dig>  ssea- <dig>  tra-1- <dig> and tra-1- <dig> . the expression of escs markers of goat ipscs was further confirmed by qrt-pcr, and the results showed that escs marker genes oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog, dax <dig> and gdf <dig> were highly expressed in goat ipscs . among all the markers detected, the expression of nanog and rex- <dig> implied the activation of endogenous reprogramming network. in addition, qrt-pcr also revealed that goat ips <dig> maintained a relatively stable expression of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog in passages . meanwhile, the expression of dna methyltranferase dnmt3b and dna dymethyltransferase tet <dig>   <dig>   <dig> was also detected with qrt-pcr. dnmt3b was expressed in goat ips <dig> cell line, but not in gefs, whereas, tet <dig> and tet <dig> were nearly not detected in goat ips <dig> cell line, confirming the initiation of reprogramming process in goat ips cell line . the results above indicate the esc-like properties of the goat ips <dig> cell line we derived.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of the derived goat ipscs. a the properties of goat ips <dig> cell line were evaluated with escs markers, including oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf  <dig>  nanog, cdx <dig>  rex, ssea- <dig>  tra-1- <dig> and tra-1- <dig>  all these markers were positively stained in the goat ips cell line. gefs without transfections were used as the blank control, which did not express escs markers. immunofluorescence staining of goat ips <dig> cells without primary antibodies was used as the negative control. scale bar: 50 μm. b qrt-pcr analysis confirmed that the goat ips <dig> cell line express a variety of escs marker genes, including oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog, dax <dig> and gdf <dig>  the expression of dna methyltranferase dnmt3b and dna dymethyltransferase tet <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were also detected with qrt-pcr. c quantitative evaluation of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog expression in different passages of goat ips <dig> cell line. up: oct <dig>  middle: sox <dig>  down: nanog




as the escs are capable to differentiate into any of the three germ layers, we, therefore, assessed this ability on goat ips cell line we derived. the goat ips <dig> cells were cultured in high glucose dmem medium with 10% fbs for  <dig> to 7 days to form the embryoid bodies . the embryoid bodies were then detected with the markers represent for three germ layers. qrt-pcr analysis showed that the goat ipscs had differentiated into cells with the characteristics of all the three germ layers, as they express afp , dcn , neurod , nfh , myf <dig>  and renin  . to further validate this findings with immunofluorescence staining, the obtained embryoid bodies were trypsinized and cultured in flasks coated with gelatin, and cultured for several days. immunofluorescence results showed that the cells were positively stained with all the three germ layers markers including sma, sox <dig> and tuj- <dig>  the results above demonstrated that the goat ipscs we induced share the property of pluripotency as that in the escs .fig.  <dig> goat ipscs is able to differentiate into three germ layer cells. a morphology of embryoid bodies derived from the goat ips <dig> cell line. scale bar: 50 μm. b qrt-pcr evaluation of the three germ layer marker genes expression was performed on the embryoid bodies derived from different generations of the goat ips <dig> cell line. afp and dcn , neurod and nfh , myf <dig> and renin . the emboyid bodies derived express these marker genes. c immunocytochemistry staining of the three germ layers markers, smooth muscle actin , sox <dig>  and βiii-tubulin , were conducted, showing positive staining of the emboyid bodies induced from the goat ipscs. ipscs without induction were used as the blank control, which did not express the three markers. immunofluorescence staining of the induced embyoid cells without primary antibodies was used as the negative control. scale bar: 50 μm




reprogramming mechanism in mrna induced goat ipscs
to understand the induction process of goat ipscs, we evaluated the expression of the pluripotent markers with qrt-pcr and western blots. it showed that the expression of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  and c-myc mrnas reached its maximum on day six after transfection and then decreased gradually . on day  <dig>  the four genes expression was almost disappeared. after that, their expression, along with endogenous pluripotent genes nanog and tert, began to increase . western blots analysis of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  c-myc and nanog further confirmed their expression pattern in protein level . the results indicate that exogenous oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  and c-myc gradually decreased to its minimum by day  <dig>  and the endogenous expression of the pluripotent factors was subsequently initiated . these results suggest that the endogenous reprogramming network could be activated by exogenous mrnas in the reprogramming process.fig.  <dig> reprogramming mechanism in the process of mrna induction. a the expression of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  and c-myc were evaluated by qrt-pcr. their expression reached the maximum 6 days after transfection and then decreased to the minimum on day  <dig>  then, the expression of these reprogramming factors increased gradually afterwards. b expression of the endogenous pluripotent genes nanog and tert began to increase on day  <dig>  c western blot analysis of the oct <dig>  sox <dig>  kllf <dig>  c-myc and nanog during mrna-induction process. d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> represent the day after exogenous mrna transfection into gefs. d schematic diagram of the endogenous and exogenous expression pattern of the reprogramming markers during mrna-induced gefs reprogramming process




epigenetic and genetic alternations in mrna induced goat ipscs
as epigenetic regulation has been identified to possibly regulate ipscs formation, we analyzed the dynamic change of the epigenetic status by performing bisulfite genomic sequencing of the promoter in the endogenous gene nanog. our results demonstrated that the cpg island methylation level in the nanog promoter region decreased gradually alone with the formation of goat ipscs, and the unmethylated status was observed to maintain in passages of the goat ips cell line . meanwhile, the goat ipscs at generation  <dig> and  <dig> showed normal karyotype with  <dig> autosomes and two sex chromosomes during passage . combine with previous qrt-pcr and western blot results , these results strongly indicate that the endogenous nanog gene promoter was reactivated during goat ipscs generation.fig.  <dig> epigenetic and genetic changes of goat ipscs. a bisulfite genomic sequencing of the key pluripotent gene nanog promoter area showed reduced methylation level during goat ipscs generation, and the low methylation status was maintained in goat ips <dig> passages from  <dig> to  <dig>  the open and closed circles represent the unmethylated and methylated cpgs, respectively. gefs without transfection was used as the negative control b karyotype analysis of the goat ips <dig> cell line at passages  <dig> and  <dig> showed normal  <dig> xy karyotypes




initiation mechanism of the reprogramming gene promoters in goat ipscs induction
to understand the mechanisms of reprogramming factor promoters in goat ipscs induction, we analyzed the promoter regions of the four key genes. different deletions of the sox <dig>  c-myc, oct <dig> and klf <dig> promoters were cloned and inserted into pgl- <dig> vector, for which the activity of each deletion was evaluated by dual luciferase assay. the results showed the core promoter of sox <dig> gene was located in the region of −1298 ~ + 49 bp  . meanwhile, the transcription binding sites of the sox <dig> core promoter were predicted, and the corresponding binding site-directed mutation vectors were constructed. dual luciferase assays demonstrated that, the key transcription factor binding sites located in sox <dig> core promoter region were elf- <dig> and ap- <dig> . furthermore, to explore the epigenetic regulation of the reprogramming factors, 10 μm 5-azadc and 1 μm of tsa were used to demethylate and deacetylate the sox <dig> core promoter. the results indicate that demethylation and deacetylation of the sox <dig> core promoter could significantly enhance the activity . the methylation status of the sox <dig> promoter was further confirmed by bisulfite genomic sequencing, and it clearly showed that the promoter methylation was declined significantly after 20 days induction . besides sox <dig>  we also explored the core regions and epigenetic status of c-myc, oct <dig> and klf <dig> promoters, and all of these factors exhibited similar modifications during goat ipscs induction .fig.  <dig> analysis of goat sox <dig> promoter. a goat sox <dig> promoter activity was assessed by dual luciferase reporter assay of different promoter deletions, and the pgl3-p <dig> deletion showed the highest activity among all the deletions we colned. loss the function of ap- <dig> and elf- <dig> transcription factor binding sites significantly reduced the promoter activity. treatment with tsa and 5-azadc significantly improved the activity of pgl3-p <dig>   b bisulfite genomic sequencing of the sox <dig> promoter showed  <dig> modified cpg sites, among which, the methylated sites were significantly reduced in derived goat ipscs




discussion
the present study demonstrated that transfection of multiple transcription factor mrnas is able to reprogram goat somatic cells into ips cells. compared with previous reported approaches for ipscs generation, mrna–based methods are gaining progressively more attention due to the safety and high efficiency. mrna induced ipscs get avoid of the tumorigenic risks raised in retrovirus  <cit> , lentivirus  <cit>  and adenovirus  <cit>  directed transfection and induction  <cit> .

in vitro preparation of mrna from the four transcription factors is the key step in this approach. to initiate transcription in vitro, t <dig> or sp <dig> transcriptional promoters are required. pcdna <dig>  vector contains t <dig> promoter recognition regions and various internal restriction enzyme recognition sites, which is an optional tool to be used for t <dig> promoter induced in vitro transcription.

in our study, mrna induced goat ipscs from gefs were similar as that of the human ipscs obtained by matthew  <cit>  , and the morphological changes of the gefs during the induction process were almost the same as that in non-mrna induced human and mouse ipscs  <cit>  and mrna induced human ipscs  <cit> . our results illustrate that we successfully generated goat ipscs with mrna induction. the derived goat ips cells share most of the characteristics as goat es cell clones with respect to morphology, growth properties and expression of pluripotent markers. the results from western blot and qrt-pcr demonstrated the activation of endogenous oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  and c-myc on day  <dig> after mrna transfection, indicating the initiation of endogenous reprogramming mechanism at this time. meanwhile, analysis of endogenous nanog expression and the methylation status of its promoter further confirmed the activation of endogenous regulatory network on day  <dig> after mrna transfection.

the first study regarding mrna-induced reprogramming of ipscs was reported by warren et al.  <cit> . they used transcription vector carrying human oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig> and c-myc genes to obtain mrna in vitro, and transfected the mrnas into human fibroblasts to obtain human ipscs. the feasibility of this approach was further validated by heng et al.  <cit>  using mrna to reprogram human cells. in the process of mrna induced animal ipscs generation, the exogenous mrna of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  and c-myc transcription factor need to continuously function in the nucleus of transfected somatic cells for no less than 8 days, and maintain in a high expression level. our data indicate that, after five-time continuous transfection, the mrna in goat gefs could be stably expressed for almost 9 days in the nucleus with a high level. meanwhile, suppressing immunologic responses in target cells is another point we need to pay attention to. matthew et al.  <cit>  used sirna to inhibit the expression of key proteins responsible for immunologic responses that induced by prolonged mrna transfection, and they achieved somatic cells reprogramming by multiple transfection of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig> and utf <dig> mrnas.

CONCLUSIONS
we successfully generated goat ipscs by transfection of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig> and c-myc mrnas into gefs, which initiated the endogenous reprogramming network and altered the methylation status of pluripotent genes. core promoter regions and functional transcription binding sites of the four reprogramming genes were identified. epigenetic regulation was revealed to participate in mrna induced ipscs formation. our study provides a safe and efficient approach for goat. ipscs generation.
