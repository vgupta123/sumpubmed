BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short , non-coding rnas present in diverse organisms that regulate gene expression via the rna silencing machinery. mirnas can induce translational repression of a target transcript and/or mrna degradation depending to some extent on the degree of complementarity between the mirna and binding sites in the 3' untranslated regions  of its target  <cit> . a number of mirnas have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and more recently in viral and metabolic diseases  <cit> .

previous studies have suggested that genes encoding mirnas are surprisingly long, given the size of the processed mature final product. the mirna biogenesis process is well-elucidated, and involves two intermediate transcript species  <cit> : the primary transcript , which can be several thousand bases long, is cleaved by the ribonuclease enzyme drosha in the nucleus to a shorter,  <dig> nt stem-loop structure known as the precursor  mirna. a subset of intronic mirnas, known as mirtrons, bypass drosha processing and are spliced from the intron  <cit> . the pre-mirna is exported to the cytoplasm by the export factor exportin  <dig>  <cit> , where it is cleaved by the dicer enzyme to form the mature mirna  <cit> . finally, the mature mirna is incorporated into a ribonuclear particle , which becomes the rna-induced gene silencing complex , capable of executing rna-based gene silencing  <cit> . a large number of studies have been directed at understanding the processing of mature mirnas and their target recognition. however, few studies exist pertaining to the structure of the primary mirna transcripts  <cit> . indeed, while the genomic coordinates and structures of precursor mirna and mature mirnas are easily obtained, there are only a handful of mammalian pri-mirnas whose complete structures are determined experimentally  <cit> . thus, there is a need to predict the transcript structure of pri-mirnas and to demarcate their 5' and 3' boundaries. such studies will help us to locate transcriptional regulatory motifs, facilitate our understanding of the regulation of mirna expression and provide information required to make target constructs for mirna knockouts.

previous studies attempted to predict the transcript boundaries of pri-mirnas based on features such as expressed sequence tags  and transcription factor binding sites  . recently, we described a large-scale analysis of distribution of transcription features in the flanking regions of human pre-mirnas  <cit> . this study showed that many transcription start sites  and cpg islands lie within  <dig> kb of the precursor, but a small number appear to be 10s of kb upstream. using other features in combination proved to be useful for predicting pri-mirna boundaries. however, our previous study focused only on human sequences and was able to predict the putative boundaries for a limited set of pri-mirnas. it is known that mirnas are well conserved across a wide range of species, so it is of interest to determine whether pri-mirnas have conserved transcript structures. furthermore, identifying the consensus features of conserved mirnas facilitates the prediction of transcript boundaries of a larger set of mirnas.

we have analyzed a combination of predicted transcriptional features  signals) and direct evidence  and gene identification signature  ditags) in order to predict the 5' and 3' boundaries of pri-mirnas. we have used three closely related genomes, human, mouse and rat, to obtain sets of conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas using bidirectional blast and conserved synteny analysis. each set is then surveyed for transcription features in their flanking regions, and transcriptional boundaries annotated. we describe here the characteristics of the predicted pri-mirna transcripts.

RESULTS
obtaining conserved pre-mirnas
pre-mirnas from the three genomes  are divided into four groups  group i: pre-mirnas conserved in all three genomes,  group ii: pre-mirnas conserved in two of the three genomes,  group iii: pre-mirnas that are unique to one of the three genomes, but have multiple paralogous copies, and  group iv: singleton pre-mirnas unique to one of three genomes.

group i pre-mirnas
a total of  <dig> annotated pre-mirnas  are found to be conserved in human, mouse and rat. we looked at their genomic location to determine the fraction of mirnas overlapping protein-coding genes and between annotated genes. we also examine whether the genomic location is similar among species. we found  <dig> pre-mirnas located in intergenic sequences,  <dig> overlapping ensembl genes, and, surprisingly, the remaining  <dig> exhibited different genomic contexts between species . a careful analysis of such inconsistencies in genomic locations in spite of conserved synteny shows that differences arise because of different host gene annotation  in the  <dig> organisms . for example, human mir- <dig> overlaps the exon of the refseq gene , which has no annotated ortholog in mouse and rat. differences in the structure of orthologous genes  may also cause an intronic mirna in one organism to be annotated as intergenic in another. while these observations may reflect real gene content and structure differences, many are likely due to mis-annotation of potential mirna host genes. for example, it is reported that the majority of vertebrate gene annotations may have missing 5' exons  <cit> .

group ii pre-mirnas
we obtained  <dig> pairs of human-mouse pre-mirnas, which are not conserved in rat. similarly, we obtained  <dig> pairs of human-rat conserved pre-mirnas and  <dig> pairs of mouse-rat conserved pre-mirnas .

group iii pre-mirnas
we found  <dig> human mirnas with no identified orthologs in mouse and rat. similarly, we obtained  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas in mouse and rat respectively that lack an annotated ortholog in the other  <dig> species.  <dig> out of  <dig> human mirnas group into  <dig> paralogous families, according to an all-against-all blastn search  . the largest set of paralogs comprises  <dig> members clustered on chromosome  <dig> . we observe that  <dig> paralogous families with one or more mirnas have previously defined orthologs in mouse and/or rat, and are therefore included in groups i and ii above. for instance, the human genome has  <dig> paralogous mir- <dig> genes. hsa-mir-199a- <dig> has defined orthologs in both mouse and rat, and hsa-mir-199b is orthologous to mmu-mir-199b. such paralogous families are shown .  <dig> mouse and  <dig> rat mirnas grouped into  <dig> and  <dig> paralogous families respectively . the largest paralogous family in mouse represents  <dig> mirnas, all located on chromosome  <dig> .

†† orthologs in mouse and rat. †m orthologs in mouse only.

group iv pre-mirnas
there are  <dig> singleton human mirnas with no defined homologs. we also find  <dig> mouse and  <dig> rat singleton mirnas . these may represent species-specific mirnas. it is also likely that with ongoing mirna discovery and the addition of new sequences to mirbase, some singleton mirnas may find relationships to new mirnas.

annotation of pri-mirnas
we analyzed different transcriptional features in the flanking regions of mirnas, in order to predict the putative boundaries of their primary transcripts. it is widely assumed that intronic mirnas are generally transcribed coincidentally with their host genes. the pri-mirna in these cases is therefore the host protein-coding transcript. we therefore focus on predicting primary transcripts of intergenic mirnas . the 5' ends of pri-mirnas are annotated based on the mappings of predicted tss, cpg islands and 5' cage tags to the upstream flanking regions. similarly, the 3' end is demarcated based on predicted polya signals and 3' ditags in the downstream flanking region. further, these predictions are supported by transcriptional evidence, either from cdna or ests. highly confident annotations are obtained for  <dig> pri-mirnas, with  <dig> pri-mirnas conserved in all  <dig> species ,  <dig> pri-mirnas conserved in only two species ,  <dig> human unique pri-mirnas and  <dig> mouse unique pri-mirnas. the predicted transcript structures are also analyzed for functional regulatory regions such as promoter-associated regulatory sequences and ctcf-enriched insulator sites surrounding the putative 5' ends.

group i pri-mirnas
we annotate  <dig> predicted pri-mirnas conserved in human, mouse and rat, expressing mature products from  <dig> pre-mirnas. among them,  <dig> pri-mirnas are polycistronic and the remaining  <dig> each contain a single mirna hairpin.  <dig> of the predicted polycistronic transcripts are found to be completely overlapped by ests/cdnas . for instance, the cluster mir-29b-2~29c on chromosome  <dig> in mouse is completely overlapped by a cdna  spanning approximately  <dig> bp upstream from the 5' end of the cluster to  <dig>  bp downstream from the 3' end of the cluster. predicted lengths of pri-mirnas and features supporting their annotation are shown . the predicted genomic coordinates of pri-mirnas are provided in additional file  <dig>  here, we describe in detail the annotation of three pri-mirnas.

let-7i
the mirna let-7i is conserved in all  <dig> species, located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in human, mouse and rat respectively. the flanking upstream and downstream orthologous genes are monensin sensitive gene  and protein phosphatase 1h . six transcription feature types  support the structure of pri-let-7i. in human there are  <dig> closely situated tss predictions, on average  <dig> bp upstream of 5' end of the precursor . we identify cpg islands overlapping the predicted tss, strongly supporting the 5' end annotation.  <dig> ests overlap with 5' ends close to the predicted tss and cpg islands. among them, est 'da092355' completely overlaps hsa-let-7i. in mouse and rat, there are more than  <dig> tightly clustered tss predictions, at  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp upstream of the precursor in mouse and rat respectively . the 5' end is also supported by predicted cpg islands and fantom 5'cage tags in mouse at ~ <dig> bp upstream of the start of the precursor. in rat, a cpg island at ~ <dig> bp upstream of rno-let-7i overlaps with the predicted tss. these upstream features strongly suggest that the 5' end of pri-let-7i in mouse and rat is within ~ <dig> bp of the pre-mirna. moreover, the closely clustered tss predictions suggest a "broad" promoter, with each tss representing an independent form of the pri-mirna  <cit> . in human, three 5' ditags  overlap with the predicted tss/cpg as shown . the associated 3' tags are located at ~ <dig> bp downstream of let-7i. we identify a polya signal 'aataaa' at ~ <dig> bp from the 3' end of hsa-let-7i, which overlaps with the 3' ends of  <dig> ests . hence, it can be concluded that the 3' end of pri-let-7i in human is situated within ~ <dig> bp of the 3' end of the precursor. in mouse,  <dig> polya signals, 'aataaa' and 'tataaa ' predict the 3' end of the pri-mirna to be ~ <dig> bp downstream of the precursor, supported by  <dig> ests and a cdna  within  <dig> bp of the predicted polya signals. in rat,  <dig> ests and a cdna support a strongly conserved 3' end. based on these analyses, we conclude that the distribution of transcription features around let-7i is similar in human, mouse and rat and their pri-mirnas are strongly conserved in lengths and boundaries .

further, we analyzed the regulatory features such as promoters and insulator sequences in the upstream region of the predicted human pri-let-7i. insulators are sequences located between enhancers and promoters of adjacent genes and prevent an enhancer from inappropriately binding to and activating the promoter of a neighbouring gene. in vertebrates, insulator function requires association with ccctc factor  binding sites. the normalized chromatin immunoprecipitation genome-tiling  array scores for ctcf binding sites and the sequence conservation of the regulatory features in the upstream regions of mouse and rat pri-let-7i are shown . we identify promoter sequences and ctcf binding sites spanning a region from  <dig> . <dig> kb to  <dig> . <dig> kb, ~ <dig> kb upstream of the predicted 5' end of pri-let-7i. the corresponding regions in mouse and rat show a strong conservation in relative position, suggesting the putative promoter regions. analyzing these regions using the ucsc conserved transcription factors track allowed us to identify two conserved transcription factors binding sites: activating transcription factor  <dig>  and upstream transcription factor  <dig>  located at ~ <dig> . <dig> kb, which may be important for let-7i expression. however, delineating the transcription factors that bind in the promoter region requires further analysis and experimental validations.

we predicted the consensus secondary structure of pri-let-7i based on the sequence alignments of human, mouse and rat sequences, using rnaalifold   <cit> . the conserved pair residues are marked in red. it can be seen that the stem segments immediately flanking the pre-mirna are conserved . previous studies have also shown that the sequences flanking the mirna hairpin are important for mirna biogenesis  <cit> . in particular, the stem extension located immediately adjacent to the pre-mirna hairpin and the single-stranded basal segments at the ends are required for efficient processing by drosha  <cit> .

mir-23a~27a~24-2
the order, orientation and relative spacing of the cluster mir-23a~27a~24- <dig> and its neighbouring genes, nanos homolog  <dig>  and zinc finger swim-type containing  <dig> , are conserved in all three species. the mapping of transcription features relative to the start and end of the precursor is shown . eponine predicts  <dig> tsss at an average distance of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp upstream of the start of the mir-23a in mouse and rat respectively, but none in human. the predicted tss in mouse is supported by  <dig> fantom 5'cage tags at  <dig>  bp from the start of mmu-mir-23a. cpg islands are predicted in close proximity to the tss and 5'cage mapping. taken together, these data suggest that the 5' end of the pri-mirna mir-23a~27a~24- <dig> is ~ <dig> bp upstream of mir-23a. although there is no evident feature supporting the 5' end of the human pri-mirna, we identify two ditags, u_ <dig> and u_ <dig>  with their 5' tags located at  <dig> bp upstream of hsa-mir-23a. no est/cdna data supports the 5' end of the pri-mirna in any of the species. for all three species, we identify a polya signal 'aataaa' at  <dig>  bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp downstream of mir-24- <dig> in human, mouse and rat respectively. the 3' end of the human pri-mirna cluster at  <dig> bp is also in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , although we note that the 5' boundary differs from that determined experimentally. in mouse, overlapping ests  support a 3' end located ~ <dig> bp downstream of mir-24- <dig>  in close proximity to the predicted polya signals . based on these, we predict the genomic coordinates of the polycistronic primary transcript of mir-23a~27a~24- <dig> in human, mouse and rat , to be  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in length respectively. for the human mirna cluster, we also obtained promoter-associated regions around  <dig> kb upstream of the pri-mirna. the predicted transcription factors  binding sites are shown  and the corresponding regions in mouse and rat are found to be conserved.

mir-124-1
the brain-specific mirna, mir-124- <dig> is an intergenic mirna conserved in all the  <dig> species, flanked by genes methionine sulfoxide reductase a  and kinesin family member 13b , although the human syntenic region lacks the kif13b gene annotation . mir-124- <dig> has the highest number of tss predictions of all mirnas in this study, the majority falling within  <dig>  bp upstream of mir-124- <dig> in all  <dig> species. the tss predictions are also supported by cpg islands  and 5' cage tags. moreover, in human, mir-124- <dig> is embedded in the cpg island, suggesting the intriguing possibility that its expression may be regulated by an epigenetic mechanism involving methylation of the cpg island. the human mir-124- <dig> has  <dig> tightly clustered 5'cage tags within  <dig> bp of the predicted tss, strongly supporting the 5' end of pri-mirna of hsa-mir-124- <dig> . in mouse, the predicted tss/cpg is further supported by  <dig> overlapped ests  and  <dig> cdna , which are located  <dig> bp upstream of mmu-mir-124- <dig> . the polya signal 'aataaa' in the downstream region is located at  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp from the 3' end of pre-mirna in human and mouse respectively. the polya signal prediction is corroborated in human, mouse and rat by multiple ests with 3' ends aligned between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp downstream from the 3' end of mir-124- <dig>  the predicted genomic coordinates of pri-mir-124- <dig> are given in additional file  <dig>  we also identify promoter-associated regulatory features and dnase <dig> hypersensitive sites in the region  <dig> – <dig>  kb upstream of human mir-124a- <dig>  overlapping with predicted tss/cpg, and the corresponding region is found to be conserved in mouse and rat . the promoter region is found to contain predicted binding sites for the transcription factors hua enhancer , x-box binding protein , homeobox protein  and nf-e2-related factor  <dig> .

group ii pri-mirnas
we annotate the boundaries of four pri-mirnas conserved in  <dig> of the  <dig> genomes. among them are two polycistronic transcripts , and two expressing single mirnas . figure  <dig> shows the predicted length of the pri-mirnas and the features supporting them. the predicted genomic coordinates of pri-mirnas are provided in additional file  <dig>  here, we describe in detail the annotation of the pri-mirna containing mir-15a and mir-16- <dig> 

mir-15a~16-1
the structure of a polycistronic transcript expressing mir-15a and mir-16- <dig> is strongly supported by all seven types of transcriptional features. the cluster is located between the genes dleu  and potassium channel regulator  on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> in human and mouse respectively. the features mapped to the flanking regions surrounding the hsa-mir-15a~16- <dig> are shown . in human, we predict  <dig> tsss with an average distance of  <dig>  bp upstream of mir-15a. the predicted tsss are also overlapped by cpg islands located at  <dig>  bp. a similar distribution of tss and cpg islands is observed in mouse at a larger distance . five 5' cage tags and three 5' ditags  are located within  <dig> bp of the predicted tss in both species and the 5' ends of multiple ests/cdnas overlap the predicted tss/cpg/5'cage . in mouse,  <dig> ests and  <dig> cdnas overlap the entire mirna cluster. taking all these features together, we annotate the 5' end of the human pri-mirna mir-15a~16- <dig> at ~ <dig> kb upstream of mir-15a.

polya signals 'aataaa', 'attaaa' and 'tataaa' are predicted at an average distance of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp from the 3' end of mir-16- <dig> in human and mouse respectively. the 3' end is also supported by ditags in human ,  <dig>  bp from the 3' end of mir-16- <dig>  and by ests and cdnas in both human and mouse . we conclude that the 3' boundaries of human and mouse pri-mirnas are similar, but that the length of the 5' upstream transcript is significantly different. the respective genomic coordinates and predicted lengths of pri-mirnas are shown . we identify promoter and ctcf binding sites  ~ <dig> bp upstream of the predicted tss in human, with the corresponding region conserved in mouse .

these data agree with previous annotation by the vega project of non-protein-coding transcripts  expressing mir-15a and mir-16- <dig> in human, called dleu <dig>  <cit> . this region has been shown to be deleted or down-regulated in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cases  <cit> .

species-specific  pri-mirnas
we are able to confidently predict the pri-mirnas of four species-specific mirnas with paralogs , three in human and one in mouse. the cluster hsa-mir-374a~ <dig> is a polycistronic transcript, as indicated by the complete overlap of  <dig> ests and  <dig> cdna . additionally, we confidently annotate the pri-mirnas of fifteen singleton mirnas, comprising  <dig> human mirnas and  <dig> mouse mirnas. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show examples of the pri-mirna structure of species-specific mirnas. genomic coordinates are provided in additional file  <dig> 

characteristics of predicted pri-mirnas
by analyzing the transcriptional features mapped in the upstream and downstream flanking regions surrounding the precursor mirnas, we are able to characterize the 5' and 3' ends and lengths of their primary transcripts. several observations can be made from these analyses.

mapping of 5'cage tags and prediction of polya signals in the flanking sequences of precursor mirnas in human, mouse and rat clearly indicate that the pri-mirnas are both 5' capped and polyadenylated. this provides strong evidence that the major fraction of mammalian mirnas is transcribed by rna polymerase ii . the distribution of pol ii tss predictions also supports this assumption. previous studies have also reported that the pol ii is the major polymerase of human mirna transcription  <cit> . however, a small number of mirnas lying within alu repeats have been reported to be transcribed by pol iii  <cit> .

we find that  <dig> of  <dig>  confidently annotated pri-mirnas contain more than one precursor mirna, clearly showing that clustered mirnas are often transcribed polycistronically.  <dig> of the polycistrons are conserved between human, mouse and rat. polycistronic mirnas are highly likely to be expressed at the same time and location, and therefore to be functionally related. the  <dig> precursor mirnas in  <dig> transcripts are organised as  <dig> pairs and  <dig> triplets. we also found  <dig> additional polycistronic mirna clusters supported by est/cdna data, though we were not able to confidently predict the 5' and 3' ends of their primary transcripts. interestingly, the length distributions of polycistronic pri-mirnas and those expressing a single mirna are very similar –  <dig> of  <dig>  of the predicted polycistronic pri-mirnas and  <dig> of  <dig>  of the single mirnas have lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> kb. figure  <dig> shows the length distributions of the predicted primary transcripts of human, mouse and rat mirnas with mean lengths of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp respectively. the graph also clearly shows that mirna genes are more clustered than expected by chance. indeed, the inflection point in the distribution of inter-mirna distances allows us to predict that around 50% of human mirnas are polycistronically transcribed in primary transcripts up to 10s of kb long. this is consistent with previous observations  <cit> . the mean length of a protein-coding pre-mrna in human is around  <dig> kb, while, surprisingly, the mean length of a pre-mrna that contains intronic mirnas is over  <dig> kb. non-protein-coding pri-mirna transcripts are therefore significantly shorter than protein-coding transcripts in general, and particularly those that also express mirnas. we note that we are able to annotate very few intergenic pri-mirnas with lengths greater than  <dig> kb. we cannot rule out the possibility that this reflects an annotation bias, due to difficulties in viewing and collating transcriptional feature evidence over larger distances.

we have examined the exon-intron organization of predicted pri-mirnas based on est/cdna alignments. ests or cdnas spanning the entire pre-mirna reveal that pri-mirnas have conventional exon-intron structures, although they appear to contain fewer introns than protein-coding messages. 44%  of our annotated pri-mirnas have good est/cdna alignments across the entire transcript. 92% of these have fewer than four introns .  <dig> pri-mirnas are intronless. for example, the cluster mmu-mir-144~ <dig> is overlapped by a full length cdna 'ak <dig> ', whose 5'/3' ends coincides with ditags. the set of unspliced transcripts also include pri-mir- <dig>  which was previously shown experimentally to be intronless  <cit> . about 50% of the predicted pri-mirnas have only one intron. for example pri-mir-196a- <dig> has one full-length cdna with its 5'/3' ends coinciding exactly with predicted tss, polya and ditags.

finally, we analyzed the sequence conservation along the whole length of predicted pri-mirnas, and  <dig> kb upstream of their putative 5' ends – examples are shown in figure  <dig>  conserved sequences within the pri-mirna may indicate regions important for mirna biogenesis, while upstream conservation may inform on regulatory signals. as expected, the conservation is highest in the precursor sequence  and in the segments immediately flanking the precursor. we also observe that the precursor sequences of group iv mirnas are poorly conserved in whole genome alignments. for example, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig> and hsa-mir- <dig> have low conservation values as compared to the flanking sequences , suggesting that these mirnas really are absent from rodent genomes. the precursor of mmu-mir- <dig> is very well conserved, suggesting that it is likely present in the other genomes, but not yet annotated. we also note that outside of the precursor, the most conserved regions tend to be at the ends of the predicted pri-mirnas. a few pri-mirnas exhibit conservation along the entire length of the pri-mirna  . some of these conserved flanking sequences may correspond to regulatory sequences, alternative transcripts or antisense transcripts. for instance, the high conservation of flanking sequence downstream of mir-497~ <dig> can be attributed to the presence of an antisense transcript 'c17orf49'. the  <dig> kb region upstream of the pri-mirna  is highly conserved in most of the pri-mirnas, except the hsa-mir-200b~200a~ <dig> cluster. the strong conserved blue peaks  upstream of pri-mirnas may represent the putative promoter regions.

CONCLUSIONS
previously, very little data has been presented regarding the primary transcript structures of mirnas. we have systematically annotated the primary transcripts of human, mouse and rat intergenic mirnas using various transcription-related features. the 5' end of the primary transcript is predicted based on mapped tss, cpg and 5' cage tags in the upstream region. the 3' end is predicted based on the mapping of polya signals, and supported by multiple ests/cdna mappings. in addition, the complete transcript structure is also supported by mapped ends of ditags. using conservation and synteny, we are able to identify the boundaries of a significant proportion of mammalian mirnas. we show that the transcription features in the flanking regions around conserved mirnas have similar distribution and exhibit similar transcript structure in the three genomes. the results also indicate that a significant fraction of pri-mirnas have lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> kb. previous experimental studies of pri-mirnas have also identified transcript lengths of 1– <dig> kb  <cit> . however, we also identify a small number of pri-mirna candidates with exceptional length – up to 100s of kb. while pri-mirnas are significantly shorter on average than protein-coding messages , the disparity between the length of the transcribed sequence and the final functional product is startling. it remains to be seen whether long non-protein-coding pri-mirnas have function in addition to that of the mirna itself.
