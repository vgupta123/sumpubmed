BACKGROUND
the first cyclotide was isolated from the plant oldenlandia affinis, a member of the rubiaceae  family, which is widely distributed throughout the congo region of africa. pregnant women of the lulua tribe would drink a tea made from an infusion of o. affinis leaves in order to accelerate their labours. in the early 1970s, these uterotonic properties were attributed to a peptide named kalata b <dig>  <cit> . it was not until  <dig> years later that the structure of kalata b <dig> was described as having a backbone that is head-to-tail cyclised and possessing a disulfide knotted three-dimensional structure  <cit> . kalata b <dig> was later shown to be produced from a larger precursor protein  <cit> . the name "cyclotide" was coined  <cit>  to describe peptides with similar properties in the rubiaceae, violaceae and cucurbitaceae families. with over  <dig> cyclotides already sequenced, a dozen structures determined and thousands more predicted from mass spectrometry profiles, cyclotides could be the largest known family of plant peptides  <cit> .

cyclotides are exceptionally resistant to thermal and biochemical extremes and to treatment with endoproteases  <cit> . it is thought that cyclotides function as defence molecules within plants, as some have been shown to have insecticidal properties  <cit> . this stability has motivated the development of cyclotides as scaffolds for the stabilisation and presentation of bioactive peptides in drug design  <cit> . they also have a range of potential applications in agriculture, given their insecticidal properties  <cit>  and nematocidal activities  <cit> .

o. affinis is a perennial herb with a woody root that grows at altitudes up to  <dig>  metres above sea level  <cit> . eighteen o. affinis cyclotides have been sequenced to date  <cit> , but their processing mechanisms have only begun to be elucidated  <cit> . cyclotides are notably absent in model plants arabidopsis thaliana and nicotiana tabacum . transgenic expression of precursor proteins for cyclotide kalata b <dig> in arabidopsis and tobacco produces a small proportion of the correctly processed cyclic form in addition to a number of mis-processed  linear forms not usually found in o. affinis  <cit> . this observation suggests that plants which do not produce cyclotides still contain machinery capable of processing them. however, efficient processing might require specially adapted pathways. alternatively, these species might contain additional pathways that degrade cyclotides or inhibit proper cyclotide processing.

sequencing of expressed sequence tags  obtained from plant tissues and organs has been used to provide insights into the machinery underpinning biological processes. lange et al.  <cit>  found enzymes responsible for essential oil metabolism using ests from a cdna library made from mentha × piperita  leaves rich in essential oils. davis et al.  <cit>  later used ests to elucidate the nature of production of menthone, the predominant monoterpene produced in the essential oil of maturing peppermint. using an est approach, newcomb et al.  <cit>  discovered genes responsible for fruit ripening, flavour, colour and biosynthesis of health-related compounds in apple.

in this study, we estimated the genome size of o. affinis using flow cytometry and report an est sequencing project for o. affinis that resulted in the isolation of  <dig>  high-quality ests. this is the first significant sequencing effort of o. affinis and a step towards building a valuable resource that will help understand the molecular basis of cyclotide biosynthesis. we found o. affinis commits  <dig> % of its transcriptome to cyclotide precursors and  <dig> % to proteins predicted to be involved in cyclotide processing. discovery of the proteins responsible for efficient processing of cyclic peptides will enable the efficient use of model plants or plant cells for generating cyclotides or engineered molecules with pharmaceutically active peptides grafted within the cyclic peptide backbone. these two possibilities could lead to novel crop protection strategies and the use of plants as tools for cost-effective production of peptide drugs.

RESULTS
oldenlandia affinis genome size
the somatic chromosome number of o. affinis is 2n =  <dig> , which is in agreement with other oldenlandia species, such as o. corymbosa, where chromosome numbers are nine or a multiple thereof  <cit> . the genome size of o. affinis was determined by using flow cytometry with glycine max 'polanka'  as an internal reference standard. figure  <dig> shows the dna histogram obtained from the o. affinis seedlings and the internal reference standard. genome sizes  for o. affinis seedlings and adult plants were estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg, respectively. considering  <dig> pg =  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp =  <dig> mbp  <cit> , the monoploid genome size is between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp. certain variations between different ontogenetic stages  can be due to different levels of secondary metabolites and instrument fluctuation. 1c-values in rubiaceae plants vary from  <dig>  to  <dig>  pg, with median and mean values of  <dig>  pg and  <dig>  pg, respectively http://data.kew.org/cvalues. o. affinis therefore possesses one of the largest holoploid genomes of the rubiaceae family.

est sequencing and analysis
using a cdna library made from o. affinis leaves  <cit> , we generated  <dig>  ests. after editing raw sequences for quality and discarding sequences less than  <dig> bp in length,  <dig>  sequences remained with an average read length of  <dig> bp. 60% of the ests were above  <dig> bp and 48% were above  <dig> bp . all edited est sequences were submitted to genbank dbest . the  <dig>  ests were clustered into  <dig> contigs, comprising  <dig> consensus sequences and  <dig> singletons using seqman sequence assembly software . clone redundancy was 45%. of the total ests, 27% represent singletons, which is similar to the values of 27% in cotton  <cit> ,  <dig> % in bean  <cit> , and 29% in pineapple  <cit> . to investigate the level of redundancy, contigs were listed by clone abundance, from contigs containing the largest number of ests to those containing a single est. almost half of the ests  were found to cluster within just 16% of contigs, thus transcription of a small subset of genes appears to dominate a high proportion of the transcriptome. however, as library construction involved an amplification step, the possibility that amplification bias might have contributed to the high level of redundancy cannot be discounted.

*raw sequences were automatically trimmed using seqman . after editing only clones above  <dig> bp in length were retrieved.

bioinformatics
to assign putative functions to o. affinis ests, sequences were exported in fasta format and conducted with the basic local alignment search tool  and performed against the genbank non-redundant database  <cit> . a stringent blastx cut-off of 10e- <dig> was chosen to ensure annotations were based on cdnas with a high degree of similarity. using these parameters, 21% of ests did not show significant homology to coding sequences in the genbank non-redundant database and therefore could not be confidently annotated. blastx of the predicted proteins from the longest open reading frame of these unannotated ests resulted in the majority of ests  falling below the 10e- <dig> cut-off value chosen, with the remaining 25% not showing significant homology to any genbank proteins. those undiscovered sequences from o. affinis include novel coding sequences, as well as sequences that are non-protein coding. due the stringent cut-off limit of 10e- <dig>  ests with a short length of overlapping open reading frame  sequence or small orfs were not annotated.

79% of ests were annotated by similarity to coding sequences in the genbank non-redundant database. of these, approximately 44% of ests shared 80% or higher identity with existing sequences, 24% had identity of between  <dig> - 80%, and less than 10% shared less than 60% identity to known coding sequences. of these ests, 29% were predicted to be full length cdna clones, starting with an atg codon at a similar position to its closest blastx hit.

functional annotation
ests returning a valid blastx hit from genbank were individually searched against the arabidopsis information resource   <cit>  and the munich information center for protein sequences  matdb database  <cit> . annotation of o. affinis ests was based on sequence homology to arabidopsis genes; ests were then functionally annotated according to the mips funcat schema  <cit> .

of the  <dig> ests returning a valid blastx hit,  <dig> % could not be functionally annotated by comparison with genes in arabidopsis. cyclotide precursor genes fell within this group since arabidopsis does not produce cyclotides.  <dig> % of ests were found to encode proteins of unknown function. the remaining ests were grouped into six main categories : metabolism , information pathway , transport , perception and response to stimuli , developmental processes  and localisation . these were further subdivided into  <dig> subcategories   <cit> .

*the cyclotide precursors are within this subcategory.

contigs composed of most abundant ests
analysis of est frequency  can provide insights into gene expression levels and biochemical functions occurring in a tissue. we identified the  <dig> most abundantly expressed contigs . two contigs of these  <dig> most abundant ests were cyclotide precursor protein genes for kalata b <dig>  and kalata b <dig> , which is consistent with kalata b <dig> and b <dig> being the most abundant in cyclotide profiles  <cit> .

*the cyclotides precursors are highlighted.

identification of ests involved in cyclotide biosynthesis
although the number of known cyclotide peptide sequences has grown to > <dig> in recent years  <cit> , there is still relatively little known about the mechanism by which these peptides are processed in plants. based on previous work  <cit> , we believe that cyclotide precursors enter the secretory pathway where folding and disulfide bond formation occur before cleavage and cyclisation events release the mature cyclic peptides. the presence of putative endoplasmic reticulum  signal sequences in the precursors suggests that cyclotide domains probably fold in the er where the cysteine residues form three highly conserved disulfide bonds. after correct folding and disulfide bond formation, the precursor protein is processed by cleavage of two peptide bonds and the cyclotide domain is head-to-tail cyclised. candidate genes for these processes have been identified in this est sequencing project.

cyclotide precursor proteins
the cyclotide precursor proteins of o. affinis identified so far include an er signal sequence, a n-terminal pro-domain of variable length and sequences, followed by one to three cyclotide domains   <cit> . usually each cyclotide domain  is separated by a  <dig> amino acid region termed the n-terminal repeat  because it is relatively well conserved within these precursors. although not part of the mature cyclotide domain, it has been suggested that ntr sequences within the precursors might modulate protein folding  <cit> .

four cdna clones encoding cyclotide precursors have been isolated previously from o. affinis. named oak <dig> -  <dig>  they encode cyclotides kalata b <dig>  b3/b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> respectively . we identified  <dig> ests encoding oak <dig> ,  <dig> encoding oak <dig> , three ests encoding oak <dig>  and three ests encoding oak <dig> . maldi-tof mass spectrometry of leaf peptide extracts showed an abundance of these cyclotides consistent with the frequency of the corresponding ests ; that is, kalata b <dig> and kalata b <dig> are most abundant while kalatas b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> are less so. this result indicates that cyclotide precursor mrna expression levels correlate with peptide levels in leaves of o. affinis and have not been skewed by amplification of the library by pcr.

initially  <dig> ests were assembled into contig oa <dig> encoding oak <dig>  the precursor protein for kalata b <dig>  with 90% minimum match percentage. re-alignment by clustalw  <cit>  showed that ests within this contig can be divided into two subgroups: namely one subgroup of nine ests with 100% identity to the kalata b <dig> precursor oak <dig>  and another of four ests with 97% and 95% similarity to oak <dig> at the nucleotide and protein level, respectively. the major differences were found in the 5' untranslated region and at the beginning of the orf within the er signal domain. they are most probably variant copies of oak <dig>  potentially produced by gene duplication.

previous studies have employed mainly chemical peptide extractions, reverse phase-hplc and mass spectrometry to isolate cyclotide sequences  <cit> . however, only four cdna sequences for o. affinis cyclotide precursors have been determined  <cit>  among the eighteen characterised cyclotides using the approach described above  <cit> . because cyclotides precursors from o. affinis are only moderately conserved, with sequence identities of approximately 60%, it is difficult to develop a robust strategy for pcr amplification based on sequence similarity. in this est project, we identified a single est, contig oa <dig>  which encodes a previously unidentified putative bracelet cyclotide precursor, which we named oak <dig>  the cyclotide it encodes was named kalata b <dig>  this is the first bracelet cyclotide precursor cdna sequence identified in o. affinis; all other known cyclotide gene sequences from o. affinis belong to the möbius sub-class. möbius sub-class cyclotides contain a conceptual 'twist'  in their backbone, whereas bracelet cyclotides do not  <cit> . oa <dig> showed a high degree  of identity with leonia cymosa cycloviolin-d   <cit> , viola hederaceae cycloviolacin-h <dig>   <cit> , and melicytus ramiflorus mra <dig>  mra <dig> and mra <dig>   <cit> . the asn residue immediately after the mature cyclotide domain in oak <dig> is unusual and may affect processing. we confirmed the sequence of the oak <dig> est by independently cloning oak <dig> by rt-pcr with specific primers and leaf cdna.

the sequence of kalata b <dig> was compared to the characterised cyclotides from o. affinis and it possesses several residues that are conserved across all cyclotides , namely six cys residues and a gly residue at the n-terminus. typically, cyclotides contain a conserved glu in loop  <dig> , gly in loop  <dig> , and asn or asp at the c-terminus. a proline in loop  <dig> is only conserved in the möbius subfamily. this conservation still allows for the existence of a great diversity of cyclotide sequences; however it indicates that cyclotide processing for all precursors probably uses the same basic mechanism.

multiple sequence alignment of o. affinis cyclotides.

to establish whether oak5-encoded kalata b <dig> was detectable in the o. affinis cyclotide profile, maldi-tof mass spectrometry was employed. we did not observe a mass consistent with the calculated mass of kb <dig> in a peptide extract from o. affinis leaves . the inability to detect kb <dig> is the cyclotide profile could be due to oak <dig> mis-processing, but may also be because it falls below the level of detection. oak <dig> mrna is lowly expressed relative to the other oak genes and if at low levels kb <dig> may be being masked by other cyclotides.

in total,  <dig> ests encoding putative cyclotide precursors were isolated. this represents  <dig> % of all ests sequenced, and a substantial commitment of the o. affinis transcriptome to cyclotide biosynthesis. in o. affinis, cyclotides are produced in levels as high as  <dig> -  <dig> grams per kg wet weight  <cit> , but until now it was uncertain whether this high protein expression correlated with highly abundant mrna at the level of transcription. cyclotides have been purified and sequenced from decades-old dried herbarium samples , which indicates that cyclotides are remarkably stable in plants. the stability of cyclotides could have meant peptide levels slowly accumulated over the life of the developing plant eventually reaching high levels in adult plants, the stage at which most plants are used for studies. it is interesting to note that mrna expression levels correlate well with peptide level, suggesting cyclotides might be subject to turnover in planta.

disulfide formation and oxidative protein folding
previous studies show that six cysteine residues in cyclotide precursors form three disulfide bonds  <cit> . disulfide bonds are required for the stability and function of a large number of proteins and disulfide bond formation is essential for proper protein folding  <cit> . there are several systems linking hydrogen donors to an intermediary disulfide protein, namely the ferredoxin/thioredoxin system, the nadp/thioredoxin system and the glutathione/glutaredoxin system; each system acts to effect changes that alter the activity of target proteins. these systems are composed of reduced ferredoxin, thioredoxin, reduced glutathione, glutaredoxin, ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase, and nadp-thioredoxin reductase  <cit> . a related disulfide protein, protein disulfide isomerase  acts in protein assembly  <cit> .

an o. affinis pdi cdna clone  was isolated recently and shown to encode a protein that improves in vitro oxidative folding of kalata b <dig> at physiological ph  <cit> . in the current study several other ests involved in disulfide bond formation have been identified: oa <dig> and oa <dig> encoding putative thioredoxins, oa <dig> and oa <dig> encoding putative glutathione transferases, oa <dig> encoding a putative glutaredoxin as well as oa <dig> and oa <dig> encoding ferredoxins. these enzymes are potential candidates for cyclotide disulfide formation and protein folding in o. affinis.

thioredoxins are disulfide reductases that promote disulfide bond formation in vivo in the oxidised form, and glutaredoxins are disulfide bond-formation catalysts in e. coli  <cit> . the putative thioredoxin oa <dig> has 60% sequence similarity with thioredoxin m from populus trichocarpa , wheras oa <dig> has 58% similarity with thioredoxin x from arabidopsis . predicted protein products from both contigs contain features typical of thioredoxins; the conserved thioredoxin catalytic site motif , a characteristic tryptophan residue at the active thiol/disulfide site, and a structural motif thought to be involved in cell-to-cell transfer, which is typical of thioredoxins  <cit> . although glutaredoxins function in a similar way to thioredoxins, glutaredoxins have a more positive redox potential  <cit> . oa <dig>  encoding a putative glutaredoxin family protein, shares approximately 40% sequence identity with other plant glutaredoxins .

a number of other ests encoding predicted proteins involved in the regulation of redox environment were identified and included peroxiredoxins , and oxidoreductases . these enzymes typically maintain the redox environment which is crucial for proper disulfide bond formation in vivo  <cit> , and as such might have a role in the processing of cyclotides.

excision and ligation of cyclotide domain
the mechanism of excision and cyclisation that occurs to produce mature cyclotides from their precursor proteins remains unclear. excision of the cyclotide domain from the precursor and ligation of the newly formed n- and c-termini probably occurs after folding of the cyclotide domain, but possibly occurs synchronously with formation of the cyclised backbone  <cit> .

although the residues preceding the cyclotide domain are not highly conserved there is a string of conserved sequence flanking the c-terminal asn/asp of the mature cyclotide domain. some insight into the mechanism for carboxyl terminus processing has been gained   <cit> . a residue with a small side chain  usually follows the mature cyclotide domain and itself is followed by an absolutely conserved leucine residue. asparaginyl endopeptidases  are widespread in plants where they are also referred to as vacuolar processing enzymes , and specifically cleave peptide bonds on the c-terminal side of asn and, with less efficiency, asp  <cit> . the activity of aep is involved in cyclisation of kalata b <dig> in tobacco plants transiently transformed with the oak <dig> gene  <cit> . in oak <dig> transformed tobacco plants, aep catalyses protein backbone cyclisation by coupling asparaginyl bond hydrolysis at the c-terminus of the cyclotide domain with peptide bond ligation.

in the current study we identified an aep homolog from o. affinis , which shares up to 68% identity with other plant aeps . the putative aep from o. affinis has the active site "eaces", which is conserved in plant aeps ces)  <cit> . a possible site for self-cleavage of c-terminal propeptides is present at residue  <dig> , which is conserved in most of plant aeps  <cit> . this putative enzyme belongs to the vegetative-type according to genetic analysis. since the c-terminus of cyclotide precursors oak <dig>  oak <dig>  oak <dig> are asn, followed by gly, we believe aeps have an important role in cyclotide domain excision from the precursor proteins. we are currently investigating function of aeps on the cyclotide hydrolysis and cyclisation in o. affinis.

asparaginases are enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of asn to asp, releasing nh4+, and have an important role in protein metabolism  <cit> . a putative asparaginase, oa <dig> comprised of  <dig> ests, is one of the most highly expressed genes in o. affinis leaves according to this study  and shares up to 86% identity with other plant asparaginases . there are two pairs of cyclotides in o. affinis that differ from each other by an asn/asp change at the c-terminal residue . precursor cdnas for only one of each pair have been cloned and encode asn-ending cyclotides, but cdnas for their asp-ending counterpart have not yet been identified. the abundance of cdnas for an enzyme that catalyses a change between asn and asp could suggest that these cyclotides are not encoded by different gene products, rather they are produced as a result of post-translational modification.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we estimated the genome size of o. affinis using flow cytometry, and undertook an est sequencing project on o. affinis to identify candidates for in vivo cyclotide biosynthesis and cyclisation. we discovered that the holoploid genome size of o. affinis was one of the largest genomes of the rubiaceae family.  <dig>  high-quality ests were obtained and annotated representing  <dig> unique transcripts. o. affinis dedicated a substantial portion of its transcriptome to cyclotide production:  <dig> % of ests encoded cyclotides. we also discovered a new cdna encoding an unidentified cyclotide kalata b <dig> , the first cdna for a bracelet cyclotide in o. affinis. as the first sequencing project undertaken in o. affinis, this study has uncovered ests encoding genes that are potentially involved at each step of cyclotide production and processing, including several cyclotide precursor proteins , folding and disulfide bond formation, regulation of redox environment, and proteolytic processing. previous attempts to express cyclotides by a transgene in model plants displayed low efficiency and mis-processing; therefore further investigation of the enzymes identified in this study could lead to a deeper understanding of cyclotide processing and improved outcomes for recombinant cyclotide production in plants, which will advance the application of cyclotides for pharmaceutical outcomes and for the protection of crop plants from insect pests.
