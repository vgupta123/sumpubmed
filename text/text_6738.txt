BACKGROUND
the family tetranychidae   includes ~ <dig> species, many of which are of agronomic importance  <cit> , such as tetranychus urticae, panonychus citri, and p. ulmi; the former is a worldwide pest of many plant species including several economically important agricultural crops, while the latter two are important fruit plant  pests. spider mites are often difficult to manage because of their ability to rapidly develop resistance to various acaricides  <cit> . it has been reported that the resistance of t. urticae to the acaricide bifenazate is highly correlated with the remarkable mutations in the mitochondrial encoded cytochrome b   <cit> . in addition, several acaricides, such as acequinocyl, fluacrypyrim  <cit> , and meti-acaricides   <cit> , which are now in widespread use globally, target mitochondrial proteins. unravelling and comparing mitochondrial genomes of spider mites will not only increase our understanding of the molecular evolution of acaricide-resistance genes, but also help to develop new acaricides uniquely targeting mitochondrial genes.

during the last  <dig> years, arthropod mitochondrial genomes have been extensively sequenced due to the improvements of genomic technologies and the interest in mitochondrial genome organization and evolution  <cit> . mitochondrial genome sequences not only contain more information than the shorter sequences of single genes, but also provide larger data sets of genome-level features such as gene rearrangements and rna secondary structures  <cit> . to date, the complete mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced from  <dig> acari species. among these,  <dig> species belong to the superorder of parasitiformes while the remaining  <dig> species belong to the superorder of acariformes. most mitochondrial genomes are about  <dig> kb circular molecules and encode  <dig> genes including  <dig> protein-coding genes , two rrna genes , and  <dig> trna genes , which is typical of metazoa  <cit> . however, the mitochondrial genomes of leptotrombidium pallidum and metaseiulus occidentalis possess duplicated genes  <cit> , and the mtdna of the sexual oribatid mite steganacarus magnus lacks  <dig> trna genes  <cit> . in addition, gene rearrangement, reverse base composition, and atypical trna genes are frequently present in acari, especially for the acariformes, such as in the mite genera leptotrombidium  <cit> , and dermatophagoides  <cit> , and also in the mite species p. ulmi and t. urticae  <cit> .

generally, mitochondrial gene content and gene order are highly conserved at the lower taxonomic rank , but gene content variation and arrangement have reported for the genera leptotrombidium  <cit>  and dermatophagoides  <cit> . in addition, the inference of mite mitochondrial trna genes may be extremely difficult and even error prone, especially when comparative data is absent  <cit> . thus, more mitochondrial genomes from closely related species will improve the accuracy of annotations for mitochondrial genomes, which will also greatly improve our understanding of molecular evolution and phylogenetic relationships  <cit> . in this study, we sequenced and analyzed the complete mitochondrial genome of the citrus red mite p. citri , an important citrus pest with a worldwide distribution, and provide a comparison to other acari.

RESULTS
genome content and organization
the mitochondrial genome of p. citri is a typical circular dna molecule of  <dig>  bp in length . this genome is only  <dig> bp larger than that of another p. citri strain   <cit>  and slightly smaller than those of the same-family species t. urticae   <cit>  and p. ulmi  . to date, the mitochondrial genome of p. citri is the smallest within all sequenced acari and other chelicerate genomes available in the genbank . its relatively small size is primarily due to the significant size reduction of pcgs, rrnl, and the putative control region  in comparison with other acari . the mitochondrial genome of p. citri contains all  <dig> genes  which are typically present in metazoan mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . among these,  <dig> genes  are located on the majority strand  and the others on the minority strand  . gene overlaps have been found at  <dig> gene junctions and have involved a total of  <dig> bp; the longest overlap  exists between trnv and trni. in addition to the large non-coding region, several small non-coding intergenic spacers are present in the p. citri mitochondrial genome and are spread over ten positions, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp.

the largest non-coding region, which presumably functions as the mitochondrial control region, is  <dig> bp long and is present between cox <dig> and nad <dig> . this region is completely comprised of adenines and thymines  and is the third smallest among all sequenced mitochondrial genomes within acari; only those of p. ulmi  and t. urticae  are slightly smaller . the maximum size difference found in the a + t-rich regions across all sequenced acari mitochondrial genomes is  <dig>  bp, indicating that strong size variation among acari mitochondrial genomes is significantly correlated to the a + t-rich regions . this result is concordant with previous findings from other chelicerates  <cit>  and insects  <cit> . in fact, the a + t-rich region has been identified as the source of size variation in the entire mitochondrial genome, usually due to the presence of a variable copy number of repetitive elements  <cit> . the relative location of the a + t-rich region also varies greatly among acari with the ancestral pattern of arthropods being between rrns and trni  <cit> .

previous studies of insect a + t-rich region have identified extensive conserved sequence stretches and hypothetical secondary structure features, which are supposed to be responsible for the control of replication and transcription of the mtdna  <cit> . in particular, one of the most conserved sequence stretches discovered in hexapod a + t-rich region seems to be an array of thymines , which are important signalling sites necessary for the initiation of the replication process. in the j-strand of p. citri mitochondrial genome, a short t-stretch  has been found six nucleotides away from cox <dig>  while a slightly longer t-stretch  has been recognized in the n-strand  <dig> nucleotides away from nad <dig> . similar t-stretch  is also found in the j-strand of p. ulmi a + t-rich region, but no t-stretch can be found in the n-strand of p. ulmi and on both strand of t. urticae . it has been shown that the t-stretches vary in length, e.g., 4- <dig> nucleotides in the collembolan species, and > <dig> bp in holometabola  <cit> . while the minimum length of t-stretch is not known, long t-stretches  seem to be indispensable for the replication initiation of mtdna  <cit> . therefore, other sequences instead of the t-stretches may provide essential signals for the replication initiation of mtdna in the species that do not possess the long t-stretches, e.g., locusta migratoria  <cit> . however, the a + t-rich regions are highly variable among p. citri, p. ulmi and t. urticae , and only several short conserved sequences can be recognized . on the other hand, the stem-loop secondary structure in the a + t-rich region may also be involved in the initiation of the replication of animal mtdna  <cit> . the a + t-rich region of the three spider mites can be folded into stable stem-loop secondary structures : two stem-loop structures are present in both p. citri and p. ulmi, whereas only one is found in t. urticae. it has been previously suggested that the sequence flanking the stem-loop structure is highly conserved among arthropods: a tata motif in the 5'-flanking sequence and a gat motif in the 3'-flanking sequence  <cit> . both motifs are presumed to have a functional significance in the replication and transcription of the mtdna  <cit> , but are not present in the a + t-rich regions of p. citri, p. ulmi, and t. urticae .

the gene order of the p. citri mitochondrial genome is identical to those of p. ulmi and t. urticae , but differs markedly from those of all other known acari and chelicerates . compared to limulus polyphemus, which is considered the representative ground pattern for arthropod mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , a series of gene rearrangements have occurred in the evolutionary history of p. citri; only nine of the  <dig> gene boundaries in l. polyphemus are conserved in p. citri. the most striking features are the inversions of two segments, which change the relative position and transcriptional orientation of six pcgs  and two trna genes ; trnd may invert before or after the rearrangement of the fragment cox3-cox <dig>  all  <dig> trna genes and two rrna genes are also severely rearranged, translocated and/or inverted, but do not show any particular patterns.

so far, the complete mitochondrial genomes of  <dig> species belonging to acari have been sequenced and they exhibit great variation of gene order . among them,  <dig> of the  <dig> species belonging to the superorder of parasitiformes  share the same gene order as the ancestral chelicerates, while all of the  <dig> species belonging to the superorder of acariformes are highly rearranged  <cit> , suggesting that these gene arrangements within acari are independently derived  <cit> . the rearrangement events  from other acari  do not seem to be more parsimonious to produce the gene arrangement of p. citri . it is clear that the unique mitochondrial genome arrangement present in p. citri, p. ulmi, and t. urticae likely occurred after tetranychidae diverged from other acari, or after acariformes split from parasitiformes and opilioacariformes, because this feature is not shared with any other acari. rearrangements of the mitochondrial genome should be relatively rare events at the evolutionary scale, and, therefore, provide a powerful tool to delimit deep divergences among some metazoan lineages  <cit> . however, the mitochondrial gene rearrangement phenomenon seems to occur frequently and independently in acari mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , possibly restricting the phylogenetic applications in recovering the evolutionary relationships between superorders within the acari. on the other hand, gene order appears to be linked to taxonomic relatedness at the lower rank . for example, the relationship between prostriate ticks and metastriate ticks can be distinguished by gene arrangements  <cit> .

base composition and codon usage
as is the case in other acari mitochondrial genome sequences, the nucleotide composition of the p. citri mtdna is also biased toward a and t . a comparative analysis of a + t% vs at-skew and g + c% vs gc-skew across all available complete mitochondrial genomes of acari and l. polyphemus is shown in figure  <dig>  the overall a + t content  of p. citri is similar to those of p. ulmi  and t. urticae , but much higher than the average a + t content of acari mitochondrial genomes  as well as that of l. polyphemus .

metazoan mitochondrial genomes usually present a clear strand bias in nucleotide composition  <cit> . in detail, the j-strand is biased in favour of adenine and cytosine, while the n-strand consequently contains more thymine and guanine. the strand bias can be measured as at- and gc-skews  <cit> . the average at-skew of acari mitochondrial genome is  <dig>  ±  <dig> , ranging from - <dig>  in dermatophagoides farinae to  <dig>  in walchia hayashii, whereas the p. citri mitochondrial genome exhibits a slight at-skew  . the marked at-skew values are shared by the mitochondrial genomes of d. farinae , d. pteronyssinus , unionicola foili , and w. hayashii .

the average gc-skew of acari mitochondrial genome is - <dig>  ±  <dig>  and most of gc-skew values are negative, similar to those typically found in most metazoan mitochondrial genomes. however, as has been reported for other arthropods  <cit> , six mite species in four genera are characterized by a reversal of gc-skew: dermatophagoides  <cit> , phytoseiulus  <cit> , varroa  <cit> , and panonychus . this reversal of the strand bias could be the result of inversion of the control region  <cit> , which contains all initiation sites for replication and transcription of the mtdna  <cit> . therefore, an inversion of the control region is expected to produce a global reversal of asymmetric mutational constraints in the mtdna, with time resulting in a complete reversal of strand compositional bias  <cit> . in the p. citri mtdna most genes encoded on the j-strand show a positive gc-skew at the fourfold degenerate third codon position which is inverted to the common pattern and probably indicates a reversal of the control region . furthermore, this reverse strand bias may occur after the genus panonychus split from the family tetranychidae, because t. urticae, belonging to the same-family  with p. citri and p. ulmi, shows a usual gc-skew , as found in most of acari.

the analyses of the base composition at each codon position of the concatenated  <dig> pcgs of p. citri show that the third codon positions  have an a + t content higher than that of the first  and second  codon positions, as has also been found in other sequenced acari . the relative synonymous codon frequencies  reveal that codons harbouring a or t in the third position are always overused as compared to other synonymous codons in the p. citri mitochondrial genome , as found in other sequenced acari  and other chelicerates  <cit> . among  <dig> amino-acid encoding codons of invertebrate mitochondrial code  <cit> , the p. citri mitochondrial genome uses  <dig> codons and never utilizes the five g + c rich codons. furthermore, the four at-rich codons ttt-phe , tta-leu , att-ile , and ata-met  are the most frequently used codons in the p. citri pcgs, . comparative analyses among other sequenced acari also reveal a similar pattern with the exceptions of d. farinae and s. magnus, and the values range from  <dig> % in leptotrombidium akamushi to  <dig> % in p. ulmi . this noted difference in the four most frequently used codons between acari seems to be directly linked to the overall a + t content , as reported in other chelicerates and insects  <cit> .

a total of  <dig>  codons for p. citri are analyzed, excluding the start and stop codons. aa, amino acid; rscu, relative synonymous codon usage; n = frequency of each codon. % = n/ <dig> 

protein-coding genes
the total length of all the  <dig> pcgs is  <dig>  bp, and accounts for  <dig> % of the entire length of p. citri mitochondrial genome . the overall a + t content of pcgs is  <dig> %, ranging from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . all the pcgs start with atn codons, which is typical for metazoan mitochondria  <cit> : one  with atc, three  with ata, four  with atg, and the other five with att . eight pcgs terminate with the conventional stop codons taa  or tag , whereas the remaining five have incomplete stop codons t. the presence of an incomplete stop codon is common in metazoan mitochondrial genomes  <cit>  and these truncated stop codons are presumed to be completed via post-transcriptional polyadenylation  <cit> . a comparison of codon numbers across the sequenced acari mitochondrial genomes shows that all pcgs are highly variable in length, covering a range from  <dig>  bp in p. citri to  <dig>  bp in m. occidentalis . notably, the m. occidentalis mitochondrial genome has the largest number of codons within chelicerates due to the duplication of many pcgs, even though nad <dig> and nad <dig> are lost  <cit> . however, a recent study has found that the m. occidentalis mtdna is smaller than originally suggested, and nad <dig> is not lacking but is in fact located between nad4l and rrns  <cit> . p. citri, p. ulmi, and t. urticae have a reduction in mean content of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  codons per pcg, respectively, making them the three smallest mitochondrial genomes within acari.

the  <dig> pcgs of p. citri were combined with those of other acari to investigate the evolutionary patterns among pcgs in acari. the nucleotide substitution rates per site greatly vary among genes . in this respect, nad <dig> shows the highest value , followed by nad <dig>  while cox <dig> appears to be the lowest. the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  of cox <dig> is the highest, but its number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site  is much lower, while this value for nad <dig> is the highest. therefore, at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, cox <dig> is the slowest evolving protein, making it a useful marker for investigating phylogenetic relationships at higher taxonomic levels. however, a dna barcoding approach based on cox <dig> sequence diversity has been utilized for identification of closely related species  <cit> . by contrast, due to the highest divergence, nad <dig> can be used as an effective molecular marker to analyze intraspecific relationships and reveal relationships between populations within the same acari species. the ks of each pcg has a relatively high value compared to ka, which may indicate that these genes are evolving under purifying selection  <cit> . notably, nad <dig> accumulates amino acid substitutions twice as fast as the acari mitochondrial average, possibly implying positive selection acting at nad <dig> or due to relax selection. furthermore, a negative correlation has been found between the ka/ks and the gc content of each pcg , indicating that the variation of gc content probably causes the different evolutionary patterns among genes  <cit> .

transfer and ribosomal rna genes
the two genes encoding the large and small rrna subunits  are located between trne and trnr, and between trny and trng . both genes are encoded on the j-strand, as in p. ulmi, t. urticae  <cit> , m. occidentalis  <cit> , and phytoseiulus persimilis  <cit> , and in the two genera dermatophagoides  <cit>  and leptotrombidium   <cit> . in contrast, in the mitochondrial genomes of other acari and most species of chelicerates and arthropods, both rrna genes are encoded on the n-strand  <cit> . we annotate the 5'- and 3'-ends of two rrna genes as the first nucleotide downstream and upstream of corresponding trna genes, respectively, and the size of the rrnl and rrns of p. citri are  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp long, respectively . the a + t contents of rrnl and rrns  are similar to those of p. ulmi  and t. urticae , but much higher than the average value of acari . the boundaries of some trna genes are incorrectly delimited in p. ulmi, t. urticae and another strain of p. citri . this aspect affects the boundaries of rrnl and rrns in these taxa. thus we re-annotate also these genes . the size of rrnl and rrns of p. citri is similar to those of another p. citri strain , p. ulmi  and t. urticae . the size of rrnl of p. citri is the second shortest among all sequenced acari mitochondrial genomes, whereas the size of rrns is slightly larger than those of other acariform mites , but are much shorter than those found in the parasitiformes  .

the secondary structures of the two rrna genes inferred for p. citri have similar stem-loop structures as those published for l. pallidum  <cit>  and d. pteronyssinus  <cit>  . all the helices of the rrnl found in l. pallidum are present in p. citri; however, three helices  found in d. pteronyssinus are not present in p. citri. the lack of helix c <dig> is largely due to the size reduction of the p. citri rrnl compared to the d. pteronyssinus rrnl, and the deleted nucleotides are mainly located at 5'-end. the helix h <dig> is similar in size to those of l. pallidum and d. pteronyssinus, but appears to be lost in p. ulmi and t. urticae, though the length of the three spider mite species is similar. compared to the 5'-end, the 3'-end of rrnl structure is more conserved among p. citri, p. ulmi, and t. urticae , especially for the helices g16-g <dig>  in addition, the loop region of helix h <dig> is highly conserved not only in tetranychidae, but also in the other two mite genera leptotrombidium  <cit>  and dermatophagoides  <cit> . like in l. pallidum and d. pteronyssinus, one compound helix replaces three helices  of the drosophila yakuba rrns  <cit> . in the middle of rrns, two helices  are present in p. citri, which is more similar to that of s. magnus  <cit> , but only a compound helix  is present in l. pallidum and d. pteronyssinus. in addition, the helix  <dig> not present in l. pallidum is found in the rrns of p. citri; this helix is also found in d. pteronyssinus. the most conserved sequences of rrns among tetranychidae are found in the helices  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .

out of  <dig> trna genes usually present in metazoan mitochondrial genomes, only  <dig> trna genes can be detected in the p. citri mitochondrial genome by trnascan-se  <cit>  and/or arwen  <cit> . the remaining nine trna genes  were identified by manually aligning unassigned sequences to known trna genes from t. urticae and p. ulmi, as suggested by masta and boore  <cit> . all  <dig> trna sequences were aligned with those of p. ulmi and t. urticae, and show high similarity among tetranychidae, especially for the anticodon stem . however, only eight trna genes  of both p. ulmi and t. urticae are correctly annotated on genbank. among the remaining trna genes, the boundaries of ten trna genes of another p. citri strain  and t. urticae , and  <dig> trna genes of p. ulmi  were incorrect on genbank , because most of them appear to lack the sequences to form the canonical amino acid acceptor stem  or at least one d- or t-arm . the trnk of p. ulmi is misannotated on the j-strand, but in this location an unpaired anticodon stem is found. in fact, the majority of the nucleotides of trnk among tetranychidae are highly conserved , and only when trnk of p. ulmi is on the n-strand, as in p. citri and t. urticae, can canonical secondary structure of trna genes be found . therefore, we re-annotate these trna genes to incorporate the conserved structural features of trna genes  , and present their secondary structures in additional file  <dig> 

eleven trna genes overlap with adjacent genes in a total of  <dig> bp, as in another p. citri strain, whereas ten and nine gene overlaps are present in p. ulmi and t. urticae, respectively . the most truncated trna genes are trnq, trna, and trni in p. citri, whose sequences overlap the trnl <dig>  nad <dig> and trnv on the same or opposite strand for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nucleotides, respectively . the similar situations are found in p. ulmi and t. urticae . the similar amount of gene overlap on the same strand has been reported for the spider habronattus oregonensis  <cit>  and the house dust mite d. pteronyssinus  <cit> . furthermore, if the three trna genes  do not overlap adjacent genes, they lack the sequences to form either the usual amino acid acceptor stem or at least one d- or t-arm. in addition, the nucleotides present in the anticodon arm of the three trna genes are highly conserved among tetranychidae . other gene overlaps found in trna genes of tetranychidae are not more than five nucleotides . the average size  of trna genes found in p. citri is similar to those of p. ulmi  and t. urticae , reducing the potential of trna genes to form a typical metazoan cloverleaf structure . in fact, the average size of trna genes of acariformes  is considerably shorter with respect to those of all species of parasitiformes  as well as l. polyphemus , indicating that atypical trna genes may be a common phenomenon in acariformes.

out of  <dig> trna genes, only three trna genes  can potentially fold into a typical cloverleaf structure, whereas all the remaining  <dig> trna genes appear to lack the sequence to code the d- or t-arm , as found in p. ulmi and t. urticae . in at least  <dig> trna genes, the t-arm has been substituted by a loop of variable size , whereas another six trna genes  show a d-replacement loop instead of the d-arm . with the exception of trnp, which seems to be lost the d-arm in p. ulmi, all trna genes have similar secondary structures among tetranychidae . the loss of the d-arm in trns <dig>  has been considered a typical feature of metazoan mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . the absence of the t-arm seems to be a common feature for the trna genes of chelicerates from the orders of the araneae, scorpiones, thelyphonida, and acariform acari  <cit> , whereas other orders  possess typical metazoan cloverleaf trnas  <cit> . on the other hand, the loss of the d-arm of trna genes is an uncommon circumstance but has been reported for a few of mitochondrial trna genes from chelicerates, including the scorpion centruroides limpidus  <cit> , the sea spiders nymphon gracile  <cit>  and achelia bituberculata  <cit> , and five mites belonging to two genera leptotrombidium  <cit>  and dermatophagoides  <cit> . it has been shown that in the nematode ascaris suum the trna genes that lack either the d- or t-arm are functional  <cit> , but functional trna genes that lack both the d- and t-arms have not been found before. however, trna genes that lack both t- and d-arms have been reported for the sea spider a. bituberculata   <cit>  and the scorpion c. limpidus   <cit> . in the american house dust mite d. farinae, some trna genes  lacking the d-arm have a small  and thermodynamically unstable t-arm, suggesting that these trna genes may have lost both d- and t-arms in reality  <cit> . in this study, we also found that some inferred t-arms  or d-arms  were short . in particular, the inferred d-arm of trny in p. ulmi and t. urticae  is shorter than in p. citri, whereas the d-arm of trnp is lost in p. ulmi, casting doubt on their identity as d-arms. therefore, further experiments are needed to investigate whether these truly trna genes lack both d- and t-arms and if so, whether they are functional.

twenty of  <dig> trna genes have a five bp well-paired anticodon stem, and the remaining two trna genes  have a single mismatch within this stem. all trna genes, but trni, have the seven canonical nucleotides in the anticodon loop, whereas trni has eight nucleotides in this region, which is also found for trni of p. ulmi and t. urticae . these noncanonical anticodon loops are not common, but have also been reported for the house dust mite d. pteronyssinus   <cit> , the scorpion mesobuthus gibbosus   <cit> , and the wild two-humped camelus bactrianus ferus   <cit> . only nine of the  <dig> trna genes have a completely matched seven bp aminoacyl acceptor stem , while the remaining  <dig> trna genes have 1- <dig> bp mismatches in this stem. this type of a mis-paired acceptor stem seems to be a common phenomenon for trna genes of chelicerates , and a posttranscriptional rna editing mechanism has been proposed to maintain function of these trna genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of the spider mite, p. citri . this mitochondrial genome in size is similar to those of other spider mites, p. ulmi and t. urticae, and is the smallest among all sequenced acari and other chelicerate genomes. the gene order of the p. citri mtdna is identical to those of p. ulmi and t. urticae, but markedly differs from those of other chelicerates by a large number of gene inversions and/or translocations, suggesting that rearrangements occurred after tetranychidae diverged from other acari. comparative analyses among acari mitochondrial genomes show that the genome size, gene order, gene content, codon usage, and base composition are strongly variable. the acari mitochondrial nad <dig> exhibits a faster amino acid substitution rate than the average, and the g + c content variation causes the different evolutionary patterns among genes of acari mitochondrial genomes. most trna genes present in p. citri are minimal and atypical, lacking the d- or t-arm, as found in p. ulmi and t. urticae. while extremely short and unusual trna genes seem to be common for acariform mites, further experimental evidence is needed.
