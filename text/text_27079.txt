BACKGROUND
the epidermis of the skin serves as a mechanical and water permeability barrier essential for terrestrial life  and is composed primarily of epidermal keratinocytes. these keratinocytes stratify to form several layers. the deepest layer, the stratum basalis or basal layer comprises proliferating cells that continuously divide to regenerate cells lost to the environment. as the cells migrate upward into the first differentiated layer, the stratum spinousum or spinous layer, they cease proliferating and begin to express the intermediate filament proteins, the mature keratins  <dig> and  <dig>  this early differentiation is followed by a late differentiation program in the stratum granulosum or granular layer, which is marked by the expression of other structural proteins, such as filaggrin and loricrin, and by increased activity of the enzyme, transglutaminase, which forms highly durable γ-glutamyl-ε-lysyl bonds to cross-link the proteins into a tough and resistant shell underneath the plasma membrane. at the boundary of the granular layer and the outermost stratum corneum, or cornified layer, the keratinocytes terminally differentiate, degrading their nuclei and other organelles and releasing lamellar bodies, the lipid contents of which form a water-impermeant barrier. the squames, the flattened remnants of the keratinocytes, and the lipids from the lamellar bodies form a sort of brick and mortar, to prevent water loss, microbial invasion and/or other mechanical insults .

 <dig> -dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  is a known regulator of this process of keratinocyte growth and differentiation . in vitro,  <dig> d <dig> inhibits keratinocyte proliferation and stimulates the expression of numerous keratinocyte differentiation markers . in vivo a physiologic role for  <dig> d <dig> in regulating keratinocyte differentiation is suggested by several lines of evidence:  keratinocytes express both the 25-hydroxylase and the 1α-hydroxylase which converts inactive vitamin d <dig> to its active  <dig> -dihydroxy metabolite ;  receptors for  <dig> d <dig> are present in the skin and in epidermal keratinocytes in vitro  <cit> ; and  vitamin d receptor null mice exhibit altered skin function, characterized by abnormal hair follicles and reduced expression of several keratinocyte differentiation markers  <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> d <dig> and its structural analogs have been used as effective treatments for psoriasis, a human skin disease characterized by inflammation and by hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes .

8-chloro-cyclic-adenosine monophosphate  is known to inhibit growth and to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells  <cit> , suggesting its potential utility as an anti-cancer drug. indeed, phase i trials with 8-cl-camp have been performed  and phase ii trials are in progress  <cit> . however, the mechanisms by which this agent acts are incompletely understood, and several investigators have proposed that an 8-cl-camp metabolite, 8-chloro-adenosine  is the active anti-proliferative compound  <cit> . indeed, 8-cl-ado has been shown to inhibit growth in a variety of cell types  <cit> .

previously, we demonstrated that 8-cl-ado arrests the growth of primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes without triggering differentiation  <cit> . thus, 8-cl-ado functions in an analogous fashion to transforming growth factor-β , which also triggers growth arrest, but not differentiation,, of keratinocytes . in contrast with a polypeptide such as tgf-β, 8-cl-ado, as a small molecule rather than a protein, could potentially be taken orally or applied topically to skin. thus, 8-cl-ado may represent a novel therapy for treatment of skin disorders, such as psoriasis, actinic keratoses and basal and squamous cell carcinomas, characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. one potential problem, however, is that tgf-β also inhibits the expression of differentiation markers elicited by other differentiating agents  <cit> . since another characteristic typical of hyperproliferative skin diseases such as psoriasis is impaired differentiation  <cit> , a therapy that inhibits both proliferation and differentiation would be less than ideal.

to determine whether 8-cl-ado, as a potent keratinocyte growth arrestor, could potentially be used to treat hyperproliferative skin diseases in combination with a current treatment, we investigated the effect of 8-cl-ado on  <dig> d3-induced inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation and stimulation of keratinocyte differentiation. we found that low concentrations of 8-cl-ado acted additively with  <dig> d <dig> to inhibit dna synthesis, without affecting the ability of  <dig> d <dig> to enhance keratin  <dig> expression, a marker of early differentiation, or transglutaminase activity, a marker of late differentiation. thus, our results suggest that a combination therapy with  <dig> d <dig> and 8-cl-ado could potentially be an effective treatment for hyperproliferative skin disorders including psoriasis, actinic keratosis and non-melanoma skin cancers.

RESULTS
to determine if 8-cl-ado could function with the growth inhibiting agent  <dig> d <dig> to enhance its antiproliferative effect, we incubated primary epidermal keratinocytes for  <dig> hours with various concentrations of 8-cl-ado in the presence and absence of low concentrations of  <dig> d <dig> prior to assessing effects on de novo dna synthesis as measured by thymidine incorporation into dna. as shown in figure 1a, 8-cl-ado inhibited thymidine incorporation at concentrations of 5– <dig> μm with an estimated half-maximal inhibitory concentration  of  <dig> μm. this value agrees well with our previously determined ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm  <cit> . in agreement with previous reports  <cit> ,  <dig> d <dig> also inhibited dna synthesis at concentrations of  <dig> to  <dig> nm with an estimated ic <dig> of approximately  <dig> nm . as shown in figure  <dig>  when the two agents were combined, their effect on dna synthesis appeared to be additive, as evidenced by the comparable slopes of the thymidine incorporation curves at the three different concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> nm  <dig> d <dig>  the combination of  <dig> or  <dig> μm 8-cl-ado with  <dig> nm  <dig> d <dig> yielded a greater inhibition than 8-cl-ado alone, and conversely, the combined effect of  <dig> and  <dig> μm 8-cl-ado with  <dig> nm  <dig>  2d <dig> was significantly larger than  <dig> nm  <dig> d <dig> alone. importantly, the combination of  <dig> nm  <dig> d <dig> with  <dig> μm 8-cl-ado produced an inhibition of thymidine incorporation that was significantly greater than that elicited by either agent alone. indeed, the inhibition elicited by  <dig> μm 8-cl-ado and  <dig> nm  <dig> d <dig> was comparable to the inhibition produced by  <dig> nm  <dig> d <dig> alone . thus, our results suggest that not only does 8-cl-ado not prevent the growth inhibitory action of  <dig> d <dig>  but, in fact, the two agents seem to act in an additive fashion to more effectively inhibit keratinocyte proliferation.

tgf-β, another agent that, like 8-cl-ado, induces growth arrest but not differentiation of keratinocytes , can inhibit the ability of differentiating agents to elicit keratinocyte differentiation  <cit> . however, for an agent to have therapeutic potential as a treatment for hyperproliferative skin disorders, such an inhibition of differentiation would be counterproductive to its efficacy as a medication. to determine if 8-cl-ado also inhibited keratinocyte differentiation, we investigated whether 8-cl-ado inhibited the ability of  <dig> d <dig> to induce the late differentiation marker, transglutaminase activity. for this experiment we chose the concentrations of 8-cl-ado  and  <dig> d <dig>  shown in figure  <dig> to produce a greater growth inhibition than either agent alone. as illustrated in figure  <dig>   <dig> μm 8-cl-ado alone had little or no effect on transglutaminase activity, as reported previously  <cit> . on the other hand,  <dig> nm  <dig> d <dig> significantly elevated transglutaminase activity by approximately 75%. the combination of 8-cl-ado and  <dig> d3was not significantly different from  <dig> d <dig> alone, with a significant approximate 60% increase relative to the control value. thus, our results indicate that 8-cl-ado did not prevent the differentiative effect of  <dig> d <dig>  suggesting that these two agents might be combined to treat keratinocyte hyperproliferative disorders, such as psoriasis.

transglutaminase activity is a marker of late keratinocyte differentiation. we also examined the effect of 8-cl-ado on a marker of early keratinocyte differentiation, namely keratin  <dig> protein expression, using an even higher concentration of 8-cl-ado . western analysis demonstrated that  <dig> d <dig> induced an approximate 45% increase in keratin  <dig> protein levels with the combination of  <dig> d <dig> and 8-cl-ado producing a comparable 46% increase . thus, early differentiation in response to  <dig> d <dig> also was not affected by 8-cl-ado. interestingly, however, in contrast to previous results  <cit> , in these experiments 8-cl-ado alone elicited a small but significant increase in keratin  <dig> protein expression . the reason for this disparity is unclear but may result from differences in the lot of anti-keratin  <dig> antibody used in the western analysis and/or the increased sensitivity of the method used for detecting and quantifying immunoreactive protein in this work.

most current treatments for psoriasis suffer from one or more disadvantages including lack of efficacy, contraindications due to deleterious side effects and/or aesthetic deficiencies . indeed, monotherapies tend to be less efficacious than combination therapies with two or more agents used concurrently, sequentially or in a rotational fashion . treatment with  <dig> d <dig> and its analogs has proven successful, although the possibility of toxicity as the result of  <dig> d3's ability to affect calcium metabolism has led to the search for topically effective analogs with little or no effect on serum calcium levels . if the amount of  <dig> d <dig>  required for treatment could be reduced, this decrease in dosage would presumably minimize systemic effects on calcium, which is the primary dose-limiting factor in the use of  <dig> d <dig> analogs in the treatment of psoriasis  <cit> . thus, our results indicating that 8-cl-ado enhances the growth inhibitory effect of  <dig> d <dig>  a known keratinocyte differentiating agent and possible treatment for psoriasis  <cit> , suggests the potential for combination therapy. moreover, the fact that 8-cl-ado does not interfere with the promotion of differentiation by  <dig> d <dig> further supports the possible combined use of these two agents for treatment of hyperproliferative skin disorders.

several lines of evidence suggest that 8-cl-ado is not simply acting through cyototoxicity to inhibit keratinocyte growth. first, we have previously shown that 8-cl-ado growth arrests keratinocytes in the g0/g <dig> phase of the cell cycle with no increase in the sub-g0/g <dig>  population of cells  <cit> . second, we also showed that the effect of 8-cl-ado to inhibit proliferation is reversible in that washout of the compound returned dna synthesis essentially to basal  levels  <cit> . finally, in this report we demonstrate that 8-cl-ado did not inhibit the  <dig> d3-stimulated increase in transglutaminase activity  or keratin  <dig> protein expression . together, these results indicate that 8-cl-ado is acting in a specific manner to decrease keratinocyte proliferation.

nevertheless, the mechanism by which 8-cl-ado exerts its growth inhibitory effects in keratinocytes is not clear. our previous results indicate that 8-cl-ado must enter the cells to trigger growth arrest, since inhibiting uptake with an adenosine transporter, nbti, prevented the arrest in the g0/g <dig> phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . we also reported in a prior publication that 8-cl-ado induced the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p <dig>  <cit> , which is known to contribute to growth arrest in keratinocytes and other cell types . however, other investigators have reported 8-cl-ado-mediated inhibitory effects on rna synthesis and the levels of cellular atp  <cit> . clearly, further research is necessary to define the pathways used by 8-cl-ado to regulate keratinocyte proliferation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data show that 8-cl-ado functions with the keratinocyte-differentiating agent  <dig> d <dig> to inhibit keratinocyte proliferation without altering the ability of  <dig> d <dig> to induce differentiation. thus, our results support the possibility of using 8-cl-ado alone or in combination with differentiating agents such as  <dig> d <dig> or its analogs to treat hyperproliferative keratinocyte disorders including psoriasis.
