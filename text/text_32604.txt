BACKGROUND
poultry accounts for almost half of all meat consumed in the uk, with  <dig> million chickens,  <dig> million turkeys,  <dig> million ducks and  <dig>  geese a year supplied by over  <dig> poultry farms  <cit> . their production can be adversely affected by infection with avian specific viruses such as infectious bursal disease virus , infectious bronchitis virus  and newcastle virus  . poultry can also serve as the source of zoonotic, or potentially zoonotic, infections with viruses such as h5n <dig> and h7n <dig>  transmitted to humans through contact with poultry. to reduce the threat to the global food supply and to minimize the risk of zoonotic events, there is an ongoing need to better understand the biology of avian viral infections, the mechanism of natural resistance  and the characterization of the biological factors that might be involved.

interferon inducible transmembrane  proteins are effectors of the immune system widely involved in restricting entry into cells of a broad range of viruses including influenza viruses, ebola and zika . in chickens, four ifitm genes have been annotated to date by the chicken gene nomenclature consortium , namely chifitm <dig> , chifitm <dig> , chifitm <dig>  and chifitm <dig> . although not yet annotated by the cgnc, we have previously shown the existence of chifitm <dig>  and suggested a hypothetical genetic structure of the locus based on the human syntenic genome region  <cit> .

as ifn-stimulated genes , ifitm abundance within a cell increases following activation of the type  <dig> ifn signaling pathway in response to the detection of pathogen associated molecular patterns  such as viral nucleic acid in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. in addition, binding of the ifnα/β to their cell surface receptors induces translocation of the transcription factor complex ifn-stimulated gene factor  <dig>  into the nucleus  <cit> . this induces the transcription of several isgs, among which are the ifitm genes. the ifitm proteins target the final stages of viral entry by preventing fusion of the viral and cellular membranes  <cit> . this mechanism also reflects the localization of the human ifitm <dig> and ifitm <dig> which are found predominantly in intracellular membrane compartments such as late endosomes and lysosomes  <cit> . it is suggested that the membrane-defined site of fusion, namely plasma membrane and endosomes, is critical for the antiviral activity of these proteins  <cit> .

while genetics and cell biology of the human ifitms has been extensively characterized, lack of an accurate and complete reference genome sequence has hampered progress in characterizing the locus in diverse vertebrates including avian ifitms. the genetic structure of the chicken locus was proposed based on the human locus however critical differences suggest that the current chifitm nomenclature might be incorrect  <cit> . indeed, the relative intracellular localizations of chifitm <dig> and  <dig> as defined by genome synteny are the opposite of their human counterpart. this prompted smith at al. to suggest an inversion might have occurred within the locus  <cit> . subsequently, it was shown that duck ifitm <dig> localizes on the plasma membrane, like human ifitm <dig>  highlighting further classification difficulty in avian ifitms  <cit> . in addition, in the effort to explain the conserved antiviral activities of the different human ifitms genes, compton et al. have recently suggested that these differences, which reflect their localization and abundance in a cell, are a sign of a duplication and mutational events of the ifitm genes that arose millions of years  <cit> . although their studies focused in the evolution of the ifitm genes in various non-human primates, it underlines the necessity to consider how avian ifitm genes should be considered as their nomenclature does not reflect necessarily their human orthologues. in this scenario, while ancestral ifitm <dig> is clearly syntenic with hifitm <dig>  more studies are required to elucidate the relationship between the other two ifitm proteins.

the most recent version of the chicken genome  has incorporated long pacbio sequencing reads. this new sequencing has improved the chicken genome, including the ifitm locus. however, when sequencing an entire genome and performing whole genome assembly, minor assembly errors can occur, often due to lack of coverage or because paralogous sequences at other loci compromise accurate assembly. the ifitm gene family is one of the most paralogous families known with multiple copies of both ifitm genes and pseudogenes. for this reason, we sequenced just a small region of chromosome  <dig> containing the ifitm locus at high coverage with pacbio and with illumina miseq.


the average pacbio read length is >10 kb, depending only on the activity of the polymerase  and although pacbio raw reads have a higher error rate compared to other technologies , high quality consensus sequence can be obtained from overlapping reads. to complement the new gallus gallus reference we have focused solely on the chifitm locus and better elucidated its genetic structure by sequencing a bacterial artificial chromosome , from the bac library used to generate the original gallus gallus genome. the 203kb-long bac , containing the chifitm locus, does not include chifitm <dig>  given that the current literature focuses mainly on the antiviral activity of chifitm <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we present evidence of the high confidence, high coverage sequence of this locus and the expression of these  <dig> genes by mapping of publicly-available rna-seq data, to define each of the chifitm proteins at the transcriptional level. further, we describe the design and use of hybrid capture  probes and their use in genome capture and sequencing of other galliform ifitm loci.

RESULTS
de novo assembly of pacbio and miseq sequencing reads
in order to obtain a consensus reference sequence from the raw sequencing data, pacbio reads derived from the bac clone sequencing were quality filtered and de novo assembled with hgap using the protocols available on the smrt portal . summaries of assembly and mapping statistics for pacbio  reads are shown in table  <dig>  because of the length of the pacbio reads, the pacbio de novo assembled consisted of  <dig> assembled fragments . of these, one contig  contained the chicken genome sequence; the others represented genomic sequences from the e.coli bac vector . contig  <dig>  containing chicken sequences, had the highest base coverage and its length suggested it represented the full-length bac clone. therefore, to confirm the identity of this de novo assembled fragment, we utilized act and sequence similarly plots to compare contig  <dig> with chromosome  <dig> reference sequence from both gallus gallus v <dig> and gallus gallus v <dig> . contig  <dig> contained the full chifitm locus and highlights the substantial deficiencies to the gallus gallus v <dig> genome assembly . this contrasts with gallus gallus v <dig> genome assembly where fewer large gaps are observed, but with the presence of a small indel . inspection of the similarity plot shows these differences observed at the nucleotide level fall in the genomic region of the chifitm <dig> gene, within the intronic region . to further analyse this reagion we have also screened the full locus for repeats and low complexity dna sequences as shown in additional file  <dig>  we attempted de novo assembly of illumina miseq paired-end reads using three software packages  resulting in only partial consensus sequence covering between  <dig> and 70% of the full chifitm locus  . the best assembly was generated using iva, which produced the least number of contigs . in order to identify illumina contigs that contained the bac, and specifically the chifitm locus, sequence similarity was used to compare the illumina miseq contigs with the pacbio contig  <dig> . all of the illumina miseq contigs covered either portions of the pacbio contig  <dig>  or just the chifitm locus. these results suggest that while the longer pacbio reads map well to the reference genome , illumina miseq raw reads on their own are not be sufficient to assemble this region de novo, although they do map accurately to the de novo pacbio reference.table  <dig> pacbio and illumina miseq de novo assembly and mapping statistics

to study in more detail the gene order of the v <dig> and v <dig> assembled locus relative to our assembly we used artemis. concentrating on the chifitm genes, we show that combined reads from both sequencing technologies mapped well to v <dig> or v <dig> assemblies, covering the locus to significant depths and aligning to all the regions of interest . the deep and accurate sequence of the chifitm locus allows us to be confident that the chifitm <dig> and  <dig> genes as named and annotated in the v <dig> genome are indeed inverted in comparison to the human locus with chifitm <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes having their transcriptional units in the same direction   <cit> .fig.  <dig> artemis coverage and stack view of illumina miseq reads mapped against pacbio consensus sequence . a overall coverage and gc content of the illumina miseq bac reads  mapped against the pacbio contig  <dig>  this reference was built using the annotation of gallus gallus v <dig> as scaffold. the chifitm genes are located between  <dig> and  <dig> in the 203kb region. b stack view of the illumina miseq reads showing the chifitm locus





sureselect probes design and pull down of the ifitm locus from turkey breast tissue and df <dig> cells
the consensus sequence we have generated was used to design agilent sureselect probes covering the 40 kb region encompassing the ifitm locus. our primary purpose is to use these probes to study possible ifitm variants in different chicken breeds and further into the phylogeny of galliformes. we were able to successfully pull down the ifitm locus in df <dig> cells  as well as turkey breast tissue , showing we are able to use chicken  ifitm probes to pulldown and sequence the locus in a different galliform sub-family, namely the meleagridinae, to which the turkey belongs. the bac clone, like gallus gallus v <dig> of the chicken genome, is from a red jungle fowl, inbred line ucd <dig>  while the df <dig> cells are derived from a white leghorn . mapping of pacbio reads from df <dig> cells against either v <dig> of the chicken genome sequence or our pacbio contig  <dig> gives a good coverage but with low coverage gaps detected in ifitm <dig> and b4galnt <dig> . the ifitm <dig> gap was closable with the low frequency pacbio reads and the pacbio contig  <dig> reference, yielding an accurate ifitm locus sequence for df <dig> cells. illumina sequencing of the turkey ifitm locus assembles more poorly to the turkey reference genome , suggesting the current turkey genome is in need of improvement with long read pacbio sequences as achieved for the chicken genome. we were however, able to identify all four ifitm genes in the turkey locus. we constructed multiple sequence alignments for the two chicken and turkey genome ifitms . amino acid sequence alignment of the ifitm proteins of df <dig>  turkey and gallus gallus v <dig> shows substantial differences as we can see from fig.  <dig>  for the known antiviral ifitms one amino acid change was found between red jungle fowl and white leghorn, namely a63v in the cil domain of ifitm <dig>  more amino acid substitutions were seen for turkey compared to chicken ifitms with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differences between ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. variation in one of the chicken ifitms is maintained in the turkey gene, namely amino acid  <dig> a  or v  and 63 v  in ifitm <dig> fig.  <dig>

mapping rna-seq data to the pacbio contig  <dig> reference containing the chifitm locus
the generation of a high quality de novo assembly of the ifitm locus sequence allows accurate mapping of rna-sequence data from previous published studies for qualitative and quantitative analysis. to validate which chifitm transcripts were expressed, and to assess their level of expression, we first used rna-seq reads from 293 t cells, engineered to express only chicken ifitm proteins constitutively. reads from the control cells  do not map to the chifitm locus . focusing on the 40 kb region containing the chifitm locus, including the flanking genes athl <dig> and b4galnt <dig>  we observed rna-seq reads from 293 t cell lines stably expressing chifitm <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> with expected peaks of expression at gene exon locations . the number of mapped reads and by implication the expression level for chifitm <dig> was higher than that of chifitm <dig> and in turn both higher than that of chifitm <dig> . we analysed  <dig> rna-seq studies totaling  <dig> sequenced chicken tissues and avian cell lines that were identified in the ena database. the samples were examined for constitutive expression levels of the chifitms in a subset of each study covering at least one immune relevant tissue type . to analyze constitutive expression, rna-seq data from liver, spleen, lung and trachea samples taken from the studies as listed in table  <dig>  were mapped against the pacbio contig  <dig>  to these, we added expression data from commonly used laboratory cell lines .table  <dig> chifitm transcripts average coverage values in the stable cell lines


rpkm values were calculated for all the samples present in each study by artemis.  





chifitm <dig> is constitutively expressed  in all tissues and cell lines analysed at levels higher than the putative chifitm <dig> and chifitm <dig>  indeed, putative chifitm <dig> is barely detectable in most of the tissues, and much lower compared to the other ifitm transcripts, as also shown from the rpkm values in table  <dig>  further, when infected or subject to cellular stress chifitm <dig> and chifitm <dig> are abundantly expressed, again with little ifitm <dig> expression. indeed, it is not possible to detect convincing levels of ifitm <dig> expression at any time except for caecal tissue and ileum tissue infected by influenza a h5n <dig> or h5n <dig> . in addition, the coverage graphs confirm that the typical genetic structure of the chifitm genes is maintained, with two exons separated by a single intron in all cases, although reads were observed to map beyond the boundaries of the annotated genes particularly in the stretch of genomic region between ifitm <dig> and  <dig> .fig.  <dig> the read alignment views in artemis showing rna-seq data from the different studies. top panel: the ‘coverage view” showing a separate plot for each bam mapped to our pacbio contig  <dig> . the coverage shows only data relative to constitutive expression level of chifitms in immune-relevant tissues and cell lines . bottom panel: the “stack view”  to show in more detail read depth across each chifitm transcript. all the features were annotated manually blasting the sequences from the latest version of the chicken genome. cyan: cds region, grey: mrna, white: gene

discussion
in this study we have sequenced a bac clone containing the complete chifitm locus using both pacbio and illumina miseq sequencing technologies producing an accurate assembly of the locus. we analysed expression levels of the chifitm genes using publicly available rna-seq data from different chicken lines and tissues, and produced hybrid capture probes for ‘pull-down’ sequencing of another chicken line and the more distant turkey ifitm locus.

the chifitm locus showed several gaps in the version  <dig> of the chicken genome release . it had been improved by sequencing the same dna reference source  with pacbio technology. comparison of the two public versions of the chifitm locus with the one generated in our study  still demonstrated differences, despite being the same inbred line. we believe these discrepancies in the public genome assemblies might be a consequence of genome wide assembly required for full chicken genome, suggesting that our bac sequence  is likely to be more accurate, particularly in gc-rich regions. in addition, quality control analysis and type of assembler used will influence the final consensus sequence generated for any region of the chicken genome, leading to the differences observed in the sequences. to produce our sequence, we employed both pacbio rsii and illumina miseq technologies because they have complementary properties that met our requirements for covering gaps and maintaining sequence integrity. sequencing within gallus gallus domesticus lines, more outbred chickens and more divergent galliforms is now possible using hybrid capture genome sequencing. indeed, we have been able to document many amino acid sequence changes between chickens and turkeys in the antiviral ifitms in regions of the proteins known to be important for their antiviral activity .

the importance of obtaining an accurate sequence is vital to understand the genetic structure and confirm the identity of the ifitm locus, thus to correctly annotate the genes. hypothetical structures of the chifitm locus have been suggested, based on the human locus but inconsistencies remain between alignments for the putative chifitm <dig> and chifitm <dig>  <cit> . based on the literature and current annotation the four genes are clustered on chromosome  <dig> which also contains the chifitm <dig> gene . following the discovery of chifitm <dig>  smith at al.  <cit>  proposed an organizational structure for the locus, based on features such as membrane localization and lack of an n-terminal extension , suggesting that chifitm <dig> is actually analogous to human ifitm <dig>  <cit> . our immunofluorescence analysis to study localization of the chicken proteins expressed in human  stable cell lines is in agreement with smith et al.   <cit> . indeed, chifitm <dig> is membrane-bound, while chifitm <dig> localizes to the early endosomes. here our rna-seq analysis of the ena dataset shows that chifitm <dig> basal expression levels are very low compared to chifitm <dig> and chifitm <dig>  the analysis of the samples in presence of ifnα, h5n <dig>  h5n <dig>  h5n <dig>  ibdv, irf <dig>  alv, lipopolysaccharide or in heat-stress induced conditions, also shows that higher expression levels can be observed for chifitm <dig> and chifitm <dig> suggesting a key role for these two proteins as antiviral ifitms compared to chifitm <dig>  expression of which is only in the intestinal tract and in the testis. although immunofluorescence staining seems to suggest that chifitm <dig> is analogous to hifitm <dig>  the genome organisation supported by long read pacbio sequences now unambiguously confirms that the chifitm <dig> and chifitm <dig> locus is inverted compared to the human locus. we therefore, propose based on gene expression, genome architecture and published functional data the gene order in the chicken locus on chromosome 5q should be renamed: centromeric – b4galnt <dig> – chifitm <dig> – chifitm <dig> – chifitm <dig> – chifitm <dig> – athl <dig> – telomeric.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we have produced an updated genomic map of chifitm locus that includes the two flanking genes athl <dig> and b4galnt <dig>  by combining and analyzing sequencing data derived from pacbio rs ii and illumina miseq sequencing technologies. the only difference detected in our assembled locus sequence relative to the gallus gallus  is a 5 bp insertion in the intronic region of chifitm <dig>  this change in sequence may not have any influence on the function and expression of the chifitm <dig> gene. however, rna-seq analysis shows expression of all ifitms from this locus but that chifitm <dig> has different patterns of expression from the other antiviral ifitms. initial analysis of different chicken breeds shows ifitm amino acid variation between different chicken breeds and turkeys.
