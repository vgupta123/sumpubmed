BACKGROUND
parkinson’s disease  is a progressive, neurodegenerative movement disorder, characterized by the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. although the etiology of pd remains unclear, increasing evidence has shown that oxidative stress plays an important role in its pathogenesis  <cit>  and that of other neurodegenerative disorders. several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of pd, including the production of reactive oxygen species , generated by dopamine auto-oxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, or α-synuclein deposition  <cit> . excessive accumulation of ros, an imbalance of antioxidant enzymes and activation of the oxidase system all damage dna and induce lipid peroxidation and protein modification, subsequently causing cellular dysfunction and even apoptosis  <cit> . pc <dig> cells, derived from a clonal rat pheochromocytoma cell line, have been widely used as cellular models of parkinson’s disease as these cells share features with midbrain dopaminergic neurons  <cit> . the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine , via its active metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion , is selectively taken up by dopaminergic neurons via the plasma membrane dopamine transporter  <cit>  impairing dopamine uptake and eliciting dopaminergic neuronal loss. further understanding into the mechanisms of mpp+-induced dopaminergic neuronal death may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for pd.

the production of ros by mitochondria is thought to be the main cause of oxidative stress. however, a role for the ros-generating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate  oxidase  enzymes has recently emerged. nadph oxidase plays a critical role in cd200-cd200r-mediated dopamine neurotoxicity in pd  <cit> . nox <dig> is a cytochrome subunit of nox that transports electrons across the plasma membrane to generate ros and promotes physiological and pathological processes. studies have shown nox <dig> expression in several areas of the adult brain, including the corpus callosum, spinal cord, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, brainstem, amygdala, striatum, thalamus, cerebellum, etc.  <cit> . activation of phagocytic nox <dig> has been studied mainly in microglia, where it plays a role in inflammation, but may also contribute to neuronal death in pathological conditions  <cit> . thus, microglia-mediated nox <dig> activation, caused by dopaminergic neuron injury, may play a role in the loss of dopaminergic neurons.

heme oxygenase- <dig> , a 32-kda cellular stress response protein , can be rapidly induced by oxidative stress and other noxious stimuli in the brain or other tissues  <cit> . ho- <dig> is the rate-limiting enzyme in heme degradation and is therefore involved in the control of cellular heme content. ho- <dig> has many anti-oxidant properties, giving the enzyme protective properties in various models of oxidative injury. indeed, ho- <dig> over-expressing mice have decreased oxidative damage  <cit> . increased ho- <dig> expression has a cytoprotective effect against mpp+-induced cytotoxicity  <cit> . nrf <dig>  is a transcription factor that induces the expression of various cytoprotective enzymes. nrf <dig> activation and subsequent cytoprotective gene induction promote the restoration of balance between oxidants and antioxidants after an oxidative insult. studies have reported that nrf <dig> can regulate ho- <dig> protein or mrna levels. the coffee diterpene kahweol induces ho- <dig> via the pi3k and p38/nrf <dig> pathways to protect human dopaminergic neurons from 6-hydroxydopamine -induced oxidative stress  <cit> . transfection with nrf <dig> sirna significantly suppressed cigarette smoke particle-phase extract -enhanced ho- <dig> protein levels. activated nrf <dig> is recruited to the promoter region of ho- <dig>  leading to increased expression of ho- <dig> protein in human tracheal smooth muscle cells   <cit> . up-regulation of ho- <dig> by activation of the nrf2-are signaling pathway attenuates paraquat-mediated oxidative stress and cell death in dopaminergic pc <dig> cells  <cit> .

astaxanthin , a carotenoid with antioxidant properties, is 100– <dig> times more effective than vitamin e. atx is commonly found in crustaceans such as shrimp and crab, as well as marine organisms such as salmon, salmon roe, krill and algae. atx is found in the free state and in the ester form and also exists as a chromoprotein. in recent years, a number of in vitro and in vivo studies of atx have demonstrated its antioxidant and neuroprotective effects, for example in global cerebral ischemia in rats  <cit> . in addition, atx has been shown to inhibit 6-ohda-induced neuronal apoptosis  <cit>  and protect pc <dig> cells against beta-amyloid peptide 25–35-induced cell apoptosis and death  <cit> . a study using rats fed natural atx revealed atx crossed the blood–brain barrier in mammals, extending its antioxidant benefits into the brain  <cit> . however, the neuroprotective action of atx in pd has yet to be investigated.

the present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of atx on mpp+-induced oxidative stress in pc <dig> cells.

cell culture
the rat pheochromocytoma cell line  was cultured in high glucose dmem, supplemented with 10% fbs,  <dig> u/ml penicillin, and  <dig> u/ml streptomycin. the cell line was grown as undifferentiated cells in a 100-mm <dig> culture dish at 37°c in a humidified incubator  containing 5% co <dig>  when the cells were 70% confluent they were harvested and dispersed. the well dispersed cells were then cultured for 24– <dig> h with an antagonist or atx in the presence or absence of mpp+. the cultured medium was changed every 2– <dig> d. in some experiments, cells were pre-treated for  <dig> h with  <dig> μm hemin,  <dig> μm snppix,  <dig> μm atx and  <dig> μm dpi, and stimulated with mpp+  for  <dig> h. control cells were cultured without mpp+.

cell viability assay
mtt, absorbed into the cell and eventually the mitochondria, is broken down into formazan by mitochondria succinate dehydrogenase. accumulation of formazan reflects the activity of mitochondria directly and the cell viability indirectly. cell viability was measured by the mtt assay. pc <dig> cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 8× <dig> cells/well, cultured, differentiated, and treated according to the above methods. a total of  <dig> μl of mtt was added at a concentration of  <dig>  mg/ml after media  was added to each well. the plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h to dissolve the formazan that had formed. the solution  was removed from each well and  <dig> μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added. reduced mtt was measured on an elisa reader  at a wavelength of  <dig> nm. values for each treatment group are expressed as a percentage of the control value.

detection of intracellular ros
the dcfh-da assay was used to measure ros production in differentiated pc <dig> cells treated with mpp+. dcfh-da is a fluorescent dye that crosses the cell membrane and is enzymatically hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases to non-fluorescent dcfh. the cells were plated at a density of 4× <dig> cells per 6-well dish. differentiated pc <dig> cells were pretreated with dpi  and atx  in medium for  <dig> h, then exposed to mpp+  for  <dig> h. the cells were incubated with dcfh-da at a final concentration of  <dig> μm in high glucose dmem without fbs for  <dig> min at 37°c and washed three times with dmem. ros levels were measured using a flow cytometer  with excitation and emission wavelengths set at  <dig> and  <dig> nm, respectively. for each analysis,  <dig>  events were recorded. the value for each treatment group was converted to a percentage of the control value.

western blot analysis
the cells, plated at a density of 4× <dig> cells per 6-well dish, were treated with various concentrations of antagonist or atx in media with or without mpp+  for  <dig> h. for whole cell lysates, the cells were washed twice with ice cold pbs, harvested in ripa lysis buffer , incubated for  <dig> min on ice, centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min at 4°c and the supernatant, containing cell lysates, collected. equal amounts of protein  from the cell extracts in each treatment condition were separated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , then transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene fluoride  . the blots were blocked by incubation in 5%  non-fat dry milk in pbs with  <dig> % tween  <dig>  for  <dig> h. after incubation with a primary antibody  in pbs-t at 4°c overnight, the membranes were washed three times in pbs-t for  <dig> min. subsequently, the membranes were incubated for  <dig> h in pbs-t containing the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody . the immunoreactive bands were visualized and quantified using the luminata forte western hrp substrate . protein levels were normalized to the housekeeping protein β-actin  1:1000to adjust for variability of protein loading and expressed as a percentage of the vehicle control.

immunofluorescence confocal microscopy
pc <dig> cells were permeabilized and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  slides were blocked with 1% normal donkey serum  in pbs for  <dig> min at room temperature. cells were washed with  <dig> % bsa /pbs three times with gentle shaking, then incubated with the primary antibodies diluted  in  <dig> % bsa/pbs at 4°c overnight. labeled donkey anti–rabbit igg or anti-mouse igg   were used as the secondary antibody and incubated in the dark for  <dig> h at room temperature. specific antibody binding was detected by alexa fluor 488-  and alexa fluor 594-  conjugated extravidin . confocal microscopy was performed using the leica sp <dig> confocal microscopy system . optical sections were taken at  <dig>  μm intervals and images were captured and stored digitally for analysis. fluorescence intensity was quantified from at least three random fields  per slide, three slides per experimental condition, and repeated three times using separate cell cultures.

quantitative real-time pcr analysis
total rna from pc <dig> cells was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol using trizol reagent . total rna purity and integrity was confirmed using the nd- <dig> nanodrop  and  <dig> bioanalyzer . rna  was reverse-transcribed into cdna in a total volume of  <dig> μl using the revertaidtm first strand cdna synthesis kit . the cdna  was amplified with a sequence detection system  in a total volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> μl of the faststart universal sybr green master mix   and each primer at  <dig>  μm. forward and reverse primers for spe-cific amplification of ho- <dig> , nox <dig>  and β-actin  were designed, eliminating the possibility of amplifying genomic dna. quantitative real-time pcr was performed using the abi prism  <dig> ht sequence detection system  based on the 59-nuclease assay  <cit>  for the various genes indicated and the housekeeping gene gapdh. relative expression was calculated using the ΔΔct method  <cit> , and passed the validation experiment. the results are expressed as an average of triplicate samples of at least three independent experiments for control and treated cells.

statistical analysis
all statistical analyses were carried out using one-way anovas with repeated measures followed by scheffe’s post hoc tests. a p value below  <dig>  was deemed statistically significant.

RESULTS
effects of mpp+, hemin , snppix, dpi and atx on cell viability
to evaluate the viability of differentiated pc <dig> cells after exposure to oxidative injury, differentiated pc <dig> cells were treated with different concentrations of mpp+  for  <dig> h. after washing, and following  <dig> h incubation, cell viability was measured using the mtt assay. mpp+ significantly decreased mtt levels, indicating a lower cell count, in a concentration-dependent manner . treatment with a concentration of 500μΜ of mpp+ for  <dig> h was selected for subsequent experiments as it reduced cell viability to approximately 44% of control . next, the effects of hemin, snppix, dpi and atx on cell viability were investigated. hemin didn’t exhibit any cytotoxic effects on pc <dig> cells at concentrations ranging from 5– <dig> μΜ , while snppix and atx did not significantly alter cell viability at concentrations ranging from  <dig> – <dig> μΜ . for experimental testing, a concentration of  <dig> μΜ for hemin,  <dig> μΜ for snppix and  <dig> μΜ atx were selected. the most commonly used nox inhibitor is dpi. at low concentrations , dpi attenuates the viability of differentiated pc <dig> cells, while at higher concentrations  the effect of dpi on cell viability is more significant . a concentration of  <dig> μΜ, which reduced cell viability by approximately  <dig> % compared with control , was selected to block expression of nox <dig> 

effect of atx on mpp+-induced oxidative stress
the events involved in mpp+-induced oxidative stress were evaluated to determine the amount of intracellular ros production and the effect of atx on ros production. ros production was measured using dcfh-da. as shown in figure  <dig>  the results show mpp+ increased ros production by  <dig> %, which was inhibited by dpi. pretreatment with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm atx caused intracellular ros production in the mpp+ group to decrease by  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. atx alone attenuated ros production by  <dig> %.

effects of hemin, snppix and dpi on mpp+-induced nox <dig>  nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> levels in pc <dig> cells
differentiated pc <dig> cells were pretreated with hemin, snppix and dpi in medium for  <dig> h and exposed to mpp+  for  <dig> h. to determine the relationship between nox <dig> and ho- <dig> expression, pc <dig> cells were treated with control, mpp+ , mpp+  plus hemin , mpp+  plus hemin  and snppix , and mpp+  plus dpi . protein expression of nox <dig>  nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> was determined by western blot analysis. as shown in figure 4a, mpp+ increased nox <dig> expression compared with control . co-treatment with hemin suppressed nox <dig> expression compared with control . co-treatment with hemin and snppix increased nox <dig> expression compared with control . finally, co-treatment with the nadph inhibitor dpi decreased nox <dig> expression compared with the mpp+ treated group . increased nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> expression is shown following mpp+ treatment for  <dig> h compared with control , indicating that mpp+ enhanced nox <dig>  nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> expression in pc <dig> cells. co-treatment with hemin greatly increased ho- <dig> expression compared with control  , finally, although co-treatment with snppix enhanced ho- <dig> expression, the effect was not significant .

to determine whether the relationship between nox <dig> and ho- <dig> expression occurred at the transcriptional level, nox <dig> and ho- <dig> mrna expression was determined using quantitative real-time pcr. our results show that mpp+ treatment up-regulated both nox <dig>  and ho- <dig> mrna  levels. co-treatment with hemin significantly increased ho- <dig> mrna levels by 663% vs. control and 626% vs. the mpp+ group , and decreased nox <dig> mrna levels by  <dig> % vs. the mpp+ group . co-treatment with hemin and snppix decreased ho- <dig> mrna levels by 335% vs. the mpp+ plus hemin group and increased nox <dig> expression by 58% vs. the mpp+ plus hemin group . finally, co-treatment with dpi did not alter nox <dig> mrna levels compared with control . however, dpi treatment decreased nox <dig> mrna levels by 110% compared with the mpp+ group .

we then performed immunofluorescent double staining to examine the subcellular localization and expression of ho- <dig> and nox <dig>  following administration of mpp+ and other reagents . under normal growth conditions, nox <dig> and ho- <dig> were detected in the perinuclear region. mpp+ treatment increased nox <dig> expression, with significant fluorescence extending out toward the peri-phery, which was attenuated by dpi . hemin significantly upregulated ho- <dig> expression, with stronger fluorescence intensity compared with both the control and mpp+ groups, and significantly decreased nox <dig> expression. both hemin-induced effects were attenuated by snppix treatment . the results indicate that mpp+ treatment upregulated nox <dig>  nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> expression at both the mrna and protein levels.

effects of atx on mpp+-induced changes in nox <dig>  nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> levels in pc <dig> cells
previous findings have shown that atx treatment alters the expression of the antioxidant enzyme ho- <dig>  protects neurons against aβ-induced cytotoxicity  <cit> , and protects against oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress-dependent injury  <cit> . we first investigated the possibility that atx might alter the expression of nox <dig>  differentiated pc <dig> cells were pretreated with atx, snppix and dpi in the medium for  <dig> h then exposed to mpp+  for  <dig> h. to determine whether atx enhances ho- <dig> expression and inhibits nox <dig> expression to protect against mpp+-mediated cytotoxicity in pc <dig> cells, cells were treated with control, mpp+ , mpp+  plus atx , mpp+  plus atx  and snppix , mpp+  plus dpi , and atx. as shown in figure 6a, mpp+ increased nox <dig> expression compared with control . co-treatment with atx decreased nox <dig> expression compared with the mpp+ group , while co-treatment with the nadph inhibitor dpi significantly decreased nox <dig> expression compared with the mpp+ group . mpp+  treatment of pc <dig> cells for  <dig> h increased nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> expression compared with control . co-treatment with atx significantly increased both ho- <dig>  and nrf <dig> expression  compared with control . these increases were attenuated by snppix. finally, atx treatment alone did not alter nrf <dig> expression .

to examine whether atx affects nox <dig> and ho- <dig> expression at the transcriptional level, nox <dig> and ho- <dig> mrna expression was determined by quantitative real-time pcr. it revealed that co-treatment with mpp+ and atx significantly increased ho- <dig> mrna levels by 117% vs. the mpp+ group  and decreased nox <dig> mrna levels by  <dig> % vs. the mpp+ group . co-treatment with mpp+, atx and snppix decreased ho- <dig> mrna levels by 121% vs. the mpp+ plus atx group and increased nox <dig> expression by 34% vs. the mpp+ plus atx group . co-treatment with dpi decreased nox <dig> mrna levels compared with the mpp+ group . finally, atx treatment alone decreased nox <dig> and ho- <dig> mrna levels by  <dig> % compared with control .

finally, we analyzed confocal microscopic images of ho- <dig> and nox <dig> subcellular localization and expression after treatment with mpp+ and other reagents . in mpp+-induced pc <dig> cells, mpp+ increased nox <dig> expression with considerable fluorescence extending out from the perinuclear region toward the periphery, which was attenuated by dpi . mpp+ also increased ho- <dig> expression. co-treatment with atx signifi-cantly up-regulated ho- <dig> expression, with considerable fluorescence intensity , which was attenuated by snppix. finally, co-treatment with atx significantly decreased nox <dig> expression .

discussion
there is increasing evidence that oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of pd. the present study was designed to elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms and antioxidant effects of atx, a natural carotenoid found in aquatic animals, in an in vitro model of pd. we tested the protective effects of atx on mpp+-induced cytotoxicity. we found that atx pretreatment significantly reduced oxidative stress in pc <dig> cells treated with mpp+.

nox <dig> plays a key role in microglia-mediated dopaminergic neurotoxicity, such as exposure to rotenone, lps, mptp/mpp+, 6-ohda and angiotensin ii, which induces th-positive selective neuronal death in the midbrain  <cit> . nox2-deficient mice are protected against dopaminergic neurotoxicity in an mptp-induced pd mouse model. dopamine degeneration decreased by 20% in mptp-treated nox2−/− mice compared with the wild-type control group  <cit> . nox <dig> is highly relevant to nervous system diseases, as it regulates the growth, proliferation, activation and apoptosis of neurons, making nox <dig> suppression a promising therapeutic strategy. in our study, mpp+ significantly increased the level of nox <dig> expression, which was subsequently attenuated by dpi . however, dpi is not a specific inhibitor of nox but acts on all flavoproteins.

induction of ho- <dig> inhibits nox activity in macrophages  <cit> , although the mechanism by which ho- <dig> modulates nox activity is not totally clear. the inhibitory effect of ho- <dig> has been observed in both the aorta and kidney, tissues in which nox activation is a major source of oxidative stress  <cit> . hemin decreases cardiac oxidative stress, involving pi3kinase/akt pathway signaling regulation via ho-1/bvr over-expression and modifying nox activation  <cit> . in this study, we provide direct evidence that ho- <dig> modulates nox <dig> activity. hemin, as an ho- <dig> inducer, can increase ho- <dig> and nrf <dig> levels. our study found that hemin significantly decreased nox <dig> activity compared with the mpp+ group; this decrease was subsequently attenuated by snppix treatment . the present study suggests that over-expression of ho- <dig> limits oxidative damage mediated by nox <dig> activation in mpp+-treated pc <dig> cells. this is an important mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of ho- <dig> and nrf <dig>  proposed by several in vitro and in vivo studies. studies have shown that up-regulation of ho- <dig> expression and the subsequent increase in ho activity may confer an adaptive neuroprotective response to oxidative insults both in vitro and in vivo, mediated by the activation of nrf <dig>  <cit> . indeed, in a study using the acute mptp model, it was shown that nrf2−/− mice are more sensitive to mptp  <cit> .

ros have multiple effects on cell function, depending on the amount and subcellular location of the ros generated. controlled intracellular ros production from nox is necessary for normal cellular development and function  <cit> , whereas excessive ros generation is implicated in myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure  <cit> . some studies have reported that ros are involved in the apoptotic mechanism of mpp+-mediated neurotoxicity  <cit> . as mentioned previously, data from this study showed that treatment with mpp+ results in a significant increase in ros, while pretreatment with atx and dpi significantly suppressed ros-generation in pc <dig> cells in a concentration-dependent manner compared with both the control and the mpp+-induced oxidative injury groups . we found that atx exhibited a significant protective effect against mpp+-induced toxicity with no/little toxicity to pc <dig> cells. in addition, atx protected neuronal cells against oxidative damage  <cit> .

findings from a previous study showed that atx induced levels of ho- <dig>  an antioxidant phase ii enzyme, and nrf <dig> in vitro. atx increased the nuclear levels of nrf <dig> and the associated protective enzymes ho- <dig> and nqo- <dig> in rat liver, and it was demonstrated that the protective properties of atx are mediated by the nrf2–are pathway  <cit> . in addition, atx induced ho- <dig> protein expression in sh-sy5y cells, protecting against aβ25–35-mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> . in keeping with these findings, our study showed that atx, a powerful antioxidant, significantly increased nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> protein and mrna expression when cells were exposed to mpp+. in addition, pretreatment with atx significantly suppressed nox <dig> protein and mrna expression compared with the mpp+ group; this suppression was attenuated by snppix treatment . the results indicate that atx increased ho- <dig> and nfr <dig> protein expression and decreased nox <dig> expression, protecting against mpp+-induced cytotoxicity in pc <dig> cells. nox <dig> expression was inhibited by atx and dpi, and over-expression of ho- <dig> decreased nox <dig> expression. we found that nox <dig> levels were increased in pc <dig> cells following mpp+ administration and attenuated by atx pretreatment, which induced ho- <dig> expression. however, when pc <dig> cells were cultured in normal growth conditions, atx did not up-regulate ho- <dig> and nfr <dig> expression. the neuroprotective effects of atx have been reported in several studies using other experimental models  <cit> . moreover, dietary atx has been shown to regulate immune responses, oxidative damage and inflammation in humans  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that atx protects against mpp+-induced oxidative stress via the ho-1/nox <dig> axis in a cell model of pd. our findings suggest that the molecular mechanisms responsible for atx’s neuroprotection are the suppression of ros generation, the induction of ho- <dig> levels and the inhibition of nox <dig> expression. taken together, our data suggest that atx is a viable neuroprotectant and a potential adjuvant therapy for patients with parkinson’s disease.
