BACKGROUND
diabetes is a global health care issue. three hundred-eighty-two million people were reported to have diabetes in  <dig> . additionally, the cost of diabetic foot ulcers to the american health care system was estimated to be $9– <dig> billion in addition to care for diabetes in  <dig>  <cit> . maggot debridement therapy  is a cost-effective, fda-approved treatment for diabetic foot ulcers  <cit> . mdt commonly involves the application of sterile lucilia sericata larvae to a non-healing wound to promote healing and decrease infection. mdt has been applied successfully in more than  <dig> additional medical conditions  <cit> .

mdt promotes healing in part through digestion and mechanical removal of necrotic tissue. debridement is a critical component of effective wound healing  <cit> . enzyme application and mechanical debridement have been studied in clinical trials, but challenges such as expense and potential damage to healthy tissue stunt the large-scale effectiveness of these treatment options  <cit> . in contrast, larvae leave behind healthy tissue. larvae have been shown to ingest fluorescent bacteria in vitro  <cit>  as well as raise the ph of the wound environment via excretions and secretions , which results in inhibition of bacterial growth  <cit> . most of the in vitro studies found that es was more effective at inhibiting growth of gram positive than gram negative bacteria  <cit> . further, in one small vivo study, sterile maggots were found to be more effective at inhibiting growth of gram positive bacteria in infected wounds  <cit> . specific factors and fractions have been identified within es that exhibit antibacterial activity in vitro  <cit> . for example, the insect defensin homologue lucifensin was detected in the gut and salivary glands of l. sericata larvae and identified in wound washings from mdt patients  <cit> . lucifensin exhibited antibacterial activity against a panel of gram positive bacteria  <cit> . some data suggests expression and secretion of antibacterial factors by larvae is not constitutive, but induced by the wound environment . the antibacterial mechanisms of mdt are free from the limitations of antibiotic resistance frequently seen in the clinic. indeed, maggot debridement therapy has been shown to be effective in treatment of mrsa in vitro as well as in clinical case studies  <cit> .

it is clear from these studies that larvae significantly alter the wound environment during mdt. maggot es may also alter the local inflammatory response. for example, l. sericata es modulate neutrophil migration and adhesion and alter expression of pattern recognition receptor levels  <cit> . es also increased the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  while inhibiting secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and il-12p <dig>  <cit> .

in addition to the impact of mdt on the immune response in the wound, mdt also promotes wound healing through formation of granulation tissue  <cit> . this could be a consequence of the physical action of the maggots in the wound, removal of dead tissue, change of wound ph and microbial killing  <cit> . in addition, there is some evidence that maggot es could stimulate growth of human cells in the wound. es was shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation in culture  <cit>  and hepatocyte growth factor  synthesis in 3t <dig> cells  <cit> . further, increased hgf levels were measured in femoral vein blood of patient during mdt  <cit> . however, there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials that mdt shortens wound healing times  <cit> . this may reflect a limitation of the design of the trials  <cit>  but highlights the need for further studies on the promotion of wound healing by maggots.

studies have shown decreased concentrations of growth factors, including several isoforms of platelet-derived growth factor , in chronic wounds when compared to acute wounds  <cit> . this evidence precipitated investigation into topical recombinant growth factor treatment as a means to promote healing in chronic wounds. several growth factors were investigated, however molecular stability limited their success despite the use of gels, micropheres, and other conjugates. nevertheless, after achieving some pre-clinical and clinical success, human pdgf-bb became the first fda-approved recombinant cytokine growth factor  <cit> .

the role of pdgf in wound healing is well established  <cit> . pdgf is a cationic hetero or homo-dimer consisting of a combination of alpha and beta subunit chains containing multiple intra- and inter-chain disulfide bonds. the subunits are produced in a pro form by endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune system cells, and others  <cit> . the pro subunits dimerize in the endoplasmic reticulum into homo or heterodimeric combinations. the pro dimers are further processed via n-terminal modification, remodeling, and cleavage to a mature dimer form  <cit> . the mature dimers are secreted, where they interact with the extra-cellular matrix  and cell surface pdgf receptors. via activation of the pdgf receptor and subsequently pi <dig> kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase , pdgf stimulates cell survival, fibroblast proliferation and chemotaxis, actin reorganization, and production and secretion of other growth factors, ecm constituents, and metalloproteases  <cit> . because of the extensive role of pdgf in wound healing, clinical trials have been done investigating the utility of a topical gel  containing recombinant human pdgf-bb produced in escherichia coli  <cit> . immunostaining of wounds treated with pdgf-bb showed increased fibroblasts, increased collagen fibril formation, and healing   <cit> . in one study, ulcer surface area and time to complete healing were both reduced significantly in patients receiving topical pdgf-bb along with standard wound care, however, the authors purposefully selected large, severe ulcers for inclusion in the study  <cit> . similarly, other trials reported increased healing and/or reduced time to wound closure . however, some trials did not find that topical pdgf treatment significantly improved wound healing . the mixed outcomes could reflect the complexity of the wound healing process that involves mutiple factors, which supports the need for a therapy that combines multiple mechanisms to promote wound healing.

here, we present a novel concept in mdt technology that combines the established benefits of mdt with the potential power of engineered maggots to promote healing. genetically modified larvae engineered to secrete selected human growth factors or antibacterial peptides effective against gram positive and gram negative bacteria could have the potential to synergistically improve wound healing and result in shorter hospital stays. given the low cost of rearing maggots, the technology is likely to be cost-effective compared to dressing gels containing recombinant proteins. the objective of this study is to determine if l. sericata can be engineered to conditionally express and secrete human pdgf-bb. pdgf-bb was selected because pdgf-bb made in e. coli is active and has been approved for use in wound treatment. however, we view this study as proof-of-principle for the future development of engineered l. sericata strains that express a variety of growth factors and antimicrobial peptides.

RESULTS
heat inducible expression of pdgf-b rna in transgenic l. sericata
a heat-inducible system was chosen for pdgf-b expression as it provides several advantages. if fitness costs were observed, flies could be reared in non-permissive conditions in order to obtain sufficient numbers of larvae. subsequently, during clinical application of larvae, the wound temperature would generate the permissive condition and induce pdgf-b expression. we previously showed that the lucilia cuprina hsp <dig>  gene is strongly induced by heat shock in first and third instar larvae  <cit> . further, several putative heat shock factor binding sites were identified within 500 bp upstream of the transcription start site. thus the lchsp <dig> promoter was selected to make the heat inducible pdgf-b gene construct, pb . the lchsp <dig> gene fragment contained 1016 bp upstream of the start of transcription and 180 bp of the 5' utr. the translation start codon was not included in the fragment. a gene fragment encoding the mature active form of pdgf-b gene was synthesized with a codon usage optimal for expression in lucilia. to facilitate secretion from l. sericata larvae, an amino terminal predicted signal peptide was included in the synthesized pdgf-b gene. the signal peptide was identified in a venom peptide that is expressed in l. sericata larval salivary glands  <cit> . for polyadenylation of pdgf-b transcripts, the gene construct contained the 3'utr and 3' flanking dna from a lchsp <dig> gene. the lchsp24-pdgf-b-pa gene construct was inserted into a piggybac transformation vector used previously  <cit>  . the vector contains a zsgreen marker gene under the control of a strong constitutive promoter  for identification of transgenic larvae.fig.  <dig> heat inducible expression of pdgf-b mrna in transgenic pd-1 l. sericata. a schematic of heat-inducible pdgf-b gene construct in a piggybac transformation vector with a zsgreen marker gene. b genomic dna sequence adjacent to the 5' pbac end in the pd- <dig> transgenic line. the ttaa insertion site is underlined. c rt-pcr amplification of pdgf-b on total rna obtained from first instar pd- <dig> larvae that had been given a heat shock  or no heat shock 



l. sericata ca <dig> embryos were injected with pb dna and a piggybac helper dna/rna mixture  <cit> . four transgenic lines were obtained from 18 g <dig> adults that developed from injected embryos. two lines showed the predicted mendelian inheritance for a single transgene . molecular analysis  also indicated that these two lines  carried a single copy of the transgene. however, only the pd <dig> line was homozygous viable and fertile and so this line was selected for further analysis. the nucleotide sequence adjacent to the the transgene was determined by inverse pcr . the transgene had inserted into a ttaa site, which is typical for piggybac-mediated transformation  <cit> .

to determine if pdgf-b mrna expression was inducible by heat shock at 37 °c, rt-pcr was performed on rna isolated from pd- <dig> homozygous first instar larvae. a dna fragment of the correct size was detected from the heat-treated  but not control larvae . this suggests that the pd- <dig> line provides a heat inducible system for pdgf-b expression.

detection of pdgf-bb protein in pd- <dig> larval lysate
we next sought to determine whether or not the human pdgf-bb protein was detectable in lysates of transgenic larvae. a commercial elisa kit was chosen due to its high sensitivity . further, elisa assays detect native protein, while western blots detect linearized protein, allowing detection via antibodies against discontinuous as well as continuous epitopes, thereby further increasing likelihood of detection. for each assay, a positive control his-tagged recombinant human pdgf-bb was included, and yielded a positive signal within the kit standard range . ca <dig> control  and pd- <dig> larvae were subjected to a 3 h at 37 °c heat shock, then snap frozen. lysates were normalized for total protein concentration and each sample was assayed in triplicate elisa wells. pdgf-bb was undetectable in control ca <dig> lysate . while low basal levels of protein were detected in pd- <dig> larval lysate at the control temperature , the pdgf-bb protein concentration increased 5–fold with heat shock treatment . for any future clinical application it is important that the pdgf-bb protein is secreted from lucilia cells and is present in larval es. thus we next heat-shocked larvae in es collection buffer and collected the es. however, pdgf-bb was not detectable in larval secretions . total protein concentration was approximtely 10-fold lower in es samples compared to whole larval lysates. as a result, the amount of total es protein loaded per elisa well was one tenth to one half that of lysates. it is possible that pdgf-bb was present in the es samples but below the level of detection of the assay. we next collected protein from adult hemolymph, reasoning that the protein concentration would be higher than larval es. pdgf-bb was detected in hemolymph isolated from adult pd- <dig> flies after heat shock, albeit at a lower concentration than lysates  these data suggest that the transgenic expression system is functional, and that pdgf-bb is secreted into the hemolymph from cells in which it is expressed.fig.  <dig> pdgf-bb protein is inducible in transgenic pd-1 l. sericata lysate and hemolymph. a mean pdgf-bb concentration in wild type  and pd- <dig> whole larval lysate under control and heat shock conditions. b pdgf-bb concentration in pooled wt or pd- <dig> adult hemolymph samples after heat shock. data from two replicate experiments are shown



pdgf-b rna expression in transgenic l. sericata regulated by the tetracycline transactivator 
the above analysis suggested that higher levels of pdgf-bb expression were needed to produce detectable levels in larval es. we had also previously shown that the “tet-off” system can lead to very high levels of gene expression in transgenic lucilia  <cit> . the tet-off system is comprised of a tta “driver” construct and a tta-responsive “effector” construct . the l. cuprina hsp <dig> promoter is a strong constitutive promoter in transgenic l. sericata  <cit> . indeed, l. sericata larvae expressing dsredex <dig> and zsgreen under the control of this promoter appear light pink and greenish yellow respectively under white light . we reasoned that if the strong hsp <dig> promoter was used to drive tta expression, this would lead to very high levels of the effector, which in this study would be pdgf-b. since the l. cuprina hsp <dig> promoter was used for the marker gene, we isolated the hsp <dig> promoter from a related blowfly, cochliomyia hominivorax . the start of transcription of the chhsp <dig> gene was determined by 5' race, using oligonucleotide primers based on a previously identified transcript  <cit> . the exon-intron arrangement was determined by pcr with genomic dna template and primers based on the transcript. as for the lchsp <dig> gene  <cit> , the chhsp <dig> gene contains one intron with the translation start codon at the beginning of the second exon. a pcr-based genome walking approach was used to obtain the nucleotide sequence of genomic dna upstream from the start of transcription. the dr <dig> driver construct contains a 3 kb fragment from the chhsp <dig> gene upstream of the tta coding region, followed by the sv <dig> polyadenylation sequence. the chhsp <dig> fragment includes 2225 bp of upstream flanking dna, the 200 bp 5' utr and the 586 bp first intron. the tta translation start codon follows the chhsp <dig> intron. the chhsp83-tta gene cassette was cloned in a piggybac transformation vector with a lchsp83-zsgreen marker gene. the ef-pdgf effector construct includes the teto21-lchsp <dig> enhancer-promoter upstream of the pdgf-b coding region and sv <dig> polyadenylation sequence. the teto21-lchsp <dig> enhancer-promoter was used previously to achieve high levels of tta gene expression in l. cuprina   <cit> . the pdgf-b sequence with an n-terminal signal peptide was the same as used above in the heat inducible system. the teto-pdgf-b gene cassette was cloned into a piggybac transformation vector with a lchsp83-dsredex <dig> marker gene.fig.  <dig> tta-mediated pdgf-b expression in transgenic l. sericata. a schematic of the dr <dig> tta driver and ef-pdgf tta-regulated effector gene constructs in piggybac transformation vectors. b genomic dna sequence adjacent to 3' pbac for each strain. c dr4# <dig>  ef-pdgf# <dig>  and dr4#14 + ef-pdgf# <dig> larvae under white light. d relative expression of pdgf-b mrna in control effector alone and tta-driver plus effector larvae. qrt-pcr analysis was performed on rna isolated from whole larvae and normalized to the 28 s rrna reference gene



transgenic dr <dig> and ef-pdgf lines were obtained by piggybac-mediated transformation. for dr <dig>   <dig> lines were initially obtained from 137 g <dig>  however, the lines were weak and difficult to maintain. this is mostly likely because high levels of tta protein are toxic to l. cuprina  <cit> . consequently, only one line, dr4# <dig>  was maintained and this was propagated as a mixture of heterozygotes and homozygotes. dr <dig> had been injected into l. cuprina embryos as part of the effort to make male-only lines  <cit> . for this study, it was necessary to introgress the dr <dig> transgene into a l. sericata genetic background. this was done by crossing l. cuprina dr4# <dig> males with mdla l. sericata females. the offspring were then backcrossed for two generations with l. sericata females. the l. sericata ef-pdgf# <dig> line was obtained from 32 g <dig> and bred to homozygosity. the nucleotide sequence adjacent to the transgene insertion site was determined by inverse pcr .

to induce pdgf-b expression, the dr4# <dig> driver and and ef-pdgf# <dig> effector lines were crossed and the larval offspring collected. in the presence of the antibiotic tetracycline, tta is bound by tetracycline and rendered ineffective. in the absence of tetracycline, however, tta is able to bind to teto in the effector construct and activate pdgf-b expression. third instar larvae of the driver strain express zsgreen marker, and appear yellow green in white light, while third instar larvae of the effector strain express the dsredex <dig> marker and appear light pink. the progeny of this cross with both transgenes appear bright pink . this is most likely because tta bound to teto is also enhancing expression of the linked marker gene from the lchsp <dig> gene promoter. this was previously observed in larvae that overexpress tta  <cit> . to confirm induction of pdgf-b transcript, rna was isolated and quantitative rt-pcr was performed. pdgf-b transcript was readily detected in larvae that contain one copy of each of the dr <dig> and ef-pdgf transgenes. control larvae  had very low levels of pdgf-b mrna expression . in larvae that had both transgenes there was a greater than 4000-fold increase in the level of pdgf-b rna .

pdgf-bb protein detection in whole larval lysate and es from larvae heterozygous for the dr <dig> tta driver and ef-pdgf effector
to determine if the larvae express and secrete pdgf-bb, elisa assays were performed on es samples collected from control ef-pdgf# <dig> larvae and larvae with both the dr <dig> and ef-pdgf transgenes. as with the heat inducible system, pdgf-bb was readily detected in whole larval lysate from larvae with driver and effector . when the more dilute es samples were analyzed, total protein concentration was again much less than for lysates . therefore, the amount of total es protein per elisa well was one tenth to one half that of lysates . however, pdgf-bb was detected in es samples from larvae that have both dr <dig> and ef-pdgf transgenes . mean pdgf-bb concentration in es was more variable between experiments than for whole larval lysates. taken together, these data indicate that human pdgf-b is produced and secreted from third instar l. sericata larvae from a two-component transgene expression system.fig.  <dig> pdgf-bb protein is detectable in larval lysate and es of larvae that carry both tta driver  and tta-regulated pdgf-b  transgenes. a mean pdgf-bb concentration in control effector-alone and tta-driver plus effector larvae. b mean pdgf-bb concentration in effector-alone and tta-driver plus effector larval es



discussion
proteins of human and other origins have been expressed in insect cells in culture for decades  <cit> . more similar to our study, human protein has also been expressed in tissue of insects using transient viral-based  <cit>  and transgenic systems  <cit> . for example, medin and colleagues reported detection of recombinant human adenosine deaminase, a primarily non-secreted protein, in trichoplusia ni larval lysate after injection of a baculovirus-mediated transgene  <cit> . interest in expressing heterologous proteins in insect larvae has arisen from the desire for greater scale-up capabilities than is feasible using cells in culture. a more recent study demonstrated expression of a recombinant mouse anti-botulinum antibody fragment  in trichoplusia ni larvae  <cit> . a secretory signal from bombyx mori was utlilized to facilitate secretion of the protein product from larval cells, however, protein was purified from whole larvae. lastly, secreted human proteins, including growth factors, have been expressed in bombyx mori and purified from hemolymph as well as larval/pupal homogenate, and several of these proteins have proven functional in the veterinary clinic  <cit> . we show here for the first time that the translational and secretory mechanisms of the l. sericata larvae is capable of producing a human growth factor from our transgene expression systems, and that this protein is indeed detectable in hemolymph, larval lysate,and larval secretions. further, we introduce the first human transgene expression in a larval host with potential for human clinical applications.

two conditional systems were employed in this study, one regulated by temperature and the other by addition of tetracycline to the insect diet. the temperature-regulated system was chosen because pdgf-b expression would theoretically increase upon application of the larvae to patient. although pdgf-b expression driven by the lchsp <dig> promoter was heat-inducible in whole larvae, we failed to detect pdgf-bb protein in maggot es. thus this conditional expression system would not be useful for any future clinical application. the d. melanogaster hsp <dig> gene shows tissue-specificity and a cell-specific heat-shock response  <cit> , therefore it’s possible that lchsp <dig> promoter has low activity in lucilia larval tissues that excrete/secrete proteins found in es. nevertheless, our finding that the lchsp <dig> promoter is active and heat inducible could be useful for conditional expression of other proteins in blow flies. further, pdgf-bb was detected in adult hemolymph after heat shock. this suggests that the pre-protein was likely correctly processed and secreted from lucilia cells.

using the two-component tet-off system, we have demonstrated that human pdgf-bb can be expressed in l. sericata larvae and detected in es in an efficient inducible system. with this conditional system, larvae would be raised on diet without tetracycline to induce expression before wound application, thereby maximizing delivery of the secreted factor and healing potential. a strain could be potentially engineered with several different teto-effector genes that would be co-regulated by tta. for example, the effector genes would be other growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor  <cit>  and/or antimicrobial peptides such as lucifensin  <cit>  or cecropin b  <cit> . the es would be active against a broad spectrum of bacterial species as lucifensin is active against gram positive bacteria  <cit>  whereas cecropin b is particularly active against gram negative bacteria  <cit> . in the long term, clinicians might have at their disposal a panel of larvae expressing different factors for each individual wound based on the species of bacteria present in an infection, stage of wound healing, and level of inflammation.

the dr <dig> driver in our system may be further improved. the dr <dig> driver is not the best choice for building strains intended for clinical application, as high levels of tta expression are toxic for lucilia. a tta driver employing a larval salivary gland-specific gene promoter would be advantageous  <cit> , as confining tta expression to one tissue would likely have a lower fitness cost for the insect. further, any effector protein induced by tta would be secreted from the salivary gland. alternatively, since larval excretions contribute to maggot es, tta could be expressed in the gut using a gut-specific promoter. the tet-off system could not be utilized in the clinic if tetracycline or a derivative was being used to treat an infected wound. if this proved to be problematic, the two-component gal4-uas system, widely used in drosophila  <cit> , could be considered for protein expression in lucilia. with this system, it should be possible to achieve similar levels of protein expression as with the tet-off system, however expression would not be conditional. lastly, with the identification of a l. sericata microbiome  <cit> , a paratransgenesis approach  <cit>  of utilizing a bacterial species to express a protein of interest in the gut of l. sericata maggots could be considered.

as with any treatment modality, clinical application of genetically modified l. sericata would require regulatory approval. a potential challenge for the utility of modified mdt is patient attitude toward maggot application. however, several studies indicate that patients will accept mdt  <cit> . indeed, steenvoorde et al., indicate that 89 % of patients surveyed would undergo mdt again and 94 % would recommend it to other patients  <cit> . further, with the availability of polymer biobags or pouches made of nylon or chiffon fabric  <cit> , it may be possible to provide a liquid-permeable barrier when applying sterile genetically modified  maggots to a wound, thereby making the treatment significantly more tolerable for opposing patients. it would also be anticipated that some patients would reject treatment with gm maggots given the public opposition to gm crops  <cit> . however, the gm maggots could be more acceptable, as the use of a fluorescent protein marker should facilitate thorough removal of maggots from a wound after treatment. the larvae could be readily visualized using goggles equipped with the appropriate filter sets  <cit> .

future studies are in order to further characterize the potential clinical utility of our system. treatment of cultured fibroblasts with es samples to measure mapk activation, dna synthesis, proliferation, and motility using an in vitro wound assay would confirm functionality of the secreted protein. further, a rat wound healing model has been created  <cit>  that would provide an excellent pre-clinical model.

CONCLUSIONS
here we show robust, inducible production of human pdgf-b rna and pdgf-bb protein from two conditional expression systems in transgenic l. sericata larvae. with the heat-shock inducible system, pdgf-bb protein was detectable in hemolymph and whole larval lysate but not es. the tta-regulated system is more promising as pdgf-bb protein was detected in larval es in addition to whole larval lysate from larvae raised on diet without tetracycline. potentially, larvae could be engineered with several tta regulated genes such that they secrete/excrete a variety of growth factors and/or antimicrobial factors with the aim of enhancing wound healing, thereby improving patient outcome. the international diabetes federation reports that 80 % of people with diabetes live in low or middle income countries . enhanced mdt may be a cost-effective solution for patients with less access to other treatment modalities.
