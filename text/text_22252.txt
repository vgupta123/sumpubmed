BACKGROUND
human transcriptomes are complicated in three dimensions: diversified to perform tissue/cell-specific functions, undergone temporal regulations during cell cycle and development, and influenced by other physiological and pathological conditions. a collection of genes are expressed in all tissues/cells to maintain basic cellular functions, traditionally known as housekeeping  genes, whereas others are specialized to perform unique functions in differentiated tissues/cells, known as tissue-specific  genes. to characterize cell-specific human transcriptomes, it is important to define this collection of hk genes shared by all human transcriptomes. hk genes were previously considered to express at a constant level across different biological contexts and thus entitled as "control genes" that can be used to standardize quantitative expression studies. however, it has been proven later that the expression of hk genes is still under stringent regulation albeit ubiquitously expressed; their expression levels may vary significantly across different cell types  <cit> . another related concept refers to "essential genes", the disturbances of which often lead to lethal phenotypes. a recent study has demonstrated that about  <dig> genes are essential to sustain bacterial life  <cit> . however, ubiquitous expression does not necessarily mean essentiality and vice versa. in this study, we focused on the primary definition of hk genes — a set of genes universally expressed in diversified tissue/cell types to maintain a basal transcriptome  <cit> .

previous studies have aimed at large-scale categorization of human hk genes, largely based on microarray technology. there have been three lists of hk genes widely cited in the literature. warrington et al.  <cit>  and hsiao et al.  <cit>  pioneered the effort, and obtained  <dig> and  <dig> hk genes after sampling  <dig> and  <dig> tissues, respectively, by using affymetrix hugenefl chip. eisenberg et al.  <cit>  later extended the number of hk genes to  <dig> based on  <dig> tissue samples, using data from a more advanced affymetrix u95a platform  <cit> . depending on these hk gene lists, many following-up studies have demonstrated distinct natures of hk genes in comparison with ts genes, including gene structure  <cit> , nucleotide composition  <cit> , rate of evolution  <cit> , protein domain  <cit> , and other genomic characteristics  <cit> . while comparative analyses between hk and ts genes have produced many meaningful results, a consensus on the identity and number of hk genes has been long expected. although all three microarray-defined hk gene lists arrived at an estimate of about  <dig> in the number of human hk genes, the overlaps among them were very low.

in this study, we used the latest microarray and est data from the public databases to re-categorize hk and ts genes. a manually-curated benchmark of hk genes  was created as control to compare the two different data types. we demonstrated that present est data was far from saturated and many tissues were still poorly sampled. the inadequacy of est sampling limited our ability to identify genes and to understand ts expression. the microarray data, due to a likely over-stringent threshold, showed higher false negative rate in comparison with the est data, leading to a significant underestimation of hk genes. based on est data we catalogued a new set of human hk genes, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in number, nearly a ten-fold increase as compared to the previous results based on microarray data. we believe that this new dataset will be useful for genome-wide analyses on structural and functional features of hk genes.

RESULTS
the limitation of the previous hk gene lists
three lists of microarray-defined hk genes have been widely cited in the literature. after updating the annotation of these datasets, there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hk genes in the lists put together by warrington  <cit> , hsiao  <cit>  and eisenberg  <cit> , respectively. although all of them arrived at an estimate of approximately  <dig> human hk genes, the shared hk genes were found significantly low — only  <dig> genes were found in all three datasets despite the fact that two of them shared  <dig> genes due to the utilization of an identical technical platform . the unique part of individual dataset ranged from 20% to 60%, implying both high false positive  and false negative  rates in these lists. moreover, these studies were based on the old microarray platforms with only approximately  <dig>  genes represented on the chip, less than half of the present annotations. to update these limited results and avoid systematic bias introduced by a single technique, in this study we analyzed both the latest est and microarray data to reassess human hk genes.

gene expression in microarray and est data
we compiled nearly  <dig> million human ests from  <dig>  rna  samples and a recent microarray dataset from gene expression atlas ii  <cit> , where  <dig> rna  samples were hybridized against affymetrix u133a  chip. we analyzed the expression of  <dig>  refseq loci , where  <dig>  were represented on the chip. for comparison, we chose  <dig> well-studied human tissues covered by both data types ; these tissues covered seven major human anatomic systems and should represent a broad spectrum of differentiated tissues/cells in the human body . in est data, we defined a refseq locus as expressed in a given tissue when at least one reliable est  or an est cluster  was detected from that tissue, and in microarray data, the expression was defined by the fluorescent intensity when exceeding a cutoff value of  <dig>  as recommended by the authors who carried out the experiments  <cit>  . at the end, we validated the robustness of the conclusions from  <dig> tissues by extending the analyses to  <dig> tissues that currently have est data .

in est data, we observed that gene detectability in each tissue was proportional to the sampling depth . according to the relationship between the number of detected genes and the number of sampled ests, the sampling was far from saturated for almost all of  <dig> tissues . many tissues were still very poorly sampled, limiting the gene detectability of current est data. in microarray data, the number of detected genes was lower than that in est data, even when ests have not been sampled deeply enough . in our 18-tissue collection,  <dig>  of  <dig>  total genes  were found to be expressed in at least one tissue by est data, in contrast to  <dig>  of  <dig>  represented genes  by microarray data.

we defined expression breadth as the number of unique tissues where a gene was expressed, which ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with decreased tissue-specificity. we observed that the distribution of expression breadth showed two modes representing ts and hk genes respectively in both data types . the degree of tissue specificity varied gradually and no clear-cut boundaries of both ts and hk genes were observed. however, the expression breadth distributions from the two data types showed opposite trend. in microarray data, majority of genes exhibited tissue-specific expression whereas only a small fraction showed universal expression.  <dig>   and  <dig>   genes were detected in only one and all  <dig> tissues, respectively, consistent with previous microarray-based results  <cit> . in est data, a large fraction of genes was found broadly expressed whereas tissue-specific expression was less notable.  <dig>  genes were detected in only one tissue and  <dig>   in all  <dig> tissues. this was in agreement with a recent microarray experiment on  <dig> mouse tissues  <cit> .

we compared the expression breadths of  <dig>  genes detected in at least one of  <dig> tissues by both microarray and est data. the correlation was not significant ; 71% of the genes were detected in less number of tissues by microarray data than by est data. the above observations implied that microarray data on average detected less number of genes compared with est data, thus underestimated the expression breadth, making the expression breadth distribution in microarray data skewed toward ts genes.

benchmarking housekeeping genes
as universal expression is difficult to testify experimentally, a theoretical definition of hk genes based on annotated universal function is rather desirable. in order to build up a control gene set for a comparative analysis of microarray and est data, we manually curated  <dig> genes — a comparable number as previous experimentally-defined hk genes — from large protein complexes or cellular processes that play unquestionable housekeeping roles according to reactome  <cit>  and kegg  <cit>  pathway annotations. this included general transcription factors  <cit>  and major components of capping and polyadenylation machinery  <cit> , spliceosome  <cit> , nuclear rna export complex  <cit> , translation machinery  <cit> , cytosolic ribosome  <cit> , and ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway  <cit>  . we referred this list as hk <dig> and used it as a benchmark for evaluating the degree of imperfection in microarray and est data.

a  <dig> genes with highly proposed housekeeping functions are manually curated from reactome  <cit>  and kegg  <cit> .

b the column ma <dig> and ma <dig> represent the number of these hk genes detected in all  <dig> tissues and at least  <dig> tissues by microarray data, respectively; est <dig> and est <dig> represent that for est data.

in theory, all hk <dig> genes should be detected in all  <dig> tissues if the libraries were sampled adequately. we observed that almost all hk <dig> genes were detected in est data of each tissue with only five exceptions , and the poor detection rate in these tissues was primarily due to poor sampling depth . in contrast, microarray data showed lower detectability compared with est data . comparing each category of hk <dig> genes, we found that transcription pre-initiation complex  failed mostly to be universally detected in both microarray and est data. at best, only  <dig> of  <dig> pic genes were detected in at least  <dig> tissues in est data . this is believed to reflect the fact that transcription factors are on average expressed at a lower level as compared to other protein complexes, such as translation factors, and current est sampling has not been adequate enough to identify them. this result may also agree with our recent understanding that the well-studied tata-dependent transcription initiation only has limited usage in tissue-specific expression, rather than a universal mechanism  <cit> .

we evaluated the expression breadth distribution of hk <dig> genes. in est data, the expression breadths clearly peaked at the value of  <dig> . although only  <dig>  of hk <dig> genes were found expressed in all  <dig> tissues due to  <dig> poorly sampled tissues,  <dig>  were detected in at least  <dig> of  <dig> tissues . this result justified hk <dig> genes as a qualified benchmark. in contrast, microarray data detected only  <dig>  and  <dig>  of hk <dig> genes in all  <dig> tissues and at lest  <dig> of  <dig> tissues, respectively . a messy tail of expression breadth distribution across all breadth groups indicated the rather noisy nature and high fn rate in microarray data .

we studied the detailed expression profiles of all hk <dig> genes in  <dig> tissues and took trna synthetases as a particular case . although this group of enzymes was known to be absolutely universal for all cell types, only  <dig> were ubiquitously detected in microarray data. in contrast, all except one were detected in all  <dig> tissues in est data. this single failure in est data was cars in the most poorly sampled thyroid tissue, and it actually had genuine expression according to microarray data. in general, for the rest of hk <dig> genes, we observed that the failure of detection in est data primarily occurred in poorly sampled tissues but microarray data showed lower and irregular detectability. the detailed expression profiles of hk <dig> genes in est and microarray data were given in additional file  <dig> 

a new catalog of housekeeping genes
as only 70% of hk <dig> genes can be identified by est data in all  <dig> tissues due to several poorly sampled tissues, but 93% of hk <dig> genes have expression breadths enriched at value  <dig> to  <dig> , we set a cutoff at  <dig> tissues for a less stringent definition of hk genes. as a result, we obtained  <dig>  hk genes as a lower bound  and  <dig>  hk genes as an upper bound  according to the est data. similarly, we deduced  <dig>  hk genes  and  <dig>  hk genes  for the low and high numbers according to the microarray data. the detailed descriptions of the  <dig>  est-defined and  <dig>  microarray-defined hk genes were given in additional file  <dig>  we compared  <dig>  est-defined and  <dig>  microarray-defined hk genes, and found  <dig>   and  <dig>  genes unique to each group, respectively . in addition,  <dig>  est-defined hk genes covered nearly all hk genes in the lists of warrington , hsiao  and eisenberg . however, when comparing with  <dig>  microarray-defined hk genes, we found that  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % genes were unique to the warrington's, hsiao's, and eisenberg's lists, respectively ; the consistency among the microarray-derived results was still very low.

tissue-specific expression
we found  <dig>  and  <dig> genes expressed in only one of  <dig> tissues from microarray and est data, respectively. the microarray data identified more ts genes than the est data, but many of which were actually expressed in more than one tissue according to the est data . we observed a common trend in both data: brain and testis contributed the most ts genes as compared to other tissues. in est data, about half of ts genes appeared either brain- or testis-specific. the most important observation we had was that thyroid, the least sampled tissue, had  <dig>  of  <dig>  detected genes  defined as hk genes. this indicated that for poorly sampled tissues our knowledge on their transcriptomes was still limited to the most abundant housekeeping genes, and a true definition of tissue-specific expression required much greater efforts in the future.

false positive and false negative rates
in our analyses, requiring only one est for justifying positive expression was a potential source of fp, but the limited sampling depth of present est data prevented us from using a more stringent threshold. in the least sampled tissue ,  <dig>  of  <dig>   detected genes were sampled only once. if we required >  <dig> est to justify positive expression, these poorly-sampled tissues became non-informative and with very high fn rates. when insisting >  <dig> ests, we had  <dig> tissues suffered severely for the same reason. more seriously, by doing so, the expression breadths of hk genes peaked at the value  <dig> rather than  <dig> — most of hk genes can not be detected in all  <dig> tissues. when the parameter increased to >  <dig> ests, the peak of hk gene expression breadths disappeared — no clear hk gene group existed .

although insisting on single est may introduce fp, there were reasons to suggest that our processed est data should be a reliable indicator for legitimate expression and the fp involved in our est-defined results were very low. first, we only took account of ests that were reliably aligned onto human genome and clustered into refseq loci; most dubious ests originated from genomic contaminations and cloning artefacts during cdna library construction were removed . if we ignore the problems in cloning and rna isolations , est sampling is advantageous in that no empirical cutoff on signals is needed to indicate positive expression. when erroneous sequences are discarded and only reliable sequences are used, est-based methods suffer less from fp than microarray-based ones. second, according to our newly-established transcriptome-sampling model  <cit> , transcripts with certain expression levels have finite probability to be detected at a given sampling stage. although other high-throughput experiments such as sage do introduce erroneous low-frequency tags, for est data at such a poor sampling depth even those genes detected at low sampling frequency are most likely to be moderately and even abundantly expressed.

as among the collection of  <dig>  genes each has concrete evidence of expression detected in all  <dig> tissues, the lower bound of hk genes should be reliable and free of fp. a major source of fp is the expression breadth cutoff value of  <dig> for defining the upper bound of hk genes. the enrichment of expression breadths at  <dig> to  <dig> tissues  suggested that the fp rate of  <dig>  hk genes, if any, should be trivial. another factor related to fp is that we confined the analyses in only  <dig> well-studied tissues covered by both microarray and est data. in order to validate the  <dig>  and  <dig>  hk genes defined by est data in  <dig> tissues, we examined their expression in other tissues presently having est data. current est data covered  <dig> unique human tissues in total but many of them were very poorly sampled . we observed that the expression breadth distribution in  <dig> tissues had two modes representing ts and hk genes as what was seen in the 18-tissue collection. however, due to the limited gene detectability in poorly sampled tissues, the expression breadth of hk genes peaked at value  <dig> and diminished as breadth increased — most of hk genes can only be detected in  <dig> of  <dig> tissues . nevertheless, the expression breadth of hk genes defined in  <dig> tissues did show very broad expression in  <dig> tissues — peaked at about value  <dig> . therefore, the hk gene list defined in  <dig> tissues appears very robust and the fp rate should be low.

the high fn rate of microarray data is attributable to the fact that the cutoff value of  <dig>  <cit>  for defining positive expression is quite conservative. in a parallel analysis, we relaxed the cutoff value to  <dig> and identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes expressed in all  <dig> tissues and at least  <dig> of  <dig> tissues, respectively, where  <dig> % and  <dig> % of hk <dig> genes were covered. these numbers were comparable to those derived from the est data . however, as the cutoff value of  <dig> was determined based on negative controls on the chip to match some optimum ratio of fn to fp, and to our knowledge, almost all published works utilizing this microarray dataset used the cutoff  <dig>  a liberty given to the lower cutoff value for reducing fn should not be encouraged.

discussion
at present time, large-scale gene expression profiling is still approached inadequately; both transcriptome sequencing and microarray technique have their own drawbacks. the most noticeable weakness of microarray technique is that it still suffers from poor detectability and reproducibility for low-copy and transiently-expressed genes  <cit> ; the latter are actually very important as they are most likely enzymes and transcription factors, performing transient yet critical biological functions. systematic noises introduced during sample processing and fluorescence scanning can be improved but are hard to avoid completely, making the cutoff of present/absent call difficult to determine and vary from experiment to experiment. however, est and its equivalent methods suffer the most from low sampling depth although they are essentially capable of discovering novel and low-copy transcripts  <cit> . although about  <dig> million ests have been sequenced, considering the fact that human body has over  <dig> tissue/cell types, many tissues are still poorly sampled. fortunately, short tag techniques and recent developments in multiplex sequencing instruments have been applied to comprehensive transcriptome sampling, allowing for effective acquisition of millions of transcript tags in a single experiment  <cit> .

since mrnas are biological materials of transcriptomes, protocols for rna isolation and processing are critical for transcriptome studies. low-copy transcripts may suffer more severely from rna degradation when lengthy protocols are required, such as making cdna libraries  and labelling rna probes. these factors make both microarray and est profile only approximation of in vivo expression status. in this in silicon study the est data were generated from  <dig>  cdna libraries, and we consolidated tissue samples from similar origin into uniquely defined tissue. although precise information of tissue/cell type, which requires advancement of micro-dissection tools and single-cell techniques, has been lost and potential fp may be introduced, this procedure is a necessary approximation considering the limitation of present expression data.

the last but the most profound issue relates to the extended definition of gene itself. recently, genome-wide tiling array experiments and large-scale full-length cdna sequencing have provided new insights on the transcribed content of human genome  <cit> . transcription is complicated by extensive overlap of transcriptional units as well as alternative initiation, splicing and termination; this complex transcriptional organization challenges the traditional definition of a "gene", suggesting that transcripts should be used as operational units of genomes  <cit> . consequently, the concept of "housekeeping" or "maintenance" should be defined in a hierarchical way related to cell types, growth stages, cell cycles as well as various physiological conditions, and in terms of specific transcript variant.

clearly, we are still at an early stage toward precisely defining the basal and cell-specific transcriptomes. however, we believe that along with the improvement of microarray technology and saturated sequencing of transcriptomes, results from microarray and est data will converge to a consensus. intensive transcriptome sequencing for the identification of unknown transcript, followed by extensive microarray experiments under various biological contexts, will give us a great opportunity to precisely define cell-specific human transcriptome in the near future.

CONCLUSIONS
the present est sampling data was far from adequate; many human tissues were still poorly sampled so that our ability to define ts expression was still very limited. microarray data, due to a likely over-stringent threshold, showed higher fn rate in comparison with est data, leading to a significant underestimation of hk genes. based on est data, we estimated that about  <dig> % of the currently annotated human genes were actually universally expressed, nearly a ten-fold increase as compared to the previous estimates based on microarray data solely.
