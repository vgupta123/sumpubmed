BACKGROUND
anthocyanins, the coloured end product of the flavonoid pathway, play an important role in attracting insects or animals for pollination and seed dispersal. in addition, they play roles as anti-oxidants and in protecting dna and the photosynthetic apparatus from high radiation fluxes  <cit> . other possible functions of anthocyanins, such as the protection against cold stress or providing drought resistance, are likely to be associated with activities restricted to particular classes of plants  <cit> .

the biosynthesis of the flavonoids, a large phenylpropanoid-derived group of phenolic compounds, provides one of the best described plant metabolic pathways, with many of the structural and regulatory genes in the pathway identified and cloned  <cit> . less is known regarding the mechanisms by which the water-soluble anthocyanins are transported from their site of synthesis, the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> , to the vacuole, where they are usually sequestered  <cit> . plant vacuoles are highly dynamic, multifunctional organelles that are the primary storage and turnover sites of macromolecules. these membrane-bound organelles, which can occupy up to 90% of the total cellular volume, are integral part of the endomembrane system, serving as the terminal products of the secretory pathway  <cit> .

several plant species store anthocyanins within vacuolar inclusions that have been loosely termed anthocyanoplasts which have been observed to start as vesicles in the cytoplasm and appear to be membrane bound  <cit> . more recently, the intravacuolar structures observed in the flower petals of various plants, including carnation and lisianthus, were termed anthocyanic vacuolar inclusions, or avis  <cit> . these inclusions were suggested to be membrane-less, proteinaceous matrixes that acted as anthocyanin traps, preferentially for anthocyanidin  <dig>  5-diglycosides  <cit>  or acylated anthocyanins  <cit> . once in the vacuole, many factors influence the in vivo pigmentation provided by anthocyanins, with important consequences for the eco-physiology of plants  <cit> . some of these factors include the particular type of anthocyanidin present , the shape of the cells in which the pigments accumulate  <cit> , the concentration of the pigment, the formation of complexes between anthocyanins and co-pigments  <cit> , and the vacuolar ph <cit> .

environmental conditions are known to induce the accumulation of anthocyanin pigments across the major groups of higher plants, of them light being the best studied  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the anthocyanin pathway is regulated in a circadian fashion, with flavonoid genes peaking at the end of the dark cycle, likely preparing plants for daybreak  <cit> . in maize, members of the pl1/c <dig> r2r <dig> myb and b/r bhlh families of regulatory proteins cooperate for the regulation of anthocyanin pigments  <cit>  and are necessary for the expression of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes c <dig> , chi <dig> , f3h  a <dig> , a <dig> , bz <dig>  and bz <dig>   <cit> . the light-induced expression of members of these r2r <dig> myb and bhlh classes of transcription factors has been proposed to be responsible for the induction of anthocyanins in maize by light  <cit> .

here, we investigated whether light affects the accumulation of maize anthocyanin pigmentation at a level other than through the activation of the known r2r <dig> myb and bhlh regulators of the pathway. towards this goal, we analyzed previously described  <cit>  transgenic black mexican sweet  maize cells in culture expressing the zea mays r and c <dig> regulators from a constitutive, light insensitive camv 35s promoter . we show here that bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells are red, even when grown in complete darkness. upon light treatment, there is a darkening of the color of the bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells, without an appreciable increase in the quantity of anthocyanins or in the type of anthocyanidins present. consistent with these findings, the steady-state levels of several anthocyanin biosynthetic genes does not increase upon light treatment. interestingly, at the subcellular level, light induces an alteration in the way the anthocyanins are distributed within vacuolar compartments. a similar alteration in the morphology of anthocyanin-accumulating vacuoles is observed when maize tassel glumes are irradiated with light, suggesting that the phenomena observed in bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells in culture also occurs in planta. together, our findings suggest a novel mechanism for the action of light on the packaging of anthocyanins in the vacuole and in subvacuolar compartments. this effect of light could only be uncovered after making the biosynthesis of anthocyanins independent of light.

RESULTS
bms cells expressing the transcription factors r and c <dig> accumulate anthocyanins in the dark
to determine whether the light control of the maize anthocyanin pathway is mediated by the expression of the b/r and c1/pl regulators and/or the biosynthetic genes  <cit> , we investigated the pigmentation of bms cells expressing the r and c <dig> genes from the constitutive camv 35s promoter   <cit> . bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells grown in complete darkness for  <dig> days were fully pigmented with anthocyanins . the bombardment of bms cells with the r and c <dig> regulators driven from the 35s promoter  resulted in the accumulation of red cells within  <dig> hours, even when cells were kept in complete darkness after bombardment . these results indicate that the constitutive expression of the r and c <dig> regulators is sufficient for the activation of the pathway, even in the absence of light.

bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells darken in the light
to investigate whether light has any additional effect on the pigmentation present in bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells, we compared the color of bms and bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells grown for six days in complete darkness or under light conditions . bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells grown in the light showed a visual darkening, when compared to cells grown in the dark . however, light did not induce any visible difference in the white-yellow color of the control bms cells not expressing the c <dig> and r regulators . we quantified these visual color differences in vivo using a reflectometer and the cielab color space value system. l* values, representing the lightness level, were reproducibly not affected by light . the a* values for bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells were positive , consistent with the red color characteristic of these cells. there was however a significant  reduction in the a-values when the bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells were exposed to light, which was observed in each of the three times that the experiment was performed . although the b* values, contributing to yellow  or blue , were significantly different  between the dark and light grown bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells, they hovered near the zero value, suggesting a low contribution to the overall observed color shift. thus, the a* and the b* values observed corresponded to a quantifiably red color , with a decreased degree of redness in the light, which is in agreement with our visual observations . in the absence of a change in the l* value, the apparent darkening of the cells is likely caused by the spectral shift of the reflected light towards the less red.

the anthocyanin contents or mrna steady state levels of biosynthetic genes are not altered by white light in bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells
to investigate whether the change in color observed between dark- and light grown bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells is due to an alteration in the quality or quantity of the pigments, anthocyanins were extracted and quantified. methanolic extracts of the cells, normalized for dry weight, were analyzed spectrophotometrically. the absorption spectra of pigments obtained from acidic methanol extracts of dark- and light-treated cells showed identical profiles and very similar absorbance values at  <dig> nm . to determine whether light induced an alteration in the type of anthocyanidin present, total anthocyanidins were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography . similar levels of cyanidin and pelargonidin are present in light- and dark treated bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells , consistent with the two major types of anthocyanidins previously described in bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells  <cit> .

in bms cells, r and c <dig> are known to activate several flavonoid biosynthetic genes  <cit> . to investigate whether the activation of these genes was further enhanced by the light treatment, total rna was extracted from bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells incubated for six days in the light or the dark and analyzed by rna gel blots . no significant alteration in the steady-state mrna levels for chalcone synthase , flavanone 3-hydroxylase  or dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  was observed for the light grown bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells. the control bms cells showed no mrna accumulation for these genes . together, these results suggest that the darkening of the bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells upon light treatment is not due to an alteration in the quantity or quality of the anthocyanin pigments present.

white light induces alterations in the sub-cellular distribution and vacuolar organization of anthocyanins in bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells
alterations in rose flower pigmentation were associated previously with the formation of avi-like structures  <cit> . to investigate whether a similar alteration in the packing of anthocyanins could be with the light-induced hue alteration of bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells, we investigated the sub-cellular morphology of dark- and light-treated bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells. to unequivocally visualize the vacuole, bms and bms35s::r+35::c <dig> were stained with the cell permeable, acetoxymethyl derivative of the fluorescent vacuolar dye, 2',7'-bis-5-carboxyfluorescein . in the control bms cells, there are typically one to a few large vacuolar compartments . in contrast, bms35s::r+35::c <dig> cells are always multi-vacuolated . unfortunately, anthocyanins concentrated in the vacuolar inclusions quench the fluorescence of the bcecf-am dye, as observed in some of the larger vacuoles .

within the vacuole, anthocyanins accumulate in inclusions that, when observed under polarized light, appear round and regular in shape or aggregated, like an intertwine of fine strings with blebs . the number of vacuoles and inclusions per vacuole are dramatically affected by light in bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells. in dark-treated bms35s::r+35::c <dig> cells, the major representative cell type , had a range of  <dig> to  <dig> observable vacuoles . in these cells, the anthocyanins were present mainly in the rounded vacuolar inclusions with a characteristic pale pink coloration of the vacuolar sap, a phenomenon called here "anthocyanin spread". the next two most abundant cell types present in dark-treated bms35s::r+35::c <dig> cells, corresponding to 16% and 11% of all the cells, had a range of 10– <dig> or 20– <dig> visually observable vacuoles per cell, respectively . cells of these groups are characterized by no observable anthocyanin spread in the vacuolar sap under the light microscope, yet had red or pale red anthocyanin inclusions in the vacuole .

in the light, the majority of the bms35s::r+35::c <dig> cells  show one to ten pigmented vacuoles with red inclusions that appeared most of time diffuse and like "tangled strings" . these structures were determined to be  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm in diameter, appeared in certain cells to be branched with bleb-like structures at their ends. a significant population of cells  had 10– <dig> vacuoles, lightly colored with discrete deeply pigmented, spherical inclusions . the third most abundant class of bms35s::r+35::c <dig> cells present in the light  showed deeply pigmented vacuoles and enlarged inclusions .

comparison of the size of the vacuolar inclusions in the dark- and light-grown bms35s::r+35::c <dig> cells  shows that the majority of the inclusions in the dark grown samples are in the size range of  <dig>  μm – l μm, with a noticeable absence of larger ones. the modal range of the vacuolar inclusions in light grown cells was  <dig> μm –  <dig> μm, with some as large as  <dig> μm. this may reflect the fusion of smaller vacuolar inclusions to give rise to larger ones . the control bms cells, grown in the dark or light, did not show any evident sub-cellular morphological changes .

to further understand the changes induced by light in anthocyanin-accumulating cells, we performed laser scanning confocal microscopy of bcecf-am loaded bms35s::r+35::c <dig> cells. dark-grown cells showed the presence of multiple vacuoles , which, upon light treatment, appeared to coalesce to form fewer, much larger vacuoles . light-grown cells display a decrease in fluorescence, likely because of quenching by the anthocyanins released from the vacuolar inclusions. dark- or light-grown bms cells showed no distinctive differences in visual fluorescence intensity or vacuolar morphology , suggesting that the observed morphological alterations are either a consequence of the expression of the r and c <dig> regulators, of the accumulation of anthocyanins or of distinctive properties of the vacuoles in which anthocyanins accumulate.

together, these results show that light-exposed bms35s::r+35::c <dig> cells have a significant reduction in the number of vacuoles with a associated increase in their size, a change in the number, shape and size of the avis and a release of anthocyanins from the avis into the vacuole.

light-induced vacuolar morphological alterations in anthocyanin-accumulating maize floral organs
to establish whether the light-induced vacuolar alterations observed in bms cells could be observed also in planta, we looked at the tassels of maize b-i pl plants that accumulated large quantities of anthocyanins . the inner, light-protected lemma and palea  were the choice of material to observe the light-induced alterations in vacuolar morphology. the epidermal cells of these appendages in a c2-idf mutant lacking anthocyanins  have one to a few large, observable, colorless, central vacuoles . in contrast, depending on the physiological and developmental stage of the florets, the epidermal cells of the lemma or palea of the b-i pl florets  were either already filled with anthocyanins, or were in the initial stages of accumulation . these cells show a distinctive multi-vacuolar morphology, and the vacuoles were often heavily loaded with anthocyanins and avi-like structures .

light from the microscope was sufficient to induce dramatic alterations in the morphology and distribution of the anthocyanin-containing vacuolar structures, as seen in the time-lapse images taken at four-second intervals . in these series, the initially thin, tubular anthocyanin-filled structures  expand to a thickness of about  <dig>  μm, dynamically filling the entire cell . these thick, finger-like projections became swollen, sheet-like structures , to then become rounded  and fuse with each other. these rounded/oval compartments measuring one 1– <dig> μm in diameter displayed, just like the tubular structures, dynamic morphological changes. swollen "blebs" were observed moving along fine tubules and the ends of the thick tubules swelled up into round structures. fusion events, once initiated, were very rapid, which resulted in the formation of large fusion bodies  containing numerous clear  structures . these clear inclusions were also observed initially in the sheet-like structures and were formed as the size of the tubules grew. the fusion bodies progressed rapidly to fill the entire cell, finally coalescing together resulting in the anthocyanin spread throughout the compartment . the defined margins around the large central avi-like structure  become more diffuse with a lighter translucent red halo around the opaque, dark body .

in contrast to the bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells, in which anthocyanin production was uncoupled from the light-induced morphological alterations, the accumulation of anthocyanins in these b-i pl cells is light induced  <cit> . thus, the observed alterations in vacuolar morphology could be a consequence of the light-induced expression of the transcription factors, of the light-induced accumulation of anthocyanin, of light-induced alterations in vacuolar morphology observed in bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells, or a combination of them.

discussion
anthocyanin pigments play many important eco-physiological roles in plants. while the biosynthesis and regulation of anthocyanins has been extensively described, little is known on how these pigments are sequestered in the vacuole and to what extent their modes of storage affect color. we describe here cytological changes of vacuoles and sub-vacuolar compartments containing anthocyanins in maize cells exposed to light.

our studies in bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells show anthocyanins to accumulate even in total darkness, without any effect of light on the levels of anthocyanins nor on the amount of transcripts of the various flavonoid biosynthetic genes. from these results, we conclude that, when the r and c <dig> regulators are expressed, there is no need for additional light-induced factors to influence the control of the pathway. this provides strong support to previous findings suggesting that the flavonoid pathway is regulated by light at the level of transcription of the known r2r <dig> myb and/or bhlh transcriptional activators and not at the level of the pathway structural genes  <cit> . thus, the bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells provide a powerful tool to uncouple the effect of light on anthocyanin accumulation and pigmentation, something not feasible in most plant systems, where anthocyanins are induced by light.

the similar levels of anthocyanins in the bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells under dark or light conditions allowed us to uncover a second effect of light on pigmentation. light-treated bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells were darker in color, when compared to identical cells grown in the dark . significant quantifiable reflectance differences are observed between bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells grown for six days in continuous light or dark , changes that are not associated with a variation in the amount or type of anthocyanins present . microscopy studies established that extensive vacuolar morphological alterations  correlate with the color darkening. bms cells not expressing the anthocyanin regulators usually have one or a few vacuolar compartments . in contrast, constitutive expression of r and c <dig> in these cells results in a remarkable increase in vacuolar number. it remains to be established whether the accumulation of flavonoids/anthocyanins, the expression of the regulators, or both are necessary and sufficient to trigger the biogenesis of new vacuolar compartments. within the vacuoles, anthocyanins accumulate in maize cells in red spherical bodies that resemble vacuolar anthocyanoplasts  <cit> . although we have not yet unequivocally established whether the anthocyanin inclusions present in bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells are membrane-bound or not, they have very similar characteristics to the recently-described yellow auto-fluorescent bodies  present in the vacuoles of bms cells, induced by the expression of the p <dig> regulator of 3-deoxy flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> .

the organization of the anthocyanin inclusions present in bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells undergo dramatic modifications in the presence of light. these alterations include a reduction in their numbers and an enlargement of their size . in addition, light-treated vacuoles often showed a spreading of the anthocyanin pigment within the vacuolar lumen, which may be a result of release from the avi-like structures. the morphological changes observed in the vacuoles of bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells are not a "curiosity" of cells in culture. we uncovered similar light-induced alterations in the vacuolar structure of maize floral tissues accumulating high levels of anthocyanins . time-lapse experiments  illustrate the formation and fusions of tubular and globular anthocyanin-filled structures that ultimately coalesce to give one or a few large central vacuoles characteristic of pigmented maize cells. these tubular-vesicular structures, some of which are filled with clear vesicles, are reminiscent of observations of the tubular provacuoles found in vacuolating euphorbia root cells  <cit> . the anatomical identity of these structures remains to be established, but similar to what was reported for the euphorbia root cells, the ontogenesis of larger anthocyanin-containing vacuoles from smaller ones is reminiscent of vacuolar fusion and/or autophagy.

it is possible that these light-induced morphological alterations in the anthocyanin-containing structures are directly associated, if not responsible, for the observed color changes. however, alterations in vacuolar ph or the association of anthocyanins with co-pigments can also result in changes in the hue of anthocyanin pigmentation  <cit> . to investigate whether light induces a change in the vacuolar ph of bms cells, we utilized the bcecf-am fluorescent dye, for which the ratio of fluorescence emission at the dual excitation wavelengths of  <dig> nm/ <dig> nm can be calibrated to an in vivo generated ph curve  <cit> . using this method, we established that the vacuoles of dark and light grown bms cells were acidic at ph  <dig>  and showed no significant ph differences . similarly, ph measurement of crude homogenates of bms or bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells in water did not yield significant ph value differences between each other or between light- and dark-grown cells . although unlikely, based on the absence of a shift of the λmax of the pigments , we also investigated whether light participated in the induction of phytochemicals that could serve as co-pigments, and hence contribute to the color change. reverse phase hplc analyses exhibited no significant differences in the peak profiles of phenolic compounds in the dark and light grown bms and bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells .

although these results do not rule out the possibility of a local and/or transient light-induced ph change or the induction of a minor co-pigment responsible for the color shift, one possible explanation is that the alterations in vacuolar morphology are the cause for the light induced darkening phenomenon of the anthocyanin containing cells. similar light-induced effects were previously described for the anthocyanoplasts of red cabbage, an observation that was attributed to an increased accumulation of anthocyanins enhanced by light  <cit> . our results, however, offer the alternative explanation that light itself can affect the packaging and distribution of anthocyanins within the vacuole, independently of variations in the levels of anthocyanins. similarly, flowers of the "rhapsody in blue" rose cultivar show a change in color induced by age, from red-purple to bluish-purple, and this variation was associated with a progressive accumulation of anthocyanins into avi-like structures  <cit> . lisianthus flowers also show a correlation between the packaging of anthocyanins into avis, the presence of "blackish-purple" pigmentation at the base of the petal, and the reduction or absence of avis in the outer zones, associated with a lighter purple color of this region  <cit> . it is thus possible that the observed alteration in the hue of light-grown bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells reflects a much more general mechanism of light on the packaging of anthocyanins within the vacuole, and hence on pigmentation. if so, the bms35s::r+35s::c <dig> cells provide a convenient system for the dissection of the mechanisms of this process because of the molecular and cellular tools available.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here provide evidence that light affects anthocyanin pigmentation by mechanisms beyond the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding pathway enzymes. in maize floral organs and cultured cells, light induces dramatic morphological alterations in the packing of anthocyanins and distribution of vacuolar and sub-vacuolar compartments. similar phenomena have been observed before, but the difficulties associated in uncoupling anthocyanin production with morphological alterations in their packaging prevented to draw conclusive cause-consequence relationships.
