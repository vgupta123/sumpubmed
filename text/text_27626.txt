BACKGROUND
pneumocystis carinii is a fungal microbe that is found in the lungs of laboratory rats  <cit> . p. carinii appears to be specific to rats because it is not found in other species of mammals and fails to establish itself when introduced into immunodeficient mice  <cit> , which have their own species of pneumocystis, called p. murina  <cit> . p. carinii is morphologically and phylogenetically closely related to p. murina, both of which are somewhat less closely related to the human pathogen, pneumocystis jirovecii, which causes pneumocystis pneumonia in individuals with impaired immune function, such as patients suffering from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome   <cit> . p. carinii and p. murina can cause pneumonia in their hosts, rats and mice, respectively, if these host animals lack a robust immune system  <cit> .

while p. carinii can cause disease in the absence of a normal immune system, rats that lack such a system are probably not its normal ecological niche. it has been established that p. carinii organisms can persist for months in rats that are immunologically normal  <cit> . normal laboratory rats are often colonized by p. carinii and show no obvious ill effects  <cit> . likewise, p. murina appears to be able to inhabit normal mice  <cit> . by analogy, p. jirovecii would be expected to make its home in normal humans, and data showing colonization of healthy people by p. jirovecii are accumulating  <cit> .

none of the species of pneumocystis that have been studied have been observed to proliferate much outside of the airway of the mammalian host in which they are found, and pneumocystis dna is very scarce in environments apart from mammals  <cit> . thus, pneumocystis species exhibit three features suggesting that they are obligate parasites of mammals: 1) they are extremely scarce outside of the mammalian lung. 2) they have fastidious growth requirements. 3) they can colonize immunocompetent hosts.

parasites employ various methods to survive in the face of host defenses. one such method is programmed antigenic variation, which allows a population of parasites to quickly produce an organism whose surface differs from that of the others in the population. the vsg antigenic variation system in the protozoan parasite trypanosoma brucei illustrates how gene families can be used to create phenotypic diversity within a population of eukaryotic parasites  <cit> . there are thousands of different vsg genes in the t. brucei genome  <cit> . these genes tend to be clustered together near telomeres. only one vsg gene is transcribed in a given cell. the gene that is expressed changes frequently enough to make it probable that the host immune response, which is directed against the version of vsg present on the majority of parasites, does not destroy all of the parasites in the host. changing which gene is expressed in t. brucei is often accomplished via dna recombination, which alters an expressed vsg gene by replacing some or all of its dna with dna from a silent vsg gene  <cit> .

the p. carinii msg  gene family is much smaller than the t. brucei vsg gene family, but exhibits structural and functional features similar to it. the p. carinii genome contains approximately  <dig> msg genes, which are located at the ends of each of  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> . pairwise comparisons of eleven complete p. carinii msg showed that they are between  <dig> and 19% divergent, but share a number of features including a length of approximately  <dig> kb, a lack of introns and the presence of an invariant 5' sequence element called the crje, which is discussed further below  <cit> . other short invariant sequence elements reside at multiple locations within the bodies of the  <dig> fully sequenced msg genes, which tended to be least variable at their 3' ends. most of the  <dig> genes have been shown to be members of gene clusters containing up to  <dig> msg genes. the genes within a cluster were as different from one another as they were from genes in different clusters, suggesting that selection and or recombination has driven rapid diversification of p. carinii msg genes  <cit> .

msg genes have been described in five other species of pneumocystis, including the three that have received a species name other than " carinii", p. murina   <cit> , p. wakefieldiae   <cit>  and p. jirovecii   <cit> . msg sequences have also been reported from two additional presumptive pneumocystis species  that do not yet have their own species name  <cit> .

studies on restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism have shown that there is considerable variation in the msg gene families present in p. jirovecii organisms found in different human beings  <cit> . these finding are consistent with the idea that msg genes evolve rapidly. compared to p. jirovecii msg genes, neither p. carinii nor p. murina msg genes families exhibited much variation when studied by restriction enzyme analysis  <cit> . nevertheless, it is possible that msg gene families are evolving relatively quickly in each species of pneumocystis, and that the more limited msg diversity seen in p. carinii and p. murina reflects the isolation of laboratory rodents, a practice that would be expected to limit exposure to the populations of pneumocystis that live in wild rodents. while keeping rodents in vivaria keeps exogenous microbes out, it would also tend to trap any endogenous parasites. it is common to find p. carinii at low levels in laboratory rats that have not been deliberately exposed to the fungus, indicating that a particular population of p. carinii can propagate within colonies of laboratory rats  <cit> . therefore, the reason that p. carinii found in laboratory rats tend to be relatively genetically uniform may be that these microbes descended from those that were captured along with the rats that were used to establish laboratory colonies. by contrast, human beings would be expected to encounter multiple wild strains of p. jirovecii.

expression of msg gene families has been studied primarily in p. carinii, where several lines of evidence indicate that a single msg gene is transcribed in a given p. carinii genome at a given time. restricted transcription is accomplished via a cis-dependent mechanism that involves a unique telomeric site in the genome called the expression site. only the msg gene adjacent to the expression site is represented by messenger rna  <cit> . the msg protein on the surface of p. carinii organisms has been shown to vary and to be encoded by the msg gene that is at the expression site  <cit> . the expression site contains the ucs , a sequence found at the beginning of messenger rnas encoding diverse msg proteins  <cit>  . immediately adjacent to and downstream of the ucs, there is short sequence, called the crje, which is conserved among all msg genes, by definition  <cit> .

crje stands for "conserved recombination junction element" because it could be involved in recombination events that cause the msg gene at the expression site to change  <cit> . the crje is present both at the expression site at the junction between the ucs and the expressed msg gene, and in msg genes that were not attached to the expression site  . the location and conservation of the crje suggests that it could function as a target of a site-specific event, such as a double-stranded break, which would be expected to increase recombination between the expression site and a donor msg gene. however, there is no direct evidence for such events and the role of the crje in recombination is still a matter of speculation. nevertheless, the crje serves to identify msg genes, which otherwise resemble msr genes, a p. carinii gene family that is not regulated by the msg expression site  <cit> .

a large variety of different msg sequences have been observed at the expression site, indicating that recombination can install dna from various silent donor msg genes at this locus  <cit> . the types and frequencies of the inferred recombination events are not clear because the fastidiousness of p. carinii has prevented experiments in vitro, and experiments in rats are complicated by their tendency to be colonized by p. carinii, which has limited the utility of experiments that seek to observe phenotypic or genotypic switching by introducing into a rat a small population of p. carinii expressing a known msg gene  <cit> . an alternative approach to understanding the msg system would be to acquire a better understanding of the gene family. if all of the genes in the family are identified, it may be possible to infer how changes are produced at the expression site. for example, if recombination completely replaces the msg gene at the expression site with an msg gene from a donor site, then the sequences found at the expression site will match those in the donor gene database. however, if recombination were to alter a segment of the msg gene that is at the expression site, then there will be sequences linked to the ucs that do not exactly match any of the donor genes.

understanding the msg gene family at the sequence level will also aid in assessing the function of this family. if its function is to confer variability, then msg genes will have evolved under the influence of selection for variation in the proteins they encode , a prediction that can be tested by sequence analysis.

sequence data pertaining to the p. carinii msg gene family are available, but the vast majority of the available data has not been analyzed  <cit> . analysis of these data is challenging for several reasons. first, most of the data are in the form of shotgun reads which require assembly. however, standard assembly procedures are not designed to assemble genes from gene families, and might join reads that came from different genes. a second possible complication stems from the doubtful clonality of p. carinii populations. the organisms used to obtain genome sequence data came from the lungs of immunosuppressed rats that had been infected by constant exposure to other infected rats  <cit> . this system of obtaining infected rats has been in operation for decades. hence, more than one genetic strain of p. carinii could have contributed to the dna used to obtain genomic sequences, and a given msg gene could be represented by more than one allele. alleles are defined as different versions of the sequence located at a particular location on a chromosome . in absence of gene flow between two populations that were genetically identical at separation, mutation will cause allelic polymorphism to arise over time. the formation of allelic polymorphism would be accelerated if selection were to favor cells that sustained mutation, as could be the case for msg genes given their probable role in generating phenotypic variation. p. carinii cells are thought to be haploid, and a given haploid cell can contain only one allele at each locus. nevertheless, two strains might contain two different alleles of a particular gene at a particular locus. therefore, if more than one genetic strain of p. carinii contributed to the sequence data, then a given msg gene could be represented by more than one allele. assembly programs would tend to amalgamate alleles into a single consensus sequence, thereby obscuring an important aspect of the sequence data.

a third problem is posed by the presence of msr genes in the p. carinii genome. msr and msg genes are distinct, but highly related, and analysis of sequence data must be performed in a way that avoids sequence reads from msr genes.

in the studies described herein, the first  <dig> basepairs of msg genes were selected for analysis. although msg genes are more than  <dig> basepairs long, analyzing the first  <dig> bps of msg genes offered two important practical advantages. first, this segment of an msg gene is specifically amplifiable using the crje as a primer-binding site . hence, this approach avoids interference from msr genes, which lack the crje. second, the  <dig> bp amplicons are smaller than the average sequence read available in the largest database, that of the pneumocystis genome project. therefore, it seemed probable that sequence reads spanning the entire  <dig> bps would be numerous in the database, in which case it would be possible to cover the whole family without having to rely on assembly of contigs, which is problematic when dealing with gene families. practical advantages aside, the 5-prime ends of msg genes are of interest because recombination events that move dna from donor genes to the gene at the expression site may be frequent in this region. defining the full repertoire of donor msg genes should allow this hypothesis to be tested in the future.

RESULTS
strategy and approach for sequence analysis of the msg gene family
assembly of short sequence reads from a gene family can be problematic because assembly relies on sequence identity, and members of gene families tend to share bits of sequence identity. therefore, the assembler might join sequences that represent different members of the family. while mis-joining can be minimized by increasing the number of consecutive bases that must match, doing so reduces the number of useful sequences and raises the risk of failure to join sequences that represent the same gene, but are slightly different due to errors or allelic variation. although the p. carinii genome appears to be haploid, a given gene could be represented by more than one allele because stocks of p. carinii available for sequence analysis may have included a variety of genetic strains. in the case of p. carinii msg genes, analysis is further complicated by two other factors. first, the p. carinii genome contains a second gene family, msr, members of which are very similar to members of the msg gene family  <cit> . second, rats can be co-infected by a second species of pneumocystis, p. wakefieldiae  <cit> . in light of these considerations, the first  <dig> nucleotides from msg genes were chosen for analysis. this segment can be amplified and sequenced as a single unit that contains the crje, a sequence element that distinguishes msg genes from msr genes, and distinguishes p. carinii msg genes from p. wakefieldiae msg genes  <cit> .

the strategy for acquisition and analysis of sequence data is summarized in figure  <dig>  all of the sequences acquired via this strategy began with a copy of the crje and ended with a conserved sequence called c <dig>  <cit> . therefore, all of the sequences overlapped by at least  <dig> bases.

comparison of all sequence reads
combining the sequence reads found in the genome project database with the sequences obtained from adam plasmid libraries provided  <dig> sequences, which was more than  <dig> times as many as the  <dig> genes thought to be in the p. carinii msg gene family  <cit> . some sequences were present dozens of times among the  <dig>  while other sequences were present only once. variation in the number of times a sequence was present occurred both in data from the adam plasmids and in reads from the genome project.

there were  <dig> different sequences among the set of  <dig>  pairwise comparisons of the  <dig> non-identical sequences showed that the average number of non-identical sites between any two sequences was  <dig> ±  <dig> , a value similar to that observed when  <dig> full-length msg genes were compared  <cit>  . the difference-values were distributed around the mean in a manner that resembled a normal distribution, with approximately 95% of the data falling between 10% and 30%, which was within  <dig> standard deviations of the mean. however, pairs of sequences that differed by less than 10% were apparent in the distribution, indicating that some sequence reads were very similar to others.

estimation of error in sequence reads
to assess error in the sequence data, sequence reads that were at least 99% identical were aligned. the reads in groups containing  <dig> or more reads were visually inspected to detect cases where a single sequence read differed from all others in the group. such differences were scored as errors. there was one such presumptive error for every  <dig> bp, indicating that the error frequency per bp was  <dig> . transitions outnumbered transversions by about  <dig> to  <dig>  as expected  <cit> . the observed error frequency agreed with that expected from an independent estimate of pcr error, which was obtained by sequencing cloned pcr products produced by amplifying a cloned dna fragment . in addition, the error frequency was the same as that reported in a study on errors in sequences from drosophila species  <cit> .

single errors were most common, occurring in  <dig> % of the reads, while  <dig> % contained two errors, and  <dig> % contained three errors. these data were similar to those expected based on poisson probability calculations, which predicted that  <dig> % of the reads would contain  <dig> error, and  <dig> % would contain two errors. however, poisson probability predicted that only  <dig> % would contain three errors. therefore, sequences with three putative errors seemed to be more common than would be expected by chance. nevertheless, statistical analysis of the observed and expected error data  showed the two data sets to be statistically indistinguishable .

analysis of closely related sequence reads identified  <dig> reads that differed from other reads at only one position. given that such minimal divergence could have been due to error, it seemed justifiable to restrict further analysis to the  <dig> reads that differed at more than one site.

reassessment of the number of msg genes in the gene family
previous data had suggested that there are only about  <dig> genes in the family  <cit> . yet, the sequence data contained at least  <dig> genuinely different sequence reads . therefore, the number of genuinely different sequences was at least twice as high as the putative number of genes in the family. this observation prompted a reexamination of the size of the msg gene family.

a quantitative pcr assay was developed based on the fact that all msg genes contain a copy of the crje, by definition, while msr genes do not contain the crje  <cit> . a second primer site was identified approximately  <dig> bp downstream of the crje. at this location, all of the  <dig> sequence reads contained a completely conserved sequence, called c <dig> . therefore, pcr using a crje primer paired with a c <dig> primer should amplify the msg gene family exclusively and exhaustively. the abundance of msg targets was compared to the abundance of ucs targets. the ucs is present in one copy per haploid genome  <cit> . the real-time pcr results indicated that the p. carinii genome contains approximately  <dig> genes encoding msg . these results were consistent with previous estimates  <cit> .

evidence of allelic variation
allelic variation would explain both the presence of very closely related sequences and the apparent excess of different sequences relative to the number of msg genes in the genome. although the p. carinii genome is probably haploid  <cit> , multiple alleles could have been present among the organisms used to obtain sequence reads because the populations of organisms were not necessarily genetically homogeneous. the source of the p. carinii present in the rats used to isolate p. carinii was not well-defined because laboratory rats tend to carry p. carinii, which they can acquire soon after birth  <cit> . in addition, the p. carinii used in the preparation of the various libraries had been obtained from different rats at different points in time. therefore, if different genetic strains of p. carinii exist, more than one could have been represented in the dna used to obtain sequence data.

to examine the possibility that allelic polymorphism contributed to the diversity of msg sequences observed, sequence reads that differed by no more than 5% were grouped. this procedure incorporated all but  <dig> of the original  <dig> sequences into  <dig> groups, and left  <dig> sequences as singletons. the groups varied in size from  <dig> to  <dig> members.

to determine if polymorphism occurred within a group, the reads were aligned and the alignment scanned visually to identify sites that varied in a way that was inconsistent with error. given that the probability of error was  <dig>  per site, the probability that an error would occur twice at a given site was less than  <dig> × 10- <dig>  therefore, observation of a variant nucleotide at the same site in at least two reads in a group would seem to be due to polymorphism, rather than error. based on this criterion, polymorphism was present among the sequence reads in  <dig> of the  <dig> groups . statistical analysis supported the designation of recurrent substitutions as polymorphism, rather than error. for example, reads with two or more substitutions were  <dig> to 28-fold more numerous than would be expected based on the error rate .

a  <dig> reads were assembled  into groups. groups containing less than  <dig> reads are not listed.

b "hv1" means that a polymorphism was seen in hypervariable region  <dig> . numbers in this column refer to the location of the polymorphisms that were not in hv <dig>  each number refers to a nucleotide site where position  <dig> is the a in the atg at the beginning of the crje. because the hv <dig> sequences varied in length, the position-numbers of polymorphisms downstream of hv <dig> cannot be compared between groups.

c an haplotype designated as 1-c had a type  <dig> hypervariable region and a c at a polymorphic site located outside of hv <dig> 

d populations a and b were the source of adam plasmids and lucigen genome project reads, respectively. populations c, d and e were smaller populations that had been analyzed in the past using the same methods as those used to produce the adam plasmid library.

different versions of a group sequence were rarely seen in equivalent numbers. in  <dig> of the  <dig> groups that contained  <dig> or more reads , the majority sequence was at least  <dig> times more frequent than the minority sequence. the predominance of one version of a sequence within a group is inconsistent with the idea that minor sequence variation is due to the presence of very similar genes that reside at different loci, because such a situation would cause the different versions of a sequence to be seen in equal numbers, which was seldom the case.

if a polymorphism reflects allelic variation, then one population might be rich in one allele, while another allele predominates in a second population. by contrast, if two genes gave rise to an observed sequence polymorphism, then both genes will be present in all populations. in group  <dig>  haplotype 1-c was present in  <dig> of the  <dig> reads obtained from adam plasmids , and in  <dig> of  <dig> plasmids from population e, but in only  <dig> of the  <dig> reads from the reads obtained from lucigen plasmids , where haplotype 2-c predominated. the probability of observing these haplotype frequencies under the two-gene model is very low . in group  <dig>  nearly all of the  <dig> sequence reads obtained from lucigen plasmids were haplotype 5-gtaa. however, four other haplotypes were also observed in group  <dig>  if any of these other haplotypes came from a second gene, then the probability of observing  <dig> sequences with the 5-gtaa haplotype among the  <dig> sequences from the lucigen plasmids is very low .

conserved and variable regions in members of the msg gene family
to simplify analysis of variation among the different groups of sequences observed, a consensus sequence for each of the  <dig> sequence groups was produced. combining these  <dig> consensus sequences with the  <dig> singleton sequences produced a set of  <dig> sequences that can be considered to represent the core of the msg gene family.

sequence uniformity in the crje was not quite absolute. two sequence reads, which were identical to one another, contained an a residue at position  <dig> instead of the canonical g residue seen in other copies of the crje . the polymorphism at position  <dig> alters the encoded peptide. variation in the crje has been seen before, but remains quite rare  <cit> .

five hyper-variable regions are depicted in figure  <dig>  all of the hyper-variable regions exhibited a relatively high frequency of base substitution. some hypervariable regions also exhibited frequent and extensive insertions and deletions . to illustrate, hypervariable region  <dig>  began at site  <dig>  where indels were very common. after the indel region,  <dig> of the next  <dig> nucleotide sites exhibited very frequent substitution. the types and locations of the substitutions in region hv <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  which shows the  <dig> different hv <dig> sequences that were observed in the  <dig> groups. figure  <dig> shows that most of the nucleotide variation in groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> occurred in hv <dig>  in addition, in nearly half of the groups with  <dig> or more reads, hv <dig> variation was observed among the sequence reads in the group .

functional significance of nucleotide variation
to assess the functional significance of the nucleotide differences that separate different msg genes, the  <dig> core sequences were translated in silico. all but  <dig> of the core sequences contained an open reading frame encoding an msg polypeptide. these  <dig> translationally competent sequences were aligned using revtrans , which is a program that takes a set of dna sequences, virtually translates them, aligns the peptide sequences, and uses this alignment as a scaffold for constructing the alignment of the corresponding dna sequences  <cit> . sites that did not have the same nucleotide in all  <dig> dna sequences were scored. the changes seen at such sites were categorized as either nonsynonymous or synonymous, based on whether or not a nucleotide change caused a change in the encoded peptide sequence. the number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions and of insertions and deletions were calculated using a program called snap  <cit> .

role of selection in diversification of msg gene family members
statistical analysis of variation among the  <dig> translationally competent core msg sequences showed that the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous variation were significantly different . in addition, the divergence seen in 48% of the  <dig> pairwise comparisons of the  <dig> translationally competent core sequences appeared to have been influenced by positive selection for variation . in figure  <dig>  the line describing non-synonymous differences increases nearly seven times faster than the line describing synonymous differences. this trend is the opposite of what is seen in most genes, where synonymous nucleotide substitutions tend to occur more frequently than non-synonymous substitutions. the prevalence of non-synonymous substitutions suggests that the msg gene family has evolved under the influence of selection in favor of variation . positive selection has long been recognized as an important force in the evolution of both infectious organisms and defenses against them. an example is the major histocompatibility complex , which facilitates the immune response against infectious microorganisms. there is a abundance of non-synonymous variation in the regions of mhc genes that encode the domains that bind microbial antigens  <cit> .

recombination in msg genes
members of the msg gene family share patches of sequence identity, which would be expected to facilitate homologous recombination between family members. therefore, it might be expected that msg genes would tend to recombine with each other. the possibility of recombination was examined in three ways. first the  <dig> sequences were analyzed with rdp <dig> software  <cit> , which showed that each of the  <dig> msg sequences exhibited evidence of recombination with at least one of the other  <dig> msg sequences. figure  <dig> shows an example of evidence suggestive of recombination. sequences g <dig> and a <dig> were identical between positions  <dig> and  <dig> but not downstream of this region, where sequence g <dig> was identical to sequence a <dig>  sequences g <dig> and a <dig> were not identical in the region shared by sequences g <dig> and a <dig>  recombination between msg genes would seem to be the most likely cause of the blocks of sequence identity observed when these three sequences were compared.

recombination was also implicated by analysis of the hv <dig> region. the  <dig> consensus sequences contained  <dig> different sequences in the hv <dig> region. therefore, some hv <dig> sequences were present in more than one gene. for example, hv <dig> sequence  <dig> was present in seven groups. given that the hv <dig> region is so variable that it tends to differ in the different alleles of a gene, the presence of the same hv <dig> sequence in multiple genes would seem to not be due to sequence conservation, but rather be due to recombination events.

as a third test for recombination, subsections of the  <dig> msg genes were analyzed. to start this analysis, each of the  <dig> sequences was divided into three segments, a, b and c, which corresponded to nucleotide positions  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively. then, segments were aligned to the others of their type, i.e., a's were aligned to a's, etc. three neighbor-joining trees, one for each segment, were made. comparison of the three trees revealed many examples where a particular segment sequence occurred in more than one of the  <dig> msg sequences. for example, one 'a' segment sequence occurred in nine different genes, which were different by virtue of the sequence in regions b and c. recombination is the most parsimonious explanation for such gene structures.

pcr can generate recombinants  <cit> . to evaluate the possibility that this type of error contributed to the data, two plasmids, each carrying a distinct msg insert , were mixed together and subjected to pcr amplification. the amplicons were cloned and twelve clones were picked and sequenced. one of these  <dig> cloned plasmids contained a recombinant insert. to determine if this result was indicative of the frequency of recombination, an additional  <dig> clones were screened for recombination by dna hybridization using insert-specific oligonucleotide probes. all of the clones hybridized to one of the two probes utilized, but none hybridized to both. therefore, only one recombinant was present among  <dig> plasmid clones tested, suggesting that the rate at which pcr produced recombinants was approximately  <dig> . at this rate, it is improbable  that more than one of the apparent recombinants observed among the  <dig> msg sequences examined was created during pcr. in addition, any given artifactual recombination event would be relatively rare, and a sequence that is observed multiple times is unlikely to be an artifact. the three presumptive recombinants depicted in figure  <dig> were seen in multiple sequence reads. sequences a <dig>  g <dig> and a <dig> were seen  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times, respectively.

discussion
the relationship between the  <dig> non-identical msg sequences observed and the msg gene family is subject to interpretation. the  <dig> sequences do not represent  <dig> different msg genes because several lines of evidence indicate that there are only about  <dig> msg genes in the genome. these lines of evidence include the results of previous quantitative hybridization experiments  <cit>  and the results of quantitative pcr experiments described herein. the 80-gene family model is also supported by analysis of telomeric regions, where msg genes are clustered. there are  <dig> p. carinii chromosomes each with two telomeres. all  <dig> telomeres were observed to hybridize to an msg probe suggesting that there is at least one msg gene per chromosome end. if so, there must be at least  <dig> msg genes in the genome  <cit> . sequence data obtained from  <dig> large telomeric dna segments cloned into cosmid vectors showed that the average number of msg genes per sequenced chromosome end was  <dig>   <cit> . if the other  <dig> telomeres, which were not present in the cosmid library, adhere to the structures observed in the  <dig> cosmid clones, then the p. carinii genome contains approximately  <dig> msg genes. while the exact number of msg gene at the ends of  <dig> telomeres is not known, each of these locations in the genome appears to contain approximately the same number of msg genes because all telomeric fragments emitted similar amounts of radiation after having been hybridized to a radioactive msg probe  <cit> .

removing reads that could have contained an error reduced the number of different sequences to from  <dig> to  <dig>  a number approximately  <dig> times larger than the estimated size of the gene family. allelic variation would explain this apparent excess of sequence diversity. allelic variation in p. carinii has been described before, but seems to be fairly rare among unique genes  <cit> . however, allelic variation would be expected to be more common in genes that are members of a family that confers the capacity to vary surface antigens at a high rate. allelic variation would also explain the presence of majority and minority sequences in groups of sequences, and fits with the disproportionate presence of these sequences in different populations of p. carinii.

grouping sequence reads that were 95% or more identical produced a set of  <dig> sequences that would appear to represent most if not all of the genes in the msg family. this proposition is supported by three arguments.

first, the set of  <dig> sequences contained  <dig> of  <dig> previously obtained p. carinii msg gene sequences  <cit> . obtaining this result would be improbable if the genome were to contain more than  <dig> different msg gene sequences . however, if the gene copy-number is set at  <dig>  then the observed result is ten times more probable  . similarly, the proposition that the  <dig> core sequences describe all or nearly all of the msg genes in the p. carinii genome was also supported by mark-recapture analysis  <cit> , which produces an estimate of a gene family size from the number of sequences that are seen in two independently derived samples, which in this case were the adam and lucigen libraries. the mark-recapture calculation suggested that the msg gene family contains  <dig> genes. it should be noted, however, that the mark-recapture approach assumes that each msg gene was equally likely to be observed. in fact, some msg genes were observed numerous times while others were observed only once. the unevenness in the coverage of the gene family poses a major caveat when interpreting the accuracy of the results obtained with the mark-recapture analysis.

the second argument in favor of the proposition that the  <dig> sequences comprise a fairly complete picture of the family is that the methods used to produce the sequence reads would be expected to capture dna segments from all msg genes. the inserts in the plasmid libraries were generated by pcr that relied on priming from sequences  that are conserved among members of the gene family. by definition, msg genes begin with a copy of the crje. therefore, priming from the crje should amplify all msg genes that contain a copy of the c <dig> region. lack of the c <dig> region from one or more msg gene is theoretically possible. however, analysis of sequences in the genome project database showed that the c <dig> primer binding site was present in all  <dig> sequence reads that contained the crje and were long enough to contain the c <dig> region. therefore, if the genome contains msg genes that would fail to be amplified by the primers employed, there are very few such genes. even if the reliance on the presence of the c <dig> region had caused some genes to be excluded from the adam plasmid library, the genome project database would not be expected to be similarly deficient because this database was obtained by methods that did not rely on sequence conservation.

the third argument supporting the proposition that the  <dig> sequences comprise a fairly complete picture of the family is that the database of  <dig> sequence reads would seem to be large enough to virtually assure that all members of the family would be represented within it. assuming that the gene family contains  <dig> genes, then the calculated probability of observing all family members by sampling  <dig> times is approximately  <dig> . the exact size of the p. carinii msg gene family is not known, but quantitative pcr experiments indicated that it contains no more than  <dig> genes. if there are  <dig> genes in the family, then the calculated probability of observing all family members by sampling  <dig> times is still very high, approximately  <dig> . while the number of sequence reads obtained would seem to have been sufficient to produce a complete picture of the family, a caveat to this proposition arises from uncertainty about sample completeness. sampling an 80-gene family  <dig> times should cover the family an average of  <dig> times. therefore, the average coverage per gene should be approximately  <dig> fold. yet,  <dig> of the different sequences in the set of  <dig> were seen only once, and the  <dig> largest groups of reads contained between  <dig> and  <dig> sequence reads each. these data depart significantly from expectations based on probability, which predict that no more than three of the genes would be represented less than twice or more than  <dig> times. cloning bias is the probable cause of this deviation from expectation. it is commonly observed that some parts of genomes are relatively resistant to cloning in bacterial vectors. another factor that probably contributed to the observed unevenness in coverage was that technical problems made it necessary to pursue the pneumocystis genome project in a manner that would not be expected to produce equal coverage of the genome . whatever caused it, uneven coverage of the gene family would increase the chance of missing genes. new sequencing techniques that do not rely on cloning should help in addressing the possibility of missing data in the set of  <dig> sequences. although control experiments showed that mis-incorporation of nucleotides and recombination during pcr are rare enough to discount these events as significant sources of the  <dig> sequences that were seen only once, the best way to confirm that a sequence is correct is to show that it can be reproducibly obtained. therefore, more sequence data will be needed to confirm that the  <dig> singleton sequences are correct.

the set of  <dig> core msg sequences contained three regions  where there was little to no variation in at least  <dig> contiguous nucleotide positions. several other smaller regions  also exhibited no variation among the  <dig> sequences. conservation of these sequence elements cannot be ascribed to selection against changes in the encoded primary protein sequence because such selection would not prevent synonymous variation. therefore, it would appear that the conserved nucleotides perform a function separate from and in addition to encoding an amino acid.

one possible function of conserved dna sequence elements is to facilitate dna recombination. data described herein and previous studies indicate that donor msg genes have recombined with each other  <cit> . conserved sequence elements facilitate the dna strand exchanges that occur during recombination.  <cit> . conserved dna sequence elements can also serve as targets for a site-specific nucleases, which generate a double stranded gap that is repaired via recombination with a related dna sequences  <cit> . such repairs are often called gene conversions because the dna that fills the gap is copied from donor dna while it is being inserted. therefore the donor dna remains unchanged. sometimes gap repair also causes crossing-over  <cit> . saccharomyces cerevisiae has several such nucleases including ho, spo <dig> and i-sce <dig>  <cit> . ho and spo <dig> function in controlling mating type and meiotic recombination, respectively. therefore, these types of enzymes are needed to perform fundamental functions, and it would not be surprising if p. carinii possesses site-specific nucleases. another possible role for conserved sequence elements would be as sites for site-specific recombinases, which are enzymes that catalyze crossovers by facilitating breakage and reunion between two copies of the site recognized by the recombinase  <cit> .

comparing the msg genes at the expression site to donor msg genes might allow assessment of the roles of crossing-over and gene conversion in creating the sequence diversity at the expression site. for example, if the gene at the expression site were installed there by a reciprocal cross-over, then the gene that is at the expression site will have vacated its former locus and been replaced by the gene that was formerly at the expression site. on the other hand, if gene conversion causes a change at the expression site, then the same sequence will exist at both the expression site and the donor site.

while high conservation of nucleotide tracts in msg genes might be needed to foster recombination, such conservation causes high conservation in certain parts of msg proteins, which would seem problematic if the function of msgs is to impart surface variation. however, the functional ramifications of diverse msg proteins containing invariant regions will be influenced by other factors, such post-translational processing and three-dimensional structure. the region encoded by the ucs and crje appears to be present on the msg proteins when they are first produced, but not present on msg proteins on the cell surface  <cit> . the protein segments encoded by the c <dig> and c <dig> regions are rich in hydrophobic amino acids and are probably buried within the msg molecule, it which case, they would be unlikely to be detected by the host immune system.

the nucleotides located between conserved regions varied to different degrees. the hv <dig> region was the most clearly delineated, being located between the crje and c <dig>  which are both very highly conserved. other hypervariable regions had less distinct borders. sequence variation included base substitutions and indels. substitutions often were nonsynonymous, a finding that suggests that selection has favored changes that change the msg protein encoded  <cit> . selection for variation is consistent with the idea that msg genes confer the ability to deploy protective antigenic variation. high frequency protein-changing nucleotide variation has been observed to extend beyond the first  <dig> bps of msg genes, and probably does so in most if not all msg genes. previous analysis of  <dig> complete msg genes showed that they varied throughout their length and that positive selection caused much of this variation  <cit> .

indels did not often alter the reading frame because the number of nucleotides involved in nearly all indels was divisible by  <dig>  it is interesting to note that despite the great variation seen among the  <dig> sequence reads, nearly all of these reads contained an open reading frame encoding an msg protein. these findings suggest that the entire gene family is under selective pressure to continue encoding intact msg proteins that differ one from another.

some of the regions in which indels were prevalent contained simple repeats, such as short run of a:t base pairs. such mononucleotide repeats are more prone to change in size due to slippage of dna polymerase during genome replication, repair and recombination  <cit> . however, most of the indels involved more complex sequences that did not appear to have been formed via interactions between short identical repeats.

CONCLUSIONS
a set of sequences that represents most if not all of the members of the p. carinii msg gene family was obtained. the protein-changing nature of the variation among these sequences suggests that the family has been shaped by selection for protein variation, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the msg gene family functions to enhance phenotypic variation among the members of a population of p. carinii.

understanding the p. carinii msg gene family at the sequence level provides an avenue through which to assess the function of this family, which is currently unknown, but presumably contributes to the ability of the fungus to parasitize its host, rattus norwegicus. with the improved understanding of the family provided by the studies described herein, it should be possible to determine if changes at the expression site involve gene conversions, crossovers, or both. it should also be possible to learn more about the rate and mechanism of evolution of msg genes, which would be expected to be occurring rapidly via selection for mutation and recombination.
