BACKGROUND
neural crest cells  are a multipotent population of cells that arise from dorsal regions of the neural tube during early stages of embryonic development  <cit> . due to their critical importance to a wide variety of tissues, deficiencies of nccs underlie a highly prevalent group of congenital disorders termed neurocristopathies that include craniofacial anomalies and cardiac outflow tract defects  <cit> . understanding the genetic programs controlling ncc development is therefore essential to provide insight to the origins and potential treatment of a large number of birth defects.

different populations of nccs are defined by the position at which they arise along the antero-posterior axis. cranial nccs arise anterior to somite  <dig> and give rise to bone, cartilage and tendons of the head, as well as sensory and sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system. vagal nccs arise between somites 1– <dig> and give rise to the neurons and glia of the enteric nervous system and to cardiac nccs which form vascular smooth muscle lining the pharyngeal arch arteries and also contribute to the aortic-pulmonary septum. trunk nccs arise posterior to the 4th somite and give rise to neurons and glia of the sensory and sympathetic nervous system, schwann cells and melanocytes  <cit> .

within these broad axially defined regions, nccs can be further divided into sub-populations based on their migratory path and developmental fate. for example, cranial nccs spanning the region between the mid-diencephalon and 5th somite are segregated into distinct migratory streams which mirror the transient segmentation of the neural tube into lineage-restricted units such as the diencephalon, midbrain and the hindbrain rhombomeres   <cit> . cranial nccs emigrating from each axial level follow distinct paths that drive segregation into distinct migratory streams that are maintained as these cells navigate the cranial mesenchyme. thus, cranial nccs arising anterior to r <dig>  including those from the diencephaplon, midbrain and r1-r <dig>  migrate into the frontonasal process, maxilla and first pharyngeal arch , whereas r4-derived nccs migrate into pa <dig>  nccs populating these regions also give rise to specific structures such as meckel’s cartilage, incus, malleus and trigeminal ganglia  in pa <dig>  and middle ear ossicle and stapes, hyoid bone and facioacoustic ganglia  in pa <dig>  <cit> .

migration of cranial nccs within these distinct streams is under control of cell intrinsic and environmental cues that include several ligand-receptor pairs from the eph/ephrin , erbb/neuregulin  <cit> , sdf/cxcr  <cit>  and vegfa/semaphorin/neuropilin signalling pathways . neuropilins  are transmembrane co-receptors for guidance molecules of the class  <dig> semaphorin  family and for heparin binding isoforms of the vascular endothelial growth factor vegfa  <cit> . during early stages of cranial ncc development nrp <dig> expression is restricted to nccs within the r <dig> migratory stream while nrp <dig> is restricted to nccs within the r1-r <dig> migratory stream  <cit> . using an inducible cre/loxp lineage tracing system the nrp <dig> expressing cranial nccs were further found to give rise to r1-r <dig> derived structures such as the trigeminal ganglia   <cit> . mouse knockouts of nrp <dig> and nrp <dig> further demonstrate an essential requirement for these receptors in promoting migration of nccs within different streams. thus, r4-derived nccs migrate aberrantly in nrp <dig> knockout mice, and r1-r2-derived nccs migrate aberrantly in nrp <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . in chick, nrp <dig> is also expressed by nccs in the r <dig> migratory stream and controls migration toward vegfa secreted by the surface ectoderm  <cit> . although neuropilins recruit signalling co-receptors such as the a-type plexins  and vegf receptors  to control axonal guidance  <cit> , vascular growth  <cit>  and motor neuron migration  <cit> , the signalling co-receptors recruited in nccs remain unknown.

positional identity of nccs along the antero-posterior axis is thought to be acquired prior to migration and to be under control of homeodomain transcription factors that promote segmentation and patterning of the rhombomeres from which the nccs arise  <cit> . thus, the unique combination of homeobox  genes along the antero-posterior axis is likely to underlie the molecular differences of the distinct migratory streams. indeed, distinct hox expression profiles have also been identified in nccs arising at different axial levels. however, as hox expression in nccs is under control of distinct enhancers, the hox genetic code in nccs differs from their original rhombomeric tissue  <cit> . while the distinct expression profiles of the hox genes and neuropilins demonstrate that nccs of different migratory streams are molecularly distinct, the extent of these differences and the regulatory networks controlling their unique identity remain unknown.

here we have uncovered the transcriptional profiles of cranial nccs arising anterior to r <dig>  and r <dig> migratory streams by performing rna sequencing  on purified populations of cranial nccs. our rna-seq, rt-pcr and in situ hybridisation analyses reveal many previously unappreciated transcripts showing differential expression between these distinct streams of cells. we also explored the expression of potential neuropilin co-receptors and show that a-type plexins are differentially expressed between these cranial ncc streams. our analyses identify a large number of genes differentially expressed between cranial nccs arising at different axial levels, providing a comprehensive resource for future analysis of these cellular populations.

RESULTS
isolation of cranial ncc streams
previous studies have shown that nccs arising anterior to r <dig> are molecularly distinct to nccs within the r <dig> migratory stream  <cit> . however, the extent of these differences has not previously been defined at the whole transcriptome level. to explore the transcriptional differences between these streams at embryonic day   <dig>   when nccs are actively migrating within the head and branchial arch tissue, we established a fluorescence activated cell sorting  technique to isolate nccs from each stream. for this procedure we inter-crossed wnt1cre with z/eg mice to permanently label all nccs and their derivatives with green fluorescent protein  . as wnt1cre is also expressed in the midbrain   <cit>  we removed any gfp positive neural tissue prior to cell dissociation and facs. tissue anterior to r <dig> containing nccs emigrating from the mid-diencephalon through to r1-r <dig>  and tissue between r <dig> and r <dig> containing nccs emigrating from r <dig> were dissected away from the trunk tissue under a dissecting fluorescent microscope . as these dissected regions contained only a small number of cells, tissue from gfp-negative littermates were added to boost cell numbers for facs. gfp-positive nccs were isolated from  <dig> individual wnt1cre; z/eg litters . on average we isolated approximately  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  gfp-positive cells from the r1-r <dig>  r <dig> and trunk regions, respectively . purification of gfp-positive nccs was validated by qrt-pcr for gfp and the ncc marker sox <dig> . while this analysis showed enrichment of sox <dig> in the gfp-positive nccs, expression was also observed in the gfp-negative cells as sox <dig> is expressed in nccs from gfp-negative embryos used to boost cell numbers as well as non-ncc cell-types such as the otic vesicle .fig.  <dig> isolation of gfp-positive nccs. a wholemount e <dig>  wnt1cre; z/eg embryos immunolabelled for gfp identifies nccs in the r1- <dig>  and r <dig> migratory streams, and additional wnt <dig> expression domains within the mid brain . b

dynamic expression of neuropilins in cranial nccs
our previous expression analyses demonstrated that nrp <dig> and nrp <dig> are differentially expressed in r1-r <dig> and r4-derived cranial nccs at e <dig> -e <dig>   <cit> . expression levels of nrp <dig> and nrp <dig> were therefore compared between nccs from the r1-r <dig> and r <dig> migratory streams to validate that neuropilins are indeed differentially regulated in these streams at e <dig> . consistent with our previous results  <cit>  we found an increase of nrp <dig> expression in nccs from the r <dig> migratory stream . however, there was no difference in the expression of nrp <dig> between r1-r <dig> and r4-derived nccs . to clarify this unexpected result, we investigated the expression of nrp <dig> and nrp <dig> by in situ hybridisation from e <dig> -e <dig> . consistent with our previous analysis we found that nrp <dig> expression was limited to r4-derived nccs and that nrp <dig> expression was restricted to r1-r2-derived nccs at e <dig> - <dig>  . at e <dig>  when nccs begin to differentiate and accumulate into the cranial ganglia, the expression of nrp <dig> remained strong within the r <dig> migratory stream and the anlagen of the facioacoustic cranial ganglia, and was also observed at lower levels within nccs located in the r1-r <dig> migratory stream . however, while nrp <dig> expression remained high within the r1-r <dig> migratory stream and trigeminal ganglia at e <dig> , we also observed expression within r4-derived nccs . by e <dig>  the expression of nrp <dig> and nrp <dig> was observed within ncc derivatives from both the r1-r <dig> and r <dig> migratory streams: nrp <dig> expression was expressed in a subset of cells within the trigeminal and facioacoustic ganglia, while nrp <dig> was observed within the r1-r2-derived trigeminal ganglia and within the facioacoustic ganglia . taken together with our previous results, this analysis demonstrates that the expression of nrp <dig> and nrp <dig> are differentially expressed in the r1-r <dig> and r <dig> streams prior to e <dig> , but soon thereafter become expressed in nccs and ncc derivatives of both streams.fig.  <dig> expression of nrp <dig> and nrp <dig> in cranial neural crest cells. a-b) qrt-pcr for nrp <dig>  and nrp <dig>  in facs isolated r1-r <dig> and r <dig> ncc streams. a

rna sequencing reveals the expression profiles of r1-r <dig> and r4-derived nccs
to determine the transcriptional profiles of nccs in the r1-r <dig> and r <dig> migratory streams we performed rna-seq on each purified population across  <dig> independent wnt1cre; z/eg litters . sequence generated from litters c and d had low mapping rates  and failed to cluster with other samples in principal component analysis . while reduced mapping rates for the r <dig> stream indicate a small degree of contamination by non-murine cell types, expression profiles were normalised within and between samples by only using reads that map within mouse genes. by combining expression profiles of litter a and litter b we found that the r1-r <dig> and r <dig> streams had largely concordant expression profiles with 89% of genes showing similar expression in both samples  . within each sample we observed abundant expression of bona fide ncc markers, including crabp <dig>  snai <dig>  sox <dig>  foxd <dig>  sox <dig>  id1- <dig>  tfap2a, ets <dig>  ngfr and lin <dig>   <cit> . indeed, we also found high concordance between our dataset and that of previous microarray analysis of mouse nccs isolated from the first branchial arch and rna-seq of chick cranial nccs. of  <dig> genes found to be expressed specifically in mouse nccs of the first arch, we found 87% expressed within either the r1-r <dig> or r <dig> streams  <cit> . moreover, 84% and 83% of genes up regulated in chick nccs were also found in our datasets of r1-r <dig> and r <dig>  respectively   <cit> .fig.  <dig> transcriptome of r1-r <dig> and r4-derived nccs. a venn diagram illustrating the number of genes co-expressed in r1-r <dig> and r4-derived mouse nccs compared to chick cranial nccs. b transcriptome analysis identified  <dig> genes enriched in r1-r2-derived nccs  and  <dig> genes enriched in r4-derived nccs . several bona fide ncc genes are expressed abundantly in both populations of cells 




comparative expression analysis between r1-r <dig> and r <dig> identified a total of  <dig> genes meeting criteria for differential expression and included  <dig> genes up regulated in r1-r <dig> and  <dig> genes up regulated in r <dig> . gene ontology enrichment analysis of these results identified embryonic limb morphogenesis and skeletal development as the only over represented biological pathways for genes up-regulated in r1-r <dig> , while response to retinoic acid was the only over represented biological pathway for genes up-regulated in r <dig> . enrichment of genes within these biological processes fits well with the established roles of the retinoic acid pathway in ncc development  <cit>  and the essential roles of nccs in formation of the craniofacial skeleton  <cit> . within the list of genes showing significant differences it is notable that alx <dig>  alx <dig> and alx <dig> are known to be up-regulated in ncc derivatives of the r1-r <dig> migratory stream, while hoxa <dig>  hoxb <dig> and ret are also known to be expressed in nccs of the r <dig> migratory stream . although not meeting criteria for significance, preferential expression of nrp <dig> and otx <dig> in either the r1-r <dig> or r <dig> migratory streams also fits well with previous findings  <cit> .table  <dig> genes up-regulated in r1-r2-derived nccs. top  <dig> genes significantly up-regulated in the r1-r <dig> ncc migratory stream as defined via cuffdiff and edger. inf refers to an infinite log <dig> fold change due to a value of  <dig> in r4-derived nccs





validation of differentially expressed genes
transcriptomic analysis identified a number of genes differentially regulated between the r1-r <dig> and r <dig> migratory streams indicating that these populations are indeed different. to validate this data we performed semi-quantitative rt-pcr on cdna from regions of r1-r <dig> and r <dig> dissected from wild type e <dig>  embryos. eight transcripts were selected from the differentially expressed genes identified from the analysis of litter a-b . in comparison to β-actin  all genes showed an expression pattern replicating the transcriptomic data, with alx <dig>  pax <dig>  nkx <dig>  and sp <dig> demonstrating higher expression in r1-r <dig>  and hoxa <dig>  anxa <dig>  tgfb <dig> and efhd <dig> demonstrating higher expression in r4-derived nccs . to further validate gene expression we selected two genes previously unknown to be expressed in nccs and performed in situ hybridisation on e <dig>  wild type embryos . nkx <dig>  expression was observed in the floor plate of the neural tube where it has previously been implicated in the organisation and development of neural networks  <cit> , and within periocular cranial mesenchyme . anxa <dig> expression was observed within blood vessels throughout the entire body and within the second branchial arch tissue, which is predominantly comprised of nccs from r <dig> . rt-pcr and in situ hybridisation analysis therefore corroborates our transcriptomic analysis. taken together, these studies identify a large number of genes differentially regulated in the r1-r <dig> and r <dig> populations of nccs. to explore if our dataset could be used to identify regulatory networks promoting r1-r <dig> or r <dig> ncc identity we used opossum to search for transcription factor binding sites over-represented in the promoter regions of genes up-regulated in r1-r <dig> or r <dig>  <cit> . however, cross referencing of the top  <dig> over-represented transcription factors  against our list of significantly up-regulated data was unable to uncover any genes potentially acting as master regulators of these different streams.fig.  <dig> validation of differentially expressed genes. a rt-pcr validation of genes significantly up regulated from r1-r <dig> and r4-derived nccs. b-c whole mount and sectioned in situ hybridisation of nkx <dig>   and anxa <dig>  validates rnaseq expression data. nkx <dig>  and is observed within the periocular mesenchyme  populated by r1-r2-derived nccs. anxa <dig> expression is observed within blood vessels and the second branchial arch which is populated by r4-derived nccs . ov, otic vesicle; e, eye. scale bars = 500um




differential expression of neuropilin coreceptors in cranial nccs
we next asked if the dataset could be used to identify putative nrp <dig> and nrp <dig> co-receptors controlling migration of the different migratory streams. although plxna1- <dig> and vegfr1-r <dig> are the archetypical neuropilin co-receptors, several other receptors have been suggested to interact with neuropilins or sema <dig>  including plxnb1- <dig>  plxnc <dig>  plxnd <dig>  l1cam, nrcam, cd <dig>  met, robo1- <dig> and ptk <dig> . within our dataset we were unable to find expression of vegfr1-r <dig>  plxnb <dig>  cd <dig> or robo1- <dig> which is consistent with previous reports and the known roles of these receptors in other cell types . amongst the other putative neuropilin co-receptors plxna <dig>  plxna <dig>  plxna <dig>  plxnd <dig> and met had differential expression in the r1-r <dig> and r4-derived nccs. while a previous study has shown that plxna <dig> and plxna <dig> are not required for trunk ncc migration, their expression profiling raised the intriguing possibility that these receptors may be expressed in cranial nccs  <cit> . we therefore investigated the expression of plxna1- <dig> in the head by in situ hybridisation. at e <dig>  plxna <dig> was expressed diffusely throughout the entire embryo with highest expression in the frontonasal process, premaxilla and neural tube . longitudinal sections through the head counterstained with antibodies specific for the p <dig> neurotrophin receptor , a marker of nccs, further demonstrated highest expression in the neural tube with lower expression in ncc and non-ncc mesenchyme . plxna <dig> was expressed within the frontonasal process, premaxilla, diencephalon, hindbrain rhombomeres, r1-r <dig> and r4-derived nccs . plxna <dig> was expressed diffusely throughout the head mesenchyme and neural tube with heightened expression within the frontonasal process, premaxilla and facioacoustic cranial ganglia arising from nccs in the r <dig> migratory stream . plxna <dig> was expressed highest in nccs within the r <dig> migratory stream and at lower levels in a subset of nccs within the r1-r <dig> migratory stream . taken together, our transcriptomic and in situ hybridisation analyses demonstrate that a-type plexins are expressed in an overlapping pattern in cranial nccs.fig.  <dig> a-type plexins are expressed within cranial nccs. a-p wholemount in situ hybridisation of wild type e <dig>  embryos  were sectioned longitudinally  and immunolabelled for ngfr  to identify migrating nccs. a-e

discussion
in this study we have used whole transcriptome profiling to reveal the genetic signatures of cranial nccs arising from different axial levels. a large body of work in chick and zebrafish has previously defined gene regulatory networks that sequentially control: 1) specification of ncc precursors at the neural plate border, 2) specification of bona fide nccs from the neuroepithelium, and 3) diversification of nccs post delamination  <cit> . under this model, a hierarchy of transcription factor combinations are proposed to drive different developmental stages, with neural crest specifier genes inducing formation of bona fide nccs from their neuroepithelial precursors, and neural crest effector genes instructing ncc proliferation, migration and differentiation. our current study shows that cranial nccs from mice express a similar repertoire of specifier and effector genes to that seen in chick  <cit>  and demonstrates that conserved genetic networks control ncc development across multiple species. in chick, sox <dig> and ets <dig> have also been shown to act as common enhancers of cranial ncc identity  <cit> . in further support of this notion, we identified sox <dig> binding sites within the promoter regions of 77% and 82% of genes up-regulated in r <dig> and r1-r <dig>  respectively.

our findings also support the notion that different combinations of neural crest effector genes orchestrate the diverse developmental fates and migration paths of nccs arising at different axial levels. thus, our analysis identified distinct expression signatures for each ncc stream, including  <dig> transcription factors specific for r1-r <dig>  and  <dig> transcription factors specific for r4-derived nccs. enrichment of the aristaless-like homeobox gene transcription factors alx <dig>  alx <dig> and alx <dig> within r1-r2-derived nccs is in strong agreement with previous findings linking these genes to early ncc development and craniofacial disorders . moreover, identification of genes previously found enriched in nccs arising anterior to r <dig> provides confidence that our dataset uncovers genetic networks underlying the diversity of nccs arising at different axial levels. amongst the other transcription factors specific to the r1-r <dig> stream ferd3l has also been implicated in the craniofacial disorder saethre-chotzen syndrome  <cit> , however, the remaining transcription factors have unknown roles in cranial nccs. sp <dig> and sp <dig> are both members of the sp/klf transcription factor family that have essential roles in organising craniofacial, limb and interneuron development  <cit> . although sp <dig> is primarily required by the anterior neural ridge and olfactory pit to regulate craniofacial development  <cit> , it’s expression pattern is also consistent with a putative role in the frontonasal process at e <dig>  in mice  <cit> . expression of sp <dig>  on the other hand, is thought to be restricted to the ganglionic eminences and developing limb of mice post e <dig>   <cit> . while this is inconsistent with our data set, it is possible that prior analyses have not been sensitive enough to detect low levels of expression in nccs at e <dig> , as would be predicted by our data. the identification of sox <dig>  which is known to regulate neurogenesis, also suggests that our data set uncovers genetic networks at play in the differentiation phase of ncc development  <cit> . indeed, this is further highlighted by the over-representation of genes regulating skeletal development in the r1-r <dig> data set, including alx <dig>  alx <dig>  alx <dig>  shh and pax <dig> 

in contrast to nccs that populate pa <dig>  nccs contributing to the second and more posterior pharyngeal arches are known to express various combinations of hox genes. accordingly, our analysis uncovered numerous hox family members specific to r4-derived nccs. hoxa <dig> was the most abundant member of this family and has well established roles in patterning second arch derivatives through regulating expression of effector genes such as meox <dig>  <cit> , which was also enriched in r4-derived nccs. hoxb <dig> is exclusively expressed in r <dig> derived nccs  <cit>  and has essential roles in controlling formation of the facioacoustic ganglia  <cit> . hoxc <dig> and hoxc <dig> were enriched in r4-derived nccs but have unknown functions in this stream. hoxc <dig> is predicted to have overlapping functions with its paralogue hoxb <dig> that has been shown to regulate expression of ret in vagal nccs  <cit> . ret was also identified in our data set and previously shown to be enriched in r4-derived nccs  <cit> . another notable observation with the r <dig> data set is the over-representation of retinoic acid responsive genes including hsd17b <dig>  pparg, abca <dig>  ret, hoxa <dig> and rbp <dig>  taken together with the finding that retinoic acid preferentially affects migration of r4-derived nccs in chick  <cit> , this suggests that this population of nccs are more responsive to retinoic acid than nccs arising anterior to r <dig> 

previous expression profiling and phenotypic analysis of nrp <dig> and nrp <dig> knockout mice supports the proposal that nrp <dig> guides r4-derived nccs into pa <dig>  and that nrp <dig> guides r1-r2-derived nccs into pa <dig>  <cit> . indeed, complete fusion of the trigeminal and facioacoustic ganglia in compound nrp1; nrp <dig> knockout embryos highlights a critical role for these receptors in guiding neuroglial fated cranial nccs  <cit> . while these receptors are expressed in exclusive domains at the earliest stages of ncc migration, our current analysis shows that they become co-expressed in the same populations of nccs and ncc derivatives as they condense into the cranial ganglia. taken in context, the knockout phenotypes suggest that the neuropilins are required for promoting migration into distinct streams at the initial stages of ncc migration and in controlling axonal guidance after the cranial ganglia differentiate  <cit> .

although none of the neuropilin co-receptors were identified in our comparative transcriptome analysis, in situ hybridisation suggests that plxna1-a <dig> are differentially expressed in nccs arising at different axial levels. plxna1-a <dig> are archetypical neuropilin co-receptors that predominantly convey signals upon binding of sema <dig> during peripheral and central nervous system development  <cit> . given their overlapping expression profiles it will now be of interest to address the roles of these receptors in controlling cranial ncc migration. in searching for additional mechanisms that may be involved in controlling cranial ncc migration it was notable that the receptor tyrosine kinase ret and the gaba receptor gabre were the only membrane receptors identified in our analysis. ret is essential for migration of enteric nccs within the gut but additional roles in controlling migration of r4-derived nccs are currently unknown  <cit> . gaba receptors are also known to modulate the proliferation and differentiation of ncc derived boundary cap cells  <cit> . it will now be of interest to test if ret or gabre have specific roles in the r1-r <dig> or r <dig> population of nccs.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our studies uncover the transcriptional landscape that underpins diversity of cranial nccs arising from different axial levels. this gene list provides novel insight to the regulatory networks controlling the formation of specific skeletal elements and to the mechanisms promoting migration along different paths.
