BACKGROUND
meiosis is a specialized cell division process, which includes premeiotic dna synthesis, dna recombination followed by two rounds of cell division, and gametogenesis  <cit> . it has been shown in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe <cit>  and the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit>  that a number of transcription factors dramatically modulate the transcriptome to facilitate meiosis, thereby playing critical roles in meiotic progression and sporulation . in addition to transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional regulation plays a fundamental role in the progression of meiosis and gametogenesis in higher eukaryotes. for example, cessation of transcription followed by complex translational activation and repression of stored maternal mrnas occurs in xenopus oocytes during meiotic progression   <cit> . in fission yeast, a specialized regulation of meiosis, called selective elimination of meiosis-specific mrnas, facilitates the post-transcriptional degradation of meiotic mrnas during the mitotic cell cycle  <cit> . we were interested in elucidating any additional post-transcriptional regulation that might contribute to the dynamic changes observed in gene expression during meiosis in the fission yeast.

the spo <dig> mutant was isolated as a sporulation-deficient mutant in the original genetic screen of defective mutants in meiotic progression and/or sporulation, performed nearly half a century ago  <cit> . previous studies have indicated that the spo5+ gene encodes a meiosis-specific rna-binding protein, carrying two rna-recognition motifs  in the c-terminal part , and regulates the progression of meiosis ii and spore formation  <cit> . although it seems apparent that spo <dig> plays an essential role to coordinate meiosis and sporulation, controlling a number of targets, the rna molecules that bind to spo <dig> have not yet been identified, except for our recent finding that cdc13
+
 mrna, encoding cyclin b, can do so  <cit> . because spo <dig> is likely to be involved in post-transcriptional events during meiosis, such as pre-mrna processing, mrna export, translation, and mrna degradation, we analyzed this rna-binding protein to evaluate its functions.

in this report, we demonstrate that the rrms on spo <dig> are essential for its cytoplasmic localization, where it exerts its function. spo <dig> appears to be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through the rae1-dependent mrna export pathway, but is unlikely to be involved in general mrna export. we also show that one of the critical target rna molecules for spo <dig> is pcr1
+
 mrna. pcr <dig> belongs to the atf/creb family of transcription factors, which consists of four members in fission yeast: pcr <dig>  atf <dig>  atf <dig>  and atf <dig>  the functional relationship between spo <dig> and pcr <dig> is also analyzed.

RESULTS
rna recognition motifs are essential for the localization and function of spo5
first, we evaluated the mechanism underlying the subcellular localization of spo <dig>  a previous study suggested that the c-terminal half of spo <dig> is required for its cytoplasmic localization  <cit> . as this region contains the rrms, we examined whether these might be responsible for the localization of spo <dig>  we constructed a series of truncation mutants that lacked the rrm region . each mutant carried the mutated spo <dig> gene in place of the wild-type gene on the chromosome, and expressed the mutant protein from the authentic spo <dig> promoter. all truncated mutant proteins that lacked at least one rrm showed abnormal nuclear accumulation, as indicated by the fluorescent signals of fused green fluorescent protein  . we confirmed that mutant proteins were produced in a comparable amount to wild-type spo <dig>  by examining the shortest mutant spo <dig> and the rrm2-deletion mutant, although the protein level might be slightly lower in the latter case . the rrm truncation mutants were defective in sporulation , suggesting that the existence of intact rrms is correlated with the cytoplasmic localization and proper function of spo <dig>  while we could not exclude the possibility that some of the effect of the mutations on sporulation might be due to lower levels of the mutant proteins, the effect on sporulation was apparently more dramatic than the effect on protein levels, supporting the importance of the rrms/cytoplasmic localization in spo <dig> function.there was one exception, namely spo5-gfp, which has two rrms but lacks the c-terminal region. although it localized mostly to the cytoplasm, it was not functional, whereas spo5-gfp, which has two rrms and an additional c-terminal portion, was functional . this indicates that, in addition to intact rrms, the c-terminal region adjacent to the second rrm is essential for the spo <dig> function.

to clarify whether rna-binding is required for spo <dig> localization and function, we introduced missense mutations to the conserved motifs in rrms. we constructed mutant strains that were similar to the f341a and f427a mutations previously analyzed by kasama and colleagues  <cit> . all of the mutant proteins, namely spo5–gfp, spo5–gfp, and spo5–gfp, accumulated in the nucleus, as did the rrm-truncated proteins . these mutants were also deficient in sporulation . similar, or slightly lower production of spo <dig> protein compared to the wild-type was confirmed . the nuclear localization of these mutated spo5-gfp proteins in our study was somewhat different from that observed in the previous study, which reported that spo5-gfp shows a punctate distribution in both the cytoplasm and nucleus  <cit> . our precise analysis suggested that spo <dig> protein might exhibit punctate cytoplasmic distribution during early meiotic stages such as the horsetail-movement and one-nucleus stages . the apparent difference in localization may also reflect changes in the strain construction: in the previous study, the spo <dig> mutant allele was integrated into the chromosomal leu <dig> locus, whereas the mutant allele was integrated in the authentic spo <dig> locus in our case. however, the actual reasons remain unclear.

we also performed a genetic screen for novel missense mutants of spo <dig> that were defective in meiosis and sporulation, and isolated more than ten different mutants including spo <dig> and spo <dig>  both of which contained a mutation in the rrm domain. when assayed at 30°c, spo5–gfp accumulated in the nucleus as did spo5–gfp, but spo5–gfp did not, showing a unique phenotype . because aromatic residues in the rrm, such as f <dig>  have been shown to interact directly with rna  <cit> , we speculated that the rna-binding of spo <dig> might be important for its cytoplasmic localization.

spo <dig> localizes to the cytoplasm via the mrna export pathway
rrms appear to be essential for the translocation of spo <dig> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. therefore, we investigated whether spo <dig> might be exported to the cytoplasm via the mrna export machinery using a mutant of the mrna export factor, rae <dig>  the rae1-dependent pathway is conserved from the budding yeast  <cit>  to humans  <cit> . the fission yeast rae1- <dig> mutant exhibited defective mrna export at restrictive temperatures  <cit> . we induced meiosis in wild-type  and rae1- <dig> cells at 25°c, the latter of which produced spo <dig> protein in a comparable or slightly lower amount , and transferred the cells to 36°c to inactivate rae1- <dig>  in wt cells, spo5–gfp was mainly localized to the cytoplasm both at 25°c and 36°c . by contrast, spo5–gfp accumulated in the nucleus in rae1- <dig> cells at the restrictive temperature . this suggests that spo <dig> is likely to be exported to the cytoplasm via the mrna export machinery. consistent with this idea, spo <dig> accumulated in the nucleus when mrna synthesis was inhibited by the addition of  <dig> -phenanthroline . we also noticed that sporulation was markedly inefficient in rae1- <dig> cells , indicating that rae <dig> plays an important role in meiotic progression and sporulation.

next, we investigated the possible involvement of the exportin-mediated mrna export pathway  <cit>  in the localization of spo <dig>  ran gtpase is known as the major organizer of importin/exportin-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport  <cit> . when the ran–exportin nuclear export pathway was blocked with leptomycin b , a potent inhibitor of exportin/crm <dig>  <cit> , spo5–gfp remained in the cytoplasm , demonstrating that exportin/crm <dig> is dispensable for the export of spo <dig> 

to examine whether spo <dig> itself is a component of the mrna transport machinery, we monitored the localization of the poly -binding protein , which has been shown to accumulate in the nucleus in the rae1- <dig> mutant  <cit> . pabp–gfp was found to localize in the cytoplasm in spo5∆ cells , suggesting that spo <dig> is not an mrna export factor.

taken together, we conclude that spo <dig> is exported to the cytoplasm via the mrna export machinery, but is unlikely to be involved in global mrna export. it was recently shown that drosophila rae <dig> plays an essential role in male meiosis and spermatogenesis  <cit> . fission yeast rae <dig> may also promote meiosis by transporting mrnps from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. some rna-binding proteins are also known to be exported to the cytoplasm through binding to mrnas  <cit> . the mrna-dependent nuclear export of rna-binding proteins may emerge as a more universal phenomenon among eukaryotes than previously anticipated.

nuclear export is important for the function of spo5
the findings of this study indicated that mutations in rrms caused abnormal nuclear accumulation and loss of function of spo <dig>  this suggests that the mrna-dependent nuclear export of spo <dig> is required for its function, although it is also possible that the loss of rna-binding in spo <dig> resulted in its abnormal localization as a secondary effect. hence, we employed two approaches to investigate whether the nuclear export of spo <dig> is a fundamental requirement for its function.

first, we used an external nuclear localization signal  to alter the localization of spo <dig> artificially from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. although the addition of nls appeared to make the protein less stable , cells expressing spo5–nls–gfp accumulated the fusion proteins detectably in the nucleus, indicating that the nls sequence was functional . the sporulation efficiency of these cells was significantly reduced, and they produced abnormally shaped spores or asci with less than four spores . while the destabilization of spo5–nls was likely to contribute largely to the sporulation defect, enforced nuclear migration of spo <dig> also appeared to abolish its function to promote meiosis and sporulation, suggesting that the nuclear export of spo <dig> is important for its optimal function. the viability of the spores generated in spo5-nls-gfp cells was comparable to that of the control , implying that the loss of spo <dig> function did not affect the germination potential.

second, we investigated whether artificial nuclear export of spo <dig> could suppress sporulation defects in some spo <dig> mutants. removal of rrm <dig> caused nuclear accumulation of spo <dig> and sporulation defects, although a small portion of spo <dig> rrm1∆ cells could sporulate . the fusion of a nuclear export signal  to spo5rrm1∆  enhanced its localization to the cytoplasm . however, the sporulation efficiency was much lower than that observed for spo5–gfp carrying intact rrm <dig>  and was only comparable to that observed for spo5rrm1∆ -gfp . hence, we conclude that the rna-binding activity of spo <dig> is necessary not only for nuclear export of the spo5–mrna complex via the mrna export machinery, but also for the function of spo <dig> in the cytoplasm.

pcr1

 mrna is one of the critical targets of spo5
the spo <dig> mutant isolated in this study was unique in that it did not accumulate spo <dig> protein efficiently in the nucleus in rae1- <dig> mutant cells at the restrictive temperature , although it was produced in a comparable or slightly lower amount to the wild-type , implying that this mutant protein might be defective in nuclear import. in addition, the spo <dig> mutant was less leaky compared to the spo <dig> mutant, which sporulated almost normally at 25°c, as indicated by iodine staining  <cit>  and microscopic measurement . therefore, we screened for multi-copy suppressors of spo <dig>  expecting to identify novel candidates. we introduced the cdna library to the spo <dig> mutant and picked up iodine-positive colonies. in this screening we obtained clones encoding transcription factors. among them was the pcr1
+
 gene, which encodes an atf/creb family transcription factor. the pcr1
+
 gene was not a novel candidate, because we have previously reported the isolation of this gene as a multicopy suppressor of the spo <dig> mutant  <cit> . we and others have characterized pcr <dig>  which is now known to form a heterodimer with atf <dig> and binds to the ade6-m <dig> meiotic recombination hotspot  <cit> .

the relationship between pcr <dig> and spo <dig>  however, has not been delineated. transcription of pcr1
+
 was not lowered in the spo <dig> null mutant, spo5∆ . the levels of pcr1
+
 transcripts gradually increase toward late meiosis  <cit>  , suggesting that pcr <dig> may also function in a meiotic process other than meiotic recombination. overexpression of pcr1
+
 could suppress the sporulation deficiency of spo <dig> and other spo <dig> mutants including spo5∆ . these data suggest that pcr <dig> may act downstream of spo <dig>  and that meiotic progression can be promoted substantially without spo <dig> if pcr <dig> is expressed at sufficiently high levels.

s. pombe has four atf/creb family proteins, namely pcr <dig>  atf <dig>  atf <dig>  and atf <dig>  <cit> . although we examined all of them, only pcr <dig> could suppress sporulation defects of spo5∆ cells when overexpressed . curiously, overexpression of atf <dig>  a functional partner that forms a heterodimer with pcr <dig>  <cit> , failed to suppress spo <dig> mutants. this suggested that spo <dig> might be specifically related to pcr1
+
 gene expression, and furthermore, that pcr <dig> might promote transcription of some meiotic genes that are regulated by spo <dig>  it was also evident that spo <dig> could regulate factors other than pcr <dig> that are important for meiotic progression and sporulation, because pcr <dig> could not suppress sporulation defects of spo5∆ as efficiently as spo <dig> itself , although pcr1
+
 overexpression increased the amount of pcr1
+
 mrna in spo5∆ cells to a higher level than spo5
+
 overexpression . indeed, we have recently demonstrated that spo <dig> is necessary to maintain proper expression of cyclin cdc <dig>  <cit> .

to test the possibility that spo <dig> may bind to pcr1
+
 mrna to modulate its expression/function during meiosis, we performed an electrophoresis mobility shift assay  using recombinant spo <dig> protein and pcr1
+
 rna transcribed in vitro. as shown in figure 5a, the c-terminal part of spo <dig>  including the two rrms , fused to glutathione s-transferase  , associated with the pcr1
+
 rna , but not with the control gfp rna. to confirm direct interaction of spo <dig> and pcr1
+
 rna in vivo, we performed an rna-immunoprecipitation assay using the spo5-gfp diploid strain. immunoprecipitation by anti-gfp antibody indicated that pcr1
+
 mrna formed a complex with spo5-gfp in vivo, but that the mrnas of other atf/creb factors did not . to further confirm the specificity of binding, we compared binding of spo5c to pcr1
+
 rna and atf21
+
 rna transcribed similarly in vitro. while spo5c bound to atf21
+
 rna to some extent , probably because of its weak non-specific affinity for rna, which we noticed previously  <cit> , it was clear that spo5c could bind to pcr1
+
 rna more strongly than atf21
+
 rna, as 50 ng of the protein was enough to shift pcr1
+
 rna . we also confirmed that spo5c carrying the f341a and f427a mutations, designated spo5c, lost the binding ability to pcr1
+
 rna , demonstrating the importance of the rrms for the binding. these observations indicate that pcr1
+
 mrna is one of the critical targets of spo <dig>  we have shown that cdc13
+
 mrna also binds to spo <dig>  <cit> . a previous report suggested that a long 3′ utr of cdc13
+
, cdc25
+
 and ste9
+
 mrna might determine its stability  <cit> . the pcr1
+
 mrna also carries a relatively long 3′ untranslated region , but our observation does not support the idea that spo <dig> stabilizes pcr1
+
 mrna . thus, it is an interesting hypothesis to be confirmed that spo <dig> may control certain activity of pcr1
+
 mrna through binding to its long 3′ utr.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings of this study indicated that spo <dig> is exported to the cytoplasm via the mrna export machinery, but not via the ran–exportin/crm <dig> system. the binding of spo <dig> to mrnas through its two rrms appears to enable its nuclear export, and this rna-binding activity is essential not only for the nuclear export, but also for its function in the cytoplasm. spo <dig> is unlikely to be involved in general mrna export, suggesting that it may instead be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation occurring in the cytoplasm, such as control of mrna stability and/or translational initiation. furthermore, we identified a novel binding target of spo <dig>  pcr1+ mrna. overexpression of the pcr1+ gene suppressed the sporulation deficiency of spo <dig> mutants, demonstrating that pcr1+ mrna is a critical target of spo <dig>  however, pcr <dig> suppressed the defect in spo5∆  cells less efficiently than spo <dig>  suggesting that spo <dig> may also regulate factors important for meiotic progression and sporulation other than pcr <dig>  suppression of spo <dig> by overexpression of cdc13+ is also partial  <cit> . future studies are required to identify other important targets of spo <dig> and the possible role that spo <dig> plays in the post-transcriptional regulation of pcr1+ mrna and other mrnas.
