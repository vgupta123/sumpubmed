BACKGROUND
strong experimental evidence generated during the last decade has established that epigenetic mechanisms are both necessary and required for the development and maintenance of reproductive function  <cit> . at the mechanistic level, epigenetic regulation primarily consists of establishing, maintaining, and reversing posttranslational modifications  present on dna and histones, as well as the function of several types of both small and large non-coding rna molecules  <cit> . within a particular cell type, these epigenetic regulators function as signals that define gene expression patterns, which establish and maintain normal and diseased phenotypes. epigenetic marks are generated by a highly specialized group of proteins responsible for their deposition , interpretation , and when necessary, erasure from chromatin . the hp <dig> family of reader proteins was one of the first discovered epigenetic regulators and most versatile of the proteins that regulate chromatin-based inheritance  <cit> . there are three hp <dig> subtypes α, β, and γ, encoded in humans by cbx <dig>  cbx <dig>  and cbx <dig>  respectively  <cit> . these proteins have three domains with the n-terminal chromodomain binding to lysine  <dig> methylated histone marks, joined by a flexible linker region to a carboxy-terminal chromoshadow domain, which supports dimerization and interaction with other chromatin proteins  <cit> . hp1α and hp1β are mostly associated with transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin, whereas hp1γ is observed in both heterochromatin and transcriptionally active euchromatin  <cit> . functionally, hp <dig> proteins regulate development through their ability to determine various cellular phenotypes by regulating entire gene expression networks at the appropriate level, time, and place. hp <dig> proteins are also emerging as candidate regulators of reproductive function; however, their roles in these phenomena have just begun to be elucidated. for instance, recent studies demonstrate that genetic inactivation of hp1γ in the germ line results in adult males carrying severe spermatogenic defects and growth retardation  <cit> . interestingly, previous work in somatic cells has shown that hp1γ is phosphorylated, acetylated, ubiquitinated, sumoylated, and methylated  <cit> , though whether these posttranslational modifications have any impact on the biology of cells from reproductive organs remains to be defined. in the current study, we describe the phosphorylation, localization, and genome-wide regulatory functions of hp1γ in gonadal tissue, gametes, and the pre-implantation embryo. we demonstrate that phosphorylation of this protein at s <dig>  which occurs in response to aurora a  <cit> , is necessary for supporting proper mitotic cell division in cells from the sperm lineage. therefore, we conclude that phosphorylation of hp1γ, prior to meiosis, differentiation, and maturation, is necessary to maintain a viable pool of male gametes, extending our understanding of signaling cascades that regulate the function of this important chromatin protein in reproductive biology. since drugs that target both aurora a and the hp1γ pathway are emerging as tools for the treatment of diverse diseases including addiction and cancer, the new knowledge derived from the current study should be taken into consideration to predict potential side effects of these therapies on reproductive functions.

RESULTS
function of hp1γ phosphorylation during mitotic cell division in male germ cells
unexpectedly, phenotypic examinations in mice carrying a gene trap that disrupts the hp1γ gene, initially generated for experiments that did not seek to necessarily shed light into reproductive biology, demonstrated that alterations in this chromatin protein result in azoospermia  <cit> . however, there is a paucity of data on how this protein is regulated to support the development and maturation of the sperm lineage. recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated in somatic cells that hp1γ phosphorylation at ser <dig> is catalyzed by aurora a  <cit> , a kinase that plays a significant role in supporting proliferation throughout development  <cit> . thus, to begin filling this important knowledge gap, we initially studied the localization specifically of the ser83-phosphorylated form of hp1γ in mouse testis sections using immunohistochemistry. notably, we found that p-ser83-hp1γ localizes most strongly within cells along the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules, where mitotic spermatogonia and pre-leptotene spermatocytes reside . in order to determine whether p-ser83-hp1γ could be detected in later stages of spermatogenesis, we performed higher resolution imaging on mature sperm by electron microscopy, which revealed that this phosphorylated subpopulation of hp1γ is stored primarily in the centriole and mid-piece region at the base of the sperm nucleus . this localization was further confirmed by immunofluorescence, which clearly showed that the signal for phosphorylated hp1γ was not localized within the sperm nuclei, as shown by dapi counterstain, but rather coincided with the mid-piece . in addition, p-ser83-hp1γ colocalized with centrin- <dig>  a structural component of the centrosome, which is located within the sperm mid-piece . this localization of p-ser83-hp1γ is congruent with the fact that the kinase responsible for this modification, namely aurora a, has also been shown to be localized to centrioles  <cit> .fig.  <dig> p-s83-hp1γ is present in testicular tissue and spermatozoa. a. p-s83-hp1γ in normal mouse testicular tissue. immunohistochemistry of p-s83-hp1γ  reveals that the cell population near the basal lamina, typically undergoing high levels of proliferation, is the most highly p-s83-hp1γ positive. right panel demonstrates negative control of immunohistochemistry staining with secondary antibody only. scale bar represents 50 μm. b and c. p-s83-hp1γ localization in spermatozoa by electron microscopy. immunogold electron microscopy depicting mature human spermatozoa. p-s83-hp1γ was concentrated in the centriole  and mid-piece  of the spermatozoa. d and e. p-s83-hp1γ localization spermatozoa by immunofluorescence. representative image for protein localization of human spermatozoa with immunofluorescence. localization of p-s83-hp1γ is observed adjacent to the sperm nuclei , corresponding to the mid-piece of mature human sperm. this signal also co-localizes with centrin- <dig> , structural component of the centrosome located in the mid-piece



we subsequently asked whether the role of p-ser83-hp1γ is an exclusive feature of male cell division or it is also found in oocytes and, after fertilization, during mitosis in early embryos. interestingly, we found that m <dig> oocytes did not demonstrate localization of p-ser83-hp1γ at spindle poles . similarly, newly fertilized embryos, which do not yet exhibit pronuclear syngamy , did not display p-ser83-hp1γ localization to euchromatin as previously described in somatic cells  <cit> . however, embryos undergoing the first mitotic cell division transitioning from pronuclear syngamy  to the 2-cell stage  demonstrated localization of p-ser83-hp1γ at the spindle poles, colocalizing with γ-tubulin. this event coincides with mouse early embryonic genome activation  <cit> . this localization was maintained in mitotic cells from the first division through the late blastocyst stage. day  <dig> early blastocysts  and day  <dig> late blastocysts  also demonstrated localization of p-ser83-hp1γ to its euchromatic location . these experiments were complemented with quantitative pcr, which demonstrated that hp1γ transcript was  <dig> -fold higher  in spermatozoa and  <dig> -fold higher  in m <dig> oocytes than in the newly fertilized, pronuclear embryo  when normalized to gapdh levels . there was a  <dig> -fold increase  in hp1γ expression at the day  <dig>  pronuclear syngamy stage compared with the day  <dig> pronuclear embryo before syngamy and a  <dig> -fold increase  at the 2-cell stage . however, hp1γ expression levels decreased after this point through the early blastocyst  and late blastocyst  stages . thus, combined, these results suggest that phosphorylation of hp1γ at ser <dig> plays a key role in mitotic cell division in the male germ line and early embryonic genome activation, which is likely contributed by the sperm.fig.  <dig> spatiotemporal phosphorylation and expression of hp1γ increases during early embryonic development. a. immunofluorescence of p-s83-hp1γ in mouse oocytes and embryos. immunofluorescence depicting p-s83-hp1γ , γ tubulin  and dapi dna staining . p-s83-hp1γ colocalizes to centrosomes at the time of mouse early embryonic genome activation  and maintains this location through the remainder of mitotic divisions. after syngamy this protein then localizes to its euchromatic location during interphase in cells in the preimplantation embryo.b. hp1γ mrna expression during early embryonic development. mrna from mouse oocytes and embryos were analyzed by q-pcr. relative expression was normalized using ΔΔct for hp1γ levels to gapdh. lowest value in each analysis  was normalized as  <dig> with fold changes depicted in logarithmic units on the y-axis. error bars represent s.e.m. time course of embryos post hcg injection was day  <dig> , day  <dig>  , day  <dig> , day  <dig> , day  <dig> 



genetic inactivation of hp1γ in cultured male germ cell lines leads to mitotic aberrations
using immortalized mouse male germ cell lines , well-suited models for functional studies on the sperm lineage corresponding to the pre-meiotic spermatogenic cell population  <cit> , for which we observed the highest p-ser83-hp1γ levels, we first measured the protein levels of both hp1γ and its phosphorylated ser <dig> form by western blot. fig. 3a demonstrates that indeed these proteins can be readily detected, leading us to proceed with experiments based on the genetic inactivation of hp1γ. for this purpose, we proceeded to knockdown hp1γ using stable lentiviral shrna, which achieved an approximate 90 % reduction in protein levels as demonstrated by western blot analyses . in addition, examination of knockdown cells by immunofluorescence further confirmed decrease of hp1γ and p-ser83-hp1γ staining in cells transfected with hp1γ-specific shrna. more importantly, phenotypic examination of these cells determined that the genetic inactivation of hp1γ results in mitotic defects, which include centrosome abnormalities, multipolar spindles, and unorganized chromosomes  compared with control. quantitative analyses revealed that these abnormalities were significantly induced by hp1γ knockdown  when compared to scrambled control shrna  cells . concordantly, the shhp1γ cell population also demonstrated decreased cell division compared to shctrl cells, as measured by mitotic index assay . thus, these results demonstrate that normal levels of hp1γ are necessary to maintain normal mitotic cell division in pre-meiotic cells from the sperm lineage, a finding that is congruent with our immunohistochemical observations.fig.  <dig> knockdown of hp1γ in germ cells results in mitotic abnormalities. a. levels of p-s83-hp1γ in gc <dig> and gc <dig> cell lines. high levels of hp1γ and its phosphorylated ser <dig> form are found in the cell lines, gc <dig> and gc <dig>  by western blot. b. knockdown of hp1γ in gc <dig> cells. shrna-mediated knockdown of hp1γ results in reduction of hp1γ protein levels as shown by western blot. α-tubulin is used as loading control. c. immunofluorescence of hp1γ knockdown in gc <dig> cells. immunofluorescence of control cells  shows colocalization of p-s83-hp1γ staining in green and γ-tubulin in red, creating a yellow signal in the overlay. dna is counterstained with dapi . shrna knockdown of hp1γ abolishes p-s83-hp1γ staining  and results in centrosomal abnormalities compared with control cells. a representative shhp1γ cell is shown where centrosomes are labeled by γ-tubulin staining  to demonstrate aberrant spindle pole number and localization during mitosis. d. quantification of mitotic abnormalities. quantification reveals a significantly high rate of centrosomal abnormalities in the shhp1γ cells vs shctrl,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % respectively. e. hp1γ knockdown in gc <dig> cells results in decreased cell division. mitotic index assay confirms that shhp1γ cells have decreased cell division compared to shctrl cells , likely as a result of these mitotic abnormalities



hp1γ regulates gene expression networks that are key for supporting normal spermatogenesis
since the major biochemical function of hp1γ is to regulate gene expression, we next examined the effects of this protein on genome-wide expression profiling that may influence spermatogenesis. for this purpose, we utilized our gc <dig> cell line stably expressing an hp1γ shrna knockdown construct. when compared to control shrna cells , the genetic inactivation of hp1γ resulted in  <dig> genes being significantly upregulated or downregulated. further processing of this data using a gene ontology  anova analysis demonstrated that hp1γ knockdown significantly impacted biological processes involved in sperm development  . this relationship was apparent by the differential regulation of gene targets involved in both mitosis and meiosis-related processes such as those ontologically-related to the regulation of the cell cycle and mitosis . to validate these results, we used real time quantitative pcr to measure the expression of a subset of spermatogenesis targets identified as significant by the affymetrix analysis . these experiments sought to validate changes in the expression of genes with the following associated processes: meiosis , spermatogenesis , cell motility , response to stress , among others . complementary, ingenuity-based analysis showed that the top-scoring gene networks differentially modified by hp1γ knockdown were related to cellular development, gene expression, and cell cycle. for instance, a representative example of this type of gene networks, shown in fig. 4d, pertains to regulation of the wnt signaling pathway, which has widely been implicated in the promotion of proliferation and unipotent properties of spermatogonial stem cells  <cit> . therefore, we conclude that our genome-wide data obtained though the knockdown of hp1γ in male germ cell lines is congruent with a role for this protein in male germ cell division, as supported by both our immunochemical analyses and mechanistic cell biological experiments.fig.  <dig> knockdown of hp1γ in male germ cells impacts processes related to mitosis and meiosis. a. affymetrix whole genome gene expression analysis was performed on gc <dig> hp1γ knockdown cells compared to scrambled shrna control cells.  <dig> genes targets are significantly  activated or repressed in the absence of hp1γ. b. gene ontology  anova analysis of the  <dig> targets was performed and revealed significant  enrichment of mitosis and meiosis associated processes, as well as processes involved in differentiation. c. qpcr validation of a subset of identified knockdown targets with known function in male fertility is shown. fold change of shhp1γ compared to shctrl expression is represented on a scale of ± <dig> and shown next to the corresponding affymetrix data. d. the top-scoring ingenuity-based network analysis network is significantly  associated with cellular development, gene expression, and cell cycle



phosphorylation at ser <dig> plays a role in hp1γ-mediated regulation of spermatogenesis-associated gene expression networks
to characterize the relationship of hp1γ phosphorylation on the regulation of genes identified by hp1γ knockdown, we performed a rescue experiment by expressing wild type hp1γ or phosphorylation mutants. toward this end, we utilized our gc1-hp1γ knockdown cells and transduced them with adenoviral vectors expressing empty vector , wild type hp1γ , the non-phosphorylatable mutant , or a phosphomimetic form of ser83-hp1γ  for affymetrix whole genome gene expression analysis . genes that were not significantly regulated by wt-hp1γ, hp1γ-s83a, or hp1γ-s83d  were compared to genes significantly altered in the presence of hp1γ knockdown . rescue was a priori defined as a significant reversal in expression of the gene loci identified by hp1γ knockdown in the presence of either wild type or phospho-mutant hp1γ . of the  <dig> genes affected by hp1γ knockdown identified in the previous experiment ,  <dig> genes were not rescued by wt-hp1γ or either mutant , which suggests that their expression is not directly modulated by hp1γ or is an artifact of the gene knockdown. expression of the phosphomimetic  and the non-phosphorylatable  forms rescued  <dig> genes , indicating that a significant portion of hp1γ function in these cells is dependent on phosphorylation. notably, both mutants altered expression of a large subset of genes not identified in the knockdown rescue unique from wild type hp1γ overexpression, suggesting that mutation of the serine  <dig> site and altered phosphorylation status may possess profound pathway disruption effects. additionally,  <dig> genes were rescued by wt-hp1γ . as the serine  <dig> site on the wild type hp1γ molecule is intact, the dependency of phosphorylation on the rescue of these genes is possible but indeterminate. from these data, we conclude that the expression of a subset of spermatogenesis-associated genes identified by hp1γ knockdown requires not only the expression but also the phosphorylation of this protein for their transcriptional control.

to gain better insight into how hp1γ phosphorylation status affects spermatogenesis-associated gene networks, we performed gene enrichment ontological analysis of gene targets rescued by wt and the phosphorylation mutants . accordingly, we found that wt-hp1γ rescued genes involved in various aspects of mitosis, including spindle checkpoint, protein localization to the centrosome, centriole replication, and centrosome duplication . various processes related to morphogenesis were significantly enriched, such as meiosis, apoptosis, and cellular differentiation. processes rescued by the s83a mutant, but not the s83d mutant, included g1/s regulation, as well as processes involved in delays or arrest of mitosis, indicating a requirement for hp1γ dephosphorylation during these events . targets rescued by the s83d mutant, which were surrogates for genes which their expression requires hp1γ phosphorylation, participate in mitotic g1/s checkpoint as well as cellular differentiation . a number of signaling cascades displayed enrichment with both mutants , including wnt, ras, erk, mapk, and tnf, signifying a requirement for hp1γ phosphorylation in the regulation of gene networks that support differentiation, growth, and survival processes during spermatogenesis . taken together, these results support a role for hp1γ in cell cycle processes intrinsic to the expansion and differentiation of germ progenitor cells in a manner that is highly dependent on the ser <dig> phosphorylation status of this protein.fig.  <dig> rescue of mitosis and meiosis processes mediated by hp1γ is dependent on its phosphorylation status. a-c. gene ontology  anova analysis of rescued targets was performed and revealed significant  enrichment of mitosis and meiosis associated processes, as well as processes involved in cellular expansion and differentiation for  hp1γ,  hp1γ and hp1γ-s83a but not hp1γ-s83d or  hp1γ and hp1γ-s83d but not hp1γ-s83a. targets, rescued by the wild type protein but not one of the mutants, indicate targets explicitly dependent on hp1γ phosphorylation or dephosphorylation



discussion
this study demonstrates the importance of hp1γ and its phosphorylated ser <dig> form in gametes and early embryonic development. here, we describe for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship of hp1γ with gametes and the preimplantation embryo. p- ser83-hp1γ is present at the centriole and mid-piece of the mature spermatozoa and lacking at the spindle pole of the m <dig> oocyte. after fertilization, this protein resumes its mitotic role  <cit> , as well as its euchromatic interphase localization upon mouse early embryonic genome activation at the  <dig> to 2-cell transition. the concerted regulation of relevant gene networks further confirms the importance of hp1γ in fertility.

hp1γ and its p-ser <dig> form are localized to highly proliferating cells of the testis. hp1γ is present in both mitotic and meiotic cell populations with high levels localizing to spermatogonia and spermatocytes, whereas the p-ser <dig> form is preferentially located in mitotically active spermatogonia, indicating the importance for the modification of this protein specifically during mitotic divisions. the regulation of relevant gene networks further confirms the importance of this protein and its ser <dig> phosphorylation during spermatogenesis, as mitotic, meiotic, cellular proliferation, and cellular differentiation processes are dependent on hp1γ phosphorylation status. thus, our data provide evidence that the appropriate transmission of hp1γ-mediated epigenetic signals is necessary for normal spermatogenesis and suggest that its disruption may contribute to problems with male fertility.

using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, we also localized p- ser83-hp1γ to the midpiece of the spermatozoa, where it is highly concentrated in the centriole. although murine sperm do not contribute their centrosome during fertilization  <cit> , interestingly, studies in human intra cytoplasmic sperm injection  have demonstrated that the intact axoneme along with the sperm head carrying the genetic material are required for successful fertilization  <cit> . furthermore, embryo development with this procedure and embryos resulting from injection of dissected sperm revealed chromosomal mosaicism with lack of bipolar spindle  <cit> . therefore, it would be interesting to see what role, if any, this modified form of hp1γ and its association with the centriole plays in this process.

the current study focused primarily on the pre-meiotic spermatogenic cell population, for which we observed the highest p-ser83-hp1γ levels, by utilizing gc <dig>  a sv40-immortalized mouse type b spermatogonia cell line with characteristics of a stage between type b spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes. our previous work has shown mitotic aberrations, cells with multiple centrosomes, and irregular spindle poles in somatic cells with hp1γ knockdown  <cit> . here, we confirm these findings in the gc <dig> cell line by demonstrating a significantly elevated number of abnormal mitoses in the knockdown group when compared with control. this protein was not present at the spindle poles of m <dig> oocytes that were awaiting fertilization, indicating that this may be an important spermatogenic contribution to the developing embryo, in particular, during early genome activation.

this is the first study to demonstrate the relationship of hp1γ and its p-ser <dig> form in mouse oocytes and early embryonic development. we demonstrate that p-ser83-hp1γ is not present in the euchromatin of pronuclear embryos and does not take on a mitotic localization at the spindle poles until the first or second cell division. after this transition, p-ser83-hp1γ is found in the euchromatin of interphase nuclei. pcr of mouse oocytes and early embryos supported these findings demonstrating low transcription of hp1γ in mouse oocytes and pronuclear embryos with increased transcript levels at the 1– <dig> cell  transition. interestingly, the 1– <dig> cell mouse embryonic transition has been shown to coincide with early embryonic genome activation  <cit> , suggesting that this epigenetic regulator is immediately engaged in its role in chromatin organization, as well as subsequent cell divisions.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the results of this study provide evidence that hp1γ in sperm may contribute to early embryonic mitotic divisions that occur at the time of embryonic genome activation. furthermore, disruption of this hp1γ-aurora kinase pathway may contribute to spermatogenic as well as early embryonic cleavage abnormalities leading to infertility or early pregnancy loss.
