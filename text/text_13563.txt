BACKGROUND
traditionally, the main olfactory epithelium  of mammals was said to contain only basal cells, supporting cells, and ciliated olfactory receptor neurons  that utilize or-type receptor molecules and the canonical g-protein-coupled transduction pathway via gαolf, adenylyl cyclase iii , and camp  <cit> . however, a review of the literature suggests that this conventional view is too simplistic, e.g. microvillous orns are present in the olfactory epithelium of fishes and in the vomeronasal organ of mammals. also, microvillous cells have been reported for the moe of some mammals including humans  <cit> . a study by rowley et al. utilizing hrp tracing claimed that at least some microvillous cells project directly to the olfactory bulb  <cit> . braun and zimmermann  <cit> , utilizing ecto-5'-nucleotidase as a marker, detected microvillous cells in the moe and suggested a mechanosensory function for these elements. carr et al. reported microvillous cells in rats and concluded that these cells were non-sensory cells  <cit> . functional studies revealed that mice with a disrupted camp pathway of ciliated orns are still able to detect certain odorants and conspecific chemosignals  <cit>  suggesting the presence of non-traditional transduction mechanisms. interestingly, further studies on the transduction pathway present in the olfactory epithelium of rodents led to the conclusion that some types of transient receptor channels, e.g. trpc <dig> or trpm <dig>  are expressed in what appear to be microvillous cells in the olfactory epithelium  <cit> . kaske et al. examined various tissues containing cells that express the trpm <dig> channel and postulated that trpm <dig> is a potential marker for chemosensory cells  <cit> . lin et al.  describe cells in the main olfactory epithelium that express the transient receptor channel trpm <dig>  these cells are microvillous, but vary in size and morphology.

the goal of this study was to further examine the microvillous cells in the olfactory epithelium at the light and electron microscopic level in order to ascertain whether they meet the criteria of sensory or non-sensory cells. if these cells are sensory cells they should either project an axon to the olfactory bulb as do orns, or they should form contacts with sensory nerve fibers like the solitary chemosensory cells or other types of sensory cells . we describe several types of microvillous cells, discuss their features, and conclude that the main olfactory epithelium of mice contains multiple subtypes of microvillous cells and that trpm <dig> is not necessarily a marker for sensory cells.

methods
animals
wild-type  and trpm5-gfp mice were bred in the animal facilities of the university of colorado denver, medical school. trpm5-gfp mice  contain a trpm5-gfp construct including  <dig> kb of mouse trpm <dig> 5' flanking sequence, trpm <dig> exon  <dig> , intron  <dig>  and the untranslated part of exon  <dig>  and egfp  <cit> . we used the polymerase chain reaction  to genotype the offspring for the presence of gfp. animals were  <dig> to  <dig> months old. all procedures were in compliance with the university of colorado animal care and use committee.

light microscopy
mice were anesthetized with 20% chloral hydrate , perfused transcardially with  <dig> % saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in  <dig>  m phosphate buffer . the olfactory organs were dissected and postfixed in the same fixative for  <dig> min to overnight. cryoprotection was carried out in 30% sucrose overnight. cryosections  were mounted on superfrost plus slides  and frozen at -80°c until further use. standard immunocytochemical procedures were used. briefly, cryosections were rinsed in  <dig>  m phosphate buffered saline , blocked in blocking solution containing 1% bsa, 3% normal donkey serum, and  <dig> % triton x- <dig> in pbs for  <dig> hours, and then incubated in the primary antisera overnight to  <dig> days. for details of antibodies see table  <dig>  after  <dig> washes,  <dig> min each, the sections were incubated in the appropriate secondary antibodies  for  <dig> hours at room temperature. after incubation, sections were washed  <dig> times  <dig> min and coverslipped with fluormount-g . control slides were treated either without the primary antibody or it was substituted by normal rabbit serum. where available, the antisera were adsorbed with the appropriate peptides. control sections showed no labeling. sections were viewed under a fluorescence microscope or a confocal laser microscope .

dii tracing
wild-type and trpm5-gfp mice were perfused as described above. the heads were collected and fixed in 4% pfa overnight. then the skull above the olfactory bulbs was opened. a small crystal of dii  was placed into each olfactory bulb close to the cribriform plate by means of an insect pin. the skull was closed with a layer of 2% agar. then the heads were placed in 4% pfa at room temperature for  <dig> to  <dig> weeks. after incubation the olfactory organs were dissected and embedded in 15% gelatin .  <dig> to  <dig> micron sections were cut on a vibratome  and viewed under a fluorescence microscope or a confocal laser microscope . the dii had traveled into all areas of the olfactory epithelium.

transmission electron microscopy
wild-type mice: mice were anesthetized and perfused with saline as before but the fixative was 4% glutaraldehyde in  <dig>  m phosphate buffer. the olfactory organs were dissected and postfixed in the same fixative overnight. after rinsing in phosphate buffer, the tissue samples were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for  <dig> h. the fixed specimens were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and acetone and embedded in epon-araldite . ultrathin sections  were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a fei tecnai g <dig> electron microscope .

transgenic mice: for immunolabeling at the electron microscopic level, the animals were perfused, cryoprotected and processed as described for light microscopy with the following exceptions:  <dig> to  <dig> micron floating sections were cut and collected in  <dig>  m pbs and treated with 3% h2o <dig> for  <dig> min. triton x- <dig> was replaced with 1% saponin. incubation times were extended to  <dig> days for primary antibodies and overnight for secondary antibodies. secondary antibodies were biotinylated and visualized with standard abc/dab methods. after the dab reaction the sections were washed in pb and postfixed in 4% glutaraldehyde overnight followed by a rinse in pb and postfixation in 1% osmium tetroxide for  <dig> h. then the sections were treated as described for electron microscopy of wild-type mice and embedded between two aclar sheets . some of the ultrathin sections were viewed without uranyl acetate and lead citrate staining.

RESULTS
in transgenic mice where the trpm <dig> promoter drives the expression of green fluorescent protein , gfp-positive cells are scattered throughout the main olfactory epithelium . lin et al.  <cit>  focused on the trpm5-positive orn population whereas the current paper and a companion paper  examine non-orn cell types.

even at the light microscopic level, several morphological types of gfp-positive cells are obvious. the typical morphology of orns is evident in specimens backfilled with dii from the cribriform plate. the orns are long slender bipolar cells with a thin dendrite bearing an olfactory knob with laterally radiating cilia . at the base of the orn, an axon tapers towards the basal lamina  and aggregates with other orn axons to form olfactory nerve fascicles. these fascicles penetrate the basal lamina and form the fila olfactoria. the majority of these trpm5-gfp-positive orns lie in the ventrolateral zone of the moe. only a few, faint trpm5-gfp-positive orns were present in other areas.

non-orn type gfp-positive cells are scattered throughout the main olfactory epithelium without an obvious pattern . these cells reach the surface of the epithelium but are shorter than ciliated orns; some span about half of the height of the oe, others span only the uppermost third . the upper portion of these cells is usually thicker than the dendrites of the typical ciliated orns. the apical appendages of these trpm5-gfp-positive cells are shorter than the cilia of regular orns. the trpm5-gfp label of these shorter cells is much brighter than that of the orns.

since the light microscopic level does not allow for detailed description of cell features we processed wild-type and trpm5-gfp mouse oe for electron microscopy. these experiments revealed multiple microvillous cell types. as a preliminary classification we call these microvillous cells trpm5a type, trpm5b type, and a non-trpm <dig> type on the basis of gfp-experiments and ultrastructural features. all  <dig> cell types occur in the main olfactory epithelium between ciliated orns and supporting cells . the nuclei of the  <dig> microvillous cell types show a checkerboard pattern that typically has been used to distinguish orn nuclei from the more homogenous nuclei of the supporting cells . in none of the  <dig> cell types described here did serial ultrathin sections reveal an axon penetrating the basal lamina. as our immunohistochemical experiments reveal , the population of non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells consists most likely of several subsets with different molecular features, and it is possible that one or more of these subpopulations might have an axon that escaped our detection.

trpm5a type microvillous cell
the trpm5a type microvillous cell is a medium-sized microvillous cell spanning half of the height of the olfactory epithelium  . the main difference compared to the other types of microvillous cells as seen in the electron microscope are the microvilli. trpm5a type cell microvilli radiate straight from the cell apex giving the impression of being stiff . the apex of the cell is slightly elevated but does not form a knob as in microvillous olfactory receptor cells of fish. the microvilli are  <dig> –  <dig> nm wide,  <dig>  –  <dig>  micrometer long , i.e. thicker than those of supporting cells but almost as long . the cell body contains abundant free ribosomes, some coated vesicles and some filaments, especially in the upper portion of the cell. mitochondria are longitudinally arranged and more electron-lucent than those of non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells and supporting cells. the filaments of the terminal web of the supporting cells contact trpm5a type microvillous cells but do not continue within the cell . beneath the junctional complex spines reach out and often "dig" into adjoining supporting cells . centrioles – typical for microvillous olfactory receptor cells are rare. the base of the trpm5a type microvillous cell tapers out as seen in many non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells. in the trpm5-gfp-transgenic mouse immunolabeling for gfp confirms expression in trpm5a type microvillous cells implying that they normally express the trpm <dig> channel .

trpm5b type microvillous cells
trpm5b type microvillous cells only span the upper third of the olfactory epithelium and the length of their cell bodies ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> micrometer . their cell bodies are pear-shaped and the lower half of the cell is filled with the nucleus. with  <dig> –  <dig> nm, the width of the microvilli of this cell type lies between those of trpm5a type and non-trpm <dig> type cells. their length  is similar to the length of non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells and the shape of the microvilli is also similar to that of non-trpm <dig> type cells, i.e. they do not give the impression of being stiff as seen in trpm5a type microvillous cells. the apex is flat and not elevated as in trpm5a type microvillous cells . occasionally, the upper cell body contains multivesicular bodies and/or centrioles . these centrioles are not connected to rootlets as seen in some non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells. mitochondria are more electron-lucent and shorter than in trpm5a type microvillous cells. free ribosomes are less abundant. the basal part of trpm5b type cells reveals several small filopodia-like appendages that often interdigitate with protrusions of neighboring cells . in transgenic trpm5-gfp mice, trpm5b type microvillous cells are gfp-positive indicating that they express the trpm <dig> channel as do trpm5a type microvillous cells .

non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells
the cell bodies of non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells have about the same length as those of trpm5a type cells  . the small microvilli occasionally branch . the width of these microvilli ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> nm, their length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  micrometer. thus, they are thicker but shorter than the microvilli of supporting cells . the microvilli sprout from a small knob that is more pronounced than in trpm5a type microvillous cells. occasionally one or more centrioles are present in the upper part of the cell beneath the zonula occludens. small rootlets may or may not be attached to these centrioles . centrioles and rootlets are not present in all microvillous cells and the range of width and length of the microvilli is larger than in trpm5a type and trpm5b microvillous cells. therefore it is possible that the cells described here as non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells represent more than one cell population . the neighboring supporting cells contain a dense terminal web which contacts the microvillous cells. contrary to the situation in trpm5a type and trpm5b microvillous cells , some filaments of the terminal web are also present in some non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cell . the apical knob and the cell body contain few light vesicles and coated vesicles. the cell body contains several golgi apparati, free ribosomes, and bundles of electron-dense filaments. the mitochondria are electron-dense  whereas the mitochondria in trpm5a type and trpm5b cells are electron-lucent . the nuclei are located at the level of the nuclei of supporting cells, sometimes even higher. the height of the cell from apex to the base where it tapers out is about  <dig> micrometer. occasionally, non-trpm <dig> type cells are in close contact with nerve fibers. sometimes the cell "wraps" around these fibers . however, we did not detect obvious synapses. this microvillous cell type does not express gfp in the transgenic trpm5-gfp mouse .

to directly test the possibility that these  <dig> cell types might have an axon, the fluorescent tracer dii was placed into the olfactory bulb close to the cribriform plate. in trpm5-gfp mice the green fluorescence was lost due to the long incubation in the fixative so that clear double-labeling with dii was not possible. dii traveled well into the oe, labeling the typical long slender orns. only rarely was a medium-sized cell spanning the upper half of the epithelium labeled with dii . cells that span only the upper third of the epithelium, i.e. where the trpm5a and trpm5b microvillous cells are, were not labeled with dii.

given the fact that we could not detect an axon penetrating the basal lamina in either electron microscopic or dii preparations, we conducted numerous immunohistochemical experiments to substantiate the notion that at least some of these microvillous cells are non-olfactory if not non-sensory cells. we utilized a panel of markers for various cell features . our experiments show that multiple subsets of trpm5-gfp-negative microvillous cells exist. for the time being we classify these as non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells. experiments to further distinguish the cell types classified here as non-trpm <dig> type cells are underway.

in order to test whether the microvillous cells are innervated by trigeminal nerve fibers  <cit> , we used antisera against cgrp and substance p, markers for trigeminal innervation. nerve fibers expressing cgrp or substance p were labeled within and below the olfactory epithelium  but we did not see any contact with the trpm5-gfp-positive microvillous cells. however, it is possible that non-trpm <dig> type cells are in contact with nerve fibers since we found microvillous cells at the electron microscopic level that are adjacent to nerve fibers . since the trpm5-gfp cell bodies lie in the layer of the nuclei of the supporting cells, we tested the sus- <dig> antibodies known to label supporting cells in the main olfactory epithelium  <cit> . trpm5-gfp cells did not express sus- <dig>  although surrounding supporting cells do.

despite the fact that trpm5a type and trpm5b type microvillous cells clearly differ in morphology, their expression pattern of cell markers was identical . both types were labeled with espin and villin, markers for microvilli . in addition to the trpm5-gfp-positive microvillous cells, some trpm5-gfp-negative cells of microvillous morphology also were labeled with espin suggesting that these cells belong to the non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cell group .

to test whether the microvillous cells in question are olfactory neurons we applied omp, pgp  <dig>  and hu-d, antisera that label ciliated orns. neither trpm5a type nor trpm5b microvillous cells expressed omp or pgp  <dig>  , or hu-d  underlining their non-olfactory/non-neuronal character. in order to uncover possible features of these microvillous cells, we tested various antibodies against members of transduction pathways , trpc <dig> , gαolf, gαq/ <dig> , pde2a ), synaptic components  and other common cell markers . other than espin and villin none of the cell markers used in this study labeled the trpm5-gfp cells categorized as trpm5a type and trpm5b microvillous cells. however, several of these markers were expressed in cells with microvillous morphology  that were trpm5-gfp-negative. these cells probably belong to the non-trpm <dig> type group of microvillous cells and are presently investigated in a separate study.

discussion
our study revealed at least  <dig> types of microvillous cells in the main olfactory epithelium of mice. villin and espin, actin-binding proteins typically expressed in microvilli of chemosensory and mechanosensory systems  <cit>  were the only cell markers that labeled all microvillous cell types, confirming that they all bear microvilli. two of the microvillous cell types show the transient receptor channel trpm5-gfp label . in addition, electron microscopic as well as immunohistochemical experiments revealed microvillous cells that were trpm5-gfp-negative and expressed other cell markers not seen in the trpm5-gfp cells. we group these cells as non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells. none of the types of microvillous cells described in this study have an axon that penetrates the basal lamina nor did we detect synapses consistent with findings from other studies.

kaske et al. studied cells in various tissues that expressed trpm <dig> and postulated that trpm <dig> is an intrinsic signaling component that plays a physiological role in olfaction of odorants and pheromones  <cit> . as trpm <dig> is also present in cells of the taste and gastrointestinal system the authors claim that trpm <dig> is a marker for chemosensory cells. lin et al. also found solitary chemosensory cells in the respiratory epithelium that are trpm5-positive  <cit> . if trpm <dig> is a marker for chemosensory cells, the trpm5-positive cells should express other characteristics of chemosensory cells including contact with the nervous system as well as members of the chemosensory transduction pathway, and/or other markers of orns like omp, pgp  <dig>  etc. in the case of the solitary chemosensory cells, lin et al. showed that trpm5-positive cells are also labeled by antisera against plcβ <dig> and pgp  <dig> , known markers for chemosensory cells  <cit> . yet, none of these components double-labeled the microvillous trpm5-gfp-positive cells in our study. also, the antibody sus- <dig> which is specific for olfactory supporting cells did not label the trpm5-positive cells. thus, based on the present study, we conclude that the trpm5-gfp-positive cells – termed here trpm5a type and trpm5b type microvillous cells – are not among the cells traditionally described as comprising the olfactory epithelium, i.e. olfactory receptor cells, supporting cells, and basal cells. since none of the neuronal cell markers tested showed a positive result, and the cells have neither an axon projecting to the olfactory bulb nor contact to nerve fibers of trigeminal origin, it is not even clear whether these cells are sensory cells at all. at least for chemosensory cells we question the reliability of trpm <dig> as a marker. however, we do not rule out that the trpm5-gfp-positive microvillous cells may be chemoresponsive and influence local mucosal elements through the release of diffusible mediators.

a recent study on mouse and rat olfactory epithelium described microvillous cells labeled with antibodies against ip3r <dig> and plcβ <dig>  <cit> . these microvillous cells did not degenerate after bulbectomy suggesting that they are not orns. the authors claimed that these cells express the transient receptor channel trpc <dig> although they did not show double-label experiments for trpc <dig> and either ip3r <dig> or plcβ <dig>  in the present study we did not see any cells double-labeled for trpm <dig> and trpc <dig>  neither did the trpm5-gfp-positive cells double-label for ip3r <dig> or plcβ <dig> . consequently, we postulate that the trpm5-gfp-positive microvillous cells are not the ones shown in the study by elsaesser  <cit> . it is likely that the trpc <dig> cells belong to the group of non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells.

in the past, several studies mentioned microvillous cells in the main olfactory epithelium of rodents, e.g.  <cit> . since the morphological descriptions varied and the proposed functions were often controversial, these studies received little attention. okano et al.  <cit>  postulated that microvillous cells in the olfactory epithelium of dogs were precursors of supporting cells. bannister  <cit> , based on the electron microscopic descriptions of the chicken olfactory epithelium  <cit> , suggested that microvillous cells may be precursors for ciliated olfactory neurons. this hypothesis was rejected by jourdan  <cit>  since both cell types have very distinct features and no "intermediate" stages between microvillous and ciliated olfactory neurons have ever been detected.

others have attributed various functions to these microvillous cells in addition to the notion of being precursor cells. one central question was: are the microvillous cells true orns? rowley and coworkers conducted experiments with hrp as a neural tracer and showed that microvillous cells could be retrogradely labeled from the rat olfactory bulb  <cit> . the authors mentioned, however, that a small percentage of microvillous cells "did not effectively transport hrp" from the olfactory bulb to their somata. there is also the possibility of nonspecific labeling. a study on the oe of fish reported a third type of orn labeled by fluorogold  <cit> . later it was shown that the fluorogold labeled cells in the oe nonspecifically  <cit> . in the present study we did not find any evidence of an axon projecting towards the olfactory bulb which would have been proof that these microvillous cells are, indeed, orns. although we cannot rule out completely that we may have missed cells with an axon in our ultrathin  serial sections, we conclude that the microvillous cells described in this study are not orns.

several authors reported microvillous cells without an axon, i.e. cells that were not orns. for instance, carr et al.  <cit>  described a microvillous cell in the rat olfactory epithelium. these cells had no axon and survived ablation of the olfactory bulb but did not react with the marker for supporting cells sus- <dig>  thus these cells do not belong to the olfactory system in the strict sense of basal, supporting, and olfactory receptor cells.

occasionally the morphological features of microvillous cells reported in the past are similar to the features seen in microvillous cells of this study. miller and coworkers described microvillous cells in the rat olfactory epithelium in a study of regeneration following exposure to toxic compounds  <cit> . these cells had no synapses but finger-like processes extending between the supporting cells. also, histochemical staining with ecto-5'-nucleotidase revealed microvillous cells in the rat olfactory epithelium that had numerous invaginations interdigitating with the cell membranes of neighboring supporting cells  <cit> . we noted numerous processes of trpm5b and non-trpm <dig> type microvillous cells interdigitating with other cells, and also invaginations in non-trpm <dig> microvillous cells. asan and drenckhahn  <cit>  described two types of microvillous cells in rat and mouse. among others, the authors showed microvillous cells labeled with antibodies against villin and ck  <dig>  in the present study we detected villin in trpm5a, trpm5b and non-trpm <dig> microvillous cells whereas ck  <dig> labeled only non-trpm <dig> microvillous cells. it is probable that some of the microvillous cells seen in this study may be the microvillous cells described by  <cit> , or  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that the mouse olfactory epithelium contains different types of microvillous cells. the cell types described in this study do not have an axon, i.e. are not orns. the broad reaction spectrum to various cell markers seen in this study and in the literature implies the existence of several subpopulations of microvillous cells. their function is enigmatic. further experiments are needed to elucidate the role of these cell populations and their possible connection to the olfactory and/or other sensory systems.
