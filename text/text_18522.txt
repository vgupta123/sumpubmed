BACKGROUND
prl- <dig>  a non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase containing a caax motif for prenylation at the carboxyl terminus
 <cit> , was found to be up-regulated in various types of malignancy, including colorectal, gastric, ovarian and breast cancers
 <cit> . it has been shown to play a causal role in tumor metastasis by enhancing cancer cell motility and in tumor angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial cells
 <cit> . prl- <dig> expression is correlated with disease progression and poor survival
 <cit> , and its antibody was shown to dramatically inhibit metastatic tumor formation in human ovarian cancer cells
 <cit> , therefore it had been deemed as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer
 <cit> .

prl- <dig> could down-regulate pten expression and activate the pi3k pathway to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition , thus contributing to tumor metastasis
 <cit> . it has been implicated in controlling integrin-src signaling pathway, in which ectopic prl- <dig> promoted src activation and potentiated src-modulated oncogenic pathways, including erk1/ <dig>  stat <dig>  and p130cas
 <cit> . prl- <dig> was also shown to be a negative regulator of tumor suppressor p53
 <cit> . as a phosphatase, few prl- <dig> substrates had been characterized, including ezrin
 <cit>  and cytokeratin 8
 <cit> , however, the cellular substrates of prl- <dig> remain largely unknown.

integrins are a large family of trans-membrane proteins, which are broadly involved in regulation of cell adhesion, motility and other physical and pathological processes
 <cit> . engagement of intergrins with their ligands stimulates diverse intracellular signaling pathways, such as tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases
 <cit> . integrin α <dig> and β <dig> are known to heterodimerize to form the receptor for extracellular matrix , which is prerequisite for downstream signaling
 <cit> . we previously identified integrin α <dig> as an interacting protein of prl- <dig> through yeast two-hybrid screening, and prl- <dig> could down-regulate the tyrosine-phosphorylation level of integrin β1
 <cit> . furthermore, we showed the critical role of integrin β1-erk1/2-mmp <dig> signaling in prl-3-promoted motility, invasion, and metastasis of colon cancer cells
 <cit> . in this study, we demonstrate that prl- <dig> directly binds to integrin β <dig> and dephosphorylates integrin β1-y <dig>  a key residue for integrin β <dig> function
 <cit> . moreover, we show that integrin α <dig> inhibits the prl-3/integrin β <dig> interaction and the dephosphorylation of integrin β1-y <dig> by prl- <dig> 

RESULTS
direct interaction between prl- <dig> and integrin β <dig>  which is regulated by integrin α1
our previous findings of integrin α <dig> as a binding partner of prl-3
 <cit>  and integrin β1-erk1/2-mmp <dig> signaling mediating prl-3-promoted cell invasion and metastasis
 <cit>  prompted us to further dissect the relationship between prl- <dig> and integrins. as an initial step, we examined their expression levels in human gastric cancer cell line bgc <dig> and colon cancer cell lines sw <dig>  lovo, and hct <dig>  figure 
1a shows that integrin β <dig> was expressed in all these cell lines, but integrin α <dig> was only detected in bgc <dig> cells. in addition, relatively high expression of prl- <dig> was found in bgc <dig> and sw <dig> cells . next, co-immunoprecititation assay was performed with protein lysates from bgc <dig> cells and sw <dig> cells. in both cell lines, endogenous integrin β <dig> was detected in anti-prl- <dig> precipitates . furthermore, gst pull-down assay was performed with bacterially expressed his-tagged prl- <dig> and gst-fused intracellular domain of integrin β <dig> . the result shows that his-prl- <dig> could be precipitated by gst-intergrin β <dig>  but not by gst . thus, prl- <dig> directly interacts with integrin β <dig> 

since integrin α <dig> heterodimerizes with integrin β1
 <cit>  and our previous study revealed an integrin α1-prl- <dig> interaction
 <cit> , we then investigated whether integrin α <dig> plays a role in modulating prl-3-integrin β <dig> interaction. we transfected integrin α1-specific sirna or control sirna into integrin α1-proficient bgc <dig> cells, and performed co-immunoprecipitation assay. as shown in figure 
2a, more integrin β <dig> was precipitated by anti-prl- <dig> antibody upon integrin α1-silencing. in addition, we carried out immunoflorescence assay to examine the co-localization between gfp-prl- <dig> and endogenous integrin β <dig>  gfp-prl- <dig> and integrin β <dig> partially co-localized on the punctate structures of cell membrane in control sirna-transfected cells. however, knockdown of integrin α <dig> resulted in an increase in the co-localization between gfp-prl- <dig> and integrin β <dig> . these findings suggest that integrin α <dig> negatively regulates association between prl- <dig> and integrin β <dig> 

in vitro and in vivo dephosphorylation of integrin β <dig> by prl-3
since prl- <dig> directly interacts with integrin β <dig>  we further investigated if integrin β <dig> is a substrate of prl- <dig> phosphatase. we expressed and purified gst-fused wild-type prl- <dig> and the prl-3-mt, in which the phosphatase activity was eliminated by mutating cystine  <dig> to serine
 <cit>  . in vitro dephosphorylation assay was performed with gst-prl- <dig> and gst-prl-3-mt plus equal amount of immunoprecipitated endogenous integrin β <dig> as substrate. we found wild-type gst-prl- <dig> significantly decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin β <dig>  whereas mutant gst-prl- <dig> had no obvious effect .

moreover, we examined if such regulation occurs in vivo. we introduced myc-prl- <dig> into bgc <dig> and hct <dig> cells. as controls, the cells were transfected with vector alone. immunoblot analysis revealed that ectopic expression of myc-prl- <dig> considerably decreased the phosphorylation of integrin β <dig> at tyrosine residue, but did not affect total protein levels of integrin β <dig> . these results indicate that prl- <dig> dephosphorylates integrin β <dig> in vitro and in vivo.

prl- <dig> dephosphorylates tyrosine- <dig> of integrin β1
previous study reported that phosphorylation of y <dig> and/or y <dig> in the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β <dig> may be essential for its function
 <cit> . we next investigated whether prl- <dig> dephsohorylates y <dig> and/or y <dig>  bgc <dig> cells and sw <dig> cells were transfected with myc-tagged wild-type prl- <dig> and prl-3-mt. immunoblot analysis revealed that ectopic expression of prl- <dig>  but not prl-3-mt, significantly reduced py <dig> of integrin β <dig> in both cell lines , while py <dig> were undetectable . we also knocked down endogenous prl- <dig> and found that depletion of prl- <dig> could markedly increase py <dig> levels in bgc <dig> cells . to further validate prl-3-mediated dephosphorylation of y <dig> of integrin β <dig>  chemical inhibitor of prl- <dig> , which has been shown to specifically inhibit prl- <dig> phosphatase activity and decrease prl-3-mediated cancer cell migration and invasion
 <cit> , was used to treat bgc <dig> and sw <dig> cells. increment of py <dig> levels in both cell lines was observed after p <dig> treatment . p <dig> had a marginal stimulatory effect on py <dig> in bgc <dig> cells, but py <dig> could be strongly enhanced by treatment with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate in both bgc <dig> and sw <dig> cells . in line with enhanced prl-3-integrin β <dig> interaction upon silencing of integrin α <dig> , py <dig> was decreased by ablation of integrin α <dig> . collectively, these results show that prl- <dig> dephosphorylates integrin β <dig> at tyrosine- <dig>  but not tyrosine- <dig> 

discussion
protein kinases and phosphatases play important roles in diverse physiological processes and diseases
 <cit> . prl- <dig>  as a member of protein phosphatases, has been found to promote cancer cell invasiveness
 <cit> . however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. in the present study, we demonstrate that prl- <dig> directly binds to integrin β <dig> and dephosphorylates integrin β1-y <dig>  furthermore, we found that deletion of integrin α <dig> resulted in increased prl-3-integrin β <dig> association and decreased phosphorylation of integrin β1-y <dig>  these findings indicate that integrin β <dig> is a bona fide substrate of prl- <dig> and raise the possibility that integrin α <dig> may function as a negative regulator for prl-3-integrin β <dig> interaction.

previous studies have shown that integrin β1-y <dig> and -y <dig> are parts of conserved npxy motifs essential for recruiting talin and kindlin, which in turn facilitates coupling of integrin β <dig> to the actin cytoskeleton and maintains integrins in an active signaling state
 <cit> . it was reported that v-src could phosphorylate integrin β <dig> tails on y <dig> and y795
 <cit> , and that phosphorylated y <dig> and y <dig> could block talin and kindlin’s binding with integrin β <dig>  respectively
 <cit> . these were supported by the study that v-src expression in fibroblasts decreases integrin β1–dependent adhesion, focal adhesion formation, cytoskeletal organization, fibronectin assembly, migration, and chemotaxis
 <cit> . while several kinases, including src, have been shown to phosphorylate y <dig> and y795
 <cit> , the phosphatase catalyzing the de-phosphorylation of these two sites is unknown. by showing prl- <dig> is responsible for dephosphorylating py <dig>  our present results provide an explanation for the delicate control of integrin β <dig> 

it is noted that a recent study showing the short phosphotyrosine peptides encompassing y <dig> or y <dig> of integrin β <dig> could not be dephosphorylated by prl- <dig> in an in vitro assay
 <cit> . however, as the author suggested, this could be explained by lack of entire integrin β <dig> to be recognized by prl-3
 <cit> . in our study, instead of using the synthesized peptides, we immunoprecipited the endogenous integrin β <dig> as substrate for in vitro phosphatase assay, which ensures optimal phosphatase-substrate association. in addition, we did not find alteration in py <dig> by over-expression or ablation of prl- <dig>  which could be due to the fact that py <dig> level is too low to be detected in the cancer cells examined. we did observe slightly more py <dig> in prl- <dig> inhibitor treated bgc <dig> cells, while such agent-induced changes of py <dig> was not as robust as those of py <dig> in bgc <dig> and sw <dig> cells. interestingly, treatment with a pan-phosphatase inhibitor significantly elevates py <dig>  suggesting that prl- <dig> may partially contribute to the dephosphorylation of py <dig> and py <dig> is mainly regulated by other phosphatase.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results demonstrated a direct interaction between prl- <dig> and integrin β <dig>  which could be negatively regulated by integrin α <dig>  importantly, we identified tyrosine  <dig> of integrin β <dig> as a direct dephosphorylation site by prl- <dig>  thus uncovering the first tyrosine phosphorylation site to be regulated by prl- <dig> phosphatase.
