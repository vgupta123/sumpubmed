BACKGROUND
bacterial genomes usually contain a significant portion of open reading frames  that encode lipoproteins. for example, the genome of neisseria meningitidis group b strain mc <dig> has  <dig> orfs that encode surface-exposed or exported putative lipoproteins  <cit> . approximately 8% of the orfs of borrelia burgdorferi encode putative lipoproteins  <cit> . the presence of numerous lipoproteins in bacterial genomes suggests their importance for bacterial survival and pathogenesis. lipoproteins have been demonstrated to have roles in preserving membrane structure, functioning as enzymes, and serving as transporters or toxins. lipoproteins also serve as immunogens; for example, the lipoprotein outer surface protein a , which plays important roles in b. burgdorferi’s biology, was used to develop an ospa-based vaccine  <cit> .

haemophilus ducreyi, the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease chancroid, has the capacity to express  <dig> putative lipoproteins , only four of which have been well characterized: the peptidoglycan associated lipoprotein , the fibrinogen binding protein , the ducreyi lectin a , and h. ducreyi lipoprotein   <cit> . pal is conserved among h. ducreyi strains and contains a surface-exposed epitope defined by the monoclonal antibody 3b <dig>  <cit> . an isogenic pal mutant is unable to cause pustules in the human infection model  <cit> . fgba and dlta also contribute to h. ducreyi virulence in humans  <cit> . the roles of other lipoproteins in h. ducreyi pathogenesis have not yet been delineated.

in order to better understand the bacterial factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of h. ducreyi, an experimental human model of infection was developed  <cit> . in this model, adult volunteers are inoculated with h. ducreyi strain 35000hp, or its isogenic derivatives, on the skin overlying the upper deltoid. within 24 h of inoculation, volunteers develop papules that either resolve or progress into pustules over the ensuing 2 weeks. experimental infection mimics natural infection both clinically and histologically and has allowed identification of h. ducreyi genes that are expressed in vivo  <cit> . one of the genes identified as being expressed in multiple volunteers was hd <dig>  hd <dig> encodes a putative lipoprotein, designated outer membrane protein p <dig> .

ompp <dig> is a homolog of the outer membrane lipoprotein e  of h. influenzae. e  is broadly conserved among typeable and nontypeable h. influenzae  strains and is expressed as an abundant, immunodominant 28 kda lipoprotein in outer membrane protein  fractions  <cit> . e  was shown to play a role in virulence in an infant rat model of infection with h. influenzae type b  <cit> . mechanistically, e  is a phosphomonoesterase that facilitates the transport of two essential nutrients, heme and nicotinamide nucleotides, across the outer membrane of nthi  <cit> . monoclonal anti-e  antibodies are highly reactive with a surface exposed epitope of e , and anti-e  serum is bactericidal against nthi strains  <cit> . immunization with e  afforded protection against colonization in a mouse model of nthi infection  <cit> . thus, e  is being actively investigated as a vaccine candidate against nthi  <cit> .

the predicted h. ducreyi ompp <dig> shares 61% identity with e , including conservation of the functional motifs required for enzymatic activity and for heme binding in e   <cit> . because of its significant homology with e  and its in vivo expression, we hypothesized that h. ducreyi ompp <dig> may play an important role during human infection. here, we found that ompp <dig> is conserved among clinical isolates of h. ducreyi. to investigate its role in virulence and its utility as a vaccine candidate for h. ducreyi, we constructed and tested an isogenic ompp <dig> mutant in h. ducreyi 35000hp for virulence in human volunteers. we also tested whether mouse serum elicited against h. ducreyi ompp <dig> promoted complement-mediated bactericidal activity or phagocytic uptake.

RESULTS
identification of the ompp <dig> gene
analysis of the 35000hp genome identified an 831 bp open reading frame  that encoded an ompp <dig> homologue. sequence analysis of ompp <dig> demonstrated an n-terminal signal ii peptide and a consensus lipidation sequence, n-vlsgc-c . based on sorting signals described for escherichia coli, the presence of a tyrosine at position  <dig> suggests that ompp <dig> sorts to the outer membrane  <cit> . the ompp <dig> orf lies within a putative operon . pcr amplification of the orf of ompp <dig> demonstrated that the gene was conserved in size and location among  <dig> different strains of h. ducreyi . amplicons from two class i and two class ii strains were sequenced and the deduced ompp <dig> sequences compared. the deduced amino acid sequences and lengths of the orfs were conserved within each class but differed by  <dig> amino acids between class i and class ii strains .

construction and characterization of an ompp <dig> mutant
we constructed and characterized an isogenic ompp <dig> mutant of h. ducreyi 35000hp, which was designated 35000hpompp <dig>  pcr amplification of the ompp <dig> orf in 35000hpompp <dig> demonstrated the size shift from 859 bp to  <dig>  kb expected by addition of the 840 bp kan cassette . in southern blotting, the kan probe did not bind to the 35000hp genome but did bind to an  <dig> -kb dna fragment of the mutant genome, as expected. the ompp <dig> probe bound to a  <dig> -kb dna fragment of the 35000hp genome and to an  <dig> -kb fragment of the 35000hpompp <dig> genome . thus, the results from the pcr and southern blot analyses were consistent with the insertion of a single antibiotic resistance cassette in the appropriate locus for the 35000hpompp <dig> mutant.

sarkosyl insoluble membrane fractions were prepared from 35000hpompp <dig> and 35000hp. the fractions obtained from 35000hpompp <dig> were similar to those of 35000hp, except for lack of expression of a 30 kda band , the predicted size of ompp <dig>  these data suggest that ompp <dig> does sort to the outer membrane  <cit> . 35000hpompp <dig> and 35000hp demonstrated similar lipooligosaccharide  profiles as analyzed by sds-page . 35000hpompp <dig> and 35000hp demonstrated identical growth rates in broth .

role of ompp <dig> in experimental human infection
eight healthy adults  volunteered for the study. one subject withdrew prior to inoculation. two subjects  were inoculated in the first iteration, two subjects  in the second iteration, and three subjects  in the third iteration. an escalating dose–response study was used to compare the virulence of the mutant and the parent. in the first iteration, each subject was inoculated with a fixed estimated delivered dose   of 35000hp at three sites on one arm and varying edds  of 35000hpompp <dig> on the other arm . pustules formed at  <dig> of  <dig> parent sites and  <dig> of  <dig> mutant sites. because the mutant was able to form pustules at doses similar to the parent, a second iteration using similar doses of parent and mutant was performed per protocol:  <dig> volunteers were inoculated with fixed edd  of 35000hp on one arm and varying edd  of 35000hpompp <dig> on the other arm. pustules formed at  <dig> of  <dig> parent sites and  <dig> of  <dig> mutant sites . after two iterations, pustules formed at  <dig> of  <dig> parent sites and  <dig> of  <dig> mutant sites, suggesting that the mutant could be more virulent than the parent. as per protocol, an interim analysis was performed in order to determine the number of sites that needed to be inoculated with the mutant and the parent to have sufficient power to detect a difference in the pustule formation rate should 35000hpompp <dig> be more virulent than 35000hp. in the third iteration,  <dig> volunteers were inoculated with a parent dose  comparable to that of the mutant ; pustules formed at  <dig> of  <dig> parent sites and at  <dig> of  <dig> mutant sites.

volunteers  <dig> and  <dig> were inoculated in the first iteration. volunteers  <dig> and  <dig> were inoculated in the second iteration. volunteers  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were inoculated in the third iteration. af = female, m = male. bp = 35000hp, m = 35000hpompp <dig> 

the overall papule formation rate for both the parent and the mutant was 100% at  <dig> sites each. papules were similar in size at mutant sites  as at parent sites  24 h after inoculation . the overall pustule formation rate was  <dig> %  at  <dig> parent sites and  <dig> %  at  <dig> mutant sites . thus, the ompp <dig> mutant was as virulent as the parent.

for the parent and mutant broth cultures used to prepare the inocula,  <dig> of  <dig> parent colonies and  <dig> of  <dig> mutant colonies tested were phenotypically correct . h. ducreyi was recovered intermittently from surface cultures of sites inoculated with the parent or mutant. of the  <dig> sites that were inoculated with the parent,  <dig>  yielded at least one positive surface culture, while  <dig> of  <dig> mutant sites  yielded a positive surface culture . all colonies obtained from surface cultures  and biopsy specimens  from parent sites and mutant sites, respectively, were phenotypically correct. thus, all tested colonies from the inocula, surface cultures and biopsy specimens had the expected phenotype.

biological activity of anti-ompp <dig> antiserum
the abilities of h. ducreyi to resist phagocytosis and complement-mediated bactericidal activity are key features of the organism’s pathogenesis  <cit> . although the h. ducreyi ompp <dig> mutant was not attenuated for pustule formation in the human challenge model, immunization with ompp <dig> could elicit protective antibodies that enhance bactericidal or phagocytic activity, as has been observed with nthi e . therefore, we recombinantly expressed ompp <dig> and tested its ability to generate biologically active antibodies in mice. using western blot analysis, the polyclonal mouse antiserum uniquely bound to purified recombinant ompp <dig> and to a  <dig>  kda membrane protein, the predicted molecular weight of ompp <dig>  from whole cell lysates prepared from 35000hp .

we used this hyperimmune mouse serum  raised against recombinant ompp <dig>  and compared the percent survival of 35000hp in 10% hms-p <dig>  as a positive control for bactericidal antibody activity against h. ducreyi, we used hyperimmune pig serum previously shown to enhance bactericidal activity   <cit> . as expected, the mean percent survival of 35000hp decreased from  <dig> % ±  <dig> % in normal pig serum to  <dig> % ±  <dig> % in hyperimmune pig serum. in contrast, the mean percent survival of 35000hp was  <dig> % ±  <dig> % in normal mouse serum  compared with  <dig> % ±  <dig> % in hms-p <dig>  thus, hms-p <dig> did not promote bactericidal killing of 35000hp.

we next investigated the ability of hms-p <dig> to promote phagocytosis of 35000hp by mouse monocyte-macrophage j774a. <dig> cells using quantitative phagocytosis assays. after opsonization with nms, the mean percent phagocytosed 35000hp was  <dig> % ±  <dig> % compared to  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of bacteria phagocytosed after opsonization with hms-p <dig> ; thus, anti-ompp <dig> antibodies did not enhance phagocytosis of h. ducreyi.

discussion
h. ducreyi expresses at least  <dig> genes encoding lipoproteins in vivo  <cit> , only three of which have been characterized for their roles in pathogenesis in humans  <cit> . for this study, we examined a previously uncharacterized lipoprotein, ompp <dig>  which has homology to the h. influenzae vaccine candidate e . there are two phenotypic classes of h. ducreyi strains, which express different immunotypes and proteomes  <cit> . ompp <dig> transcripts are expressed both in vitro and during human infection  <cit> , and ompp <dig> was conserved among all class i and class ii clinical isolates of h. ducreyi that were tested, although there were minor differences in the deduced amino acid sequences between the class i and class ii ompp <dig> alleles sequenced. these data, coupled with the protein’s homology to e , led us to hypothesize that ompp <dig> may play an essential role in the formation of pustules in the human challenge model. however, 35000hpompp <dig> caused pustules to form at the same rate as the parent strain, indicating that ompp <dig> is not necessary for virulence in humans. whether ompp <dig> contributes to virulence for class ii strains, which are not genetically tractable, is unknown.

the experimental model of human infection closely mimics natural infection, but it is limited to the papular and pustular stages of disease. in natural disease, pustules do not evolve into ulcers until several weeks after initial infection. thus, we cannot rule out a role for ompp <dig> during the ulcerative stage of disease. however, during experimental infection, h. ducreyi remains extracellular, where it associates with collagen, fibrin, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages. these relationships are maintained in natural ulcers  <cit>  and thus it is unlikely that ompp <dig> contributes to the ulcerative stage.

one of the attractive characteristics of e  as a vaccine candidate is its ability to generate bactericidal and/or protective antibodies. we therefore examined whether antibodies against ompp <dig> could block the organism’s ability to resist either serum bactericidal activity or phagocytosis. ompp4-specific mouse antiserum had no effect on h. ducreyi’s survival in serum bactericidal assays or on h. ducreyi’s uptake by murine macrophages. it is possible that important conformational epitopes of native ompp <dig> lipoprotein were not retained by the recombinant, non-lipidated ompp <dig> antigen used. however, similar manipulations did not abrogate the ability of e  to elicit bactericidal antibodies. overall, our data suggest that, unlike nthi e , h. ducreyi ompp <dig> is not a strong vaccine candidate.

e  is essential for heme uptake by nthi under aerobic conditions  <cit> . like h. influenzae, h. ducreyi is dependent upon uptake of iron in the context of a porphyrin ring such as heme or hemoglobin for its survival. 35000hpompp <dig> and 35000hp had similar growth rates under the heme-replete conditions used for the human challenge model, suggesting that ompp <dig> is not essential for heme uptake. h. ducreyi also encodes three tonb-dependent receptors, including hemoglobin receptor hgba, heme receptor tdha, and the uncharacterized tdx, for uptake of heme/iron. among these three receptors, only hgba is required for virulence in the human model of chancroid, and hgba alone is both necessary and sufficient for heme/iron acquisition by h. ducreyi <cit> . thus, h. ducreyi expresses several redundant mechanisms for acquiring this essential nutrient, and any contribution of ompp <dig> to heme/iron uptake, like those of tdha or tdx, is likely secondary to the activity of hgba.

h. influenzae e  is necessary for utilization of the essential coenzyme nad + . members of the pasteurellaceae cannot synthesize nad + de novo and must salvage either nad + or a suitable nicotinamide-based precursor from their environment  <cit> . so-called v-factor dependent pasteurellaceae can only utilize nad + or the precursors nicotinamide mononucleotide  or nicotinamide riboside   <cit> . this nad + salvage pathway is well characterized in h. influenzae <cit> : nad+, nmn, and nr pass through porins into the periplasm, where nad + is converted to nmn by the enzyme nadn, and nmn is converted to nr primarily through the catalytic activity of e   <cit> . the inner membrane transporter pnuc then transports nr into the cytoplasm, where the enzyme nadr converts nr to nad +  <cit> .

in contrast to h. influenzae, v-factor independent pasteurellaceae, such as h. ducreyi, can utilize the precursor nicotinamide  to synthesize nad +  <cit> . in this alternative salvage pathway, nam diffuses across the cell wall into the cytoplasm, where the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase nadv converts nam to nmn, which is then converted to nad + by an unidentified nmn adenylyltransferase  <cit> . critical to this alternative salvage pathway is the enzyme nadv; in h. ducreyi strains, the nadv gene is carried on extrachromosomal or integrated copies of plasmid pnad <dig>  suggesting horizontal transfer of nadv <cit> . strain 35000hp, used to generate the ompp <dig> mutant, contains two tandem, chromosomal copies of pnad <dig>  <cit> . a previous study reported that h. ducreyi 35000hp encodes a complete h. influenzae-like nad + salvage pathway  <cit> . however, at that time the h. ducreyi genome and its annotation were only available in preliminary form. our analysis of the finalized h. ducreyi 35000hp genome showed that, while 35000hp includes full-length orfs predicted to encode intact homologs of e   and the nr transporter pnuc , the homologs of nadn and nadr are pseudogenes. h. influenzae nadr is a bifunctional enzyme whose c-terminus contains nmn adenylyltransferase activity  <cit> . possibly, the 3’ end of the h. ducreyi nadr pseudogene may express a truncated nadr with this activity. alternatively, an as-yet-unidentified enzyme is required to convert nmn to nad + in h. ducreyi. overall, the absence of intact nadn and nadr genes suggests that the h. influenzae-like nad + salvage pathway is dispensible in h. ducreyi because of nadv-driven utilization of nam. nadv activity most likely accounts for our finding that 35000hpompp <dig> harbored no discernible growth defects. 35000hp is the only h. ducreyi strain whose genome is available to date; thus, whether ompp <dig> activity is more critical for nad + utilization in other h. ducreyi strains, and whether other strains harbor a complete h. influenzae-like nad + salvage pathway, is unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
the outer membrane protein ompp <dig> is not required for virulence of h. ducreyi in human disease. antibodies raised against the recombinant ompp <dig> protein were not able to enhance phagocytic uptake or serum bactericidal activity, suggesting that ompp <dig> would not be a suitable candidate for an h. ducreyi vaccine. the known functions of e  in h. influenzae, including heme uptake and nmn conversion to nr in the nad utilization pathway, are accomplished by different mechanisms in h. ducreyi. a common theme in bacterial pathogenesis is the redundancy of mechanisms used to accomplish tasks critical for a pathogen’s survival. thus, although e  plays an important role in h. influenzae pathogenesis, the activity of its homolog in h. ducreyi appears to be redundant with the virulence factor hgba and the nadv-dependent nad + salvage pathway.
