BACKGROUND
natural killer t  cells represent a small but important subset of t lymphocytes with characteristics of both t and nk cells. they have potent immunoregulatory function that reportedly can promote cell-mediated immunity to tumors and infectious organisms and, paradoxically, suppress cell-mediated immunity associated with autoimmune disease and allograft rejection  <cit> . in mice, these cells express nk cell markers such as nk <dig>  and cd <dig>  as well as t-cell receptors  α/β with a restricted repertoire  <cit> . the invariant t cell receptor α chain vα14-jα <dig> with a conserved cdr <dig> region is associated with vβ <dig> , vβ <dig> or vβ <dig> gene segments  <cit> .

in contrast to conventional t-lymphocytes, the tcr of nkt cells does not interact with antigens presented by classical major histocompatibility complex -encoded class i or ii molecules. instead, their tcr recognizes glycolipids presented by cd1d, which is a mhc class-i-like glycoprotein that belongs to a group of cd <dig> molecules associated with β2-microglobulin  <cit> . cd1d is known to present lipids including glycosylceramides and glycosylphosphatidylinositol  <cit> . activation via cd1d initiates the production of both th <dig>  and th <dig> cytokines   <cit> , and increases the cytolytic activity of nkt cells  <cit> .

nkt cells do not represent a homogeneous population. so far, three types of nkt cells have been described. first, there is an invariant vα14-nkt cell  also called a type i nkt cell or inkt cell. this group can be further differentiated into cd4+ single positive and cd4-cd8- double-negative variants. second, a population of cd1d-reactive nkt cells expressing diverse non-vα14tcrs, referred to as type ii nkt cells, has also been characterized. a third category has been termed nkt-like cells, which are cd1d-independent and express diverse tcrs  <cit> .

despite many years of nkt cell research, controversy remains about defining these cells. the expression of several surrogate markers, such as nk <dig>  in c57bl/ <dig> mice and cd <dig> in humans, co-expressed with the tcrα/β, have been frequently used for nkt cell identification  <cit> . there are also nk <dig> + t cells which do not express the semiinvariant vα14-jα <dig> t cell receptor and are not cd1d-dependent, excluding their consideration as nkt cells.

a common marker for nkt cells in nk <dig> - mice strains is the antibody dx <dig>  which recognizes the α2-integrin cd49b  <cit> . dx <dig> was initially characterized as a marker for nk cells  <cit>  and more recently dx <dig> co-expressing cd3+ lymphocytes have been described  <cit> . several studies, including some from our group, revealed evidence for immunoregulatory properties of these cells  <cit> . dx5+nkt cells produce th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines after stimulation like other nkt cells and seem to play a central role in anti-tumor immunity  <cit> . recently published studies suggest an immune modulatory function of dx5+nkt cells after bone marrow and solid organ transplantation  <cit> . although all these studies describe typical characteristics of nkt cells, pellecci et al. showed that dx5+ t cell numbers were normal in cd1d-/- and even in tcr jα18-/- mice  <cit> . therefore, it is more likely that dx5+nkt cells belong to the third group of nkt-like cells  <cit> .

in the present study we have further characterized dx5+cd3+ t cells referred to as dx5+nkt cells in nk <dig> -  and nk <dig> +  mice. for this purpose dx5+nkt cells were isolated from spleen and liver and several t and nk cell surface markers as well as maturation and activation markers were studied by flow cytometry. distinct differences could be found between both subsets and between mouse strains.

RESULTS
t cell marker expression is different between spleen and liver dx5+nkt cells
lymphocytes were isolated from spleen and liver of balb/c mice by macs and facs sorting . first, expression of different t cell markers were analyzed to evaluate which subtype of nkt cells the dx5+nkt subset belong to. in the spleen of balb/c mice,  <dig> ±  <dig> % of freshly isolated dx5+nkt cells expressed tcrα/β, with  <dig> ±  <dig> % of cells expressing vβ <dig> / <dig>  . surprisingly, most dx5+nkt cells expressed cd <dig> , with  <dig> ± 2% expressing cd8a and cd <dig>  interestingly, freshly isolated liver dx5+nkt cells displayed a different receptor pattern. these cells expressed more vβ <dig> / <dig>   and less cd <dig> .

thus far, surface receptor expression was only examined in freshly isolated cells. since dx5+nkt cells display their immunoregulating function especially upon activation  <cit> , expression patterns after stimulation were analyzed. for this purpose, splenic and hepatic mononuclear cells were stimulated for  <dig> hours with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> antibodies. activation of spleen dx5+nkt cells from balb/c mice  resulted in a down-regulation of tcrα/β  and an up-regulation of cd <dig> . however, stimulation had little effect on liver derived cells of balb/c mice. dx5+nkt cells revealed an expression pattern similar to that of freshly isolated cells: there was no down-regulation of tcrα/β in liver derived dx5+nkt cells upon stimulation.

nk cell and activatory markers are expressed differently in spleen and liver dx5+nkt cells
to further characterize the differences between spleen and liver dx5+nkt cells, specific antibodies were used to detect different nk cell types, as well as maturation and activation markers by flow cytometry. in the spleen of balb/c mice  the nk cell marker cd <dig> was expressed on  <dig> ±  <dig> % of dx5+nkt cells. again, dx5+nkt cells in the liver displayed differences. cd <dig> was expressed on significantly more cells than in the spleen . after  <dig> h stimulation, no significant change in the nk cell receptor pattern was observed in splenic or hepatic dx5+nkt cells. as expected, the nk cell marker nk <dig>  was expressed only on very few splenic  and hepatic  dx5+nkt cells .

we also analyzed if the distinct phenotype of spleen and liver dx5+nkt cells was based on differences in the maturation status. therefore, freshly isolated cells were stained with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd62l antibodies . spleen dx5+nkt cells were positive for cd <dig> in  <dig> ±  <dig> % of cells. in contrast, freshly isolated liver dx5+nkt cells expressed this maturation marker less frequently . freshly isolated spleen dx5+nkt cells were even more frequently positive for the maturation marker cd62l  compared to liver dx5+nkt cells . upon  <dig> h stimulation, liver dx5+nkt cells displayed an increase in cd62l expression , but still significantly less than the spleen subset .

next, differences in activation markers were evaluated. in freshly isolated dx5+nkt cells the activation marker cd <dig> was expressed on approximately 80% of splenic and hepatic cells and displayed no significant change upon stimulation . in contrast, upon  <dig> h stimulation, there was a strong up-regulation of the activating marker cd <dig>  in spleen dx5+nkt cells . however, liver dx5+nkt cells did not display a similar up-regulation of cd <dig> . another activating marker, cd <dig>  was also not significantly expressed on freshly isolated dx5+nkt cells, but upon  <dig> h stimulation, there was an up-regulation of cd <dig> in the spleen subset .

spleen and liver dx5+nkt cells display a distinct cytokine secretion pattern in balb/c mice
results thus far suggest distinct phenotypic differences between spleen and liver dx5+nkt cells. next, the production of th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines were compared to further assess functional differences between these subsets. lymphocytes were isolated from spleen and liver of balb/c mice and cultured for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h in the presence of anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> antibodies. the cells were additionally incubated with pma, ionomycin and golgiplug for intracellular cytokine staining.

as shown in figure  <dig>  we first stained for th <dig> cytokines such as il- <dig>  ifn-γ and tnfα. after 4h stimulation,  <dig> ± 8% of spleen dx5+nkt cells produced il- <dig>  after  <dig> h, the number of il-2-producing cells decreased . as expected, liver dx5+nkt cells showed a distinct th <dig> cytokine profile. after  <dig> h, lower cell numbers produced il- <dig>  compared to spleen cells. spleen dx5+nkt cells were also positive for ifn-γ after  <dig> h ,  <dig> h  and  <dig> h . in contrast, liver dx5+nkt cells produced less frequently ifn-γ after  <dig> h  and  <dig> h . after  <dig> h splenic dx5+nkt cells produced also tnfα . however, the number of tnfα-producing cells decreased after  <dig> h . liver dx5+nkt cells again displayed differences; after  <dig> h they produced slightly less tnfα compared to the spleen subset  and, after  <dig> h, the number of tnfα-producing cells decreased even more .

next, th <dig> cytokines such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> were analyzed. only very few spleen dx5+nkt cells produced il- <dig> after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. however, the number of il- <dig> positive liver dx5+nkt cells increased after  <dig> h . neither spleen nor liver dx5+nkt cells were significantly positive for il- <dig> at any time point . spleen dx5+nkt cells showed a significant increase in the frequency of il-10-producing cells after  <dig> h  compared to  <dig> h , and compared to liver dx5+nkt cells after  <dig> h stimulation . in the spleen the number of il-13-producing dx5+nkt cells significantly increased after  <dig> h compared to  <dig> h , whereas in liver the number of il- <dig> positive dx5+nkt cells peaked after  <dig> h compared to  <dig> h . furthermore, we tested for il-17a as a th17-type cytokine. liver dx5+nkt cells after  <dig> h more frequently produced il-17a  compared to the splenic-derived cells ; after  <dig> h, the frequency of liver-derived il-17a-producing dx5+nkt cells decreased .

nk <dig> +c57bl/ <dig> mice reveal distinct surface marker expression on dx5+nkt cells
data thus far were obtained using a nk <dig> - mouse strain. these findings were compared to a second mouse strain known to express nk <dig> , c57bl/ <dig> mice.. several t cell markers were analyzed. a down-regulation of tcrα/β  was also observed upon activation of spleen dx5+nkt cells from c57bl/ <dig> mice . compared to balb/c, fewer freshly isolated spleen dx5+nkt cells expressed cd <dig> , but more expressed cd8a . nk cell markers showed significant differences between both mouse strains . in c57bl/ <dig> mice  <dig> ±  <dig> % of freshly isolated spleen dx5+nkt cells were stained for cd <dig>  and  <dig> ± 1% for nk <dig>  . compared to balb/c mice , fewer spleen dx5+nkt cells displayed the maturation marker cd <dig> , but more expressed cd62l . in terms of activating markers, both mouse strains showed little expression of cd <dig> or cd <dig> in freshly isolated dx5+nkt cells . however, upon activation, the up-regulation of cd <dig>  was less distinctive in c57bl/ <dig> mice, whereas cd <dig> expression was similar to balb/c mice .

cytokine production of spleen dx5+nkt cells is different in nk <dig> -balb/c and nk <dig> + c57bl/ <dig> mice
results have already shown distinct phenotypic differences in dx5+nkt cells between nk <dig> - and nk <dig> + mice strains. next, cytokine production was compared to further assess potential functional differences between these subsets. lymphocytes were isolated from spleens of balb/c and c57bl/ <dig> mice and cultured for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h. as shown in figure  <dig> spleen dx5+nkt cells from the nk <dig> + mouse strain displayed a distinct th <dig> cytokine profile. compared to nk <dig> -balb/c mice, dx5+nkt cells less often produced il- <dig>  and tnf-α  after 4h; however, production of ifn-γ was similar. in terms of th <dig> cytokines, there was also no significant il- <dig> production in spleen dx5+nkt cells from the nk <dig> + mouse strain. there were some differences in th <dig> cytokine production between nk <dig> - and nk <dig> + mice. after  <dig> h, spleen dx5+nkt cells in nk <dig> + c57bl/ <dig> mice less frequently produced il- <dig>  and il- <dig> . the number of splenic-derived il-17a-producing dx5+nkt cells was similar in both mouse strains. only a few spleen dx5+nkt cells produced il17a after  <dig> h and  <dig> h.

discussion
all freshly isolated dx5+nkt cells from nk <dig>  deficient balb/c mice were positive for tcrα/β, as expected for type iii nkt cells  <cit> . most of them additionally expressed cd <dig>  and a few expressed cd8a and cd <dig>  as mentioned in other reports for spleen and thymus  <cit> , a difference between spleen and liver subsets was observed. liver dx5+nkt cells expressed less cd <dig> and cd62l. since expression of cd62l is associated with naivety or homing to peripheral lymph nodes in inkt-cells  <cit> , and cd <dig> becomes down-regulated after repeated activation  <cit> , this suggests a higher maturational status of liver dx5+nkt cells in balb/c mice. this is supported by the finding that vβ <dig> -containing vα14i tcrs in nkt cells have a higher antigen affinity than those containing vβ <dig> or vβ <dig>  <cit> . consistent with the idea of a negative selection, liver dx5+nkt cells displayed a higher expression of vβ <dig> / <dig> .

upon activation, a down-regulation of tcrα/β was observed in spleen dx5+nkt cells in balb/c mice. a decrease of tcrα/β-expression was also reported for nk <dig> +nkt cells  <cit> . due to a lack of detection, a rapid apoptotic death of this cell was initially claimed upon stimulation  <cit> . more recently tcrα/β-down-regulation in spleen and liver nk <dig> +nkt cells of c57bl/ <dig> mice was discovered to be the reason for this assumed cell disappearance  <cit> . however, our study does not confirm this finding for liver dx5+nkt cells in balb/c mice, supporting evidence that there are distinct subsets of dx5+nkt cells in the spleen and liver. cd <dig> expression was also increased upon stimulation. as the ligand of cd <dig>  cd <dig> represents a co-stimulatory molecule and is expressed by activated and regulatory t cells  <cit> . furthermore, cd <dig>  the ligand of fas responsible for the extrinsic induction of apoptosis  was up-regulated  <cit> . this up-regulation was more evident in spleen than in liver dx5+nkt cells and is also reported for nk <dig> +nkt cells  <cit> . taken together, liver dx5+nkt cells are more mature and display a different activating phenotype upon stimulation compared to the spleen subset.

since nkt cells are supposed to link innate and adaptive immunity by rapid secretion of cytokines, including ifnγ, tnfα, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  gm-csf and il- <dig>  <cit> , we further assessed differences between spleen and liver dx5+nkt cells on a functional basis. fewer liver dx5+nkt cells in balb/c mice produced th <dig> cytokines such as il- <dig>  ifn-γ, and tnf-α. in terms of th <dig> cytokines, more liver dx5+ntk cells produced il- <dig>  but fewer produced il- <dig> compared to the spleen subset. charbonnier et al. described an induction of il- <dig> production in liver cd49b+cd4+ t cells by immature dendritic cell vaccination  <cit> . however, we did not confirm this finding for liver dx5+nkt cells in balb/c mice after anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig> stimulation. collectively, the limited th <dig> cytokine secretion upon stimulation confirmed the observation that a different activating phenotype of dx5+nkt cells exists in the liver of balb/c mice.

recently, type i nkt cells have been shown to be capable of producing il- <dig>  potentially implicating this cell type in inflammatory conditions  <cit> . we showed that a subset of dx5+nkt cells in the liver of balb/c mice has to be taken into account as an il- <dig> producing cell. these results are consistent with our result regarding a more mature phenotype of liver-derived dx5+nkt cells, with a different phenotypical profile upon stimulation compared to the spleen subset.

in nk <dig> + c57bl/ <dig> mice fewer spleen dx5+nkt cells revealed expression of cd <dig>  but more of cd8a. these findings are consistent with data from pellici et al., who observed similar differences in c57bl/ <dig> mice  <cit> . in accordance with conzalez et al., 40-50% of dx5+nkt cells express nk <dig>   <cit> . taking these results together with the higher cd <dig> expression in nk <dig> -deficient balb/c mice, we suggest that these mice compensate for a reduced number of nk. <dig> +nkt cells with a higher prevalence of cd4+dx5+nkt cells. in contrast to results from gonzalez et al.  <cit> , about one-third of these cells in the spleen of c57bl/ <dig> mice, and 11% in balb/c mice, were cd8+.

upon activation a down-regulation of tcrα/β was observed in spleen dx5+nkt cells in balb/c and in c57bl/ <dig> mice, as it has been reported for nk <dig> +nkt cells  <cit> . furthermore, upon a  <dig> h stimulation there was a notable up-regulation of cd <dig> in balb/c versus c57bl/ <dig> mice. cd <dig>  the il- <dig> receptor α-chain, is proposed to be a phenotypical marker of regulatory t cells  <cit> . the up-regulation we observed especially for spleen dx5+nkt cells in balb/c mice could be either due to activation and increased receptor expression based on the regulatory background of dx5+nkt cells or due to a natural selection because of a higher apoptotic resistance in cd4+cd25+ t cells  <cit> . another marker for activation on regulatory t cells is cd <dig>  <cit> . cd <dig> expression was increased upon stimulation in spleen dx5+nkt cells in balb/c mice, but was significantly less prominent in c57bl/ <dig> mice. upon  <dig> h stimulation, cd <dig>  was similarly up-regulated  <cit>  on splenic dx5+nkt cells in both mice strains. however, after  <dig> h stimulation cd <dig> expression was decreased in balb/c versus c57bl/ <dig> mice, and cd <dig> was further up-regulated in balb/c, but down-regulated in c57bl/ <dig> mice . these changes suggest a more regulatory cd4+cd25+ phenotype in nk <dig> - balb/c and a more cd8+ and cd178+ driven cytotoxic component in the nk <dig> + c57bl/ <dig> mouse strain  <cit> .

high il- <dig> production by dx5+nkt cells in the early phase of activation was observed only in balb/c mice, further supporting our findings of interstrain differences. moreover, splenic dx5+nkt cells in c57bl/ <dig> mice displayed a more one-sided th <dig> cytokine profile, with mostly ifnγ and tnfα producing cells, which is also described for cd8+ t cells  <cit> . dx5+nkt cells in balb/c mice displayed a more polyfunctional cytokine profile. in the late phase of stimulation, ifnγ and tnfα production decreased and il- <dig> and il- <dig> secretion increased. in contrast to liver cd49b+cd4+ cells  <cit> , and supporting our data regarding splenic dx5+nkt cells, kassiotis et al. revealed no il- <dig> production for splenic cd49b+cd4+ t cells in c57bl/ <dig> mice  <cit> . furthermore, pellicci et al. could not detect any significant il- <dig> production in dx5+tcrα/β+cd1d-tet+ cells in the same mouse strain  <cit> . confirming our finding and giving again evidence for a difference between both mouse strains, we showed a significant increase in il- <dig> production after 24h stimulation for splenic dx5+nkt cells in balb/c mice. taken together, these results suggesting a more one-sided th <dig> cytokine production from dx5+nkt cells in c57bl/ <dig> mice confirm their more cd <dig> and cd <dig> expressing phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our data show that distinct subsets of dx5+nkt cells exist within nk <dig> - balb/c mice. in the spleen these cells appear more naive with a higher cd62l expression and an up-regulation of cd <dig> and cd <dig> upon activation. in contrast, in the liver dx5+nkt cells are more mature and display a different regulatory potency upon stimulation. furthermore, there are remarkable inter-strain differences. in nk <dig> + c57bl/ <dig> mice, fewer dx5+nkt cells are cd4+ and more are cd8+, confirming their cd <dig> and th1-sided functional behavior upon activation.
