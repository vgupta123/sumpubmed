BACKGROUND
thermal stimulation is a natural modality to induce nociception. in addition, it is able to stimulate c-fibre nociceptors and is therefore suitable to detect opioid induced antinociception  <cit> . in horses, radiant heat stimulating the lateral aspect of the fetlock, the coronary band and the withers was used to determine the latency of the hoof withdrawal reflex  or skin twitching reflex  after fentanyl  <cit> , local anaesthetics  <cit>  or buprenorphine  <cit> . contact heat thermal threshold testing by ramped heating has been used for the detection of the analgesic efficacy of lidocaine  <cit> , fentanyl and butorphanol  <cit>  and buprenorphine  <cit>  in horses by performing thermal stimulation at the withers.

however, the type of nocifensive response and its detection varies between body regions and might therefore influence the determination of thermal thresholds. transmission of a noxious stimulus at the body travels through the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and ascends to the brain via the spinothalamic tract  <cit> . assessment of the skin twitch in response to nociceptive stimulation at the withers involves direct reflex pathways . in contrast, sensory innervation of the forehead is carried by the trigeminal nerve and the trigeminal ganglion entering the brainstem at the level of the pons  <cit> . nocifensive reflexes in response to painful stimulation of the tooth root  or the supraorbital nerve  with contraction of the splenius muscle  are described in different species  <cit> . however, coordinated behaviour like head shaking or rubbing the face against an object can be considered as result of conscious perception. nociceptive stimulation at the head or the body might result in differences in thermal thresholds, depending on recognition and definition of end points. in addition, drugs affecting alertness might have differential influences on reflex responses and conscious reactions.

therefore, the aim of the study was to compare the effect of neuroleptic sedation with acepromazine and neuroleptanalgesia with acepromazine and buprenorphine on tts obtained at the nostrils and at the withers. the hypothesis was that neuroleptic sedation and neuroleptanalgesia would inhibit conscious reactions to a greater extent than reflex responses.

RESULTS
skin temperature
there was no significant change in skin temperature at n over the course of the experiment in group s or ace, but in group ab there was a statistically significant increase in skin temperature over the first measurements . skin temperatures at the withers increased significantly in group s and ab for the first measurements and decreased significantly in group ace 165 minutes after injection for the next four hours .

mean  skin temperatures in  <dig> horses at the withers or nostrils treated with saline, acepromazine or acepromazine + buprenorphine intravenously. fifteen minutes before drug administration baseline measurement was performed and the first measurement was started 15 minutes after drug injection.

a, b = values with different superscripts differ significantly within each treatment group .

thermal threshold
thermal threshold temperatures at the nostril did not change over the observation period in group s and group ace . in group ab, tts were significantly increased from 15 minutes until 405 minutes after treatment compared to the baseline measurement  and compared to tts in group s and group ace. at w, there was also no change in tts after treatment in group s and group ace . similar to stimulation at n tts increased above baseline in group ab from  <dig> to 405 minutes after treatment . during the same period tts in group ab were significantly increased compared to group s and group ace. thermal thresholds were not different between n and w. analysis based on standardized thermal excursion  did not change the results .

reaction to stimulation, sedation and side effects
the most frequent reaction to thermal stimulation at n was head shaking  followed by rubbing the face . stimulation at w was mostly answered with skin twitching  rarely with shaking the whole body  or turning the head towards the stimulus .

all horses became mildly to moderately sedated  15 minutes after ace lasting for  <dig> to 150 minutes . in group ab, a median sedation score of  <dig>  <cit>  was reached and sedation lasted  <dig> to 210 minutes . in this group  <dig> horse did not become sedated and another horse was deeply sedated .

gastrointestinal sounds were reduced or absent from  <dig> to 75 minutes after ab administration and lasted for  <dig> to 510 minutes . the horse not showing signs of sedation in group ab developed signs of colic one hour after the experiment was completed. an impaction of the large colon was diagnosed and treated medically without further complications. in group ab, excitatory phenomena like restlessness and box walking were observed in  <dig> of  <dig> horses starting with waning sedative effects of acepromazine . after treatment with ab restlessness persisted for  <dig> to 480 minutes , in  <dig> horses restlessness started  <dig> to 75 minutes after injection, in  <dig> horses  <dig> to 225 minutes after drug administration. increased salivation or tear production was observed in four horses 15 minutes after injection of ab for up to 60 minutes.

skin lesions
mild swelling without pain on palpation occurred at the nostrils in group ab occasionally when the thermode was heated up to cut-out temperature. there were no skin lesions after administration of s or ace.

discussion
thermal thresholds determined by ramped contact heat at the head or the body to assess cutaneous anti-nociception in horses were comparable. heat stimulation at both body sites allowed to recognize a clear end point, which was repeatable over several hours and responded to neuroleptic sedation and neuroleptanalgesia in a similar way.

type of end point and end point detection in response to thermal stimulation at different body parts as nostrils versus withers might influence the tt. with stimulation at the withers a skin flick was the most clear end point, whereas stimulation at the nostrils resulted in head shaking or rubbing the face against an object  <cit> . in contrast to the reflex pathway of the skin flick reflex, which is mediated by the spinothalamic tract  <cit> , responses to stimulation at the head like head shaking involves the trigeminal nerve and individual conscious perception and reaction to the stimulus  <cit> . head jerking as part of the nocifensive trigemino cervical reflex was not observed with heat stimulation in the current study. skin twitch at the withers is considered to be a more clear end point than the hoof withdrawal reflex, when testing effects of opioids because they interfere with the hoof withdrawal reflex as a result of the increase in spontaneous locomotor activity  <cit> . opioids can also induce head nodding in horses and can make end point detection at the head more difficult. however, in the present study there was no difference in skin temperatures, threshold temperatures and changes in thresholds between stimulation at the head and the withers detected. a skin twitch is a very obvious and repeatable reaction, however, variability of thermal thresholds at the nostrils was in fact lower than at the withers, indicating that the defensive reaction at the head can repeatedly be detected despite being a more individual, behavioural response, which is not influenced by sedation.

baseline thresholds were stable over  <dig> consecutive measurements and no conditioning to the stimulation procedure or the noxious stimulus was observed in our study. this is in agreement with previous studies in horses using a similar stimulation set up  <cit> . in contrast, horses became conditioned to the light stimulus with radiation heat stimulation  <cit>  or to touch with mechanical pressure stimulation to the front leg before the stimulus became painful  <cit> .

the standard heating rate of the thermode based system for cats  resulted in very variable threshold temperatures and skin lesions in horses  <cit> . reducing the heating rates to  <dig> °c/s and  <dig> °c/s gave clearer end points and more consistent threshold temperatures but also caused restlessness during the lower heating rates  <cit> . in contrast, in pretrials with our horse population the very slow heating rates resulted in burns at the nostrils. in a previous study stimulation with heating rates of  <dig> °c/s for the withers and  <dig> °c/s for the nostril allowed a clear end point detection without inflammation or damage of deeper skin layers  <cit> , but might have contributed to higher tts compared to other studies and other species because of a delay in heat transfer to thermal nociceptors in the face of a rapid increase of temperature at the skin surface. the necessary differences in heating rates at the different stimulation sites to avoid skin damage might be related to differences in skin architecture and skin thickness resulting in differences in heat transfer  <cit> . the chosen heating rates are thought to activate c-fibre nociceptors and induce low thermal thresholds like it was shown in rats where slow rates of heating  evoked responses at low thresholds activating primarily c-nociceptors  <cit> .

the mode of action of the used drugs is well known in horses and their sedative and analgesic actions were used to assess and compare the response of tts at different body sites. the sedative effect of acepromazine was variable between horses with a maximum effect about 45 minutes after injection. the phenothiazine tranquilizer is widely used in equines  <cit>  and is well known for its dose-dependent sedation  <cit>  and lack of somatic antinociceptive effects  <cit> . acepromazine has α1-adrenolytic activity, depresses the vasomotor center followed by hypotension, vasodilatation and increased digital blood flow  <cit> . these effects might interfere with the regulation of body and skin temperature. rectal temperatures weren’t measured in this study, however, a late decrease in skin temperatures after ace  was observed at the withers. as contact heat thermal stimulation in the present study was performed during moderate ambient temperatures  it can be assumed that the decrease in skin temperature was probably influenced by acepromazine.

as expected, buprenorphine, a semi-synthetic partial mu opioid agonist  <cit>  increased thermal thresholds measured at the nostril as well as at the withers for several hours. in our study thermal thresholds were already increased above baseline at the first post treatment stimulation . more frequent stimulation to detect earlier onset was not possible without active skin cooling. cut-out was also reached 15 minutes after administration of butorphanol  or buprenorphine  in a previous study in horses  <cit> .

in the present study anti-nociceptive effects lasted for approximately 7 hours, which is in close agreement with a mean duration of anti-nociception of  <dig>  hours after buprenorphine at the same dose reported in a previous study  <cit> . mean serum concentration of buprenorphine at the last time point with increased tts  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml. whereas levels of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml  did not result in analgesic effects anymore. for a more precise determination of minimal analgesic serum concentrations the threshold measurements would need to be performed more frequently. therefore the  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml can only be considered a crude estimate for minimal analgesic serum concentrations of buprenorphine. elimination half-life for buprenorphine was  <dig>  hours in the current study, which might even be underestimated as serum concentrations did not fall below the limit of quantification in the terminal phase. however, the determined terminal half-life is comparable to  <dig>  hours determined with a slightly lower dose of buprenorphine   <cit> . at a buprenorphine dose of  <dig>  mg/kg buprenorphine iv elimination half-life was shorter with  <dig>  hours  <cit>  suggesting a dose dependent effect, differences in sensitivity of the buprenorphine analysis or an influence of acepromazine co-medication.

almost all buprenorphine treated horses showed increased locomotor activity and signs of excitation for approximately 5 hours like it was described in previous studies  <cit> . locomotor activity became evident when acepromazine effects declined, which might interfere with the detection of behavioural responses to thermal stimulation  <cit> . it is discussed controversially whether opioid induced spontaneous locomotor activity results from activation of the dopaminergic pathways  <cit>  which might be ameliorated by acepromazine  <cit> . however, at the chosen doses the buprenorphine induced effects outlasted the sedative effects of acepromazine. in a previous study, sedative effects of acepromazine in horses were present for 240 minutes after iv injection of  <dig>  mg/kg  <cit>  a three times higher dose than in the current study. the degree of sedation after the acepromzine and buprenorphine combination was very variable and in some horses the duration of sedation seemed shorter than with acepromazine alone, which confirms the observation that sedative effects with a combination of buprenorphine and acepromazine in ponies were non-satisfying  <cit> .

another side effect of buprenorphine combined with acepromazine was reduction of gastrointestinal sounds for approximately 5 hours and abdominal discomfort in one horse 10 hours after drug administration. in other studies gastrointestinal borborygmi also decreased following buprenorphine which was attenuated when buprenorphine was given sublingually  <cit> . when hay was withdrawn 12 hours before intravenous buprenorphine, there were no signs of abdominal discomfort observed  <cit> .

there was a slight increase in skin temperatures at both body sites after ab as long as measurements were performed at 30 minute intervals. skin temperature in horses also rose after constant infusion rate with fentanyl  <cit>  but an increase in skin temperature or body temperature after buprenorphine were not seen in previous studies  <cit> . it might be possible that the skin was warming up due to the more frequent heating cycles at the beginning of the observation period in the current study.

CONCLUSIONS
thermal contact heat stimulation at both described body sites  give comparable results in the assessment of cutaneous nociception in horses. buprenorphine combined with acepromazine results in several hours of cutaneous anti-nociception associated with locomotor stimulation and reduced gastrointestinal sounds/activity in healthy horses.
