BACKGROUND
insects are highly successful terrestrial animals that have complicated communication systems. insect odorant binding proteins  play an important role in insect chemical communication. until recently, it was believed that pheromones and other odors entering the aqueous lumen of chemosensilla, were transported by obps to transmembrane odorant receptors   <cit>  and finally degraded by odorant degradation enzymes   <cit> . recently, however, an active role of obps has been reported, where a conformational change of the obp triggered by the presence of the ligand in its binding pocket that activated the membrane-bound receptor  <cit> . insect obps, particularly in lepidoptera, can be classified into two subfamilies, pheromone-binding proteins  and general odorant binding proteins  <cit> . obps are small and water soluble proteins  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids long. a typical feature of obps is the presence of six positional conserved cysteines. these six cysteines form three disulfide bridges, which play important roles in maintaining the protein tertiary structure. another essential criterion is an acceptable similarity in protein sequence  with other family members. insect chemosensory proteins  represent another gene family suggested to have similar properties in binding and transporting pheromones and other ligands. insect csps are smaller than obps with about 100- <dig> amino acids, and bear no sequence similarity with obps. csps have only four conserved cysteines linked by disulfide bridges between neighboring residues  <cit>  and are better conserved than obps across species  <cit> .

numerous efforts have been made to obtain the sequences of insect obps  <cit>  and csps  <cit>  by direct cloning, which normally involves designing degenerate primers based on conserved protein sequences, amplifying the fragment and obtaining the full length sequences by rapid amplification of cdna ends . thanks to the accomplishments of genome sequencing projects of several insect species, large scale new gene discovery is possible using bioinformatics. by searching available genome sequences, hekmat-scafe et al. found  <dig> obp genes in drosophila melanogaster and a new subfamily of obps  <cit> ; maleszka et al. showed that apis mellifera has only  <dig> obp genes <cit> ; zhou et al. identified  <dig> putative obps in aedes aegypti and  <dig> additional sequences in anopheles gambiae by developing a specific algorithm  <cit> . by comparative genomic analysis of the obp families in  <dig> drosophila genomes, vieira et al. identified  <dig> obp genes and found that purifying selection governs the evolution of the obp family  <cit> . in  <dig>  zhou et al. did a comprehensive searching for csp genes from insect genomes and ests and identified  <dig> putative csp genes from  <dig> insect species <cit> . gong et al. performed a genome-wide analysis based on the conserved cysteine residues and similarity to csps in other insects, finding  <dig> candidate csps in the silkworm  <cit> . however, genome searching for new genes is limited to a few insect species, as genome sequences are not available for most insects. fortunately, an increasing number of insect expressed sequence tags  are deposited in the dbest database of the national center for biotechnology information . insect ests are a valuable resource that has not been fully exploited for mining new obp or csp genes. pugalenthi et al. developed a new algorithm using regularized least squares classifier  to predict obps with a high accuracy of  <dig> %. this approach could be used to identify novel obps that have low similarities with known ones  <cit> . recently, zhou et al. used motifsearch algorithm to screen putative obps in the silkworm and found  <dig> obp-like genes, which is much fewer than that in fruit flies and mosquitoes <cit> .

here, we develop a computational pipeline to identify obp and csp genes from insect ests of  <dig> species across eight orders including blattaria, coleoptera, diptera, hemiptera, hymenoptera, lepidoptera, orthoptera and phthiraptera. in total,  <dig> new obps and  <dig> new csps were found, of which  <dig> genes from eight species were experimentally validated by rt-pcr. in addition, the conserved cysteines patterns, motif patterns and phylogenetic relationship of known obps and csps were analyzed.

RESULTS
identification of new obps and csps genes from insect ests
we collected  <dig>  insect ests from the dbest  <cit>  and constructed a local database for further analysis. the ests are from  <dig> insect species that cover eight orders of insecta. we searched for obps and csps with a computational pipeline as detailed in figure  <dig>  in total,  <dig>  ests were found to satisfy the strict criteria, and produce  <dig> obps from  <dig> species and  <dig> csps from  <dig> species. of these genes, more than 80% obps  and 70% csps  have not been reported before . we performed electronic elongation to get the sequences as long as possible and obtained the intact orfs of  <dig> obps and  <dig> csps. the nucleotide and protein sequences of predicted obps are listed in additional file  <dig> and  <dig>  and those of predicted csps in additional file  <dig> and  <dig> 

the numbers in parenthesis are new obps or csps found in this paper. nucleotide and protein sequences of these obps or csps are given in additional file  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> & <dig> 

in some insects, more than  <dig> obps or csps were identified. for example,  <dig> new obps were predicted in diabrotica virgifera and  <dig> in nasonia giraulti. fifteen csps were predicted in solenopsis invicta, of which  <dig> are not reported before, and  <dig> new csps genes were found in gryllus bimaculatus. however, fewer than five obps or csps were identified in most species. we plotted the number of identified obps or csps against the total number of ests in each species and could not find any clear relationship .

conserved cysteines pattern
the presence of conserved cysteines is a typical feature of obps and csps. we therefore analyzed the cysteines patterns  of obps and csps in different orders . generally, there were no major differences between different orders, except for the presence of a sub-class of obps, c-plus obps, in diptera containing eight conserved cysteines. in the typical c-pattern, there were three amino acids between the second and third cysteines in all obps, while eight residues were present between the fifth and sixth cysteines in most insect obps. the numbers of amino acids between the other three neighboring cysteines were rather variable. in order to evaluate the variability in the distances between each pair of neighboring cysteines, we calculated the coefficients of variation . in most insects, the distance between the fourth and the fifth cysteines was the most variable. however, in hymenoptera, the distance between the first and the second cysteines was the most variable with a coefficient of variation of  <dig> . the highest variations were found in the obps of diptera. by contrast, c-patterns of csps were much more conserved.

x: any amino acid. the c-pattern in diptera includes two types , which are listed separately. the accession numbers of obps and csps used in this analysis were listed in additional file  <dig> 

the coefficient of variation  was calculated as standard deviation divided by means. in diptera, the data for obps were calculated from obps of only 6-c pattern. the accession numbers of obps and csps used in this analysis were listed in additional file  <dig> 

motif-pattern analysis
the conserved motifs are important elements of functional domains. we used the meme server to discover conserved motifs in obps and csps <cit> . the full-length sequences of obp and csps either collected from the database or newly predicted in this work were used for motif analysis. parameters used in this and all other motif predictions of this study were: minimum width =  <dig>  maximum =  <dig>  maximum number of motif to find =  <dig>  as a result, eight motifs were found for both csps and obps. only five motifs were present in more than 50% of obps, while all eight motifs were present in more than 50% of csps .

since a high number of obp genes have been reported in species of lepidoptera, we carried out a motif-pattern analysis of gobps and pbps to compare the differences between these two subfamilies. the gobps and pbps were combined into one set of sequences and then submitted to meme server. although both gobps and pbps have the same eight motifs, the motif-patterns were quite different . the seventh motif was located at the c-terminus of all  <dig> tested pbps, but appeared at the n-terminus of  <dig> out of  <dig> gobps. only six gobps shared the same motif-pattern with pbps. interestingly, one gobp lacked the fifth motif and one had two copies of the seventh motif.

when the gobp sequences of both lepidopteran and dipteran were combined into a set of sequences for motif analysis, we also found that the motif patterns were different between lepidopteran and dipteran gobps . of the eight motifs in the lepidoptera, only the second and seventh were found in most dipteran gobps. the first, third and eighth motifs appeared in only one dipteran gobp. interestingly, the motif patterns of pbps were also different between the lepidoptera and hymenoptera. similarly, motif patterns of lepidopteran and dipteran pbps were analyzed by combining the pbp sequences of both lepidopteran and dipteran into a set of sequences. the order of the eight motifs in the lepidoptera was 7-3-2-4-5-8-6- <dig> whereas it was 3-7-4-2-5-1-8- <dig> in the hymenoptera . furthermore, one pbp lacked one motif and two pbps lacked five motifs in the hymenoptera. these differences may imply functional differences of obps in different orders. it should be noticed that the motifs found by meme server are not comparable when different sets of sequences were used for analysis. thus, it is not suitable to compare the motifs in different figures  since we used different input sequences.

phylogenetic analysis of obps and csps
the neighbor-joining trees were inferred by mega <dig>  using the p-distance amino acid model after  <dig> bootstrap replicates  <cit> . in the evolutionary tree for gobps and pbps, these two subfamilies were mainly clustered by orders, indicating that most genes appeared after diversification of different orders . this is consistent with the existence of an order-specific motif-pattern as described above, suggesting that most gobp and pbp genes have evolved recently. however, the situation is different for csps. although lepidopteran csps were mainly clustered as an independent group, some of their csps are in the same clade with other orders, suggesting that some csps are ancient, whereas others appeared after the diversification of orders .

experimental validation of identified obps and csps
most predicted obps or csps of full length were assembled from several ests. to validate the reliability of the computational pipeline, we randomly chose  <dig> obps from eight species and  <dig> csps from four species for rt-pcr validation. to cover a sequence that was as long as possible, the primers were designed at both ends of the transcripts assembled by the cap <dig> software. as a result,  <dig> obps and  <dig> csps were successfully amplified by rt-pcr. the pcr results were confirmed by sequencing . most validated obps and csps contains intact orfs.

discussion
with only a few insect genomes sequenced, expressed sequence tags  are a good resource for new gene discovery and expression profile analysis. as the cost of sequencing rapidly deceases, an abundance of insect ests has become available particularly in recent years, providing an opportunity to discover new obps and related genes at large-scale level. in this study, more than  <dig> new obps and csps were found from insect ests, suggesting that this approach is effective.

although more than  <dig> obp or csp genes were found in some insects, less than five obps were identified in most species. generally, there is no correlation between the number of identified genes and that of ests. though some obps and csps are ubiquitous or expressed in non-sensory organs, both these two classes of proteins are believed to be abundant in the antennae and other chemosensory organs. therefore, a high number of ests are not enough for finding many obps or csps if the ests were not from the chemosensory organs.

in agreement with previous reports <cit> , c-pattern and motif pattern analysis indicate that obps are more divergent than csps and suggests that obp genes are still evolving. zhou et al. used motif "c <dig> x6- <dig> c <dig> x16- <dig> c <dig> x <dig> c <dig> x3" to search csp genes and successfully found  <dig> new genes <cit> . in our work, the csp motifs analyzed by order are consistent with zhou's results. zhou et al. also analyzed the insect obps and obtained two motifs, "c <dig> x15- <dig> c <dig> x <dig> c <dig> x21- <dig> c <dig> x7- <dig> c <dig> x <dig> c6"for general obp and "c <dig> x8- <dig> c <dig> x <dig> c <dig> x39- <dig> c <dig> x17- <dig> c4a x <dig> c <dig> x <dig> c <dig> x9- <dig> c6a" for plus-c obp <cit> . generally, the motifs analyzed by order including new obp genes found in our work are similar with zhou's report. this proves the c-patterns of both obp and csp genes are highly conserved.

as most known pbp and gobp genes have been identified in the lepidoptera, we conducted a meme motif analysis to compare the difference between these two subfamilies of obp genes. interestingly, all pbps have an identical meme motif pattern as 6-1-2-8-3-4-5- <dig>  though they are more divergent than gobps at the protein-sequence level. gobps show four different motif patterns, with the most common one being 7-6-1-2-8-3-4- <dig>  to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of motif difference between gobp and pbp subfamilies. this difference in the motif pattern might imply a functional difference between pbps and gobps. meanwhile, it also provides a hint that gobp genes might have broad functions. generally, pbps bind and transport sex pheromones, while gobps are involved in sensing plant volatiles. recent report by zhou et al. proves that bmorgobp <dig> in b. mori can also bind sex pheromone component   <cit> . although sex pheromones in moths are species-specific, their chemical structures are similar, consisting of a hydrocarbon chain that contains an oxygenated functional group   <cit> . thus, it is reasonable that pbps from different insects have an identical motif. by contrast, gobps can bind both plant volatiles and sex pheromone, which display a broad diversity in chemical structures. we argued that this is the reason why gobps have divergent motif patterns.

in addition, we found that the c-patterns are similar, whereas the motif patterns are different among diverse orders. we reasoned that c-pattern is the key structure of obps and csps, which should be highly conserved. but motif pattern fine-tune the functions of obps and csps, leading to the minor difference in binding sex pheromone or plant volatiles in different insect orders.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results indicate that the computational pipeline we used in this study is efficient and reliable in identifying new obp and csp genes with insect est resources. the large number of the newly found obps and csps in our study provides the basis for functional studies of these proteins. in addition, analysis of protein sequences showed that there is generally no major difference in c-patterns of obps or csps between different insect orders, whereas conserved motif patterns are quite different between insect orders and between the gobps and pbps in lepidoptera. together with the evolutionary analysis, the results provide some new insights into the differentiation and evolution of insect obps and csps.
