BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of non-coding small rna molecules, generally  <dig> nucleotides  in length that regulate critical functions in plant and animal development. mirnas arise from an ~70-nt stem-loop rna precursor that is cleaved and modified by ribonuclease iii to create an ~21-nt single-stranded mirna  <cit> . generally, every mature mirna derives from one of the precursor’s arms and all are located in intergenic regions, indicating that mirna transcription is independent of other genes and has its own transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. mirnas regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through mrna cleavage or translational inhibition in both animals and plants  <cit> . in plant cells, the mirna sequence is almost completely complementary with target gene mrna, through a mechanism similar to rna interference , leading to the degradation of target gene mrna  <cit> . recently, numerous mirnas have been reported through cloning, high-throughput small rna sequencing, and computational approaches based on sequence similarities and secondary structure predictions  <cit> . because plant mirnas are almost exactly complementary to their corresponding target sequences  <cit> , target gene prediction is relatively straightforward and mainly through bioinformatics method.

in  <dig>  the first mirna  was reported in caenorhabditis elegance <cit> . then, reinhart et al.  <cit>  found the second metachronous switch gene, let- <dig>  in c. elegans. recently, with bioinformatics, molecular cloning technology improvements, and the establishment of model species cdna libraries, hundreds of small rna molecules have been successively reported in c. elegans <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , moss  <cit>  and in cotton  <cit> . almost  <dig>  mirnas have been annotated in magnoliophyta including  <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana and  <dig> from gossypium species, as of april  <dig>   <dig> . recently, with the sequencing of the g. raimondii  genome, many mirna precursors and mirnas were identified  <cit> . however, their distribution on the tetraploid cotton genome is unknown. to date, few mirnas have been functionally characterized in cotton, and almost no predicted target genes have been verified by experiments in cotton.

cotton is not only a fundamental world commodity that provides an important natural material, it is also an important oil crop. since the first mirna was reported, studies suggest that plant mirnas negatively regulate target genes involved in plant development, organ morphogenesis, auxin signaling, and environmental stress responses  <cit> . mirnas may also play an important role in cotton fiber development and the study of mirnas has far-reaching significance to improve fiber quality and yield  <cit> .

at this time, most mirnas and target gene research is focused on functional verification through gene over-expression, gene interference, and related methods, but there is paucity in development of mirna markers and their relationship with phenotypes. only one report in the literature described mirna markers- mirna-aflp   <cit> , but no mirnas or their target genes have been genetically mapped in cotton.

to address this gap and to map mirnas to understand their genomic distribution in cotton, we downloaded pre-mirna sequences reported in the literature and within the mirbase database . putative target genes were predicted by psrnatarget . specific primers were then designed based on the pre-mirna sequences and the target sites of the target genes, and mirna-based srap marker analysis was performed. primers were also designed surrounding the target sites in the putative target genes to indicate their chromosomal distribution. then, a network diagram between mirnas and their putative targets was constructed to reveal regulatory relationships. finally, rt-pcr analysis was conducted to detect expression differences between g. hirsutum and g. barbadense in selected pre-mirnas and putative target genes.

RESULTS
strategies of development markers for mirnas and their target genes
primers were designed for  <dig> pre-mirna sequences and identical primers were eliminated with a nucleotide blast search. finally,  <dig> pairs of pre-mirna primers were obtained . then, these primers were screened using single-stranded conformation polymorphism , of which  <dig> primers yielding  <dig> polymorphic loci. the rate of primer polymorphism was  <dig> %.

a total of  <dig>  primer pairs were obtained for the  <dig>  target genes of the mirnas after eliminating identical primers as described above . of these,  <dig> primer pairs produced  <dig> polymorphic loci after sscp analysis. the rate of primer polymorphism was  <dig> %.

based on mirna-aflp technology, the mirna-srap marker technique was performed to enrich mirna markers. among the  <dig>  mirna-srap primer combinations, ~ <dig> scorable bands per primer combination were typically produced. exceptions were mir319-srap primer combinations which generated only 0– <dig> scorable bands. these results are consistent with those obtained from mirna-based aflp marker techniques  <cit> . fifty-five primers produced  <dig> polymorphic loci , and the rate of primer polymorphism was  <dig> %. no polymorphic amplification products were obtained for mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> when combined with srap primers.

pang et al.  <cit>  explored the possibility of using mirna genes as markers and identified dna sequences of potential pre-mirna. mirna-aflp analysis provides a reliable targeted genotyping strategy to assess genetic diversity among cotton species. the srap primers can target exons and introns respectively and generate polymorphism based them  <cit> ; they also can combine with primers desighed from candidate gene regions, which is also called trap   <cit> . therefore, when primers designed from conservative mirnas and their complementary sequences combining with srap primers, mirnas or their flanking sequences can be amplified. this is a highly effective strategy to examine mirna gene distribution as well as more feasible, simple, and efficient than the mirna-aflp technique with respect to typing mirna markers. also, mirna-srap markers may be functional genes; therefore, the mirna-srap technique has important significance to the study of mirnas.

verification of mirna-srap marker techniques
to verify whether the mirna-srap marker technique reliably amplified mirna sequences, pcr products were cloned and sequenced from a sample of  <dig> random polymorphic mirna-srap primer combinations. then, mirna primers and srap primers were identified as depicted in figure  <dig>  the figure depicts reliably amplified products using the primer combinations instead of amplified products from individual mirna primers or srap primers.

even distribution of mirna markers and preferential distribution of target gene markers in the cotton genome
after linkage analysis,  <dig> of the  <dig> polymorphic loci of pre-mirnas were mapped on  <dig> cotton chromosomes  based on sscp analysis which can discover minor sequence mutations and reveal more polymorphisms to map genes  <cit> . for mirna-based srap markers,  <dig> of the  <dig> polymorphic loci were mapped on  <dig> cotton chromosomes, except for chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  these data suggest that mirna markers are widely distributed on  <dig> chromosomes, except for chr <dig> and chr <dig>  for which no mirna markers were identified. apparently, relatively more loci occurred on chr <dig>  and chr <dig> . thirty-two loci were mapped on  <dig> chromosomes of the at sub-genome, and  <dig> loci were mapped on  <dig> chromosomes of the dt sub-genome . in conclusion, these  <dig> mirna loci were evenly distributed on  <dig> chromosomes, except chr <dig> and chr <dig> 

of the  <dig> polymorphic loci for the putative mirna target genes,  <dig> were mapped on the cotton genome:  <dig> loci were mapped on  <dig> chromosomes of the at sub-genome, and  <dig> loci were mapped on  <dig> chromosomes of the dt sub-genome . overall, unlike mirna markers, target gene markers were preferentially distributed on the dt sub-genome. specifically, chromosomes chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig> and chr <dig> contained a total of  <dig> target gene marker loci, i.e., 30% of the total target gene marker loci. comparatively fewer less loci were on chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig> and chr <dig>  surprisingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> target gene polymorphic loci belonged to target genes from the mir <dig> family, whereas  <dig> loci belonged to  <dig> other mirnas families.

to date, no mirna genes and their target genes have been genetically mapped in cotton. pang et al.  <cit>  developed conserved mirna gene markers and explored the possibility of an mirna-aflp marker technique. then, the amplified products were sequenced and compared for homology using cotton expressed sequence tags. however, genetic mapping of mirna markers has not been reported. thus, mirnas and their target gene markers reported here were genetically mapped in our interspecific g. hirsutum × g. barbadense population. such genetic mapping of a segregating population provided an overview of the chromosomal distribution of mirnas and their target genes in cotton.

network diagram revealed by relationships between mirnas and their target genes
in order to excavate the valuable mirnas and putative targets for further research, mirnas and putative target genes, mapped on the interspecific bc <dig> genetic linkage map, were used to create a network diagram based on their regulatory relationships  by circos . table  <dig> depicts  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> target genes that are contained in this network diagram. some mirnas were associated with more than one target gene, and some target genes were regulated by more than one mirna family. individual mirnas and their target genes are clearly and intuitively depicted in the network diagram . as shown in additional file 7: figure s <dig>  mir <dig> and its target tc <dig> , and mir <dig> and its target tc <dig> were located on the same chromosome . also, mir <dig> and its target tc <dig> were proximal on the same chromosome, separated only by  <dig>  cm; whereas, mir172-me <dig> and its target tc <dig> were separated by  <dig>  cm. mir172-me49b and its target tc <dig> were separated by  <dig>  cm . additional file 7h shows that mir <dig> and its target tc <dig> , and another target tc <dig> , are found on homologous chromosomes . the mir <dig>  and mir396a families  have the same targets as depicted in the network diagram: tc <dig> and tc <dig>  chromosomes on which mir <dig> and mir396a are located are also on homologous chromosomes , and their target, tc <dig>  has two sites. furthermore, tc350055a, located on chr <dig>  and tc350055b, located on chr <dig>  are found on homologous chromosomes. additional file 7: figure s2g depicts the same information: mir196b-me <dig> was located on chr <dig> and mir196b-em <dig> was located on chr <dig>  for mir156c-dx <dig> , its target, tc <dig> was located on chr <dig> and another target tc <dig> was located on chr <dig>  which are homologous chromosomes. additional file 7: figure s2f depicts the location of mir169a  and tc <dig> , which are also located on homologous chromosomes. other mirnas and their target genes were located on different chromosomes.
 <dig> 
linkage map

★: mirna was associated with more than one target on the interspecific bc <dig> linkage map.

▲: target was regulated by more than one mirnas family on the interspecific bc <dig> linkage map.

in our network diagram, the relationship and distribution of mirnas and their putative target genes on the interspecific bc <dig> genetic linkage map are clearly and intuitively revealed. this diagram will facilitate our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and networks for target genes and cell development in cotton. allen et al.  <cit>  stated that plant mirnas are thought to be derived from their target sequences after gene duplication, inverted duplication, and divergence in mirna evolution. additional file 7: figure s <dig> shows that many mirnas and their targets, mirnas with the same target, and targets of the same mirna family were located on homologous chromosomes or the same chromosome. these data are consistent with allen’s published findings  <cit> . other mirnas and their targets did not reside on the same or homologous chromosomes, which may be due to evolutionary mutations or deletions or insufficient marker numbers. it was noteworthy that homologous chromosomes, chr <dig> and chr <dig>  contained more targets and mirrnas as depicted in the network diagram, and this may have implications for future studies of mirnas and their targets.

expression differences between parents by rt-pcr and qrt-pcr
we used rt-pcr analysis to investigate pre-mirnas and their putative target genes during fiber development between g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. a total of  <dig> primer pairs were used for rt-pcr analysis, including  <dig> pre-mirna primers and  <dig> randomly selected target gene primers. twenty-five pre-mirna genes  were expressed in cotton fibers. among them, 88% of these expressed pre-mirnas were significantly different among various stages of fiber development  between emian <dig> and 3– <dig>  ten pre-mirnas had weak or no expression in both emian <dig> and 3– <dig> . furthermore,  <dig> pre-mirnas had similar expression patterns, and  <dig> pre-mirnas had different expression patterns . figure  <dig> also shows that 40% of the pre-mirna genes had higher expression in early ovary development.

regarding target genes,  <dig>  were expressed in cotton fiber . among them,  <dig> were obviously differentially expressed;  <dig> had minor differences; and  <dig> were not different . overall,  <dig> % of the expressed target genes were significantly different at various fiber development stages , when comparing emian <dig> and 3– <dig>  three target genes were weakly expressed or not expressed at all stages in both emian <dig> and 3– <dig> . furthermore,  <dig> target genes had similar expression patterns. of the  <dig> target genes with different expression patterns,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down regulated in 3– <dig>  compared with emian <dig>  to further confirm rt-pcr data, target genes belonging to different categories were randomly chosen for qrt-pcr analysis . consistent results were observed between both rt-pcr and qrt-pcr analyses.

in this study, a diagram was constructed to depict pre-mirnas and their corresponding target genes . additional file 10: figure s <dig> shows that mir156c-dx <dig>  mir472-dt <dig>  and mir482a-dr <dig> were similar with respect to their targets in various fiber development stages of emian <dig>  however, no correlation was observed between pre-mirna and its target expression in various fiber development stages of 3– <dig>  mir157-dt <dig>  mir395a-dt <dig> and mir395a-dt <dig> had contrasting expression tendencies with their targets in various stages of emian <dig>  but no correlation was observed between the expression of pre-mirna and its targets in various fiber development stages of 3– <dig>  mir172-tc <dig>  mir413-aw <dig>  and mir414a-dr <dig> and their targets had similar expression tendencies in various parent stages. mir414d-dw <dig> had contrasting expression tendencies with its targets in various stages of emian <dig> and had similar expression tendencies in various stages of 3– <dig> 

in summary, we report dynamic expression of pre-mirnas and putative target genes at various fiber development stages in g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. most expressed pre-mirnas  and their putative targets  were obviously different with respect to expressions at different stages between the two parents. unique expression patterns of pre-mirnas and their putative targets may be connected with a particular function. we also found that pre-mirna families and their putative targets had correlated expression tendencies in various growth stages, suggesting that mirna genes may regulate target gene expression. however, the biological relevance of this must be investigated further to better understand regulatory mechanisms and the overall network of plant growth control.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, mirnas and target markers were developed. we found that although the primers were specific, pre-mirna primer polymorphisms were low , and target primer polymorphisms were even lower . the  <dig> mirna loci were evenly distributed on  <dig> chromosomes, except chr <dig> and chr <dig>  also,  <dig> target gene loci were preferentially distributed on the dt sub-genome and some chromosomes. genetic mapping in a segregating population provides an opportunity to examine distribution of mirnas and their target genes. a network diagram depicting mirnas and their targets confirmed that plant mirnas may be derived from their target sequences after gene duplication or inverted duplication  <cit> . comparative expression analyses of gossypium hirsutum and g. barbadense revealed that mirnas and their target genes play a role in cotton fiber development.
