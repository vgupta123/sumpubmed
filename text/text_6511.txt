BACKGROUND
in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans the insulin/igf- <dig> and tgf-β signaling pathways co-regulate metabolism, aging, stress tolerance and development  <cit> . harsh environmental conditions  and mutations that reduce the activity of either of these pathways cause lipid accumulation in the adipose tissues, lifespan extension, an enhanced tolerance against heat stress, and a switch in the developmental program from normal reproductive growth to dauer development   <cit> . the membrane bound receptor guanylate cyclase  daf- <dig>  is an upstream regulator of both pathways. it generates the messenger molecule cgmp, which activates the tgf-β ligand daf- <dig> and the insulin/igf- <dig> ligand daf- <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, mutations blocking insulin/igf- <dig> or tgf-β signaling promote dauer development in a temperature-dependent fashion. for example, at 20°c mutant animals defective for daf- <dig>  or daf- <dig> develop as dauer larvae with a relatively moderate penetrance. at 25°c, however, both single mutants develop exclusively as dauer larvae. thus, expression of the daf-c phenotype in daf <dig> and daf <dig> mutants relies on the perception of the ambient temperature. this implies that the effects of nutrient supply, population density and temperature are somehow orchestrated in the animal to influence reproductive growth, longevity, stress resistance and metabolism.

in divergent eukaryotic species, the transcription factor hsf- <dig> adjusts various cellular processes in response to heat stress through initiating a conserved transcriptional program  <cit> . upon temperature increase, hsf- <dig> becomes activated via trimerization and phosphorylation, then translocates into the nucleus to promote the transcription of genes that encode heat shock proteins  such as hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  <cit> . these factors largely contribute to the protection of cells from protein-damaging stress. in c. elegans, insulin/igf- <dig> signaling inhibits hsf- <dig> activity  <cit> ; daf- <dig> was recently shown to inhibit phosphorylation of ddl- <dig>  and ddl- <dig>  two negative regulators of hsf- <dig>  in order to keep hsf- <dig> in an inactive  form  <cit> . when insulin/igf- <dig> signaling is attenuated, hsf- <dig> and the insulin/igf- <dig> signaling target daf-16/foxo  stimulate the expression of genes required for longevity and stress resistance   <cit> . among their common targets, several small heat shock protein encoding genes can be found  <cit> .

RESULTS
hsf- <dig> represses daf- <dig> expression
under favorable conditions, daf-7/tgf-β accumulates in two chemosensory neurons, the asis, to promote reproductive growth cell non-autonomously  <cit> . daf-11/gc activity, which is inhibited by the crowding  pheromone daf- <dig>  leads to daf <dig> upregulation . indeed, an integrated daf7::gfp reporter  showed a strong asi-specific expression in an otherwise wild-type, but only a faint expression in a daf <dig> mutant genetic background . we found that hsf- <dig> function is required for daf <dig> repression in animals defective for daf-11: daf11; hsf <dig> double mutants displayed nearly wild-type  levels of daf <dig> expression . a similar result was observed with variable penetrance in daf <dig> mutant animals depleted for hsf- <dig> . these results suggest that hsf- <dig> mediates the regulatory effect of daf- <dig> on daf <dig> transcription, and that hsf- <dig> represses daf <dig> 

daf <dig> shares many functions with daf <dig> encoding an hsp <dig> chaperone; daf <dig> and daf <dig> have similar epistasis relationships with other genes in the dauer pathway   <cit> . a daf <dig> allele, p <dig>  causes a massive downregulation of daf <dig> expression in the asis. this prompted us to monitor whether inactivation of hsf- <dig> suspends daf <dig> repression in daf <dig> mutants, too. expression of daf <dig> in the daf21; hsf <dig> double mutant genetic background was indeed as strong as in the wild-type background .

to confirm the results above, we assayed dauer formation in daf- <dig> single mutant versus daf-11; hsf- <dig> double mutant animals, and found that hsf- <dig> deficiency strongly suppresses dauer development in daf- <dig> genetic background . thus, hsf- <dig> activity is required for dauer formation in daf- <dig> mutants animal. dauer development in daf- <dig> mutant animals was also blocked by the hsf- <dig> mutation  . daf-11/gc and daf-21/hsp <dig> hence upregulate daf- <dig> through inhibiting its upstream transcriptional repressor, hsf- <dig>  we suggest that hsf- <dig> is a target of cgmp signaling, and links the cgmp and tgf-β pathways in development control.

next, we measured daf- <dig> transcript levels by quantitative rt-pcr. levels of daf- <dig> mrna were reduced by half when animals were grown at 27°c, as compared with those maintained at 20°c . high temperature-induced downregulation of daf- <dig> was abolished by the hsf- <dig> mutation, suggesting that hsf- <dig> mediates the modulatory effect of temperature on daf- <dig> transcription. moreover, hyperactivation of hsf- <dig> decreased daf- <dig> transcriptional activity by half at 20°c . these data imply that daf- <dig> and daf- <dig> negatively regulate hsf- <dig>  whose activity in turn represses daf- <dig> expression .

as hsf- <dig> acts as a transcription factor, we next asked whether it directly influences daf <dig> activity. our genome-wide sequence analysis identified a canonical hsf- <dig> binding site  in the regulatory region of daf <dig>   <dig> base pairs  upstream of the atg translational initiation site  . this site is highly conserved in the daf <dig> genomic region of closely related caenorhabditis species . we generated a transcriptional fusion daf7::gfp  reporter and a mutated version of this reporter in which  <dig> critical bases were removed from the canonical hsf- <dig> binding site  . both reporters were strongly expressed in the asis . however, while the wild-type reporter was downregulated in daf <dig> single mutants and remained strong in daf11; hsf <dig> double mutants, expression of the mutant reporter was not significantly changed upon daf- <dig> deficiency . these results provide an in vivo evidence for the functionality of this particular hsf- <dig> binding site in the daf <dig> promoter. we conclude that hsf- <dig> acts together with daf- <dig>  daf- <dig> and daf- <dig> along the same signaling axis to control reproductive growth. in this cascade daf- <dig> and daf- <dig> inhibit hsf- <dig>  thereby stimulating daf <dig> expression. under dauer-inducing conditions, hsf- <dig> becomes active and represses daf <dig>  this epistasis model  may explain why nematodes can develop as dauer larvae at 27°c even when they are well-fed and propagated at a low population density  <cit> .

hsf- <dig> also acts downstream of daf-7/tgf-β to regulate aging and development
tgf-β signaling influences longevity via the insulin/igf- <dig> signaling pathway; loss-of-function mutations in daf <dig> and daf <dig>  can double the animal’s natural lifespan and this longevity effect requires daf- <dig> activity  <cit> . signaling through daf- <dig> negatively regulates the smad-like transcriptional cofactor daf- <dig> . in the absence of daf- <dig> activity, daf- <dig> inhibits certain insulin-like peptides and upregulates other insulin-like peptides  to decrease daf-2/igf- <dig> function and extend lifespan  <cit> . as hsf- <dig> is required for longevity in insulin/igf- <dig> signaling deficient animals  <cit> , we hypothesized that it mediates lifespan extension in daf <dig> mutants as well. indeed, the long-lived phenotype of daf <dig> mutant animals was strongly, but not completely, suppressed by the hsf <dig> mutation . daf7; hsf <dig> double mutants lived nearly as short as hsf <dig> single mutants. this raises the possibility that hsf- <dig> functions downstream of daf- <dig> in ageing control. it is worth to note that the incomplete suppression of longevity in daf <dig> mutants by the hsf <dig> mutation may result from the fact that sy <dig> represents a hypomorphic, and not a genetic null, allele.

dauer formation in daf <dig> null mutant animals correlates with the ambient temperature: the higher the temperature is between 15-25°c, the larger proportion of the population enters the dauer diapause  <cit> . this phenomenon prompted us to examine whether dysregulation of hsf- <dig> modulates the ability of these mutants to develop as dauer larvae. we found that inactivation of hsf- <dig> increases, while its hyperactivation decreases the penetrance of the daf-c phenotype of daf- <dig> deficient animals . a series of daf <dig> mutant alleles, including e <dig>  ok <dig> and m <dig>  exhibited an hsf-1-dependent ability to induce dauer development at 20°c. these results imply that hsf- <dig> acts both upstream and downstream of daf- <dig> to modulate the developmental choice between reproductive growth and dauer formation. first, it promotes dauer development by acting downstream of daf <dig> and daf <dig> to repress daf <dig> expression . thus, hsf <dig> functions between daf11/daf <dig> and daf <dig> in the genetic  pathway that regulates dauer development. second, hsf- <dig> inhibits dauer development through interacting with  downstream component of the tgf-β pathway . interestingly, a previous study also reported that depletion of hsf- <dig> significantly modulates the percentage of dauer larvae in daf <dig> mutant populations  <cit> . however, the authors showed that rnai-mediated knockdown of hsf- <dig> suppresses, rather than enhances , the daf-c phenotype of daf <dig> mutant animals. this discrepancy may result from specific rnai conditions used in that early study. for example, daf <dig> mutants  maintained at 25°c could enter the dauer stage with only 20%, although numerous other studies reported that these mutant animals develop as dauer larvae exclusively under identical conditions.

hsf- <dig> upregulates daf-9/cytochrome p450
our data above indicate that hsf- <dig> may control the expression of a tgf-β component that functions downstream of daf- <dig> to affect development. a good candidate for this component is daf <dig> that codes for a cytochrome p <dig>  <cit> . the cytochrome p <dig> superfamily of enzymes is involved in the metabolism of a large number of organic substances, including synthesis and breakdown of steroid hormones. daf- <dig> modulates the activity of the tgf-β dauer formation pathway by inhibiting the nuclear hormone receptor daf- <dig> . interestingly, daf <dig>  which determines two daf- <dig> isoforms, is known to be expressed in the hypodermis at early larval stages in a temperature dependent manner   <cit> . consistent with these results, further sequence analysis identified a conserved hsf- <dig> binding site in the second intron of daf <dig>  which actually is located in the upstream regulatory region of the shorter daf <dig> isoform . this conserved site is also present in the c. briggsae and c. remanei daf <dig> loci . a daf9::gfp reporter system  containing this potential hsf- <dig> binding element displayed a faint hypodermal expression in wild-type, but a strong activity in daf <dig> mutant background  . upregulation of daf <dig> in daf <dig> mutant animals was, however, suppressed by the hsf <dig> mutation, suggesting that hsf- <dig> mediates temperature-induced stimulation of daf <dig>  as daf- <dig> accumulates in certain amphid neurons in the head, its negative regulatory effect on the hypodermal daf <dig> expression should occur cell non-autonomously. together, daf <dig> may serve as another transcriptional target for hsf- <dig>  and hsf- <dig> modulates the effect of tgf-β signaling on larval development at multiple points.

daf-2/igf- <dig> promotes daf- <dig> expression via inhibition of hsf-1
insulin/igf- <dig> signaling inhibits hsf- <dig> through modulating the phosphorylation status, and thereby the activity, of the hsf- <dig> regulator ddl-1/ <dig> proteins  <cit> . this interaction raises the possibility that daf- <dig> also promotes daf <dig> expression via hsf- <dig> . to address this issue we first assayed daf <dig> expression in daf <dig> mutant dauer larvae . in these animals, daf <dig> was expressed in the asis at relatively low levels. in contrast, impairment of hsf- <dig> function strongly induced daf <dig> expression in the asis and caused a strong ectopic daf <dig> expression in neurons of the ventral nerve cord . excessive and ectopic expression of daf <dig> was obvious in each hsf <dig> mutant dauer larva examined. we next analyzed daf <dig> activity in wild-type versus daf <dig> mutant background at the l <dig> stage, and found that daf <dig> expression is downregulated upon daf- <dig> deficiency . although a reduction in gfp glowing was evident in daf <dig> mutant l <dig> larvae, this expressional change was less robust than in daf <dig> mutant l <dig> larvae. based on these data one can speculate that daf- <dig> only reduces, but does not completely eliminate hsf- <dig> activity. we also tested the modulatory effect of hsf <dig> mutation on daf <dig> expression in daf <dig> mutant background. expression levels of daf <dig> in daf2; hsf <dig> double mutants were as nearly strong as in the wild-type background . this suggests that hsf- <dig> mediates—via two sequential inhibitory steps—stimulation of daf <dig> by daf- <dig> . accordingly, the proportion of dauer larvae in daf <dig> mutant populations maintained at 20-23°c was significantly enhanced by hsf- <dig> hyperactivity . in accordance with previously published data  <cit> , these results point to a regulatory link through which nutritional status of the animal can influence developmental decision between normal reproductive growth and dauer larva formation in a temperature-dependent fashion .

hsf- <dig> promotes reproductive growth
the c. elegans genome encodes an hsf- <dig> paralog, hsf- <dig> . hsf- <dig>  is predicted to be composed of  <dig> exons . tm <dig> is a deletion allele of hsf- <dig> which removes nearly  <dig> bp of upstream regulatory sequences and most part of the first exon. hsf- <dig> mutant hermaphrodites were backcrossed with wild-type males  <dig> times, and then subjected to a phenotypic characterization at  <dig> and 27°c. according to our data, the vast majority of hsf- <dig> mutant l <dig> larvae developed into adulthood at both temperatures, i.e. they did not exhibited a high temperature-induced dauer formation constitutive  phenotype. next, we generated an hsf-2; daf- <dig> double mutant strain, and found a significant increase in dauer larva formation in these animals, as compared with daf- <dig> single mutants . thus, unlike hsf- <dig>  hsf- <dig> inhibits dauer development. since we do not know whether hsf- <dig> also functions as a transcription factor, further experiments are needed to clarify the molecular nature of this inhibition.

inhibitory mutations in unc <dig>  and unc <dig> cause a hid phenotype: the mutant animals do not form dauers at 25°c, but develop as dauer larvae at 27°c  <cit> . unc- <dig> and unc- <dig> function upstream of the insulin/igf- <dig> and tgf-β signaling pathways, respectively. we assessed whether the hsf <dig> mutation affects dauer formation in unc <dig> and unc <dig> mutant animals . the tm <dig> allele had no influence on dauer development in unc <dig> mutants, but significantly increased the ability of unc <dig> mutant animals to enter the dauer stage. this synergism suggests that hsf <dig> acts in parallel to unc <dig>  probably upstream of unc <dig>  to promote dauer development . at the moment, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that hsf <dig> may function upstream of daf <dig> . further epistasis analysis combining hsf <dig> with ins, daf <dig> and daf <dig> mutations would be required to place hsf <dig> unambiguously in this signaling network.

discussion
most of the hsf- <dig> targets identified so far encode heat shock proteins protecting cells from protein-damaging agents  <cit> . a few examples where hsf- <dig> transcriptionally represses non-heat shock proteins were also reported  <cit> . in this study we identified two c. elegans tgf-β pathway-related genes, daf7/tgf-β and daf9/cytochrome p <dig>  whose regulatory regions contain a conserved binding site for hsf- <dig> , and whose expression highly depends on hsf- <dig> activity . daf <dig> and daf <dig> are likely to be under the direct control of hsf- <dig>  daf <dig> expression is repressed, while daf <dig> expression is upregulated, by hsf- <dig>  resulting in opposite effects on dauer formation. the overall impact of  hsf- <dig> activity on this developmental choice  is to promote dauer development in the wild type at high temperatures  with only a moderate percentage. consistent with these results, another cytochrome p <dig> encoding gene, cyp35b1/dod <dig>  was recently identified as a hsf- <dig> target gene  <cit> . hsf- <dig> also upregulates cyp35b1/dod <dig> expression in intestinal cells  <cit> . taken together, our present results further suggest that the hsf-1-initiated transcriptional program involves up- and downregulation of “metabolic” genes, the protein products of which have no chaperone function. rather, these proteins operate as key components of signal transduction pathways implicated in metabolism, development and lifespan control. in the light of these data, one can mechanistically explain how upshift in the ambient temperature affects—in addition to protein homeostasis—diverse cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, fat metabolism, differentiation and aging. nevertheless, once the developmental decision favoring dauer larva formation is made, several hsp genes become also upregulated by hsf- <dig>  and their products contribute to increased stress resistance in the animal.

our data presented here indicate that hsf- <dig> represses daf- <dig> through a direct transcriptional interaction . daf- <dig> codes for a tgf-β ligand that activates the tgf-β signaling axis promoting reproductive growth. daf- <dig> regulation by hsf- <dig> elucidates why nematodes can enter into the dauer stage at high  temperature even when they are well-fed and not crowded. moreover, hsf- <dig> activity is influenced by the receptors daf- <dig> and daf- <dig> . daf- <dig> is responsive to concentration of the dauer pheromone , while daf- <dig> senses the animal’s nutritional status. nematodes deficient in either of these proteins form dauer larvae and age in a temperature-dependent manner. for example, daf- <dig> mutant animals develop reproductively at 15°c, but develop as dauer larvae at 25°c. more significantly, daf- <dig> mutants that reach the adulthood live much longer at 15°c than at 25°c. thus, a complex regulatory interaction mediated by hsf- <dig> among the tgf-β, guanylate cyclase/cgmp and insulin/igf- <dig> signaling systems exists to affect development and lifespan in response to various environmental factors, including population density, nutrient availability and temperature.

hsf- <dig> stimulates daf9/cytochrome p <dig> activity , implying that it acts both upstream and downstream of daf- <dig> to control nematode development . daf <dig> repression by hsf- <dig> promotes, while daf <dig> upregulation by hsf- <dig> suppresses dauer formation under a given condition. why is a dual function of hsf- <dig> needed for dauer formation control? at 27°c, only a minor portion  of c. elegans populations enters the dauer stage  <cit> . without stimulating daf <dig> activity, hsf- <dig> would completely inhibit reproductive growth. actually, this occurs in sensitized  mutant genetic backgrounds. since in the temperate and tropical zones the temperature is often above 27°c, nematode populations would frequently exist as non-reproducing dauer larvae under these conditions. this way, hsf- <dig> regulates both a dauer-inhibiting  and a dauer-inducing  tgf-β pathway component in order to allow the populations to survive  and propagate  simultaneously under environmental stress, thereby maximizing the chance of the population to survive.

finally, here we revealed that hsf- <dig> mediates the regulatory effect of daf- <dig> on c. elegans development. daf- <dig> is a receptor guanylate cyclase that is implicated in chemosensation and behavior  <cit> . interestingly, several behavioral patterns in various animal species depend on the ambient temperature. our present finding that guanylate cyclase acts through hsf- <dig> in controlling c. elegans dauer formation may help to understand how heat stress, food deprivation or crowding also affects behavior in humans.

CONCLUSIONS
fundamental insights into how genes and environmental factors influence metazoan metabolism, development and aging have emerged from a genetic dissection of the c. elegans dauer diapause, which is an arrested , long-lived, and highly stress-resistant larval form triggered by starvation and crowding. identified molecular pathways that regulate the developmental choice between reproductive growth and dauer larva formation include the insulin/igf- <dig>  tgf-β and guanylate cyclase/cgmp neuroendocrine systems. here we show that heat shock factor- <dig> , a major player in cellular response to heat stress, intertwines these signaling systems in development and aging control. under adverse environmental conditions hsf- <dig> promotes dauer larva development through repression of daf- <dig>  which encodes a tgf-β ligand. when conditions are favorable, hsf- <dig> is inhibited by crowding pheromone-sensitive guanylate cyclase/cgmp and systemic nutrient-sensing insulin/igf- <dig> signaling; loss of hsf- <dig> activity allows daf- <dig> to induce reproductive growth. these results provide mechanistic insight into how temperature, nutrient availability and hormonal factors coordinately influence development, stress response, behavior and lifespan through hsf- <dig>  in humans, an orthologous hsf-1-mediated signaling system may be dysregulated in diabetes, cancer and obesity.
