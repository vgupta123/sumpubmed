BACKGROUND
cggbp <dig> is a dna-binding, transcription regulatory protein shown to have binding sites on cgg tandem repeats as well as repetitive clusters of ribosomal rna genes  <cit> . the cpg-richness of cggbp1-binding sequences raises the question whether cpg methylation may be a mechanism underlying transcription-regulation by cggbp <dig>  despite evidence of transcriptional silencing by binding of cggbp <dig> to unmethylated cgg repeats  <cit> , the effects of cggbp <dig> on cpg methylation have never been studied. recently cggbp1-binding was demonstrated at repetitive dna including transcription-regulatory regions of alu-sines and l1-lines  <cit> . cggbp <dig> acts as a growth-specific transcription suppressor of a subset of alu-sines  <cit> . unlike the gene-rich regions, the repetitive dna e.g. peri-centromeric, sub-telomeric and satellite repeats as well as interspersed repeats, including alu and line- <dig> elements carry high methylation levels  <cit> .

methylation of cytosine bases on dna is a pivotal epigenetic mark important for development and differentiation  <cit>  and importantly also required for suppression of transcription of repetitive elements in the genome  <cit> . cytosine methylation has been most studied in the cpg context, although it also occurs in chg and chh contexts  <cit> .

dna methyltransferases either methylate cytosine bases de novo   <cit>  or at hemi-methylated sites during replication   <cit> , although context-specific de novo methylation by dnmt <dig> has been reported  <cit> . suv39h, hdacs, hmts, prb, p <dig>  dmap <dig>  pcna and mbd <dig> are some proteins that regulate activities of dnmts  <cit> . of these, all except hdacs and prb, are positive effectors of their activities and cytosine methylation. erasure of cpg cytosine methylation involves oxidation and deamination of methylated cytosine by tet and aicda proteins respectively followed by base-excision repair based on the complementary guanidine  <cit> . an interplay between positive and negative effectors of cpg methylation makes sure that even within the constitutive heterochromatin, cytosine methylation may not be 100% and an equilibrium between unmethylated and methylated cytosine bases is maintained. the factors restricting cpg methylation from invading all cytosine bases remains largely unknown. unraveling the function of potential novel regulators of cytosine methylation such as cggbp <dig> thus becomes important.

RESULTS
to elucidate the role of cggbp <dig> in regulation of cpg methylation we performed global as well as targeted  methylation analysis of genomic dna from normal human fibroblasts after an acute depletion of cggbp <dig> 

1064sk cells were transduced with control or cggbp1-targeting shmir-lentiviruses and cggbp1-depletion was confirmed by western blotting . genomic dna was extracted and used for methylation analysis by colorimetry using antibody directed against methyl-cytosine . the results showed that cytosine methylation was increased upon cggbp <dig> depletion .figure  <dig> global methylation changes upon cggbp1-depletion. a: colorimetric analysis reveals an increase in cpg methylation. y-axis shows colorimetry signal from  <dig> independent assays . b: genespring output showing changes in cpg methylation. the increase in methylation is significant between cggbp1-depleted and control samples. y-axis shows c count . c: frequency plotting of cpg methylation changes across different ranges of methylation. this plot shows binning of data depicted in 1b. x-axis shows methylation frequency bins and y-axis shows c count .



then, paired-end sequencing was performed for the control and cggbp1-depleted dna after bisulfite treatment. the reads were mapped  using bismark  <cit>  and the data further analyzed using genespring v <dig> . <dig> . for bisulfite treatment, 100% unmethylated phage lambda dna was used as spike-in control and bisulfite conversion efficiency in both samples was ascertained as 95% . since bisulfite treatment converts unmethylated cytosine bases to uracil , an increase in cytosine content  upon bisulfite treatment becomes a measure of methylated cytosine bases.

supporting the colorimetry results, the bisulfite-treatment-sequencing experiment also showed increased cytosine content in cggbp1-depleted cells in cpg context . the ratio of methylated cpg to unmethylated cpg increased from  <dig>  in control to  <dig>  in cggbp <dig> depleted sample . this showed that acute cggbp1-depletion increased cpg methylation. the significance of increase in cpg methylation has been calculated using fisher’s exact test  inbuilt in genespring.

a distribution of c% content with respect to methylation% showed that this increase in cpg methylation upon cggbp1-depletion was maximal at highly methylated regions exhibiting 70%–90% methylation . this indicated that upon cggbp <dig> depletion unmethylated regions did not become aberrantly methylated, rather already significantly methylated regions became slightly but significantly hypermethylated.

to ensure that  the small yet significant increases in methylation measured in terms of c count was not due to any base composition bias between the control and cggbp1-depleted dna samples, and  that the changes in c count were indeed due to bisulfite conversion, we next performed illumina paired-end sequencing without any bisulfite treatment on the same samples as used for sequencing after bisulfite conversion . the c count was found to be unaffected by cggbp1-depletion in the absence of bisulfite conversion ) but was significantly  increased by cggbp1-depletion in presence of bisulfite conversion ). also, specifically in bisulfite-converted dna, the relative changes in c counts  were associated with inverse and significant changes in t counts  when cggbp1-shmir samples were compared against control shmir with the latter values normalized to  <dig> ). these results confirmed that the c count increase observed upon bisulfite-treatment-sequencing in cggbp1-depleted sample was genuinely due to increased cytosine methylation.

region annotation of cytosine bases exhibiting increased methylation showed that >99% of them were located in inter-genic regions . the repetitive dna sequences are silenced by methylation and cggbp <dig> is a repeat-binding protein with affinity for unmethylated dna. so we asked if the increase in methylation upon cggbp1-depletion occurs at repetitive dna. non-overlapping sequences of − <dig> to +100 bps regions flanking the methylated cytosine bases were extracted and subjected to repeat identification by repeatmasker  <cit> . a substantial fraction of the differentially methylated regions were located in repetitive regions of the genome as mentioned below: interspersed repeats , small rna , simple repeats  and satellite repeats  . cggbp <dig> depletion thus seemed to increase cytosine methylation at repetitive dna in the inter-genic regions.

alu and line- <dig> repeats constitute a major fraction of interspersed repeats in our genome. they are silenced by cpg methylation and thus also serve as major cytosine methylation repositories. also, alu-sines and l1-lines have been recently shown to be major cggbp1-binding sites  <cit> . to identify the changes in methylation occurring at alu and line- <dig> repeats upon cggbp1-depletion, we established pcr conditions to amplify alu and line- <dig> repeats genome-wide from bisulfite-converted dna . by this approach we could measure global changes in alu and line- <dig> methylation on all cytosine residues in a 220 bp alu amplicon and a 429 bp line- <dig> amplicon  . the alu and line- <dig> bisulfite pcr products were sequenced on pacbio platform and analyzed to reveal any changes in cpg methylation. the alu pcr products showed some concatenation in sequencing library preparation but since the methylation change was being calculated as a drift from c to t, this did not affect the results. the mean ± s.d. lengths of the control shmir and cggbp <dig> shmir line- <dig> pcr products were heavily centered around the expected full-length amplicon . sequences for the entire length of amplicon for all fragments were not achieved, so we included in our analysis only sequences, which were at least  <dig> bases long. out of > <dig> alu sequences per sample and > <dig> line- <dig> sequences per sample, there were no duplicates, showing that the pcr product indeed amplified from different alu and line- <dig> elements genome-wide. the alignment of the individual sequences against consensus alu and line- <dig> sequences are shown in the files submitted to ncbi geo database .

the level of methylation of cpg dinucleotides in this case was measured as the frequency of cpg. the mean cpg methylation on alus was significantly increased . although there was an increase in alu methylation overall, an inspection of the distribution of methylation frequencies indicated two different directions of methylation change. a major fraction had increased  methylation and a minor fraction had decreased  methylation  in the cggbp <dig> shmir sample, the deviation of <8% and >12% fractions from expected  was highly significant . plotting only the sequences having cpg methylation <8% and >12% further highlighted the possible bidirectional change in alu methylation . a frequency plot of alu methylation <8% and >12% subjected to best distribution fit identified a sum-of-two-gaussians clearly in cggbp1-depleted sample but only a major single gaussian distribution in control sample . that the changes in cpg content indeed occurred due to bisulfite treatment was confirmed because the changes in cpg content correlated inversely with changes in tpg content as bisulfite treatment causes a c- > t drift  .figure  <dig> alu and line- <dig> repeats exhibit methylation changes upon cggbp1-depletion. a: mean methylation increase on alu repeats measured by cg frequency per pcr product sequence. y-axis shows nucleotide frequency calculated per sequence. x-axis shows the samples and treatments. b: frequency distribution of alu methylation across different ranges shows decrease  and increase  at extremes in cggbp <dig> shmir sample as compared to control shmir sample. y-axis shows relative frequencies of cg . c: plotting of the >12% and <8% methylation subset from b shows the tailing of differentially methylated sequences at both extremes clearly. d: frequency plot of data plotted in c and best curve fit shows sum-of-two-gaussian fit for cggbp1-depleted sample and a single gaussian distribution for control sample suggesting that indeed there are two groups of methylation levels for alus in cggbp <dig> shmir but only one group of methylation level in control shmir sample. e and f: increase in cpg content negatively correlated with tpg frequency in both samples establishing the fact that the changes in cytosine content was indeed due to bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosines. g: increase in methylation on line- <dig> elements was significant with no bidirectional heterogeneity as seen for the alus. h: frequency plotting showed that < <dig> %  methylation was prevalent in control sample, but > <dig> % methylation was prevalent in cggbp1-depleted sample . i and j: cpg and tpg frequencies on line- <dig> exhibited inverse correlations in cggbp <dig> and control shmir samples establishing the fact that the changes in cytosine content was indeed due to bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosines.



cpg methylation on line- <dig> also showed a significant increase after cggbp1-depletion . the control samples had higher content of < <dig> % methylated line- <dig> elements, whereas the population of > <dig> % methylated line- <dig> repeats increased in cggbp1-depleted sample  . by plotting the cpg content against tpg content on the line- <dig> repeats, again we found a strong inverse correlation, confirming that the increase in cpg content indeed occurs due to methylation  . since a fraction of the tpg content is a part of the native sequence of alu and line- <dig> elements which does not arise out of c- > t conversion, the observed inverse correlation between the cpg and tpg may actually underrepresent the true inverse correlation between methylated cpg versus bisulfite conversion-derived tpg.

discussion
to unravel the possibility that cggbp <dig> with target sites at cpg-rich sequences may also function as a possible mediator of cpg methylation we performed global and targeted methylation analysis of genomic dna from normal human fibroblasts after an acute depletion of cggbp <dig>  the results from these experiments now clearly show that cggbp <dig> is a net negative regulator of cpg methylation. the regions most affected by cggbp1-dependent methylation regulation are inter-genic regions including simple repeats, satellite dna and interspersed repeats. an in-depth nucleotide level analysis of the methylation changes at discrete cpg nucleotides will generate more information about the dna sequence context in which cggbp <dig> targets methylation at cpg sites. although cgg repeats constitute a major binding site for cggbp <dig>  there are cgg-free regions to which it binds. these include cdkn1a promoter  <cit> , telomeric repeats  <cit> , a cgg repeat-free snp rs11597367*g  <cit>  and alu and line promoters in addition to other repetitive elements in the genome  <cit> . thus the effect of cggbp <dig> depletion on methylation at cgg repeat-free regions is not surprising.

targeted analysis of methylation on alu and line- <dig> repeats genome-wide upon cggbp1-depletion and demonstrated an increase in cpg methylation. these regions are usually constitutively inactivated by, and carry a major fraction of, cpg methylation. obviously these regions are under constant influence of mechanisms that ensure high levels of methylation. this would include constant surveillance by dna methyltransferases as well as constitutive heterochromatin-associated histone modifiers. since cytosine methylation erasure mechanisms, including oxidation, deamination and subsequent base excision processes, would counteract methylation at these repetitive regions, they may not be 100% methylated at any particular time point. the mechanism underlying methylation increase upon cggbp1-depletion may either involve an increase of de novo methylation, or a decrease of methylation erasure, or both combined. given the already high methylation levels at repetitive regions, a further augmentation of de novo methyltransferases activity at these elements is difficult to comprehend. therefore the possibility that cggbp <dig> depletion mitigates methylation erasure appears more likely. an analysis of the recently published gene expression profile of cggbp1-depleted cells supports our current findings. from this dataset, an identification of expression profiles of genes with known functions in cytosine methylation regulation showed that cggbp1-depletion decreases the expression of genes involved in cytosine/methyl-cytosine oxidation  and increases the expression of positive effectors of cpg methylation including dnmt <dig> . alternatively, since cggbp <dig> has affinity for unmethylated repetitive dna  <cit>  it is possible that cggbp <dig> shields sub-regions of repetitive dna from de novo methyltransferases activity. down regulation of cggbp <dig> will then expose these regions to methylation-incorporating machinery. this would result in methylation increase, as observed in the present investigation.

interestingly, even if cggbp <dig> depletion increases cytosine methylation, it does so not at unmethylated regions or regions with very low cytosine methylation , rather at already significantly methylated repetitive dna regions. a decrease in methylation at repetitive dna or an increase in methylation at cpg islands could be high in magnitude, but a further increase in methylation at already highly methylated regions can only be limited. this may explain the only low but highly significant changes in methylation levels observed upon cggbp <dig> depletion.

the possibility of bidirectional change in alu cpg methylation suggests that different alu elements may be subjected to different mechanisms of cpg methylation regulation by cggbp <dig>  further work is needed to identify which kinds of alu elements exhibit decreased methylation upon cggbp1-depletion. a classification of alu sequences obtained in the current work into different sub-families is not possible due to two factors:  generation of chimeric alu sequences in pcr due to annealing and cross-amplification of highly similar alu sequences belonging to different subfamilies, and  site-specific c- > t variations could not be identified as differences in original genomic dna or as occurring due to bisulfite conversion. although the primers were intended to be selected from as highly conserved regions of alus as possible, it is important to note that due to sequence variations between different alu elements, there could be a minor pcr amplification bias against the alu elements which do not match completely with the primer sequences or have unmethylated cpg dinucleotides in the priming region.

the approach employed in this study to study genome-wide methylation changes upon cggbp <dig> depletion measures the overall changes in cytosine methylation without giving a microscopic base-level information about the methylation targets of cggbp <dig>  these data give a sound platform to build upon to uncover the sequence contexts in which cggbp <dig> exerts methylation regulation at specific sites.

though several positive effectors of dna methylation are known, to the best of our knowledge, apart from histone-modifying proteins hdacs and hmts and prb, this is the first factor described to have negative effects on cytosine methylation. we therefore have discovered a unique feature of cggbp <dig> that is important for regulation of dna methylation. this has implications on silencing of alu and line- <dig> repeats, heterochromatin formation on simple and satellite repeats and hence on genome integrity and function.

CONCLUSIONS
cggbp <dig> depletion results in increased cpg methylation at repetitive dna sequences. these include alu-sines and l1-lines. a subset of alu-sines however display decreased methylation suggesting a bi-directionality in the effects of cggbp <dig> on cpg methylation on alu-sines. gene expression data suggest that a transcriptional deregulation of cpg methylation-regulatory genes could underlie this effect of cggbp <dig>
