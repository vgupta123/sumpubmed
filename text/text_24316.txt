BACKGROUND
fully grown immature mammalian oocytes are arrested at the diplotene stage of meiotic prophase i. oocyte maturation is initiated in vivo when the mural granulosa cells respond to the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge, or in vitro when oocytes are isolated from follicles  <cit> . germinal vesicle breakdown  marks the onset of nuclear maturation, which progresses into formation of the first metaphase spindle, followed by extrusion of the first polar body and formation of the second metaphase spindle. at metaphase ii, oocytes enter a second period of meiotic arrest, which is maintained until fertilization. meiosis resumption is often characterized by the occurrence of gvbd, since this is the first clear morphological event that takes place after release from meiotic inhibition. however, extensive rearrangements of components within the ooplasm, known as cytoplasmic maturation  <cit> , already start to occur prior to gvbd  <cit> .

cytoplasmic maturation includes dynamic changes in the distribution and integrity of the golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . in somatic cells, the golgi apparatus is fragmented at the onset of mitosis and starts to reform at telophase  <cit> . two distinct views on the mechanism of golgi partitioning during mitotis have been proposed  <cit> . one view holds that association of golgi fragments with the metaphase spindle allows equal partitioning of golgi components into the two daughter cells  <cit> . the second view is based on the idea of a dynamic golgi apparatus, in which golgi proteins continuously cycle through the er. coat protein ii -coated vesicles that traffic from er to golgi originate at subdomains of the er, known as er exit sites . vesicle formation at eres is inhibited during mitosis as a consequence of which cycling golgi proteins become trapped in the er  <cit> . golgi components are then equally distributed into daughter cells together with the er and the golgi is reformed from vesicles that form at eres when the er export block is lifted at telophase  <cit> . although the general distribution of er during oocyte maturation has been studied extensively  <cit> , a function for eres during oocyte maturation remains to be elucidated. evidence for a role of either of these two mechanisms in the control of golgi dynamics during oocyte meiosis is lacking. it is clear that cytoplasmic processes constitute an integral part of both mitosis and meiosis, and we therefore use the term 'meiosis resumption' to indicate the moment when the first rearrangement of components occurs within the oocyte in response to release from the inhibitory influence of the follicular environment.

in most cells, cell division cycle  <dig>  complexes with cyclin b to form m-phase promoting factor , a well known central regulator of both mitotic and meiotic events. mpf regulates chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and formation of metaphase spindles in both somatic cells and oocytes, whereas transition from metaphase to anaphase requires inactivation of mpf  <cit> . in mitotic cells, disassembly of golgi and eres are regulated by cdc <dig> through phosphorylation of gm <dig> and p <dig>  respectively  <cit> . despite the similarities in cdc <dig> functions during mitosis and meiosis, it is unclear whether the activity of cdc <dig> exerts a similarly stringent control over the integrity of the golgi apparatus and eres in oocytes as it does in mitotic cells.

the activity of cdc <dig> during the meiotic divisions of porcine oocytes is known to be controlled by at least two regulatory proteins, i.e. cyclin b and speedy   <cit> . spdy proteins have no homology to cyclins, but are potent activators of cdc <dig> during early phases of oocyte maturation  <cit> . cdc <dig> activity can alternatively be controlled through phosphorylation of specific residues. compared to the cdc2/cyclin b complex, the activity of cdc <dig> when complexed with spdy is less sensitive to phosphorylation  <cit> . finally, cdc <dig> activity may be regulated by changing the subcellular distribution of cdc <dig> and/or its regulators  <cit> : sequestration of cdc <dig> to subcellular domains may prevent cdc <dig> from phosphorylating specific substrates or limit access of regulatory proteins to cdc <dig>  conversely, concentration of cdc <dig> at subcellular 'foci', such as the golgi or eres, could confer spatio-temporal specificity to cdc <dig> function.

to establish the role of the subcellular distribution of cdc <dig>  and its regulatory proteins cyclin b and spdy, in the regulation of early oocyte maturation, we examined their localization and the distribution of cell organelles containing potential cdc <dig> target proteins during pig oocyte maturation. the localization of these organelles was investigated using antibodies raised against the eres marker sec <dig>  the golgi marker gm <dig>  and phosphorylated gm <dig> , a marker for fragmented golgi. our results demonstrate that cdc <dig> transiently associates with a p-gm130-labeled structure in the cortex of maturing porcine oocytes prior to gvbd. using the eres marker sec <dig>  we show that this structure consists of a cluster of eres. furthermore, our data on the distribution of cdc <dig> and its regulatory protein spdy in oocytes suggest a role for the cdc2/spdy complex in regulation of secretion during oocyte maturation.

RESULTS
cdc <dig> accumulates in a single cortical structure in gv stage oocytes
to determine the subcellular distribution of cdc <dig>  oocytes were fixed after  <dig> or  <dig> h of in vitro maturation , immuno-labeled and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. at  <dig> h, we observed a single large cdc2-containing cytoplasmic structure in the cortex of ~25% of gv oocytes . high magnification images showed that this cdc2-positive structure was composed of clustered smaller units . additionally, ~35% of oocytes displayed cdc <dig> staining in the gv , a pattern that rarely coincided with staining in a cortical structure. staining with an anti-pstair antibody , which recognizes the cyclin-binding domain that is conserved in all cdks, including cdc <dig>  <cit> , showed a morphologically identical structure. as could be expected from a broader specificity, pstair-reactive antibodies also labeled other intracellular areas, e.g. cytoplasmic areas near the gv at the plasma membrane of the oocyte . labeling with control igg from pre-immune serum revealed sporadic non-specific small puncta . specificity of the cdc <dig> and pstair directed antibodies was further supported by immunoblotting, which revealed a single specific band at the expected  <dig> kda molecular weight in oocyte and hela cell lysates. little if any cdc <dig> and pstair could be detected in the cumulus cells isolated from cumulus-oocyte complexes, which is probably due to low mitotic activity of these cells .

the rate of oocyte maturation in our experimental system was consistent with those previously reported in ivm studies using similar maturation conditions  <cit> : all oocytes were in gv stage directly after isolation ; after  <dig> h of culture ,  <dig> ± 5% of oocytes were still in gv, while  <dig> ± 5% had progressed to mi or mii; after  <dig> h of maturation ,  <dig> ± 4% of oocytes were in mii stage. the association of cdc <dig> with the cortical structure depended on the state of oocyte maturation, since the percentage of gv oocytes containing a cdc2-labeled structure was significantly reduced from  <dig> ± 2% at  <dig> h to  <dig> ± 6% at  <dig> h of ivm , while this cdc2-labeled structure was not observed in any oocytes that had progressed to mi or mii. taken together, these data demonstrate that cdc <dig> associates with a single cortical structure prior to gvbd and suggest that this association is transient.

cdc <dig> associates with er exit sites
to identify the nature of these cdc2-labeled structures, immature  oocytes were double-labeled for cdc <dig> and several other markers: sec <dig>  gm <dig>  p-gm <dig>  calnexin, gamma-tubulin, nup <dig>  and mitotracker . sec <dig> is a component of the copii complex, which is involved in the formation of transport vesicles at eres. copii-coated vesicles transfer cargo from er to golgi and dissociate their coat after fission from eres. in  <dig> h gv oocytes, half of the cdc2-labeled structures were positive for sec <dig> , identifying them as eres. gm <dig> is a golgi matrix protein. at the onset of mitosis, gm <dig> is phosphorylated by cdc <dig> resulting in fragmentation of the golgi apparatus and redistribution of the gm <dig> protein  <cit> . almost all  cdc2-positive structures in  <dig> h gv oocytes also labeled for p-gm <dig> . calnexin is an er-resident transmembrane protein, that localizes to the rough er, but not to eres  <cit> . accordingly, we observed calnexin in a reticular pattern and at the nuclear envelope in  <dig> h gv oocytes . consistent with its absence at eres, calnexin was not found at cdc2-labeled cortical structures in any of the gv oocytes examined . finally, gamma-tubulin , which localizes to microtubule organizing centers, mitotracker , a marker for mitochondria, and nup <dig> , one of the nuclear pore complex proteins that localizes to the nuclear membrane and to annulate lamellae, were not observed at cdc2-labeled structures. these results indicate that cdc <dig> accumulates in a specialized compartment in the smooth er that comprises eres.

inhibition of meiosis resumption prevents association of cdc <dig> with p-gm130-labeled eres
in our lab, collecting, selecting, and denuding oocytes requires approximately  <dig>  h. although oocytes in our experimental  <dig> h condition are still at the gv stage, they may already have resumed meiosis during this experimental interval. to prevent premature meiosis resumption during oocyte isolation, cumulus-oocyte complexes were collected in the presence of  <dig> μm forskolin  <cit> . forskolin stimulates the activity of adenylate cyclase, thus raising the intracellular camp concentration. under these conditions, oocytes are maintained in prophase i arrest  <cit> . the presence of forskolin during oocyte isolation and denuding significantly reduced the occurrence of cdc2-labeling at the eres cluster in gv stage oocytes , supporting the idea that cdc <dig> is recruited to eres early after meiosis resumption. since maintenance of meiotic arrest by forskolin is reversible  <cit> , oocytes were isolated in the presence of forskolin, and examined at several time points after removal of forskolin from the culture media . the percentage of gv oocytes containing cdc2-labeled eres increased within  <dig> h of chase , followed by a decline to ~10% after  <dig> h of chase. in  <dig> h forskolin treated oocytes, the occurrence of p-gm130-labeled eres equaled that in  <dig> h controls. a gradual decline in the percentage of gv oocytes containing p-gm130-labeled eres was observed after forskolin removal . combined, these results indicate that p-gm <dig> accumulates at eres prior to meiosis resumption, and that cdc <dig> transiently associates with eres just after the oocyte is released from the inhibitory influence of the follicle.

phosphorylated gm <dig> is stored at eres during maturation
given the role of cdc <dig> in phosphorylating the golgi protein gm <dig>  labeling for both gm <dig> and p-gm <dig> should provide information on the role of cdc2-labeled cortical domains in golgi-protein redistribution during meiosis. to establish the distribution of gm <dig> and its phosphorylated form p-gm <dig> during oocyte maturation, oocytes were double-labeled for gm <dig> and p-gm <dig> after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h of ivm. gm <dig> staining revealed an intact golgi apparatus and several gm130-labeled areas in the periphery of  <dig> h gv oocytes, whereas gm <dig> was not detected in cdc2-labeled eres . as maturation progressed, gm <dig> staining in the oocyte was observed in progressively smaller and more dispersed fragments, whereas intact gm130-labeled golgi complexes were observed in the cumulus cells . staining for gm <dig> and p-gm <dig> did not overlap . at the gv stage, p-gm <dig> localized to a cortical domain . p-gm <dig> labeling persisted in the cortical domain in mi and mii stage oocytes, and increased in the er as maturation progressed . no p-gm <dig> staining was detected in the polar body . these data indicate that during oocyte maturation, gm <dig> is stored in the er in its phosphorylated form.

cdc <dig> associates with spdy at eres
the activity of cdc <dig> during cell division has been studied most extensively as mpf, a complex of cdc <dig> and cyclin b. recently, evidence has been obtained that cdc <dig> activity in porcine oocytes can alternatively be controlled by spdy, a protein with no homology to cyclin b  <cit> . here, we used a combination of staining approaches to identify the regulatory component of cdc <dig> during early phases of maturation. interestingly, we found that spdy was present in cdc2-positive eres in  <dig> h gv oocytes . since simultaneous labeling of oocytes for cyclin b and cdc <dig> was not possible due to the same host species of cyclin b and cdc <dig> antibodies, we used an alternative approach in which we identified eres by the presence of p-gm <dig>  oocytes  double-labeled for p-gm <dig> and cyclin b showed no cyclin b in p-gm130-labeled eres . instead, about half of the oocytes  showed clear cyclin b labeling in the gv . consistent with these observations, anti-pstair antibodies, which do not detect cdc <dig> when bound to cyclin b  <cit> , labeled p-gm130-containing eres , whereas pstair was not observed in the gv of any of the oocytes examined . these results indicate that cdc <dig> at eres associates with spdy, but not cyclin b, at the onset of oocyte maturation.

discussion
here, we show that the cell-cycle regulating protein cdc <dig> transiently associates with a cluster of eres at the onset of oocyte maturation, and propose that this association is involved in golgi retention. detailed microscopical analysis of large numbers of oocytes showed that during the initial phases of in vitro maturation, cdc <dig> localized to a large  structure, that was exclusively observed in the cortex, in about a quarter of gv oocytes . the eres marker sec <dig> colocalized with cdc <dig> in about half of these cortical domains , demonstrating that at least some of these cdc2-positive compartments consist of active eres. a morphologically identical domain labeled for the cdc <dig> target protein p-gm <dig> was observed in ~80% of  <dig> h gv stage oocytes , and almost all cdc2-labeled cortical domains also labeled for p-gm <dig>  in addition to this morphological likeness, only one p-gm130-labeled domain was observed per oocyte and this domain was always found in a cortical position. these identical features of sec <dig>  cdc <dig>  and/or p-gm130-labeled domains indicate that all of these domains were composed of eres, albeit mostly inactive eres, since the majority was devoid of sec <dig> labeling.

membrane trafficking, and thus association of sec <dig> with eres, is inhibited during mitosis in somatic cells  <cit> , which may in part be due to disassembly of eres  <cit> . upon disassembly, eres-resident proteins disperse into the er where they remain until the eres are reformed at the start of interphase  <cit> . our results support this view, since p-gm <dig> disperses from the eres-containing domain into the er prior to gvbd . however, p-gm <dig> localization at the cortical domain was observed in >80% of oocytes at mi and mii . no difference in either morphology or position within the oocyte could be observed throughout maturation using p-gm <dig> as a marker for this domain . therefore, it can be inferred that the p-gm130-labeled domain is composed of eres throughout maturation. when compared to eres described in most somatic cells and bovine oocytes  <cit> , the cortical domain in porcine oocytes is exceptionally large. since sec <dig> was not found outside the cortical domain , we conclude that most if not all eres are clustered together in the cortex at this stage. the presence of this single cluster of eres has not been reported before and appears to be a unique feature of oocytes.

during pre-gvbd ivm, the percentage of gv oocytes containing cdc2-labeled eres decreased significantly . when the onset of maturation was prevented by isolating cocs in the presence of the adenylate cyclase-stimulating drug forskolin, the occurrence of cdc2-labeled eres was significantly decreased , demonstrating that cdc <dig> translocation to and accumulation at eres is initiated upon release from meiotic inhibition. this cdc <dig> translocation may therefore constitute the first sign of meiosis resumption. cdc <dig> accumulation at eres was transient since the occurrence of cdc2-labeled eres increased within  <dig> h after release from forskolin-maintained meiotic arrest, and subsequently declined to a much lower level after  <dig> h of maturation . cdc2-labeled eres could not be detected in oocytes that had undergone gvbd, indicating that cdc <dig> accumulation, and hence cdc <dig> activity, at eres is specific for pre-gvbd stages. transient localization of cdc <dig> at eres would also explain the discrepancy between the occurrence of the cdc2-  and the p-gm130-labeled  eres cluster in immature oocytes. these results corroborate the proposition that stage dependent translocation of cdc <dig> underlies specific spatial and temporal control of cdc <dig> activity within oocytes  <cit> .

it is evident from studies on somatic cells that cdc <dig> is involved in fragmentation and partitioning of the golgi during early phases of mitosis  <cit> . golgi fragmentation is initiated by cdc2-dependent phosphorylation of the membrane-resident golgi protein gm <dig>  <cit> , followed by vesiculation of the collapsing cisternae  <cit> . in our experiments, the presence of forskolin during oocyte isolation did not change the occurrence of p-gm130-labeled eres at  <dig> h , indicating that p-gm <dig> accumulation at eres precedes meiosis resumption. the percentage of gv oocytes with a p-gm130-containing eres cluster declined from 80% in forskolin-inhibited  <dig> h matured oocytes to 35% at  <dig> h of maturation after forskolin removal . when oocytes were matured for longer intervals, i.e.  <dig> or  <dig> h, the percentage of oocytes showing a p-gm130-containing eres cluster equaled that of the  <dig> h controls , whereas cdc <dig> did not localize at eres clusters in mi  and mii  oocytes. these data indicate that the transient presence of cdc <dig> is closely followed by a transient absence of p-gm <dig> at eres, prior to gvbd. given the role of cdc <dig> in controlling eres disassembly at the onset of mitosis  <cit> , we propose that cdc <dig> controls dispersion of p-gm <dig> from eres into the reticular er.

two models on golgi partitioning during cell division are currently prevalent in literature. one model claims that golgi inheritance occurs independently from the er by association of golgi-derived vesicles with the developing spindle, which facilitates subsequent equal partitioning of these golgi fragments during telophase  <cit> . in the other model, known as the er-dependent model, golgi proteins redistribute into the er during metaphase and golgi stacks are reformed in daughter cells upon reinitiation of er export  <cit> . in our experimental model, most oocytes contained a p-gm130-labeled eres cluster immediately after isolation and at mi and mii , whereas p-gm <dig> was completely absent in the region surrounding the metaphase plates at both mi and mii . staining of the non-phosphorylated form of gm <dig> in the oocyte showed an increasingly dispersed pattern as maturation progressed , and p-gm <dig> staining in the er increased relative to staining in eres , suggesting that phosphorylation of gm <dig> and redistribution of p-gm <dig> into the er continues after meiosis resumption. phosphorylation of golgi-resident gm <dig> presumably triggers efficient translocation of this protein into the er, because the distributions of gm <dig> and p-gm <dig> were mutually exclusive in porcine oocytes . taken together, these results indicate that golgi inheritance in oocytes occurs through redistribution of golgi components into the er, and thus support an er-dependent model in oocytes.

our data indicate that cdc <dig> at eres was not complexed with cyclin b . instead, we observed spdy at cdc2-labeled eres , suggesting that spdy regulates cdc <dig> activity at eres. although we cannot conclude directly from our data that spdy associates with cdc <dig> at eres, additional evidence that spdy may be a key regulatory protein of cdc <dig> upstream of mpf in porcine oocytes is provided by the observation that  cdc2/cyclin b activity can only be detected in a histone h <dig> kinase assay after 18– <dig> h of maturation  <cit>  and that  injection of spdy mrna into oocytes accelerates oocyte maturation by stimulating mpf  <cit> .

our identification of a specialized cortical eres-containing domain prompted us to compare it to similar structures described for other species. morphologically, this cortical domain resembles organized smooth er , which consists of stacked membrane arrays  <cit> . in our study, the er-resident protein calnexin could not be detected in the cdc2-containing domain , indicating that this domain does not consist of reticular er. in xenopus laevis oocytes, cyclin b was found to localize to annulate lamellae, which may constitute one of the forms of oser in immature oocytes  <cit> . our studies show that neither the annulate lamellae marker nup <dig> , nor cyclin b , localize to the cortical domain in immature porcine oocytes, suggesting that this domain does not consist of oser or annulate lamellae. primordial oocytes of several species contain an aggregate of organelles, the balbiani body, which resembles the cdc2-labeled domain in size and in that there is only one of these bodies per oocyte. the balbiani body contains components of several organelles including mitochondria, golgi, and er, and dissipates after the primordial stage  <cit> . p-gm130-labeled cortical domains were devoid of markers for intact golgi  and mitochondrial markers , showing that the cortical domain and the balbiani body are unrelated structures.

based on observations in mitotic cells and our data from porcine oocytes, we hypothesize that prior to meiosis resumption, gm <dig> at the golgi is phosphorylated by cdc <dig>  <cit>  and subsequently transferred to eres. upon initiation of oocyte maturation, cdc <dig> activity at eres may result in dissociation of sec23-containing coats and consequent cessation of vesiculation  <cit> . other protein complexes that control eres function may also be phosphorylated  <cit> , allowing dispersion of p-gm <dig> into the reticular er, as observed for the eres transmembrane marker yip1a-gfp in cho cells  <cit> . this mechanism could prevent recycling of gm <dig> back to the fragmenting golgi and in this way facilitate complete golgi breakdown. as pre-gvbd maturation proceeds, cdc <dig> is transported away from eres , which may result in the renewed recruitment of p-gm <dig> to eres . since reformation of golgi complexes at eres has been observed in somatic cells  <cit> , storage of p-gm <dig> in a cluster of eres may allow for highly efficient and local reformation of the golgi apparatus once the metaphase block of er export is lifted after fertilization.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have observed a novel domain in the cortex of porcine oocytes that comprises a cluster of eres. we found that the well-known meiotic regulator cdc <dig> transiently localizes to this domain during pre-gvbd maturation, immediately after the oocyte is released from the inhibitory influence of the follicular environment. our data further suggest that cdc <dig>  in conjunction with its regulatory protein spdy, plays a role in regulating storage of structural golgi elements at this eres cluster. the early role of the cdc2/spdy complex described here adds to the available evidence  <cit>  that points to a role for cdc2/spdy upstream of mpf during oocyte maturation. finally, these findings demonstrate that pre-gvbd maturation comprises not only a set of changes in chromatin configuration  <cit> , but also controlled and highly local events within the cytoplasm of the oocyte, that may be important in regulating the secretory system during the meiotic divisions.
