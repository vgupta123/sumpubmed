BACKGROUND
“omic” technologies have advanced significantly in the years since the introduction of microarrays, and continuous improvements to sample processing speed, coupled with the decreasing cost of deep sequencing, have made these techniques accessible to a wider audience. microarrays are now often supplemented or replaced by rna-seq experiments, and tools like proteomics, ribosome profiling/ribo-seq and metabolomics are becoming commonplace. these individual techniques are data-intensive and holistic, which make them more useful than traditional molecular biology techniques when it comes to probing a complex system  <cit> . however, even with these advantages, single datasets still offer only one dimension of an organism’s activities. it is a well-studied phenomenon, for example, that mrna levels often correlate poorly with protein levels, especially in eukaryotes . even in bacteria, where many genes and operons are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level, newer research shows that co- and post-transcriptional regulatory networks have an important role in the expression of metabolic genes and protein abundance  <cit> . additionally, no matter the model system, transcription measurements alone provide little to no information about the catalytic activity of enzymes. for these reasons, researchers must collect and analyze multiple layers of -omics data simultaneously to truly understand a complex biological system. this data integration process, however, represents a major challenge for the systems biology field  <cit> .

to test the hypothesis that a multi-omics approach would provide a more fully realized model of a biological system, we collected and integrated rna-seq, microarray, ribo-seq, proteomic and small molecule data over the course of a single experiment. as our test system, we examined degradation of normal alkanes by two related strains of the bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa, as the basic steps in this process are understood, but a system-wide analysis had not yet been performed. here, we show for the first time, that integration of a unique combination of -omic data sets uncovers novel insights into a complex biological system.

RESULTS
two strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa show divergent gene expression profiles during growth on n-alkanes
multiple pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, including the clinical isolate pao <dig>  have been shown to grow on hydrocarbons as a sole carbon source . normal alkanes  are especially vulnerable to degradation by p. aeruginosa, but the process is complex, requiring both uptake of these hydrophobic compounds, as well as their subsequent oxidation  <cit> . n-alkane breakdown is known to require specific alkane hydroxylases, rubredoxins and rubredoxin reductases  <cit> , but little else is understood about the additional adaptations that make certain pseudomonads more efficient alkane degraders than others.


p. aeruginosa strain atcc  <dig> , isolated from a fuel storage tank, shows high sequence identity to pao <dig>  =  <dig> )  <cit> , but degrades components of jet a fuel more rapidly  <cit> . while jet a contains a diversity of hydrocarbon species, atcc  <dig> appears to favor specific components for degradation. amongst the most depleted species are the n-alkanes c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  <cit> . to determine why atcc  <dig> replicates more efficiently on these hydrocarbons, we compared gene expression in both strains during growth on a 5%  mixture of n-alkanes, composed of equal volumes of the c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> species. additional cultures were grown on 5% glycerol as a control. while atcc  <dig> and pao <dig> both grew well on glycerol, reaching od600 =  <dig>  after about 24 h, atcc  <dig> grew significantly faster on n-alkanes than did pao <dig>  . at the time of harvesting, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography  analysis showed that pao <dig> consumed significant amounts of only the c <dig> species while atcc  <dig> significantly depleted c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> .fig.  <dig> atcc  <dig> degrades n-alkanes more rapidly than pao <dig>   time required for atcc  <dig> and pao <dig> cultures to reach od600 =  <dig>  when provided with 5% v/v n-alkanes or glycerol as the sole carbon source. pao <dig>  and atcc  <dig>  n-alkane degradation profiles at the time of harvesting. all conditions were tested in triplicate. * indicates p <  <dig>  for data discussed in text




at od600 =  <dig> , triplicate samples from each culture condition were harvested and processed for total rna, ribosome footprints, intracellular protein and extracellular small molecules . before any further analysis, both genomes were re-annotated using the rast  server  <cit> , the pseudomonas database   <cit>  and the protein sequence annotation tool  <cit>  . the pae_g1a affymetrix microarray, designed against the pao <dig> genome sequence  <cit> , was used to supplement rna-seq data when atcc  <dig> showed high sequence identity to the cdna probes . gene expression profiles, as well as translation efficiency values, were generated and compared across each carbon source; pao1+alkanes vs. atcc 33988+alkanes , pao1+glycerol vs. atcc 33988+glycerol , and across each strain; pao1+alkanes vs. pao1+glycerol , atcc 33988+alkanes vs. atcc 33988+glycerol . within each comparison, genes whose expression changed by >2-fold, and whose p-values were < <dig> , were considered “hits” .fig.  <dig> experimental schematic. minimal media was inoculated with two different strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at od600 =  <dig> . glycerol or a mixture of n-alkanes were provided as the sole carbon source. cultures were shaken, and at od600 =  <dig> , harvested for total rna , ribosome footprints, intracellular protein and extracellular small molecules




both pao <dig> and atcc  <dig> induced characteristic expression profiles when exposed to n-alkanes  and glycerol . there was substantial overlap in genes induced at the total rna and ribosome footprint levels, suggesting that when a gene was transcriptionally induced, it was often translationally induced as well. this relationship is mirrored in the sorting of genes into either ‘high’ or ‘low’ transcription/translation groups based on an unsupervised statistical clustering analysis . most genes are sorted into the same group for transcription and translation ; it was far more rare for a gene to be classified as highly transcribed and lowly translated or vice versa.fig.  <dig> atcc  <dig> and pao <dig> induce divergent gene expression profiles when grown on n-alkanes.  venn diagrams represent the number of pseudomonas aeruginosa genes that are >2-fold increased in one strain when compared to the other during growth in n-alkanes . blue circle = rna-seq, pink circle = ribosome footprinting, green circle = proteomics.  percentages of total analyzed genes that fall within each of four genomic expression categories. genes are assigned to one of four categories based on whether they appear in the ‘high’ value or ‘low’ value component of the rna-seq  or ribosome footprint  results. see methods for further explanation of categorization strategy




aerobic catabolism of n-alkanes by p. aeruginosa is thought to begin with either a terminal or sub-terminal oxidation step  <cit> . these reactions require the alkane hydroxylases alkb <dig>  and alkb <dig> , the rubredoxins ruba <dig>  and ruba <dig>  and the rubredoxin reductase rubb   <cit> . pao <dig> and atcc  <dig> encode identical versions of alkb1/ <dig> and ruba1/ <dig>  and highly similar versions of rubb . while the rubab operon was expressed relatively equally under all conditions, as has been observed previously  <cit> , both alkane hydroxylases were highly induced at multiple levels during growth in alkanes . similarly, when grown in glycerol, both strains saw induction genes of the glp operon, which is required for glycerol import and catabolism  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> genes known to be involved in n-alkane and glycerol metabolism are induced during growth in their respective carbon sources. heat maps representing the fold-change in total rna , ribosome footprints  and protein  of genes known to be involved in  n-alkane degradation and  glycerol degradation. all expression values are log2-transformed. if a protein is not detected in any sample, the corresponding box is labeled grey. if a gene is not present in atcc  <dig>  the log <dig> is the value 1




localization and functional analysis underlined the diverse nature of genes induced by each strain in each carbon source . however, the most highly represented subset of genes induced by atcc 33988+alkanes vs pao1+alkanes was those annotated as hypothetical or with no known function, despite using multiple annotation tools . similar results were previously seen when total rna from atcc  <dig> grown in jet a fuel was compared to rna from atcc  <dig> grown in glycerol  <cit> , emphasizing the need for continued annotation efforts for both p. aeruginosa genomes.fig.  <dig> functional annotation and localization of genes induced by p. aeruginosa strains grown in n-alkanes. functional annotations  and cellular localization  of genes up-regulated in atcc  <dig> vs pao <dig> during growth in n-alkanes.  same as above for those genes up-regulated by pao <dig> vs atcc  <dig> during growth in n-alkanes




to determine how atcc  <dig> replicated so efficiently on n-alkanes, we initially focused our analysis on genes differentially expressed by atcc  <dig> versus pao <dig> during growth on the hydrocarbon mixture . however, as gene expression was measured at a single time point, fold-change values could not distinguish between induction of a gene in 3a vs. pa and repression in pa vs. pg. to differentiate between these two scenarios, we examined fold-changes for each gene in a single strain in both carbon sources . using this technique, we could predict whether a gene was induced by atcc  <dig> in n-alkanes, or if it was instead repressed by pao <dig> in n-alkanes. the latter was the case for the oprb operon, which is involved in carbohydrate transport   <cit>  . additionally, by examining the fold-change of a gene between strains in glycerol , we could determine if a gene was induced by one strain compared to the other regardless of the carbon source. this was the case with the toxin-producing amb operon , which is expressed more highly in pao <dig> in all conditions tested  <cit>  . when analyzed simultaneously, these pair-wise comparisons identified alkane-induced genes in both strains as well as genes differentially expressed regardless of carbon source.

rhamnolipid species do not account for the faster n-alkane degradation by atcc 33988
due to their low solubility in aqueous conditions, a major limiting step in hydrocarbon degradation by pseudomonads is bringing the carbon source in contact with the bacteria. two major strategies have been described to solve this problem; “presolubilization” of hydrocarbons by emulsification, and increasing direct cellular adhesion to the hydrocarbon  <cit> . pseudomonas aeruginosa strains have the capacity to produce and secrete dozens of extracellular molecules, including the amphipathic bioemulsifiers known as rhamnolipids  <cit> . these compounds can increase the solubility of alkanes in culture media, thus improving their bioavailability  <cit> . to determine whether atcc  <dig> increased rhamnolipid production to improve growth on n-alkanes, we examined gene expression from the rhl rhamnolipid biosynthetic operon , and measured small molecule production by accurate mass liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry . in p. aeruginosa, rhamnolipid production begins with the expression of rhli , which synthesizes the quorum sensing autoinducer n-butyryl-dl-homoserine lactone   <cit> . when levels of c4-hsl reach a threshold concentration, it interacts with the transcriptional regulator rhlr  to activate transcription of the rhamnolipid biosynthetic genes rhla , rhlb  and rhlc . surprisingly, every component of this core pathway was induced by pao <dig>  when compared to atcc  <dig> , regardless of carbon source . this trend held true at the total rna, microarray, ribosome footprint and protein  levels. consistent with our gene expression findings, we detected c4-hsl in the spent liquid medium  of pao <dig> cultures, but not with atcc  <dig> . this was also true for rhamnolipid production; pao <dig> produced several rhamnolipid species in the slm: the di-rhamno-di-lipidic congeners rha-rha-, rha-rha- and rha-rha-, as well as the mono-rhamno-di-lipidic congener rha-. extracted ion chromatograms  of the most abundant rhamnolipid rha-rha- are shown in fig. 6d. no rhamnolipid production was detected for atcc  <dig> fig.  <dig> atcc  <dig> does not use rhamnolipids to improve n-alkane degradation.  rhamnolipid synthesis pathway: rhli produces the autoinducer n-butyryl-dl-homoserine lactone  when levels of c4-hsl reach a threshold limit, they activate the transcription factor rhlr. rhlr increases transcription of the rhamnolipid biosynthetic enzymes rhla, rhlb and rhlc, which produce rhamnolipids.  heat map representing the fold-change in total rna , ribosome footprints  and protein  of genes in the rhamnolipid synthesis pathway. all expression values are log2-transformed. undetected genes are shaded grey. if a gene is not present in atcc  <dig>  the log <dig> is given the value  <dig>  lc-ms traces of the autoinducer molecule c4-hsl  and a sample di-rhamnolipid  in the extracellular media. e surface tension of each culture. * indicates p <  <dig>  for data discussed in the text




in addition to increasing alkane solubility, rhamnolipids also decrease surface tension at the media/air boundary  <cit> . we observed that surface tension decreased significantly in pao1+glycerol and pao1+alkane samples compared to media alone, while a more modest decrease was seen in atcc  <dig> only after growth in alkanes .

as mentioned above, cells can also increase contact with hydrocarbons by improving the direct adhesion of these compounds to the cell surface. this often involves an increase in cell surface hydrophobicity, which can be measured by the bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons  assay  <cit> . we found that pao <dig> is more hydrophobic than atcc  <dig>  regardless of growth in glycerol or n-alkanes .

atcc  <dig> does not encode the lasi/lasr components of the quorum sensing response
rhamnolipids are produced as part of the quorum sensing  response in p. aeruginosa, a complex, interregulated system that controls the transcription of certain genes based on cell density  <cit> . many genes in the qs regulon, in addition to the rhl operon, have been predicted to play a role in alkane degradation, including those involved in the formation of biofilms, iron acquisition or efflux pumps  <cit> . along with rhl, there are two other well-characterized branches of the qs system, las and pqs, each with their own autoinducer molecules. just as with c4-hsl, at a critical concentration, the las and pqs autoinducers bind to cognate transcription factors, which induce or repress a downstream regulon . in the las system, lasi  produces the signaling molecule n-3-oxododecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone , which binds to lasr. in the pqs system, quinolones are used as autoinducers. specifically, pqsabcde  and pqsh  synthesize 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone , which binds to pqsr .fig.  <dig> atcc  <dig> shows muted expression from the qs network.  schematic showing qs autoinducer synthesis genes and cognate receptors for in pseudomonas aeruginosa as discussed in text. lc-ms traces of the autoinducer molecules  3-oxo-c12-hsl and  pqs in the extracellular media. triangles represent putative pqs isomers with different retention times but the same exact mass as the pqs standard




similarly to the rhl operon, total rna, ribosome footprint and protein levels of the las and pqs regulator genes were induced in pao1+alkanes versus atcc 33988+alkanes . in support of this result, the two corresponding autoinducers, 3-oxo-c12-hsl and pqs, were present at higher levels in pao <dig> cultures as determined by lc-ms analysis, and in particular in pao1+alkane cultures . the lack of 3-oxo-c12-hsl in atcc  <dig> cultures was especially telling, as it is the las system that is primarily responsible for the initial induction of both the rhl and pqs systems under standard laboratory conditions  <cit> . due to the decreased levels of qs autoinducers in atcc  <dig> slm, we hypothesized that this strain may lack the lasr and lasi genes, resulting in a muted qs response. indeed, pcr amplification of the sequence-conserved regions surrounding lasr and lasi showed that atcc  <dig> does not encode either of these genes . these results suggest that atcc  <dig> does not use the qs response in the same fashion as pao <dig>  and that canonical qs induction is not responsible for atcc 33988’s increased n-alkane degradation rates.fig.  <dig> atcc  <dig> does not encode lasi/lasr.  genome organization of the lasr-lasi fragment of pao <dig>  to evaluate the presence or absense of the lasi/lasr genes in atcc  <dig>  three sets of pcr primers were designed. the red and blue primer pairs amplify regions within the lasr and lasi genes, respectively. expected pcr product sizes were 295 bp  and 204 bp . the third primer pair  anneals to the region flanking the lasr/lasi region, which is sequence-conserved in both strains. when both lasr and lasi were present in this region, the expected pcr product size was  <dig>  kbp. all pcr products were run on a  <dig> % agarose gel.  heat map representing the fold-change in gene expression between pao <dig> in alkanes and atcc  <dig> in alkanes. all expression values are log2-transformed. if a gene is not detected in any sample, the corresponding box is shaded grey. if a gene is not present in atcc  <dig>  the log <dig> value is assigned to  <dig>  r = total rna, f = ribosome footprints, p = proteomics




in different strain backgrounds and environmental conditions, the response to lasi and 3-oxo-c12-hsl production varies. however, there is a set of “core quorum-controlled genes” thought to be induced by p. aeruginosa acyl-serine lactones  regardless of ecological niche  <cit> . total rna, footprint and protein levels of nearly all of these genes were induced in pao1+alkanes versus atcc 33988+alkanes . the exception to this phenotype was the set of genes pa1245- <dig>  which were all induced in atcc 33988+alkanes.

multi-omics identifies operons induced by atcc  <dig> during growth on n-alkanes
five genes of the apr operon  were the sole representatives from the set of core qs-regulated genes that were induced by atcc 33988+alkanes versus pao1+alkanes . this operon encodes the machinery for the production and secretion of the proteases apra and aprx  <cit> . in addition to being induced by the qs apparatus, apra is positively regulated by the bi-stable transcription regulator bexr . interestingly, ectopic expression of bexr has previously been shown to increase mexghi-opmd  expression and decrease mexef-oprn  expression  <cit> . both of these phenotypes were also observed when comparing growth of atcc  <dig> and pao <dig> in alkanes .fig.  <dig> gene expression from the apr, mexghi-opmd and sphr operons were induced by atcc  <dig> growth in n-alkanes. each panel portrays the operon organization, ribosome footprint traces and gene expression profiles  for the indicated set of genes  apr operon,  mexghi-opmd operon,  mexef-oprn operon, and  sphr regulon. for ribosome footprinting traces, each row represents one biological replicate




by expanding our examination to include non qs-sensitive genes, we identified an additional sets of genes more heavily induced by atcc  <dig> than pao <dig> in n-alkanes. the sphr regulon includes the five consecutive genes pa5324- <dig>  as well as the upstream neutral ceramidase . each of these genes was highly induced by atcc  <dig> in n-alkanes . in addition to being induced intracellularly by atcc  <dig>  the cern protein was also present at high levels in the extracellular media of the environmental isolate . these genes are all transcriptionally induced by sphingosine  <cit> , but their roles in alkane degradation pathways are not known. no sphingosine was present in the extracellular media of any cultures.

discussion
in the present study, results from transcriptome, translatome, proteome and small molecule analyses were integrated to better understand gene expression changes that occur during growth in n-alkanes by related strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. these large data sets both confirm and extend previous findings from microarray analyses of these bacteria during growth on petroleum hydrocarbons  <cit> . p. aeruginosa strain atcc  <dig>  isolated from a fuel storage tank, has been shown to grow significantly faster on jet fuel than the laboratory strain pao <dig>  <cit> , and we found that this increased growth rate is also observed during growth in c8–c16
n-alkanes . since these strains show a high level of genome sequence identity, the adaptations that make atcc  <dig> more efficient in n-alkane degradation are likely due to differences in the regulation of gene expression. by combining information about the transcription, translation, protein and small molecule profiles of atcc  <dig> and pao <dig>  we were able to determine where gene expression deviated between the strains. this information led to several testable hypotheses, and has provided possible explanations for why atcc  <dig> performs better when grown on n-alkanes.

transcription and translation of most p. aeruginosa genes are induced or repressed in tandem
one weakness of studies that report only rna measurements is the poor correlation sometimes seen between mrna and protein  <cit> . this weak relationship between transcript and protein levels is likely due to the multiple regulatory steps that occur co- and post-transcriptionally, which makes it difficult to draw accurate conclusions about the cellular environment based solely on microarray or rna-seq data. for atcc  <dig> and pao <dig>  however, we found that for many genes, an increase in total rna values under one condition frequently occurred alongside an increase in ribosome footprint levels . for a large percentage of genes , the mrna abundance level, when categorized into “high” or “low” bins, matched translation level categorizations . this trend was also present, but less robust, when comparing total rna and footprint levels to protein levels. these results suggest that regulation of gene expression for these two strains of p. aeruginosa often begins during transcription, and that when gene transcription is induced, translation is also induced by at least the same, if not greater, magnitude. a prime example of this pattern is seen with alkb <dig> and alkb <dig>  the two alkane hydroxylases that catalyze the initial oxidation step in alkane degradation  <cit> . when comparing expression levels of these genes in atcc 33988+alkanes versus glycerol, transcription was induced by 12-fold  and 41-fold , footprints were induced by 43- and 217-fold, and both proteins were highly expressed in alkane cultures while absent in glycerol cultures . this trend was maintained in measurements of translation efficiency , specifically for alkb <dig> during growth in alkanes . expression of these genes in pao <dig> showed a similar pattern.

strain atcc  <dig> shows a reduced quorum-sensing response
atcc  <dig> grew much faster than pao <dig> on n-alkanes, and we expected gene expression profiles to reflect this disparity. many of the most significant differences between the two strains during growth on n-alkanes appeared in genes involved in the cell density-dependent quorum sensing  response. qs plays a complex, important role in the p. aeruginosa life cycle, and hundreds of genes have been shown to be responsive to qs signaling molecules under varying conditions  <cit> . the functions of these genes are diverse, contributing to everything from biofilm formation to virulence. qs is highly regulated, and at least three autoinducer molecules activate cognate transcription factors that act on various sub-populations of the regulon. our total rna and ribosome footprint data showed that atcc  <dig> had little to no transcription or translation of any of the major autoinducer biosynthesis genes  or their complementary receptors  when compared to pao <dig> . this observation suggested that atcc  <dig> was unlikely to synthesize any of the qs autoinducers , which was supported by small molecule analysis .

given that only very low levels of autoinducer molecules were present in atcc  <dig> cultures, it was unsurprising that atcc  <dig> did not express many of the “core” qs-responsive genes to the same extent as pao <dig> . the current view is that while each of the three major branches of the qs network can affect the others, the las branch sits at the top of the hierarchy  <cit> . atcc  <dig> showed no expression of lasi or lasr at the transcription, translation or protein levels, contributing to the low expression from the rhl and pqs operons. as before, results from the initial -omics experiments led to a prediction about atcc  <dig>  this time that it may lack the lasi and lasr genes. subsequent pcr amplification proved that atcc  <dig> did not encode lasi or lasr in its genome .

a major downstream effect of qs induction by pao <dig> versus atcc  <dig> was the increased transcription and translation of the rhamnolipid synthetic genes rhla, rhlb and rhlc in pao <dig>  rhamnolipids can be used to disperse hydrophobic compounds in aqueous environments, and when access to n-alkanes is a rate-limiting step in their consumption, increased rhamnolipid secretion could improve pseudomonas growth on n-alkanes. previous work, for example, has shown that exogenous rhamnolipids improve octadecane degradation by p. aeruginosa strain atcc  <dig>  <cit> , and other studies have reported similar growth advantages with different hydrocarbon mixtures . however, despite the fact that atcc  <dig> grew faster in n-alkanes, it had minimal expression from the rhl operon, which suggested that it didn’t produce this class of molecule. lc-ms analysis supported this hypothesis. these results show that rhamnolipids are not necessary for all p. aeruginosa species during growth on specific hydrocarbons, and they do not contribute to the faster growth of atcc  <dig> on our n-alkane mixture.

even without producing rhamnolipids, atcc  <dig> did show a small decrease in surface tension during growth on n-alkanes, suggesting the strain produces an alternative biosurfactant/bioemulsifier. microbial surfactants can have a variety of structures, including glycolipids , phospholipids, fatty acids and proteins. both p. aeruginosa strains used in this study encode the “protein activator” pra , which has been shown to possess emulsification activity and improve p. aeruginosa growth on hexadecane in the presence and absence of rhamnolipids  <cit> . our data showed that transcription and translation of pra were induced by atcc  <dig>  during growth in alkanes . it is possible, then, that the smaller decrease in surface tension induced by atcc  <dig> during growth on n-alkanes may be due to pra. future experiments measuring surface tension and n-alkane degradation by atcc  <dig> in the absence of pra would provide direct clues as to its role in these processes.

divergent models for n-alkane uptake in strains of p. aeruginosa

n-alkane degradation requires two separate steps: uptake and catabolism. our results suggest that pao <dig> utilizes two strategies to improve alkane uptake: pre-solubilizing hydrophobic compounds and increasing cell surface hydrophobicity. pre-solubilization  are likely achieved through the emulsification activity of rhamnolipids and the protein pra  <cit> , both of which were induced during growth on n-alkanes. increased surface hydrophobicity was also likely due to rhamnolipid production, as they have been shown previously to have this effect on pseudomonads grown in certain conditions  <cit> .

atcc  <dig> did not produce significant levels of rhamnolipids, which likely explains its higher surface tension and lower surface hydrophobicity measurements. how, then, does atcc  <dig> uptake n-alkanes? as mentioned above, atcc  <dig> induced the expression of pra during growth in n-alkanes. rhamnolipids and pra, while both emulsifiers, have very different structures, and potentially different environmental niches in which they are most useful. as atcc  <dig> was isolated from a fuel storage tank, and grows more quickly on n-alkanes, it is possible that it has evolved to decrease rhamnolipid production because they are inhibitory or unhelpful to its growth on hydrocarbons. in fact, previous studies have found that addition of biosurfactant to environmental isolates of bacteria are equally as likely to have a positive, negative, or neutral effect on the degradation of hydrophobic compounds  <cit> . our data suggests that the role of rhamnolipids in uptake of hydrophobic substrates may be more complex than originally thought, and emphasizes the importance of compatibility between surfactant and microbe.

-omics data identifies candidate genes potentially responsible for the improved growth and/or survival of atcc  <dig> on n-alkanes
while expression from the rhl and las operons were primarily limited to pao <dig>  atcc  <dig> did induce some genes during growth on n-alkanes when compared to pao <dig>  this expression pattern makes these genes attractive candidates for further exploration regarding their roles in atcc 33988’s more efficient growth/survival on our n-alkane mixture. one robust example was the apr operon . the genes aprx and apra showed especially large changes in expression as compared to pao <dig> in alkanes. both of these proteins are secreted proteases, and while the substrate of aprx is not known, apra can cleave several components of the host immune system  <cit> . as they are found outside of the cell, one or both of these proteases may have access to proteins of the bacteria-produced extracellular polymeric substance . while far from conclusive, there is evidence of eps inhibiting adherence of bacteria to hydrocarbons  <cit> , and apra/x could potentially act to degrade the proteinaceous component. further determination of aprx substrate specificity will help answer this question.

atcc  <dig> grown in n-alkanes also induced expression of the sphr regulon to a higher degree than pao <dig> . little is known about the sphr regulon, other than the fact that sphr binds, and is responsive to, exogenous sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine  <cit> . interestingly, sphingosine is a component of human lung surfactants, and while atcc  <dig> does not produce rhamnolipids, it is possible that it synthesizes a yet unidentified surfactant species in the presence of n-alkanes, and that this compound may be structurally similar to sphingosine, and more compatible with atcc  <dig> than rhamnolipids.

once internalized, alkanes are catabolized through the action of alkane monooxygenases alkb1/b <dig>  rubredoxins ruba1/a <dig> and rubredoxin reductase rubb. both atcc  <dig> and pao <dig> encode these enzymes, and the monooxygenases, in particular, are highly induced by n-alkanes. both the sub-terminal and terminal oxidation strategies for alkane degradation involve the downstream enzymatic activity of an alcohol dehydrogenase  to eventually convert the alkanes into fatty acids that can be degraded by β-oxidation. pao <dig> and atcc  <dig> encode more than a dozen known and putative adh enzymes, but of particular interest is pa <dig>  which is induced by atcc 33988+alkanes at both the transcriptional and translational levels when compared to pao1+alkanes. more work needs to be done on the substrate specificity of pa <dig>  but it is possible that atcc  <dig> uses this enzyme to more efficiently catabolize alcohols formed during the degradation of n-alkanes.

it also must be mentioned that this analysis identified several hundred genes found only in one strain or the other. more than half of these genes were not functionally characterized by any annotation tool used in this study, and none were annotated as alkane hydroxylases, rubredoxins or rubredoxin reductases. as such, their role in the metabolism of n-alkanes remains to be addressed.

the role of multi-omics experiments in the field of systems biology
in this study, we show the power of integrating multiple –omics data sets towards a better understanding a complex biological process: n-alkane degradation in pseudomonas aeruginosa. by collecting expression data from rna-seq, microarray, ribosome footprinting, proteomic and small molecule mass spectrometry experiments, we were able to not only confirm previously observed phenotypes , but were able to generate and test new hypotheses regarding hydrocarbon consumption by bacteria. this type of integrative system biology is especially useful when dealing with draft, or incompletely annotated, genomes, as rna-seq can provide information about 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions and transcription start sites, while ribosome footprinting can elucidate frameshifts, alternative start sites and nested genes. our data allowed us to update gene annotations based on expression under certain conditions, and also identified dozens of genes that were unique to one strain or another, which could play a role in adapting to a hydrocarbon environment. while typically less sensitive than sequencing-based tools, proteomics can give information about localization and post-translational modifications, and to complete the process, the reagents and products of enzymatic reactions can be quantified by targeting specific small molecules for quantification .table  <dig> strengths and weaknesses of -omic techniques

moving forward, tools that integrate -omics data sets must continue to improve and become more user-friendly. as protocols advance and allow for higher throughput and higher resolution data gathering, the future of the field lies in the ability to both vertically and horizontally integrate this new information.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the advancements that have been made in high-throughput technologies, integration of these data sets, and elucidation of biological meaning remains a challenge. in this study, a unique set of -omics tools were combined to generate a holistic picture of normal alkane degradation by two strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. each strain utilizes a different set of genes for growth on alkanes, and the environmental isolate atcc  <dig> does so without the full quorum sensing response, and with little-to-no production of rhamnolipids. several operons are uniquely induced by atcc  <dig>  and these genes represent the most appealing choices for further mechanistic examination. this genome-wide, systems-based strategy not only uncovers important layers of regulation used by each strain during growth on alkanes, but additionally generates specific, testable hypotheses.
