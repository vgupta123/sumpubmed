BACKGROUND
de novo prediction of protein three-dimensional structure from the primary sequence remains a fundamental and extraordinarily challenging problem. many one-dimensional and two-dimensional structural features, i.e. structural properties of individual residues or of couples of residues in a protein, have long been identified as useful intermediate representations between the primary sequence and the full three-dimensional structure, which can be adopted as a stage towards the prediction of protein structure and function. for instance accurate secondary structure and solvent accessibility information have been shown to improve the sensitivity of fold recognition methods  and are at the core of most ab initio methods  for the prediction of protein structure.

we have developed a number of predictors of structural features of proteins. some of the features predicted are novel and highly informative , others are well established  but predicted at state-of-the-art accuracy levels  <cit> .

all methods are freely available through simple web interfaces, which allow the processing of medium- to large-scale jobs by any selection of the servers with only a small number of manual submissions.

implementation
algorithms
all one- and two-dimensional structural feature predictors are based on single- or dual-layer recursive neural network architectures for directed acyclic graphs   <cit> . one-dimensional feature predictors  are based on 1d dag rnns  <cit> , while two-dimensional feature predictors  are based on 2d dag rnns  <cit> , or combinations of the two  <cit> . all rnns have shortcut connections to cut the length of paths between different inputs. this facilitates the transmission of long-range information, which is relevant to determine non-local structural properties such as the formation of β-sheets. in dual-layer rnns, the second layer, or filter, incorporates long-range information directly . in this way, information from up to  <dig> residues is taken into account when a final prediction is made. for a more detailed description of the models and training algorithms, see  <cit> . all systems adopt large-scale ensembles of predictors , trained on large, non-redundant datasets extracted from the pdb  <cit> .

the predictor of cα traces relies on a simple optimisation procedure, similar to that in  <cit> , guided by a potential or pseudo-energy based on one- and two-dimensional feature predictions. the target of the optimisation is realising the cα trace which enforces the predicted features  "best", while preserving some trivial properties such as realistic distances between neighbouring cαs and absence of clashes. the optimisation algorithm and potential are described in detail in  <cit> .

data sets
all predictors of one-dimensional and two-dimensional features are trained on datasets extracted from the december  <dig> 25% pdb_select set  <cit> . we use the dssp program  <cit>  to assign target structural features and remove sequences for which dssp does not produce an output due, for instance, to missing entries or format errors. after processing by dssp, the set contains  <dig> protein and  <dig>  amino acids .

multiple sequence alignments for s <dig> are extracted from the nr database as available on march  <dig>  <dig> containing over  <dig>  million sequences. the database is first redundancy reduced at a 98% threshold, leading to a final  <dig>  million sequences. the alignments are generated by three runs of psi-blast  <cit> . multiple alignment generation in online server operation is handled transparently and does not require user intervention.

the predictor of cα traces is benchmarked on a subset of the pdb available on april  <dig>  <dig> generated as follows: all proteins showing more than 22% sequence similarity to s <dig> or shorter than  <dig> residues were excluded; the remaining set was redundancy reduced at a maximum 22% sequence similarity threshold; proteins longer than  <dig> residues were excluded. the final set contains  <dig> proteins .

servers
the distill suite of servers currently contains  <dig> predictors:  <dig> of one-dimensional features ;  <dig> of two-dimensional features ; the predictor of cα traces . the chart in figure  <dig> represent the flow of information between the servers. details about each server are provided below.

secondary structure
porter  <cit>  is a system for protein secondary structure prediction based on an ensemble of 1d dag-rnns. porter is an evolution of the sspro  <cit>  server. porter's improvements include: rich input coding ; output filtering and incorporation of predicted long-range information ; large training sets ; large-scale ensembling . moreover, when this is available, homology information to structures in the pdb is provided as a further input to the system  <cit>  .

structural motifs
porter+  <cit>  classifies each residue into one out of  <dig> local structural motifs. the motifs are built by applying multidimensional scaling and clustering to pair-wise angular distances between quadruplets of Φ – Ψ dihedral angle pairs collected from high-resolution protein structures  <cit> . structural motif predictions are highly informative and provide a finer-resolution picture of a protein backbone than  traditional 3-class secondary structure. the definition and one-letter code for the  <dig> structural motifs are provided in the help web page.

relative solvent accessibility
paleale, a novel component of distill, classifies each residue as being in one of  <dig>  classes of solvent accessibility: b = completely buried ; b = partly buried ; e = partly exposed ; e = completely exposed . the architecture of paleale's classifier is an exact copy of porter's . as in the case of porter, when available, homology information to structures in the pdb is provided as a further input, yielding more accurate predictions  <cit>  .

contact density
brownale  <cit>  is a system for the prediction of protein contact density. we define contact density as the principal eigenvector  of a protein's residue contact map at 8Å, multiplied by the principal eigenvalue. let λ = {λ : cx = λx} be the spectrum of c , s

brownale predicts contact density in  <dig> classes. the class thresholds are assigned so that the classes are approximately equally numerous, as follows: n = very low contact density ; n = medium-low contact density ; c = medium-high contact density ; c = very high contact density . brownale's architecture is an exact copy of porter's . secondary structure  is fed as input into brownale, beside the primary sequence. predicted contact density contributes significantly to improved residue contact map predictions  <cit> , especially for long-ranged contacts.

coarse contact maps and topologies
xstout  <cit>  is a system for the prediction of protein coarse topologies. a protein is represented by a set of rigid rods associated with its secondary structure elements . 4-class distance maps and 3-class angle maps between secondary structure elements are first predicted based on the primary sequence and on predicted secondary structure and solvent accessibility , and coarse 3d folds of proteins are then assembled starting from these maps. 3d reconstruction is carried out by minimising a cost function taking the form of a purely geometrical potential. coarse folds are only predicted when cα trace predictions are not available , or not requested by the user.

residue contact maps
xxstout  <cit>  is a system for the prediction of protein residue contact maps. the contact map of a protein with n amino acids is a symmetric n × n matrix c, with elements cij defined as:

cij={1if amino acid i and j are in contact0otherwise

we define two amino acids as being in contact if the distance between their cα is less than a given threshold.

xxstout predicts contacts at three different thresholds:  <dig> Å,  <dig> Å and  <dig> Å. contact maps are predicted as follows: protein secondary structure, solvent accessibility and contact density are predicted from the sequence using, respectively, porter, paleale and brownale; ensembles of two-dimensional recursive neural networks  <cit>  predict the contact maps based on the sequence, a 2-dimensional profile of amino-acid frequencies obtained from psi-blast alignments of the sequence against the nr, and predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility and contact density. xxstout is trained and tested in cross-validation on a sample of the s <dig> dataset containing only sequences of length at most  <dig> residues .

cα traces
3distill is a server for the prediction of protein cα traces. 3distill relies on a fast optimisation algorithm guided by a potential built on the  <dig> classes of structural features predicted by the other systems. a preliminary implementation of 3distill   <cit> , was ranked with model  <dig>  9-th out of  <dig> predictors for gdt_ts on novel fold hard targets, and 20-th for z-score for all novel fold and near novel fold targets  at the casp <dig> competition  <cit> . the online version currently available is a substantial improvement of the casp <dig> one, based on more accurate structural feature predictions, and on a refined search algorithm. homology information to structures in the pdb is also now exploited, when available. this is achieved by two means: secondary structure, solvent accessibility and contact maps are predicted by specialised systems which incorporate homology information as a further input  <cit> ; structural similarity to homologues is directly used in the optimisation. not surprisingly, the availability of homology information results in greatly increased accuracy of the models .

input format
input into the servers is handled by two simple html forms: one for submissions of single queries ; the other for submitting multiple queries. in both forms the user must provide an email address, to which the response will be sent. in the single-query form the user has also the option of providing a query name, that will be reported in the server response. in the single-query form the user needs to provide the query sequence in plain 1-letter code, with no headers. new-line, tab and space characters are ignored. in the multi-query form the user may provide the queries in fasta format, with each query name preceded by the > symbol on a line and the corresponding protein sequence on the following line or lines . if the user adopts the multi-query form, a separate email will be sent for each query. the query name quoted in the response will be the query name as parsed from the fasta format. in both forms the user can select any combination of the servers via a set of tick-boxes. submissions of up to  <dig>  characters  are accepted by the multi-query form, making medium- to large-scale predictions possible with only a small number of manual submissions.

output format
server responses are sent by email. one-dimensional feature predictions  are sent in plain text attached to the email. a detailed description of the codes, of their precise definitions, and an example of server response, are provided in the help web page  <cit> . the following is an example of server's response to a query sequence of length 106:

          porter and paleale predictions based on pdb templates

          

all one-dimensional features come predicted in 1-letter codes. the predictions are split into groups of lines of length  <dig>  the first line in each group is the 1-letter code for the primary sequence . the second line is the secondary structure predicted by porter . the symbols have the following meaning:

• h = helix: dssp's h  or g  or i  classes.

• e = strand : dssp's e  or b  classes.

• c = the rest : dssp's t  or s  or . .

the third line represents predictions by porter+. the line is present if the user asked for porter+ predictions. each residue is mapped into one of  <dig> possible structural motifs coded as 1-letter symbols – the 1-letter code for the motifs is devised to be mnemonically related to secondary structure . the online help page provides a complete description of the codes representing porter+ outputs.

the fourth line represents relative solvent accessibility predicted by paleale: b = completely buried , b = partly buried , e = partly exposed , e = completely exposed . the line is present if the user requested a paleale prediction.

the fifth line reports contact density predictions by brownale. each letter in the sequence represents a contact density class: n = very low contact density , n = medium-low contact density [ <dig> , <dig> ), c = medium-high contact density [ <dig> , <dig> ), c = very high contact density [ <dig> , + ∞). this line is present if the user requested brownale predictions.

two dimensional feature predictions  come as files attached to the email. xstout's outputs come as  <dig> attachments:

• attachment  <dig>  : the distance map. the segments  are listed first, followed by one line for each pair of segments, indicating predicted distance range between the two contacts, followed by a reliability index. distance ranges predicted are [0Å,10Å), [10Å,18Å), [18Å,29Å) and [29Å, + ∞). an example of xstout output is provided in the online help of the servers.

• attachments 2– <dig> :  <dig> coarse reconstructions, in pdb format. points represented are the termini of all helices and strands of length  <dig> or greater – there will be 2n such points in a protein with n segments.

residue contact maps defined at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> Å  are formatted as an n × n matrix of real numbers, where the j-th number on row i represents the estimated probability of contact between residues in positions i and j. png images containing grey-scale representations of residue contact maps are also automatically generated, if the user ticks the appropriate box. figure  <dig> shows the png image of the contact map  for the previous example. probabilities of contacts are represented as levels of grey ranging from pure black  to pure white .

if 3distill is selected,  <dig> models for the cα trace are provided, if the query is at most  <dig> residues long. in case it is longer, fold predictions by xstout are automatically sent instead. the models come attached to the email in pdb format, and readable directly by common pdb viewers such as rasmol  <cit> . an index of reliability of the model is provided in the remark fields of the pdb files. the index is an estimate of the tm score  <cit>  of the model against the true structure, based on: the degree to which the model enforces the various predicted constraints; the size and estimated secondary structure composition of the query; the absence or presence  of sequence similarity between the query and entries in the pdb. the reliability index, a novel component of distill, is estimated by an artificial neural network trained in 5-fold cross-validation on  <dig> cα trace reconstructions from the s <dig> set.

if homology information from the pdb is detected and used, this is indicated in the text of the response  and in the remarks of the pdb files when these are present.

RESULTS
porter, tested by a rigorous 5-fold cross validation procedure on s <dig>  achieves 79% correct classification on the "hard" casp 3-class assignment   <cit> , and currently has the highest performance  of all servers tested by assessor eva  <cit> . when homology information from the pdb is available, porter's predictions are more reliable, up to over 90% correct  when templates with over 90% sequence similarity are available  <cit> , and about 88% for all residues for which any template information is available. this result is not surprising by itself because, although different programs for assigning secondary structure from the experimental structure often differ by up to 20%, once a semantics is chosen  it is possible to classify secondary structure almost perfectly  <cit> . that is, it is true that there is some ambiguity in the assignment of secondary structures, but this is in large part due to the different definitions of secondary structures by different automated assignment programs, and only by a smaller amount to actual uncertainties as to what the structure may be.

paleale's accuracy, measured on the same large, non-redundant set adopted to train porter  exceeds 53% correct 4-class classification, and roughly 80% 2-class classification . as in the case of porter, predictive accuracy improves significantly when homology information is available  <cit> , up to 70% correct prediction for the 4-class case and 87% for the 2-class one, when templates with over 90% sequence similarity are available, and roughly 65% for residues for which any kind of template information is available.

the accuracy of brownale, measured on s <dig>  is  <dig> % for the 4-class problem, and roughly 73% if the  <dig> classes are mapped into  <dig> . in both cases the classification performance of brownale is 16% above a base-line statistical predictor  <cit> .

tables  <dig> and  <dig> summarise the performances of xxstout measured on one fifth of the s <dig> set after the exclusion of proteins longer than  <dig> residues . performances are given for the protein length/ <dig> and protein length/ <dig> contacts with the highest probability, for sequence separations of at least  <dig>  at least  <dig>  and at least  <dig>  in casp style  <cit> . these performances compare favourably with the best predictors at the latest casp competition  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the servers we designed allow the annotation of protein sequences with a number of structural features which are at least partially orthogonal. given the speed of the underlying methods, large- or even genomic-scale predictions can be handled by our servers in response of users' queries – with up to  <dig>  residues handled in a single submission. up to  <dig>  queries per day can be processed by the servers based on their current implementation , and nearly  <dig>  tasks from  <dig> national or supernational domains have been served to date.

our servers provide fast, reliable prediction of protein structural features for the ab initio case, and allow fast, reliable, large-scale predictions of protein structures for the case in which some homology to the pdb is detectable.

we are in the process of: extending the use of homology information to all prediction stages; building a parallel pipeline to distill, for the case in which marginal similarity templates exist in the pdb for a query. training of the systems for the latter case is completed and we expect that the new pipeline will be running over the next few months, complementing the current system with high-throughput fold recognition facilities.

availability and requirements
the servers are freely available for academic users at the address . linux and windows binaries for all the servers are freely available for academic users upon request. the sets used for training, testing and benchmarking the servers  are available upon request.
