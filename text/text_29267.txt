BACKGROUND
human phospholipid scramblases  are type ii single pass transmembrane proteins involved in the ca2+ dependent atp independent translocation of phospholipids  across the lipid bilayer  <cit> . hplscr <dig> was first identified as a 37 kda integral membrane protein from human erythrocytes, which was capable of bidirectional scrambling of pls between two leaflets of the lipid bilayer when reconstituted into liposomes. the gene encoding hplscr <dig> was cloned, overexpressed and the recombinant hplscr <dig> exhibited low scrambling activity compared to that of erythrocyte pl scramblase  <cit> . five homologs of scramblases  have been identified so far. hplscr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were expressed in wide variety of tissues; whereas hplscr <dig> was found only in testis and hplscr <dig> has been shown only at mrna level  <cit> .

hplscr <dig> possesses a single transmembrane helix but can localize to both plasma membrane  and nucleus. it has been reported that scramblases destroy the lipid asymmetry in pm when intracellular ca2+ levels were elevated by  <dig> fold  <cit> . previous studies showed that phosphatidylserine  exposure during apoptotic conditions was directly related to hplscr <dig> expression levels and the amount of ps exposed to the cell surface could be manipulated by modifying the expression levels of hplscr <dig>  <cit> . subsequent reports have questioned the role of hplscr <dig> in ps exposure . recently, a member of ca2+ dependent ion channels, tmem16f, and members of xkr protein family were identified to be responsible for phospholipid scrambling in plasma membrane . these reports along with other unusual factors for pl translocators such as low molecular weight, single transmembrane domain and slow rate of pl scrambling in-vitro support the argument that hplscr <dig> may not be a true scramblase and can have varied roles within the cell apart from phospholipid scrambling.

hplscr <dig> is a multifunctional protein involved in several other cellular processes including cell signaling, cell proliferation, transcriptional regulation and antiviral defense . overexpression of hplscr <dig> in myeloid cells inhibited tumorigenesis and enhanced cell differentiation  <cit> . hplscr <dig> interacts with variety of signaling molecules such as epidermal growth factor receptor, c-abl, src kinase, shc and onzins . hplscr <dig> also interacts with nuclear proteins including importin-α and topoisomerase ii  <cit>  and was shown to exhibit high affinity to chromatin  <cit> . hplscr <dig> expression is strongly stimulated in response to interferons and viral infections  <cit> . interferons are well known to stimulate the expression of several nucleases as a part of antiviral defense  <cit> . hplscr <dig> inhibits hepatitis b virus replication partly by activating the jak/stat pathway  <cit> . hplscr <dig> interacts with human t-cell leukemia virus type- <dig>  and represses the tax-dependent transactivation during htlv- <dig> infection  <cit> .

hplscr <dig> is characterized by five distinct domains conserved across the species:  c- terminal helix that spans the plasma membrane and is responsible for activity;  cysteine palmitoylation motif which helps in anchoring the protein to the membrane;  nuclear localization signal which helps in nuclear transport;  an ef hand like ca2+ binding motif and  dna binding domain   <cit> . the ef hand like ca2+ binding motif is vital for ca2+ binding and scramblase activity of hplscr <dig>  mutations in this motif rendered the protein inactive as the protein lost its ability to bind to calcium  <cit> . in a previous study, we showed that apart from ca2+ binding to the ef-hand like motif, hplscr <dig> could also bind to a variety of metal ions including mg2+  <cit> . the dna binding domain was shown to bind with the promoter of inositol 3-phosphate receptor , enhancing the expression of ip3r  <cit> . recently we identified a unique n-terminal proline rich domain  in hplscr <dig> and showed that the prd is essential for the oligomerization and functional activation of hplscr <dig>  <cit> .

hplscr <dig> interacts with c-terminal domain  of topoisomerase iiα  and enhances its decatenation activity  <cit> . the mechanism of the enhancement of topo iiα catalytic activity by hplscr <dig> is not yet understood. we hypothesize that the mechanism of enhancement of the activity of topo iiα by hplscr <dig> could happen in two ways:  hplscr <dig> helps in unwinding or cleaving of catenated substrate for the topo iiα to subsequently decatenate;  hplscr <dig> might have independent nuclease properties that could compliment the decatenation activity of topo iiα.

based on the ability of hplscr <dig> to bind to dna and mg2+, cytoplasmic localization, stimulation by interferons, and enhancement of decatenation activity of topo iiα, we believed that hplscr <dig> could moonlight as a metal ion dependent nuclease. in this study, we have shown that recombinant hplscr <dig> exhibits nuclease properties contributing to a novel feature of this multifunctional protein.

decatenation assay for topo iiα in the presence of hplscr1
hplscr <dig> is known to interact and enhance the decatenation activity of topo iiα. hplscr <dig> could enhance the decatenation activity of topo iiα by either aiding in unwinding and cleaving of the substrate dna bound to topo iiα or could have independent nuclease properties which could compliment the decatenation activity of topo iiα. to understand the characteristics of this interaction, we performed decatenation assay for topo iiα in the presence of hplscr <dig>  when low amount  of hplscr <dig> was added, decatenation activity of topo iiα was enhanced  but when the hplscr <dig> concentration was increased , apart from enhancement of decatenation activity, a new distinct band was observed . this was further confirmed by performing the decatenation assay in the absence of topo iiα . results showed presence of the distinct band when only hplscr <dig> was added, thereby revealing that hplscr <dig> processes kdna independently of topo iiα and could possess nuclease properties .fig.  <dig> topo iiα decatenation assay in presence of hplscr <dig>  decatenation assay was performed for topoisomerase iiα in the presence of hplscr <dig> as described in 'methods'. 200 ng of kinetoplast dna  is treated with  <dig> u of topo iiα for 15 min at 37 °c and was then visualized on a 1 % agarose gel. control denotes negative control where only kdna is present. lane  <dig> and lane  <dig> corresponds to the decatenation assay performed with topo iiα pre-treated with  <dig> pmol of hplscr <dig> and  <dig> pmol of hplscr <dig> respectively. lane  <dig> corresponds to the decatenation assay in the absence of topo iiα where only hplscr <dig> was added to kdna



nuclease activity of hplscr1
in-vitro nuclease assays were done by incubating  <dig> pmol of hplscr <dig> with 200 ng of genomic dna as substrate for 60 min at 37 °c. yeast genomic dna and human genomic dna were used as substrates for the nuclease reaction . presence of nuclease activity was confirmed by the disappearance of the band implying that the dna was completely degraded when treated with hplscr <dig> as visualized on a 1 % agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide; 12 % native page was also used to better resolve the products formed during the nuclease reaction . hplscr <dig> incubated with genomic dna migrated with a retarded smear, thus confirming the nuclease activity of hplscr <dig>  nuclease reaction was then performed for different time periods  at 37 °c. time course study revealed that the degradation of dna happens as early as 10 min with the complete degradation at 60 min for 200 ng of dna . nuclease assay was also performed with total rna, plasmid dna and single stranded dna  as substrates. hplscr <dig> exhibited nuclease activity in dsdna, rna and but no nuclease activity was observed when treated with ssdna . interestingly, hplscr <dig> nicks the plasmid dna as evident from the figure as a single band is observed when plasmid dna is treated with hplscr <dig> . to further confirm that the purified protein is devoid of other contaminating proteins , pet 28a  vector without the insert was transformed in e. coli and the purification protocol was repeated as described earlier. sds-page analysis did not reveal any contaminating proteins in the negative control and the resulting sample did not have any nuclease activity . this revealed that the recombinant hplscr <dig> is not contaminated with host proteins, which could contribute to the nuclease activity of hplscr <dig> fig.  <dig> nuclease properties of hplscr <dig>  a nuclease assay for hplscr <dig> with yeast and human genomic dna : nuclease assay was performed as described in ‘methods’ section.  <dig> pmol of hplscr <dig>  was treated with 200 ng of yeast and human genomic dna  in assay buffer at 37 °c for 60 min and visualized on 1 % agarose gel with ethidium bromide. b native page for visualization of nuclease activity : 200 ng of human genomic dna was incubated with hplscr <dig> at 37 °c for 60 min and visualized on a 12 % native page stained with  <dig>  μg/ml ethidium bromide. ‘ladder’ denotes 1 kb ladder. c time dependent nuclease activity of hplscr <dig> : hplscr <dig>  was incubated with human genomic dna  at 37 °c for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  90 min along with a no-enzyme control  and visualized on 1 % agarose gel with ethidium bromide. d effect of substrates on nuclease activity : nuclease assays were performed with 200 ng of plasmid dna and total rna as substrates along with a no-enzyme control visualized on a 1 % agarose gel. e nuclease activity of hplscr <dig> with ssdna : nuclease assays were performed with 200 ng of a random ssdna  and dsdna  along with a no-enzyme control containing both the substrates and visualized on a 2 % agarose gel



to reconfirm this, nuclease assay and kunitz assay  was performed with heat inactivated and trypsin treated hplscr <dig> and results confirmed that nuclease activity was protein mediated as the genomic dna was not degraded when trypsin digested or heat inactivated protein was used for the nuclease reaction . nuclease assay and kunitz assay was performed with increasing hplscr <dig> concentrations . results clearly explained that there is a dose dependent increase in the nuclease activity confirming that the nuclease reaction is dependent on the concentration of hplscr <dig> .fig.  <dig> nuclease activity is protein mediated. a, b nuclease assay upon protein inactivation: gel assay  and kunitz assay  were performed with heat-inactivated and trypsin digested hplscr <dig>  along with native hplscr <dig>  and a no enzyme control . c effect of hplscr <dig> concentration on nuclease activity : 200 ng of human genomic dna was incubated with various concentrations of hplscr <dig>  at 37 °c for 60 min and visualized on a 1 % agarose gel stained with  <dig>  μg/ml ethidium bromide. ‘control’ denotes negative control. d kunitz assay was performed for varying concentrations of hplscr <dig> as described above. * denotes statistical significance at p <  <dig> , ** denotes statistical significance at p <  <dig> ; ns – not significant. experiments were performed in triplicates and error bars denote standard deviation

nuclease reactions were set up in the presence of different metal ions like ca2+, mg2+ and zn2+. hplscr <dig> exhibited a maximum activity of  <dig>  u/mg in the presence of mg2+, whereas a 70 % decrease in activity was observed with zn2+ and no activity was observed in the presence of ca2+ . different concentrations  of ca2+, mg2+ and zn2+ were tested for nuclease activity. calcium did not exhibit activity at any concentration  whereas there was no significant change in nuclease activity values with increasing concentrations of mg2+ and zn2+ .fig.  <dig> effect of metal ions on nuclease activity of hplscr <dig>  a gel assay: hplscr <dig> was incubated with human genomic dna in the presence of 10 mm of cacl <dig>  mgcl <dig> and zncl <dig> at 37 °c for 60 min and visualized on a 1 % agarose gel. b metal ions effect on nuclease activity : nuclease activity was calculated from kunitz assay done for 10 mm of cacl <dig>  mgcl <dig> and zncl <dig> or in the absence of metal ions. c dose dependence of mgcl <dig> and zncl <dig> on nuclease activity of hplscr <dig>  kunitz assays were performed with 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm of mgcl <dig> and zncl <dig>  * denotes statistical significance at p <  <dig> , ** denotes statistical significance at p <  <dig> ; *** denotes statistical significance at p <  <dig> ; ns – not significant. experiments were performed in triplicates and error bars denote standard deviation



effect of protein modifying reagents on nuclease activity
hplscr <dig> was treated with 4 mm of amino acid modifiers – nem , depc , aebsf  and pg  and checked for nuclease activity . among all those tested, depc treated hplscr <dig> showed 51 % inhibition  whereas pg and nem showed  <dig> and 45 % inhibition when compared to the untreated hplscr <dig>  this suggests that histidine, cysteine and arginine residues are crucial for nuclease activity. aebsf did not inhibit the nuclease activity indicating that serine does not affect the nuclease activity. a dose dependent inhibition was observed when hplscr <dig> was treated with increasing concentrations of depc . when the nuclease assay was performed for an incubation time of 60 min, depc exhibited more inhibition than any other reagent, which is in accordance with specific activity values . in the absence of depc, complete degradation of dna similar to untreated sample was observed. in the presence of depc, the reaction was inhibited as seen by the smeared dna in the depc lane compared to the disappearance of band in the other amino acid modifiers. based on kunitz and gel assay results, it was found that depc showed the most inhibition among the tested amino acid modifiers.fig.  <dig> effect of amino acid modifying reagents on nuclease activity of hplscr <dig>  a kunitz assay: kunitz assay was used to calculate specific activity of hplscr <dig>  treated with 4 mm of each of the amino acid modifiers including nem, pg, depc, aebsf along with native hplscr <dig> . graph shows the percentage activity of modifier treated hplscr <dig> compared to the untreated hplscr <dig>  b depc dose dependence studies on nuclease activity: kunitz assays were used to calculate specific activity of hplscr <dig> treated with an increasing concentration of depc  and plotted. c effect of protein modifying reagents on nuclease activity : nuclease assays for hplscr <dig> treated with 4 mm of nem, aebsf, depc, and pg at 37 °c for 60 min were visualized in 1 % agarose gel. * denotes statistical significance at p <  <dig> , ** denotes statistical significance at p <  <dig> ; ns – not significant. experiments were performed in triplicates and error bars denote standard deviation



role of histidine residues in nuclease activity of hplscr1

hplscr <dig> is a multifunctional protein involved in several key cellular pathways such as cell cycle, apoptosis, ca2+ homeostasis. in this study, we demonstrated that hplscr <dig> possesses novel function of nuclease activity for the first time. finding the physiological implications of the nuclease activity of hplscr <dig> could pave way to identify new roles for hplscr <dig> in several cellular processes. even though hplscr <dig> was reported to enhance the decatenation activity of topo iiα, the underlying mechanism is not yet deciphered. hplscr <dig> could either  alter the structure of topo iiα thereby leading to an increase in the catalytic activity;  help in unwinding or cleaving of the dna substrate bound to topo iiα;  possess independent nuclease properties that aid in decatenation activity of topo iiα. to investigate this, the decatenation assay was performed with topo iiα pretreated with  <dig> pmol and  <dig> pmol of hplscr <dig>  at low amounts of hplscr <dig>  we observed enhancement of decatenation activity similar to previous report  <cit> . when  <dig> pmol of hplscr <dig> was used in the decatenation assay, a distinct band was observed along with the decatenation products of topo iiα. the appearance of this unique band was further confirmed by performing the decatenation assay with hplscr <dig> in the absence of topo iiα explaining that apart from enhancing the decatenation activity of topoisomerases, hplscr <dig> could independently possess nuclease properties which could aid in the enhancing the catalytic activity of topo iiα. topo iiα is known to interact with cad nuclease and is involved in chromatic condensation. the cad nuclease apart from digesting dna during apoptotic execution, it also interacts with topo iiα and enhances the decatenation activity of topo iiα in vitro  <cit> . in another report, topo iiβ interacts with an extracellular nuclease in mammalian spermatozoa and the interaction enhances the decatenation activity of topo iiβ  <cit> . similarly, we believed that hplscr <dig> could have nuclease properties, which could be the reason for enhancement of decatenation activity of topo iiα in vitro. to support this hypothesis, sequence alignment of hplscr <dig> with known nucleases with bioinformatics tools revealed some key findings. prd of hplscr <dig> has vast similarities with the prd of trex <dig>  a mammalian member of dnaq-like 3′–5′ exonuclease family  <cit> . trex <dig> exonuclease activity is supported by a metal ion catalyzed phosphoryl transfer mechanism. trex <dig> constitutes about  <dig> prolines and its prd contains about  <dig> prolines, which are involved in interactions with various protein complexes  <cit> . sequence analysis showed that about  <dig> out of  <dig> prolines in prd of hplscr <dig> were aligned and  <dig> prolines of trex <dig> prd exactly corresponded with prd of hplscr <dig> . the mg2+ binding site  in human flap endonuclease i , a protein involved in dna replication and repair was also conserved in hplscr <dig> . the bold characters in the sequence indicate the residues involved in mg2+ binding in fen <dig>  which are conserved in hplscr <dig>  hence, these striking similarities along with various other factors in the literature such as mg2+ binding, up regulation by interferons, involvement during apoptosis, interaction and enhancement of decatenation activity of topo iiα and processing of kdna even in absence of topo iiα intrigued us to elucidate the unique property of hplscr <dig> as a nuclease.

purified recombinant hplscr <dig> exhibited a dose dependent nuclease activity when incubated with yeast genomic dna and human genomic dna at 37 °c. overexpression and purification was repeated for e. coli cells transformed with pet 28a  vector without any insert . no distinct bands were revealed in sds-page analysis of the vector-purified protein and the samples did not show any nuclease activity . a random 37 kda protein that was purified by the same protocol as mentioned in ‘methods’ was also tested as a negative control to eradicate the possibilities of a co-purified contaminating host nuclease because of the purification protocol . absence of nuclease activity in vector-purified sample and in random protein clearly states that the nuclease activity is borne only by hplscr <dig> and not by other host contaminating nucleases. hplscr <dig> was active at temperatures between  <dig> and 45 °c , where a temperature of 37 °c was found to be optimum for its activity, which was similar for many other human nucleases such as trex <dig>  flap endonuclease  <dig>  and dnase  <dig>  the optimal ph for nuclease activity was found to be between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>   suggesting that hplscr <dig> probably acts as an alkaline nuclease. most of the nonspecific nucleases such as trex <dig> and fen <dig> had highest activity at  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . this was further confirmed by assaying nuclease activity with various substrates such as ssdna, dsdna and rna. hplscr <dig> exhibited nuclease activity towards dsdna and rna but not ssdna. hplscr <dig> exhibited nicking activity towards plasmid dna which could explain that hplscr <dig> might be a nicking endonuclease which needs to be further investigated. trex- <dig> digests ssdna and dsdna with mismatched 3′ termini  <cit> . these findings suggest that hplscr <dig> is a non-specific alkaline nuclease.

majority of nucleases require metal ions such as mg2+, ca2+ and zn2+ for their activity. metal ions in nucleases are found to play a dual role:  enhancing the affinity of the substrate to the enzyme which could be sequence or structure specific and  directly involved in catalysis where the phosphate oxygen bond is cleaved  <cit> . to verify the specificity of metal ions for nuclease activity of hplscr <dig>  assays were performed with ca2+, zn2+ and mg2+ . ca2+ did not induce nuclease activity, which was astonishing as ca2+ binding is vital for the pl translocation by hplscr <dig> across the lipid bilayer. it was found that mg2+ and zn2+ stimulated nuclease activity and might possibly play a role in stabilizing the enzyme structure apart from catalysis. hplscr <dig> has an ef hand like ca2+ binding motif and point mutations in the d <dig> resulted in loss of calcium binding and scramblase activity  <cit> . we also reported that mg2+ binds to the ef hand like ca2+ binding motif in hplscr <dig>   <cit> . hence to understand the metal binding properties of hplscr <dig>  d275a point mutant of hplscr <dig> was generated and checked for scramblase activity and nuclease activity. the mutant d275a-hplscr <dig> showed a complete loss of scramblase activity, but the nuclease activity was not affected . this could possibly explain that mg2+ could have a binding site other than the ef-hand like motif which remains to be investigated. further studies should be performed to understand the mechanism of mg2+ interaction with hplscr <dig> 

protein modification experiments revealed that histidine, cysteine and arginine residues in hplscr <dig> were important for nuclease activity. histidines and cysteines are the most commonly occurring active site residues in nucleases. in a similar study, depc modification of cad nuclease inhibited the nuclease activity. cad nuclease has two histidine residues at its active site that is essential for its nuclease activity. the active site of cad possesses two histidine residues and depc modification inactivated the enzyme  <cit> . based on our results, we generated a histidine point mutant  where all the histidine residues in hplscr <dig> were mutated to alanine. mut-hplscr <dig> showed a threefold decrease in nuclease activity only when assayed at 20- <dig> pmol and showed statistically insignificant activity at lower concentrations . this confirms that the nuclease activity is only by hplscr <dig> and eliminates the possibility of co-purification of a host contaminating nuclease. histidine could be involved either in the catalytic site or for stabilizing the enzyme substrate complex which needs to be further investigated.

the mechanism and the physiological role of the nuclease property of hplscr <dig> in normal and pathological conditions remain to be investigated. in a recent report, hplscr <dig> was shown to be induced and localized to pm and periplasmic region upon dsdna transfection in normal immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells  <cit> . the physiological relevance of this marked induction is not yet identified. since it is already well documented that hplscr <dig> is a part of interferon mediated anti-viral defense, the induced hplscr <dig> during dsdna transfection might have a role as a nuclease in defense against foreign dna.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this is the first report showing a novel mg2+ dependent activity of hplscr <dig>  the nuclease activity was strictly metal dependent and could act on dsdna, rna but not ssdna as substrates. depc treated hplscr <dig> exhibited reduced nuclease activity and further mutation of histidines resulted in a 60 % loss of activity. histidines could play a critical role in nuclease activity of hplscr <dig>  further studies are required to ascertain the exact mechanism of nuclease activity, critical residues involved in catalysis, mg2+ binding, substrate binding and the physiological relevance for nuclease activity of hplscr <dig>
