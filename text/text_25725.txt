BACKGROUND
ceratocystis cacaofunesta is an ascomycete fungus  that causes wilt disease in cacao . this fungus is a member of the latin american clade of the ceratocystis fimbriata complex  <cit> , a taxonomic group that includes species with high genetic variability and wide host ranges  <cit> . these species cause canker and wilt diseases in many economically important crops, such as coffea arabica and eucalyptus spp. <cit> . engelbrecht and harrington  <cit>  proposed that host specialization may influence speciation in this group.

c. cacaofunesta is indigenous to central and south america  <cit> . in brazil, this pathogen was first reported in the amazon region  <cit> . in the 1990s, c. cacaofunesta was introduced to the southern region of bahia, which is the largest brazilian cacao-producing state  <cit> . this fungus is able to penetrate cacao trees through stem wounds that are caused either by insects  or through infected cutting tools  <cit> . unlike other cacao diseases that primarily affect branches and fruits, such as witches’ broom disease and frosty pod, wilt disease is a systemic infection that damages the entire plant. the fungus enters its host through the secondary xylem, resulting in the formation of deep spots and leading to the obstruction of water and nutrient transport  <cit> . consequently, the plant turns yellow and then brown; the infection culminates in the wilting and sudden death of the tree. this disease is responsible for reductions in the cacao population in plantation areas, which has resulted in great economic losses in the affected regions. extensive damages have also been reported in trinidad  <cit> , venezuela and colombia  <cit> .

several studies have attempted to characterize the genetic variation, aggressiveness and host specialization of different populations of c. fimbriata complex including c cacaofunesta <cit> . however, little is known at the molecular level regarding this fungus and its interaction with cacao. notably, no genomic data are available for any members of the ceratocystis genus. in  <dig>  our group initiated the c. cacaofunesta genome project , with the goal of understanding the mechanisms that underlie the interactions between c. cacaofunesta and theobroma cacao in the development of wilt disease. we initially focused on the study of c. cacaofunesta mitochondria for two reasons:  their potential role in fungal pathogenesis and  the relevance of this organelle as a target for fungicides  <cit> .

in addition to their canonical function as an energy-producing compartment, mitochondria are involved in multiple cellular processes  <cit> . these organelles play important roles in calcium homeostasis  <cit> , the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters  <cit> , lipid and amino acid metabolism, aging and the signaling of programmed cell death  <cit> . due to the importance of these processes, mitochondrial dysfunctions cause serious consequences for the cell and, ultimately, the entire organism. functionally compromised mitochondria are associated with senescence in non-pathogenic fungi, such as podospora anserina <cit>  and n. crassa <cit> .

mitogenomics has become a useful tool for evolutionary studies  <cit> , and the continuous advances in this field have contributed to the understanding of the diverse topology, organization and structure of mtdna in fungi  <cit> . however, as mtdna encodes approximately 1% of the mitochondrial proteome, scant information concerning the roles of mitochondria in the metabolism, development and lifestyle of organisms has been gleaned from exclusive analyses of the mitochondrial genome. fungal mtdna generally contains  <dig> genes that encode hydrophobic subunits of the respiratory chain complexes, two genes that encode ribosomal rnas  and genes that encode a full set of trnas  <cit> . the other 99% of the mitochondrial proteome is encoded by nuclear dna and imported into the mitochondria  <cit> . nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins  are produced by cytosolic ribosomes and are targeted to the proper mitochondrial subcompartment  <cit> .

to understand mitochondrial function, studies using genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches have been performed in several types of organisms, such as fungi  <cit> , plants  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . the first mitochondrial analysis using integrative proteomic and genomic approaches in fungi was conducted in s. cerevisiae <cit> . by overcoming the individual limitations of each technique, this integrative study produced a powerful tool for the prediction of mitochondrial processes in yeast. the s. cerevisiae mitochondrial proteome contains an estimated  <dig>  proteins, of which  <dig> were identified using proteomic assays  <cit> . in n. crassa, proteomic studies have led to the identification of  <dig> mitochondrial proteins  <cit> . proteomics has previously been used to illuminate central processes in phytopathogenic fungi  <cit> . certain more recent studies have analyzed of mycelial, conidiospores and haustoria proteomes  <cit> , fungal secretomes and proteomes that are associated with fungal virulence  <cit> . however, the mitochondrial proteomes of phytopathogenic fungi have not been explored.

in the present study, we performed a global analysis of c. cacaofunesta mitochondria using an integrative approach . we predicted the c. cacaofunesta mitochondrial proteome , including mitochondrial-encoded proteins and mitochondrial proteins encoded in the nuclear genome . moreover, 27% of predicted mtprot was validated by experimental proteome analysis . we focused on comparisons with available mitochondrial proteomes from non-pathogenic model fungi to increase our knowledge on the role of mitochondria in pathogenicity. the present study is the first partial genomic analysis of a ceratocystis species to be published. additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this study is pioneering in that it presents a global analysis of the mitochondrial proteome of a phytopathogenic fungus using this integrative approach.

RESULTS
c. cacaofunesta mitochondrial genome structure
the complete mitochondrial genome of ceratocystis cacaofunesta was assembled with  <dig> -fold coverage as a single circular molecule comprising  <dig>  bp . it is the fourth largest published fungal mitochondrial genome, and the second largest among the sordariomycetes, after that of chaetomium thermophylum   <cit> . however, the differences in the sizes of fungal mitochondrial genomes are not correlated with differences in their number of conserved genes  <cit> . therefore, c. cacaofunesta mtdna contains  <dig> genes that encode the conserved proteins nadh dehydrogenase subunits  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> l ; cytochrome c oxidase subunits i, ii and iii ; atp synthase subunits  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ; apocytochrome b ; and the ribosomal protein s <dig> , . with the exception of rps <dig>  all of these conserved genes are involved in oxidative phosphorylation and atp synthesis. genes that encode the small and large rrna subunits  were also identified. the rps <dig> gene is located within a group i intron  of the rnl gene, as has been described for many other sordariomycetes  <cit> . it has been proposed that the structure of one gene  within another  guarantees that they are co-transcribed and that the stoichiometry of the two components is adequate for ribosome biogenesis  <cit> . in addition to rrna and conserved coding genes, the trnascan-se program  <cit>  identified  <dig> putative trnas for the  <dig> standard amino acids and a possible suppressor trna . all of the trnas, rrnas and protein-coding genes are oriented in the same direction . also, the conserved genes are organized in the same four synthetics units described for sordariomycetes <cit> , except by minor changes in trn genes distribution. the gene pair nad2-nad <dig> is partially overlapping as the nad <dig> orf extends  <dig> nucleotides into the nad <dig> reading frame . it has been proposed that the preservation of syntenic units could play a functional role, enabling the polycistronic transcription of these genes  <cit> .

the annotation of the c. cacaofunesta mt genome revealed that introns form  <dig> % of this dna molecule, explaining its large size. the invasion of mitochondrial genes by group i introns is a primary reason for the wide variation in fungal mitochondrial genome sizes   <cit> . a total of  <dig> mitochondrial group i introns, with an average size of  <dig>  bp, were identified in the conserved coding and rrna genes. these introns are distributed within conserved genes throughout the c. cacaofunesta mitochondrial genome, with cox <dig> harboring the largest number of these elements  . cox <dig> has been described as a reservoir for mitochondrial group i introns in fungi, harboring as many as  <dig> of these elements in agaricus bisporus <cit> . of the total of mitochondrial group i interns,  <dig> encoded homing endonuclease genes  . the dynamic properties of these introns suggest that they can be moved into other regions of the genome and between the genomes of phylogenetically distant species  <cit> .

although the presence of mitochondrial plasmids is a common feature of sordariomycetes, such as g. zeae <cit> , n. crassa <cit> and p. anserine <cit> , no integrated or free linear mitochondrial plasmids were identified in the c. cacaofunesta mtdna. however, a pseudogene with similarity to the rna polymerase  of the p. anserina mitochondrial plasmid pal2- <dig> was identified downstream of the cox <dig> gene . the presence of this pseudogene with plasmidial origin suggests an ancestral plasmid insertion in this region. we found no evidence of inverted repeats flanking this pseudogene.

the analysis of the c. cacaofunesta mtdna also revealed an average of  <dig> % g+c residues, which were uniformly distributed throughout the sequence . the intronic orfs exhibited a slightly lower gc content  than did the conserved genes . moreover, a gc skew analysis was performed, and the shift points of the gc skew graphs were consistent with the loci of the origin  and termination  of replication in bacteria  <cit>  and certain fungi  <cit> .

predicted mitochondrial proteome and annotation
considering that approximately 99% of the mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus  <cit>  and that we have the complete genome sequences of c. cacaofunesta, we estimated the total mitochondrial proteome of c. cacaofunesta based on the numbers of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded proteins.

the use of these combined approaches generated a predicted mitochondrial proteome for c. cacaofunesta that consisted of  <dig>  polypeptides, with  <dig>  nmp and  <dig> mitochondrial-encoded proteins. of the total proteins,  <dig> were identified using the predictor softwares ,  <dig> were identified only by homology analysis and  <dig> were identified using both methods . the predicted c. cacaofunesta mtprot has a similar size to the mtprot that was estimated for s. cerevisiae   <cit> ; whereas the a. thaliana mtprot is estimated to contain approximately  <dig> polypeptides  <cit> , and the mouse mtprot contains about  <dig>  polypeptides  <cit> .

the predicted mtprot of c. cacaofunesta was annotated using autofact  <cit>  to summarize the results of the blast  <cit>  searches of the nr/ncbi, kegg  <cit>  and uniref <dig> databases  <cit> . an independent search of the cdd  database  <cit>  was also performed. the blast2go  <cit>  program was used to produce gene ontology  classification . table  <dig> summarizes the main results of annotation. from the predicted mtprot,  <dig> codifying genes result in no hits in autofact. these genes were collectively annotated as hypothetical unconserved genes. three hundred forty-nine other genes were similar only with genomic sequences and/or predict hypothetical proteins; these genes were therefore annotated as hypothetical conserved genes. lastly, the remaining  <dig> genes are similar to at least one other known  gene in the databases that were used for autofact annotation and were therefore considered to be known conserved genes. the go annotation assigned  <dig> proteins to at least one level of ontology . a total of  <dig> enzymes were identified by blast2go, from which,  <dig> were distributed in  <dig> metabolic pathways. the most represented metabolic pathway were nitrogen metabolism  and oxidative phosphorylation . additional file  <dig> shows the entire catalogue of predicted c. cacaofunesta mitochondrial proteins and their respective annotation.

transcriptomic analysis
a global analysis of the c. cacaofunesta transcriptome was performed using large-scale mrna sequencing , as described in the corresponding section of methods. this technique is widely used to analyze gene expression and to validate gene predictions  <cit> . this methodology was recently used to analyze mitochondrial gene expression  <cit> . approximately  <dig> million of reads were generated in two biological replicates . as expected, only a very small number of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes  . the rnaseq methodology used here requires a mrna polya tail, but rnas that are transcribed from fungal mtdnas generally lack this feature. polyadenylation of mitochondrial mrna appears to be restricted to higher eukaryotes  <cit> . therefore, the  <dig>  rnaseq reads aligned with c. cacaofunesta mtdna most likely represents artifacts.

genes with rpkm <  <dig> were considered to not be expressed. among the total reads that mapped to nuclear genes  <dig> %  align with genes that encode mitochondrial proteins . this result indicates that the average expression of genes that encode nmps is approximately  <dig>  times greater than the expression of the other nuclear genes  . of the  <dig>  nmp genes, only  <dig> presented rpkm values of less than  <dig>  and  <dig> had rpkm values greater than  <dig> . more highly expressed genes are involved in protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation, which is consistent with the high rates of fungal growth in the culture conditions. approximately 99% of the nmp codifying genes are expressed. rnaseq also aids in the identification of new genes. based on our prediction, a total of  <dig> novel putative genes encode mitochondrial proteins. however, rnaseq analysis indicated that only  <dig> of these are expressed  .transcriptomic information consists of the complete set of transcripts and their abundance in the cell in specific physiological conditions  <cit> . therefore, the transcriptome of fungi in vitro may be quite different when compared with the transcriptome of fungi during its interaction with its host. although we are unable to make conclusions regarding expression profile of c. cacaofunesta genes during pathogenesis based on these data, the transcriptome analysis of c. cacaofunesta mitochondrial genes in vitro provides valuable information with respect to validating gene prediction, including the discovery of  <dig> novel putative genes.

experimental mitochondrial proteome
the isolated mitochondrial proteome was electrophoretically separated on a  <dig> % sds-page gel, and  <dig> bands were excised from the gel and subjected to lc-ms/ms analysis in the corresponding section . a total of  <dig>  ms/ms spectra were generated and confidently assigned to  <dig> unique proteins with statistically significant  mascot-based scores and a  <dig> % fdr . among the  <dig> proteins that were identified using lc-ms/ms, the  <dig> most abundant proteins presented more than  <dig> spectral counts in both samples . the size of these proteins ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> kda, and there was not a molecular weight bias in their abundance.

among the total proteins that were identified using lc-ms/ms, 64%  were contained within the predicted mtprot . this result indicates that approximately 27% of the predicted mtprot was experimentally validated. accordingly, the mitochondrial proteome analysis by lc-ms/ms is capable of identifying 23%-40% of the known mitochondrial proteins but does not capture low-abundance proteins  <cit> , except for proteins that are produced under specific circumstances  <cit> . experimental mitochondrial proteome analysis of n. crassa has identified  <dig> proteins that correspond to  <dig> unique genes; these represent 20% of the total mtprot that has been described for this species  <cit> .

of the  <dig> predicted mitochondrial proteins that were validated by lc-ms/ms, we identified  <dig> mitochondrial-encoded conserved proteins  and an intronic orf . table  <dig> lists a subset of the experimentally identified nmp proteome that was associated with important metabolic process. according with transcriptome analysis, the set of experimentally identified proteins reflects the metabolic status of the fungal cell in rich growth conditions.

remarkably, we identified  <dig> conserved hypothetical proteins and  <dig> novel protein in the experimental proteome that exhibited putative mitochondrial localization . we believe that these results are an important contribution because they give the first experimental evidence of the existence of these putative mitochondrial proteins. the functional characterization of these proteins and their association with particular mitochondrial pathways is a great challenge but could certainly improve our understanding of this organelle.

we also identified  <dig> proteins that were not predicted to be mitochondrial based on our analysis . manual annotation was used to elucidate the composition of this group of proteins. total number of mitochondrial proteins identified using lc-ms/ms could reach  <dig> , representing 81% of the total experimental proteome. this result indicates that the enriched-mitochondrial preparation of c. cacaofunesta was performed with high efficiency. however, the standard methodology chosen here was automatic annotation due to the high stringency of the parameters; hence, the  <dig> proteins that were classified as putative mitochondrial based on manual annotation were not included in the final catalogue of mitochondrial proteins that are proposed here. the experimental proteome was used to validate a fraction of predicted proteome, focusing on the identification of hypothetical and novel proteins.

one of the main contributions of this study is the experimental identification of two groups of predicted mitochondrial proteins with no assigned function:  proteins for which there was no experimental evidence  and  novel proteins. table  <dig> shows the total of proteins of groups  and  based both on the predicted and the experimental proteomes. of the  <dig> predicted hypothetical proteins,  <dig> were identified by mass spectrometry, as mentioned above. with respect to group , the predicted mtprot identified  <dig> novel putative proteins. however, rnaseq confirmed the expression of  <dig> of them, and one protein was identified experimentally. the  <dig> hypothetical proteins that were identified by mass spectrometry were reclassified as conserved unknown function . the s. cerevisiae mitochondrion is the best-understood and characterized molecularly  <cit> . however, approximately 19% of the identified proteins remain have no known function  <cit> . the predicted c. cacaofunesta mtprot contains approximately 34% of proteins with unknown function. these data suggest that we are far from fully understanding the function of this organelle, a fact that reflects its functional plasticity. further functional characterization of these proteins may enable a better understanding of mitochondrial function. it is important to highlight that there are more than  <dig> known sordariomycetes genomes published, and we suggest that the  <dig> predicted novel genes  may be specific to this species. moreover, it is very likely that these proteins are shared with other species from the ceratocystis fimbriata complex, a hypothesis that will investigated with the upcoming availability of other ceratocystis genomes. our results provide a framework for examining the involvement of novel proteins in mitochondrial pathways.

the functional annotation of the c. cacaofunesta mitochondrial proteome and a comparison with those of s. cerevisiae and n. crassa
we focused on the go annotation to perform a global function analysis of the predicted c. cacaofunesta proteome. putative functions were assigned to the predicted mtprot using go and were manually grouped into  <dig> categories according to biological process. only the amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism categories were queried using specific go ids: go: <dig>  go: <dig> and go: <dig>  respectively. the remaining  <dig> categories included several related go ids . the go distribution is shown in figure  <dig>  together with the go distributions of n. crassa and s cerevisiae mtprot. the largest go category is “other” , which was expected given that it contained proteins from  <dig> small categories . the second-most represented category is “genome maintenance and transcription”, which includes  <dig> % of all of the predicted mitochondrial proteins. based on sequence, approximately 19% of the mtprot are related to protein metabolism, and  <dig> % of them are assigned to “transport of metabolites”. this latter category includes atp-binding cassette  transporters, ion transport families, protein transporters and other metabolite transporters. more than  <dig> % of the proteins were directly involved in energy metabolism, including parts of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery , members of the tricarboxylic acid cycle , and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex . among underrepresented categories were the following:  response to stimulus and  signaling, which included  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all of the predicted mitochondrial proteins, respectively . at  <dig> %, lipid metabolism was the smallest category represented in the c. cacaofunesta mtprot.

we used the same go categorization criteria as above to annotate the s. cerevisiae and n. crassa mitochondrial proteomes  <cit>  to compare their global functional profiles to that from c. cacaofunesta . due to the redundancy of go categories associated with a same protein, it is difficult to perform a statistical analysis of these data. however, figure  <dig> clearly shows that there is a similar pattern to the distribution of mitochondrial proteins in different go functional categories among the three species. considering the important role of mitochondrial function to basic cell metabolism, the conservation of core mitochondrial functions is expected  <cit> . however, it is known that the expansion or reduction in the size of individual protein families, and hence individual functions, plays a specific role in lifecycle of the organism. in phytopathogenic fungi, differences in protein families have been associated with the importance of the related functions in plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . considering that c. cacaofunesta is a phytopathogenic fungus and that s. cerevisiae and n. crassa are non-pathogenic, it would be plausible to expect more differences between these species regarding the distribution of proteins in functional categories that are related to transport of metabolites, signaling, and defense  <cit> . however, no such major differences were identified. according the most recent publication on the subject, certain categories that were represented in this analysis, such as signaling, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, protein transport and protein folding, have similar protein percentages as those that have been described for the s. cerevisiae mtprot  <cit> . these results suggest that the involvement of the mitochondria in virulence and pathogenicity may rely on specific proteins and/or in the convergence in time and space of different components.

the same go categorization was performed using the experimental proteome. for this purpose, the  <dig> proteins with potential mitochondrial localizations that had been identified using lc-ms/ms were subjected to a go analysis . the results shown in figure  <dig> revealed that the categories most strongly represented in the experimental proteome were transport of metabolites , energy metabolism  and protein metabolism . the classifications of the experimental proteins reflect the c. cacaofunesta culture conditions . the fungus grows rapidly, suggesting an intense metabolism, including the synthesis of enzymes and the import of proteins and metabolites. moreover, the availability of glucose as the primary carbon source likely enhanced the expression of genes that are involved in energy metabolism. vodisch and coworkers  examined the mtprot of aspergillus nidulans as a part of the global fungal proteome  <cit> . these authors observed a clear relationship between the culture conditions and the enriched classes of experimentally identified proteins.

notably, the global analysis of the c. cacaofunesta mitochondrial function that was based on functional classification  of the experimentally identified proteins  reflects the functional grouping of the full set of predicted mitochondrial proteins . considering that we performed mass spectrometry only for fungi in cultured conditions, which appears to be far from mimicking fungal growth in nature, the similarity of functions between the predicted and experimental proteomes reinforces the importance of the core mitochondrial functions. additionally, this similarity suggests that the mitochondrial role in the adaptation of the fungus to certain growth conditions, including the environment of its host, depends of specific sets of proteins, pathways and/or differential gene regulation rather than on major changes in mitochondrial function.

c. cacaofunesta global proteome survey
it is well established that mitochondrial function is important for the virulence and pathogenicity of fungi  <cit> . here, we demonstrated that the global proteome compositions of s. cerevisiae, n. crassa and c. cacaofunesta do not contain major differences. however, of these three fungi, c. cacaofunesta is the only pathogenic fungus, which prompted us to perform a more detailed investigation of its proteome composition.

early stages of necrotrophic infections, like those caused by c. cacaofunesta, are associated with host cell death, the production of secondary metabolites and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . mitochondrial proteins that are associated with detoxification may play an important role in the success of pathogen colonization. we therefore analyzed the predicted mtprot of c. cacaofunesta to identify proteins that may play important roles in pathogenicity and sensitivity/resistance to fungicides.

we focused the search on proteins that have been previously related to virulence, specifically atp-binding cassette  transporters, aldehyde dehydrogenase, alternative nadh dehydrogenase, alternative oxidase, the mitochondrial carrier fow <dig>  glutathione s-transferase and hypoxia-related protein. figure  <dig> shows a schematic summary of a subset of the predicted proteins in the mtprot of c. cacaofunesta with potential involvement in the pathogenicity of this fungus.

the c. cacaofunesta predicted mtprot contains  <dig> proteins classified as abc transporters. all of the genes codifying these proteins were expressed under the tested conditions, with average rpkm values of  <dig>  and  <dig> . <dig>  mass spectrometry identified  <dig> of this class of transporters . the abc transporter of a nectria haematococca  proved to be an important virulence factor that contributes to the n. haematococca tolerance of phytoalexin during its interaction with the host  <cit> . furthermore, abc transporters have been associated with fungicide resistance  <cit> .

aldehyde dehydrogenase  has also been implicated in the pathogenicity of fungi. adh is regarded as a detoxification enzyme due to its role in the metabolism of intermediates and exogenous aldehydes  <cit> . an analysis of adh expression in clasdosporium fulvum, both in vitro and in vivo, during its interactions with tomato indicated that the expression of this gene was associated with infection and starvation conditions  <cit> . interestingly, the predicted c. cacaofunesta mtprot survey identified  <dig> adh-encoding genes with confirmed expression , and  <dig> adh proteins were identified by lc-ms/ms. moreover, glutathione s-transferases  are a large family of proteins that are involved in cellular detoxification processes during oxidative stress responses  <cit>  and may be involved in fungicide resistance  <cit> . mao and coworkers  suggested a link between the number of gst-encoding genes in the fungal genome and its lifecycle  <cit> . the predicted c. cacaofunesta mtprot contains  <dig> proteins that are homologous to gst. the rna-seq analysis indicated varying average expression levels, with rpkm values of as high as 150; one of those proteins was identified in the experimental proteome .

moreover, components of the alternative respiratory chain have been related to fungal pathogenicity, specifically alternative nadh dehydrogenase  <cit>  and alternative oxidase   <cit> . studies in which alternative nadh dehydrogenase was blocked in aspergillus niger demonstrated the role of this protein in protection against oxidative stress  <cit> . c. cacaofunesta has one encoded alternative nadh dehydrogenase gene with rpkm values > 60; this gene was also identified in the experimental proteome . moreover, the predicted mtprot included a putative aox. this enzyme has been implicated in fungal protection against oxidative stress, pathogenicity and fungicide resistance  <cit> . c. cacaofunesta aox was not identified in the experimental proteome, but the gene aox exhibited detectable expression, with a rpkm value of approximately  <dig> . recently, thomazella and coworkers  provided strong evidence for the involvement of aox in maintaining the infective phase of the basidiomycete moniliophthora perniciosa <cit> .

the deletion of a fusarium oxysporum mitochondrial carrier-encoding gene  caused the loss of its ability to infect plant tissues  <cit> . a putative fow <dig> protein was identified in the c. cacaofunesta predicted mtprot. the rna-seq data indicated that the fow <dig> homologue in c. cacaofunesta was highly expressed , and its product was identified in the experimental proteome .

it has been reported that the ability of certain fungi to withstand different levels of hypoxia is a critical virulence factor in terms of fungal pathogenicity in mammals  <cit> . hypoxia-related genes have been identified as important virulence factors for aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans given that they are exposed to low oxygen concentrations during infection  <cit> . oxygen levels in the secondary xylem, the plant tissue that is infected by c. cacaofunesta, are as low as are observed in human tissues that are infected by these fungal pathogens, reaching levels less than 5%  <cit> . this observation suggests c. cacaofunesta should possess mechanism with which to adapt to hypoxia. in this regard, the predicted c. cacaofunesta mtprot contains one protein that has a conserved hypoxia response domain. this gene was expressed in in vitro conditions, with an rpkm value as high as  <dig> and its product was also identified in the experimental proteome . although hypoxia response mechanisms are more complex and involve a series of regulatory pathways  <cit> , these results open the way for the exploration of the role of c. cacaofunesta mitochondria in fungal phytopathogens responses to hypoxia.

due to inherent limitations for each of the techniques that were used to predict the subcellular localization of proteins, we chose to perform a stringent integrative approach to predict the c. cacaofunesta mtprot. we therefore must state that the list of mitochondrial proteins proposed here as the predicted mitochondrial proteome of c. cacaofunesta may not correspond to the full set of mitochondrial polypeptides. this mtprot survey is a preliminary analysis due to the relatively small number of proteins discussed but reveals how these data can be exploited in future studies. the presented genome and estimated proteome data provide a starting point for the improved characterization of c. cacaofunesta mitochondrial function in two ways:  facilitating the identification of proteins that may be relevant to the lifestyle of this fungus and  expanding the literature that relates to studies of mitochondrial function and evolution to the discovery of new mitochondrial genes. in this regard, the identification of both conserved proteins with unknown function and novel proteins is particularly relevant. the comprehensive characterization of these proteins opens up exciting new opportunities for understanding the role of mitochondria in phytopathogenicity. due to the important role of this organelle in resistance/susceptibility to fungicides, this study could aid in the identification of more effective strategies by which to the control this fungus.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we performed a global analysis of c. cacaofunesta mitochondria using an integrative approach . we predicted the c. cacaofunesta mitochondrial proteome, including  <dig> mitochondrial encoded proteins and  <dig>  proteins encoded in the nuclear genome . all of the nmp  were transcribed in mycelia that were grown in vitro; approximately 27% of these genes were also identified by mass spectrometry. rnaseq analysis allowed to detected expression of  <dig> novel putative genes. the comparison of the global analysis of mitochondrial function between c. cacaofunesta, s. cerevisiae and n. crassa revealed that, in addition to the known involvement of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of fungi, the differences in the lifestyle of these organisms  are not accompanied by major differences in the functional composition of their mitochondrial proteomes. therefore, the relevance of this organelle in different fungi lifestyle could lie in a particular set of proteins and/or in a different pattern of gene regulation. in this regard, lc-ms analysis validated the existence of  <dig> proteins with unknown function, of which one is probably specific to this species and likely to the ceratocystis species complex. further functional characterization of these putative mitochondrial proteins could improve our understanding of the mitochondria’s role in fungal pathogenesis.
