BACKGROUND
the advent of next-generation sequencing technology has made it possible to gather large amounts of genomic information from non-model organisms at a fraction of the time and effort previously required  <cit> . transcriptome datasets  can provide a tractable entry into genomic analysis for species which do not have a close relative with a full genome sequence  <cit> . these datasets comprise a smaller subset of sequence, with fewer repetitive elements, intron or intragenic sequences that make assembly of full genomes difficult. transcriptomes thus require fewer computational resources for assembly than full genomes, can be annotated by comparison with protein sequences from even distantly related species, and have a high functional information content.

creation of a reference transcriptome can facilitate whole genome annotation, molecular marker development and studies of development or adaptation in non-model organisms. previous studies have used transcriptome datasets to identify candidate genes for biologically important traits  <cit> , genes involved in adaptation to specific environments  <cit> , and to develop microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism  markers for genomic mapping and population genetic surveys  <cit> .

the tuatara  is a species of extraordinary evolutionary and physiological interest, yet has few existing genomic resources. they are the only surviving member of the reptilian order rhynchocephalia , which diverged from other reptilian orders approximately  <dig> million years ago. rynchocephalids are regarded as the sister group of the squamates, based on morphological and genetic analyses  <cit>  and were globally widespread until the late cretaceous   <cit> .

in addition to being one of the most phylogenetically divergent vertebrate lineages, tuatara have several distinctive physiological traits which make them a useful model for studies of genome evolution and development. they have a rare pattern of temperature-dependent sex determination, where males are produced at high temperatures  <cit> ; an unusual thermal biology, being cold-adapted with a low optimal body temperature range for a reptile   <cit> ; and a low metabolic rate  <cit> . they are also extremely long-lived, probably living to over 100 years  <cit> , have a long generation time   <cit> , and a low reproductive output, with females reproducing only every four years on average  <cit> .

tuatara are now restricted to offshore islands around new zealand, and many populations are small, genetically distinct, and at risk of extinction  <cit> . climate change poses a particular risk to tuatara populations because of their cold-adapted metabolism and the likelihood of male-biased populations at higher temperatures  <cit> . establishing new populations is therefore a central part of tuatara conservation management  <cit> , but requires detailed information on the genetic relatedness of existing populations and adaptation to local environments. understanding local adaptation, including differences in disease resistance, thermal tolerance, and the interaction of temperature-dependent sex determination and nesting behaviour will be crucial to successful management of tuatara in the face of climate change.

interest in tuatara genomics is increasing and the construction of a tuatara bac library has facilitated initial characterisation and mapping of the tuatara genome  <cit> . a limited number of microsatellite, major histocompatibility complex and mitochondrial markers are available for tuatara  <cit> , but the species is still poorly characterised at the molecular level. prior to this study, only  <dig> partial or full mrna sequences for tuatara were available on genbank.

here we have used illumina sequencing to assemble a partial transcriptome dataset from a tuatara embryo. although most transcriptome studies from non-model organisms  have used  <dig> pyrosequencing because of the longer read length  produced from this type of sequencer, several recent studies have successfully performed de novo assembly of transcriptome data from illumina reads ranging from  <dig> to 100 bp in length  <cit> . although the read lengths produced are shorter, illumina sequencers produce more sequence, at lower cost, than the  <dig> platform  <cit> . the greater sequence coverage obtained with illumina facilitates the assembly of transcripts and enables rare transcripts to be identified. we assembled  <dig> million paired 50 bp reads into  <dig> contigs, almost half of which could be annotated by comparison with sequences in the ncbi nr or unigene databases. our primary goal was to produce a reference set of mrna sequences for tuatara, which will facilitate annotation of the tuatara genome and future studies of sex determination, local adaptation, genome evolution and population genetics of tuatara.

RESULTS
sequencing of tuatara embryo mrna on the illumina genome analyzer ii yielded a total of  <dig>  gbp of mrna sequence from approximately  <dig> million paired-end 50 bp reads. raw reads are available at the ncbi short read archive under accession number sra <dig> 

the q <dig> percentage , n percentage , and gc percentage for the raw reads was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. reads were quality filtered by trimming off bases with a phred quality score < <dig>  and then removing reads that were less than 25 bp long. this resulted in a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads  being removed, leaving  <dig> , <dig> paired reads and  <dig> , <dig> single reads. mean read length after trimming was 38 bp , and the q20% increased to  <dig> %. although this quality filtering removed a large amount of sequence, removal of low quality bases is likely to result in a more accurate assembly  <cit> .

de novo assembly
the trimmed sequence reads were assembled into  <dig>  transcripts using velvet and oases by merging individual assemblies produced with a range of kmers . oases clusters transcript isoforms into putative loci  <cit> . however, because we aimed to produce a non-redundant set of mrna sequences for tuatara rather than study alternative splicing, we used a python script to choose the longest and/or highest coverage transcript for each locus prior to merging individual kmer assemblies. duplicates were then removed with cd-hit-est  <cit> . thus, when we refer to transcripts in this study, we are referring to the representative transcripts chosen for each locus. table  <dig> gives summary statistics for each kmer assembly before and after representative transcripts were chosen, and for the final merged set of transcripts.

for each kmer, data from both the initial velvet/oases assembly , and the assembly containing only one representative transcript from each locus  are shown. the “merged” assembly is the result of merging representative assemblies from different kmers using cd-hit-est, the “final” assembly is after potentially misassembled transcripts were removed, and the “annotated” set only contains transcripts with a significant blast match. kmer = required length of overlap match between two reads in velvet; n <dig> = length-weighted median contig length.

assemblies at higher kmers  used fewer reads and had lower mean contig length than assemblies at lower kmers , as after quality trimming many reads were shorter than the kmer length for higher kmers, so fewer reads were used in these assemblies. however, assemblies using higher kmers contained transcripts not captured at lower kmers, so the final merged assembly had a greater diversity of transcripts overall. the lower n <dig> and mean contig length of the merged assembly compared with the  <dig> and  <dig> kmer assemblies is due to the addition of shorter sequences from the higher kmer assemblies.

assembly validation and annotation
assessing whether transcripts have actually assembled correctly is problematic in the absence of a reference genome, so we employed an internal validation method of mapping quality-trimmed reads back to the assembly in order to identify poor quality and potentially misassembled transcripts. a total of  <dig>  transcripts that either had a mean coverage per base of less than  <dig>  or contained coverage gaps, were removed from the assembly. we also removed  <dig> transcripts that were identified by repeatmasker as containing ribosomal rna sequences. the final dataset, which was used for all subsequent analyses, now contained  <dig>  transcripts, with an n <dig> of 675 bp and a mean transcript length of 451 bp . a fasta file of these transcripts is available as additional file  <dig>  transcripts range from 100 bp to  <dig>  bp in length, with  <dig>  transcripts over 1 kb , and a mean coverage per base, from mapping with bwa, of  <dig>  . the mean transcript length in our study was similar to that obtained in transcriptome studies for non-model organisms using  <dig> data .

we further validated our assembly by assessing the sequence completeness and information content of our set of transcripts. the full-lengther software identified  <dig> % of our transcripts as full length , or putative full length . these transcripts were predicted to contain the entire protein coding region but may have incomplete 5` or 3` untranslated regions. this result indicates that many of our transcripts represent only fragments of genes, and further sequencing will be required to increase the number of full-length transcripts.

blast searches were performed to assess the percentage of transcripts that match known genes in other species, and thus are likely to contain valid genes. we used megablast to query the  <dig> known tuatara mrna sequences, and tblastx to compare our transcripts with the green anole lizard, chicken and zebrafinch unigene sets. thirty-four transcripts had significant matches to a total of  <dig> different tuatara mrna sequences. most of the existing tuatara mrna sequences are only partial coding sequences, and in many cases our sequences only overlapped with a portion of this previously isolated sequence. however in the regions of overlap, 73% of transcripts had 95% or greater sequence identity. it is difficult to assess whether sequence differences between our transcripts and existing tuatara sequences represent sequence errors. in many cases the differences likely reflect real genetic variation among individual tuatara, or matches with related, but non-homologous genes.

in total,  <dig>  transcripts had a significant match to green anole, zebrafinch or chicken unigene sequences, with  <dig>  transcripts matching all three. the highest number of matches was to the chicken unigene set, with  <dig> %  of our transcripts matching. the zebrafinch unigene set had the next highest number of matches, with  <dig> %  of our transcripts matching, but only  <dig> %  had matches in the green anole unigene set. of the three unigene sets we used for comparison, the chicken set is most likely to represent a complete transcriptome. this unigene set is constructed from over  <dig> individual cdna libraries and has undergone more than  <dig> builds, compared with the green anole unigene set which is constructed from only  <dig> libraries and has undergone only  <dig> builds. thus, the low number of matches with the green anole unigene set compared with that of chicken is probably due to the fact that the green anole unigene set is less complete than that of chicken.

of the  <dig>  tuatara transcripts which matched the chicken unigene set,  <dig>  matched unique chicken genes suggesting that our transcripts represent nearly  <dig>  individual genes. the assembly method we used where assemblies produced from multiple k-mers are merged, may result in the proliferation of duplicate contigs. although using cd-hit-est should have removed the majority of these duplicates, there is still a possibility that our dataset contains some redundancy. the blast results against the chicken unigene dataset indicates that we do have instances where multiple transcripts match a single chicken gene, but in most cases these represent transcripts mapping to different parts of the same gene, or paralogous tuatara sequences having the same chicken gene as the best match. few appear to be the result of duplicates introduced by the assembly process. as the entire chicken unigene set  contains  <dig>  sequences our dataset covers about 22%  of the transcriptome. this should be regarded as a minimum estimate, as the large evolutionary distance between tuatara and chicken  means that many tuatara orthologues of chicken genes would be too diverged to align.

we further annotated our sequences by searching the ncbi non-redundant  protein database using blastx. we found that  <dig>  sequences  had matches with an e-value of less than 1e- <dig>  the species with the highest number of top blast hits was the green anole lizard , followed by chicken , zebrafinch  and turkey .

we compiled a dataset of “annotated” sequences from those that had a significant match  to either the ncbi non-redundant  protein database, the chicken, zebrafinch or green anole unigene sets, or to previously known tuatara transcripts. this dataset contained  <dig>  sequences, with an n <dig> of  <dig>  mean length of 586 bp, and mean coverage per base of  <dig>  . of these sequences,  <dig>  were full-length . the longer mean length and n <dig>  and higher mean coverage of this dataset shows that sequences with a blast match were longer and likely to be of higher quality than those which did not match any known sequences. the un-annotated sequences may still be valid genes, but may have undergone a large amount of sequence divergence or be short fragments of genes. additional file  <dig> shows the top blast hits to each database for each transcript.

the percentage of sequences that match known genes in our study  compares favourably with other studies on non-model organisms, despite the fact that the tuatara is the most evolutionarily distinct vertebrate for which a transcriptome has been sequenced, sharing a most recent common ancestor with its closest relatives  about  <dig> million years ago. other de novo transcriptome assembly studies on non-model organisms have reported blast matches for 20-46% of sequences, with e value thresholds ranging from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig> <cit> . among other reptile transcriptome studies,  <dig> % of burmese python, and 34% of garter snake transcripts could be annotated using blastx to chicken, green anole lizard and ncbi-nr databases  <cit> ; and a study of brain transcriptomes from the nile crocodile, corn snake, bearded dragon and red-eared turtle was able to match 36-46% of transcripts from these species to known sequences in ensembl and unigene databases  <cit> .

we were able to annotate  <dig>  of our transcripts with gene ontogeny  ids using blast2go. of these,  <dig>  were annotated with a biological process,  <dig>  with a molecular function, and  <dig>  with a cellular component. a breakdown of the go annotations within each category is shown in figure  <dig>  as would be expected in a developing embryo, a large number of transcripts with molecular functions of binding  and transcriptional regulation  were identified. our dataset also includes many sequences with biological process annotations that may be relevant to studies of sex determination and adaptation in tuatara, including metabolism , development , reproduction  and growth .

candidate genes and repeat content
a keyword search of our blast results to the ncbi nr and unigene databases showed that our dataset contained several candidate genes which may be useful for studies of tuatara local adaptation and sex determination . we identified partial sequences for several genes associated with immune function, including major histocompatibility complex  genes and a toll-like receptor gene.

a search for genes known to be involved in sex determination and differentiation found sox <dig>  sox <dig>  and dax <dig>  but no sign of dmrt <dig>  wt <dig>  sf <dig>  aromatase, anti-mullerian hormone, wnt <dig>  or foxl <dig>  the initial trigger for temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles is not known, and many of the genes listed above are expressed as the gonads are differentiating into male or female forms  <cit> . the embryo we used in this study was sacrificed during the thermosensitive period, the window of time when temperature determines the sex of the embryo, but before full differentiation of the gonads. by switching the embryo from female to male-producing temperatures for one week during this time we had hoped to encourage expression of both male and female differentiating transcripts. however, the lack of major sex differentiating genes in our dataset suggests that the sex-differentiating pathway was not fully activated when our embryo was sacrificed. it is also possible that switching from female to male-producing temperatures switched off the expression of female-differentiating genes. the presence of sox genes and dax <dig> in our dataset indicates that these may play an early role in sex differentiation in tuatara, but we were not able to determine whether these genes are expressed specifically in developing gonadal tissue.

we also searched for genes known to be upregulated in response to temperature, including cold-inducible rna binding protein  and heat-shock proteins. we found a single transcript matching the full-length cirbp gene. this transcript had high coverage , suggesting it is highly expressed. cirbp is known to be induced by low temperature in other species and acts as a translational repressor  <cit> . in snapping turtles it is differentially expressed in the gonads early in the sex determining period, indicating a potential role in temperature-dependent sex determination  <cit> . we also found more than  <dig> transcripts matching seven different types of heat-shock protein . heat shock proteins have also been implicated in temperature-dependent sex determination, with sexually dimorphic expression of hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> observed in american alligator gonadal tissue  <cit> . in order to further elucidate the role of these and other potential sex determination triggers, future work should focus on transcriptome analysis of genital ridge cells from both male and female embryos, both before, during and after the thermosensitive period.

the tuatara genome is known to contain a large number and diversity of repetitive elements  <cit> , so we used repeatmasker to determine whether these are transcribed into rna. a total of  <dig>  repetitive elements and  <dig>  regions of low complexity were identified in our dataset, comprising  <dig> % of the overall sequence . retroelements made up  <dig> % of the sequence , including  <dig> long interspersed repeats ,  <dig> short interspersed repeats  and  <dig> long terminal repeat  elements. the most commonly found retroelement was the chicken repeat  <dig> , but 26 l <dig> and 119 l <dig> elements were also present. cr <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> have previously been identified in the tuatara genome, as have all of the ltr elements identified in this study  <cit> . other repetitive elements found in this study included dna transposons , satellites and simple sequence repeats . repetitive elements account for 30% of the green anole lizard genome  <cit>  and 30-50% of mammalian genomes  <cit> , and are known to modulate the expression of nearby genes, for instance by providing an alternative promoter or by repressing transcription  <cit> . although many repetitive elements are not expressed, transcriptionally active repetitive elements have been identified in other transcriptomes, including those of plants  <cit> , drosophila <cit> , humans  <cit>  and snake venom glands  <cit>  and liver  <cit> . reptile genomes contain a wider variety of repetitive elements than those of birds or mammals, and tuatara appear to have a higher diversity of repeat types than other birds and reptiles studied to date, which is consistent with their low metabolic rate, large genome size and long divergence time from other reptiles  <cit> . the number of transcribed repetitive elements in the tuatara genome may be much higher than what we measured here, as repetitive dna is known to be difficult to assemble, especially from short reads. thus many of the reads that were not used in our assembly might contain repetitive elements.

using msatcommander, we found  <dig> dinucleotide,  <dig> trinucleotide and  <dig> tetranucleotide microsatellites longer than 20 bp, across  <dig> transcripts. eight transcripts contained more than one microsatellite. this shows that our dataset is a rich source of microsatellites which could potentially be useful for studying population genetic structure, demography and the genetic basis of local adaptation in tuatara. previous studies have characterised a total of  <dig> microsatellite markers for tuatara  <cit>  but their location in the genome, and potential linkage with functional genes is unknown. although the microsatellites identified here will require further testing to determine their utility as markers, our dataset has the potential to increase the number of markers available for tuatara by several-fold, and to provide a source of markers linked to known genes which may be useful for assaying functional variation and detecting selection  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a first insight into the tuatara transcriptome, increasing the number of annotated tuatara mrna sequences from  <dig> to almost  <dig> . our results show the utility of using illumina short-read data to assemble a transcriptome for a non-model, evolutionarily distinct organism. even though the read length in our study was short , the depth of coverage was sufficient to assemble more than  <dig>  full-length transcripts and an additional  <dig>  partial transcripts, with a mean transcript length similar to that obtained from transcriptomes produced from  <dig> data and a large number of long transcripts .

although our assembly appears to be of reasonable quality based on transcript metrics such as n <dig>  mean length, and coverage, determining whether transcripts are in fact correctly assembled poses a particular challenge. not only are tuatara  <dig> million years removed from their closest relatives the squamate reptiles  <cit> , but reptiles are poorly represented in genome studies in general. at the time of writing, a full genome sequence is only available for one reptile, the green anole lizard  <cit> , and transcriptome data is only available for a handful of species, the majority of which are squamate reptiles  <cit> . we employed quality filtering both before and after assembly to increase the probability that only correctly assembled sequences were included in our final dataset. although this process removed a lot of sequence from our dataset, we were able to match nearly half of the assembled transcripts with known genes, despite the lack of comparative resources, indicating that our dataset contained a high proportion of correctly assembled genes.

as one of the few transcriptomes available for a non-squamate reptile the dataset assembled here will help fill the void of reptile genomic resources and provide key information for studies of amniote evolution. with other reptile genome projects planned or currently in progress  <cit> , including one for tuatara , a new age of reptile genomics is underway  <cit> . as one of the earliest-diverging reptile lineages, and the sole representative of one of the four reptilian orders, genomic data for tuatara will be essential for understanding the structure of the ancestral amniote genome and the evolution of key biological systems, such as those involved in sex differentiation, immunity, cold adaptation and metabolism. the tuatara transcriptome assembled in this study can be used as a reference for future studies of gene expression in tuatara and for annotation of the tuatara genome; and contains candidate genes and genetic markers that will be a useful resource for future studies of tuatara biology and ecology.
