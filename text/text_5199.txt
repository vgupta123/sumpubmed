BACKGROUND
for a long time, the identification of gene functions has been based on classical forward genetic screens where mutants are randomly generated, e.g. by chemical or transposon mediated mutagenesis. the established mutant strains are then screened for phenotypes and subsequently the disrupted gene is identified and further analyzed  <cit> . importantly, it has been observed that the phenotypes of drosophila and mouse mutants can depend on the genetic background of different strains, e.g.  <cit> . the same has been found for e.coli, rice and c.elegans  <cit> . in yeast, the portion of genes that are essential in only one of two closely related strains has been estimated to be about 6%  <cit> . the unbiased forward genetic approach to identify gene functions has been very successful but it also limits the questions that can be addressed. first, saturating screens are only feasible in a very small number of model organisms  <cit> . within insects, this is true only for the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster while a few non-saturating screens have been performed in other insects including the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum  <cit> . the limitation to highly developed model organisms at the same time limits the scope of biological questions that can be asked. a further restriction of forward genetics is that mutant strains need to be maintained over time, which represents a significant effort feasible only with the support of large scientific communities. moreover, the genetic tools, which facilitate stock keeping  are not available in most organisms and are tedious to construct.

the discovery of rna interference  in animals  <cit>  has opened the possibility to study gene function in many more animals and has significantly contributed to a an expansion of biological questions that are studied in terms of gene function. in rnai, double stranded rna  within cells is processed by the highly conserved rnai machinery including the dicer protein, which cuts the long dsrna into 21mers. these are loaded into the destruction complex , which is guided by the single stranded small interfering rnas  to mrnas with complementary sequence. the argonaute protein as part of the risc complex eventually cuts the mrnas within the region of complementary, leading to the destruction of the mrna and consequently to a reduction of the gene product  <cit> . rnai is an anti-viral defense system, is required for the silencing of transposons  <cit>  and highly related processes act in post-transcriptional gene regulation, the control of chromatin and rna polymerase ii transcription elongation activity  <cit> .

the rnai response of some organisms is systemic, i.e. dsrna delivered into the body cavity is distributed throughout the organism and enters all cells. hence, local injection leads to systemic gene silencing  <cit> . in some organisms like c. elegans and tribolium the rnai effect is transmitted even from injected parents to the offspring  <cit> .

rnai in the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum is robust, systemic, splice variant specific and feasible at all developmental stages  <cit> . moreover, it is able to phenocopy genetic null alleles at least in some instances, e.g. in the case of tcdfd  <cit> , tcdistalless  <cit> tckrüppel  <cit>  and tcknirps . the strength of the rnai response can be experimentally modulated by varying the concentration of injected dsrna or by varying the time between injection of the mother and collection of the phenotypic offspring  <cit> .

in an ongoing genome wide rnai screen in tribolium , females of the black strain  <cit>  were injected with dsrna of the fragment ib_ <dig> and were subsequently mated to pig <dig> males  <cit> . in the cuticle of offspring first instar larvae, specific labrum defects were observed with high frequency. the knocked-down gene product is an importin α, which belongs to the karyopherin multi-gene family of nuclear import receptors  <cit> . in metazoans three classes of importin α genes exist: importin α <dig>  importin α <dig>  and importin α <dig>  <cit> . importin α proteins are nuclear import adaptors, which bind cargos containing a classical nuclear localization signal  sequence  <cit> . the importin α-cargo heterodimer forms a trimeric complex with the actual importer importin β, which enables the passage of the cargo through the nuclear pore complex  <cit> . the importin α <dig> protein shows a tandem array of ten armadillo  repeats, where the arm domains  <dig> to  <dig>  and the domains  <dig> to  <dig>  are responsible for recognition and binding of specific cargoes  <cit> . all members of the importin α family function the same way and it has been shown that they act redundantly on many cargoes but there are also cargoes, which require a specific importin α for their nuclear import  <cit> . in the yeast s. cerevisiae, estimated 57% of steady-state nuclear proteins use this import system  <cit> . considering this, it was surprising that the knock-down of a gene which encodes such a widely required factor would lead to such a specific cuticle phenotype in tribolium.

in this work, we quantitatively compare the rnai phenotypes of tc-importin α <dig> in two tribolium laboratory strains, black and san bernadino . surprisingly, we find that rnai knock-down leads to qualitatively different phenotypes depending on the strain. further, we show that this is neither due to a general difference in rnai sensitivity of these strains nor to nucleotide sequence divergence between them or differential embryonic expression. instead, we find that the genotype of the injected female determines the rnai phenotype of the offspring. these results show that the phenotypes generated in rnai experiments can depend on the genotype of the used strain and we suggest that a proper documentation of the strain is an essential piece of information when publishing rnai studies in any species.

RESULTS
ib_ <dig> dsrna targets tc-importin α1
the rnai phenotype of the ib_ <dig> dsrna fragment revealed by the ibeetle screen was marked by a highly penetrant and specific loss of the labrum . in order to follow up this phenotype, we first analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of the targeted gene. the ib_ <dig> sequence is part of the coding sequence of tc <dig> . phylogenetic analysis revealed that the tc <dig> gene is the single importin α <dig> ortholog of tribolium, called tc-importin α <dig> in the following . the tc-importin α <dig> protein is more similar to the mouse orthologs  than to drosophila importin α <dig>  we checked the expression of tc-importin α <dig> by in situ hybridization and found it to be expressed ubiquitously in both sb and black embryos .

tc-importin α <dig> prnai cuticle phenotype is different in the two strains
to test whether the labrum specific ib_ <dig> phenotype detected under the high throughput conditions of the ibeetle screen was reproducible and not due to off target effects, two non-overlapping dsrna fragments of the tc-importin α <dig> open reading frame were generated  and injected into female pupae of the sb strain with the same dsrna concentration as in the screen . the resulting cuticles were scored for deletion or malformation of different parts of the body . in addition, the number of individuals falling into one of several specific phenotype classes was determined . note that the “labrum only” class represents cuticles that show defects in the labrum but not in other structures. some phenotypes did not fit any of the classes shown and were not similar enough to group them into an own class. knock-down using the first fragment  resulted in a much stronger cuticle phenotype than observed in the screen. most frequent were abdominal malformations , ranging from mild phenotypes in which the abdomen was constricted  to cuticles which showed an inversion of abdominal segments into the interior of the cuticle . defects in the thoracic segments were frequent  where in most cases only single thoracic segments or legs were deformed . malformation of the head included mainly the loss  or deformation  of gnathal appendages . the antennae  and labrum  were also often affected after tc-importin α <dig> rnai. in some cases, the complete head and adjacent thoracic segments were absent . dorsal cuticle defects  were found in  <dig> % of examined larvae. unexpectedly, the labrum-only defects observed in the ibeetle screen  were not observed in this experiment while overall, the defects were much more extensive. of note, in all cases where the labrum was recorded as not being present  this was due to complete loss of the head in the respective cuticle . the results of the non-overlapping fragment  displayed quantitatively and qualitatively similar defects with somewhat reduced strength of labral and gnathal defects and the headless phenotype . this made off target effects unlikely. in order to independently check the different quality of the phenotypes, we conducted a correspondence analysis of the data and visualized the results in a xy-plot. the phenotypes in the different strains form distinct clusters confirming the different quality of the phenotypes .

in order to test whether this unexpected phenotypic difference was due to the selection of dsrna fragments different from the one used in the screen , or alternatively, from the use of a different strain, tc-importin α <dig> rnai was repeated in the black strain. both non-overlapping dsrna fragments  were injected into black female pupae, which were mated with black males  or pig <dig> males . the knock-down using the tc-importin α1a dsrna  frequently resulted in cuticles with an affected labrum  which was either deformed  or completely absent . in a portion of the cuticles, other head defects  or abdominal defects were found . notably, the “labrum only” phenotype was frequent . these observations were confirmed using the non-overlapping fragment with the only difference that additional dorsal cuticle defects were observed . to further confirm our finding, we repeated the rnai with the original ib_ <dig> dsrna fragment  in the black and sb strains, which resulted essentially in the same strain specific phenotypes .

taken together, these results showed that the knock-down of tcimportin α <dig> led to different phenotypes depending on which strain was injected and that this difference was not due to off target effects. because both non-overlapping dsrna fragments resulted in similar phenotypes, the following experiments were done using the tc-importin α1a fragment. importin α proteins are essential parts of the nuclear import machinery and have housekeeping functions  <cit> . therefore, one would expect a dramatic and pleiotropic loss of function phenotype. the phenotype in the sb strain matches this expectation pretty well. also in the black strain, some pleiotropic defects are observed, which increase somewhat in number at higher dsrna concentrations. this is an indication that the expected pleiotropic phenotype is present but strongly reduced in the black strain.

the phenotypes are qualitatively different
rnai experiments tend to produce a phenotypic series depending on the amount of injected dsrna and due to experimental variation. hence, despite the fact that the same concentration of dsrna was injected in all experiments, the “labrum only” phenotype found in black could represent a weak phenotype while the more widespread defects found in sb could represent the stronger part of the phenotypic series. on the one hand, the additional defects that occurred in the black strain-albeit at low frequencies-could be interpreted in this way. on the other hand, the fact that the “labrum only” phenotype occurred very frequently in the black strain  but never in the sb strain  indicated a qualitative difference. if these different phenotypes were part of one phenotypic series, the injection of different amounts of dsrnas in both strains was predicted to reveal concentrations where the phenotype pattern in both strains would overlap. therefore, we injected both lower and higher concentrations of dsrna into both strains .

injecting lower amounts of dsrna  into the sb strain led to a decreased frequency of cuticular defects, while their quality was similar to the  <dig> μg/μl experiment . specifically, the “labrum only” phenotype was not found. using  <dig> μg/μl dsrna led to an “empty egg” phenotype in all animals. empty egg phenotypes are an indicator of very severe embryonic defects leading to the abortion of embryonic development prior to cuticle secretion resulting in empty egg shells in cuticle preparations .

knock-down of tc-importin α <dig> in the black strain using  <dig>  μg/μl dsrna resulted in a very similar phenotypic pattern as shown for  <dig> μg/μl . notably, “labrum only” phenotypes were found in about 80%  where the labrum was absent in  <dig> %. other defects were observed with low frequency. injection of  <dig> μg/μl dsrna led to cuticles with a comparable occurrence of labrum defects but with a slightly increased portion of other cuticular defects . as consequence, the number of “labrum only”  phenotypes dropped to 30% but the labrum remained the most frequently deleted structure . finally, we tested the effect of tc-importin α1rnai in two other strains. we injected females of the pig <dig> strain  and mated them with black males. the phenotype of the offspring was intermediate between black and sb injected females . in the georgia- <dig>  genetic background, the injected females became sterile not allowing judging the cuticle phenotype of the offspring .

in summary, the phenotypic series generated by rnai with the same dsrna in different strains differed qualitatively in several respects: “labrum only” phenotypes were found exclusively in the black strain while the abdomen inside-out phenotype always remained below 5%. moreover, increasing dsrna concentrations led to a rather mild increase of phenotypic severity but even at highest concentrations the “empty egg” phenotype was not increased beyond background. in the sb strain, in contrast, “labrum only” phenotypes were not found at all, while the abdomen inside out class was always high. increasing amounts of dsrna led to a significant increase of phenotypic severity leading to 100%“empty egg” phenotypes at high concentrations. at the same time, the phenotypes also show similarities: the pleiotropic defects seen in sb and to a minor extent also in black represent the expected pleiotropic phenotype of a nuclear import protein.

rnai sensitivity is similar in the black and sb strains
the different rnai phenotypes could be due to a different strength of the rnai response in these strains or alternatively could be due to the different genetic background, which interacted differently with tc-importin α <dig> but not other genes. to test this, we first quantified the transcript level in the rnai animals by qpcr. the expression was reduced by >93% in both strains in both 0-2h, 10-12h egg collections as well as in ovaries . as a complementary means to compare rnai efficiency in the strains, we quantitatively compared the phenotypic range induced in the sb and black strains after rnai using the same dsrna preparations targeting four different genes.

first, we checked tcdistalless  and tcgiant , which elicit well quantifiable defects in the offspring of injected pupae  <cit> . dsrna targeting tcdll was injected into both strains,  <dig> cuticles of the first egg collection  were analyzed regarding the number and state of the remaining leg segments. the cuticles were grouped into four different classes of phenotypic strength. in the strongest class only a coxa remained present  while in the weakest class an almost complete trochanter was present . the strongest phenotype was found only in black tcdll rnai , but also the mildest phenotype was observed more often in the black strain. we arbitrarily rated the four categories  and calculated the average phenotype strength, which turned out to be similar .

the analogous experiment was performed with tc-gt dsrna . the number of deleted trunk segments was used as measure for the phenotypic strength. this number varied from zero to six deleted trunk segments . overall, the distribution in both strains was similar, while both the strongest and the mildest phenotypes were only observed in sb cuticles . also the average of the number of deleted segments was very similar .

further, we performed larval rnai for tc-wingless  and tc-six <dig> in order to compare the rnai response after larval rnai . knock-down of tc-wg via injection of dsrna  into late larval stages  of sb and black lead to pupae with reduced genital lobes, an increased distance between the pupal wings and a reduced maxillary diameter . the latter was the best quantifiable indicator because the diameter is very constant in wt pupae . the phenotypic series was divided into four categories , was rated and the average was calculated. both strains show a comparable mean value .

tc-six <dig> dsrnai injection  in l <dig> larvae led to pupae with reduced eye size , which was quantified . again, the phenotypes were grouped into four categories and the mean values were calculated . tc-six <dig> lrnai resulted in slightly stronger pupal phenotypes in the sb strain .

taking into account the experimental variability inherent to rnai experiments, these data suggest that our strains do not have a generally different rnai response. moreover, the nucleic acid sequence of the dsrna fragments is almost identical in both strains , making different rnai efficiencies due to mismatches unlikely. hence, the strain specific phenotypic difference we observed was likely due to different modulation of the tc-importin α <dig> phenotype in the respective genetic backgrounds. this is similar to findings in other model organisms, where the phenotype of mutant alleles of some  genes is different depending on the genetic background of the strain.

tc-importin α <dig> peptide sequence is slightly diverged
next, we asked whether differences of the amino acid composition of tc-importin α <dig> protein could be the reason for the differences. we isolated and sequenced the coding sequences of both strains. the tc-importin α <dig> amino acid sequences  of the black and sb strains were aligned with the sequenced strain  and with importin α orthologs of other species.

the black and the ga- <dig> strains have identical sequences whereas the sb strain has different amino acids at two sites  within the cargo binding arm domains. the first site  is located within the second arm domain, where the black and the ga- <dig> strains show a serine  whereas the sb strain shows an asparagine . in metazoa, this position is either occupied by a threonine  , serine  or asparagine  . all three amino acids are similar regarding their polar but uncharged side chains.

the second different amino acid is located within the eighth arm domain . here, the sb strain encodes a leucine , whereas the two other tribolium strains show a glutamine , which is also found in the two hymenopterans nasonia vitripennis  and apis mellifera . m. musculus carries an alanine  at this position, which is hydrophobic and not polar, whereas d. melanogaster has a glutamic acid, which is acidic and negatively charged. none of the two sites is predicted to be the target of phosphorylation, n-glycosalation nor n-myristoylation by expasy and prosite analysis. taken together, the observed amino acid substitutions may lead to altered binding affinities, which might influence the phenotype. however, this is difficult to test because we do not know which of the many nuclear proteins likely to be imported by importin αs actually elicit the observed phenotypes. an alternative explanation would be that the mutations lead to differential splicing of the gene in the different strains.

the maternal genotype mainly determines the tc-importin α <dig> phenotype
our data hinted at the genetic background as cause for the different phenotypes. however, it remained open whether this would be based on zygotic gene expression  or whether different maternal inputs would be involved . in order to distinguish between these possibilities, tc-importin α <dig> dsrna  was injected in sb and black females and these were afterwards mated with males of the other strain, respectively. therefore, zygotic expression of genes was based on heterozygous condition for black/sb in all offspring while the maternal contribution was either of the black or the sb type.

offspring of injected sb females mated with black males showed a similar phenotype as described for the sb strain . in  <dig> analyzed cuticles the “abdomen inside-out” phenotype was most prominent . besides, the “small abdomen”  and the “headless”  phenotype could also be observed in some cuticles. the “labrum only” phenotype was very rare . when tc-importin α <dig> was knocked-down in black female pupae which were crossed to sb males, the phenotypes were similar to the phenotype of the black strain . the labrum defects were most frequent , and in 50% the only affected structure. also, the sb typical “abdomen inside-out” phenotype was not observed.

these results show that it is primarily the genotype of the mother, which determines the quality of the tc-importin α <dig> rnai phenotype while the minor increase of “labrum only” phenotypes to  <dig> % indicate some influence of the zygotic genome, too.

the importance of maternal contribution of importin α proteins is plausible, because it is known from drosophila that the transition from maternal to zygotic control occurs only at cell cycle 13– <dig>  <cit> . already before this transition the nuclear import machinery is essential to allow gene activity. this is ensured by a strong maternal contribution  <cit> .

relative maternal contribution of tc-importin α <dig> is reduced in the black strain
based on the fact that importin α proteins act redundantly in the import of most proteins  <cit>  we asked whether the maternal supply of the oocyte with importin mrnas would be different in the sb and black strains. specifically, we wanted to test the model that the contribution of maternal tcimportin α <dig> was relatively small in the black strain and that this was buffered by increased tcimportin α2/ <dig> contributions. in that case, knock-down of tcimportin α <dig> would lead to less prominent phenotypes in the black strain because most defects would be buffered by the other importins α’s.

by quantitative rt-pcr, we determined the amount of mrna present in ovaries where maternal load of oocytes takes place, freshly laid eggs which reflect the final maternal load and embryos at 10– <dig> hours of development, where zygotic transcription has started. the qpcr data were normalized to the expression of the ribosomal protein tcrps <dig> within the samples  <cit>  . for better comparability between the strains, we subsequently standardized the datasets such that the tcimportin α <dig> levels are identical in both strains . this allowed detecting relative increase or decrease of the other importin αs. both tcimportin α <dig> and  <dig> levels were higher in all samples in the black strain compared to the sb strain but none of these differences was significant.

maternal increase of tc-importin α <dig> in tc-importin α <dig> rnai embryos in the black strain
an alternative possibility for different maternal buffering of the tc-importin α paralogs was that the knock-down of tc-importin α <dig> would be compensated by different patterns of upregulation of the other tc-importin α paralogs in these strains. indeed, in 0-2h old embryos of tc-importin α <dig> rnai animals, the load of tc-importin α <dig> was significantly increased in the black but not the sb strain . at this embryonic stage, maternal messages predominate, hence, it appears that maternal upregulation was involved in rescuing parts of the phenotype in the black strain. interestingly, the situation was different when measuring zygotic transcript levels in 10-12h embryos. here, the black transcript levels are not altered much, while in sb, tc-importin α <dig> and  <dig> are upregulated. apparently, the delayed compensation in sb is too late to rescue the embryonic phenotype.

potential mechanisms leading to the phenotypic differences
this work was primarily aimed at showing that the quality of rnai phenotypes may depend on the genetic background of the strain used. however, we also gained some insights into the potential mechanism how the difference might arise in the specific case of tcimportin α <dig>  two things need to be explained: first, the absence of the expected pleiotropic defect, and second the occurrence of the qualitatively different “labrum only” phenotype in the black strain. to explain the apparent decrease of pleiotropic defects, we suggest that females of the black strain load their oocytes with more tcimportin α <dig> and  <dig> relative to tcimportin α <dig> and moreover, compensate for loss of tcimportin α <dig> by upregulating tcimportin α <dig>  therefore, the importin paralogs are able to rescue the knock-down effect of tcimportin α <dig> much better in the black than in the sb strain. this would lead to a comparably mild pleiotropic phenotype. indeed, functional redundancies  <cit>  and the resulting masking of phenotypes  <cit>  by the different importin α’s was described previously in drosophila.

the black specific “labrum only” phenotype might depend on the strain specific amino acid changes found within the cargo binding domains. this difference may have allowed one or several target proteins required for labrum development to evolve an importin α <dig> specific import signal. loss of tc-importin α <dig> would be compensated by the paralogs for most proteins but not for the labrum specific protein, leading to the observed labrum specific phenotype. this model is in line with data showing that importin paralogs besides their redundant roles in nuclear import of many proteins do also have paralog-specific cargoes  <cit> . a prerequisite for testing this model is the identification of all genes that lead to “no labrum” phenotypes. then, these could be tested for differential binding with the different importin αs.

alternatively, a higher relative expression of tc-importin α <dig> in the labrum anlagen of the black strain could contribute to a “labrum only” phenotype. however, we were not able to detect differences in labral expression of tc-importin α <dig> in the black and sb strains by in situ hybridization. we might have missed mild modulations of expression–whether such minor differences would be able to lead to such a clear phenotype remains questionable. however, with the current data, we cannot exclude that the mechanism is much more complex and may involve many additional factors and interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
documentation of strains is essential for future rnai studies
it has been known from mice and drosophila that different genetic backgrounds of laboratory inbred strains can affect the phenotypes in transgenic experiments  was obtained from the ibeetle genome browser . the following primers were used to amplify the open reading frame froman embryonic cdna pool  via standard pcr: 5’-atgtcgggctccgctcacaa-3’ and 5’-ttaaaaatggaatcctcccatcggcaccg -3’. the tc-importin α <dig> open reading frame was cloned into the pjet <dig>  vector.

rnai
the sequences of the fragments used for rnai are given in the additional file <dig> b. the templates for the non-overlapping fragments were generated by pcr from a plasmid template using following primers: 5’-taatacgactcactataggagtctggaggagggttcttgc-3’ and t <dig> primer  for the 5’ fragment  and 5’-taatacgactcactataggttgcgaaagtctccccagct-3’ and pjet <dig> r sequencing primer with a t7-attachment  for the 3’ fragment . concentrations for parental rnai were  <dig>  μg/μl,  <dig> μg/μl and  <dig> μg/μl ,  <dig> μg/μl  and for larval rnai  <dig> μg/μl  and  <dig>  μg/μl . pupal injections were performed as described  <cit> . for larval rnai  the larvae were anaesthetized by cooling them on ice. the dsrna was injected using the femtojet express . late larval stages  were injected into the ventro-lateral side between the fifth and sixth abdominal segment. on average  <dig> - <dig>  μl dsrna were injected into one larva. injected larvae were raised as described  <cit> .

microscopy and image analysis
cuticles were documented using a zeiss lsm  <dig> as described  <cit> . tcdll rnai legs were recorded in  <dig> focal planes using a zeiss axioplan microscope and image-pro plus software . deconvolution was performed with the “no neighbour” method followed by a maximum projection using imagej . pupae were analyzed and documented using a leica m <dig> fa fluorescence stereomicroscope.

lrnai pupae were analyzed using imagej . the diameter of the second segment of the maxillary palpus  was measured using the straight line tool. division in phenotypic levels: level 1= wild-type  range of diameter, level 2= minimum wt diameter minus wt range, level 3= minimum level  <dig> diameter minus wt range, level 4= minimum level  <dig> diameter minus wt range. the eye field area of both eyes in tc-six <dig> lrnai in late pupal stages  was measured by freehand selection tool and the mean was calculated. the mean value provided the basis for the phenotype comparison. the phenotype level was chosen arbitrarily.

phylogenetic analysis
importins of the different species were obtained using amino acid sequence of tc-importin α <dig> as query for a blastp search  <cit>  at ncbi . phylogenetic analysis was conducted using mega version  <dig>  <cit> . the multiple alignment was done using the clustalw application with the preset parameters. a phylogenetic tree was calculated using the neighbor-joining method under the poisson amino acid substitution model. bootstrap analysis was conducted using  <dig> replicates to test the robustness of the phylogenetic tree. calculation of a phylogenetic tree using the maximum-likelihood method under the jones-taylor-thornton model amino acid substitution model results in essentially the same phylogenetic tree.

correspondence analysis
for correspondence analysis  <cit> , the labrum, head bristle pattern, antennae, gnathal appendages, thoracal segments, abdominal segments, pygopods and urogomphi of each l <dig> cuticle were classified into three different categories: not affected= <dig>  deformed= <dig>  and absent= <dig>  the dataset was imported into r  and correspondence analysis and plotting was performed by using the r ‘ca’ package  <cit> .

quantitative rt-pcr
total rna was isolated from dissected ovaries of adult beetles using the tissue & insect rna microprep™ kit  and from eggs  using trizol® reagent .  <dig> μg/μl total rna was converted to cdna by using the maxima® first strand cdna synthesis kit for rt-qpcr . quantitative pcr was performed using hot firepol® evagreen® qpcr mix plus   and the cfx96™ real-time pcr system . for the qrt-pcr the following primer pairs were used: tc-importin α1: 5’-ccgtatgctgtgctaatcgag-3’ and 5’-cgtcccgaagaagtgttcaat-3’, tc-importin α2: 5’-aaagtctacgaacgggctttg-3’ and 5’-gaactgaatctccccatttgc-3’, tc-importin α3: 5’-tgaggagtgcaatggcttaga-3’ and 5’-tcatccgcatcaccactaaag-3’ and tc-rps3: 5’-acctcgatacaccatagcaagc-3’ and 5’-accgtcgtattcgtgaattgac-3’. all primers were designed to span an intronic sequence and were validated by gel analysis. to calculate primer efficiency ), a dilution series was performed. data was normalized by the formula: rel. expression=rtarget^cqtarget/rref.^cqref. for better comparison of the results in the two strains, the expression levels were normalized such that the genes with the lowest relative expression were set to the same values in the sb and black strains. specifically, the difference between the means of tc-importin α <dig> expression levels in the sb and the black strains were calculated. subsequently, all sb expression levels were reduced by this mean difference . this normalization was not done for additional file  <dig> k. for statistical analysis, three tests were performed: welch’s t-test, student’s t-test and the mann–whitney-u-test. none of these tests revealed significant differences between the respective expression profiles in sb and black.
