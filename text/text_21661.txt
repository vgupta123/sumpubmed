BACKGROUND
animals living in groups have to synchronise their activities and coordinate their movements in order to remain cohesive  <cit> . group members therefore have to reach consensus about the time and the direction to move collectively  <cit> . however, animals in heterogeneous groups differ in their nutrient requirements, in the information they have about the environment or in their ability to monopolise resources. these differences lead to conflicts of interest between group members, which could result in different strategies emerging about the best way to collectively decide where and when to move  <cit> . these strategies could be summarised and observed via three different explorations: 1) who leads the groups and at what frequency, 2) how individuals are organized during a group movement and 3) what form of communication, if any, is used at the start of group movements, or during them.

the term "leadership" commonly refers to individuals initiating movements or to individuals who change the direction of movement and are followed by the rest of the group  <cit> . even if more and more studies show that this leadership is distributed among all group members, some individuals are seen to initiate movements more often, or are more often located at the front of the progression than their conspecifics  <cit> . several theories have been proposed to explain this emergence of leadership, and they can be separated into two models: the conflict model and the integrative  model  <cit> . in the first model, the leader forces its conspecifics to follow him. in the second model, the emergence of a leader within the group "may in some cases be preferred over egalitarian arrangements  as a solution to the key challenges of life in social groups, such as conflicts over resources, coordination failures and free-riding in cooperative relationships" according to hooper and collaborators  <cit> . in this last model, the leader does not impose a decision on its conspecifics: the latter "decide to let one individual decide". several individuals or social factors influence the leadership  <cit> . old individuals are presumed to have a better knowledge of the environment and may therefore lead the group to rare food resources. many instances have been described in which aged individuals led the group more often than other group members . the most striking example however is most probably the matriarch in elephants  <cit> . dominance is also a factor affecting leadership. in the mountain gorilla , the silverback walks quickly in the direction of the future movement and the other group members follow him  <cit> . there is however an increase in frequency of grunts emitted by females before the initiation of the silverback  <cit> . similar initiations by dominants have also been described in wolves  and in mongooses . however, high-ranking individuals are often those with the highest body mass, and thus the highest nutrient requirements. the different needs of individuals also have an impact on initiation frequency. lactating or pregnant females decide more often than the other group members in baboons  <cit>  or in zebras . a study on the emergence of leadership based on nutrient requirements showed that the individual having the highest needs becomes the leader in about 80% of collective movements. this decision-making system is viable: all individuals are satisfied and can also meet their energetic needs throughout the day, even if they rarely make the decision for the group to move  <cit> . for instance, the body mass of adult chacma baboon males is around  <dig> kg whilst females weigh between  <dig> and  <dig> kg  <cit> . however, lactating females need about 200% more protein and water than non-lactating females  <cit> .

following is possibly as important as leading  <cit> . certain advantages could be gained from the rank held by individuals within the progression . for instance, dominant males or lactating females are at the front of the progression, where they have better access to food resources and can decide which direction to take . on the other hand, juveniles or some females could also be in the central part of the progression simply because these ranks offer the best protection against predators  <cit> . some authors suggest that this type of order within the progression of primates should be attributed to their high cognitive abilities  <cit> : " in a species as intelligent as the baboon, almost any form of social behaviour, spatial or otherwise, could understandably exhibit considerable variation arising from the baboon's ability to adapt features of his world"  <cit> . however, recent research in primates shows that the complex patterns we observed during collective movements can be explained by self-organised processes that have also been described in species such as insects and ungulates  <cit> . there is no real necessity for each group member to know its conspecifics individually or to have a global view of the collective phenomenon  <cit> : an estimation of the number of individuals already moving and/or the number of individuals still resting is sufficient to produce complex collective phenomena. these "rules of thumb" are based on physiological needs and social relationships  <cit> , and they have explained departure latencies, order and associations of individuals during movements in macaques  <cit>  and lemurs  <cit> . whilst former studies tend to prove that the whole group decides to move only through the initiator's act , an increasing number of recent studies now show that following behaviour depends on mimetism  and that the initiator is not the only decision-maker for a group movement  <cit> .

collective decision-making cannot be achieved if group members do not exchange information about their state or their motivations. this communication does not need to be complex and can simply rely on local interactions  <cit> . the most basic signal is walking in a specific direction, showing that the individual is now motivated to go in that particular direction  <cit> . even if vocalisations are used, studies on macaques  <cit>  and chacma baboons  <cit>  showed that this simple visual signal is enough to initiate a movement and to make all group members join it. the same conclusion is reached in the case of non primate species such as geese , cattle  and sheep . authors have however observed that acoustic signals, such as a 'coo' vocalization in japanese macaques  and 'trill' in the white-faced capuchin monkey  are also given before the departure of groups. the acoustic signal is maybe more advantageous in primates than a visual signal, as it has the advantage of propagating the information over a longer distance without being affected by physical barriers  <cit> . authors reported that in baboons, vocalisations such as grunts or loud calls  may play a role in the cohesion of group members  <cit> . although all individuals emit grunts, loud calls are only emitted by males and depend on the dominance rank with high-ranking individuals showing a greater probability to emit grunts  <cit> . however, these signals are not displayed or do not have influence on collective movements in some groups of baboons  <cit> .

in this study, i attempt to identify collective decision-making mechanisms in two groups of free-ranging chacma baboons, namely one small group of  <dig> individuals and one large group of about  <dig> individuals. first, the emergence of leadership, organization of individuals and communication had never been studied at the same time on a same group. secondly, no previous study has assessed how group size might affect these three variables during group movements. i assess in turn the distribution of leadership in both groups, the organization of group members after departure, and communication used by individuals to reach a consensus. i expect adult males to be the main leaders of the group, mainly because of their higher nutrient requirements or their dominance rank  <cit> . for progression order, adult males and sub-adults should rather be located at the front and the back of the progression  whilst adult females and juveniles should be found more in the middle of the progression  for a better protection against predators. if there is a possibility of vocalizations improving coordination between members, i suggest that vocalizations, and particularly loud calls, should be particularly emitted before the initiation of a movement and in the large group. the results of the two groups will be compared in order to assess whether or not the mechanisms underlying decision-making differ according to group size.

methods
study site and subjects
data on chacma baboons were scored at the wildcliff nature reserve, western cape, south africa  from may to july  <dig> for the large group and from may to july  <dig> for the small group. the reserve is a mountain wilderness reserve consisting of deep ravines with afro-mountain forest, rocky mountain tops and high fynbos meadows. an invasive plant, the black wattle, and a grassy meadow can also be found on the reserve. direct or indirect cues showed that leopards and other small carnivores were present in the reserve. three groups of chacma baboons populate this reserve and its surroundings: a large group, a small group and a third group entirely composed of males. at the time of the study, the large group consisted of between  <dig> and  <dig> individuals ,  <dig> % were adult females with babies,  <dig> % were sub-adults  and  <dig> % were juveniles ). the small group consisted of  <dig> individuals: one adult male, five adult females , two sub-adults and four juveniles. the compositions of these two groups are therefore comparable. the two groups were already habituated to the presence of human beings. group members could not be identified individually, only classes of sex and age were identifiable . a previous study showed that movement of these baboons throughout the day are relative to foraging and finding resources  <cit> .

definitions
an 'initiation' was defined as the movement of an individual in one direction over a distance of at least  <dig> m beyond the periphery of the group, when no other initiation had been made in the same direction within the  <dig> previous minutes . an individual performing this behaviour is called the 'initiator'. all departing movements in the same direction as the initiator within the  <dig> minutes following the initiation were considered to be following movement, and the individuals performing these behaviours for distances of  <dig> meters or more were defined as followers . if no group members followed the initiator within  <dig> minutes, the phenomenon was defined as a 'failed initiation'. i scored the number of followers for each initiation and analysed it. i did not define a threshold to qualify an initiation as 'successful'. indeed, it is difficult to predict exactly how many followers are necessary to make an initiation successful for an initiator, even if previous research has revealed a threshold of three followers in capuchins  <cit>  and macaques  <cit>  when an initiator stops to emit recruitment signals. in baboons, stueckle and zinner  <cit>  set the threshold at five following individuals to qualify an initiation as successful.

the order of progression during departure  was calculated. the initiator was ranked  <dig>  the first follower was ranked  <dig> and the rank of the jth follower was ranked j+ <dig>  when two individuals joined the movement at the same time, i considered the two individuals to have an identical rank. the joining time for all participants is defined as the time between the departure of the initiator and the departure of the last follower. the departure latency of a follower j is the time between the departure of follower j and the departure of the previous follower j -  <dig> 

data collection
accompanied by a field assistant, i scored the location of the baboon group from dawn  to dusk  throughout the study period.

initiations were only retained if at least 75% of individuals were visible and no agonistic interaction was observed  <cit> .  <dig> movements were recorded over  <dig> observation days for the large group, compared to  <dig> movements over  <dig> observation days in the small group. morning departures account for  <dig> movements in the large group and  <dig> in the small group respectively. each movement is considered as an independent event  since it is defined as a combination of several variables that are different from one movement to another  <cit> .

i split individuals into five categories: adult males, adult females without infant, adult females with infant, sub-adults and juveniles. i recorded the behaviour of individuals simultaneously because the focal individual sampling method is not appropriate for studying collective decisions  <cit> . data were collected using cyber tracker  <dig>   with a pda asus  <dig> and a palm treo  <dig>  during movement departures, i scored the rank, the time of departure and the individual category  of each individual joining a movement. the field assistant used continuous sampling to score the vocalisations associated with movements  both during movement and outside the moving context. only the frequencies of vocalisations at the group level were analysed in this study. it was often impossible to identify the emitters of vocalisations within the larger group.

data analyses
leadership: i compared the absolute frequency of initiations  between categories and between groups using a chi square test. the corrected number of initiations was defined as the number of initiations observed per category divided by the ratio of individuals of this category within the group . this corrected number of initiations per category was then divided by the sum of all corrected numbers of initiations for all categories in order to obtain a relative frequency of initiations or relative leadership. the shape of the relative leadership distribution was analysed using a curve estimation test  in order to measure how this leadership varies between categories. the ranking of categories from the highest to the lowest leadership rate made it possible to test the shape of the distribution; see  <cit>  for similar analyses. the relative frequency per category was then compared to the mean body mass of each category using a curve estimation test. animals were not weighted, meaning that body mass was estimated on the basis of the mean documented mass for each general age-sex category  <cit> . even if the measure is not exact, it provides information about the relation between the leadership rate and the body mass. a comparison was carried out between the different categories for the number of followers and the joining time for all participants via mann-whitney testing in the small group and using a kruskal-wallis test in the large group. i also analysed the distribution  of the number of followers for each group using curve estimation tests. distribution analysis is useful here to assess whether the group is either cohesive or clustered in different sub-groups.

joining and order during progression: a survival analysis was carried out on departure latencies; the shape of the inverse cumulative distribution of departure latencies was analysed using curve estimation tests. a shape following an exponential law means that the probability of individuals joining the movement is not dependent on time, but rather on the number of individuals that already joined the movement, whilst a shape following a linear curve means that the probability is time-dependent. the shape of the mean departure latencies distribution per rank was analysed using the same test. the joining process is suggested to be mimetic if this distribution is parabolic  <cit> . i calculated the mean order of progression for each category of individuals to be the frequency at which one category occupies each rank j, divided by the number of movements for which i observed each rank. i then corrected this number by the proportion of individuals in each category. i only retained ranks for which at least five movements were observed. considering this, the highest analysed rank is  <dig> for the large group, and  <dig> for the small group. the homogeneity of the absolute rank distribution was analysed using a chi square test. the relative frequency distribution per rank and for each category of individuals was analysed using curve estimation tests  <cit> . different functions  were tested and only the best-fitting function was retained to explain the observed distribution . a linear distribution of ranks indicates that a category has the same probability to occupy all ranks. a parabolic distribution  indicates that a category has more probability to be in the front and at the back of the movement. on the contrary, an inverse parabolic distribution  suggests that a category is located in the middle of the progression rather than in the front or at the back. i also compared these different distributions between groups using the same test.

communication: using the chi square test, i first analysed if the frequency of vocalisations differed between moving context and stationary context, and whether the emission of vocalisations was followed by an initiation or not. individuals took  <dig> minutes to consider a vocalisation linked to a subsequent initiation . i then assessed whether vocalisations were more frequent during morning departures, in comparison with other movements, using a mann-whitney test. i also analysed if vocalisations are emitted more before or after an initiation using a wilcoxon test. their frequency was then correlated with the number of followers and the joining time of all participants using a spearman rank correlation test. i did not test this correlation for joining time in the large group, since group members rarely moved all together, and the number of values with a similar number of followers was too weak to make the statistical testing of this correlation possible. this was not the case for the small group, since the majority of movements concerned the entire group. lastly i compared the frequency of vocalisations per movement between both groups using a mann-whitney test.

the significance level was set at  <dig> . all tests were two-tailed. i carried out statistical tests using spss  <dig>  . means are ± se.

RESULTS
leadership
leadership is not equally distributed between age and sex categories in the small group of chacma baboons . the adult male initiated more than adult females, who initiated more than sub-adults and juveniles. juveniles never initiated movements and sub-adults only did so once. this distribution of leadership  follows an exponential law . there is no difference in the number of followers between movements initiated by the adult male and those initiated by adult females . i obtained the same result for the joining time of all participants . only three failed start attempts were observed  and one movement with one follower .  <dig> % of movements included all group members and  <dig> % included ten individuals, showing that the group is cohesive  <cit> . indeed, a survival analysis showed that the inverse cumulative distribution is non linear and follows a sigmoid function with a threshold equal to the number of group members .

in the large group, leadership is not equally distributed between age and sex categories  and follows an exponential law . the adult females with infants initiated fewer movements than females without infants . no difference was observed in the number of followers between the different categories of individuals . as far as the distribution of the number of followers is concerned, all cases were observed, with  <dig> failed initiations  and  <dig> initiations  attracting  <dig> to  <dig> followers. i then categorised the number of followers by intervals of  <dig>  and found that the frequency of collective movements is the same between each of these categories . indeed, a survival analysis showed that the inverse cumulative distribution is linear . all sub-group sizes during movements were observed at the same frequency.

both groups have the same leadership distribution . the higher the mean body mass of categories, the more they are seen to lead .

joining and order during progression
survival analysis in the small group showed that the inverse cumulative distribution of departure latencies of joiners follows an exponential law  better than a linear one , meaning that the probability to join the movement is constant per time unit and equals  <dig>   <cit> . departure latency distribution according to the rank of followers follows a parabolic curve . i calculated the observation frequencies per rank for each category of individuals. the distribution of absolute frequency according to rank during progression is not homogenous for the adult male , but follows a cubic function . the male was more often located at the front  or at the back of the progression than in the middle. i obtained the same result for adult females. the distribution is not homogeneous  but follows a parabolic law . adult females occupied positions at the front and back of the progression more than in the middle. sub-adults also had specific ranks: the distribution is not homogenous  but follows a cubic function , meaning that sub-adults were rarely observed at the front of the progression but were observed at the back of the progression in the majority of cases. lastly, the distribution of juvenile ranks is not homogenous either  and follows an inverse parabolic law . contrary to other group members, juveniles were located in the central part of the progression.

the large group seems to be organized in the same way as the small group. indeed, i observed the same rule underlying the joining and order of group members. the inverse cumulative distribution of departure latencies of joiners follows an exponential law  better than a linear one : the probability of joining the movement is constant per time unit and equals  <dig> . the distribution of departure latencies according to the rank of joiners follows a parabolic curve . adult males were more often observed at the front or back of the progression: the frequency distribution per rank is not homogeneous  and follows a parabolic function . the frequency distribution per rank in adult females is not homogeneous either  and also follows a parabolic function . however, among adult females, the distribution for females without infants is heterogeneous  and follows a parabolic law  whilst the distribution for females with infants is homogeneous . sub-adults occupied certain ranks more than others  but no function fits with the distribution, even the cubic curve . the distribution in juveniles is not homogeneous  and follows an inverse parabolic curve .

results in bold indicate the best-fitting function explaining the distribution. r <dig> are adjusted according to the number of free parameters.

the inverse cumulative distribution of departure latencies in the small group is correlated to that of the large group . the exponential coefficient of these distributions  corresponds to the mean probability to join a movement, and is  <dig>  for the members of the small group and  <dig>  for members of the large group process. the functions obtained in the four categories of individuals for the small group were then transposed to the large group for the calculation of simulated frequencies per rank for each category. i then compared these simulated frequencies to the frequencies obtained in the large group. results showed that the distributions are correlated  showing that members of both groups used similar rules of progression during collective movements.

communication
the small group did not display more movements with loud calls  than without loud calls  . similarly, movements with grunts  were no more numerous than those without grunts  . however, a movement consistently followed the emission of loud calls , whilst only  <dig> % of grunt emissions were followed by a movement . there were more loud calls  and more grunts  during the morning departures compared to other movements. there were also more loud calls  and more grunts  prior to initiations than after initiations. grunts do not appear to be more numerous prior to loud call emissions than after them . the number of loud calls is not correlated to the success of the movement, either in terms of number of followers  or joining time for all participants . the same result is obtained for the relationship between the number of grunts and the number of followers  and for the joining time of all participants .

in the large group, movements with loud calls are no more numerous  than those without loud calls  . similarly, the group did not display more movements with grunts  than without grunts  . emissions of loud calls are more often followed by a movement  than by no movement at all  . however, emissions of grunts are no more frequently followed by a movement  than by no movement at all  even if there is a statistical tendency . the frequency of loud calls is higher when followed by a movement , whilst there is no difference concerning the frequency of grunts . there are more loud calls during morning departures than during other movements  but not more grunts . there are more loud calls  and more grunts  prior to initiations than after initiations. grunts are no more numerous prior to the emission of loud calls than after it . the number of loud calls  and the number of grunts  are not correlated to the number of followers.

direct comparison of the two groups in terms of absolute frequencies of loud calls and grunts per movement did not reveal any difference between groups for loud calls  but showed that the small group emitted more grunts per movement than the large group .

discussion
this study is the first to simultaneously study leadership, progression order and communication during movements in two different-sized groups of baboons. whatever the group size, group members seem to show the same rules of decision making. even if we need to confirm this result in other groups, the latter is very surprising given existing theoretical literature which suggests that small and large groups should display different mechanisms of communication and organization during movements  <cit> . this study showed that in both groups, adult males are more prone to lead the group, even if adult females and sub-adults can also initiate movements. however, there is no difference between individuals of different sex or age as far as the success of initiations is concerned. during progression, individuals seem to join the movement through mimetism or social amplification  <cit> . the parabolic shape of the distribution of latencies is typically the signature of a mimetic process where an individual displayed a behaviour according to the number of individuals already performing it  <cit> . if joining a movement followed an independence process  or a leadership process , the distribution of latencies would more follow a linear function  <cit> . however, joining order is not random, with adult males and adult females being located more often at the back or front of the movement, whilst juveniles are in the centre of the progression. lastly, baboons seem to use vocalisations on a context-dependent basis: grunts and loud calls were emitted more often before the initiations of movement than after an initiation or within other contexts. the results are similar in both groups, despite the difference in group size.

literature often associates leadership, or the frequent initiation of movements, with either dominance of group members or the philopatric sex  <cit> . few studies have showed the relationship between leadership and nutrient requirements  <cit> . in this study, adult males initiated more movements than adult females, sub-adults or juveniles in both of the groups studied. the same result was found in other studies on baboons  <cit> . however, with the exception of juveniles in the small group, all individuals seem to be able to initiate a movement and are followed to the same extent as adult males. moreover, the exponential distribution of relative leadership obtained in both groups is corrected by the number of individuals per category. if the leadership is not corrected by this ratio, it is therefore approximately the same for adult males and adult females . adult males and adult females initiated the same number of initiations , but as the ratio of adult males is lower than that of adult females, the relative leadership is higher for males . this means that the leadership is distributed among all group members even if it is biased amongst adult males. the advantages of leading a group for an individual are that he or she can not only decide on movement direction but also be the first to access resources  <cit> . adult males might also be at the front of the progression because they are larger than other group members and therefore play a role in defending the group from predators or competitor groups. leading the group might therefore be explained by dominance of individuals - high dominance may allow an individual to decide on direction and have access to resources - or could be explained by the needs of individuals - individuals with the highest needs decide which direction will be taken by the group. these two factors - dominance and needs - are often correlated, and authors mainly conclude that leadership is influenced by dominance. however, a theoretical study shows that a biased leadership in favour of adult males could emerge from differences in nutrient requirement between group members  <cit> . this theoretical study illustrates leadership distribution following the same exponential distribution as that found not only in this current study but also in another study on baboons  <cit> . adult males might be more prone to lead because they have higher nutritional needs, or in other words, because other group members as juveniles, have lower nutritional demands. however, this assumption needs to be confirmed by evaluating the independent ability of dominance rank and body mass to predict the probability of initiating a movement across individuals: if body mass significantly predicts the outcome, but dominance rank does not, one could definitively state that the nutrient-need hypothesis outperforms the dominance hypothesis.

adult males are more often at the front and back of the progression, and particularly occupy the first ranks of the progression. adult females occupy the same ranks but to a lesser extent. sub-adults are found more at the back of the group whilst juveniles are in the central part of the progression. these results have already been found in other groups of baboons  <cit>  and other groups of primates  <cit> . the main ecological reason suggested to explain this specific order is the protection of juveniles against potential predators and other groups of baboons. authors have often reported that the high cognitive skills of primates, and particularly of baboons, might allow them to adapt their behaviours  to the risk level of their environment  <cit> . however, this specific order during progression has also been described in ungulates  <cit>  and social carnivores  <cit> . in groups of plains zebras, females  are more often at the front of movements than sub-adults or juveniles  <cit> . in african buffalos, juveniles and sub-adults do not decide about movements  <cit> . females are also at the front of the movements in a herd of cattle  <cit> . in social carnivores, females are more often observed at the front of the movement, and juveniles are seldom observed at the front in species such as coatis , mongooses, lions , cap hunting dogs  or spotted hyenas   <cit> . another explanation is that simple and local rules could lead to the emergence of these complex patterns during movements  <cit> . sueur and colleagues  <cit>  showed that similar patterns of organization can be explained in macaques and lemurs by their use of mimetic rules based on physiological needs, and mimetism based on social relationships between group members. i also found a mimetic process in this study showing that an amplification rule could also be applied in the two studied groups. both studied groups displayed the same rules for order during progression, irrespective of size. however, the differences between categories for the order of progression are less pronounced in large groups. there is more noise, firstly because of the large group size , but probably also due to the existence of sub-groups. indeed, large troops of baboons are often composed of different sub-groups. these sub-groups are of different sizes. composed of adult males, females and juveniles, they have their own organization  <cit>  leading to multiple combinations at the group level.

vocal communication is not necessary between members of either group for movement decisions  <cit> , nor is this acoustic communication necessary for an initiator to be followed by its conspecifics. in this context, the 'visual contact' between individuals appears to be enough for group coordination  <cit>  and communication would be only local, which is reminiscent of self-organized processes  <cit> . however, this study shows that vocalizations, especially loud calls, are emitted more in the context of collective movements. these loud calls are also more frequently emitted before the initiation of a movement than after it. this result is reminiscent of the vocalisations emitted in female gorillas before the silverback initiated a movement  <cit> , but also the group ceremony preceding initiations in social carnivores  <cit>  or the pre-departure processes also described in ungulates or macaques  <cit> . however, it is impossible to conclude from this study that the frequency of these loud calls influences decision-making for an initiation or affects its success. other studies on baboons have also failed to show a direct effect of vocalisations on the recruitment process  <cit> . instead of having a direct effect on the joining process, such as recruiting partners, these vocalizations might only be used to signal the motivation to move, and lead in some way to a better coordination of individuals  <cit> . under the global communication hypothesis, i expected the large group to emit more vocalisations than the small one. however, i found that the small group emitted the same number of loud calls per movement and more grunts than the large group. this seems to show that local communication was used more than global communication between individuals within the large group. global communication might not be so efficient when the group size becomes too large, as conradt and roper  <cit>  have already stipulated. indeed, as the group size increases, the mean distance between two individuals also increases  and the probability of information transmission decreases. this leads the communication to be more local than global  <cit> . another explanation might be that members of the small group emitted more vocalisations because the cohesiveness in this group is stronger and the reasons to remain cohesive are more numerous than in the large one. there is still a lot to be done if we wish to gain a clear understanding of coordination differences between small and large groups, so further studies are necessary in order to assess coordination mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a clarification of mechanisms underlying the emergence of leadership and the complex patterns of organization during movements in baboons. however, these rules can also be applied in other species, primates or non primates. physiological differences between individuals, coupled to social amplification based on social relationships, seem to be crucial factors affecting collective decisions. however, further experimental and theoretical studies are necessary before we can disentangle the influences of the different variables affecting the patterns of collective movements.
