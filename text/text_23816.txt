BACKGROUND
the ubiquitously expressed vertebrate non-transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase shp- <dig> takes part in intracellular signal transduction induced by a variety of environmental cues and plays an important role in diverse cellular processes  <cit> . the shp- <dig> protein consists of  <dig> residues, with the first  <dig> residues comprising two src homology  <dig> domains  and the remainder a protein tyrosine phosphatase domain  and the c-terminal tail. the  <dig>  Å x-ray crystal structure of shp- <dig>  <cit>  reveals that the ptp catalytic site is blocked by the formation of an intramolecular protein – protein interface between ptp and the n-terminal sh <dig> domain , thereby providing a structural explanation for the low baseline shp- <dig> tyrosine phosphatase activity  <cit> . in addition to self-inhibiting catalysis, n-sh <dig>  like the second  sh <dig> domain , has the capacity to selectively bind phosphotyrosine  peptides of a particular sequence  <cit> . thus, shp- <dig> can be recruited to different regions of the cell via the interaction of its n-sh <dig> or c-sh <dig> domains with particular py-peptides localized in these different regions.

crystal structures of n-sh <dig> alone, both with and without bound py-peptides  <cit> , show an open py-peptide binding cleft between the ef loop  and the bg loop . this is in contrast to the crystal structure of the complete self-inhibited protein wherein the ptp-bound n-sh2's peptide-binding cleft is closed due to ef-loop motion and therefore unable to accommodate a py-peptide . these structural studies, combined with biochemical evidence  <cit> , imply that py-peptide binding and disruption of the intramolecular n-sh <dig> – ptp interface, and hence activation of phosphatase activity, are normally coupled. mutations at the protein – protein interface that disrupt the interface leading to the active form of the protein are associated with the congenital disease noonan syndrome as well as childhood leukemias  <cit> . accordingly, it may be anticipated that small-molecule inhibitors of either shp- <dig> sh <dig> py-peptide binding or ptp activity have the potential to serve as novel research tools and as potential precursors to therapeutics. to better understand the biochemical properties of the n-sh <dig> domain with the aim of developing n-sh2-specific inhibitors, we have used molecular dynamics  simulations to investigate the closed-to-open transition of the n-sh <dig> py-peptide binding cleft. our data suggest that tyr <dig> plays an important role in this conformational switching.

RESULTS
n-sh <dig> py-peptide binding cleft width in experimental crystal structures
the width of the py-peptide binding cleft, formed by the ef  and bg  loops, can be characterized by the distance between the cα atoms of gly <dig> and asn <dig> . in the crystal structure of the full shp- <dig> protein   <cit> , which consists of a 525-residue polypeptide comprising the two sh <dig> domains followed by the ptp domain and in the self-inhibited conformation, this distance is  <dig>  Å and the cleft is in the closed conformation. in contrast, in the crystal structure of isolated n-sh <dig> without bound peptide   <cit>  this distance is substantially longer at  <dig>  Å, and reflects the fact that the cleft is open. interestingly, in crystal structures of n-sh <dig> complexed with py peptides, this distance assumes values of  <dig>  Å ,  <dig>  Å , and  <dig>  Å   <cit> . the near-identical cleft widths in the isolated n-sh <dig> crystal structures both in the presence and absence of bound py-peptide imply that, when not bound to ptp, n-sh <dig> adopts a conformation with an open py-peptide binding cleft that is pre-arranged to bind py-peptide. the open cleft conformation is thus more thermodynamically favorable than the closed conformation when n-sh <dig> is not bound to ptp, in contrast to the ptp-bound conformation in which the cleft is closed.

molecular dynamics simulations
molecular dynamics  simulations complement crystallographic structural data by providing a direct view of structural fluctuations and conformational changes at the nanosecond timescale. consequently, transitions between two conformationally different crystal structures of the same protein can be directly probed via simulations. for example, if simulations starting from two different crystallographic conformations converge to one of the two conformations, it can be inferred that that sampled conformation is more stable and that there is a low or non-existent energy barrier for the transition. if, on the other hand, the crystallographic conformations are maintained, a barrier exists that prevents the transition on the time scale of the simulation.

to characterize the conformational properties of the n-sh <dig> py-peptide binding cleft, all-atom nanosecond-scale explicit-solvent md simulations at a temperature of  <dig> k and pressure of  <dig> atm were performed on isolated n-sh <dig> and the full shp- <dig> protein, all in the absence of py-peptide. the simulations included all protein and solvent degrees-of-freedom and thus can be used to probe the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the solvated proteins at an atomic level-of-detail. three systems were constructed using two x-ray crystal structures. two systems were of the isolated n-sh <dig> domain, one having an open py-peptide binding cleft as the starting conformation and the second having a closed py-peptide binding cleft. the third system was of the full shp- <dig> protein in which the cleft is closed. table  <dig> summarizes the crystal structures used for system construction, the residue span, and the py-peptide binding cleft conformation for the three systems, as well as the abbreviations used in the text to describe each system. all three systems were solvated with water molecules and neutralizing counterions, and were of a size such that a minimum of a 14-Å layer of water surrounded the protein on all sides. the resultant concentrations were  <dig> mm for the n-sh <dig> domain systems and  <dig> mm for the full shp- <dig> system. the simulations were done using periodic boundary conditions to prevent boundary artifacts. under periodic boundary conditions, the system sees its own image in all directions and when a molecule drifts out of one side of the system, it drifts back in from the opposite side. further simulation details are described in the methods section.

to test for equilibration of the md simulations of the three systems, time courses for the cα root mean square deviations  relative to the respective crystal structures as well as average system energies were calculated. rmsd and average energy data correlate with how thoroughly the protein has relaxed in response to the surrounding environment and how thoroughly the environment has relaxed in response to the protein. the two 10-ns n-sh <dig> simulations reach plateaus in both average energy and rmsd by  <dig> ns  and are thus well-equilibrated on the timescale of the simulations. the fluctuation in rmsd near the end of the 1ayd:n-sh <dig> simulation is solely due to motion in the n- and c-terminal residues, which are both on the opposite face of the protein as the binding cleft. the full shp- <dig> system shows more limited convergence than the n-sh <dig> systems owing to its larger size, which both increases the timescale for equilibration and hinders longer sampling because of computational cost. nonetheless, the simulation statistics are relatively constant during the 3– <dig> ns interval and show that the system has largely finished relaxation by  <dig> ns . given that the rmsd and average energy time courses reach equilibrium values by  <dig> ns for all three simulations, only molecular dynamics snapshots after the 3-ns time point were used for further analysis.

to investigate the conformational change in the py-peptide binding cleft, average structures of n-sh <dig> from the 1ayd:n-sh <dig>  2shp:n-sh <dig>  and 2shp:shp- <dig> md trajectories were calculated. conformations sampled every  <dig> -ns were rms-aligned to their respective crystal structures using all atoms in residues 1– <dig>  average coordinates were then calculated for these aligned conformations for the 3– <dig> ns interval of the 2shp:shp- <dig> simulation and for the 3– <dig> ns and 5– <dig> ns intervals for the 1ayd:n-sh <dig> and 2shp:n-sh <dig> simulations. the 1ayd:n-sh <dig> 3– <dig> ns and 5– <dig> ns average structures both had large gly <dig> cα – asn <dig> cα distances, consistent with a wide py-peptide binding cleft. their values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, as compared to the crystallographic distance of  <dig>  Å. in contrast, distances from the two simulations initiated from the shp- <dig> crystal structure were smaller, consistent with a narrow cleft, and similar to the crystallographic distance of  <dig>  Å. these values were  <dig>  Å for 2shp:shp-2:3– <dig> ns,  <dig>  Å for 2shp:n-sh2:3– <dig> ns, and  <dig>  Å for 2shp:n-sh2:5– <dig> ns. the upward drift in the 2shp:n-sh <dig> values is accounted for by changes in the bg loop backbone conformation that bring it into consensus with the isolated n-sh <dig> crystal conformation, as detailed subsequently. nonetheless, this n-sh <dig> domain system with the closed cleft, which was constructed using the full shp- <dig> crystal structure, does not relax fully to the open cleft conformation despite the absence of the ptp domain.

backbone φ/ψ angles for residues  <dig> to  <dig> in the crystal structures and the average structures were calculated for a detailed comparison of the backbone conformations that correspond to the different py-peptide binding-cleft widths. residues were classified as being in extended , helical , left-handed helical , gamma , and ii'  regions of φ/ψ space . of the  <dig> residues in this span,  <dig> have the same secondary structure across both of the crystal structures and all five of the simulation average structures. the residues in which differences occur are  <dig>  65– <dig>  85– <dig>  and 90– <dig>  with  <dig> of these  <dig> being conformationally labile gly residues. this set of  <dig> residues largely overlaps the residue ranges of the ef  and bg  loops, which indicates the conformational variability of the two loops.

bg loop conformation depends on n-sh <dig> – ptp binding
analysis of the backbone conformation of the three systems' bg loops shows that the two simulations of n-sh <dig> converge to a common structure resembling that from the crystal of isolated n-sh <dig>  whereas the crystallographic bg loop conformation in the full shp- <dig> protein is maintained in the simulation of the full shp- <dig> protein. the 1ayd:n-sh <dig> 3– <dig> ns and 2shp:n-sh <dig> 3– <dig> ns average conformations assume the same secondary structure for residues 90– <dig>  ehhl, one that is nearly the same as the isolated n-sh <dig> crystal structure and is maintained in the 5– <dig> ns interval average structures. in contrast, the 2shp:shp- <dig> 3– <dig> ns average conformation maintains the 2shp crystallographic secondary structure for glu <dig> and lys <dig>  thus, maintenance of the ptp-bound secondary structure of the n-sh <dig> bg loop  requires that n-sh <dig> be bound to ptp, although residues in the vicinity of the loop  can undergo conformational changes. in the absence of this protein – protein interface, the bg loop relaxes to a conformation consistent with the crystallographic conformation of the bg loop in isolated n-sh <dig>  interestingly, the n-sh <dig> bg loop has no direct contact with ptp in the shp- <dig> crystal structure. the difference in bg loop conformations between the ptp-bound and unbound n-sh <dig> states implies conformational coupling: a preference for a particular bg loop conformation is induced by interaction of a different portion of the n-sh <dig> domain with the ptp-domain, thereby communicating the presence of the ptp-domain to the bg loop.

ef loop conformation correlates with the tyr <dig> backbone conformation
contrasting behavior is observed in the ef loop  where, unlike the bg loop in the n-sh <dig> simulations, structural convergence does not occur. in all three simulations the backbone conformation for tyr <dig> is retained relative to that of the respective crystals, while those of the two glycine residues  show more conformational flexibility . for tyr <dig>  the 1ayd:n-sh <dig> average structures maintain the crystallographic left-handed helical backbone conformation, l, whereas the 2shp:n-sh <dig> and 2shp:shp- <dig> average structures maintain the crystallographic extended backbone conformation, e. the adjacent leu <dig> does exhibit an e-to-h transition in one of the two n-sh <dig> domain simulations, but this is a small conformational change as the crystallographic φ/ψ values are -113/ <dig> for this residue such that only a 2° change in the ψ angle is required to effect the change in classification. these results indicate tyr <dig> to be the key difference in the two n-sh2-domain simulations, since it is the only non-gly residue whose backbone conformation is both different in the two crystals and does not show conformational convergence in the simulations.

supporting the important role of tyr <dig> in dictating the conformation of the ef loop is the correlation between the cleft-width, as measured by the gly <dig> cα – asn <dig> cα distance , and the tyr <dig> backbone conformation. when tyr <dig> is in the extended region of φ/ψ space, the cleft is closed and when tyr <dig> is in the left-handed helix region of φ/ψ space, the cleft is open. thus although six residues among the seven that compose the ef and bg loops have different conformations in the two crystal structures, the backbone conformation of tyr <dig> appears to be a key factor in the closed-to-open conformational change in the py-peptide binding cleft. this observation motivated additional calculations to validate tyr <dig> as a conformational switch dictating the structure of the ef loop.

deep free-energy minima keep the tyr <dig> backbone locked in position
to obtain a quantitative estimate of the energetics associated with the conformational change in tyr <dig>  free-energy simulations were carried out using the final n-sh <dig> domain conformations from the 1ayd:n-sh <dig> and 2shp:n-sh <dig> simulations. by applying restraining potentials to the φ/ψ dihedrals of tyr <dig>  tyr <dig> conformations in the neighborhood of these final conformations were preferentially sampled while averaging over all other protein degrees of freedom. the data were appropriately re-weighted and combined to yield effective free-energy surfaces, or "potentials-of-mean-force" , as a function of the tyr <dig> backbone conformation. these pmfs reveal the free-energy barriers to changes in tyr <dig> backbone conformation for solvated n-sh <dig> at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

from the pmf data, displacements of only  <dig> to  <dig> degrees in either the φ or ψ coordinate of the tyr <dig> backbone translate to increases in free energy of  <dig> or more kcal/mol . thus, in the open cleft state, tyr <dig> is constrained to a small portion of φ/ψ space corresponding to a left-handed helical conformation, and in the closed cleft state tyr <dig> is constrained to a small portion of φ/ψ space corresponding to an extended conformation. these deep and well-defined free-energy minima serve to lock tyr <dig> into a particular backbone conformation, thereby explaining the lack of ef loop relaxation to a consensus conformation in the two 10-ns molecular dynamics trajectories of isolated n-sh <dig> .

if indeed tyr <dig> is the key residue that modulates the closed-to-open transition of the py-peptide binding cleft, the fact that it is constrained to two small regions of φ/ψ space allows it to act like a molecular switch. intermediate states become very unlikely because they are high in free energy and therefore the ef loop is in either the closed or open conformation depending on the tyr <dig> backbone conformation, and not in some intermediate state. the pmf data are corroborated by the nanosecond-scale md simulations. in the case of 2shp:n-sh <dig> and 2shp:shp- <dig>  tyr <dig> only samples φ/ψ conformations confined to the "closed" contours illustrated in figure  <dig> while 1ayd:n-sh <dig> samples conformations confined to the "open" contours .

a change in the tyr <dig> backbone conformation induces a conformational change in the ef loop
to test the ability of tyr <dig> to act as a conformational switch in the closed-to-open transition of the shp- <dig> n-sh <dig> py-peptide binding cleft, simulations were performed in which conversion between the left-handed helical  and extended  tyr <dig> backbone conformations was induced, both in the forward and backward directions. starting with the final conformation from the 10-ns 2shp:n-sh <dig> simulation, in which the tyr <dig> backbone was in the "e" conformation, an e-to-l transition was induced over the course of  <dig> ns using restraining potentials on the tyr <dig> φ and ψ angles and following the reaction path shown in figure  <dig>  similarly, starting with the final conformation from the 10-ns 1ayd:n-sh <dig> simulation, in which the tyr <dig> backbone was in the "l" conformation, an l-to-e transition was induced. the basis for the selection of this path, versus the more direct path between the two states, was its energetic accessibility as judged by the conformational energies of the charmm backbone force field as included in figure  <dig>  these two sets of simulations directly test whether an induced change in the backbone of tyr <dig> can cause a transition between the closed and open states of the py-peptide binding cleft.

average conformations calculated from  <dig> snapshots spaced  <dig>  ps apart, both at the beginning and end of each of the two induced transitions, reveal the direct effect that the e-to-l and l-to-e tyr <dig> conformational changes have on py-peptide binding cleft width. the tyr <dig> e-to-l transition causes a closed-to-open transition in the binding cleft and the l-to-e transition causes an open-to-closed binding cleft transition. after alignment of the pair of average structures from the e-to-l transition using the cα atoms of the structurally invariant residues  <dig> to  <dig> , the cα atoms of all three residues in the ef loop have moved away from the center of the cleft . the average position of tyr <dig> cα has been displaced by  <dig>  Å, gly <dig> by  <dig>  Å, and gly <dig> by  <dig>  Å. the same alignment using the average structures from the endpoints of the l-to-e transition  reveals the opposite motion, with the cα atoms of all three residues moving toward the center of the cleft . the average position of tyr <dig> cα has been displaced by  <dig>  Å, gly <dig> by  <dig>  Å, and gly <dig> by  <dig>  Å. these data provide direct evidence that tyr <dig>  and in particular its backbone conformation, acts as a conformational switch that can control the relative positioning of the ef loop and thereby effect the closed-to-open binding cleft transition.

the role of the tyr <dig> sidechain
visual analysis indicates sidechain – sidechain interactions involving tyr <dig> help to anchor the open form of the ef loop and pull the sidechain away from the entrance to the wide py-peptide binding cleft. in contrast, in the closed form this sidechain has no interactions with other parts of the protein and partially occludes the entrance to the narrow cleft . this difference in sidechain positioning and interactions is due not only to the differences in tyr <dig> backbone conformation, and hence ef loop position, but also to a difference in the χ <dig> dihedral of the residue's sidechain. due to the sp2-hybridized cγ and the internal symmetry of the sidechain, tyr <dig> has two equivalent minima at χ <dig> = ± 90°. therefore, when the sidechain is in a local minimum, only φ, ψ and χ <dig> are required to denote its geometry.

for a three-fold rotation like χ <dig>  local minima exist at idealized values of -60°, 60°, and 180°. crystallographically, in the open conformation  χ1/χ <dig> = - <dig> °/ <dig> °, and in the closed conformation  χ1/χ <dig> = - <dig> °/- <dig> °. thus, with the cleft open  χ <dig> exists in the -60° minimum and with the cleft closed  χ <dig> is in the 180° minimum. the combination of the open ef loop conformation due to the left-handed helical tyr <dig> backbone and the χ <dig> angle in the -60° minimum pins the tyr <dig> sidechain to the surface of the n-sh <dig> domain . its close proximity to other surface amino acids enables the formation of hydrogen bonding and π-stacking with two other sidechains, thereby reinforcing the open conformation. in particular, in the crystallographic open form tyr <dig> acts as a hydrogen-bond donor with respect to asp <dig> and participates in π-stacking with gln <dig> .

the interactions involving tyr <dig> appear to be unique to shp- <dig> and the closely related shp- <dig>  blast  <cit>  alignment of the shp- <dig> n-sh <dig> sequence shows that other homologous human sh <dig> domains do not have a tyrosine residue at this position, though they sometimes possess one or both subsequent glycine residues, and blast search of the 11-residue span with the ygg sequence in its middle yields only shp- <dig> and shp- <dig>  such lack of homology suggests a potentially unique role of tyr <dig> in the shps.

the stability of the χ <dig> angle and its correlation with the state of the ef loop is evidenced in the md trajectories. the trajectory of isolated n-sh <dig> in which the ef loop is in the open conformation  maintains crystallographically-consistent χ <dig> values in the -60° minimum. likewise, the trajectories of the n-sh <dig> domain in which the ef loop is in the closed conformation  sample χ <dig> values in the 180° minimum . surprisingly, unlike the trajectories of the isolated n-sh <dig> domain in which χ <dig> exclusively samples the crystallographic minimum, the trajectory of the full shp- <dig> protein sees a fluctuation from its crystallographic minimum to the other crystallographic minimum and back again. this conformational fluctuation suggests that though χ <dig> is involved in the closed-to-open transition, it is comparatively labile with respect to the backbone conformation of tyr <dig> φ/ψ, which by itself is able to cause ef loop motion between the closed and open states and stays locked in either the extended or left-handed helical state for the full duration of the 10-ns n-sh <dig> and 5-ns shp- <dig> molecular dynamics trajectories. this sidechain mobility is also evident in the simulation in which the open-to-closed transition is induced. there, as forces applied to the tyr <dig> backbone induce the l-to-e backbone transition, χ <dig> spontaneously transitions from the -60° minimum to the 180° minimum.

the simulation of isolated n-sh <dig> started from the open-cleft isolated n-sh <dig> crystal structure shows the tyr <dig> – asn <dig> sidechain – sidechain hydrogen bonding and the tyr <dig> – gln <dig> π-stacking as in that crystal structure. additionally, tyr <dig> – lys <dig> sidechain – sidechain hydrogen bonding is observed; this interaction is consistent with the crystal structure because crystallographically these sidechains are in close proximity, though atoms beyond lys cδ are missing crystal coordinates, presumably due to conformational flexibility . the simulation data also reveal the fluctuating nature of these sidechain – sidechain interactions. for example, gln <dig> alternates between π-stacking and hydrogen bonding with the tyr <dig> sidechain. asp <dig> during the first 5-ns goes back and forth between direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonding with tyr <dig> and drifts out of hydrogen bonding distance during the last 5-ns. and lys <dig> forms both direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonding networks with the tyr <dig> sidechain over the full  <dig> ns. taken separately, the tyr <dig> interactions with the three sidechains from asp <dig>  lys <dig>  and gln <dig> are transient and therefore weak. however, when combined these residues anchor the tyr <dig> sidechain to the surface of the domain and away from the opening to the py-peptide binding cleft.

when the tyr <dig> sidechain is freed from interaction with these three sidechains and can partially occlude the cleft, the three sidechains themselves form a hydrogen-bonding complex. in this complex the sidechain of lys <dig> serves as a hydrogen-bond donor to the asp <dig> and gln <dig> sidechains both in the shp- <dig> crystal structure and the simulations . as with the tyr <dig> sidechain interactions in the open-cleft form, direct interactions between these three sidechains are transient in the md simulations started from the open-cleft n-sh <dig> structure. in the case of 2shp:n-sh <dig>  the asp <dig> – lys <dig> hydrogen bond fluctuates during the first  <dig> ns whereas it remains stably formed during the last  <dig> ns. the gln <dig> – lys <dig> hydrogen bond present at the beginning of this trajectory is lost when a water molecule intercedes, but the interaction among the three sidechains is maintained by the formation of a hydrogen bond between the gln <dig> and asp <dig> sidechains. likewise, there is an interaction triad involving asp <dig>  lys <dig>  and gln <dig> in the case of 2shp:shp- <dig>  however, during the 3– <dig> ns interval χ <dig> fluctuates to the -60° minimum , allowing the tyr <dig> sidechain to form a persistent hydrophobic interaction with the aliphatic sidechain atoms of lys <dig> and transient hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions with the sidechain of gln <dig>  after this interval, χ <dig> reverts to its crystallographic conformation in the 180° minimum. thus, when the ef loop is in its closed conformation, the fully solvent-exposed tyr <dig> sidechain is sufficiently mobile as to be able to sample the open-cleft χ <dig> conformation that puts it in contact with other amino acids on the n-sh <dig> surface and away from the entrance to the binding cleft.

in summary, weak solvent-exposed interactions involving the sidechains of tyr <dig>  asp <dig>  lys <dig>  and gln <dig> are important to the sidechain conformation of tyr <dig>  when the cleft is open, asp <dig>  lys <dig>  and gln <dig> all interact with the tyr <dig> sidechain and pin it to the surface of the protein and away from the cleft opening. conversely, when the cleft is closed, asp <dig>  lys <dig>  and gln <dig> form an interaction triad, freeing the tyr <dig> sidechain from being tied to the surface of the protein and allowing it to become fully solvent exposed and to partially occlude the cleft.

CONCLUSIONS
the shp- <dig> n-sh <dig> tyr <dig> backbone exists in two well-defined conformations, extended or left-handed helical, owing to the presence of free-energy barriers that encircle small low-free-energy regions in φ/ψ space. conversion from one backbone conformation to the other leads to motion of the n-sh <dig> ef loop and a change in the width of the py-peptide binding cleft between the ef and bg loops. thus, with two well-defined positions that control the position of the ef loop, tyr <dig> acts as a conformational switch that determines the state of the binding cleft as either closed or open. with an extended backbone conformation at tyr <dig>  the binding cleft is closed and consistent with the self-inhibited shp- <dig> conformation in which n-sh <dig> and ptp form a protein – protein interface. conversely, with a left-handed helical backbone conformation at tyr <dig>  the binding cleft becomes open, n-sh <dig> is able to localize shp- <dig> to a particular region of the intracellular space via py-peptide binding, and the ptp catalytic site is exposed and phosphatase activity increases.

such conformational switching is in contrast to another possible scenario in which a continuum of tyr <dig> backbone, and hence ef loop, conformations exists. in such a case, rigidification of the binding cleft into either the closed or open state would be associated with an entropic cost and hence a free-energy penalty. py-peptide binding necessarily must be relatively weak so as to be readily reversible, as required for its role in intracellular signal transduction  <cit> . this is reflected in the interface between n-sh <dig> and py-peptides, wherein only the portion of the py-peptide that is in between the bg and ef loops is buried to a significant extent. the rest of the py-peptide forms a relatively flat interface with n-sh <dig>  in contrast to strong protein – peptide binding interactions in which a significant portion of peptide is deeply buried in the protein  <cit> . if in addition to burying only a small portion of the peptide, significant loop entropy must also be overcome for py-peptide binding, the interaction would be weaker still and this might negatively impact the ability of n-sh <dig> to mediate shp- <dig> localization and activation. consequently, we predict a tyr66gly mutation would significantly weaken the ability of n-sh <dig> to bind py-peptides.

a possible binding mechanism is suggested by the transition in tyr <dig> χ <dig> conformation in the simulation of the full self-inhibited shp- <dig> protein. the sidechain transition from the crystallographic closed-cleft χ <dig> minimum to the open-cleft χ <dig> minimum and back again shows that this sidechain does not always occlude the entrance to the binding cleft when n-sh <dig> is bound to ptp. py-peptide could form an initial contact between its phosphotyrosine and immediately adjacent residues and the surface of n-sh <dig> corresponding to the py, py- <dig>  and py+ <dig> positions. this initial contact would then be followed by secondary py-peptide contact with the ef and bg loops that was facilitated by spontaneous fluctuation of the tyr <dig> sidechain away from its cleft-occluding position and into contact with lys <dig> and gln <dig>  the secondary contact would serve to open the py-peptide binding cleft, thereby securing the full n-sh <dig> – py-peptide binding interaction, inducing conformational changes in the ef and bg loops , and leading to loss of the n-sh <dig> – ptp interface and exposure of the ptp catalytic site. at this point, the tyr <dig> sidechain would be pinned away from the binding cleft entrance by the formation of interactions with asp <dig> as well as lys <dig> and gln <dig> 

such interactions involving tyr <dig> as a conformational switch also suggest a possible role for this and surrounding residues in the regulation of shp activity and cellular localization. interactions with environmental factors, such as ions or other peptides, that impact the conformation of tyr <dig> would facilitate either opening or closing of the py-peptide binding cleft. such changes would thereby favor or disfavor binding leading to alterations in the phosphatase activity and to cellular localization. while such a role is speculative, the present results suggest mutations that may be used to experimentally investigate this hypothesis. mutations at tyr <dig> to amino acids with large sidechains that cannot form hydrogen-bond/salt-bridge and/or π interactions may destabilize the open conformation in which tyr <dig> sidechain interactions help to keep the sidechain away from the binding cleft entrance, thereby weakening peptide binding. similarly, mutation of asp <dig>  lys <dig>  and/or gln <dig> to ala would weaken the ability of these residues to pin tyr <dig> to the protein surface and away from the binding site entrance, and again adversely affect py-peptide binding, and therefore cellular localization and phosphatase activation.

the fact that the ef loop position is well-defined is fortuitous from an inhibitor-design perspective, as the open conformation, which is thermodynamically more favorable based on the crystallographic data, can be targeted using structure-based inhibitor-design methods without complications due to the effects of ef-loop entropy and induced fit on small-molecule binding. recent work on the py-peptide binding-specificities of shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> suggests that the ef loop – bg loop cleft confers specificity, thus it may be possible to develop inhibitors targeting the cleft that not only block py-peptide binding, but also preferentially do so for shp- <dig> versus shp- <dig>  <cit> . such inhibitors can serve as research tools in the investigation of leukemia- and noonan syndrome-associated shp- <dig> mutants that have lost the ability to form the n-sh <dig> – ptp interface characteristic of the self-inhibited wild-type shp- <dig>  these mutants have constitutive high phosphatase activity  <cit>  and increased n-sh <dig> py-peptide binding affinity  <cit> . shp- <dig> n-sh <dig> inhibitors would be useful in probing the importance of increased localization versus increased phosphatase activity in these mutants, and would also have the potential to serve as precursors to therapeutics.
