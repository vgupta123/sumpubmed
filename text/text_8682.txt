BACKGROUND
inflammatory bowel disease , affecting an estimated two million people annually in the us  <cit> , is predominantly comprised of crohn's disease  and ulcerative colitis . ibd is a set of chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorders of the intestine caused by multifactorial conditions in a genetically predisposed individual. uc primarily affects the mucosal lining of the colon and rectum, whereas cd may extend to any part of the gastrointestinal tract and is characterized by transmural inflammation  <cit> . since the etiology of both cd and uc remains unclear, successful treatment strategies targeting wider sections of the population have not been found. in recent years meta-analyses of clinical trials have been performed in several instances to establish efficacy of antibiotic and other therapies. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as asacol, and immune-suppressive agents are commonly used to treat ibd alone or in combination with short-term antibiotic therapies  <cit> . while adjunct antibiotic therapies may be useful  <cit> , their long term use is not common for reasons beyond the scope of discussion here. other oral therapies generally for long term remission and to prevent flare-up, to which not all patients adequately respond, are often combined with surgical interventions of the colon. patients with prolonged uc are at an increased risk for developing colitis-associated cancer   <cit> . long-term use of some ibd therapies can reduce the risk of cac by 75-81% in responding patients  <cit> . side effects of existing treatments, such as kidney damage from long-term use of mesalamine  or increased risk of infections from use of immune suppressive agents are common  <cit> . the lack of efficacious drugs to treat the general patient population, combined with the prevalence of negative side effects, emphasizes the need for the development of new, effective, and well-tolerated anti-inflammatory therapies for uc. alternative treatments, including botanical therapies, have been proposed  <cit> . unfortunately, objective evidence of consistent efficacy and safety of botanical products is generally nonexistent, despite their gain in public acceptance  <cit> .

a combination of genetic susceptibility factors and an altered immune response driven by enteric microbial factors and oxidative stress, contributes to the initiation and chronification of ibd as suggested by various animal models  <cit> . chemically induced intestinal inflammation is among the most commonly used ibd animal models, as the onset of inflammation is immediate and the procedure is relatively straightforward. among the chemical models, the dextran sodium sulfate-  induced model of bowel inflammation can be adapted for the study of both acute and chronic colitis and can be extended for the study of cac  <cit> . in addition, the dss-induced model recreates some important immunological and histopathological aspects of ibd occurring in humans.

isothiocyanates  are naturally occurring sulfur-containing compounds commonly found in brassicaceae family vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower, watercress and broccoli  <cit> . phenethylisothiocyanate  is a well-studied itc, occurring naturally in the form of its glucosinolate precursor, gluconasturtiin. barbarea verna is a brassicaceous herb that is used in salads, soups, and garnishes and in our study is one of the richest sources of dietary peitc, with the highest levels contained in the seeds  <cit> . peitc showed chemopreventive activity against various cancers  <cit>  and no apparent toxicity even when administered in high doses in rats and dogs as determined by noel  in drug safety studies  <cit> . it is also known for other beneficial effects such as anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities  <cit> . peitc inhibited nuclear factor kappab  activity in colon cancer cells and macrophages  <cit> . our previous study  <cit>  showed that peitc was the most effective of several itcs tested in suppressing expression of nfκb-regulated proinflammatory genes. in the same study peo  had strong anti-inflammatory activity, reducing paw edema in rats with an effect that was comparable to that of the reference drug aspirin administered at the same concentration  <cit> . research shows that peitc is stable in biological samples and has high oral bioavailability in rats  <cit> . here, we report the efficacy of peo in alleviating clinical signs of dss-induced acute and chronic colitis in mice. using in vivo and in vitro models, we have measured effects of peo on disease activity index, histological parameters, and changes in proinflammatory cytokine levels as well as changes in expression and activation of a key transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription . to the best of our knowledge no prior report has evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of peitc on ibd in mammalian models.

methods
chemicals and biochemicals
antibiotics, dimethyl sulphoxide , lps  and peitc standard were purchased from sigma chemicals , 5-amino salicylic acid  from tci america  and dss from mp biomedicals . all other chemicals, including cell culture media, were obtained from invitrogen inc. . reagents used in quantitative pcr, including enzymes, were supplied by stratagene inc. , cress seeds  from kitazawa seed company  and raw  <dig>  cell line  from american type culture collection . all antibodies were obtained from santa cruz biotechnology inc , unless otherwise mentioned.

preparation of peo
peo  was extracted by hydro distillation of ground winter cress seed as was previously described in ribnicky et al.,  <cit>  and dey et al.,  <cit> . gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy  was used to confirm the purity of the obtained peo. the samples were injected into a hewlett-packard mass spectrometer  equipped with a 30-m ×  <dig>  mm db- <dig> ms fused silica capillary column . chromatographic parameters were as previously described  <cit> . the retention time of peitc is  <dig>  min. the major ion of peitc has a mass of  <dig>  and molecular ion of mass  <dig> . the abundance of these ions and the integration value of the entire peak were used together with standard curves created previously from a peitc chemical standard  to quantify the peitc in peo.

in vivo animal studies
all studies were performed in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals as adopted and promulgated by the u.s. national institutes of health. c57bl/6j male mice, seven weeks old, were used. the mice were housed in a room maintained at a constant temperature of 24-26°c with 12-h light/dark cycle and had free access to food  and drinking water. before the start of experiments, one week was allowed for their acclimatization to these conditions. two murine models of colitis, the chronic and acute, were used following aharoni et al.,  <cit>  and wirtz et al.,  <cit> . the mice were randomized into four groups, which are described in table  <dig>  for the acute and chronic models, each of the groups, except healthy controls, consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> animals respectively, housed 3- <dig> per cage. the healthy control  consisted of  <dig> animals in both experiments. development  of clinical signs was not anticipated in this group, hence the small number was determined to be sufficient. treating this group with vehicle helped to account for any stress among animals due to daily oral gavage.

* statistical significance of treatments of peo and 5-asa groups are shown with respect to dss group, unless otherwise mentioned

 <dig>  acute model of colitis: acute ulcerative colitis was induced by freshly prepared 3% dss  in drinking water for five days . in a separate experiment we had previously tested various dss concentrations  for acute disease development . at a concentration higher than 3% dss, some deaths occurred that corresponded with severity of clinical signs. therefore, we used the highest tolerated concentration of 3% for our actual experiment. mice were observed individually once a day for their general health conditions, including body weight, diarrhea, rectal bleeding and inflammation and rectal prolapse. occult bleeding was tested daily in stool per cage using a commercial coloscreen kit . disease activity index   was determined following the scheme shown in table  <dig>  on the 15th day post-treatment, mice were sacrificed using carbon dioxide inhalation. colons were collected terminally, measured for their gross length, and flushed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium  containing  <dig> μg/ml gentamycin . entire colons were then stored in histology cassettes immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. paraffin cross-sections  were stained with hematoxylin and eosin  for histological evaluation  of colonic damage. histopathological assessment was performed in a blinded manner following the published scoring system  <cit>  .

* rectal prolapse was only observed in the chronic model

 <dig>  chronic model of colitis: chronic colitis was induced by four cycles of  <dig> days of alternating dss and tap water  . each 9-day cycle consisted of  <dig> days of  <dig> % dss, followed by  <dig> days of tap water. treatment regimens and sacrifice of mice were the same as in acute model except that necropsy was carried out on day  <dig>  five samples from each group, except water group, were collected for histopathology as described for the acute model, and remaining five were collected for full thickness organ culture as described by wirtz et al.,  <cit> . similarly for the control water group, two were collected for full thickness organ culture and two for histopathology. all clinical assessments were performed as described for acute model above.

organ culture and elisa
two biopsy punches were terminally collected from each of the proximal middle and distal parts of individual colons using a  <dig> mm dermal punch biopsy instrument . each biopsy specimen was transferred into separate wells of a 48-well microtiter plate containing  <dig> μl of supplemented rpmi <dig> media  and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> hours in a cell culture incubator  <cit> . supernatants were collected and stored at -20°c until further use. interleukin1β  protein levels released by the biopsy samples in the media were assessed with a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit  , according to manufacturer's instruction, and the values were expressed as pg/ml .

macrophage cell culture assay
the mouse monocyte/macrophage cells, raw  <dig>  , were cultured and treated as previously described by dey et al.,  <cit> .

cell viability assay and dose range determination
a cell titer  <dig> mts assay kit  was used to determine the relative number of viable cells remaining after incubation with treatments. for actual in vitro experiments with peo, the highest non-toxic concentration or less was selected.

total rna extraction, purification, and cdna synthesis
total rna extraction, purification and cdna synthesis were performed as described previously in dey et al.,  <cit> .

real time quantitative pcr and gene array
q-rt-pcr was performed as previously described  <cit> . gene-specific primers  used in the current study are described in table  <dig>  for gene array experiments , pcr-arrays  were purchased and manufacturer's protocol was followed. relative quantification using sybr green technology and standard ΔΔct method was used for individual rt-pcr and gene array experiments. data are expressed as relative mrna quantity with respect to lps-elicited control  which is normalized to a value of  <dig>  as described in dey et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  .

il <dig>  interleukin6; cxcl10/ip <dig>  c-x-c motif ligand 10/ <dig> kda interferon-gamma-induced protein

immuno-blotting
for immunoblot analyses, pretreated raw  <dig>  cells were activated with lps for  <dig> minutes and harvested using ripa lysis buffer . for nuclear extract preparation and protein concentration determination manufacturer's  protocols in ne-per nuclear extraction reagents and pierce bca protein assay kit were followed. proteins  were separated by 12% sds-page and products were electrotransferred to polyvinyldene difluoride  membranes . the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk for  <dig> h, washed  <dig> times in pbs, incubated with primary ab  for  <dig> h, washed  <dig> times in pbst  and incubated with hrp-conjugated secondary ab  for  <dig> h, all at room temperature. after an additional  <dig> washing steps, bound peroxidase activity was detected by ecl detection system  .

statistical analysis
data are expressed as mean ± se. analyses for in vitro experiments were performed using student's t-test. one-way anova  was used to determine the significance of in vivo treatments followed by post-anova tukey's honestly significant difference multiple means comparison test to determine specificity of the treatments.

RESULTS
for convenient interpretation of the data discussed in the subsequent sections, the current paragraph highlights key features of the method section. the acute model is defined by rapid onset of severe clinical signs  that may be healed when the disease-causing agent  is withdrawn. the induction period in the acute model is shorter than in the chronic model and a higher dss concentration is used. in the chronic model, induction of symptoms is slower but longer lasting with possible flare-up and remission cycles. dss is administered in alternate cycles at lower concentrations for the chronic model . the optimal concentration of peo  for assessing its in vivo efficacy was determined in a pilot study using a dose response administration of peo in dss-treated animals . mesalamine/5-asa, a standard first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate uc, administered at a recommended  <dig> mg/kg  <cit> , was used as a reference standard for in vivo models. in all instances, statistical significances of treatments of peo and 5-asa groups were compared to dss group . the results are presented in the order of physiological, histopathological and molecular observations. in the sections to follow, the 'water-group' and the 'dss-group' refer to the healthy and the disease controls respectively .

disease activity index   combined the following  <dig> variables : change in body weight, stool consistency, occult blood in stool, rear end bleeding and inflammation , and rectal protrusion. dai was used to compare the treatment response to peo and 5-asa with that of the dss group following the scale described in table  <dig> . rectal prolapse, one of the variables for dai  was observed only in the chronic colitis animals  occurring with partial prolapse of the rectal lining. therefore, the dai shown for the acute model  does not reflect this variable. also, uc is an intermittent disease with periods of exacerbated symptoms and periods that are relatively symptoms free  <cit> . due to the longer experimental duration of the chronic model , the relapse-remission pattern among members of individual groups was observed . in the acute model, both peo and 5-asa attenuated the general signs of uc after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days of respective treatments  with peo performing notably better  and comparing closely with the water  group . in the chronic model, alleviation of clinical signs was not observed until after  <dig> days of treatment . the peo-treated group showed significant amelioration  of symptoms on day  <dig> and continued to experience further relief until the end of the experiment while the 5-asa group did not show any significant remission . in addition, the peo- treated group experienced an attenuated spike in symptoms starting from the second day of treatment , suggesting that peo may also prevent the relapsing nature of chronic colitis .

colon characteristics were analyzed next. colon lengths were measured prior to flushing. the healthy water group typically had longer, non-thickened colons. in the diseased animals, the colons were often shortened , likely due to loss in crypt structure and thickened due to edema formation, similar to previously reported studies with this model  <cit> . the differences between the healthy and the dss-receiving groups in terms of colon lengths were less pronounced in the acute study  as compared with the chronic study , likely due to shorter induction period . therefore, relief from colon shortening-effects was not observed in the acute model. in the chronic study, all of the dss-treated groups  had markedly shorter average colon lengths as compared with the healthy water-treated group . the peo-treated group exhibited pronounced attenuation of colon shortening  as was observed terminally.

histology of the bowel sections of the experimental animals revealed a number of cellular changes in the colons as described in table  <dig> <cit> . however, the population size available for histopathology study  was smaller  as compared to the observations for gross colon length  . this is because half of the  <dig> colons were used for biopsy samples  and half were available for histopathological evaluations. the peo-treated group had the lowest average pathological score , closely followed by the 5-asa group  . qualitative differences were widespread among the bowels of both the peo  and 5-asa  groups relative to the dss group . in the bowels of the dss treated animals, moderate to extensive infiltration of submucosa  and superficial muscularis  by a mixed population of inflammatory cells , such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages , was observed. in some samples the infiltration extended transmurally through the muscularis and into the serosa . the epithelium in small patches had frequently lost the majority of their goblet cells  or ulcerated away from mucosa with intense infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophylic leukocytes  beneath ulcerated areas, in contrast to the representative healthy colon section . rectal parts of the colons were generally characterized with the worst pathology including extensive infiltration, the presence of hyperplastic squamous epithelium and an increased mitotic index . in the bowels of peo- and 5-asa-treated groups  some signs of ulceration, partially inflamed submucosa, and low inflammatory cell infiltration were also observed, but to a much lesser extent and infrequently, in contrast to the dss group . additionally, crypt structures with intact goblet cells were frequently visible .

in order to address the biochemical basis of histological alterations, the cytokine response in the gut was evaluated by measuring the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 1β  from colon tissue. a significant reduction in the average production of il1β in the proximal  and distal  colon biopsies was observed among peo-treated animals as compared with the dss group. there was also a marked reduction in cytokine production in the mid colon for the peo group  . the average il1β production was reduced by 5-asa in the middle and distal colons.

in the present study, histopathological analyses showed infiltration by various inflammatory cells including macrophages in the diseased samples and a reduction of such infiltration in the peo treated group. subsequently, we performed a gene array analysis  using the same in vitro macrophage based system to elucidate additional immune signaling genes that could be potential targets of peo activity. twenty one out of  <dig> genes  induced by lps, were suppressed three-fold or more by  <dig> μm peo as compared to lps activation alone . lps is a known agonist of toll-like receptor  <dig> signaling that plays a critical role in colitis  <cit> . two genes that were down-regulated by lps and up-regulated by peitc were htr2b  and zap <dig> . lps activation  was separately compared to non activated levels of gene expressions . the  <dig> down regulated genes represent key transcription factors and inflammatory mediators, at least  <dig> of which including il <dig> were previously unknown to be affected by peitc/peo treatment . there is one very recent report  <cit> , however, showing in vitro down regulation of some oncogenes by peitc in response to il <dig> elicitation but effects of peitc on il <dig> expression was not reported. out of these  <dig> responding genes, concentration-dependent changes in il <dig>  cxcl <dig> and stat <dig>  expressions have been confirmed using real time rt-pcr  and western blot analyses respectively . these three genes were selected for further examination since their activation has been reported for human ulcerative colitis  <cit> . at 10- <dig> μm, a decrease in mrna and protein levels was observed for all these three genes  .

gene name
* novel hits  suppressed by peitc/peo 

il- <dig> signaling is mediated by stat <dig> and various inflammatory diseases including uc are associated with stat <dig> activation  <cit> . but since activity of peitc on stat <dig> activation is known  <cit> , our subsequent investigation focused on effects of peo on stat <dig> activation and expression. concentration dependent suppression of cytoplasmic stat <dig> protein  and mrna  levels were observed. additionally, cxcl <dig>  a stat <dig> responsive gene  <cit>  was also suppressed by peo in activated macrophages . we previously reported suppression of another stat <dig> responsive gene, inos by peo  <cit> . therefore, we wanted to study the effects of peo on activated  stat <dig> . since within seconds after phosphorylation stat <dig> translocates into the nucleus for binding to the dna of its target genes  <cit> , we determined the levels of pstat <dig> in the nuclear fractions of the peo treated cells. a concentration dependent attenuation of pstat <dig> was observed . densitometric analysis revealed a  <dig> -, 4-, and 5-fold  reduction in pstat levels by one,  <dig> and  <dig> μm peo. at  <dig> μm peo treatment, pstat was almost absent  as was also observed in non-stimulated cells .

discussion
barbarea verna seeds are a rich source of peitc with the potential for providing natural protection from environmental and dietary toxins  <cit> . we have previously reported the anti-inflammatory properties of peo  <cit> . peo, an essential oil extracted from edible b. verna, containing >95% naturally occurring peitc, was used for all experiments in the present study. here, we present the effects of peo in mouse ulcerative colitis models. the colitis was chemically induced with dss and clinical signs comparable to those of human ulcerative colitis  <cit>  were observed such as body weight loss, diarrhea, bloody stool, mucosal ulceration, and shortening of colon length  <cit> . dss is directly toxic to the gut epithelial cells by weakening the integrity of the mucosal barrier  <cit> . when given at a higher concentration  for a short duration , dss induced acute colitis, while long-term  and cyclic  administration of a lower concentration  of dss developed signs of chronic colitis . after disease induction,  <dig> mg/kg peo was administered orally, once daily for two weeks. the peo treatments significantly suppressed dss-induced colitis in acute as well as chronic models, improving their body weights and stool consistency, as well as decreasing their intestinal bleeding . in addition, peo reduced mucosal inflammation, depletion of goblet cells, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, thereby preserving colon length and structure . the observed attenuation of histopathological signs of colitis  was not as pronounced as the remission of the physiological symptoms  after  <dig> weeks of peo-treatment. this is, however, consistent with the published report that complete healing of bowel ulceration may not always occur in parallel with clinical remission of symptoms  <cit> . various clinical studies also suggest that mucosal restitution is usually measured after  <dig> weeks of treatments  <cit> . the effects of the reference drug 5-asa  administered at a dose of  <dig> mg/kg  <cit> , produced comparable dai to that of peo in the acute model  but were less pronounced in the chronic model . it is interesting to note that although widely used as a first-line therapy for uc, 5-asa is largely ineffective in more severe and chronic cases of the disorder  <cit> . for this reason and others, in recent years, the 5-aminosalicylic acid-containing pro-drug balsalazide has been the focus of attention. in a very recent metanalyses study balsalazide was more effective than mesalamine in induction of remission, but balsalazide had no benefit compared with mesalamine in preventing relapse in the population selected. the number of patients with any adverse events and withdrawals because of severe adverse events was similar for mesalamine and balsalazide  <cit> .

the pathophysiology of ibd is reflected by a distorted balance of regulatory cytokines  <cit> . we have previously reported the in vitro inhibition of il1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in immune cells by peo  <cit> . in colitis tissue, the expression of il1β increases in immune-challenged cells due to the activation of nuclear factor kappab   <cit> . also, local high production of il-1β leads to tissue damage in ibd patients  <cit> . in the present study we observed a significant peo-mediated reduction of il1β protein in the gut tissue .

the nfκb and stats are two important families of transcription factors that are activated in response to a variety of stimuli to regulate multiple cellular processes including immune response. the nfκb and stats have distinct as well as synergistic effects on gene induction  <cit> . stat proteins  are dormant cytoplasmic transcription factors that become activated after phosphorylation by janus kinases or other kinases in response to various stimuli including cytokines, growth factors and lps  <cit> . the activated protein migrates into the nucleus and binds to specific promoter elements to regulate gene expression  <cit> . stat regulated genes include inducible nitric oxide synthase   <cit> , and cxcl <dig>  <cit>  among others. the role of nfκb in ibd  <cit>  as well as effect of peitc on nfκb activity  <cit>  are well studied. excepting a very recent report on stat <dig>  <cit> , the effect of peitc on stats however has not been investigated.

an increase in stat <dig> expression and activation in human uc was observed by schreiber et al.,  <cit> . in addition, a number of studies have also reported an increased expression of cxcl <dig> in the serum and mucosa of patients with uc  <cit> . the cxcl <dig> is a stat <dig> responsive, cxc chemokine that promotes the migration of activated t cells. it is secreted by a variety of cell types, including macrophages  <cit> . the gene array analysis in the present study detected greater than three-fold suppression of stat <dig> and cxcl <dig> mrna by  <dig> μm peo in lps activated mouse macrophages . since it was previously unknown that peitc/peo can attenuate the expression of these genes , we further confirmed a concentration-dependent suppression of expression of these two genes by peo .

in macrophages we also observed a novel dose-dependent decrease of activated stat <dig>  in the nucleus by peo/peitc . this is an interesting observation given that macrophages are cells of monocytic lineage, and phosphorylated  stat <dig> was mainly detected in monocytic cells and neutrophils in the inflamed mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients  <cit> . the inhibition of pstat <dig> by peo is also consistent with our current and previous findings that cxcl <dig> and inos  <cit>  mrna are down regulated by peo in activated macrophages. since stat <dig> regulates inos  <cit>  and cxcl <dig>  <cit> , suppression of pstat <dig> by peo likely contributes to the downstream inhibition of inos and cxcl <dig>  based on our current observations we hypothesize that the decrease in nuclear pstat <dig> is primarily due to lower levels cytoplasmic stat <dig> protein  that serves as the kinase substrate before translocation. we have initiated a detailed investigation into the molecular mechanism of suppression of stat <dig> activation by peo that will be described elsewhere in the future.

published reports suggest the important role of il- <dig> signaling in the development of ibd  <cit> . il <dig> signaling is mediated by stat <dig> that is also associated with colitis disease development  <cit> . peitc has been shown to suppress stat <dig> activation  <cit>  but its direct effect on il <dig> expression has not been reported. the gene array data in the current study show down-regulation of this proinflammatory cytokine by peo in elicited macrophages . we confirmed this observation using a concentration-dependent mrna inhibition of il <dig> by peo .

in summary, orally administered peo is pharmacologically active at remitting acute and chronic bowel inflammation in experimental colitis in a mammalian model system. the biological activity of peo may be partly mediated by the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by infiltrating immune cells in the inflamed gut such as macrophages, thereby attenuating signs of tissue damage. the gene expression data further indicate that peo affects an intricate network of cellular targets of ibd including but not limited to stat <dig> mediated signaling. taken together, the physiological, histopathological and molecular findings of this study suggest that peo might provide promising new therapeutic lead for the treatment of ibd.

CONCLUSIONS
orally administered peo is pharmacologically active at remitting acute and chronic bowel inflammation in experimental colitis in a mammalian system. the physiological, histopathological and molecular findings of this study suggest that peo might provide promising new therapeutic lead for the treatment of ibd.
