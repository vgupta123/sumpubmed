BACKGROUND
double-flowered plants are often preferred by consumers because they are larger, more floriferous, and more showy than single flowers  <cit> . double-flowered varieties are more common than single-floweredvarieties for several important floricultural plants including carnation , rose , and chrysanthemum . in other floricultural plants, the development of double-flowered varieties is one of the main breeding aims alongside improvements to floral color, size, scent, vase life, and disease resistance.

generally, the flowers of dicotyledonous plants are composed of four types of organs; sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, which are arranged in four whorls. in eudicots, floral organ identities are explained by the abc model, which has been established from studies on two model plants, arabidopsis thaliana and antirrhinum majus  <cit> . the abc model includes many genes encoding mads-box transcription factors. according to this model, there are three classes of gene functions. the a-function gene, apetala <dig>  in a. majus), is expressed in the first and second whorls. the b-function genes, apetala <dig>  in a. majus) and pistillata  in a. majus) are expressed in the second and third whorls, and their encoded proteins gain their b-function when they form heterodimers  <cit> . the c-function genes are expressed in the third and fourth whorls, and play an important role in stamen and pistil formation. male and female organ identities are specified by a single c-function gene, agamous , in arabidopsis, but by two c-function genes, plena  and farinelli , in a. majus  <cit> . the a. majus ple mutant was shown to form petal and petaloid organs in place of stamens and carpels, respectively  <cit> , similar to the arabidopsis ag- <dig> mutant. a. majus ple is an ortholog of arabidopsis shatterproof 1/ <dig> , which is involved in the dehiscence of mature fruit  <cit> , but it is not an ortholog of ag. ag/far and shp/ple are paralogs, but not orthologs derived from a duplication event in a common ancestor  <cit> .

to control floral organ identity, the b- and c-function genes also require sepallata , which is defined as an e-function gene  <cit> . the proposed “quartet model” directly links floral organ identity to the action of four different tetrameric transcription factor complexes composed of mads-box proteins  <cit> . petunia fbp <dig> and fbp <dig> are expressed in the ovule, and are defined as d-class mads-box genes  <cit> . recently, the petunia c- and d-clade genes were shown to have largely overlapping functions specifying ovule identity and floral termination  <cit> . d-function genes have also been identified in lily , eustoma grandiflorum , and arabidopsis .

the deficiency of c-function genes results in the conversion of third-whorl stamens to petals, and fourth-whorl pistils to sepals  <cit> . this sepal-petal-petal pattern repeats itself many times, resulting in flowers with many petals. in addition to its role in determining floral organ identity, ag also plays a role in terminating flower development  <cit> . double-flowered phenotypes result from c-function deficiency in most floricultural plants, including ipomoea nil  <cit> , rosa hybrida  <cit> , petunia hybrida  <cit> , cyclamen persicum  <cit> , and cymbidium ensifolium  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that double-flowers of japanese gentian plants result from lost or impaired c-function gene , although this had not been confirmed experimentally.

japanese gentian  is one of the most popular floricultural plants in japan, and is used as cut flowers and potted plants  <cit> . the genus gentiana comprises more than  <dig> species, and belongs to the family gentianaceae, which also contains the genera eustoma, swertia, and tripterospermum. the flowers of japanese gentian have a bell-shaped corolla with five lobes, five stamens partly fused with petals, and one pistil. organs known as plicae, which are located between the lobes of the corolla, are a typical feature of the gentiana genus. the petals of japanese gentians are vivid blue, which is conferred by the polyacylated anthocyanin gentiodelphin  <cit> . the flavonoids of japanese gentian, the structures of the anthocyanins and flavones, and the biosynthetic structural and regulatory genes associated with these pigments have been well studied  <cit> . more recently, we determined the structures of flavones that accumulate in the leaves and flowers of g. triflora and identified a novel glucosyltransferase gene involved in the formation of flavone-glucosides  <cit> .

however, there have been few studies on the floral morphogenesis in japanese gentian at the molecular level. floral homeotic mads-box genes have been isolated and characterized from e. grandiflorum, which belongs to the family gentianaceae  <cit> . although mishiba et al.  <cit>  isolated four mads-box genes from g. triflora , these genes have not been characterized in detail. to date, there have been no systematic characterizations of floral morphological mads-box genes in japanese gentian.

here, we attempted to characterize a double-flowered mutant of g. scabra, a species closely related to g. triflora. we isolated and characterized mads-box genes expressed in gentian flower buds, focusing on c-class mads-box genes. we identified  <dig> mads-box genes belonging to a, b, c, d, and e classes; these genes are presumably involved in floral development and organ identification. analyses of a double-flowered mutant revealed that the phenotype was caused by an insertion of a novel retrotransposable element  into one of the c-function genes, gsag <dig>  this was confirmed by suppressing gsag <dig> using the apple latent spherical virus  vector. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the functional characterization of mads-box genes involved in the floral morphogenesis of japanese gentian, and the involvement of a retrotransposable element in its double-flowered phenotype.

RESULTS
isolation of mads-box genes from japanese gentian
the fragments of japanese gentian mads-box genes were amplified using degenerate primers designed from the conserved domain of agamous proteins, as described by kramer et al.  <cit> . after subcloning,  <dig> clones were sequenced, and  <dig> independent clones were identified. using 5′-race technology, we obtained eight independent clones of complete full-length cdna sequences, whereas the 5′-upstream fragments corresponding to the other six clones were not obtained. in a phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences, these japanese gentian mads-box genes clustered into four functional clades .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of c/d-class mads-box proteins. phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using clustalw and visualized using mega <dig>  genbank accession numbers of amino acid sequences used in phylogenetic analysis are as follows: arabidopsis thaliana ag , shp <dig> , shp <dig>  and stk ; antirrhinum majus far  and ple ; aquilegia alpina ag <dig> and ag <dig> ; cucumis sativus cum <dig>  and cum <dig> ; gentiana scabra gsag <dig> and gsag <dig> ; gerbera hybrida gaga <dig>  and gaga <dig> ; gossypium hirsutum mads <dig> , mads <dig>  and mads <dig> ; ipomoea nil dp  and peony ; lilium longiflorum mads <dig>  and mads <dig> ; oncidium hybrida mads <dig>  and mads <dig> ; petunia hybrida fbp <dig> , fbp <dig> , pfg  and pmads <dig> ; rosa rugosa masako c <dig>  and madsko d <dig> ; thalictrum dioicum thdag <dig>  and thdag <dig> ; zea mays zag <dig>  and zmm <dig> . numerals beside branches indicate bootstrap values from  <dig>  replicates. scale bar indicates  <dig>  amino acid substitutions per site



there were two gentian a-clade mads-box genes; gsap <dig>  and gsful . core eudicot species have two types of a-class mads-box lineage genes, euap <dig> and euful  <cit> . gsap <dig> and gsful were categorized into euap <dig> and euful, respectively . the deduced amino acid sequence of gsap <dig> showed  <dig>  % identity with that of gsful.

we also identified another six mads-box genes, which were categorized as b-class genes . the b-class mads-box genes form three subgroups, euap3/def, tm <dig> , and pi/glo  <cit> . gsap3a  and gsap3b  were categorized into the ap3/def subgroup, while gspi <dig> , gspi <dig> , and gspi <dig>  were categorized into the pi/glo subgroup. gstm <dig>  belonged to the tm <dig> subgroup derived from the ap3/def subgroup. the deduced amino acid sequence of gsap3a exhibited  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % identities with those of gsap3b and gstm <dig>  respectively. the deduced amino acid sequence of gsap3b showed  <dig>  % identity with that of gstm <dig>  gsap3a exhibited  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % identities, while gsap3b exhibited  <dig>  %,  <dig> % and  <dig>  % with arabidopsis ap <dig>  antirrhinum def, and petunia gp, respectively. gstm <dig> exhibited  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % identities with tomato tdr <dig>  petunia tm <dig>  and rose madsko b <dig>  respectively. gspi <dig> exhibited  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % identity with gspi <dig> and gspi <dig>  respectively, while gspi <dig> showed  <dig>  % identity with gspi <dig>  the gspis exhibited  <dig>  %– <dig>  %,  <dig>  %– <dig>  %,  <dig>  %– <dig>  %, and  <dig>  %– <dig>  % identities with arabidopsis pi, antirrhinum glo, petunia pmads <dig>  and petunia glo <dig>  respectively.

the c-clade mads-box genes can be separated into two subgroups, ag/far and shp/ple  <cit> . we isolated two arabidopsis ag/shp orthologs, gsag <dig>  and gsag <dig> , from japanese gentian floral buds, and both belonged to the shp/ple subgroup . no clones in the ag/far subgroup were obtained by degenerate pcr or by searching the gentian flower normalized library described by nakatsuka et al.  <cit> . the deduced amino acid sequence of gsag <dig> showed  <dig>  % identity with that of gsag <dig>  gsag <dig> showed  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % amino acid sequence identity with petunia fbp <dig>  <cit> , a. majus plena  <cit> , and i. nil peony  <cit> , respectively, whereas gsag <dig> showed  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % identity, respectively.

gsstk <dig>  showed high sequence similarity to stk , which is encoded by a d-class mads-box gene in arabidopsis and regulates ovule development  <cit> . the deduced amino acid sequence of gsstk <dig> showed  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % identity with that of eustoma grandiflorum mads <dig>  <cit> , petunia fbp <dig>  <cit>  and arabidopsis stk  <cit> , respectively. we also isolated three sep orthologs, designated as gssep <dig> , gssep <dig> , and gssep <dig> , all of which were e-function mads-box genes .

 the a-function genes included ap1-like mads-box genes, and also ap2-like genes harboring two continuous ap <dig> domains. we isolated a gsap <dig> ortholog  from the gentian petal normalized library described by nakatsuka et al.  <cit> . the gsap <dig> cdna was  <dig> -bp long, and encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acid residues . the mir172-target nucleotide sequences of ap <dig> were conserved within the gsap <dig> coding regions.

spatial expression analysis of mads-box genes in different floral organ, leaves, and stems
the spatial expression patterns of isolated mads-box genes were analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr in wild-type japanese gentian . among the a-clade mads-box genes, gsap <dig> expression was restricted to the first and second whorls and stem tissues, while gsful transcripts were detected in all of the tissues tested. gsful was strongly expressed in the first and second floral whorls and also in stem tissues.fig.  <dig> spatial expression profiles of mads-box genes in floral organs of japanese gentian. semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis was performed using total rnas isolated from sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils of floral buds, and from leaves and stems. expression profiles of  <dig> mads-box genes were investigated: a-clade , b-clade , c-clade , d-clade , and e-clade  genes. actin served as the reference gene. gene names and cycle numbers are indicated at the left and right of panel, respectively



the expressions of gsap3a, gsap3b, and gstm <dig>  belonging to the ap3/def subfamily, were detected in all four whorls of the floral organs. there were high transcript levels of gsap3a and gsap3b in the petal and stamen, and high transcript levels of gstm <dig> in the pistil organs in addition to whorls  <dig> and  <dig>  transcripts of gsap3a, gsap3b, and gstm <dig> were detected in stem organs, but barely detected in leaves. in contrast to the ap3/def subfamily, the pi/glo subfamily genes gspi <dig>  gspi <dig> and gspi <dig> were expressed only in the petal and stamen organs . the transcript levels of gspi <dig> and gspi <dig> were approximately equal in the petal and stamen organs, whereas there were higher transcript levels of gspi <dig> in the petal than in the stamen. the three gspi genes were expressed at undetectable levels in vegetative organs. thus, the expression profiles of the gspi genes belonging to pi/glo subgroup differed from those of the genes in the ap3/def and tm <dig> subgroups.

the two c-class mads-box genes, gsag <dig> and gsag <dig>  were strongly expressed in the third  and fourth whorls . transcripts of gsag <dig> were also present in petals. transcripts of both gsag <dig> and gsag <dig> were at very low levels or undetected in vegetative tissues . transcripts of gsstk <dig> were detected only in pistils, and not in other whorls, leaves, or stems. the three e-class mads-box genes, gssep <dig>  gssep <dig>  and gssep <dig>  showed similar expression profiles in floral organs. transcripts of gssep <dig> and gssep <dig> were detected all floral whorls but not in leaves or stems, whereas gsspe <dig> transcripts were detected in all floral whorls and in stems.

heterologous expressions of gsag <dig> and gsag <dig> in arabidopsis
to investigate the functions of gsag <dig> and gsag <dig>  we produced four and six lines of t <dig> transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing gsag <dig> or gsag <dig>  respectively. ectopic expressions of c-class mads-box genes in arabidopsis and tobacco have been used to evaluate the function of ag orthologs from several plants  <cit> . ectopic expressions of ag genes have been shown to induce the ap <dig> mutant phenotype; that is, pistil-stamen-stamen-pistil  <cit>  of the four gsag1-overexpressing arabidopsis lines, three formed carpeloid organs instead of sepals, and showed partial disappearance of petals . no morphological changes were observed in all six gsag2-overexpressing arabidopsis lines . these results revealed that the biological functional ortholog of arabidopsis ag was gsag <dig>  not gsag <dig> fig.  <dig> typical floral phenotypes of gsag1- and gsag2-expressing transgenic arabidopsis plants. a vector-control flower with normal sepal and petal organs. b–d flowers of gsag1-overexpressing transgenic lines nos.  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with sepals and petals converted into pistiloid and stamenoid organs, respectively. e–f flowers of gsag2-overexpressing transgenic lines nos.  <dig> and  <dig> with normal floral phenotypes. expression of transgene in each t <dig> transgenic plant is illustrated in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  bar =  <dig> mm



expression analysis of mads-box genes in a double-flowered mutant
next, we attempted to identify the cause of double-flowers in a gentian mutant. the double-flowered mutant had petaloid organs instead of stamens in the third whorl . the petaloid organ consisted of a petal structure fused to a sterile stamen. some individuals of the double-flowered mutant also formed a slightly abnormal pistil that contained another incomplete pistil.fig.  <dig> phenotype of double-flowered gentian mutant and spatial expression analysis of mads-box genes. a typical floral phenotypes of single flower cv. alta  and double-flowered mutant . bar =  <dig> cm. b qrt-pcr analysis of floral mads-box genes in single-flowered cultivar  and double-flowered mutant. total rnas were isolated from each whorl organ of floral buds at flower developmental stage  <dig> as defined by nakatsuka et al.  <cit> . values are the average of four biological replicates ± standard deviation. white bar indicates single-flowered gentian cv. alta. black bar indicates double-flowered mutant. ** and nd indicate significant difference  and no significant difference, respectively 



to identify the candidate gene responsible for the formation of double flowers, we compared the spatial expression profiles of c-class mads-box genes between the double-flowered mutant and the typical single-flowered gentian cv. alta . the transcript levels of gsag <dig> in the third and fourth whorls were significantly lower in the double-flowered mutant than in the single-flowered cultivar. in contrast, the abundance of gsag <dig> transcripts was not significantly different between the wild-type cultivar and the double-flowered mutant. the transcript levels of gsap <dig> in the inner two whorls were higher in the double-flowered mutant than in the wild-type plants . there were also differences between the wild-type cultivar and the double-flowered mutant in the transcription profiles of other a-class gsap <dig> and gsful genes in the second and third whorls. slight differences in the expression patterns of some genes might be because of the different genetic backgrounds of the single-flowered cultivar and the double-flowered mutant. however, these results suggested that gsag <dig>  a c-class mads-box gene, was the most likely candidate gene responsible for the double-flowered phenotype.

genomic structures of gsag <dig> and gsag <dig> in japanese gentian
in spatial expression analyses of japanese gentian mads-box genes, reduced gsag <dig> transcript levels were detected in male and female organs of the double-flowered mutant . therefore, we determined the genomic sequences of gsag <dig> and gsag <dig> in the double-flowered mutant and control plants.

the genome sequence corresponding to gsag <dig> cdna was  <dig> -kb long, and consisted of nine exons and eight introns . the number and position of introns were conserved between arabidopsis ag and gsag <dig>  the second and third introns of gsag <dig>  were considerably longer than those of the corresponding introns in ag genes in other plants . the genomic sequence of gsag <dig> was  <dig> -kb long and consisted of nine exons and eight introns, like gsag <dig> . the second intron of gsag <dig> was  <dig> -kb long, but the third intron was shorter than that of gsag <dig>  the second intron of arabidopsis ag contains transcriptional regulation regions  <cit> . the second intron region of both gsag <dig> and gsag <dig> had several cis-elements; a carg box , a lfy binding site  and a 70-bp region  .fig.  <dig> genomic structures of gsag <dig> and gsag <dig>

genomic structures of gsag <dig> and gsag <dig> in the double-flowered mutant
 next, we compared the genomic structures of gsag <dig> and gsag <dig> between the wild-type cultivar and the double-flowered mutant. genomic pcr analyses targeting the sixth intron region of gsag <dig> amplified a fragment from wild type, but not from the double-flowered mutant . therefore, we sequenced the sixth intron of gsag <dig> in the double-flowered mutant using genome walking technology. the sixth intron of gsag <dig> in the double-flowered mutant had a  <dig> -bp insertion that was not present in wild type. this inserted sequence had typical features of an ltr-retrotransposon, including a 5-bp target site duplication  and a 334-bp perfectly matching long terminal repeat  at both ends . the insert was designated as tgs <dig> . tgs <dig> encoded a  <dig> -amino acid sequence of a gag-pol polyprotein belonging to the ty3/gypsy-type retrotransposon group. there was no difference in the genomic structure of gsag <dig> between the double-flowered mutant and the wild-type cultivar .

suppression of gsag <dig> by virus-induced gene silencing
 to confirm whether the deficiency of the gsag <dig> gene contributed to the double-flowered phenotype in japanese gentian, we attempted to suppress the expression of gsag <dig> using vigs. we used apple latent spherical virus  vectors because they have been used for reliable and effective vigs in a broad range of plants  <cit> .

gold particles coated with pealsr <dig> and pealsr2l5r <dig> were bombarded into in vitro-grown plants of transgenic japanese gentian overexpressing atft  <cit> . one month after the bombardment, the proliferation of alsv in inoculated plants was confirmed by rt-pcr analysis. the proliferation of alsv was detected in almost all plantlets , confirming that the direct bombardment of plasmid vectors was suitable to inoculate alsv into gentian.

 twenty-two and  <dig> atft-overexpressing gentian plants were inoculated with either an empty alsv vector  or the alsv-gsag <dig> vector , respectively. rt-pcr analysis confirmed that the biolistic inoculation of alsv vectors resulted in a  <dig> % inoculation frequency . the gentian plants inoculated with alsv vectors were acclimated in a closed greenhouse, and set flowers after 1– <dig> months of acclimation. there was no significant difference in flower phenotype between wild type and plants inoculated with an empty alsv vector . six out of  <dig> surviving plants inoculated with alsv-gsag <dig> formed petals in place of stamens . the qrt-pcr analysis showed that plants showing the conversion phenotype by infection with alsv-gsag <dig> had significantly suppressed gsag <dig> transcript levels, compared with those in plants inoculated with the empty vector . the transcript levels of gsag <dig> were not affected by alsv-gsag <dig> infection. there was no significant morphological change in the pistils of alsv-gsag1-inoculated plants.fig.  <dig> effects of gsag <dig> suppression by vigs. typical flower phenotypes of control alsv-empty  and alsv-ag <dig> -infected plants . spatial expression patterns of gsag <dig>  and gsag <dig>  in alsv-empty and alsv-gsag1-infected plants. flowers from three independent plants were examined for each treatment. values are mean ± standard deviation . ** and nd indicate significant difference  and no significant difference, respectively 



discussion
in this study, we isolated  <dig> mads-box genes expressed in floral buds of g. scabra: two a-class genes , six b-class genes , two c-class genes , one d-class genes , and three e-class genes  . mishiba et al.  <cit>  cloned four mads-box genes, gtmads1–gsmads <dig>  from g. triflora, a closely related species of g. scabra. our analyses confirmed that gtmads1–gtmads <dig> are orthologs of gsful, gsag <dig>  gsag <dig>  and gssep <dig>  respectively.

in arabidopsis, ap <dig> and ful function independently; the former controls sepal and petal identities, and the latter controls fruit development and determinacy  <cit> . in other core eudicots, plants with defective ap <dig> genes formed leaf-like sepals, but their petal identity was unaffected  <cit> . therefore, euful genes play an early role in promoting the transition to reproductive meristems and a late role in fruit development. in japanese gentian, gsap <dig> expression was restricted to the first and second whorls of the floral bud and stem, and it was expressed strongly in the sepals and stems . conversely, gsful was expressed in all tested organs, and was strongly expressed in petals and stems . as well as gsap <dig> and ful, gsap <dig> might also act as an a-function gene . gsap <dig> was strongly expressed in the second whorl . in arabidopsis, the expression of ap <dig> is regulated by mir <dig> through translational inhibition  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence of gsap <dig> contained a conserved mir <dig> target sequence . therefore, the whorl-specific expression of gsap <dig> might be controlled by mir <dig> in gentian, like in other plants.

in arabidopsis and a. majus, b-function, which specifies petal and stamen identities, is determined by a heterodimer consisting of one ap3/def protein and one pi/glo protein  <cit> . ap3/def lineages can be categorized into two subgroups; euap <dig> and paleoap <dig>  <cit> . euap <dig> is widely distributed in higher eudicots, whereas paleoap <dig> is distributed in lower eudicots, magnoliid dicots, monocots, and basal angiosperms  <cit> . in addition, a number of higher eudicot species contain both euap <dig> and paleoap <dig> . ap3/def genes belonging to the euap <dig>  and tm <dig>  groups were isolated from japanese gentian . three euap <dig>  one tm <dig>  and two pi/glo genes were also identified from eustoma grandiflorum in the family gentianaceae  <cit> . therefore, it seems that a tm <dig> gene encoding a b-class mads-box protein is present in the family gentianaceae, but not in the solanaceae  <cit>  or asteraceae  <cit> . geuten and irish  <cit>  reported that the pi/glo lineage was duplicated and separated into glo <dig> and glo <dig> lineages in the solanaceae. their results also implied that the glo <dig> lineage has been lost from the gentianales and the glo <dig> lineage lost from the lamiales. the results of the present study indicated gspi <dig> to gspi <dig> in japanese gentian are in the glo <dig> lineage . gsap3a, gsap3b, and gstm <dig> were expressed in all floral whorls . high transcript levels of gsap3a and gsap3b were detected in the second  and third whorls , and gstm <dig> was expressed at high levels in whorls 2– <dig>  on the other hand, the expressions of the three gspis were clearly restricted to the second and third whorls . these differences in expression profiles among euap <dig>  tm <dig>  and pi/glo were also reported in petunia  <cit> . in petunia, phtm <dig> is mainly expressed in third and fourth whorls and is involved in stamen development but not petal development, while phdef is involved in both petal and stamen development  <cit> .

both gsag <dig> and gsag <dig> were categorized into the shp/ple subgroup but not the ag/far subfamily . in this study, we could not find any paralogous genes belonging to the ag/far subgroup by degenerate pcr technology. in e. grandiflorum, which also belongs to the family gentianaceae, three shp/ple subgroup genes  were identified, but no ag/far subgroup genes  <cit> . the ag/far subgroup of c-class mads-box genes is responsible for male and female organ identity in several plant species. this subgroup of genes includes arabidopsis ag  <cit> , petunia pmads <dig>  <cit> , and i. nil duplicated . members of the shp/ple subgroup also play a major role in floral organ identity in a. majus  <cit> . therefore, ag/far subgroup genes might have disappeared from some species in the gentianaceae, leaving shp/ple subgroup genes to function as c-class genes, although further analysis such as whole-genome sequencing should be conducted to confirm this hypothesis.

there is only one c-class mads-box gene, a single copy of ag, in arabidopsis. however, there are two ag paralogs in some plant species, including a. majus , petunia , cucumber , maize , i. nil , and cyclamen . in maize, zag <dig> transcripts accumulate in developing ears rather than in tassels, whereas zmm <dig> transcripts are more abundant in tassels  <cit> . in the ple single mutant of a. majus, the fourth whorl develops as two sepaloid/carpeloid/petaloid organs. the fourth whorl organs of ple/far double mutants develop as four or five well-formed petals  <cit> . thus, ple and far appear to contribute unequally to the specification of male and female organs.

gsag <dig> transcripts were detected in the inner three whorls, whereas gsag <dig> transcripts were restricted to the third and fourth whorls . gsag <dig> transcripts were detected in petal organs  in the rt-pcr analysis  but not in the qrt-pcr analysis . the rt-pcr and qrt-pcr analyses were performed using floral buds at different floral development stages, s <dig>  and s <dig> , respectively. in general, ag is expressed in either the third or fourth whorls  <cit> . therefore, gsag <dig> expression in the second whorl in japanese gentian appears to be a unique phenomenon. this may be because the petals and stamens of japanese gentians are fused at their lower halves. therefore, at an early floral developmental stage, young petal organs might contain stamen primordia. as shown in the qrt-pcr analysis , no gsag <dig> transcripts were detected in the second whorl because both petal and stamen organs were completely distinguishable at the later stage of floral development.

the heterologous expression of gsag <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis caused the conversion of sepals into carpeloid organs, indicating its ag function . in contrast, gsag2-expressing arabidopsis showed no significant changes in morphogenesis compared with the empty vector control . ectopic expressions of arabidopsis ag or antirrhinum ple specified homeotic conversion of the first and second whorl organs, causing sepals to develop as carpels and petals to develop as stamens  <cit> . the ectopic expression of antirrhinum far converted petals to stamens, but did not alter sepal identity  <cit> . thus, heterologous expression analyses in arabidopsis do not always correctly evaluate the function of c-class mads-box genes from other plant species.

most double-flowered phenotypes result from a deficiency of c-function genes  <cit> . the qrt-pcr analysis showed that gsag <dig> transcripts were markedly decreased in the third and fourth whorls of double-flowered japanese gentian, compared with those in single-flowered wild-type japanese gentian . no gsag <dig> transcripts were detected in the doubled-flower mutant by rt-pcr using several primer combinations , and no truncated gsag <dig> transcripts were detected by 3′-race. a sequencing analysis revealed that the double-flowered mutant had an insertion of a  <dig> -bp putative retrotransposable element in the sixth intron of gsag <dig> . this transposable element, tgs <dig>  had the typical features of ty3/gypsy-type retrotransposable elements . in the duplicated  mutant of i. nil, the mutation was due to the rearrangement of genomic structure by the em/spm transposable element  <cit> . the antirrhinum ple mutant was shown to have an insertion of the tam <dig> transposable element in the second intron of ple, and ple mrna was hardly detected in the floral organs of the mutant  <cit> . it was also reported that a double-flowered ranunculid mutant was associated with the insertion of a solo ltr retrotransposon into the fourth exon of thag <dig>  <cit> . thus, it is likely that the expression of gsag <dig> would be interrupted by the insertion of the long transposable element in the sixth intron.

vigs is a useful tool for the functional analysis of genes in horticultural plants that are recalcitrant to other means of genetic transformation  <cit> . petunia plants in which both pmads <dig> and fbp <dig> were silenced by vigs formed petaloid organs in place of carpels, depending on the cultivar  <cit> . most viral vectors are excluded from meristematic tissue, and therefore, gene silencing in the meristem is not possible in most instances  <cit> . in this study, we used vigs to silence gsag <dig> and observed that stamens were converted into petaloid organs . these results strongly suggested that the deficiency of gsag <dig> was responsible for the double-flowered phenotype of this mutant. enhanced transcript levels of gsap <dig> were detected in the third and fourth whorls of the double-flowered mutant . in contrast, the spatial expression profiles of gsap <dig> and gsful were similar between the single-flowered cultivar and double-flowered plants. mizukami and ma  <cit>  reported that ag antagonizes the function of ap <dig>  therefore, we speculated that gsag <dig> controls the whorl-specific expression of gsap <dig> 

in the double-flowered gentian mutant, the fourth-whorl pistil was not converted into petals, possibly because of the function of gsag <dig>  compared with single-flowered gentian, the double-flowered mutant showed increased expression of gsag <dig> in the third whorl . there were also increased transcript levels of gsag <dig> in double-flowered transgenic gentians in which gsag <dig> was suppressed by vigs . in antirrhinum, ple is required for full expression of far, whereas far negatively regulates the expression of ple  <cit> . it is possible that gsag <dig> negatively regulates the expression of gsag <dig> in the third whorl of japanese gentian. unfortunately, there are no gsag2-deficient mutants in nature; therefore, to show the function of the gsag <dig>  the suppression of gsag <dig> by vigs should be attempted in future studies. in cyclamen, cpag <dig> is involved in stamen formation, and the deficiency of cpag <dig> caused the homeotic conversion of stamens into petals, resulting in double-petal phenotypes  <cit> . overexpression of cpag2-srdx  in the cyclamen cpag <dig> mutant resulted in a multiple-petal phenotype, and the conversion of pistils into petals  <cit> . thus, two c-class mads orthologs contribute to male and female organ identity. noor et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that vigs suppression of both mads <dig> and fbp <dig> resulted in the conversion of the stamen/carpel into petal/petaloid organs, resulting in double flowers.

the current hypothesis is that gsag <dig> plays an important role in male organ identify, while gsag <dig> plays important roles in female organ identity and in terminating flowering. to confirm this hypothesis, gsag2- and gsag1/gsag2- knockdown or knockout lines of japanese gentian should be generated and analyzed in further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we investigated the causal factor  of a double-flowered mutant in japanese gentian. we isolated and characterized  <dig> mads-box genes and revealed that a novel retrotransposable element  inserted into the sixth intron of gsag <dig> gene is responsible for the mutant flower phenotype. this was confirmed by alsv-based vigs system in combination with arabidopsis ft-expressing early flowering transgenic gentian plants. further investigations will be required to fully understand the developmental regulation of floral morphogenesis in japanese gentian. as variation in floral shape is currently limited in japanese gentians, we believe that this information will be helpful for breeding gentian cultivars with variation in floral shape in the future.
