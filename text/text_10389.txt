BACKGROUND
peroxisome proliferators are structurally diverse chemicals that include industrial pollutants, plasticizers, herbicides, and lipid-lowering drugs. fibrates including bezafibrate, clofibrate, fenofibrate, wy- <dig> , and others are a unique class of hypolipidemic drugs. they function as agonists for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha . pparα is a transcriptional nuclear receptor and forms a heterodimer with another nuclear receptor, retinoid x receptor . pparα/rxr heterodimer binds effectively to the peroxisome proliferator response elements  located in promoters of various target genes and regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and peroxisome proliferation  <cit> . ppre consists of direct repeats of tga/tcct which is separated by a single nucleotide   <cit> . fibrates reduce plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels via the activation of pparα, which is considered to be the result of induction of fatty acid catabolism in the liver. at the molecular level, fibrates bind to pparα and increase the expression of genes that involved in fatty acid uptake , β-oxidation , and ω-oxidation   <cit> . this pharmacological effect of fibrates is responsible for the therapeutic utility, and this effect was observed in preclinical species and also in humans.

along with the pharmacological effects of fibrates, toxic effects such as marked peroxisome proliferation, hepatomegaly and hepatocarcinoma are observed in rodents  <cit> . it is accepted that the mode of action  is dependent upon sustained pparα activation. this mode of action is supported by the observation that even a one year exposure to pparα agonists was insufficient to cause an increase in the incidence of hepatic neoplasms in pparα knock-out mice. in addition, peroxisome proliferation and gene expression regulated by pparα were not remarkably altered. one hypothesis for the carcinogenic mechanism of action of pparα agonists in rodent liver is based on their ability to elevate peroxisomal β-oxidation and microsomal ω-oxidation of fatty acids, resulting in the generation of hydrogen peroxide. this excess production of hydrogen peroxide results in the generation of reactive oxygen species  and oxidative stress  <cit> . the induction of oxidative stress has been suggested as a common pathway for many non-genotoxic carcinogens to elicit their carcinogenicity  <cit> . in addition, increased peroxisome proliferation in response to activation by pparα agonists is associated with tumor formation in rodent liver  <cit> . the combined effect of increased oxidative stress and increased cell proliferation in the rodents exposed to pparα agonists likely underlies their carcinogenic potential. the precise mechanism of the hepatocarcinogenesis of pparα agonists in rodents is not fully understood. since a number of fibrates  are used as therapeutic agents, it is important to analyze the mechanism of liver toxic effects occurred in rodents so that we can better evaluate the safety of these drugs.

microarray technology provides a comprehensive, rapid and efficient method for large scale profiling of gene expression changes in biological samples . the advantages of dna microarray technology include the ability to analyze expression patterns of thousands of genes simultaneously. other advantages include the ability to characterize relationships between genes and the changes in biological processes such as disease states, developmental stages and responses to drugs  <cit> . this method has been successfully employed in identifying gene expression changes in cells, including both hepatic cell lines  <cit>  and isolated hepatocytes  <cit> , in response to various stimuli.

in this study, using mouse primary hepatocytes, we examined global gene expression profiles observed after treatment with several concentrations of three pparα agonists . the gene expression profiles showed increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and metabolism as expected, and also showed regulation of many genes involved in the production of ros and those that are associated with liver cancer development. this study also demonstrates the similarity of gene expression changes induced by three different pparα agonists. in addition, this whole genome microarray analysis performed following in vitro administration of pparα agonists indicates a plausible mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis in the mouse liver and may help with the safety assessment of this class of agents.

RESULTS
pparα agonist administration to primary hepatocytes to assess pparα activity
in order to estimate whether pparα activity was elevated by the addition of pparα agonists, phd luciferase plasmid containing three direct tandem copies of a ppre binding site was used as a reporter plasmid. primary hepatocytes were co-transfected with phd luc reporter plasmid and psg5-pparα or psg5-pparα/psg5-rxr expression vectors. twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with pparα agonist at various concentrations  for  <dig> h. basal level of luciferase activity was observed  when cells were transfected with phd luc reporter plasmid and pgs <dig> empty vector. this could be due to the activity of endogenous pparα agonists   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that mouse primary hepatocytes transfected with phd luc reporter plasmid and pgs <dig> empty vector produced  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold increased in luciferase activity after the treatment with  <dig> μm bezafibrate, fenofibrate, and wy- <dig> , respectively. when cells were treated with the same concentration of drugs in the presence of pparα expression plasmid, the induction of luciferase activities increased to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold. moreover, in the presence of both pparα and rxr expression plasmids, luciferase activities increased even further to  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold. pparα activation inductions by these three agonists demonstrate a does-dependent increase for  <dig> μm compare wtih  <dig> and  <dig> μm treatments .

gene expression patterns associated with exposures of pparα agonists
to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the pleiotropic effects of fibrates, mouse primary hepatocytes were treated with three pparα agonists . rna was isolated following  <dig> h treatment and the agilent whole mouse genome microarray analysis was performed. three replicate arrays corresponding to each treatment  of each drug  were compared to the control replicates  using student t-test. a gene was considered to be significantly regulated by a drug if the fold change was greater than  <dig>  and the p-value was less than  <dig> . based on these two criteria, there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes that showed an altered expression by the treatments with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm bezafibrate, respectively. there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes altered by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm fenofibrate, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes altered by the treatment with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm wy- <dig> . the venn diagrams  represent the numbers of differentially expressed genes  from three drug treatments at various concentrations. among these degs,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were altered in common by bezafibrate, fenofibrate and wy- <dig>  treatments across  <dig> doses, respectively . these commonly regulated genes showed clear dose-dependent changes . except for the down regulation of ahsg by wy- <dig> , all genes were identified as up-regulated. expression of pdk <dig> and cte <dig> showed a particularly prominent induction  by treatment of wy- <dig>  , as did fabp <dig> with 20– <dig> fold induction by  <dig> μm treatments of fenofibrate and wy- <dig>  .

hierarchical clustering analysis with degs revealed that these genes were grouped together based on treatment doses rather than on specific drugs , indicating that a class effect was detectable. taking into consideration the fact that most of the genes altered by low  and middle  dose treatments were also altered by high  dose treatments, further analysis was focused on the genes regulated by the high dose treatments. figure  <dig> represents the numbers of genes regulated by the  <dig> μm treatments of three drugs and the numbers of overlapping genes among three drug treatments. treatments with  <dig> μm of bezafibrate, fenofibrate and wy- <dig>  resulted in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes with altered expression, respectively. among them,  <dig> genes were concordantly regulated by three drugs and  <dig> genes were regulated commonly by at least  <dig> drugs. the correlation of log <dig> fold changes based on  <dig> genes which were regulated commonly by three drugs was determined by pairwise comparisons . comparison of gene expression profiles resulted in relatively high correlations  between three drug treatments, indicating that gene expression patterns are identical at the  <dig> μm concentration despite any differences among the drugs.

gene function analysis
using ingenuity pathway analysis, we conducted gene function analysis with these  <dig> commonly regulated genes. not surprisingly, the largest categories of induced genes were those involved in lipid metabolism , including oxidation, modification, and metabolism. table  <dig> shows the genes involved in oxidation , of which  <dig> were involved in β-oxidation. as expected, many genes directly regulated by pparα including cpt <dig> , fabp <dig> , acox <dig> , and ehhadh  were identified in this study. induction of these genes corroborates previous data, and also serves as the validation of our microarray experiments. several novel genes including acacb, acsl <dig>  ech <dig>  hadhb, and pdk <dig> that are involved in oxidation of lipid metabolism were responsive to the treatments of pparα agonists. in addition, four genes  associated with the production of ros exhibited  <dig> – <dig>  fold up-regulation, and two genes  involved in the cellular proliferation of peroxisomes were 3-fold up-regulated.

administration of fibrates to rodents results in hepatic diseases and hepatocarcinoma  <cit> . for gene function analysis, we also concentrated on genes involved in these effects. there were six genes related to hepatic disorders , and all were up-regulated by fibrate administration. four of these genes are involved in oxidation of lipids. in addition,  <dig> genes classified as being related to the development of liver cancer had altered expression levels. these include liver fatty acid binding protein  <dig> , lymphocyte antigen  <dig> complex locus d , monoglyceride lipase , and angiopoietin-like  <dig> , with a wide range of up-regulation  after treatments with these three pparα agonists.

discussion
fibrates, members of peroxisome proliferators and agonists of pparα, are used to treat hyperlipidemia by reducing plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels via accelerating lipid metabolism. in rodents, administration of fibrates can induce hepatomegaly and hepatocarcinoma, possibly due to the induction of cell proliferation and increased oxidative stress. examination of pparα-deficient mice demonstrated that the activation of pparα is required exclusively for mediating both pharmacological  and toxic  responses of fibrate administration  <cit> . however, mechanisms of fibrate-induced hepatocarcinoma development and the potential risk of use of these drugs to humans remain unclear. examination of gene expression profiles is an important approach that may help us better understand pparα-mediated pleiotropic effects.

in this study, microarray analysis was applied to generate a molecular portrait of gene expression in mouse primary hepatocytes exposed to fibrates . we treated mouse primary hepatocytes with three fibrates  at multiple doses . although global gene analysis study was conducted in vitro  <cit> , the design of this study  permitted us to detect whether changes in gene expressions are a class effect  and whether changes are dose-dependent as well. indeed, the majority of genes regulated by low and middle doses were also identified in high dose treatments. for example, 4/ <dig>  9/ <dig>  and 25/ <dig> genes that were regulated by  <dig> μm treatments of bezafibrate, fenofibrate and wy- <dig> , respectively, were also found to be regulated in  <dig> μm treatments . in addition, dose-response dependency in gene expressions was also observed for the genes commonly regulated at multiple doses . the dose-dependent expression levels of genes altered by pparα agonists allowed us to assess biological activity of this class of agents.

pparα agonists have a therapeutic role in the management of fatty acid metabolism through their effects on β-oxidation and lipid transport. the gene expression changes in common across pparα agonists may indicate those genes are directly regulated by pparα stimulation. in this study, we demonstrated that  <dig> degs were altered in common by at least two of the three pparα agonists tested. the ingenuity pathway analysis was used to analyze gene functions and to provide pathway annotations. based on this analysis, many of these genes  are involved in the oxidation of fatty acids  as has been previously shown for this class of agents  <cit> . for example, acyl-coa synthetase catalyzes the precursor step to β-oxidation  and three members of the long chain acyl coa synthestase family  were increased. this observation is supported by the work of schoonjans et al. who demonstrated that the expression of acs is altered by fibrates and that there is a ppre in the acsl promoter  <cit> . these findings also agree with those of cornwall et al. who reported that the expression of acsl was elevated in the liver of rats exposed to fenofibrate  <cit> . the effects on the β-oxidation pathway also include the induction of the first enzyme of peroxisomal β-oxidation, acyl-coa oxidase , as well as the next enzyme in the cascade, enoyl-coa hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase . the identification of a large number of lipid metabolizing genes following exposure to several pparα agonists is in concordance with the known biochemical and molecular effects of these hypolipidemic agents to regulate lipid metabolism.

pparα agonists are also considered to be nongenotoxic carcinogens in rodents. oxidative stress has been proposed as a common pathway for many non-genotoxic carcinogens  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation were up-regulated upon exposure to pparα agonists , which included acox, the key enzyme of peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation system. the elevation of peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation such as occurs with pparα agonist exposure in rodents results in the elevated generation of hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . substantial production of hydrogen peroxide causes oxidative stress and the induction of ros. the increased ros associated with elevated levels of acox has been postulated to mediate the hepatocarcinogenesis resulting from pparα exposure in rodents. we observed four genes  associated with the production of ros were up-regulated. a growing body of evidence indicates that cd <dig>  is involved in the cytotoxicity associated with inflammation and is an essential mediator of the production of ros  <cit> . in addition, six genes classified as related to hepatic disorders were identified as being up-regulated . these observations support the hypothesis that increased peroxisome proliferation results in oxidative stress, which may be due to the disproportionate increase in the level of oxidation versus antioxidation enzyme activities  <cit> .

it is believed that the activation of pparα and ensuing cascade effects are linked to both pharmacological and tumorigenic effects of pparα agnoists  <cit> . the carcinogenic response seems likely to be associated with both the induction of oxidative stress and the increased cell proliferation from peroxisome proliferation after treatment with these chemicals. in this study, we found that two genes  associated with cellular proliferation of peroxisomes were up-regulated about 3-fold. the level of peroxisomal biogenesis factor  <dig>  correlates roughly with peroxisome abundance in the cell, and over-expression of pex <dig> alone is sufficient to accelerate peroxisome division and to increase peroxisome abundance  <cit> . it is thought that alteration in the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis is causally related to the induction of liver tumors, and induced cell proliferation plays a key role in carcinogenesis in animals and humans  <cit> .

based on the ingenuity pathway analysis,  <dig> genes associated with liver cancer development were up-regulated by at least two pparα agonists tested . for example, bnip <dig> , a pro-apoptotic factors of the bcl-2-family, has been previously shown to be up-regulated in malignant tumors  <cit> . diazepam binding inhibitor , interacts with hepatocyte nuclear factor- <dig> α that transcriptionally regulates the genes involved in both lipid and glucose metabolism  <cit> , was also increased. previous studies indicated that dbi levels are higher in hepatocellular carcinoma  patients  <cit> , and the elevation of dbi expression is useful in evaluating malignancy and in diagnostic approaches of tumors in liver tissue  <cit> . fatty acid-binding proteins  are involved in lipid metabolism by intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids. liver fatty acid-binding protein  is demonstrated immunohistochemically in human hepatocellular malignancies, suggesting that its immunoreactivity is a candidate for the tumor marker in hepatic cell malignancies  <cit> . fatty acid synthase  is the key enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis. the over-expression of fasn is an early phenomenon presented in both hormonally and chemically induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis  <cit> . hypoxia inducible factor- <dig> alpha  regulates the expression of a myriad of genes involved in oxygen transport, glucose uptake, glycolysis and angiogenesis. the expression of hif1a in hcc tissue is higher than that in paraneoplastic tissue or normal liver tissue, and hif1a plays an important role in neovascularization in hcc  <cit> . lgals <dig>  has been demonstrated to be associated with assorted processes such as cell growth, tumor transformation and metastasis. it has been reported that lgals <dig> expression was induced in cirrhotic liver and hcc, and that the expression of lgals <dig> in proliferating cells possibly indicates an early neoplastic event  <cit> . the plasminogen activation system, including pai- <dig> , plays a crucial role in the process of cancer. pai- <dig> is increased in hcc, and its expression is related to the invasiveness, metastasis, and prognosis  <cit> . our findings support the observation that pparα agonists increase proliferation of peroxisomes in rodent hepatocytes and alter lipid metabolism. in addition, the gene expression profiles indicate a number of leads toward understanding pparα agonist-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in the mouse.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with various concentrations  of three pparα agonists  for  <dig> hr. transactivation analysis indicated that these three agents activated the pparα in a dose-dependent manner. global gene expression analysis was performed on whole mouse genome arrays following exposure of the mouse hepatocyte cultures to pparα agonists. hierarchal clustering analysis of these gene expression profiles indicated that expression profiles of degs were clustered based on doses rather than specific drugs, indicating there is a common effect across this class of compound. gene expression changes were detected in mouse hepatocytes following exposure to  <dig> μm bezafibrate , fenofibrate , and wy- <dig>  . the expression of  <dig> genes was changed in common by at least two of the pparα agonists tested. based on ingenuity pathway analysis, many of these genes  function in lipid metabolism. an additional  <dig> genes were mapped to cancer associated functions. clear dose-dependent changes in degs were determined based on magnitude of fold change. these results provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the hepatic effects of pparα agonists in the mouse.
