BACKGROUND
west nile virus , a member of the family flaviviridae, is a positive-sense, single-stranded rna virus, which is maintained in a mosquito-bird enzootic cycle. upon incidental infection with wnv, approximately 20% of humans experience a self-limiting illness called "west nile fever", and less than 1% develop west nile neuroinvasive disease   <cit> . wnnd is characterized by encephalitis, myelitis, and/or meningitis and can lead to death  <cit> . in addition to acute disease, long term sequelae occur in individuals recovering from west nile fever and wnnd  <cit> . the underlying mechanisms resulting in these sequelae remain unclear, but may partly be due to viral persistence.

several studies provide evidence for persistence of wnv in humans. wnv rna persists in urine of convalescent patients for as long as  <dig>  years after disease onset  <cit> . in blood donors, wnv rna is detected in blood as long as  <dig> days after index donation  <cit> . wnv-specific immunoglobulin m  persists in serum of patients with west nile disease and wnv-positive blood donors for as long as  <dig> to  <dig> months  <cit> . in addition, igm persists in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with wnnd for as long as  <dig> months  <cit> . the long term persistence of igm suggests that virus and/or viral antigen persists in the periphery and possibly in the cns of immunocompetent humans infected with wnv.

the goal of the current study was to further our understanding of wnv persistence, using a mouse model in which wnv rna persists in the cns for up to  <dig> months post-inoculation  <cit> . we characterized the lymphocyte populations present in the cns at various times post-inoculation. cd138+ plasma cells and cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were elevated in the cns of mice for at least  <dig> months after infection with wnv. in addition, wnv-specific plasma cells and wnv-epitope specific cd8+ t cells were present for up to  <dig> wpi, suggesting that wnv is able to persist in the cns despite the presence of virus specific immune cells.

RESULTS
we previously showed that wnv rna persists in the cns of c57bl/ <dig>  mice for up to  <dig> months post-inoculation, and this persistence occurs in the face of active inflammation in the brain and a strong serum antibody response and in mice with subclinical infection  <cit> . our goal in this study was to characterize this inflammation in the cns during viral persistence in our b <dig> mouse model and to determine if the immune cells were virus-specific. brains and spinal cords were harvested from mice, and the phenotypes of infiltrating cns leukocytes were determined at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> wpi. since not all b <dig> mice exhibit west nile disease  <cit> , we distributed mice that had been sick during acute infection  evenly throughout each time point within an individual study  in order not to bias the results. although the numbers of sick mice were small, we did not observe any consistent correlation between disease and any cellular parameter.

for all flow cytometric analyses, cells were gated on the entire population of cd45+ cells, a pan-leukocyte marker. this population included a cd45low population, which are quiescent resident microglial cells, and a cd45high population, which are activated resident microglial cells and infiltrating leukocytes . this gating ensured that differences between wnv-inoculated mice and mock-inoculated mice were not solely due to activated microglial cells, but due to infiltrating leukocytes and/or expansion of microglial cells.

phenotype of lymphocytes in the cns
elevated numbers of cd45+ cells were observed in the brains of wnv-inoculated mice compared to mock-inoculated mice . wnv-inoculated mice had 20- to 30-fold more cd45+ cells in the cns than mock-inoculated mice at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> wpi . similar levels of cd45+ cells were observed in the spinal cords of wnv-inoculated mice . after  <dig> wpi, the number of cd45+ cells in the brains decreased with 2- to 7-fold more cd45+ cells in the brains of wnv-inoculated mice than in mock-inoculated mice, but these differences were not statistically different. in addition, there was more variability from mouse-to-mouse at the later time points, which was consistent with our previous results of variable wnv rna persistence and histologic lesions after  <dig> wpi  <cit> .

we previously observed lymphocytic, plasmacytic inflammation in the brains of mice persistently infected with wnv rna for up to  <dig> months post-inoculation  <cit> ; therefore, we analyzed the leukocytes from brains for lymphocyte markers . wnv-inoculated mice had significantly higher numbers of cd19+ b cells for  <dig> to  <dig> wpi  and cd138+ plasma cells at  <dig> wpi  in brains compared to mock-inoculated mice . cd19+ b cells declined over time after  <dig> wpi . the highest numbers of cd138+ plasma cells were observed at  <dig> and  <dig> wpi with geometric means of approximately  <dig>  cells per brain for wnv-inoculated mice, and plasma cells in the brain slowly declined through  <dig> wpi . similar levels of cd19+ b cells and cd138+ plasma cells were observed in the spinal cords of wnv-inoculated mice .

wnv-inoculated mice had significantly higher numbers of both cd8+ and cd4+ t cells in their brains than mock-inoculated mice from  <dig> through  <dig> wpi . both cd8+ and cd4+ t cells remained constant in the brain through week  <dig> with geometric means of approximately  <dig> cells per brain for wnv-inoculated mice compared to approximately  <dig> cells per brain in mock-inoculated mice. after  <dig> wpi, numbers of t cells in the brain declined to approximately  <dig> cells per brain for wnv-inoculated mice. similar results were found in the spinal cord except that infiltration was delayed by one week for cd4+ t cells  compared to infiltration in the brain .

activated t cells and tregs in the cns
elevated numbers of t cells were present in the cns, but we previously showed that clearance of wnv rna was delayed until after  <dig> months post-inoculation  <cit> . thus, we questioned if the t cells in the cns were activated, and if tregs were present. we examined cd8+ and cd4+ t cells in the cns for two activation markers, cd <dig> and cd <dig> . activated cd8+ and cd4+ t cells were observed by  <dig> wpi with approximately 50% of these cells expressing at least one activation marker . the percentage of activated cd8+ t cells peaked at approximately 90% at  <dig> wpi and remained fairly constant through  <dig> wpi . the percentage of activated cd4+ t cells reached 70% at  <dig> wpi and 90% at  <dig> wpi . in summary, cd8+ and cd4+ t cells in the brain were activated for at least  <dig> wpi.

we hypothesized that tregs may delay viral clearance by inhibiting the cd8+ t cell response; therefore, we examined tregs, defined as cells expressing cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and foxp <dig>  <cit> , in the brains of mice over time . we observed tregs as early as  <dig> wpi in the brains of wnv-inoculated mice  and persisting for at least  <dig> wpi  . the percentages of cd4+ t cells exhibiting the cd25+foxp3+ phenotype increased 3-fold from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi  . the highest percentage of tregs at  <dig> wpi  correlated with the highest percentage of activated cd4+ t cells  and relatively high levels of cd4+ t cells in brains of wnv-inoculated mice .

wnv-specific immune cells in the cns
in our phenotypic analysis, we observed cd138+ plasma cells, and activated cd8+ and cd4+ t cells in the cns of wnv-inoculated animals for at least  <dig> wpi. however, despite an active immune response in the cns, our previous results showed that wnv rna continues to persist in the cns of approximately half of the mice at  <dig> months post-inoculation and a quarter of the mice at  <dig> months post-inoculation  <cit> .

in order to determine whether the inflammatory response that we detected was wnv-specific, we examined the humoral response by performing elispot assays for wnv-specific igm and igg antibody secreting cells  in brains and spleens. at  <dig> wpi, igm asc specific for wnv were detected at relatively high numbers in the spleen , but none were detected in the brain . by  <dig> wpi, seven of eight wnv-inoculated mice had igm asc in brains and spleens . by  <dig> wpi, no igm asc were detected in the brains or spleens , which was most likely due to class switching to igg. wnv-specific igg asc were first detected in spleens at  <dig> wpi and in brains at very low levels at  <dig> wpi . by  <dig> wpi, there were 5-fold more igg asc in brains  than in spleens . the numbers of wnv-specific igg asc remained relatively constant in the two tissues through  <dig> wpi except at  <dig> wpi when only one of eight mice had detectable igg asc in the spleen. seven of eight mice were positive for igg asc in the spleens at  <dig> and  <dig> wpi, suggesting that the immune response was stimulated between  <dig> and  <dig> wpi.

we confirmed the presence of intrathecal antibody in the cns by measuring antibody specific for wnv e and ns <dig> proteins in supernatants from cns homogenates. the kinetics of wnv-specific antibodies in the brain were very similar to the kinetics of the antibody response measured in the serum; however, the levels of antibody were approximately 50-fold lower in brains than in sera . antibodies to e and ns <dig> were first observed in brains at  <dig> wpi in 25% and 12% of mice, respectively . at this time point, asc were not observed in brains , which is most likely due to differences in assay sensitivity. antibodies to e and ns <dig> were also observed in spinal cords of mice, and the kinetics and levels of antibodies were very similar to the results in the brains .

we next examined the wnv-specific cd8+ t cell response to an immunodominant wnv epitope, ssvwnatta in ns4b  <cit> , using mhc class i dimer staining in brains and spleens . wnv epitope-specific cd8+ t cells were significantly higher in the brains of wnv-inoculated mice compared to mock-inoculated mice from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi . wnv epitope-specific cd8+ t cells peaked at  <dig> wpi  , representing approximately 5% of all cd8+ t cells in the brain . by  <dig> wpi in the brain, wnv epitope-specific cd8+ t cells were detected in four of eight mice. in the spleen, wnv epitope-specific cd8+ t cells were significantly higher in wnv-inoculated mice compared to mock-inoculated mice from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi . in contrast to the brain, epitope-specific cd8+ t cells in the spleen were highest at  <dig> wpi and declined through  <dig> wpi . at  <dig> and  <dig> wpi, there was an increase in wnv epitope-specific cd8+ t cells in the spleen, suggesting that the immune response was stimulated between  <dig> and  <dig> wpi as was observed in the independent study that measured asc in the spleen .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
our studies are the first to demonstrate the retention of wnv-specific immune cells in the cns in an immunocompetent mouse model. immune cells were recruited and maintained in the cns for at least  <dig> wpi, including plasma cells, activated t cells and tregs. additionally, wnv-specific asc and cd8+ t cells specific for a dominant epitope of wnv were detected in the brains of mice for up to <dig> wpi, including mice without clinical disease. the presence of specific immune cells is consistent with our previous studies, which showed that wnv persists in the cns in a subset of animals as infectious virus for  <dig> months post-inoculation and viral rna for  <dig> months post-inoculation  <cit> . overall these results suggest that the presence of virus-specific immune cells in the cns is not sufficient for viral clearance.

our current study was limited in that we were unable to correlate wnv persistence and cellular phenotype in the cns within the same individual mouse because we harvested the entire brain and spinal cord for cell analysis. on the other hand, we have used identical methods, including mouse strain, sex and age, viral dose, inoculation route, and wnv strain, as our previous study  <cit> , which has been repeated with very similar results in a number of independent studies. thus, although we do not have correlative data, we have strong evidence that wnv persists as infectious virus in all mice at  <dig> month post-inoculation and as rna in approximately 25% of mice at  <dig> months post-inoculation.

we observed no obvious deficiencies in the immune cell infiltrate in the cns to account for the observed viral persistence in b <dig> mice  <cit> . previous studies have shown that t cells play a crucial role in clearing wnv from cns tissues. mice that lack cd8+ t cells have higher viral burdens, and infectious virus can be recovered for several weeks following initial infection  <cit> . additionally, cd4+ t cells are important for sustaining and maintaining primary cd8+ t cells responses in the brain  <cit> . b cells and antibody play a critical role during wnv infection. μmt mice, which are deficient in b cells, have higher viremia and viral loads in the cns, suggesting that b cells directly limit the early replication of virus in the cns  <cit> ; however, cd8+ t cells are responsible for viral clearance in the cns tissues  <cit> . in our studies, elevated numbers of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, and plasma cells were present in the cns during the time course of the studies.

in addition, we demonstrated that t cells in the brains of mice had early  and late  activation markers through  <dig> wpi. typically, cd <dig> is transiently upregulated during early t cell activation; however, in our studies, cd <dig> was chronically expressed on both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in the brain, which suggests either an ongoing stimulation of resident t cells or fresh recruits infiltrating into the cns. the continual expression of cd <dig> on t cells occurs in other viral models, including dengue, neurotropic influenza and mouse hepatitis viruses, and is a common feature of cd8+ t cells retained in the cns  <cit> . it has been postulated that the chronic expression of cd <dig> identifies cells that are in a state of anergy or non-responsiveness due to prolonged antigen exposure  <cit> . in our studies, both cd <dig> and cd <dig> expressing t cells were recruited and maintained at high percentages in the cns, suggesting that there is ongoing stimulation of these cells via virus and/or antigen. alternatively, there may be bystander activation of non-specific cells and/or a failure to turn off the activation state.

we observed long term persistence of wnv-specific cd8+ t cells in brains of mice, which supports the model of ongoing stimulation. at the end of the studies , half of the mice had detectable cd8+ t cells specific for an immunodominant epitope in wnv in the brain. these findings are consistent with our previous finding that wnv rna and infectious virus persists in the cns at  <dig> wpi in 25% and 12% of mice, respectively  <cit> . furthermore, wnv-specific asc were first detected in brains at  <dig> wpi and persisted for up to  <dig> wpi.

the trafficking and persistence of asc in the cns also occurs in other viral models. we observed that antiviral igm and igg asc in the spleen preceded the detection of asc in the brain, suggesting that b cells from the periphery are activated and subsequently traffic to the cns where they differentiate into asc, as occurs for mouse hepatitis virus  <cit> . similar to our results, virus-specific asc are detected in mouse brains for one year after infection with sindbis virus  <cit>  and for  <dig> days after infection with mouse hepatitis virus  <cit> . since we detected wnv rna for up to six months in the cns  <cit> , the retention of wnv-specific asc within the cns suggests that these cells contribute to continual viral suppression via long term production of intrathecal antibody as observed with other encephalitic viruses  <cit> .

the persistence of wnv in the cns in the face of a specific local immune response raises the following question: why is viral clearance from the cns delayed for  <dig> months in a subset of animals? we propose that the persistent wnv infection in the cns is a low level, smoldering infection that is prevented from spreading by the presence of wnv-specific intrathecal antibody. although t cells are activated, and virus-specific cd8+ t cells are present, we speculate that they are inhibited in order to prevent excessive damage to neurons. this inhibition may be due to tregs, which we observed in the cns during the entire course of our studies. lower levels of tregs are associated with greater disease in humans and mice  <cit> , and thus, tregs may be important in inhibiting immunopathology in the cns and allowing viral persistence. future studies will focus on testing this model and furthering our understanding of the cns immune response during persistent viral infections.
