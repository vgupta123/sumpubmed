BACKGROUND
plant cell walls  are mainly composed of polysaccharides and lignins, forming the major component of plant biomass. knowing which genes are involved in the formation and remodeling of pcws is of great importance as they play many critical roles during plant growth, including regulation of cell differentiation, intercellular adhesion and communication, control of water movement, and defense against invasions by pests and pathogens  <cit> , not to mention that it is the focal point of cellulosic biofuel studies. it is estimated that genes involved in the pcw synthesis, remodeling and turnover may account for about 15% of all ~ <dig>  protein-encoding genes in arabidopsis genome  <cit> , i.e., ~ <dig>  genes. as of today only ~ <dig>  arabidopsis genes have been characterized or predicted to be pcw related according to the purdue cell wall gene families database   <cit> . hence, the vast majority of the pcw related genes in arabidopsis genes are yet to be identified.

experimental elucidation of pcw related genes have been mainly done through forward genetic screening  <cit> , which is time consuming and expensive. the rapid accumulation of genome-scale gene-expression data allows computational prediction of pcw related genes through co-expression analyses. the basic idea is that genes deemed to be co-expressed under multiple conditions tend to be functionally related  <cit> ; hence genes that are co-expressed with known pcw genes may also be pcw related. a number of studies have been carried out for inference of pcw related genes using this or similar ideas. for example, brown et al. and persson et al. published the first two studies on prediction of new pcw related genes through microarray data analyses  <cit> , in which cellulose synthesis  genes, cesa <dig>  cesa <dig>  and cesa <dig> were used as the ‘seeds’ to identify additional genes with the similar expression patterns. a high percentage of the genes predicted to be pcw related in the two studies were later experimentally verified to be indeed involved in pcw biosynthesis  <cit> , which demonstrated the power of co-expression analyses in identifying potential pcw genes, providing good candidates for further experimental validation.

we present here a study on prediction of novel pcw related genes in arabidopsis at a genome scale based on the published gene-expression data collected under  <dig> conditions  <cit> . an unique feature of our study, compared to the previous similar studies, is that we aim to find genes co-expressed with the known pcw related genes under multiple but not necessarily all conditions. this makes our strategy substantially more sensitive and specific in detection of the pcw related genes compared to the published studies  <cit> . but this also raised a very challenging technical problem: how to determine which subsets of the  <dig> conditions should be considered? clearly it is unrealistic to exhaustively go through all  <dig> subsets with at least certain size to search for such co-expressed genes.

to overcome this issue, we have applied a new and generalized clustering technique, called bi-clustering <cit> , to search for gene groups co-expressed under some  of the  <dig> conditions. we specifically employed qubic, a bi-clustering algorithm that we recently developed for solving this type of generalized clustering problem  <cit> .

we have implemented a computational pipeline based on qubic to perform bi-clustering analyses of the  <dig> transcriptomic datasets using the known/annotated pcw related genes  as seeds to generate co-expressed gene modules in arabidopsis. the predicted co-expressed gene modules were then computationally validated to be transcriptionally co-regulated through identification of conserved cis regulatory motifs in the promoters of genes in the same module. using this approach we identified  <dig>  candidate genes that are co-expressed with  <dig> known pcw genes under some conditions with high statistical significance. functional analyses on the candidate genes revealed more detailed functional roles of these genes in pcw synthesis and remodeling. we have carried out detailed functional analyses of the co-expression modules containing the genes related to four major pcw synthesis components, which are likely to encode biological pathways with similar functions but are expressed under distinct conditions. we believe that our overall analysis procedure will be useful for gene expression data analysis in elucidation of other biological pathways in plants in general.

RESULTS
computational pipeline for inference of co-expressed pcw genes
to identify genes co-expressed with the known pcw genes, we developed a computational pipeline . the pipeline consists of the following steps:  identification of co-expressed genes among the known pcw genes using the bi-clustering program qubic;  expansion of the bi-clusters to include additional genes under the same conditions which are previously unknown to be pcw related;  reconstruction of a co-expression gene network containing both known pcw genes and newly recruited genes based on each expanded bi-cluster;  extraction of sub-networks, named co-expression module, within each network; and  prediction, integration and annotation of conserved motifs in the promoter regions of co-expressed genes within each module.

co-expression modules of pcw genes
among the  <dig> known pcw genes, a total of  <dig> co-expression modules are identified, which cover  <dig> known pcw genes . these genes cover five of the six key stages related to pcw syntheses in the purdue database, namely substrate generation; polysaccharide synthases and glycosyl transferases; assembly, architecture and growth; differentiation and secondary wall formation; and signaling and response without any genes involved in secretion and targeting, which might be due to the fact that only a handful of genes are known to be involved in this stage. another reason could be its low gene-expression correlation with other stages, since its machinery is dynamically coupled with cytoskeleton  <cit> .

we have assessed the quality of the predicted modules that contain the known cesa genes responsible for secondary wall cellulose, namely cesa <dig>  cesa <dig> and cesa <dig>  which have been widely studied and well annotated  <cit> . we use the assessment results on these genes as an indicator of the overall quality of the  <dig> predicted modules as quality assessment of all these modules is not doable at this point due to the lack of the ground truth information for the most of them.

we noted that  <dig> modules each contain at least one of three cesa genes . each of these modules also contains many of the genes previously reported or predicted to be co-expressed with cesa genes  <cit> , such as the gt <dig> family gene gatl1/parvus  and gaut12/irx <dig> , the gt <dig> family gene fra <dig> , the gt <dig> family gene irx <dig> , and lignin synthesis related gene irx <dig>   <cit> . besides, the transcription factors  of myb <dig> , known as the master switch for secondary cell wall synthesis  <cit> , is recently reported to be co-expressed with cesa genes  <cit> . 

functional distribution of the candidate pcw genes
our bi-clustering analysis predicted  <dig>  candidate pcw genes, which are co-expressed with  <dig> known pcw genes in  <dig> modules .  <dig> of these modules  contain no more than  <dig> genes .  <dig> modules out of the  <dig> ones contain seed genes from only one pcw synthesis stage.  <dig> of those have over 10% of their genes being seed genes. a total of  <dig> novel pcw genes in these  <dig> modules were predicted to be involved in a specific synthesis stage .

to assess the experimental conditions associated with each module, we extracted the tissue/organ information associated with the co-expression conditions in each module . these modules covered  <dig> out of the total of  <dig> conditions, related to  <dig> different tissue/organs. we performed plant ontology  anatomy enrichment analyses  <cit>  on both the seed and the total genes in each module, and retained the top five po enriched tissues/organs . the po anatomy enrichment results of the seed and the total genes in all modules are respectively related to  <dig> and  <dig> different tissue/organs. for the tissue/organs covered the most genes in each module,  <dig> ones contain over 90% of the total genes in their current modules. this information could be helpful for choosing the right experimental conditions to study the co-expression relationship among genes of the same module.

to derive more detailed function for each of the  <dig>  candidate genes, several software tools were utilized :  <dig> genes encode cazy proteins  <cit> ;  <dig> genes encode enzymes targeted to functions in golgi, as predicted by golgip  <cit> ;  <dig> genes encode transporters according to transportdb  <cit> ; and  <dig> genes encode proteins with at least one transmembrane domain, based on tmhmm  <cit> . in addition, a total of  <dig> tfs were found in  <dig> out of the  <dig> modules, belonging to  <dig> protein families , most of which may be the main transcription regulators of the corresponding modules . many of these transcription regulators have been experimentally verified to regulate the secondary cell-wall synthesis or the biomass formation  <cit> , such as members of the myb, nac and wrky families. 

identification and functional annotation of cis regulatory motifs
for each co-expression module, we have examined if genes in the module may be transcriptionally co-regulated by checking if the promoter regions of these genes share conserved sequence motifs as potential regulatory elements, using the cgmd pipeline . overall,  <dig>  non-redundant motif instances were predicted , covering the promoters of  <dig>  genes , representing  <dig>  highly conserved motif groups .  <dig> of the  <dig> modules  each contain at least one conserved motif shared by at least 80% of the genes in the module , providing a strong evidence that most genes in the same module are transcriptionally co-regulated. for the all motifs in each module, we also provided the p-values using bobro   <cit> .

sequence comparison with known cis regulatory motifs in the place and agris databases reveal that  <dig> of the  <dig>  motifs  match well with  <dig> of the  <dig>  annotated motifs , indicating the high quality of our prediction . out of the  <dig>  motifs,  <dig> are palindromic . for the  <dig> novel genes with annotated pcw stage information, they share  <dig> conserved motifs with known pcw genes in the same stage . all these demonstrate the high quality of our predicted co-expression gene modules.

to assess the prediction specificity, we have checked a null hypothesis that the number of the known motifs in agris and place matched by our predicted motifs is essentially the same to the number of such motifs matched by predicted motifs based on groups of arbitrarily selected genes from the whole arabidopsis genome using a chi-square test   <cit> . the test rejected the null hypothesis with a p-value,  <dig> e- <dig>  indicating the high statistical significance of our predicted motifs.

we have also checked if the  <dig>  predicted motifs are present in the promoter sequences of their corresponding orthologous genes in populus, using the fuzznuc program of the emboss package  <cit> . we identified  <dig>  pairs of orthologous genes between arabidopsis and populus , covering 53% of the  <dig>  genes . we scanned the promoter sequences of  <dig>  genes of populus using the  <dig>  predicted motifs. our search found that  <dig> of the  <dig>  motifs  were conserved in  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  pairs of orthologous genes , containing  <dig> known pcw genes and  <dig>  candidate genes. we therefore conclude that these  <dig> motifs are more likely to be functional motifs and the corresponding  <dig>  arabidopsis genes may represent the most reliable prediction of the pcw genes.

location preference and abundance in the promoter regions of the predicted motifs
out of the  <dig>  conserved motifs,  <dig> are predicted to be the binding sites of myb related tfs, and  <dig> to be the binding sites of lignin biosynthesis related tfs . it is known that different cis regulatory motifs may have different preferences in terms of their locations in the promoters  <cit> . here we use the ac element-related motifs as a case study, which are known to be present in the promoters of most lignin biosynthetic genes  <cit> . we found that  <dig> and  <dig> motifs in our identified motifs correspond to the ac-i and ac-ii elements, respectively. for each of the two elements, we calculated the distance between the translation start site and the ac element of each lignin synthesis gene; and plotted the distribution of the distances. the two distributions are largely similar except that the ac-ii element-related motifs have a higher percentage located between  <dig>  bps and  <dig>  bps away from atg than the ac-i element-related motifs . this may suggest the potential difference between the two ac elements in terms of their locations in the promoter regions. 

we also noted that one gene may have multiple unique motifs in its promoter region and one motif could appears multiple times  in the same promoter. we noted that most of the annotated/predicted pcw genes each have at least five distinct motifs  and a motif sequence could have up to  <dig> copies in the promoter regions of the genes under consideration . the location distribution and abundance of motifs in one gene’s promoter region may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . for instance, figure  <dig> shows that atcesa <dig>  has  <dig> unique motifs in its upstream region and each motif has one to  <dig> copies;  <dig> of them  are also found in the promoters of the cesa <dig> orthologous gene in populus, hence indicating that such motifs are conserved during evolution. specifically, motif cluster_71_gtacag has the most number of copies and is conserved in both arabidopsis and populus. this motif matches the abre <dig> motif  in place, which is related to drought, low-temperature or high-salt stress . in addition, cluster_9_ccacc in the upstream of cesa <dig> is a variant of the ac element bound by myb tfs  <cit> . 

functional prediction for co-expression modules
for each identified co-expression module, we have inferred the general functionality of the module as a whole based on the functional annotations of its known pcw genes. specifically, we focused on modules containing four groups of seed genes related to pcw synthesis, namely cellulose syntheses, genes of the lignin synthesis pathway, genes of the nucleotide diphosphate sugar  synthesis, and genes of selected gt families   <cit> . as a result, we identified  <dig> such modules:  <dig> modules are related to cellulose syntheses;  <dig> related to ndp-sugar interconversion;  <dig> related to lignin syntheses; and  <dig> related to gt families . in these  <dig> modules,  <dig> contain tfs, which might play a role in the regulation of the synthesis of some specific pcw components .

we also compared the consistency level between the functional annotations of each of the  <dig> modules and those of their corresponding predicted cis regulatory motifs for the module. specifically, we first selected three most reliable motifs in each module  based on the number of genes covered and the conservation between arabidopsis and populus, and compared if the functional annotations of these motifs are consistent with the functional annotations of the module, i.e. check whether each motif belongs to one of the aforementioned myb or lignin-synthesis related motifs . of the  <dig> modules,  <dig>  have consistent functional annotations from the two sources . for example, in a lignin-synthesis related module 86_ <dig>  the most reliable motifs are cluster_11cluster_ <dig>  and cluster_ <dig>  which are respectively annotated to be known ac elements and two myb binding sites, previously implicated in regulation of lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . in a cellulose-synthesis related module 119_ <dig>  one of the three motifs, cluster_ <dig>  is annotated to be a binding site of the r2r3-type myb tf, which is known to be involved in cellulose syntheses  <cit> . in addition, out of the  <dig> modules,  <dig> have un-annotated motifs. by excluding these, the overall consistency between the two annotated sources is 47%, indicating our functional inferences are generally reliable.

in the  <dig> modules, we identified the ‘hot links’ that are essential for pcw synthesis. the idea is that a few of high activity interactions might dominate the biochemical activity of the whole genetic network, comparing to the surrounding less active interactions  <cit> . among the  <dig> modules, there are  <dig> groups of ‘hot links’ found in  <dig> modules;  <dig> such ‘hot links’ groups contain  <dig> seed genes of the four aforementioned groups  and  <dig> candidate genes. these ‘hot links’ represent the most dominated co-expression relationships in the  <dig> modules. for example, cesa <dig>  cesa <dig> and cesa <dig> have been previously reported to form a protein complex for cellulose synthesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
co-expression analysis has been widely used for identification of functional genes. in this study, we predicted new candidate genes related to pcw in arabidopsis at a genomic scale. compared to previous studies, this study has several novelties and advantages. first, we used a bi-clustering technique to analyze transcriptomic data collected multiple conditions, which represents an alternative method of traditional clustering for identification of co-expressed genes under some but not necessarily all provided conditions. second, we used the co-expression relationships with all known pcw genes as seeds  to identify new candidate genes, which led to the identification of a significantly larger set of new candidates compared to previous studies. third, we used a network topology-based approach to identify highly co-expressed gene modules within each network, which makes our prediction more reliable. fourth, using a combination of three motif prediction tools, our motif prediction is more reliable, which is evidenced by our functional prediction consistency assessment. lastly, our functional prediction at both individual gene level and the module level is informative and reliable through using three complementary analysis methods. the statistical validation for each analytical step ensures the overall quality of our computational analysis results. we anticipate our approach and data represented here will be useful for other researchers working on gene expression data analysis and pcw synthesis.
