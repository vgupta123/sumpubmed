BACKGROUND
plants belonging to the leguminosae family have the ability to interact with rhizobia and produce a nitrogen-fixing organ, the root nodule. the symbiotic relationship starts with a molecular cross-talk between the two partners. host-plant derived molecules are perceived by rhizobia and activate the synthesis of nod factors , which, in turn, elicit a variety of biochemical responses in the root hair, including changes in ion fluxes, membrane depolarization, the oscillation of the cytosolic calcium and modification in the cytoskeleton  <cit>  that lead to root hair deformation, to infection thread  formation and eventually to the penetration of the bacteria into the epidermis  <cit> .

nf perception relies on a pair of orthologous genes belonging to the lysm-family receptor-like kinases , nfp and lyk <dig> in m. truncatula and nfr <dig> and nfr <dig> in l. japonicus <cit> . closely related genes for nf perception were also found in other leguminous plants such as pea and soybean  <cit> . the perception of the nf through the lysm-rlks activates a signalling pathway, termed the common symbiotic pathway  <cit> , constituted in m. truncatula by dmi <dig> , dmi <dig> , which are involved in generating the calcium oscillations  <cit> , and dmi <dig> , which is responsible for the decoding of calcium spiking amplitude and frequency  <cit> . nf-induced early infection events also involve the activity of phospholipase c and d  <cit> . nf perception and the activation of the signalling cascade take place in the root epidermis. at the same time, pericycle and cortical cells re-enter the cell cycle and form a primordium from which a nodule meristem arises  <cit> . the primordium is invaded by rhizobia harboured inside infection threads between  <dig> and 96 h post root hair infection.

cell division is mainly controlled by two crucial plant phytohormones, auxin and cytokinin, which regulate the progression of cells through the cell cycle  <cit> . concentrations and the auxins to cytokinins ratio both play a pivotal role in determining whether and where cells are about to enter the mitotic phase in plants  <cit> . the reduction of auxin transport in rhizobia-inoculated  <cit>  roots changes not only the auxin fluxes but also the auxin to cytokinin ratio at the site of nodule initiation. one of the l. japonicus spontaneous nodulation mutants carries an alteration in the lotus histidine kinase  <dig>  gene that acts as a cytokinins receptor  <cit> , whilst the lhk <dig> loss-of-function mutants show a marked reduction in the number of primordia and mature nodules  <cit> . in m. truncatula the rna interference -mediated down-regulation of cytokinin response <dig> , the lhk <dig> ortholog, resulted in a marked reduction of the cortical cell division and in a block of the majority of the its at root hair level  <cit> . thus cytokinin seems to be involved in the coordination of the epidermal and cortical pathways of nodulation most likely through the nodule inception  gene  <cit> . until now, nin has been the supposed key gene in coordinating the nfs signalling and entry pathways  <cit> .

recent studies have suggested that membrane microdomains and associated proteins such as flotillin <dig> , flot <dig> and m. truncatula symbiotic remorin  <dig> , are involved in epidermal responses to rhizobia and play a role in it formation  <cit> .

the extensive analysis of the m. truncatula transcriptome showed that a group of small, cysteine-rich peptides are up-regulated during the establishment of symbiosis  <cit> . mtn <dig> is a nodulin gene that was identified by means of a differential screening approach and is expressed in mature nodules  <cit> . the sequence homology suggests that mtn <dig> belongs to the plant non-specific lipid transfer protein  super-family characterized by an eight cysteine motif and the phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that it has high homology with arabidopsis thaliana dir <dig> and groups with plant nsltp-like protein  <cit> . like other proteins belonging to the plant ns-ltp super-family, mtn <dig> is able to bind lipids in vitro and to inhibit the growth of pathogens and symbionts  <cit> . the rnai-mediated mtn <dig> suppression resulted in a marked reduction in the number of nodules developed on transgenic hairy roots suggesting that mtn <dig> is required for nodulation  <cit> . however, the stages of the nodulation pathway that mtn <dig> activity might be involved in are still unknown.

the aim of this study was to gain further insight into the function of mtn <dig> in the m. truncatula-s. meliloti interaction. our data indicated that mtn <dig> is a nf-responsive gene expressed at a very early phase of legume-rhizobium interaction in the root hairs and in the epidermal cells. the phenotypic analysis of mtn5-silenced roots showed that mtn <dig> is implicated in limiting root hair curling and that this role is necessary for an efficient colonization of nodule primordia. mtn <dig> response to rhizobia is dependent on phospholipase d  activity and does not seem to require dmi <dig>  furthermore, flot <dig> induction is drastically reduced in mtn5-silenced roots. this study demonstrates that mtn <dig> is involved in the control of rhizobial infection by acting in two apparently contrasting ways: firstly by restricting the invasion at the root epidermis and secondly by promoting the infection in the root cortex.

RESULTS
prediction of regulatory motifs in the mtn <dig> promoter
previous data demonstrated that mtn <dig> is precociously induced in s. meliloti-inoculated roots, is expressed in the root nodules and that its function is required for the successful symbiotic interaction between s. meliloti and m. truncatula <cit> . with the aim of gaining a deeper insight into the regulation of mtn <dig> expression, the putative mtn <dig> promoter was analysed by means of an in silico approach for the detection of conserved responsive elements.

the sequence spanning  <dig>  kb upstream of the atg translation start codon of the mtn <dig> gene  was analysed by using the place algorithm  <cit> . along with common elements found in promoter sequences such as tata and caat boxes, the consensus sequences of the organ-specific elements  ose1rootnodule and ose2rootnodule , which are characteristic of promoters active in infected cells of root nodules  <cit> , were found in the mtn <dig> promoter, although not canonically spaced . moreover, the nucleotide sequence aattt, termed nodulation responsive element , was found to recur twice in the 590 bp upstream of the atg initiation codon. this responsive element was demonstrated to be present in the promoter sequence of well characterized nodulin genes such as mtenod <dig>  mtnin and ern <dig> and to function as a cis-acting element targeted by the gras type nsp <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . the in silico analysis of the mtn <dig> promoter also highlighted the presence of motifs involved in the hormonal control of gene expression such as arr1at and auxrepsiaa <dig>  responsive to cytokinin and auxin respectively  <cit> . interestingly the auxin response element auxrepsiaa <dig> had been previously shown to be tissue specific and characteristic of those genes that are expressed in the root apical meristem of pea plants  <cit> .

mtn <dig> expression is induced by both rhizobia-derived molecules and plant hormones
on the basis of the motifs predicted by the place algorithm  <cit> , mtn <dig> expression was analyzed after treating the roots with both microorganism elicitor molecules and phytohormones. mtn <dig> expression is up-regulated after treatment with s. meliloti nfs , exhibiting an approximately 15-fold increase in nf treated roots compared with untreated roots . however, a transient induction of mtn <dig> transcript level was also observed after inoculation with a s. meliloti strain defective in nf production  <cit> . to test whether other rhizobia-derived signals potentially contribute to mtn <dig> induction, we tested mtn <dig> expression in roots treated with exopolysaccharides  extracted from s. meliloti <cit> . the roots were also treated with molecules like chitin oligomers  that can be originated from the degradation of fungal cell wall  <cit> . in roots treated with 1 μg/ml eps, the mtn <dig> transcript level increased about 5-fold as compared to the level in untreated roots, whilst mtn <dig> expression was not affected by chitin treatment  .

considering that bioinformatic analysis of the mtn <dig> promoter predicts the presence of elements responsive to auxins and cytokinins, the phytohormones involved in the regulation of root nodules initiation and growth, the effects of auxin and cytokinin treatments on root mtn <dig> expression were evaluated. as reported in figure 1c, both α-naphthyl acetic acid  and benzyl-amino-purine  supplied to roots can induce mtn <dig> expression in a wide range of concentrations . auxin displayed a similar ability to stimulate mtn <dig> expression at each of the concentrations tested whilst the effect of cytokinin was more pronounced at the lowest concentration used  . interestingly, a stimulatory effect of auxin and cytokinin on mtn <dig> expression was detected in m. truncatula jemalong in vitro-cultured leaf explants after a combined treatment with naa and bap  <cit> .

the in silico analysis of the mtn <dig> promoter sequence and the experimental evidence suggest that mtn <dig> primarily responds to rhizobia-derived signals and can be regulated by hormones involved in the coordination of epidermal and cortical responses and in nodule formation.

mtn <dig> expression pattern during rhizobial infection and nodule development
to investigate the spatial and temporal pattern of mtn <dig> expression at the tissue and cell levels, mtn <dig> promoter activity was monitored in mtn5p::gus transgenic roots with and without rhizobial inoculation. in non-inoculated roots, mtn5p::gus is expressed at the root tip . the β-glucuronidase  activity was also detected at the site of lateral root emergence and along the whole length of young lateral roots; as lateral roots get older, gus activity was confined to the root tip .

mtn5p::gus transgenic roots showed localized induction of gus activity as a consequence of s. meliloti inoculation. 3 hours post-inoculation , gus activity was visible in the epidermis as localized spots and in the root hairs . at more advanced stages of infection , the mtn <dig> promoter activity was detected in the root cortex, in close proximity to the central stele .

during the early stages of nodule development, considerable activity of the mtn <dig> promoter could be observed at the boundary between the root cortex and the central stele  . as primordia grow and emerge from the root, the expression of the gus reporter is detectable in the whole nodule . in fully developed root nodules, the promoter activity was predominantly localized in the distal zone . the analysis of mtn <dig> promoter activity highlighted the presence of mtn <dig> expression during rhizobial infection in those cells that underwent structural changes and membrane rearrangements  and in tissues showing a high cell division activity such as root meristems and nodule primordia.

the temporal and spatial pattern of mtn <dig> promoter activity indicates that mtn <dig> can be considered as an early marker of m. truncatula and s. meliloti interaction together with other epidermal nodulins such as rip <dig> and enod <dig>  which are putatively involved in cell wall modification before the formation of infection threads  <cit> .

mtn <dig> influences enod <dig> response to rhizobia and is not required for nin induction
in order to understand the relationships between mtn <dig> and other components of the early nfs signalling pathway, the expression of two early nodulins, enod <dig> and nin was analysed in transgenic adventitious hairy roots carrying a hairpin construct  for mtn <dig> silencing  <cit> . composite plants were micro-flood inoculated with s. meliloti and roots were collected at different times after infection . the roots considered in this experiment were preselected for their transgenic status on the basis of the fluorescent signal deriving from the dsred marker gene present in the t-dna. mtn <dig> expression was induced very rapidly after s. meliloti inoculation  in adventitious control roots, which were generated from the infection with agrobacterium rhizogenes carrying an empty predroot vector. in inoculated mtn5hp transgenic roots, mtn <dig> expression was significantly reduced at each time point considered compared to that in control roots . the steady state level of the mtn <dig> transcript decreased on average by 70%, ranging from approximately 62%  to 80% .

the expression of enod <dig>  an early marker of pre-infection and infection phases of rhizobial symbiosis, showed a progressive increase starting from  <dig> hpi in the control adventitious roots. in mtn5-silenced root tissues, enod <dig> was already strongly up-regulated at  <dig> hpi and its expression was significantly enhanced as compared to that in control roots in the following stages of infection .

mtnin is required for nodule primordia initiation having a role in the coordination of epidermal and cortical responses  <cit> . in control roots the expression of mtnin was up-regulated starting from  <dig> hpi. mtn <dig> silencing did not significantly alter nin mrna steady state levels at each time point examined in the analysis .

to date, the data available regarding the involvement of nodulin genes in the nfs signalling pathway place both enod <dig> and mtnin downstream of the calcium spiking  <cit> . to analyze the relationship between mtn <dig> expression and the calcium oscillation we used the recently established tnt <dig> transposon mutant collection of m. truncatula r <dig>  <cit>  and searched for an insertion line in dmi <dig> gene, which is required for the generation of calcium spiking  <cit> . we identified the line nf <dig>  which carries a transposon insertion  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the translation initiation site of dmi <dig> gene. plants were propagated and were subsequently screened for homozygous offsprings by polymerase chain reaction  . in the nf <dig> homozygous line, dmi <dig> expression was almost completely abolished  . in the s. meliloti-inoculated nf <dig> mutant, the mtnin induction was eliminated , whilst mtn <dig> showed a wild-type behaviour . this finding suggests that mtn <dig> activation might occur upstream of calcium spiking, although we cannot exclude a priori that other tnt <dig> insertions, potentially present in the dmi <dig> homozygous mutant seedlings, could affect mtn <dig> expression in trans.

pld activity is required for the response of mtn <dig> to s. meliloti
several pieces of research have demonstrated that the signalling cascade activated by nfs implicates, at an early stage, the intermediation of heterotrimeric g-proteins and small gtpases  <cit> , which, in turn, stimulate the functionality of phospholipase c  and d   <cit> . according to the current model, the products of hydrolysis generated by plc  stimulate the activity of ligand-gated calcium pumps causing the increase in the cytosolic ca2+ concentration, whereas the pld product  seems to be required for the onset of a kinase/phosphatase signalling cascade, that eventually leads to the activation of nodulin genes and to the reorganization of the cytoskeleton in preparation for the root hair inward growth  <cit> .

with the aim of investigating the dependence of mtn <dig> induction on the two parallel pathways of the lipid signalling, a pharmacological approach was adopted, using specific inhibitors of plc and pld . as already demonstrated, the application of both 100 μm neomycin and 68 mm n-butanol did not cause a significant loss of viability in root hair cells  <cit> . m. truncatula seedlings, pretreated with neomycin and subsequently inoculated with s. meliloti, showed a 13-fold up-regulation of mtn <dig>  compared to untreated, control roots, whereas in the absence of the pharmacological treatment, inoculated roots displayed a 4-fold mtn <dig> induction indicating that neomycin did not repress mtn <dig> induction. similarly, the treatment with the plc inhibitor alone resulted in an approximately 9-fold increase of mtn <dig> expression. analogous stimulatory effects were reported for other nodulin genes after treatment with plc inhibitors and interpreted as the result of membrane trafficking alteration or microtubule reorganization  <cit> . these data suggest that the mtn <dig> induction due to rhizobial inoculation and to neomycin treatment are most probably independent effects . the n-butanol competes for the phosphatidyl group acting as antagonist of pa production by pld enzymatic activity  <cit> . interestingly, s. meliloti-inoculated roots treated with the pld inhibitor did not show a significant variation in mtn <dig> expression when compared to control roots indicating that the n-butanol treatment prevents mtn <dig> induction . the treatment with tert-butanol, a butanol isomer, which does not act as a phosphatidyl group acceptor, did not hamper mtn <dig> induction . on the whole, these results suggest that mtn <dig> response is dependent on pa production.

mtn <dig> influences root hair curling and primordia invasion
the microscopic observations of mtn5hp hairy roots inoculated with a rhizobium strain harbouring the hema::lacz reporter gene revealed a significantly higher number - about twice that of control roots - of root hair curling events . however, the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside  staining of rhizobia highlighted that the number of bacteria-colonized primordia was significantly reduced  in mtn5hp roots as compared to that in the control samples  and, as already reported, the composite plants bearing mtn5hp silenced roots also showed a reduction in the number of fully developed nodules . nonetheless, the total number of nodule primordia did not vary significantly between mtn5-silenced and control roots  nor were any phenotypic alterations observed in curled root hairs such as excessive curling or root hair deformation . it was also apparent that nodule primordia and mature nodules of mtn5hp plants were not dissimilar in morphology to those produced in control roots . on the basis of these data, the transcript levels of m. truncatula flotillin  <dig> , a gene involved in the bacterial entry pathway, were compared in mtn5-silenced roots and control roots. flot <dig> showed itself to be readily induced in control roots after rhizobial inoculation , reached a maximum of expression at  <dig> hpi and decreased afterwards. in mtn5hp roots infected with the symbiont, a drastic decrease of flot <dig> expression  was detected between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi .

discussion
the early nodulin mtn <dig> was identified by means of a subtractive hybridization approach  <cit>  and, according to the sequence homology, was annotated as a putative lipid transfer protein  <cit> . the in vitro characterization of mtn <dig> recombinant protein highlighted that it has the ability to bind lipid and counteract the growth of microorganisms  <cit>  suggesting a possible involvement in the limitation of the rhizobial invasion. however, the functional study based on both silencing and over-expression approaches showed that mtn <dig> function is required for a successful establishment of the symbiosis  <cit> .

to shed light on the molecular role of mtn <dig> in m. truncatula-s. meliloti symbiosis, we initially focused on the regulation of mtn <dig> expression. the data presented in this work confirm that the induction of mtn <dig> is a nf-responsive event, but also show that mtn <dig> expression is probably controlled by several additional signals, either rhizobia-derived effectors or phytohormones, auxin and cytokinins. these observations are consistent with the finding that mtn <dig> is induced at different stages of symbiotic interaction from pre-infection to mature nodules and also with the constitutive expression in root tips of principal and lateral roots. the rhizobial infection does not modify mtn <dig> expression at the root tip level, but it triggers very early the induction of mtn <dig> in the epidermal tissues  and in the root cortex . thus we propose that mtn <dig> can be regarded as an early molecular marker of m. truncatula and s. meliloti interaction.

the detection of mtn <dig> promoter activity in root hairs and in localized spots of the epidermis supports the idea that mtn <dig> might be involved in pre-infection or/and infection events. pre-infection responses to rhizobia are accompanied by the induction of the marker gene enod <dig> in the root epidermis, whereas in later phases its expression is confined to the invaded zones of the roots  <cit> . the transcription factor mtnin seems to regulate enod <dig> activity contributing to the restriction of its expression to the s. meliloti-responsive zone of the root  <cit> . in inoculated mtn5-silenced roots, the enod <dig> induction is not prevented. indeed, enod <dig> expression is strongly stimulated in mtn5-silenced roots compared with that in control roots, indicating that mtn <dig> function is required for controlling enod <dig> expression. in addition, mtn <dig> down-regulation does not inhibit nin transcription suggesting that the mis-regulation of enod <dig> in mtn5-silenced roots is independent of the nin effect on enod <dig> transcription. the stimulation of enod <dig> expression in mtn5-silenced roots could also be interpreted as an indirect consequence of the impaired rhizobial infection.

the phenotypic analysis of mtn5-silenced roots confirms a role of this nodulin in pre-infection stages of the symbiosis; in fact, although abnormalities in root hair curling were not observed, the number of curled root hairs was significantly greater in comparison to that in control roots. an enhanced responsiveness of root hairs to rhizobia was observed in several infection-defective leguminous plants  <cit> , which could suggest the presence of a mechanism that represses root cell competence in wild type plants  <cit> . from our data we can infer that mtn <dig> might be implicated in the mechanism that limits root hair curling.

the host plant controls the rhizobial invasion with different strategies  <cit> . for instance, the induction of pathogen defence genes is one of the early events detected during symbiosis and it has been indicated as one of the mechanisms involved in it abortion  <cit> . at later stages, the expression of these defence genes usually declines probably as a consequence of bacteria recognition by the host plant mediated also by molecular signals, e.g. exopolisaccharides, produced by rhizobia  <cit> . furthermore, host plants limit the number of nodules through a mechanism termed autoregulation of nodulation that implicates the intervention of shoot receptor kinases  <cit> . mtn <dig> belongs to the non specific ltp family that includes apoplastic proteins with inhibitory activity against pathogens and itself possesses the capacity to limit s. meliloti growth in vitro <cit> . it has also been suggested that mtn <dig> could belong to a group of ltps having a role in plant-microbe interaction signalling  <cit> . mtn <dig> might act by limiting the stable attachment and/or proliferation of rhizobia at the surface of epidermal cells/root hairs, by modulating, for instance, either the perception or the activity of rhizobia-derived signal molecules. besides the increased curling, mtn5-silenced roots showed a reduction in the number of invaded root nodules, indicating that mtn <dig> could also participate, either directly or indirectly, in the regulation of bacterial invasion. if this is so, the limitation of curling events might favour the penetration of bacteria at a restricted number of infected spots.

several experimental observations are consistent with the existence of a parallel nf-mediated signalling pathway that operates in root hair curling and bacterial entry acting in concert with the common symbiotic pathway  <cit> . furthermore, pharmacological studies have demonstrated that lipid signalling is implicated in both root hair deformation and it initiation  <cit> . the response of mtn <dig> to rhizobium is dependent on pld activity and we obtained a first indication that it might be independent of dmi <dig>  a component of the common symbiotic pathway. further investigations are needed to prove the independence of mtn <dig> induction from ca2+ spiking and to ascertain whether mtn <dig> is a component of the parallel nf-mediated pathway that controls root hair curling and/or rhizobial entry. it was recently discovered that a member of the flotillin family, flot <dig>  which is up-regulated during early symbiotic events and localized in membrane microdomains in infected root tips, plays a role in it initiation and elongation  <cit> . our observations indicate that mtn <dig> acts upstream with respect to flot <dig>  supporting the idea that mtn <dig> participates in the events preceding it development.

bacterial infection occurring at the epidermis level is coordinated with the cortical process that promotes nodule formation and development  <cit> . the formation of nodule primordia requires the perception of ca2+ oscillations by calcium-activated kinase ccamk  and the activation of cytokinin signalling. in addition, the phytohormone auxin participates both locally and systemically in the regulation of nodule organogenesis  <cit> . both auxin and cytokinins induce mtn <dig> expression in vitro. furthermore, in s. meliloti inoculated roots the mtn <dig> transcript localizes in the inner cortex at a site where cellular divisions take place to form the nodule primordium. these findings would suggest the possibility that mtn <dig> participates in nodule organogenesis. however, we observed that the total number of nodule primordia in mtn5-silenced roots did not differ from that measured in wild type roots. therefore, mtn <dig> does not seem to be required for nodule primordia initiation. this is consistent with the finding that mtn <dig> functions downstream or more likely independently of mtnin .

even though nodule initiation appears not to be impaired, the number of invaded primordia was markedly reduced in mtn5-silenced roots. thus the decreased number of mature nodules in mtn5-silenced roots could be the consequence of the curtailed capacity of the rhizobia to invade the primordia. it has in fact been reported that bacterial invasion can be crucial for the maintenance of nodule developmental program  <cit> . on the other hand, we cannot exclude that mtn <dig> might have a direct role in promoting the maintenance of nodule primordia. further investigations are necessary to clarify this point.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here demonstrate that mtn <dig> participates in the molecular events occurring at the epidermis after nf perception and pld activation and before root hair invasion and that its function is dispensable for nodule initiation but required for nodule invasion. plants lipid transfer proteins are usually small, secreted, basic proteins, characterized by the presence of a hydrophobic cavity that enables the interaction with lipid molecules. members of the plant ltp superfamily display a wide range of biological activities such as a defensive role against pathogens, deposition of cuticular wax, modification of cell walls and pollen tube guidance  <cit> . based on sequence similarity, mtn <dig> and a. thaliana dir <dig>  an nsltp implicated in pathogen defence systemic signalling  <cit>  have been assigned to a sub-group of ns-ltp putatively involved in lipid-mediated signalling  <cit> . the lily ltp sca and the a. thaliana sca, which are implicated in pollen tube growth, have also been put forward as signal transducers  <cit> .

we propose that mtn <dig> plays a role in the process that regulates the competence of epidermal cells for rhizobial infection. thus mtn <dig> would be part of the machinery that gives the host control over the mutualistic partner in order to preserve plant fitness. to explore the hypothesis that mtn <dig> functions as a signal transducer in these processes, the identification of mtn <dig> interacting proteins or ligands would be necessary.
