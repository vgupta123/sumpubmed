BACKGROUND
high salinity, together with low temperatures and water stress, are responsible for the large margin existing between the potential yield in tons hectar- <dig> and the real harvest yield in several crops worldwide  <cit> . in semi-arid agricultural areas of the world, soil salinization is tightly linked to the extensive use of artificial irrigation, which in combination with extended dry seasons, very quickly turns formerly productive areas practically into desserts  <cit> . in the future, this effect will even increase due to the high demand of water from other non-agriculture sectors , whereas the possibilities to increase any crop's productivity through irrigation will necessarily decrease  <cit> . despite the remarkable ability of plants to cope with a wide range of stresses, the race against the continuously deteriorating environmental conditions on our planet will be lost unless new plant breeding strategies for abiotic stress-tolerance are developed.

chickpea, one of the most important staple food legume crops worldwide, is cultivated in regions considered to be "the eye of the hurricane" in view of the adverse conditions like poor-watered and saline soils  <cit> . the increasing demand of production, and the adaptation of this crop to less appropriate, even poor soils, forces to study the high salinity response mechanisms of this important non-model plant.

plants under salt stress have to battle against two severe impacts: i) the ionic disequilibrium, caused by the increased amount of sodium in the soil; and ii) the osmotic misbalance, in which the osmotic potential of the soil drastically decreases  <cit> . additionally, the metabolic alterations and high demand of energy caused by the first two stresses are leading to a third and sometimes more lethal obstacle: the oxidative stress  <cit> . as a consequence, salinity tolerance is expected to depend on genes encoding proteins 1) limiting the rate of na2+ uptake from the soil and managing its transport throughout the plant, 2) adjusting the ionic and osmotic balance of cells in roots and shoots, 3) regulating leaf development and the onset of senescence, and  controlling the overproduction of reactive oxygen species  <cit> .

in model plants, extensive knowledge of biochemical and molecular processes underlying salt-stress responses has been accumulated over the past decades. among several other striking advances in arabidopsis thaliana, the signal transduction components of the salt overly sensitive pathway , a cascade activated by ionic disequilibrium, have been extensively characterized  <cit> . further on, the activation of a specific salt-responsive map-kinase signalling cascade  has been uncovered  <cit> . several studies of calcium-dependent protein kinases , a kinase family linked to stress signalling, revealed the mechanisms of ca2+ as messenger molecule in plants under stress alarm  <cit> . the dynamics of the transcriptome associated with ros equilibrium  in plants has also been under intense scrutiny. for example, in arabidopsis ros-driven expression profiles on microarrays demonstrated that at least  <dig> , out of  <dig>  evaluated transcripts, changed their expression level upon ros induction  <cit> .

in sharp contrast to the importance of chickpeas as staple food and industrial raw material, the salt-responses at the transcriptome and proteome levels had only been dealt with at very low throughput until some years ago, i.e. tens, or at the most, hundreds of genes had been considered  <cit> . in the last couple of years, massive sequencing approaches made it possible to gather information from thousands of complete ests, extending the available sequence information for previously under-studied organisms. for chickpea, a pioneer work has already started to uncover large portions of the transcriptome under abiotic stress, increasing the number of ests sequences deposited in the public domain up to more than  <dig>  entries  <cit> .

in the present work we profit from the high resolution power of supersage coupled to the roche  <dig> life/apg gs flx titanium ngs technology to characterize the complete transcriptome of salt-stressed chickpea plants, especially at the onset of the stress. here we report on  <dig>  transcripts representing  <dig>  unique  <dig> bp tags from roots of the salt-tolerant variety inrat- <dig>   <dig> hours after  <dig> mm nacl-treatment. in parallel, the expression of  <dig>  transcripts grouped in 13' <dig> unitags was monitored in nodules of the same plants. only a total of  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts, respectively, were commonly up- or down-regulated  under salt stress in both organs, suggesting a strong organ-specific differential response upon salt stress.

using the information generated by recent massive cdna sequencing in chickpea, more than  <dig>  of the obtained  <dig> bp tags were validated by ests deposited in the public domain, adding valuable information in terms of i) their dynamics in the tested variety and under experimental conditions, ii) their differential expression in roots and nodules of the same plant towards salt stress, and iii) the existence of large sets of very similar alternative transcript isoforms detected in the form of snps-associated alternative tags   <cit> .

after est-bridged unitags annotation to fabaceae and arabidopsis mrnas, more than  <dig>  unitags could be linked to uniprot entries. further on, gene ontology  categories over-representation analysis enabled us to filter out enriched biological processes among the differentially expressed unitags in chickpea roots and nodules under salt stress. subsequently, the gathered information was cross-checked with stress-related pathways for finer selection of potential transcripts of interest.

the vast amount of information generated here forced us to focus on transcripts associated with the generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species as well as on transcripts associated with the maintenance of na+ homeostasis, as example scenarios where intense transcriptome-remodelling is occurring after stress onset. nevertheless the present work opens also several gates for the possible identification of new genes related to other pathways, and the incorporation of previously not stress-associated genes into the salt-stress context.

RESULTS
abundance of  <dig> bp tags
a total of  <dig>   <dig> bp tags from roots  and nodules , respectively, of the salt-tolerant variety inrat- <dig> were sequenced from untreated plants  and plants treated with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> h. after grouping the sequenced tags, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique transcripts  were extracted from roots and nodules, respectively . the expression profiles of  <dig>  unitags from both organs were revealed.

in roots, less than 1% percent of the  <dig> bp tags were present in very high copy numbers , whereas 9% and 90% of the transcripts were present between  <dig> to  <dig> and less than  <dig> copies ×  <dig> - <dig>  respectively. similarly, in nodules of the same inrat- <dig> plants, less than 1% of the transcripts were present in very high copy numbers . however, the number of transcripts in the different abundancy classes  varied to some extent. fifteen percent fell in between  <dig> and  <dig> copies ×  <dig> - <dig>  contrasting the 10% found in roots. transcripts detected in less than  <dig> copies ×  <dig> - <dig> made up ~ 85% of the total  <dig> bp tags. unitags from control and stress libraries were deposited in the gene expression omnibus  public domain under the series gse <dig> 

est-bridged annotation of unitags: mutualism between two profiling techniques
during the past years, the arrival of massive sequencing approaches enabled the sequencing of very large transcriptome portions for very favourable costs in relation to output. as a consequence, several groups have already started sequencing hundred thousands of complete cdnas for species from which almost no sequence information was available. to prove the potential of combining the high quantitative resolution of a tagging technique with the high sequence quality obtained by large mrna sequencing procedures, supersage libraries were annotated by linking unitags to the more than  <dig>  chickpea ests deposited in the public domain  <cit> . after unitag-linking, each est sequence was re-annotated to fabaceae and arabidopsis databases obtained from ncbi  and tigr .

from  <dig>  unitags ,  <dig>  found high homology matches with  <dig>  chickpea ests. through re-annotation of the ests to public databases, a total of  <dig>  unitags were assigned to  <dig>  uniprot characterized entries. a total of  <dig>  unitags were linked to gene ontology  terms .

concerning unitag-to-est representation,  <dig>  out of  <dig>  ests  were represented by a single unitag, whereas  <dig>  ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  where represented by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and > <dig> unitags, respectively. remarkably, the est targeted by the largest number of unitags was the contig <dig> . for the total dataset, a positive correlation was found between the cumulative number of unitag copies and the number of targeting unitags for a given target est . however, the distribution of copy numbers was not equal along all unitags grouped to the same est . large families usually showed a single unitag with high copy numbers accompanied by several similar tags found in much lower proportion .

snps-associated alternative tags in supersage libraries
to assess the unitags sequence similarity within chickpea supersage libraries without comparing to external ests, the datasets ca-i93-nacl-ct and ca-i93-nacl-str  were self-blasted via stand alone blast  <cit> . additionally, a supersage dataset from musa acuminata  was retrieved from the gene expression omnibus  and self-blasted  <cit> . in this way, groups of unitags sharing high sequence similarities were formed .

along the three evaluated supersage datasets, 70% of the unitags did not find high homologies  to any other unitag within the own library . in much lower proportions,  <dig>   <dig>  and 2% of the unitags, found one, two, and more than three similar hits, respectively, within the own libraries. several of the similar unitags belonging to the same family were differentiated by snps, a phenomenon already reported for humans, and known as snps-associated alternative tags   <cit> . an example of a large saat family of chickpea unitags is depicted in figure  <dig> 

diversity of expression profiles along saats
as exemplified in figure  <dig> through a family of  <dig> unitags annotated to a histone h <dig> protein , unitags associated to the same saat family very often showed different expression profiles and a very different distribution of copy numbers. for the exemplified case, unitag stca- <dig> showed the largest number of copies in all four libraries with a total of  <dig> . <dig> copies ×  <dig> - <dig>  whereas the remaining  <dig> unitags only added up to  <dig>  copies ×  <dig> - <dig>  remarkably, the majority of significant expression changes are seen in low copy number unitags. the present result emphasizes the complementarities of both supersage and other massive sequencing approaches. in supersage libraries all sequencing efforts are directed to a discrete region of a given est, thus gaining on resolution in a determined region, however, sacrificing the larger coverage that could be obtained through larger reads .

stress- and organ-related differential gene expression in chickpea roots and nodules
in roots of the salt-tolerant chickpea variety inrat- <dig>  35% of the  <dig> bp tags were at least  <dig> -fold up- or down-regulated , respectively, after only  <dig> hours of exposure to  <dig> mm nacl. from these, more than  <dig>  tags  were at least 8-fold down-regulated, a much higher proportion than the mere  <dig> %  showing more than 8-fold up-regulation in the same organ, and also, far more than the  <dig>  and  <dig> %  showing at least 8-fold down- or up-regulation in nodules of the same plants. with the highest up-regulation level, a  <dig> bp tag annotated to a putative basic pr <dig> precursor  was highly induced and most differentially expressed . an early nodulin class  <dig>  showed the second highest induction level. this is the first report of a dramatic induction of an enod <dig> gene in legumes under salt-stress. apart from its function in the early stages of nodule formation, enod40s may also modulate the action of auxin, and function as plant growth regulators altering phytohormone responses  <cit> .

the top  <dig> salt stress up-regulated transcripts from chickpea roots are deposited in table  <dig>  go slim  statistics for the corresponding uniprot accessions are depicted in figure  <dig> 

among the go slim terms  linked to the most up-regulated root unitags, oxidation-reduction occupied the highest rank, being represented by transcripts annotated to q9znq4_cicar , q9xer2_trirp , q9sml1_cicar , b7z177_pea and q43817_pea , q84ka1_crosa , and q40310_medsa . although not directly oxidation-reduction related, cellular ketone metabolic process was added to this group through association with lipoxygenases reported above and the accession q8w1a0_soybn . further on, the translation biological process was represented by a9txv0_phypa , q84u89_medsa , q7x9k1_wheat , and rla1_maize . these results suggest a strong activation of ros-scavenging mechanisms, a very well known event in stressed plant tissues, and deploy of the protein machinery as prime responses in the stressed roots. however, information based on only the top  <dig> up-regulated unitags should not be considered as representative for the whole transcriptome. in subsequent sections, representation-analysis of go terms, that take the expression level of the complete set of annotated unitags into account, will be assessed.

simultaneously with the analysis of whole-transcriptome responses to salt stress in roots, nodules of the same plants were separately harvested for the establishment of supersage libraries . in contrast to salt-stressed chickpea roots , only  <dig> and  <dig> unitags, respectively, were at least  <dig> -fold up- or down-regulated. the top  <dig> most up-regulated transcripts in chickpea nodules after  <dig> hours of salt stress are listed in table  <dig>  go slim  statistics for the corresponding uniprot accessions are depicted in figure  <dig> 

in comparison to roots of the same plants, highly expressed nodule transcripts originated from genes encoding tfs and transport-related proteins. among the represented go slim biological process in the most  <dig> up-regulated unitags in salt stressed nodules , transcription and regulation of biological processes were represented by the uniprot entries elof1_arath , c7afg1_cicar , q2pjr9_soybn , and phya_pea . the response to stimulus process was also represented by accessions like f10al_arath  and hsp12_medsa . further on, translation process was in turn represented by a9txv0_phypa , and q3lum5_goshi , whereas transport was represented by q94fn1_lotja , pma9_arath , nltp_cicar , a2q5z1_medtr , and q762a5_orysj .

in addition to the expression profiles under stress conditions, differentially expressed unitags in non-stressed nodules versus non-stressed roots from the same inrat- <dig> plants were as well detected. a total of  <dig>  tags from both untreated libraries represented  <dig>  different unitags. a total of  <dig>  unitags showed > <dig> -fold differential expression between both organs. of these,  <dig>  unitags with > <dig> -fold differential expression were more prevalent in nodules. with a higher threshold,  <dig> transcripts were more than  <dig> -fold prevalent in the symbiotic organs. all organ- and stress-related differentially expressed unitags along with their respective annotations are deposited in additional file  <dig> 

setting a minimum threshold of 3-fold differential expression, from the  <dig>   <dig> bp tags prevalent in non-stressed nodules,  <dig>  were also at least 3-fold up-regulated in roots under salt stress. these  <dig> unitags represented  <dig> % of the root transcripts >3-fold up-regulated by salt. on the other hand, only  <dig> out of the  <dig>  unitags were more than 3-fold up-regulated in salt-stressed nodules. in both salt-stressed roots and nodules,  <dig> common  <dig> bp tags were more than 3-fold up-regulated . as far as down-regulation is concerned,  <dig>  out of  <dig>  unitags prevalent in non-stressed roots were more than 3-fold down-regulated in roots after  <dig> h of salt treatment. a total of  <dig> tags were commonly more than 3-fold down-regulated in both roots and nodules under salt-stress.

if the threshold is set to 8-fold differential expression,  <dig> out of  <dig> tags prevalent in non-stressed nodules were more than 8-fold up-regulated in salt-stressed roots. upon salt stress in both organs,  <dig> unitags were commonly more than 8-fold up-regulated. on the other hand, no tags prevalent in non-stressed nodules were more than 8-fold up-regulated in the same organ upon salt stress .

four  <dig> bp tags were more than 20-fold differentially expressed between non-stressed nodules and roots. from these, no shared response with any >20-fold salt-induced root or nodule transcript was observed . annotatable tags shared by salt-stressed nodules and roots with a minimum threshold of 8-fold up-regulation in response to salt stress are listed in table  <dig> 

threshold in organ-wise differential expression: r  <dig>  

threshold in stress-treatment differential expression: r  <dig>  

global transcriptome differences in stressed roots and nodules
to uncover global differences between the root and nodule transcriptomes, gene score re-sampling analysis  for over-representation of go functional categories was carried out for the total annotated unitags from both organs. the gsr analysis was fed with the expression levels  of each unitag after stress induction. the go categories  undergoing the most significant changes in a stress- and organ-manner were then detected.

additional to standard go terms, two custom-made categories were introduced to the gsr analysis, following the procedure of gillis and co-workers  <cit> . over-representation within our data set from transcripts involved in the salt overly sensitive pathway , and ros-scavenging mechanisms  was in this way confirmed. genes belonging to both pathways were filtered from already enriched go terms and were re-entered into the analysis. a closer detail on both aspects will be assessed on the discussion section.

in chickpea roots from control and salt-treated libraries, a total of  <dig>  unitags were associated to gene ontology  terms. after gsr analysis of  <dig> biological processes, a total of  <dig> terms were over-represented with . from them,  <dig> biological processes were over-represented with very high significance . a graphical overview of the gsr results for salt stressed chickpea roots, along with the most significant over-represented go categories and their representation in nodules of the same plants is depicted in figure  <dig> 

not surprisingly, signal-related processes like go terms go: <dig> , go: <dig> , and go: <dig>  were over represented. transport categories like go: <dig>  and go: <dig>  were also highly significant. among the metabolism-related processes, lipid metabolism-related categories  interestingly reacted upon salt stress. concerning protein homeostasis, terms related to transport , folding , localization , and catabolism  also showed p < 1e- <dig> values.

diverse response-related terms with different significance levels were also detected. as an example, go term go: <dig>  was represented by  <dig> uniprot accessions, showing highly significant over-representation , whereas go term go: <dig>  showed a lower significance level . globally, from  <dig> response-related terms,  <dig> were over-represented with at least p < 1e- <dig>  additionally, quite as expected, sos- and ros-custom categories resulted over-represented with 

nodules of the same inrat- <dig> plants differed from roots in their global transcriptome remodelling level after stress induction. from the  <dig> analysable terms,  <dig> go terms were over represented with . with higher significance levels,  <dig> and  <dig> biological processes showed p values of  and , respectively. ten of the go terms with very high significance  were also over-represented in roots of the same plants. depending on the organ, some sets of different uniprot accessions were associated with each go term. a clear example is the go term go: <dig> . in roots,  <dig> uniprot accessions were associated to this term, whereas only  <dig> were associated in nodules. from them,  <dig> were not common to both organs . another example is go: <dig> , which is represented by  <dig> and  <dig> uniprot accessions in roots and nodules, respectively. from them,  <dig> showed either nodule- or root-specific association.

concerning processes more induced in stressed nodules while showing no significant representation level in roots, the terms go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig> , and go: <dig>  revealed the highest contrasts . on the other hand,  <dig> terms were more represented in stressed roots, among them, the sos-custom category). from them,  <dig> terms showed  and  over-representation significances in stressed roots and nodules, respectively . a complete matrix with all analysed processes along with their significance levels of over-representation, and the associated uniprot entries for the different organs and stress conditions are deposited in additional file  <dig> 

nodule over-represented go biological processes under control conditions
to reveal global transcriptome differences in both organs under control conditions, the differential expression of unitags from untreated nodules compared to roots was calculated, and the fold changes were fed into gsr analysis. in non-stressed tissues, the levels of significance for over-representation estimated by the erminej package were substantially lower compared to the ones observed in salt stressed roots and nodules. in control conditions, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> go biological processes were more prevalent in nodules with  and , respectively .

interestingly,  <dig> of the go biological processes prevalent in nodules  were over-represented in salt stressed roots at very high significance levels . protein machinery- , lipid metabolism- , and general metabolism-related  terms were among these common processes. from  <dig> go terms prevalent in nodules with ,  <dig> were over-represented in salt-stressed nodules with the same significance threshold. among these common processes, highest on the rank of over-representation in control nodules, the ros custom category showed a significance of . all common over-represented go biological processes in untreated nodules and salt-stressed roots are summarized in table  <dig> 

information transfer from unitag profiles to other platforms
in situ visualization of two ascorbate peroxidase  transcripts in chickpea nodules
to test the transferability of information between unitag profiles and other platforms, selected nodule-metabolism-associated transcripts were localized in chickpea nodules. for this purpose, in situ pcrs of ascorbate peroxidase-annotated unitags were performed in nodule slices. main features of the anatomy of chickpea nodules are depicted in figure  <dig> 

transcripts from the ascorbate peroxydase  <dig>  gene were detected mostly in the inner cortex and less in the outer cortex of control nodules  . two hours after exposure to  <dig> mm nacl, the transcripts accumulated to high levels in the outer cortex . note, that the negative controls did not show any fluorescent signal. in contrast, only few transcripts from the apx <dig> gene appear in control root nodules, whereas the number of transcripts highly increased both in the inner and the outer cortex after exposure to salinity .

ascorbate peroxidase  is a key enzyme that scavenges potentially harmful h2o <dig> and thus prevents oxidative damage especially in n2-fixing legume root nodules. in fact, nodules have a high capacity to generate activated forms of o <dig> such as h2o <dig>  because of the relatively high rates of respiration during the early response to moderate salt stress. the elevated levels of transcripts encoding ros scavengers in the outer and inner cortex, like apx <dig> in our study, point to a critical role of these regions in ros-scavenging, thereby counteracting by-products of respiration caused by leakage of the electron transport chain. therefore, elevated levels of apx would be required to provide adequate antioxidant defence. although nodules possess an array of antioxidant metabolites and enzymes that prevent the generation of highly oxidizing radicals  and hence the damage of lipids, proteins, and dna, to name some. in addition, antioxidants regulate the intracellular concentrations of reactive oxygen species, such as the superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide , that are signalling stress perception and activating stress-responsive genes  <cit> .

quantification of oxylipin-related unitags via qpcr
the gsr analysis in salt-stressed chickpea roots and nodules revealed lipid-metabolism associated categories among the stress over-represented go biological processes . lipoxygenases and other oxylipin-related uniprot accessions belong to genes  most frequently associated with the respective go terms .

oxidized fatty acids, known as oxylipins, are compounds tightly linked to ros metabolism and stress responses in plants  <cit> . these compounds, which are generated by the coordinated action of lipases, lipoxygenases, and some cytochrome p <dig> enzymes, are key elements of jasmonic acid  biosynthesis. ja represents a signalling molecule, that, apart from stress responses, is also involved in developmental processes  <cit> . a set of oxylipin-related transcripts was selected and confirmed by qrt-pcr, and their expression levels were compared in different chickpea varieties. among more than  <dig>  surveyed transcripts,  <dig> unitags annotated to lipoxygenases were distributed over  <dig> saats families and annotated to  <dig> different uniprot accessions. these unitags varied their expression levels from 5fold down- to 25fold up-regulation   <dig> h after onset of salt stress in chickpea roots.

allene oxide cyclase  is an enzyme involved in ja biosynthesis by catalysing the conversion of fatty acid hydroxyperoxides to 12-oxophytodienoic acid   <cit> . in chickpea roots and nodules, five unitags could be annotated to two aos uniprot accessions. expression levels for the respective unitags varied from 4-fold up-regulation to 20-fold down regulation.

comparative qrt-pcr assays using rnas from chickpea varieties inrat- <dig> , amdoun <dig> , icc- <dig> , and icc- <dig>  confirmed the deepsupersage data of selected unitags  <dig> h after salt stress in inrat- <dig>  additionally, marked differences in expression levels were detected as compared to other varieties with lower salt tolerance. a good example is the aos-annotated transcript stca- <dig> . after comparing the expression of the same aos transcript via qrt-pcr  in inrat- <dig>  icc- <dig>  and icc- <dig>  much higher expression levels were detected in inrat- <dig> .

concerning up-regulated transcripts of the salt-tolerant variety inrat- <dig>  cases in which the level of up-regulation was still higher in a salt-sensitive variety were also observed. as an example, the lipoxygenase-annotated  <dig> bp tag stca- <dig>  which is  <dig> -fold up-regulated under salt stress in inrat- <dig>  is much stronger up-regulated in salt-sensitive amdoun <dig>  this suggests that some of the stress-related genes "over-react" in salt-sensitive plants, which may account for the differences between salt-tolerant and -sensitive varieties . supersage and qrt-pcr expression profiles of the selected genes in the tested varieties are deposited in additional file  <dig> 

confirmation of supersage expression profiles by microarray hybridization
supersage libraries were developed from chickpea plants exposed to other abiotic stresses such as cold  and drought stress  <cit> . from these, a selection of approximately  <dig>   <dig> bp tags with diverse regulation levels were spotted onto an agilent™ 16k micro-array  as  <dig> bp oligonucleotides . for each spotted  <dig> bp tag, similar oligos carrying mismatches were additionally spotted onto the array in three sets as follows: i) mismatch at position 7; ii) mismatches at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively; and iii) mismatches at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. microarray design followed a previous report  <cit> . after background correction using the intensities of the oligos carrying mismatches, dye swapping, and statistical treatment, the expression ratios  from a selection of  <dig>  <dig> bp oligos were compared with the original deepsupersage profiles. although any comparison of such different profiling platforms is hampered by the differences in signal magnitudes, the almost unavoidable cross-hybridization signals on micro-arrays, the sequence similarity between some spotted  <dig> bp tags with contrasting regulation levels, and the relatively short size of the spotted oligos , a shared tendency towards up- or down-regulation of transcripts of  <dig> % was observed between both platforms .

discussion
transcripts abundance and occurrence of snps-associated alternative tags
the tag copy numbers within the present chickpea deepsupersage libraries reveal that a substantial proportion of the sampled transcripts is present at low abundance . this observation is not at all new for plants. in sage-based transcriptome analyses in arabidopsis and maize, at least 70% of the detected transcripts  were of low abundance  <cit> . in several other organisms outside the plant kingdom , large differences between abundant and rare transcripts have also been observed  <cit> .

it is not clear why this proportion of low copy number transcripts is so big in many transcriptomes. it has been suggested that transcripts found in high abundance represent a limited number of house-keeping genes, whereas "rare" transcripts are derived from genes with more specialized functions  <cit> . in other cases, transcripts encoding proteins with the same function can also display very different ranges of copy numbers  <cit> .

chickpea root and nodule low copy number unitags belong to diverse functional categories comprising signalling-, general metabolism-, transcription regulation-, and protein machinery-related biological processes . moreover, we observed that some low copy number unitags accompany high copy number saats. future studies can profit from the information generated in the present work, where more than  <dig>  chickpea low copy number transcripts variants are potential candidates for further validation.

concerning sequence similarity, more than  <dig>  unitags derived from chickpea roots and nodules were analyzed, permitting to follow the expression dynamics of equivalent  <dig>  hypothetical complete transcripts. however, how redundant is the original mrna population, and what level of variation is observed between transcripts, still remain questions to further explore. we have observed that around 70% of the transcripts contained in a certain chickpea library are different to each other, whereas the remaining 30% can form families of very similar  <dig> bp tags, many of them with contrasting expression profiles. up to date, no extensive study of this phenomenon in plants exists, that could be exploited for the explanation of the observed results. however, in humans, as exemplarily reported for cancer cells, tags generated by sage-related techniques are very often differentiated from each other only by snps  <cit> . extensive studies in which the tag-to-transcript assignment has been approached in deep resolution show that snp-associated alternative tags  were observed for nearly  <dig> % of all known human genes. additionally, from all analyzed transcripts,  <dig> % harbored a snp contiguous to a terminal nlaiii  recognition site  <cit> .

considering the appearance of very similar transcripts in an organism, the occurrence of snps within ests in humans has been associated to the high flexibility of the transcriptome that allows the generation of varying transcript "isoforms" from a single genomic locus, a phenomenon also reported in arabidopsis  <cit> . in several cases these small sequence differences have been associated to changes in rna stability and/or decay rate, translation rates, cell- and tissue-localization, and stability of the produced protein  <cit> .

the present study delivers valuable information from more than  <dig>  chickpea transcripts that present small sequence variations, and nevertheless very different expression levels under salt stress conditions. future studies in which finer tissue- or cell type-resolution is achieved may profit from the present data, and answer several questions, that up to now remain open.

salt stress-induced differential gene expression in chickpea roots
after analysis of more than  <dig>   <dig> bp tags from chickpea roots, unitag stca- <dig>  represented the most up-regulated transcript in salt-treated chickpea roots with a more than 70fold up-regulation. proteins of this family have previously been associated to defense responses and plant stress . apart from stca- <dig> ,  <dig> similar alternative unitags are annotated to the same est . although it is known that the encoded proteins are most probably involved in extracellular signaling, no targets or activators are known. the present results expand our knowledge of pr1-related proteins and delivers already  <dig> transcript isoforms with different abundance levels.

further down the list of top up-regulated unitags, at least three uniprot accessions associated to ros-scavenging and redox homeostasis are found, represented by unitags annotated to one superoxide dismutase , two lipoxyenases , and one alternative oxidase . reports on high activity of ros-related genes under stress are already known from plants, an aspect that has been extensively reviewed elsewhere  <cit> . however, to extract transcript populations for candidates with pronounced stress responses is a crucial task. as an example, transcript profiles of at least further  <dig> lipoxygenase-annotated transcripts are reported here .

related to genes from other functional categories, trypsin inhibitors rapidly accumulate in plants under salt, drought, high aluminum stress, wounding, fungal infection, and aba and jasmonate applications  <cit> . particularly in the first stages of salt stress response in rice, various trypsin inhibitor isoforms are very active  <cit> . extensin proteins are generally involved in cell-wall modifications to counteract mechanical pressures arising from differences in water potential  <cit> . although dormancy-associated proteins are salt stress-induced in m. truncatula, very little is known about their exact functions  <cit> . as growth-promoting phytohormones, auxins function in the regulation of root development in salt-stressed plants  <cit> . therefore, the over-expression of unitag stca- <dig>  in salt-treated inrat- <dig> roots may be linked to auxin activity and root growth regulation. reports on the activity of the nadp+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase  in the facultative halophyte mesembryanthemum crystallinum already highlighted the importance of this protein under salt stress  <cit> . however, contrasting the results for chickpea, the activity of icdh increased in leaves, and decreased in roots in m. crystallinum. acetyl-coa synthetase , a key enzyme in acetate production, does not seem to be involved in the management of osmotic or ionic stress. only one study is known, in which acetate production levels and the activities of acs and aldehyde dehydrogenase  were monitored under hyperosmotic conditions  <cit> . also, informations about the role of cysteine synthases in plants under salt stress are rather limited. however, apart from its general role in protein biosynthesis and as a sulfur donor, cysteine is one of the main components of the anti-oxidant glutathione   <cit> . glutamate and ascorbate are the major redox buffers in plants, representing the ascorbate/glutathione cycle  <cit> .

any one-by-one listing of all the up- or down-regulated transcripts under certain conditions is not efficient when high-throughput technologies are used, where thousands of genes are monitored in parallel. to date, several approaches overcome the handling of big data masses to extract biological meaning. in the present work, the accumulated large information body has been filtered combining the output of gsr  analysis with literature and metabolic pathways available in public domains. in subsequent sections, a few relevant biological processes will be dissected in some detail.

up regulated transcripts in salt stressed nodules and common nodule-root responses
in the present work, the transcription profile of more than  <dig>  nodule unitags has been deciphered. several functional categories were represented among the most up regulated unitags, from which a good portion was also up-regulated in salt-stressed roots of the same plants. several of the underlying genes have been already identified as being stress-responsive in plants, and also in legumes, as is the case with genes encoding alternative oxidases , lipoxygenases, map kinases, cytochrome c oxidases  <cit> , transcription elongation factors, and phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins  <cit> . all of them representing proteins involved in widely studied signalling and oxidative stress counteraction processes.

other highly up-regulated, but less known genes deserve attention as potential candidates for further characterization. examples are genes encoding agglutinins, proteins whose activity under osmotic stress is only known from few plant studies  <cit> . annotated to proteins of this class, unitag stca- <dig>  was 13- and 18-fold up-regulated in salt stressed chickpea nodules and roots, respectively. another case is the high salt tress induction of mob1-annotated transcripts in chickpea roots and nodules. the involvement of mob proteins in plant cytokinesis and growth has been studied in detail, yet no connection to stress responses has been reported  <cit> . in chickpea roots and nodules, mob1-annotated unitags stca- <dig> and stca- <dig> are at least 8-fold up-regulated in both organs under salt stress, and both unitags are accompanied by  <dig> saats, many of them showing contrasting expression profiles.

even less characterized are plant fiber proteins like fb <dig>  from which only few functional data are available up to date . contrary to several other highly stress-induced transcripts in chickpea roots and nodules, fb <dig> proteins are represented by only one single unitag , without any related saat. however, we could annotate further  <dig> unitags to at least six other fb classes.

as described above, the present results encompass sets of transcript variants derived from previously described genes together with their expression profiles and sequences . although a compilation of stress-regulated genes is not new, the present information on the dynamics of their transcript variants in chickpea roots and nodules merits attention.

also, an important objective in high-throughput transcriptomics is the discovery of new genes. among the highly stress up-regulated  unitags from chickpea nodules and roots , five unitags were annotated to ests with no homology to any characterized plant mrna or genic dna sequences. these ests showed no significant blastx complete hits to proteins deposited in the public domain. the respective unitag- and complete chickpea target ests-sequences from unannotated transcripts are deposited in additional file  <dig> 

cross-feedback of go representation analysis and abiotic stress-related pathways
handling the large masses of data derived from high-throughput transcriptome studies implies extensive filtering of information. in the present study, gsr over-representation analysis of go categories provided a view of the global transcriptome of chickpea roots and nodules and its remodelling under stress. however, instead of defining discrete pathways, go terms group genes or proteins according to their associated biological process, cell components, or molecular functions . so we re-screened the output of our gsr analysis to monitor the dynamics of transcripts associated with pathways represented in certain go categories. here, two stress-related processes are discussed in detail, i) the regulation of cellular na+ homeostasis, and ii) counteraction of reactive oxygen species . although these two processes are widely studied in plants, a detailed search for potential pathway members, their transcript isoforms and their expression profiles, is still missing in several non-model crops  <cit> .

na+ homeostasis and potential salt overly sensitive  members in chickpea
in plants, the salt-sensitive-overly  pathway partly manages the excess of na+ ions under saline stress conditions by the interplay of calcineurin b-like  ca2+ sensors with cbl-interacting protein kinases , that regulate directly the activity of the sos <dig> protein , and indirectly, a broad array of proton pumps   <cit> . additionally to sos <dig> to  <dig>  sos <dig> and sos <dig> proteins have been identified to interact with the other sos members. sos <dig> encodes a pyridoxal  kinase, whereas sos <dig> encodes a polypeptide partly homologous to proteins of the arabinogalactan class   <cit> .

the sos cascade has been initially studied in detail in arabidopsis knock-out mutants, and later on also in other plants like rice, poplar, and several brassica species  <cit> . in salt stressed chickpea roots, after a cross-fed screening between the gsr results and sos pathway members, four highly over-represented  biological processes revealed to contain potential members of the sos cascade among their associated gene accessions. go terms: go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig> , and go: <dig> .

here we report a set of  <dig> and  <dig> chickpea unitags annotated to at least  <dig> and  <dig> cipks and cbls, respectively. these unitags revealed diverse expression levels in a range between 24-fold down- and 7-fold up-regulation in salt-stressed roots, and 4-fold down- and 6-fold up-regulation in nodules, respectively. to our knowledge, no potential members of this pathway are yet known in both chickpea organs. additionally, at least  <dig> unitags distributed in  <dig> similar tag families  were annotated to proton pump atpases, proteins which can be controlled by the sos network  <cit> . concerning sos <dig> and sos <dig>  only a single unitag annotated to a pyridoxal kinase was detected , whereas  <dig> unitags distributed in five saat families where annotated to agps. a summary of the unitags representing the distinct cbls, cipks, and agps is deposited in table  <dig>  complete sequences of the respective homologous chickpea ests are deposited in additional file  <dig>  these transcripts may serve as starting point for validation of their function in chickpea.

ros management in salt stressed chickpea roots and nodules
the production and management of reactive oxygen species  are major early events of the stress response in plants, and consequently these features are enriched among over-represented go terms in chickpea. ros-scavenging is well-known from several stress contexts in plants, and therefore we will not repeat informations here  <cit> . however, filtering of the present dataset for transcript variants encoding proteins involved in ros-related processes should identify candidate ests for further characterization.

as a response of plants to ros overproduction arising from stress-induced metabolic imbalance, dismutation of superoxide  radicals by sod occurs very quickly  <cit> . a total of  <dig> unitags annotated to  <dig> sod uniprot entries were detected in the inrat- <dig> root and nodule dataset. from them, two saat families each with four unitags were detected, whereas the remaining unitags showed  <dig>  or no associated saat. belonging to one of the four-saat families, stca- <dig> was the most differentially expressed sod unitag under salt stress .

after dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide , catalases , ascorbate peroxidases , dehydroascorbate reductases , glutathione peroxidases , glutathione reductases , and glutathione-s-transferases  finish the h2o <dig> scavenging process via the ascorbate and glutathione cycles  <cit> . in salt stressed chickpea roots and nodules, diverse expression profiles were revealed by unitags annotated to these enzymes. several of these transcripts are very active in nodules even before the onset of the stress, probably due to the high metabolic activity of these chickpea organs  <cit> . a total of  <dig> unitags annotated to proteins belonging to the ascorbate and glutathione cycles were detected in the present dataset. an overview of the plant genes involved in basic ros-scavenging mechanisms along with the unitag transcript levels in salt-stressed roots and nodules is depicted in figure  <dig>  fold-regulation, annotation to anonymous chickpea ests, sequences, and information on copy numbers per supersage library for the above detailed pathways are accessible through the filtering options on additional file  <dig> 

up-regulation of stress-related transcripts in non-treated chickpea nodules
one of the most interesting features observed on the present chickpea supersage profiles relies on the fact that several unitags found to be prevalent in untreated nodules, become highly induced in roots after salt stress. here,  <dig> and  <dig> unitags resulted nodule-prevalent and salt up-regulated in roots with 3- and 8-fold differential expression thresholds, respectively. results that were corroborated by the gsr analysis, where at least  <dig> go biological processes prevalent in untreated nodules are also over-represented in stressed roots .

to spot an example, the high representation of genes related to ros-scavenging in non-stressed chickpea nodules, like sods, can be explained by the metabolic demands from the nitrogen fixing machinery, whereas in salt stressed roots the high sods induction could be triggered by a general ionic disequilibrium  <cit> . whether this type of early induction presents any help for the plant to overcome any oncoming stress is an interesting question, not only for ros-scavengers, but for several other categories showing similar tendencies in chickpea roots and nodules.

previous works on poplar plants colonized by ectomycorrhizas  have already suggested that the symbiotic partnership acts as stress pre-priming event, conferring better salt stress performance to em-colonized plants. through a combined transcriptome and metabolome approach, luo and co workers identified a series of common up regulated genes between em-colonized and salt stressed poplar roots  <cit> . in a parallel work on drought-stressed poplar, beniwal and co-workers found similar results  <cit> . on both cases, the better stress performance of em-colonized plants involved genes acting on signal- and stress related-pathways as well as genes involved in growth and tissue structural modifications.

despite large differences in the type of symbiotic association, plant families, and experimental conditions, a set of  <dig> genes sharing the same tendencies in chickpea and poplar was filtered out. main features are deposited in table  <dig>  this set of genes involves ros-, general metabolism-, nitrogen compounds transport-, and cell structure-related biological processes. the represented transcripts can be taken as candidates for further characterisation. the present work delivers already information about their expression profiles, transcript isoforms, and homologous high quality ests sequences.

information transfer from supersage to other platforms
previous reports already capitalized on the transfer of sequence information from supersage to microarrays platforms  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> bp oligos with unitag sequences were directly spotted onto agilent®-16k arrays. in general, the signal background levels were relatively high, leading to loss of information. nevertheless, after comparing the results from the 16k agilent arrays with supersage profiles, a high proportion of transcripts  showed shared regulation tendencies . however, the signal intensities on the array did not correlate completely with the supersage expression ratios. therefore, microarray and supersage results were confirming each other , but were not congruent in the degree of differential expression.

one of the major drawbacks for the transfer of information from sage-based techniques to cdna chips is the loss of resolution. whereas very similar transcripts could be differentiated in silico by supersage, this degree of differentiation can present problems for hybridization-based techniques  <cit> . at present, diverse technologies have already been applied for the detection of snps on microarrays. however, these approaches are more directed towards genotyping than to expression profiling  <cit> . additionally, low-abundant transcripts represent another big obstacle in the use of supersage-based microarrays. as reported for human neuronal tissue with a transcriptome full of low-abundant mrnas, the power of microarrays is limited when "rare" messages are evaluated  <cit> . in the present study, most of the spotted  <dig> bp tags were selected on the basis of their up- or down-regulation, implying that their copy numbers are relatively high. therefore, the microarray-based profiles do not monitor tags of low abundance. despite the relatively good tendency congruence in both techniques for the analyzed transcripts, these drawbacks emphasize, that better strategies are still needed to improve the transference of information from deepsupersage expression profiling to hybridization-based platforms.

parallel to microarray spotting, the sequence information from the  <dig> bp tags was used as starting point to generate qpcr and in situ pcr amplifiable fragments via 3'- and 5'-race . in few cases, race amplifications using the unitag as starting sequence produced more than one product, which in many of the cases reflect the same homology with est accessions shown by the original unitags. race amplification of alternative, but similar ests is a quite common phenomenon, that could be responsible for the appearance of snp-associated alternative tags  in large sage databases  <cit> . despite these technical difficulties, we transferred deepsupersage-derived information to qpcr and in situ pcr with satisfactory results. however, hundreds or thousands of assays would be needed for a real estimation of the transfer efficiency.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, deepsupersage allowed to profile the transcription of genes coding for proteins involved in ros scavenging and control of high na+ levels, among many other relevant biological processes, in various situations . the major insights into the prime steps of salt stress response observed in chickpea are: 1) part of the chickpea transcriptome is highly expressed in nodules already under control conditions, and a portion of it becomes highly up regulated in roots only after stress induction. 2) ros-scavengers are highly represented among transcripts displaying this regulation tendency. this rapid activation of genes in response to salt stress was yet unknown in nodulating legumes. however, the stress-priming effect induced by symbiotic nitrogen-fixing organisms is already known from other systems, as reported for ectomycorrhizal colonization in poplar plants under saline stress  <cit> .

for the first time at all, the magnitude of the organ- and stress-specific transcriptomes was assessed in chickpea roots and nodules. for more than  <dig>  unique transcripts recovered from both organs, a clear organ-prevalence could be detected, and a stress-response level starting from  <dig> -fold and going up to 20-fold differential expression was revealed.

the present report witnesses the potential of the high-throughput deepsupersage technology coupled to one of the next-generation sequencing platforms  for a genome-wide quantitative gene expression profiling of plants or plant organs under stress.
