BACKGROUND
many large-scale biological networks, including metabolic networks   <cit> , signaling networks  <cit> , transcriptional regulatory networks  <cit>  and transcriptional and translational networks  <cit>  have been reconstructed along with the development of high-throughput technology in the past decades. these networks are then transformed into mathematical models for further analysis. constraint-based reconstruction and analysis  is one of the most commonly used frameworks introduced to model and analyze steady-state biochemical networks  <cit> . in the past two decades, it has been successfully applied on mns to study various phenotypes  <cit> . recently, the same principles were also extended to other types of biochemical networks mentioned above  <cit> .

all the possible phenotypes, i.e. the flux distributions of feasible steady states, of a constraint-based biochemical model form a high-dimensional cone. network-based pathways such as extreme pathways   <cit>  are defined to study this cone. expas are vectors of fluxes that lie on the edges of the cone  <cit> . they constitute the minimal and unique vector set which generates the space of all feasible steady states through non-negative linear combination. since expas characterize the limits on the capabilities of a cell's metabolic system  <cit> , expa analysis will reveal systemic properties of metabolism  <cit> . expa analysis as an approach to characterize the fundamental and time-invariant topological properties of a given network  <cit>  has been successfully applied to mns, such as those of human red blood cells  <cit> , escherichia coli  <cit> , sacchoromryces cerevisiae  <cit> , helicobacter pylori  <cit> , haemophilus influenzae  <cit>  and methylobacterium extroguens  <cit> . besides, network models respectively describing a prototypic signaling system  <cit>  and the jak-stat signaling system in the human b-cell  <cit>  have also been studied through expa analysis.

recently, there emerged two cobra models of biochemical systems with different types: e.coli transcriptional regulatory network   <cit>  and e.coli transcriptional and translational network   <cit> . what should be clarified is whether expa analysis is still useful for new types of networks and whether expas of trn or ttn show some properties different from those of mn. these questions are biologically significant because the answers determines whether we can rely on the existing analysis approaches to obtain novel and biologically meaningful findings in a brand new field. in this paper, we try to provide an anwser by comparing properties of expas among the e.coli trn, mn and ttn. in the comparison, differences between biological processes were observed from multiple perspectives, including network structure, reaction participation, specificity and redundancy. the results indicate that expa analysis can be extended to biochemical systems of trn and ttn, which helps researchers to further understand the corresponding biological systems. besides an improved method was introduced to simplify the calculation and interpretation of expas on trn models  <cit> , which could also be useful.

RESULTS
firstly, we calculated extreme pathways of the three biological networks mentioned above. since the number of expas grows exponentially with a networks' complexity  <cit> , the enumeration of expas on the highly complex ones such as e.coli mn and ttn is computationally intractable. fortunately expa calculation will be much more manageable if a mn or a ttn is divided into smaller sub-networks. therefore, we chose the sub-networks with relatively complete and independent functions as the representatives of their belonging biologic systems. for the e.coli mn, two sub-networks were chosen:  amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism  and  membrane and murein metabolism . for e.coli ttn, the two sub-networks were:  transcription  and  translation .

then expa analysis was performed on each network/subnetwork and the properties from different aspects were obtained, including the total number of expas, the number-based ratio of expa to reaction, expa length distribution, reaction participation distribution, correlated reaction sets , and the inter-connectivity of expas. finally, a horizontal comparison on the properties was made among the five networks/subnetworks.

moreover, some incompleteness and incorrectness in the e.coli trn model which were stumbled through expa analysis are also reported in this section. this findings illustrate that expa analysis is capable of directing model refinement.

e.coli trn model
the e.coli trn model was published by gianchandani et al. in  <dig>  <cit> . it contains  <dig> environmental stimuli,  <dig> transcriptional factors and  <dig> downstream target genes which are represented in a matrix r* <cit> . the trn model was improved to enhance the efficiency of expa calculation . the final trn model contains  <dig> components,  <dig> internal regulatory reactions, and  <dig> exchange reactions each corresponding to a component. all the extracellular metabolites were considered as inputs and all protein products were considered as outputs. there were  <dig> expas, of which  <dig> were biologically infeasible because they employed conflicting input fluxes, and thus they were excluded from the expa set used in analysis.

in e.coli trn,  <dig> reactions do not participate in any expa; namely they are never used to form a transcriptional state of the network. these unused reactions were categorized into two types as listed in table  <dig> and table  <dig> respectively.

not_bira represents the regulatory reaction that leads to the inhibition of gene transcription generating bira. '-' in the second column represents the deficiency of corresponding regulatory rules in the model.

leu-l>0
>0) and >0)
>0) and >0) and >0)
>0) and >0)
crp appears in the second column is a transcription factor and others are extracellular metabolites. the contradictory regulatory rules are labeled with shade in the table and these reactions never occur.

reactions in table  <dig> all relate to not_bira . however, no regulatory rule corresponds to the presence or absence of bira, and therefore, the initial steps are unknown. as a result, the internal reactions using not_bira  and the corresponding exchange reactions  will never be initiated. furthermore, proteins bira and the gene products of b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> do not participate in any other reaction except those in table  <dig>  so their invalidation will not affect other reactions in the network. in a word, these  <dig> reactions do not participate in any expa because their relevant reactions  are unavailable in the network. the unused reactions in table  <dig> show the incompleteness of the e.coli trn model and necessitate further refinement.

for the reactions in table  <dig>  the regulatory rule of b <dig> can be divided by simple logical transformation into  <dig> rules, of which  <dig> contradict with each other . since there are still  <dig> operational regulatory rules relating to the transcription of b <dig>  its corresponding exchange reaction can be initiated. similarly, the regulatory rules of b <dig> and b <dig> are both contradictory and cannot be used in any expa. these reactions may imply some incorrect information in the model. therefore, new biological knowledge is needed to improve e.coli trn.

e.coli mn and ttn model
the mn model of e.coli k- <dig> mg <dig>  iaf <dig>  was published by feist et al, in  <dig>  <cit> . it includes the activities of  <dig> open reading frames . it consists of  <dig> metabolites and  <dig> reactions. the e.coli ttn model was published by thiele et al. in  <dig>  <cit> . it consists of  <dig> components and  <dig> reactions which give rise to  <dig> functional gene products  <cit> . given the critical inherent problem of combinatorial explosion during expa calculation, e.coli mn and ttn were divided into small sub-networks depending on the reactions' functions  <cit> . sub-networks as representatives of important biological processes were chosen.

the e.coli mn was divided into  <dig> discrete sub-networks with different functions: one for exchange reactions which transfer metabolites in and out of the metabolic system and the others for internal reactions. each reaction was assigned to one of the six sub-networks, whose details are listed in table  <dig>  two sub-networks, amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism  and membrane and murein metabolism , lie in the central part of e.coli mn and form the basis of other biological processes, and therefore they were chosen as the representatives of e.coli mn for expa analysis.

the e.coli ttn model comprises of  <dig> biological processes and the details are provided in  <cit> . each process was treated as a discrete sub-network. the largest two sub-networks, transcription and translation, were chosen for further expa analysis.

expa counting
the total numbers of expas and the number-based ratios of expa to reaction  are listed in table  <dig>  p/r depicts the proportionality of the numbers of expas and reactions in a network. table  <dig> shows that the p/rs of sacl  and smm  are much higher than those of trn , stc  and stl , which are a consequence of the linear structures of trns and ttns  <cit> . in contrast, mns are in more complex interconnection with a large number of alternative pathways, and thus their p/rs are much higher. the redundancy of expas increases a metabolic system's flexibility and fitness to sudden environmental changes  <cit> . these results illustrate the fundamental differences in topological structure and redundancy among the three types of networks.

abbreviations for subsystems: trn, transcriptional regulation; sacl, amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism; smm, membrane and murein metabolism; stc, transcription; stl, translation.

expa length
the length of an expa equals to the number of reactions that participate in it  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the histograms of expa length distribution for each network/ sub-network above. the details are listed in table  <dig> 

abbreviations for subsystems: trn, transcriptional regulation; sacl, amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism; smm, membrane and murein metabolism; stc, transcription; stl, translation. 'most' represents the expa length with the highest frequency. l/r ratio is the ratio of average expa length to reaction amount.

the length distributions of expas corresponding to those biological processes are very diverse. the longest expas consists  <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and  <dig> reactions in sacl, smm, stc and stl, respectively, which is much longer than that in trn . reactions in e.coli trn represent transcriptional regulatory rules rather than real biochemical reactions as in mn and ttn, and thus the expa length in trn depicts the number of regulatory rules used for expressing certain genes. a regulatory rule describes how environmental stimuli affect transcriptional factors, which in turn affect downstream target genes. therefore, the expa in trn is reasonably shorter as the biological network has a relatively flat hierarchical structure  <cit> . given the number of reactions, the ratio of average expa length to reaction number  was calculated for each biological network or subnetwork . the l/rs of the two representatives in mn are higher than those in trn and their counterparts in ttn. since expas convert substrates into products, expa length relates to how many reaction steps are needed to carry out the corresponding function. expa length can be characterized as the size and complexity of the corresponding flux distribution map  <cit> . the results indicate that the flux distribution map in mn is much more complex than those in trn and ttn.

reaction participation
the reaction participation rate  is defined as the percentage of expas in which a given reaction participates  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the distribution of rprs for each biological network/sub-network. most reactions participate in less than 10% of expas, especially in trn, stc and stl, but a few active reactions participate in many expas. although the high-rpr reactions are most exchange reactions, some of them are internal reactions which usually play a more important role in determining the phenotypic potentials of the five biological processes. given this, rpr can be reasonably considered as a metric for evaluating the importance of a reaction to implement the corresponding biological function  <cit> .

here the top  <dig> internal reactions with the highest rprs of each process are sorted in a descending order . several reactions of vital importance were found, and representatives were chosen for detailed study.

in trn, the two most active reactions crp_noglc_ <dig> and crp_ <dig> relate to the regulation rules of the transcription factor  c-reactive protein . other high rank reactions fis_ <dig>  lrp_ <dig>  fnr_ <dig>  and not_arca_ <dig> relate to the regulation rules of the tcfs fis, lrp, fnr and arca, respectively. in e.coli, the above tcfs belong to the seven global regulators that control most of the regulated genes  <cit> . the reaction not_cra_ <dig> is relevant to the regulation rules of the tcf cra, a pleiotropic regulatory protein that controls carbon and energy fluxes in enteric bacteria  <cit> . the reaction not_pdhr_ <dig> concerns the regulation rules of pdhr, a tcf that controls the respiratory electron transport system in e.coli. its regulation target, the pyruvate dehydrogenase  multienzyme complex, plays a key role in the metabolic interconnection between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle  <cit> .

in sacl, the most active reaction is aspta. it transfers oxoglutarate and aspartate to corresponding ketoacid, which are indispensable in glyoxylate cycle, an anabolic metabolic pathway occurring in e. coli  <cit> . the second one is asad which is the second step in the biosynthesis of amino acids in prokaryotes, fungi, and some higher plants. asad forms an early branch point in the metabolic pathway producing lysine, methionine, leucine and isoleucine from aspartate as well as diaminopimelate which plays an essential role in bacterial cell wall formation  <cit> . deletion of gene asd  is lethal to the organism as demonstrated by experiments with legionella pneumophila, salmonella typhimurium, and streptococcus mutans, which indicates that asad may also be an essential reaction in the metabolism of e.coli  <cit> . another active reaction is aspk, which is the commitment step in the pathway to the synthesis of lysine, methionine, threonine and isoleucine.

in smm, the reaction accoac is most active. it is a rate-determining step in the fatty acid synthetic pathway and may play a pivotal role in regulating fatty acid oxidation  <cit> . the second most active reaction mcoata transfers malonyl coa to acyl-carrier proteins . the product malonyl acp provides malonyl groups for biosynthesis of fatty acid and polyketide. on the other hand, malonyl coa, the substrate of mcoata, is a highly-regulated molecule in fatty acid synthesis as it inhibits the rate-limiting step in beta-oxidation of fatty acids  <cit> . flux change in mcoata affects the consistency of malonyl coa and guarantees the biosynthesis of fatty acid.

in stc, all the top reactions relate to the formation of the transcription elongation complex, an extremely complicated and highly regulated molecular machine that can sense signals coming from numerous regulatory protein factors, as well as those encoded in the dna sequence. they are the basis of transcription elongation, because transcription can run smoothly and continuously only depending on their precise work.

in stl, the reactions if2_recharg, rib_30_ini_form and rib_70_diss are used by all expas. if2_recharg recharges the initiation factor  <dig>  with gtp and rib_30_ini_form produces 30s translation initiation complex which consists of 30s subunit, if <dig>  if2-gtp and if <dig>  in bacteria, the correct mrna starting site and the reading frame are selected when, with the help of if <dig>  if <dig> and if <dig>  the initiation codon is decoded in the peptidyl site of the 30s ribosomal subunit by the anticodon fmet-trnafmet. furthermore, rib_30_ini_form is also proved to be the intermediate step in the formation of 70s initiation complex  which regulates translation initiation, the rate-limiting step in protein synthesis  <cit> . the other reaction rib_70_diss dissociates 70s ribosomes to 30s ribosomal subunit/if1/if <dig> complex  and 50s ribosomal subunit . this is an essential step before a ribosome can participate in a new round of translation since the initiation complex for protein synthesis involves a 30s subunit. the dissociation of 70s ribosomes contributes to the efficiency and sustainability of protein synthesis  <cit> .

reportedly, rprs help to find important reactions in mn  <cit> . our results further indicate that rpr can also be extended to trn and ttn to evaluate the relative importance of a given reaction.

correlated reaction set
a correlated reaction set  comprises reactions that always participate in the same expa set in a given network  <cit> ; namely if one reaction functions, the others in the same coset function simultaneously.

a coset can be transformed to a graph by treating each reaction as a node and adding an edge between two reactions that involve a common substance. in a certain coset, some member reactions are topologically connected while others are not. the correlationship of the second type of reactions often indicates a transcriptional coregulation by the corresponding genes  <cit>  while that of the first type has relatively trivial biological meaning. therefore, a coset is defined as a trivial set if all its member reactions are connected in topology. a trivial coset provides less novel information, and thus it is unworthy of deep study. in this paper, the adjacent ratio is used to represent the percentage of trivial cosets.

cosets were calculated for each biological network/sub-network about which several features, including the adjacent ratio, were stretched and shown in table  <dig>  the adjacent ratios of trn, stc and stl are much higher than those of sacl and smm, which indicates that almost all the cosets obtained in the former three networks are due to the linear structure. for the metabolic netowrk, more cosets consist of reactions which are not adjacent in topology. the results suggest that coset analysis may be more useful in study of mns.

adjacent ratio is defined as the percentage of such cosets in which all the reactions are topologically connected, that is, if all the reactions in a coset form a graph, the graph only contains one connected component.

crosstalk analysis
crosstalk analysis was first raised to illustrate the relationship between multiple inputs or outputs of a signaling pathway  <cit> . the whole expa set was compared pairwise to build the simplest form of crosstalk  <cit> . a pair of expas may have identical, overlapped or disjoint inputs . there are  <dig> categories of crosstalk with their biological meanings described in  <cit> . here, crosstalk analysis is applied to other biological processes to detect the relationships between fundamental functional states. various forms of crosstalk in the five networks/sub-networks above were characterized. as several exchange reactions participate in most expas of sacl, mn, stc and stl, almost all of the expa pairs have overlapped inputs or outputs. a close look at the highly participating exchange reactions reveals that most of them relate to small molecules such as h2o, atp and nadp commonly seen in various biochemical reactions. in order to further elucidate the difference in crosstalk between expa pairs, all the exchange reactions in the four sub-networks were sorted in a descending order depending on rpr and the top 20% expa pairs were neglected in the subsequent crosstalk analysis.

as shown in figure  <dig>  more than 90% of the expa pairs have disjoint inputs and disjoint outputs in trn, stc and stl in contrast to sacl and smm. a higher disjoint input/disjoint output rate implies that each expa has more specific functions and cannot be replaced easily by others. this indicates that the biological processes in e.coli ttn and trn are more deterministic than those in mn. reportedly, a large number of genes are regulated by only a few independent regulatory rules in e.coli trn  <cit> , and the majority of the associated functions in e.coli ttn have only one coding gene in the genome  <cit> . these facts indicate that the specificity of trn and ttn is much higher than mn. in order to function normally, cells have to respond accurately to the environmental signals with the help of precise transcriptional regulations and subsequently produce necessary gene products through accurate transcription and translation systems.

except stc, the other networks/sub-networks all have expa pairs with identical inputs and identical outputs. these expas are redundant pathways which fulfill completely identical function through systemically independent routes. expa redundancy was demonstrated in genome-scale mns  <cit> , as well as a prototypic signaling network  <cit>  and the jak-stat signaling network  <cit> . the redundant expas in e.coli trn can be attributed to the fact that the transcription of some genes can be stimulated by different transcriptional factors. for example, two redundant expas shown in figure  <dig> stimulate the expression of gene b <dig> in the same environment, but they employ the regulatory rules of 'crp_norib and fnr and not' and 'crp_norib and arca and not', respectively. from figure  <dig>  the percentage of expa pairs with overlapped inputs and overlapped outputs in the biological processes of mn is much higher than those in ttn and trn. these results indicate that e.coli mn is more flexible than ttn and trn.

discussion
expa analysis were applied to two new models, the e.coli trn and ttn. a horizontal comparison was performed for the five networks/sub-networks: trn, sacl, smm, stc, stl from five aspects:  total number of expas and the p/r ratios;  expa length distribution and l/r ratios;  reaction participation rates;  correlated reaction sets and adjacent ratios;  inter-connectivity of expas.

reactions in ttn represent actual biochemical reactions like those in mn, and thus, expas in ttn characterize the steady-states of the corresponding biological systems. in contrast, columns in trn represent the transcriptional regulatory rules and coefficents only reflect the qualitative information describing the presence or absence of the corresponding components rather than the quantitative information describing reaction stoichiometries as in ttn and mn. therefore, an expa in trn characterizes a specific transcriptional regulatory state, namely which transcriptional regulatory rules are activated and which genes are expressed in a specific environmental state.

expa analysis emphasizes the functional and systemic properties of biologcial process as expas are systemically independent functional units. the total number of expas and the p/r ratios characterize the flexibility of the networks/sub-networks. expa length corresponds to the reaction steps needed to form a steady state, therefore showing a close relation to network complexity. crosstalk enables the analysis of pathway redundancy and network determinacy. comparisons from these aspects indicate that mn is more flexible but less deterministic than trn and ttn. environmental cues affect transcriptional regulation, which controls the following transcription and translation processes. then the resulting gene products  enter the metabolic system to catalyze the corresponding reactions. it is necessary for a cell to respond accurately to the environment and produce the required enzymes. mn is more robust to environmental changes, which reflects the struggle of a cell to achieve an alternative steady-state to provide substance support for trn and ttn and maintain life.

the distributions of reaction participation in the five networks/sub-networks are similar except that there are more reactions participating in more than 10% expas in sacl and smm. only a small percent of the reactions participate in a large number of expas, which indicates the phenotypic potentials of trn, ttn and mn are affected greatly by a small number of important reactions. evaluations on the representatives show that reactions with high participation rates often play an important role in certain biological processes. these reactions are the relatively weak part of the networks because a large number of expas will be destroyed when these reactions become invalid, which may cause the loss of various functions. these reactions may be used as drug targets and further direct the design of new drugs.

cosets were identified via the calculation of reaction participation. besides the expected topological connections, the topologically unconnected reactions in a coset may indicate the information of transcriptional coregulation in mn. however, most cosets of trn and ttn are trivial, and thus have few chances to be a clue giving novel information like in mn.

last but not least, an improved approach was introduced to calculate the expas on trn models. compared to the existing method, the biggest advantage of ours is the high efficiency in calculating all the extreme pathways of a trn, especially for the one which may work under huge amount of environmental conditions. for example, the e.coli trn model which we studied in the paper has  <dig> components whose availability  constitute the environmental condition, including environmental stimuli, transcription factors or proteins. it is impossible to enumerate all the possible conditions due to "combination explosion" without mentioning the calculation of the expas under each condition. however, using the approach we proposed, it took only about  <dig> seconds to computing the whole expa set on a pc with four  <dig> -ghz intel xeon processors and 16gb ram . we believe that this approach could be helpful for readers who are also interested in the expas of trns.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents the first horizontal comparison among the e.coli trn, mn and ttn through expa analysis. the results show that expa also has biological meanings in trn and ttn. different properties of expas reflect the biological nature of each biological process. along with the the increase of reconstructed models on trns and ttns as well as the development of new methods, expa analysis may reveal more biological properties and get larger space of application in the medical and biochemical fields.
