BACKGROUND
mycoplasmas are wall-less, gram-positive bacteria and are pathogenic to humans, animals, and plants  <cit> . mycoplasma pneumoniae  is a human pathogen and causes acute and chronic diseases at multiple sites. respiratory diseases dominate and account for approximately 30% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia. mpn may also be a direct cause or significant cofactor in many extrapulmonary diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, and central nerve system manifestations such as encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute transverse myelitis, stroke, chronic fatigue, and polyradiculopathy  <cit> . due to the lack of cell wall, mpn is resistant to antibiotics targeting cell wall synthesis such as penicillin, and macrolides are the treatment of choice.

increased incidences/epidemics of mpn infections have been reported in scandinavian countries, france, scotland, and israel from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . in most cases, the infected individuals did not need medical attention. however, approximately 10% of the patients developed pneumonia and antibiotic treatment was needed. in severe cases, hospitalization was required and there were lethal cases when patients were infected by macrolide-resistant mpn strains  <cit> . during the last  <dig> years macrolide-resistant mpn strains have been frequently reported in asian countries and have been spreading to europe and the united states. in japan and china, approximately 90% of the isolates are resistant to erythromycin or azithromycin, especially among pediatric patients  <cit> . this limits treatment options for patients with severe mycoplasma pneumonia caused by macrolide resistant mpn strains. therefore, new antibiotics are needed.

nucleotides are not only the building blocks of dna and rna, but also regulatory factors in diverse cellular metabolic pathways, and therefore, inhibition of enzymes in this pathway will cause nucleotide pool imbalance, which will inhibit dna and rna synthesis and lead to cell death. when transported into and metabolized by cells, nucleoside analogs can interfere with metabolism of natural nucleotides and/or dna and rna synthesis. an example of this type of antibiotic is sulphonamides such as sulfamethoxazole that target dihydropteroate synthetase in the folic acid biosynthesis pathway, and inhibition of folic acid biosynthesis leads to impaired purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis  <cit> . another example is thymidylate synthase  inhibitors such as ralitrexed and 5-fluorouracil used as anticancer drugs  <cit> . today more than 50% of the united states food and drug administration -approved anticancer and antiviral drugs are nucleoside and nucleobase analogs. the most successful reports since the 1970s, using nucleoside analogs as drugs, were for the treatment of herpes viral infections by acyclic guanosine analogs such as acyclovir, and hiv infection by nucleoside analogs such as zidovudine or lamivudine in combination with protease inhibitors i.e., highly active antiretroviral therapy  <cit> .

compared to other antibacterial compounds, most nucleoside and nucleobase analogs used in anticancer and antiviral therapy have narrow therapeutic index and adverse side effects, with the exception of acyclic guanosine analogs used in the treatment of herpes viral infection. these adverse effects limit their use in the treatment of bacterial infections. in recent years efforts have been made to develop nucleoside analog based antibiotics, taking the advantage of structural differences in target enzymes between bacteria and their host to design and select specific inhibitors that will selectively kill the bacteria and spare the host  <cit> . for example, selective thymidylate kinase inhibitors have been developed and showed potent inhibitory effect in vivo against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus <cit> . toxicity or side effect of these thymidylate kinase inhibitors to humans remains to be seen.

mycoplasmas, in general, depend on exogenous supply of precursors for their nucleotide biosynthesis because they lack the de novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases. nucleosides and deoxynucleosides are efficiently taken up and phosphorylated to their respective nucleotides by deoxynucleoside kinases such as thymidine kinase  and deoxyadenosine kinase. nucleobases are salvaged through hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase , adenine phosphoribosyltransferase  and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase  systems  <cit> . of a total of  <dig> enzymes in nucleotide biosynthesis identified in the mpn genome,  <dig> are essential. enzymes mentioned above, tk, hprt, aprt and uprt are essential for mpn survival while thymidylate synthase , an enzyme catalyses the reductive synthesis of thymidylate from uridylate, is not since thya mutant mpn strain that lacks ts is viable  <cit> .

in this study,  <dig> fda-approved nucleoside and nucleobase analogs that are anticancer or antiviral drugs were screened for inhibitory effects on mpn growth. seven analogs showed potent inhibitory effects on mpn growth at clinically achievable plasma concentrations. among them, 6-thioguanine  inhibited mpn growth with a mic  value of  <dig>  μg ml- <dig>  to investigate the mechanism of action of these drugs, we studied the effects of these analogs on uptake and metabolism of natural nucleoside and nucleobases by using tritium labelled natural substrates. furthermore mpn hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase  was cloned and expressed, and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized using tritium labelled hypoxanthine and guanine as substrates, and 6-thiuoguanine and other purine analogs as inhibitors. the role of thymidine kinase in the inhibitory effect of trifluorothymidine against mpn growth was also investigated.

RESULTS
inhibition of mpn growth by nucleoside and nucleobase analogs
some nucleoside analogs have been reported to inhibit mycoplasma growth  <cit> . recently a nucleoside and nucleobase analog library consisting of fda-approved prodrugs used in anticancer and antiviral therapy was used to screen human enzymes in nucleotide metabolism, and new interactions were found  <cit> , which promoted the use of these analogs in screening for inhibitory effects on mpn growth. a series dilution of each compound in mycoplasma growth medium was added to mpn cultures in 96-well plates. the plates were sealed and incubated at 37°c. mpn growth was monitored by using growth index value e.g. the ratio of absorbance at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm of the culture medium  <cit> . thirty nucleoside and nucleobase analogs and a nucleoside transporter inhibitor were included, and two mpn strains, wild type and a thya mutant , were used. sixteen of these compounds inhibited mpn growth to varying levels, and seven showed strong inhibition . the anticancer drug 6-tg and the antiviral and anticancer drug trifluorothymidine  strongly inhibited mpn growth, with mic values of  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> and  <dig>  μg ml- <dig>  respectively. gemcitabine , an anticancer agent, was also strong inhibitor of mpn growth with mic of approximately  <dig>  μg ml- <dig>  dipyridamole, a nucleoside transporter inhibitor, also strongly inhibited mpn growth with mic of  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> . all analogs had mic values at clinically achievable plasma concentrations. the cultures were kept for additional  <dig> weeks in the incubator and there was no indication of growth.

*mic = minimal concentrations of the compound that produced 90% inhibition.

for most compounds, the inhibitory effects were similar between the wild type and the thya mutant mpn strains, however differences between the two mpn strains were also observed. for example, gancyclovir inhibited wild type mpn but not the thya mutant, whereas valacyclovir did not inhibit mpn growth. ribavirin and pentoxifylline inhibited wild type mpn but not the thya mutant. among the 5-halogenated pyrimidine analogs, most of them inhibited both the wild type and the thya mutant strain, but 5-iododeoxyuridine only inhibited the wild type mpn growth .

uptake and metabolism of natural nucleosides and nucleobases in the presence of analogs
to investigate the mechanism of inhibition by these analogs, we incubated mpn wild type cells with radiolabelled natural substrates in the presence and absence of those analogs that strongly inhibited mpn growth. total uptake and metabolism of the radiolabelled substrates were analysed to access whether the observed growth inhibition is at the level of nucleoside transporter or metabolism or both . in general the uptake of nucleobases e.g. -ade , -gua , -ura , and -hx  was low  as compared with that of -dt  . dipyridamole strongly inhibited the uptake and incorporation of -hx and -gua into dna and rna but had no effect on uptake and metabolism of all other nucleobases and -dt, suggesting that dipyridamole is a specific inhibitor of purine transport. similar to dipyridamole, 6-tg also strongly inhibited the uptake and incorporation of -hx and -gua into dna and rna but had no effect on any other nucleobases and dt. pyrimidine nucleoside analogs, tft, 5fdu  and dfdc, inhibited the uptake and incorporation of all nucleobases. however, -dt uptake was stimulated  by tft and 5fdu but inhibited by dfdc, and the percentage of radioactivity found in dna was similar to that of control in all cases . these results indicate that there are distinct transporters for purines and pyrimidines and that metabolic rate determines the extent of uptake.

*total uptake: percentage of radioactivity recovered in the cells divided by total radioactivity added to the growth medium.

incorporation: percentage of radioactivity in the acid insoluble fraction divided by total radioactivity recovered in the cells.

up-regulation of mpn tk activity by tft
to understand why tft and 5fdu stimulated -dt uptake, mpn wild type cells were incubated with various concentrations of tft in the presence of -dt. total proteins were extracted from these cultures and used to determine the tk and ts activity. total uptake of -dt increased in a concentration dependent manner while the percentage of -dt found in dna was similar. tk activity increased also as the concentration of tft increases and with  <dig> μm tft the tk activity was ~  <dig> times of the activity found in the controls. ts activity, however, was unchanged . these results demonstrated that tft induced up-regulation of tk activity but had no effect on ts activity, and suggested that the high level of dt uptake in the presence of tft and 5fdu is due to increased tk activity.

expression, purification, and characterization of hprt
the purine analog 6-tg strongly inhibited mpn growth, which promoted further investigation of potential targets of this compound. hprt is the first enzyme in the salvage pathway of purine bases for nucleotide biosynthesis, and is the enzyme responsible for metabolizing 6-tg in human patients treated with this drug  <cit> . mpn hprt  consists of  <dig> amino acids and shares 29% sequence identity to human hprt. mpn hprt cdna was cloned and expressed in e. coli. recombinant mpn hprt was expressed as an n-terminal fusion protein with a  <dig> × histidine tag and a tobacco etch virus  cleavage site at the n-terminus, and was purified to >98% purity by metal affinity chromatography, as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  analysis .

the purified mpn hprt used both hypoxanthine  and guanine  as substrates but not adenine or uracil. with hx as substrate the reaction was linear with time for up to  <dig> min and the substrate saturation curve was hyperbolic, which indicated that the enzyme followed michaelis–menten kinetics with a km value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and vmax value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol min- <dig> mg- <dig> . however, with gua as a substrate, the reverse reaction rate was very high and the reaction reached equilibrium in less than  <dig> min under the same conditions used for hx. therefore, the kinetic study with gua was conducted differently as described in the experimental procedures. substrate saturation for gua exhibited a biphasic curve and therefore, data was fitted using the hill equation. the vmax value was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol min- <dig> mg- <dig> and s <dig>  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm with a hill coefficient of  <dig>  , indicating positive cooperativity with gua binding.

inhibition of mpn and human hprt with 6-tg and other purine analogs
to study the mechanism of inhibition by 6-tg on mpn growth, we determined the inhibitory effect of 6-tg, 6-mercaptopurine , and two other purine analogs that did not inhibit mpn growth on mpn hprt, and compared the results with human hprt. the 6-tg strongly inhibited mpn hprt with either hx or gua as a substrate, and the half maximal inhibitory concentration  values were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . the 6-tg also inhibited human hprt, but with a much higher ic <dig> value . the 6-mp inhibited mpn hprt with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> μm . with human hprt, 6-mp had similar ic <dig> values to those of 6-tg. theophylline and caffeine were poor inhibitors of both mpn and human hprt .

*assays were performed with  <dig> μm tritium labelled hypoxanthine or guanine as substrates and various concentrations of the inhibitors. data were mean ± standard deviation  from at least three independent determinations. p <  <dig>  is considered as significant.

nd = not determined.

trifluorothymidine  as substrate for human thymidine kinase   <dig>  tk <dig>  and ureaplasma tk
tft is a known substrate of human tk <dig>  and has been used as an antiviral and anticancer drug. we found that tft strongly inhibited mpn growth, suggesting that mpn tk may have a role in growth inhibition caused by tft. the mechanism of inhibition by tft and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine  was proposed to be linked to inhibition of ts  <cit> . however, we observed that tft and 5fdu inhibited both the wild type and the thya mutant strains to similar extents, suggesting that the mechanism of inhibition is unlikely to be solely by inhibition of ts activity. therefore, we sought to characterize tft phosphorylation by mycoplasma tk and compared this with the human enzymes. kinetic studies with tft were performed with purified recombinant human tk <dig> , tk <dig> , and ureaplasma tk. because ureaplasma tk and mpn tk share 46% sequence identity and they also share 36% respective 32% sequence identity to human tk <dig>  <cit> , and mpn tk is not available. the phosphorylation of tft by human tk <dig>  tk <dig>  and ureaplasma tk followed michaelis-menten kinetics and the km values for the three enzymes were in the same range, while the kcat values varied between the three enzymes . ureaplasma tk had the highest kcat value and human tk <dig> had the lowest kcat value . however, the overall efficiency was highest with human tk <dig> and lowest with human tk <dig> .

*assays were performed using phosphoryl transfer assay with -labelled atp  and variable concentrations of tft . the reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography and were quantified. thymidine  was used as a control. data are from three independent measurements and are expressed as mean ± sd.

inhibition of human tk <dig>  tk <dig>  and ureaplasma and mpn tk by tft and 5fdu
both tft and 5fdu are substrates of mycoplasma and human tks, as described above and earlier studies  <cit> . however, their inhibitory effects on these enzymes are not known, and inhibition of tk activity by these two analogs may account for the observed mpn growth inhibition. therefore, we determined the ic <dig> values for tft and 5fdu with dt as a substrate and found significant differences in ic <dig> values between tft and 5fdu for all enzymes. tft inhibited dt phosphorylation in mpn protein extracts with an ic <dig> value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm, which was similar to that of recombinant ureaplasma tk. with recombinant human tk <dig> and tk <dig>  the ic <dig> values were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig> ±  <dig>  μm, respectively. the inhibition by 5fdu was much weaker for all recombinant enzymes and mpn extracts . thus, tft was a significantly better inhibitor than 5fdu.

*assays were performed with  <dig> μm tritium labelled thymidine as substrate in the presence of various concentrations of the inhibitors. data were mean ± sd from at least three independent determinations. p value <  <dig>  is considered as significant.

discussion
mycoplasmas differ from their hosts in the biosynthesis of precursors for dna and rna because they cannot synthesize purine and pyrimidine bases de novo. therefore, they rely totally on the salvage pathway for nucleotide biosynthesis . purine bases such as hx, gua, and ade are recycled by hprt and adenine phosphoribosyl transferase, whereas the pyrimidine base, uracil is salvaged by uracil phosphoribosyl transferase  <cit> . the salvage of deoxynucleosides is catalyzed by deoxynucleoside kinases, including tk and deoxyadenosine/deoxyguanosine kinase  <cit> . the deoxynucleoside monophosphates are further phosphorylated to their corresponding triphosphates and are used as precursors for dna synthesis. the ribonucleoside monophosphates are further phosphorylated to their triphosphate forms, and are then incorporated into rna, or the diphosphate forms can be reduced by ribonucleotide reductase to produce precursors for dna synthesis . of  <dig> genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis,  <dig> are essential  <cit> . therefore, it has been suggested that this pathway may be a therapeutic target for future development of antibiotics  <cit> .

our screening of  <dig> fda-approved anticancer and antiviral nucleoside analogs revealed seven potent inhibitors of mpn growth with mic values at clinically achievable plasma concentrations. nucleoside and nucleobase analogs used in anticancer and antiviral therapy are prodrugs. in order to exert their therapeutic potential they have to compete with natural substrates for uptake  and metabolism . once phosphorylated these analogs are trapped inside the cells and further metabolized to their active form by cellular enzymes, therefore, competition/inhibition of enzymes  in the initial phosphorylation step would also affect the uptake and metabolism of these compounds, and thus their cytotoxic effect . as shown in table  <dig>  dipyridamole and 6-tg inhibited hx and gua uptake and metabolism but not ade or ura, suggesting that hprt may be an immediate target. pyrimidine nucleoside analogs e.g. tft, 5fdu and dfdc affected the uptake and metabolism of all radiolabeled substrates, indicating that multiple enzymes/steps are involved and the extent of uptake of specific nucleoside or nucleobase is determined by activities of these metabolic enzymes .

the 6-tg inhibited mpn growth with mic value of  <dig>  μg ml- <dig>  which is equivalent to tetracycline . however, 6-mp, a 6-tg analog did not inhibit mpn growth. neither theophylline, 7- theophylline, allopurinol, nor caffeine inhibited mpn growth. 6-tg strongly inhibited uptake and incorporation of nucleotides derived from hx and gua into dna and rna, indicating that the observed inhibition by 6-tg was both at the level of transport and metabolism. it is noteworthy that the uptake/metabolism of hx and gua was inhibited by all the analogs used.

thiopurines, especially mercaptopurines, are the first line drugs for the treatment of acute leukemia since the 1950s. they are also used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> . the 6-tg and 6-mp exert their cytotoxicity through incorporation into dna as deoxy-6-thioguanosine. these thiopurines are metabolized to deoxy-6-thioguanosine triphosphate via the purine salvage pathway initiated by hprt . thiopurine methyl transferase is a key enzyme in converting mercaptopurine to its cytotoxic metabolites, which can either inhibit purine nucleotide biosynthesis or incorporate into dna or rna, causing dna damage and cell death  <cit> . mpn does not possess the essential enzymes, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and thiopurine methyl transferase, to convert mercaptopurine to the cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides, the respective methyl thiopurine nucleotides. this may explain why 6-mp did not inhibit mpn growth.

to further investigate the mechanism by which 6-tg inhibited mpn growth, mpn hprt was expressed, purified, and characterized. both hx and gua are good substrates for the enzyme and the vmax values for these substrates are in the same order of magnitude as the human enzyme  <cit> . in humans, the plasma concentrations of hx and gua are approximately  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm  <cit> , which is close to the km and s <dig>  values of mpn hprt with hx and gua. these results suggest that mpn hprt is capable of efficiently salvaging both hx and gua. in addition, mpn hprt showed positive cooperativity with gua, indicating that at higher gua concentration the enzyme utilizes gua better.

6-tg and 6-mp are structural analogs. the observed significant differences in their inhibitory effects with mpn and human hprt suggest that there are structural differences in binding of these two compounds to the respective hprts in their active sites. these differences could be used in future design of mycoplasma specific inhibitors. hprt has been suggested as a target for anti-parasite drug development and new compounds have been developed  <cit> .

halogenated pyrimidine analogs such as 5fdu inhibited mpn and ureaplasma growth, as reported in our earlier studies  <cit> . others have shown that tft and 5fdu inhibited cryptosporidium growth  <cit> , and gemcitabine inhibited staphylococcus aureus growth in vitro and in animal models  <cit> . in this study, several halogenated pyrimidine analogs inhibited mpn growth, and tft and dfdc were more potent than 5fdu. the mechanism of inhibition by dfdc is most likely due to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and incorporation into dna by dfdc metabolites . we did not observe significant differences in the inhibitory effects between the wild type and the thya mutant strains, suggesting that ts activity is not required for toxicity of these compounds to mpn.

mycoplasma tk is an essential enzyme while ts is not  <cit> . the expression of tk in mpn was correlated with mpn growth and dna synthesis, and upregulation of tk activity was observed in an mpn strain lacking ts activity  <cit> . the phosphorylated products of tft and 5fdu by tk irreversibly inhibit ts activity via covalent binding to the enzyme, and down regulation of ts activity leads to upregulation of tk activity, similar to what was observed with the thya mutant  <cit> . increased salvage of dt due to the induction of tk activity leads to higher level of dttp, an allosteric regulator of purine nucleotide reduction by ribonucleotide reductase. inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity by high level of dttp led to decreased uptake and incorporation of labelled nucleobases as shown in this study, which may result in imbalance in nucleotide pools. in addition, high tk activity facilitates the phosphorylation of tft and 5fdu and accumulation of tft-tp and 5fdutp that may affect the integrity of dna and lead eventually to cell death . the fact that both tft and 5fdu inhibited the growth of both wild type and the thya mutant strain to the same extent, and the tk activity is upregulated by tft and 5fdu, suggests that tk plays an important role in growth inhibition observed with these compounds.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have shown that several anticancer and antiviral nucleoside and nucleobase analogs are potent inhibitors of mpn growth and that the plausible mechanism of growth inhibition by these analogs are due to inhibition of enzymes in the nucleotide biosynthesis pathway and nucleoside transporter. we should keep in mind that the analogs used in this study are potent anticancer and antiviral drugs and most of them have diverse adverse side effect in humans and therefore, they may not be suitable for treatment of a mild mpn infection. however, the results obtained with these analogs may be used as leads in the design of mycoplasma specific inhibitors, substrates, or non-substrate inhibitors for the target enzymes in order to reduce the risk of host cell toxicity. more work regarding the mechanism of action of these drugs is needed. this study has provided the basis for future development of antibiotics against mycoplasma or other bacteria.
