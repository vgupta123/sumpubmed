BACKGROUND
bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that causes anthrax  <cit> . intentional use of anthrax spores as a weapon of bioterror in  <dig> has provoked a need for research to find effective countermeasures  <cit> . when anthrax spores enter the host via diverse infection routes, macrophages, major sentinels of the immune system, serve as a reservoir of anthrax spores for germination. macrophages then transport the bacteria to regional lymph nodes where the released bacilli multiply extensively  <cit> . once vegetative bacilli form, they secrete high levels of exotoxins and spread systemically via the bloodstream. the exotoxins are composed of three distinct proteins, protective antigen , edema factor, and lethal factor , which are secreted separately as nontoxic monomers  <cit> . the binding of lf or edema factor to pa oligomer results in the formation of active lethal toxin  or edema toxin, respectively, both of which cause massive edema, organ failure, and death of the host  <cit> .

once the pathogen invades the host, the innate immune response is the first line of defense. innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells elicit inflammatory responses to counteract microbial infections through pattern-recognition receptors  that recognize conserved microbial structures known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns   <cit> . the best-characterized family of prr is the tlrs, which are evolutionarily conserved from insects to humans  <cit> . it is well established that each tlr recognizes different sets of pamp in bacteria or viruses. among the pamp that have been identified, microbial dna shows potent immunomodulating effects on immune cells including macrophages  <cit> . this stimulatory effect is due to a high frequency of unmethylated cpg sequences as compared with mammalian dna  <cit> . unmethylated microbial cpg dna from bacteria, viruses, and fungi is recognized by tlr <dig>  which is expressed in the endosomal compartment  <cit> . the engagement of tlr <dig> subsequently recruits myd <dig>  which is a common adaptor molecule in tlr-mediated signaling except tlr <dig>  <cit> . the interaction of tlr <dig> with myd <dig> in turn activates il- <dig> receptor–associated kinase- <dig> and − <dig> and tnf-associated factor  <dig>  leading to the activation of mapks and nf-κb to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α and il- <dig>  <cit> .

macrophages have been crucially implicated in b. anthracis–mediated pathogenesis. once the host is infected, b. anthracis spores are engulfed by macrophages and induce production of tnf-α and il- <dig>  <cit> . some components of the vegetative form of b. anthracis have also been reported to be recognized by macrophages and stimulate innate immune responses  <cit> . it was previously reported that anthrolysin o, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin in b. anthracis, induces tnf-α production in bone marrow–derived macrophages  in a tlr4-dependent manner  <cit> . in addition, poly-γ-d-glutamic acid  capsules in b. anthracis elicit il-1β production in pma-differentiated thp- <dig> macrophages  <cit> . furthermore, b. anthracis peptidoglycan , which is a major component of bacterial cell walls, stimulates tnf-α production by human monocytes  <cit> . bacterial components such as pgn, lps, and pga sensitize lt-resistant macrophages to lethal toxin through production of tnf-α  <cit> . however, the role of other molecules produced by b. anthracis in innate immunity and pathogenesis remains unclear.

in this study, we investigated the effect of highly purified bag on tnf-α production. furthermore, we examined the role of bag on lt-mediated cytotoxicity of macrophages in vitro and in balb/c mice. our results might suggest the importance of bag in anthrax pathogenesis.

RESULTS
infection with b. anthracis spores enhances tlr <dig> mrna and tnf-α expression
to examine whether infection of macrophages with b. anthracis spores increases tlr <dig> mrna expression, we infected raw <dig>  cells with b. anthracis spores  for various time periods and then examined tlr <dig> mrna expression using real-time rt-pcr . tlr <dig> mrna expression significantly increased, peaked at 6 h and decreased thereafter at 8 h .figure  <dig> 
b. anthracis
spore infection enhances tlr <dig> and tnf-α expression in raw <dig>  cells.  cells were infected with b. anthracis spores  prepared from b. anthracis strain atcc  <dig> for the indicated times. at the end of the infection periods, total rna was prepared, and tlr <dig> expression was analyzed using real-time rt-pcr.  raw <dig>  cells were infected with increasing numbers of b. anthracis spores . tnf-α protein  was analyzed by elisa 8 h after infection; tnf-α mrna  expression was analyzed by real-time rt-pcr 2 h after infection.  cells were pretreated with odn <dig> for 1 h and then infected with b. anthracis spores  for a further 5 h. at the end of the incubation period, culture supernatants were collected and subjected to elisa. *p < <dig>  as compared with the untreated control group .



the proinflammatory cytokine tnf-α increases upon tlr <dig> activation  <cit>  and plays an important role in b. anthracis lt-induced cytotoxicity of macrophages  <cit> . therefore, we next investigated whether infection with b. anthracis spores induced the expression of tnf-α. b. anthracis spores significantly increased the level of both tnf-α protein and mrna at a moi-dependent manner . because tlr <dig> mrna expression was significantly enhanced by b. anthracis spore infection, we examined whether tlr <dig> is involved in b. anthracis spore–induced tnf-α production. b. anthracis spore-induced tnf-α production was attenuated by the addition of  <dig> or 10 μm odn <dig>  a tlr <dig> inhibitor, in a dose-dependent manner to  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively, as compared with that of samples infected with b. anthracis spores only . these results suggest that b. anthracis spores can induce tnf-α production in macrophages and that tlr <dig> is involved in tnf-α production following b. anthracis spore infection.

bag induces tnf-α protein and mrna expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner
because b. anthracis spores significantly enhanced tlr <dig> and tnf-α expression in macrophages, we next examined whether bag, which is known to be a tlr <dig> agonist  <cit> , induced tnf-α expression at the protein and mrna levels using elisa and real-time rt-pcr, respectively. bag significantly augmented the level of both tnf-α protein and mrna at a dose-dependent fashion . in time-course experiments, bag-induced tnf-α mrna expression increased, peaked at 6 h and declined thereafter up to 24 h. in addition, the level of tnf-α protein also increased in a time-dependent manner . these results showed that bag induced tnf-α expression at both the mrna and protein levels.figure  <dig> 
bag augments tnf-α protein and mrna expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. raw <dig>  cells were stimulated  with various doses of bag  for 24 h  or 3 h , or  with 10 μg/ml bag for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 24 h. at the end of the stimulation, total rna was extracted or culture supernatants were collected. real-time rt-pcr and elisa were conducted to analyze bag-induced tnf-α mrna and protein levels, respectively. values are the mean ± sd of three replicates per group. *p < <dig>  as compared with the untreated control group.



bag stimulates tnf-α production in a tlr9-dependent manner
bacterial genomic dna containing unmethylated cpg motifs and synthetic cpg odn both have potent immunostimulating effects including inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines in various cell types such as b cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells through tlr <dig>  <cit> . additionally, endosomal acidification and maturation are required for full activation of tlr <dig> signaling pathways  <cit> . therefore, we examined whether bag-induced tnf-α production is mediated through tlr <dig>  both the tlr <dig> inhibitor odn <dig> and the endosomal acidification inhibitor cq significantly attenuated bag-induced tnf-α production in a dose-dependent manner .figure  <dig> 
the effect of bag on tnf-α production is tlr <dig> dependent.  raw <dig>  cells were pretreated with tlr <dig> inhibitors:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> nm odn <dig> or  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  or 10 μm cq for 1 h, followed by stimulation with 10 μg/ml bag for an additional 24 h.  raw <dig>  cells were transfected with tlr <dig> sirna or control sirna for 48 h. then, the cells were stimulated with 1 μm cpg odn <dig> as a positive control or 10 μg bag for an additional 24 h.  bmdm from tlr <dig> wt and ko mice were stimulated with  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  or 10 μg/ml bag for 24 h.  bmdm from tlr <dig> wt and ko mice were stimulated with 1 μm cpg odn <dig> or  <dig>  μg/ml pam3csk <dig> for 24 h.  bmdm from tlr <dig> wt and ko mice were infected with increasing numbers of b. anthracis spores  for 8 h. at the end of the incubation period, culture supernatants were collected and subjected to elisa. *p < <dig>  and **p < <dig>  as compared with the relevant control group.



to verify that tlr <dig> is responsible for bag-induced tnf-α production, we carried out tlr <dig> sirna experiments. tlr <dig> sirna significantly reduced the bag- and cpg-odn–induced tnf-α production to  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively, as compared with results from bag or cpg-odn treatment in the presence of the control sirna . additionally, to confirm the involvement of tlr <dig> on bag-induced tnf-α production, we used bmdm from tlr <dig> wt and ko mice. bag-induced tnf-α production was completely abolished in tlr <dig> ko bmdm as cpg odn <dig> but not a tlr <dig> ligand, pam3csk <dig> . to further verify the role of tlr <dig> on b. anthracis spores-induced tnf-α production, we infected bmdm from tlr <dig> wt and ko mice with b. anthracis spores. spores-induced tnf-α production from tlr <dig> wt bmdm was significantly attenuated in tlr <dig> ko bmdm . the amount of tnf-α produced by spore infection in bmdm was comparable to those using j774a. <dig> cells . these results indicate that bag induces tnf-α production through tlr9-dependent signaling pathways.

mapk pathways are essential for bag-induced tnf-α production
because mapk pathways play a pivotal role in tnf-α expression  <cit> , we examined whether bag could induce the phosphorylation of mapk in raw <dig>  cells using western blotting. when the cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml bag for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 60 min, phosphorylation of mapk increased beginning at 15 min  or 30 min  after bag treatment and declined thereafter . to further confirm the involvement of mapk subtypes on bag-induced tnf-α production, cells were pretreated with inhibitors of erk , p <dig> , or jnk kinases . tnf-α production was attenuated by all three mapk inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner . these results indicate that mapk pathways are critical for tnf-α production induced by bag treatment in raw <dig>  cells.figure  <dig> 
mapk pathways are important for bag-induced tnf-α production.  raw <dig>  cells were treated with 10 μg/ml bag for the indicated time periods. at the end of the stimulation periods, the cells were lysed, and cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis to determine the intracellular levels of erk, p <dig>  and jnk, and their phosphorylated forms.  raw <dig>  cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of mapk inhibitors including erk , p <dig> , or jnk  for 1 h, followed by stimulation with 10 μg/ml bag for an additional 24 h. values are the mean ± sd of triplicate samples. *p < <dig>  as compared with the bag-treated group.



bag and b. anthracis spores induce nf-κb activation
the transcription factor nf-κb is important for tnf-α gene expression  <cit> . moreover, nf-κb is regulated by mapk during tnf-α expression  <cit> . thus, we investigated whether bag could lead to nf-κb activation using an nf-κb–driven luciferase reporter system and confocal microscopic analysis of nf-κb p <dig> translocation to the nucleus. nf-κb luciferase activity was significantly increased by bag stimulation in a dose-dependent manner . next, we examined whether bag or b. anthracis spores could also induce nf-κb activation. stimulation of cells with bag or spore infection remarkably increased nf-κb activation, and this was confirmed by nf-κb p <dig> translocation into the nucleus as seen with anti-p <dig> immunostaining . these results showed that bag or spore infection induced activation of nf-κb, which is crucially involved in tnf-α gene expression.figure  <dig> 
bag and
b. anthracis
spores induce nf-κb activation.  raw <dig>  cells were cotransfected for 24 h with a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid regulated by the nf-κb transcription factor together with prl-tk renilla luciferase plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency. then, the cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of bag for a further 8 h. at the end of the stimulation period, the cells were lysed, and the dual luciferase activities were measured. firefly luciferase activity was normalized to renilla luciferase activity. values are the mean ± sd of triplicate assays. *p < <dig>  as compared with the untreated control group.  raw <dig>  cells were not stimulated or were stimulated with 1 μg/ml bag or lps or with b. anthracis spores  for 1 h and then stained with anti-p <dig> followed by alexa-488–conjugated secondary antibody and dapi. confocal images were obtained.



treatment with bag or tnf-α enhances the cytotoxic activity of lt on the macrophage cell line j774a.1
lt is a key factor in anthrax pathogenesis, and constituents of b. anthracis including anthrolysin o and pga augment the activity of lt  <cit> . therefore, we next determined the effect of bag on the cytotoxic activity of lt on j774a. <dig> cells. treatment of cells with 10 μg/ml bag alone did not affect the cell viability, whereas  <dig> or 10 μg/ml bag with lt significantly augmented the frequency of cell death . when cells were treated with 10 μg/ml bag with lt, cell viability was significantly decreased to  <dig> %  as compared with samples treated with lt only.figure  <dig> 
treatment with bag and pretreatment with tnf-α enhance lt-mediated cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner.  j774a. <dig> cells were treated with medium alone, lt , or lt +  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  or 10 μg/ml bag.  j774a. <dig> cells were pre-treated with  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> , or 1 μg/ml tnf-α for 24 h, and then lt  was added. after the 4-h incubation with lt, cell viability was determined using the mtt assay. the y axis represents the percent survival relative to control values and is given as the mean ± sd derived from three separate experiments. *p < <dig>  as compared with the untreated control group.



because tnf-α enhances lt-mediated cell death  <cit>  and because, in the current study, bag induced substantial tnf-α secretion by macrophages, we examined whether pretreatment with tnf-α affected the cytotoxic activity of lt on j774a. <dig> cells. pretreatment with  <dig> ,  <dig>  or 1 μg/ml tnf-α significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of lt . pretreatment with tnf-α  significantly decreased cell viability to  <dig> %  as compared with lt treatment alone. in addition, we further examined whether pretreatment of low concentrations of tnf-α can enhance the cytotoxicity of lt. pretreatment with  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  ng/ml tnf-α significantly enhanced the cytotoxic activity of lt, although cytotoxicity was lower than that of high concentrations of tnf-α treatment . because bag induced maximal tnf-α production in macrophages at 24 h post-stimulation, we examined whether pretreatment of bag can also augment the cytotoxicity of lt. pretreatment of bag enhanced the cytotoxic activity of lt at concentrations of 1 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml . these results suggest that bag plays an important role in lt-induced macrophage death and that tnf-α secretion induced by bag may be involved in this cell death.

genomic dna is detected during anthrax infection and enhances lt-mediated lethality in mice
to examine the in vivo relevance of bag pathogenesis, 6-week-old balb/c female mice were injected with 5 × ld <dig> of b. anthracis h <dig> or pbs as a control through the tail vein. after 24 h, circulating bag from sera was isolated, and pcr was performed using b. anthracis 16s rrna gene-specific primers. in sera from  <dig> of  <dig> mice injected with b. anthracis spores, amplification of 16s rrna gene-specific fragments was observed, whereas b. anthracis 16s rrna was not detected in the pbs-challenged group. the amount of bag in sera ranged from  <dig>  μg/ml to  <dig>  μg/ml, with an average of  <dig>  μg/ml .figure  <dig> 
bag was detected during spore infection and enhanced lt-mediated lethality in mice.  six-week-old balb/c female mice were infected with 5× ld <dig> of b. anthracis h <dig> spores  or injected with pbs  into the tail vein. after 24 h, sera were isolated and filtered to remove bacilli. genomic dna was quantified by analyzing the signal intensity of b. anthracis 16s rrna gene-specific pcr products. the relative amount was calculated based on a standard curve equation. each triangle or circle represents a single experiment, and the horizontal bar indicates the mean. *p < <dig>  as compared with the pbs-injected group.  kaplan-meier survival curves for balb/c female mice injected with bag and/or lt into the tail vein. infliximab  was given by intraperitoneal route before injection with lt + bag. the percent survival was determined at 14 days after injection. mice injected with bag  with lt  showed decreased survival  when compared with lt  group , however, the lowered survival was recovered by injecting tnf-α inhibiting infliximab . pbs , bag , and infliximab  were injected as controls. *p < <dig>  as compared with the lt-bag group.



next, to determine the influence of bag on lt-induced lethality in vivo, 6-week-old mice were given a tail vein injection of 20 μg bag alone or with lt. mice were then monitored for 14 days. all mice  that received pbs or 20 μg bag alone survived, but only 50%  of the mice that received lt survived . survival rates of mice that received bag with lt decreased significantly to 8%  as compared with those given lt alone . to verify whether the increase of mice lethality was due to the bag-induced tnf-α, 1 mg of infliximab  was administered into each mouse before injecting bag with lt. consequently, the decreased survival due to the injection of bag with lt was significantly recovered up to 75%  by injection of infliximab  compared to bag + lt group. all mice  that received infliximab alone were alive. these results suggest that bag produced in blood of infected mice during anthrax progress can enhance the lt-induced death by increasing tnf-α production.

discussion
innate immune responses induced by b. anthracis spore infection are mediated by various types of prr including tlrs and nod-like receptors  <cit> . in the present study, we showed that infection by fully virulent b. anthracis spores induced not only transcriptional upregulation of tlr <dig> but also production of tnf-α in murine macrophage raw <dig>  cells. we showed that tlr <dig> is involved in spore-induced tnf-α production by pretreatment of raw <dig>  cells with both the endosomal acidification inhibitor cq and the tlr <dig> inhibitor odn <dig>  purified bag, a putative tlr <dig> ligand containing cpg motifs, led to production of tnf-α in a dose-dependent manner in both raw <dig>  cells and bmdm, and this production was mediated by mapk and nf-кb signaling pathways via tlr <dig>  lt-mediated macrophage cytotoxicity was enhanced by treatment with bag and exogenous tnf-α. this effect was confirmed in vivo using mice. compared with the intravenous administration of bag that had no lethal effect, co-injection of bag with lt increased lt-mediated lethality in mice and this effect was significantly reversed by administration of infliximab, an anti-tnf-α monoclonal antibody. in addition, detection of bag in the sera of anthrax spore–infected mice is consistent with a possible role for bag-induced tnf-α in the lethality in mice. based on these observations, we postulated that bag and other virulence factors during anthrax infection are recognized by tlr <dig> and their corresponding receptors, which induce tnf-α production via mapk and nf-кb signaling pathways. tnf-α induced by bag and other virulence factors enhances lt-mediated cytotoxicity, which results in enhanced lethality in mice .figure  <dig> 
anthrax infection and bag exposure enhances lt-mediated cytotoxicity in macrophages via tnf-α production and eventually increases lethality in mice. bag during anthrax infection is recognized by tlr <dig>  which is inhibited by cq or odn <dig> and induces tnf-α production via mapk  and nf-κb pathways. secreted tnf-α by bag and other virulence factors of b. anthracis enhances lt-mediated macrophage death and eventually increases the lethality of mice.



we demonstrated that dna from b. anthracis elicited an inflammatory response by inducing production of the proinflammatory cytokine tnf-α in mouse macrophages. in line with our results, an immunostimulating effect of bacterial dna has been reported, although the stimulatory potential differs among different species  <cit> . genomic dna from periodontopathogenic bacteria such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis stimulates macrophages to produce tnf-α and il- <dig>  <cit> . dna from group b streptococcus, which causes neonatal sepsis and meningitis, also activates macrophages to produce tnf-α  <cit> . in addition, dna from gram-negative e. coli and gram-positive bacteria such as enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus triggers macrophages to release tnf-α  <cit> . in contrast, probiotic lactobacillus plantarum genomic dna does not elicit tnf-α production in the human macrophage cell line thp- <dig>  <cit> . bacterial genomic dna has been considered one of the principal contributors to sepsis  <cit> . tlr9-deficient mice are resistant to polymicrobial sepsis in an experimental peritonitis model  <cit> . intravenous administration of 300 μg genomic dna from e. coli to dba/ <dig> mice does not induce lethality, whereas 75% of mice die when given the same amount of e. coli dna plus 100 μg lps  <cit> . additionally, d-galactosamine–sensitized mice, which are an in vivo model for sepsis, die because of macrophage-derived tnf-α, which is induced by 300 μg e. coli dna or injection of 10 nmol odn <dig>  a synthetic tlr <dig> ligand  <cit> . in our study, administration of 20 μg bag alone did not alter survival rates in mice, whereas bag with lt augmented the death of mice as compared with lt treatment alone. these results indicate that bag can induce anthrax pathogenesis with other components such as lt, although bag alone is not sufficient to induce lethality in mice.

lt is a major virulence factor for anthrax pathogenesis  <cit> , and it is believed to be responsible for causing the death of infected organisms  <cit> . moreover, lt induces the death of macrophages derived from certain inbred rodent strains via activation of caspase- <dig> and nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing protein 1b   <cit> . nalp <dig>  a member of the nod-like receptors family, directly binds to apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a card  and caspase- <dig> through its pyrin domain and caspase recruitment domain, respectively, to form an inflammasome, which results in macrophage death. the nalp <dig> locus in mice possesses three paralogs, nalp1a, nalp1b, and nalp1c  <cit> . nalp1b is highly polymorphic in rodent strains and has been reported to determine macrophage sensitivity to lt  <cit> . lt rapidly induces capase-1–dependent pyroptosis in macrophages carrying the lt-sensitive allele of nalp1b , whereas lt slowly induces caspase-1–independent apoptosis in lt-resistant macrophages  through cleavage of meks  <cit> . however, multiple reports have documented inconsistent lt-mediated macrophage death  <cit> . indeed, lt induces apoptosis of activated macrophages with the lt-sensitive allele of nalp1b  by inhibiting p <dig> kinase but not through caspase- <dig> activation  <cit> . additionally, tnf-α produced by bacterial components promotes lt-mediated cell death in lt-resistant macrophages but not in lt-sensitive macrophages  <cit> . conversely, tnf-α is involved in lt-mediated cell death in lt-sensitive bovine macrophages  <cit> . in agreement with this previous report, we observed greater cell death by lt and bag than by lt alone in lt-sensitive macrophages and mice.

the inflammatory response is beneficial to the host, as it helps the host eliminate pathogens. however, excessive immune responses can be deleterious to the host because they can result in tissue damage or organ dysfunction including sepsis  <cit> . tnf-α is a pleiotropic cytokine that not only is involved in the growth, differentiation, and cell death of many cell types but also is implicated in pathophysiological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, and viral hepatitis  <cit> . tnf-α is a key mediator of septic shock syndrome and apoptosis of macrophages induced by bacterial endotoxin  <cit> . treatment with tnf-α is sufficient to induce death in various cell types including hepatocytes, preadipocytes, and fibroblasts  <cit> . tnf-α is also crucially involved in macrophage death mediated by b. anthracis lt alone or lt together with pgn, pga, or lps  <cit> . indeed, a sublytic dose of lt alone induces tnf-α secretion in macrophages, and pretreatment with a tnf-α–neutralizing antibody attenuates lt-induced macrophage death  <cit> . in addition, lt in combination with bacterial components such as lps, pgn, and pga promotes lt-mediated macrophage death, which is attenuated by pretreatment with a tnf-α–neutralizing antibody  <cit> . as those previous reports, administration of an anti-tnf-α monoclonal antibody, inflximab, significantly reversed the bag + lt-mediated lethality of mice in our study.

recently, a number of studies have shown that lt could cause increase of vascular permeability and following vascular leakage, thereby contributing to shock and death of animals  <cit> . bacterial constituents such as lps and bacterial dna have been known to induce increase of vascular permeability and leakage  <cit> . in addition, tnf-α could also induce the vascular leakage  <cit>  and inhibitor of tnf-α reduced lps-induced vascular leakage  <cit> . during anthrax infection, b. anthracis has been known to reach 107- <dig> organisms per milliliter of blood and induce high amount of cytokines such as tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il-1β in primary macrophages and an experimental animal model  <cit> . thus, bag-induced tnf-α production by immune cells such as macrophages might enhance vascular leakage and septic shock, thereby contributing to lethality of an infected organism. tnf-α produced by other bacterial components described above would contribute to septic shock of an infected animal through various mechanisms.

our results showed that bag led to significant increase in tnf-α secretion. therefore, tnf-α that is produced as a result of the presence of both bag and lt may enhance lt-mediated macrophage death. in the case of b. anthracis, tnf-α may also be involved in spore-induced sepsis in anthrax pathogenesis. delayed death was observed in b. anthracis spore–infected mice after treatment with a tnf-α antibody  <cit> . in our study, at 24 h post-infection with b. anthracis spores, the amount of bag circulating in the blood was < <dig>  μg/ml, but it may increase as anthrax infection develops in mice, resulting in tnf-α production. in our study, the maximal concentration of bag in in vitro culture supernatants reached to  <dig>  μg/ml when bacterial density was  <dig>  × 105 cfu/ml . during anthrax infection in animal models, it was reported that the concentration of b. anthracis in blood may rise up to 107-108 cfu/ml  <cit> . based on these observations including us, it is possible that the concentration of bag in the blood of infected animal in the late phase of infection would be high enough to induce tnf-α. additionally, it has been reported that some components of b. anthracis such as pgn, anthrolysin o, and pga induced considerable amount of tnf-α in host immune cells  <cit> . therefore, tnf-α secretion by bag as well as by other components of b. anthracis could contribute to pathogenesis of anthrax. therefore, we propose that the presence of bag circulating in the blood may enhance the toxic effects of lt by increasing the tnf-α level.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study demonstrates that bag during anthrax infection is recognized by tlr <dig> and this recognition stimulates tnf-α production via mapk and nf-κb pathways in mouse macrophages. during infection, secreted tnf-α due to bag-mediated tlr <dig> activation as well as activation by other components of b. anthracis might enhance lt-mediated macrophage cytotoxicity and eventually increases the lethality of mice.
