BACKGROUND
riboflavin  is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide  and flavin adenine dinucleotide , essential cofactors for many metabolic enzymes involved in multiple cellular processes, such as mitochondrial electron transport chain  and cellular redox regulation in other cellular compartments  <cit> . flavin-mediated redox is critical for the generation of reactive oxygen species  of different types  <cit> , such as superoxide radical o2•–  <cit>  and hydrogen peroxide h2o <dig>  <cit> . h2o <dig> is a more stable ros form, than o2•– for example, and thus frequently functions as a cellular signal to regulate multiple aspects of plant development  <cit> .

ros can be generated by a number of redox processes outside and inside plant cells  <cit> . an intracellular source of ros is redox-associated electron-carrier protein complexes i to iv in metc  <cit> . if metc functions normally, an electron tetrad  in each transport round is transferred through the carrier-protein complexes to a single o <dig> accepter, which reduces o <dig> to form h2o with protons from coenzymes nadh <dig>  and fadh <dig>  <cit> . under metc dysfunction, single electrons are transferred to o <dig> to generate o2•–, which is further converted to h2o <dig>  <cit> . this process is known as electron leakage and increases cytosolic concentrations of h2o <dig> through subcellular trafficking  <cit> . electron leakage and h2o <dig> generation may take place in protein complexes i, ii, and iii in living organisms including plants  <cit> . electron leakage and h2o <dig> generation subsequent to complex i inhibition by rotenone, a ketonic chemical compound that interferes with metc, have been well demonstrated in animals  <cit> . because fmn/fmnh <dig> and fad/fadh <dig> serve as redox centers in complexes i and ii, respectively, flavins are likely to play a pivotal role in electron leakage and h2o <dig> generation from metc  <cit> .

in agreement with this notion, recently we demonstrated that cell cytosolic h2o <dig> concentrations could be altered by modulating concentrations of free flavins  in leaves of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . flavin concentrations were modulated by de novo expression of the turtle  gene encoding riboflavin-binding protein . this protein contains a nitroxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain, which is implicated in molecular interactions, and a carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation domain, which accommodates the riboflavin molecule  <cit> . in the rfbp-expressing  arabidopsis plants, rfbp localizes to chloroplasts and binds with riboflavin, resulting in significant decreases of free flavin concentrations. this change accompanies an elevation in the cytosolic level of h2o <dig>  all these rfbp-conferred responses can be eliminated by nullifying rfbp production under rfbp+ background, and the rfbp gene silencing  arabidopsis lines resemble the wild-type  plant in flavin and h2o <dig> concentrations  <cit> . thus, the alteration of flavin content is an initial force for h2o <dig> generation in the plant cytosol. nevertheless, how altered flavin content induces h2o <dig> generation was unclear.

h2o <dig> has been implicated in flowering time control  <cit>  by the photoperiod pathway, which comprises a number of regulators  <cit> . an essential regulator, the bzip transcription factor flowering locus d , functions to activate the floral meristem identity  gene apetala <dig> , which marks the beginning of floral organ formation at the shoot apex  <cit> . at the shoot apex, fd and ap <dig> are coordinately expressed to promote the growth of floral organ primordia  <cit> . the circadian clock is a central player of the photoperiod pathway  <cit> , and h2o <dig> serves as an input signal that affects the transcriptional output of the clock and flowering time  <cit> . flowering is promoted when the cytosolic h2o <dig> level is increased, for example, by enhanced activities of chloroplastic lipoxygenase and ascorbate peroxidase in arabidopsis  <cit> .

in addition to increasing h2o <dig>  downregulation of leaf flavin content by rfbp also induces early flowering in relation to enhanced expression of floral promoting genes  <cit> . early flowering was a serendipitous phenomenon  <cit>  and was prudently characterized as a constant phenotype of rfbp+ plants  <cit> . this phenotype was eliminated when leaf flavins were brought back by rfbp− to the steady-state levels. rfbp-induced early flowering was correlated with enhanced foliar expression of floral promoting photoperiod genes, but not related to genes in vernalization, autonomous, and gibberellin pathways  <cit> , which provide flowering regulation mechanisms alternative to the photoperiod  <cit> . rfbp-upregulated photoperiod genes encode red/far red light receptor phytochrome phya, blue light receptor cryptochromes cry <dig> and cry <dig>  circadian clock oscillator timing of cab expression <dig> , and putative zinc finger transcription factor constans  proteins  <cit> . phya, cry <dig>  and cry <dig> serve as the entry of the clock and transmit the light signal to the central oscillator, which deploys a toc1-partnering transcriptional feedback loop to control day-night rhythm of photoperiod gene expression  <cit>  and the production of co as an output of the clock and an activator of the florigen gene ft in leaves  <cit> . thus, rfbp-induced early flowering is attributable to the photoperiod pathway. rfbp-induced early flowering also correlates with increased expression of fd and ap <dig> at the shoot apex  <cit> , suggesting the role of rfbp in concurrently enhancing the expression of flowering-related genes assigned to photoperiod, floral regulation, and fmi categories. by contrast, the expression of ft and photoperiod genes in leaves and the expression of fd and ap <dig> in the shoot apex were no longer enhanced when the rfbp gene was silenced, rfbp protein production canceled, and flavin concentrations were brought back to the steady-state levels  <cit> , confirming the initial effects of rfbp modulation on the sequential responses. these findings indicate that leaf flavin content downregulation by rfbp induces early flowering coincidently with increased content of cytosolic h2o <dig> and enhanced expression of genes that promote flowering through the photoperiod pathway. however, causal relationships of these responses were unknown. here, we focus on a particular question: how is h2o <dig> induced to affect flowering time under rfbp+ background?

in the plant cell, h2o <dig> can be generated by multiple sources, such as peroxisomal redox  <cit> , chloroplastic metabolisms  <cit> , transcriptional regulation related to growth and development  <cit> , and metc as well  <cit> . however, which of these sources is related to flowering time control was unknown. in this study, we elucidate that leaf flavin content downregulation by rfbp  <cit>  induces h2o <dig> generation presumably through electron leakage from metc and this source of h2o <dig> causes a promoting effect on flowering in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
rfbp induces early flowering and expression of fd and ap <dig> genes
previously we tested wt, rfbp+, and rfbp− plants under typical short days , atypical short days , typical long days , or inductive photoperiod   <cit> . to simplify experimental conditions in this study, we investigated those plants grown in typical long days and under this condition we confirmed de novo expression of the rfbp gene in rfbp+ and gene silencing in rfbp−. the gene was highly expressed  and a substantial quantity of the rfbp protein was produced  in leaves of rfbp+ in contrast to the absence of gene expression and protein production in the wt plant. the gene expression and protein production were markedly reduced in the rfbp− plant . flowering was promoted in rfbp+ compared to wt or rfbp− plants . wt plants needed 24 days to flower with  <dig> rosette leaves . rfbp− resembled wt in flowering time and rosette leaf number while rfbp+ flowered 6 days earlier with a reduction of  <dig> rosette leaves than wt . then, we studied the floral initiation marker gene ap <dig> and its regulator gene fd because enhanced expression of both genes well reflects the molecular basis of rfbp-induced early flowering  <cit> . we found that fd and ap <dig> displayed higher expression levels in rfbp+ than in wt and rfbp− plants on 12 days after stratification, 6 days before rfbp+ flowering in typical long days . therefore, it is pertinent that we further explore the molecular mechanism that underpins rfbp-induced early flowering under typical long day condition.figure  <dig>

flavin downregulation by rfbp represses expression of metc genes
based on the rfbp-regulated transcriptome profiling by the affymetrix arabidopsis genome ath <dig> array , expression levels of  <dig> of  <dig> metc genes were reduced  <dig> to  <dig> times in rfbp+ compared to the wt plant . the rest six genes encode:  nadh dehydrogenase  fe-s protein;  iron-sulfur protein a;  iron-sulfur protein b;  iron-sulfur protein c;  flavoprotein and  alternative oxidase. proteins encoded by rfbp-repressed metc genes in order are:  nadh-ubiquinone  oxidoreductase-related,;  nadhu oxidoreductase-related;  nadhu oxidoreductase b <dig> subunit;  nadhu oxidoreductase 19-kd subunit  family protein;  pridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase family protein;  ubiquinol-cytochrome  c reductase  complex  <dig> -kd protein, putative;  putative uccr complex coq-biding protein;  putative uccr complex coq-biding protein;  cyt c oxidase  copper chaperone family protein;  ucco subunit 6b, putative;  mitochondrial atp synthase g subunit family protein;  mitochondrial atp synthase g subunit family protein; and  mitochondrial atp synthase episilon chain. in this list, the last three proteins function in the production of energy and the first  <dig> ones are all required for electron transport, initiated by nadh in complex i and finished by cty in complex iv  <cit>  .figure  <dig> 
the effect of rfbp on metc gene expression. the mapman program  <cit>  was employed to analyze previously obtained data , show scaled reciprocal values of ratios of gene expression levels between rfbp+ and wt plants, and locate rfbp-affected genes with colored square patterns and other genes with grey dots in metc. electron-carrier protein complexes and redox centers are indicated. in the mapman map, rfbp-repressed genes are digitally coded  and the other genes are numbered with superscript commas. rfbp-repressed metc gene numbers 1– <dig> were used constantly in this figure and figures  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  see text for products encoded by metc genes.



the array result was confirmed by quantitative real-time rt-pcr analyses of gene expression in leaves. based on ratios of transcript quantities to the constitutively expressed ef1α gene used as a reference, expression levels of the  <dig> metc genes were significantly  lower in rfbp+ than in wt plants . the difference was more explicitly recognized by presentation of rfbp+ to wt ratios of gene transcript amounts . quantitative analyses did not detect evident repression of metc gene expression in rfbp− plants. instead, the  <dig> metc genes were expressed similarly in rfbp− and wt leaves . this, repression of metc gene expression was caused by de novo expression of rfbp.figure  <dig>

we analyzed the relationship between the dual roles of rfbp in reducing metc gene expression and flavin concentrations. the  <dig> rfbp-repressed genes function in electron-carrier protein complexes i to iv while i and ii employ fmn/fmnh <dig> and fad/fadh <dig> as redox centers, respectively  <cit> . thus, the suppression of metc gene expression might be attributed to flavin content reduction by rfbp. this hypothesis was validated by the pharmacological study in which plants were fed with an aqueous riboflavin solution or treated with water in the experimental control group. the  <dig> metc genes were expressed to greater extents in all plants following riboflavin feeding treatment compared to control, and in riboflavin-fed rfbp+ plants all of gene transcripts were retrieved approximately to the levels in water-treated wt plants . meanwhile, the intrinsic flavin concentrations were increased in all plants following riboflavin feeding treatment, and flavin levels in riboflavin-fed rfbp+ plants were retrieved approximately to the steady-state level in water-treated wt plants . rfbp− performed similarly to wt in the riboflavin-feeding effect on flavin concentrations . based on statistical analyses, differences between rfbp+ and wt or rfbp− plants in metc gene expression levels and the effects of riboflavin feeding treatment were constant and significant  for every gene . therefore, the suppression of metc gene expression is attributable to flavin content downregulation by rfbp.figure  <dig>

repressed metc gene expression accompanies h2o <dig> generation presumably through electron leakage
as stated above, the repression of metc gene expression might impair metc functions and cause h2o <dig> generation through electron leakage. electrons leak mainly from electron-carrier protein complex i or iii and occasionally from complex ii  <cit> . because the redox center is fmn/fmnh <dig> in complex i and fad/fadh <dig> in complex ii , flavin content reduction by rfbp is likely to impair functions of both complexes and induce electron leakage. to verify this hypothesis, we tested h2o <dig> in leaves of wt, rfbp+, and rfbp− plants following riboflavin feeding treatment since the treatment eliminated the inhibitive effect of rfbp on metc genes  and restores rfbp+ to wt in flowering time  <cit> .

fluorescent h2o <dig> probes amplex red  and amplex ultra red  were employed to visualize h2o <dig> in arabidopsis cells. in reaction with h2o <dig>  ar and aur are converted into resorufin and a resorufin analog, respectively, which emit strong crimson fluorescence  <cit> . ar can penetrate the plasma membrane and thus probes h2o <dig> in the cytosol, whereas, aur can not penetrate the plasma membrane and thus probes h2o <dig> present in the apoplastic space  <cit> . apoplastic and cytosolic h2o <dig> signals reported by aur and ar, respectively, are shown in figure 5b. aur staining signals were weak and similar in all plants irrespectively of treatment with riboflavin or with water as a control, suggesting low steady-state levels of the apoplastic h2o <dig> that was unaffected by rfbp or riboflavin. by contrast, ar staining signals were stronger in all plants treated with water compared to riboflavin, suggesting that riboflavin feeding treatment decreased the quantity of cytosolic h2o <dig>  especially, rfbp+ plants displayed the strongest signal with water treatment but the signal was highly reduced by riboflavin feeding treatment. thus, rfbp-induced h2o <dig> mainly accumulates in the cytosol and can be decreased by feeding plants with riboflavin.

leaf h2o <dig> concentrations were measured. with water treatment, h2o <dig> levels were approximately  <dig> -fold higher in rfbp+ than in wt or rfbp− . riboflavin feeding treatment significantly  decreased h2o <dig> concentrations in all plants. unexpectedly, h2o <dig> concentrations in riboflavin-fed rfbp+ plants were reduced only by 55%, from  <dig> to 372 ng/mg fresh leaf weight, still significantly  lower than in water-treated wt  or rfbp−  plants . in all cases, however, h2o <dig> and flavin levels  were correlated with expression extents of metc genes . these analyses are in agreement with h2o <dig> imaging assays and both lines of evidence suggest the possibility that increased cytosolic h2o <dig> results from electron leakage in flavin-dependent metc.

this notion was supported indirectly by analyses of metc gene expression and h2o <dig> concentrations in plants treated with rotenone, a ketonic chemical that inhibits electron-carrier protein complex i and induces electron leakage from this complex  <cit> . rotenone was dissolved in ethanol and used as a water-diluted solution containing  <dig> % ethanol to treat plants, and plants were treated with  <dig> % ethanol in the experimental control group. equivalent quantities of the  <dig> transcripts were detected in rotenone-treated and control plants irrespectively of genotype, wt or rfbp+ . in rfbp+, however, rotenone treatment further reduced gene expression levels on the basis of rfbp-caused repression . this analysis indicated that rotenone and rfbp had a similar effect on the expression of metc genes. in contrast to the inhibitory effect on metc gene expression, rotenone treatment increased h2o <dig> concentrations in all plants . h2o <dig> concentrations in rotenone-treated wt and rfbp− plants were elevated approximately to 90% of that in water-treated rfbp+ plants, indicating the similar function of rotenone and rfbp. moreover, rotenone appeared to synergize the role of rfbp in increasing h2o <dig> concentrations as h2o <dig> in rfbp+ was near 50% increased by rotenone compared to control. the similar effects of rotenone and rfbp on metc gene expression and h2o <dig> concentrations  suggest that rfbp induces h2o <dig> generation possibly through electron leakage.figure  <dig>

rfbp-induced h2o <dig> contributes to early flowering
all plants flowered later with more rosette leaves when h2o <dig> concentrations were decreased by riboflavin feeding treatment compared to treatment with water in control . the delayed flowering phenotype was coincident with decreased expression of the fd and ap <dig> genes in shoot apices of plants fed with riboflavin , which increases expression levels of metc genes in all plants and especially eliminate the inhibitory effect of rfbp on metc gene expression in rfbp+ . in rfbp+, riboflavin feeding treatment retrieved leaf flavins , the expression of metc genes , fd and ap <dig> genes  to approximations of wt levels, and decreased h2o <dig> concentrations but did not fully cancel the rfbp-induced quantity . in this case, rfbp+ no longer displayed the early flowering phenotype; instead, they flowered approximately as wt or rfbp− plants . these analyses indicate that rfbp-induced h2o <dig> contributes to the early flowering phenotype in correlation with enhanced expression of fd and ap <dig> genes in the shoot apex.figure  <dig>

the extrinsic application of h2o <dig> promotes flowering
to confirm the promoting effect of h2o <dig> on flowering, we performed pharmacological studies in which plants were treated with h2o <dig> only or in combination with h2o <dig> scavenger catalase. both compounds were used in aqueous solutions to immerse seeds and treat 10-day-old plants grown on agar medium. we first treated wt seeds and plants with a range of h2o <dig> concentrations and two days later we found that 4 mm h2o <dig> well enhanced the expression of fd and ap <dig> in shoot apices  and increased the intrinsic level of h2o <dig> in leaves . we further found that 4 mm h2o <dig> was effective to induce early flowering and reduce rosette leaf number . however, h2o <dig> treatment did not cause evident changes in expression levels of metc genes . then, we treated seeds and plants with water in control and with 4 mm h2o <dig> or a mixture of 4 mm h2o <dig> plus <dig> u/ml catalase. we found significant  increases in the intrinsic h2o <dig> content  and enhancements of fd and ap <dig> expression , and we also observed the early flowering phenotype , in all plants treated with h2o <dig> compared to water. however, these effects were removed by the presence of catalase in the h2o <dig> treatment . thus, the extrinsically applied h2o <dig> caused a promoting effect on flowering. more precocious flowering and greater increases in the intrinsic h2o <dig> and in fd and ap <dig> expression levels were observed in rfbp+ compared to wt and rfbp− plants under the same treatment conditions . presumably, the extrinsic  and intrinsic  h2o <dig> cooperates to promote flowering and enhance fd and ap <dig> expression at the shoot apex.figure  <dig>

h2o <dig> from different sources contributes to the similar effect on flowering
to elucidate whether h2o <dig> from different cellular sources contributes to the similar effect on flowering, we determined h2o <dig> concentrations, fd and ap <dig> gene expression, and flowering time of arabidopsis cat <dig> and nfxl <dig> mutants in comparison with wt and rfbp+ plants. due to a mutation in peroxisomal enzyme catalase  <dig> , the cat <dig> mutant loses 80% of catalase activity and produces a higher level of the cytosolic h2o <dig> compared to the wt plant  <cit> . this was confirmed in this study by measuring leaf h2o <dig> concentrations, being 43% higher in cat <dig>  than in wt  . compared to wt, cat <dig> displayed higher levels of fd and ap <dig> expression and was 10 days earlier to flower . as an indirect result of disruption in the transcription factor nfxl <dig>  the nfxl <dig> mutant incurs a 20% decrease of the cytosolic h2o <dig> in relative to the steady-state level  <cit> . compared to wt, nfxl <dig> had lower levels of cytosolic h2o <dig> and fd and ap <dig> expression and displayed the late flowering phenotype leaves . these analyses suggest that h2o <dig> from the different sources, cat <dig> or nfxl <dig> defection and rfbp as well, functions similarly to affect flowering time and the expression of fd and ap <dig> 

rfbp compensates for flowering repression in the nfxl <dig> mutant
because rfbp+ and nfxl <dig> are opposite and likely to counteract the role in h2o <dig> content alterations and the effect on flowering, both plants were crossed and the rfbp+nfxl <dig> hybrid was generated for further analyses. metc genes were expressed similarly in rfbp+nfxl <dig> and rfbp+ plants , suggesting that the nfxl <dig> mutation was unrelated to metc gene expression. however, the hybrid appeared to be intermediate of both parents in the cytosolic h2o <dig> content , levels of fd and ap <dig> expression , flowering time , and rosette leaf number . clearly, rfbp+ compensates for flowering repression in the nfxl <dig> mutant.figure  <dig>

discussion
this study was attempted to mainly elucidate how h2o <dig> is induced by rfbp to affect flowering time on the basis of our recent evidence that early flowering is a constant phenotype conferred by de novo expression of the turtle rfbp gene and associated with a constant increase of leaf h2o <dig> concentrations and timely enhanced expression of fd and ap <dig> at the shoot apex in rfbp+ arabidopsis plants under short days, long days, or inductive photoperiod  <cit> . under these conditions, enhanced expression of fd and ap <dig> is essential for floral organ formation at the shoot apex  <cit>  and well reflects the molecular basis of rfbp-induced early flowering  <cit> . in this study, we simplified the experiment system by growing plants only in long days and under this condition we correlated the early flowering phenotype with enhanced expression of fd and ap <dig>  floral regulatory and fmi genes, respectively . data obtained from multiple experimental repetitions demonstrated that:  rfbp represses the expression of  <dig> of  <dig> metc genes  and induces h2o <dig> probably results from electron leakage at metc ;  h2o <dig> promotes flowering and enhances the expression of fd and ap <dig> ; and  the potential electron leakage appears to be one of biochemical sources for the generation of h2o <dig> with the promoting effect on flowering . previously we showed that the foreign rfbp protein is capable of modulating the intrinsic content of free flavins with physiological and pathological consequences. inside the rfbp+ cell, rfbp binds with riboflavin, reduces quantities of free flavins in leaves, and concomitantly elevates concentrations of the cytosolic h2o <dig>  which acts in turn to regulate defense responses to a bacterial pathogen  <cit> . therefore, flavin content downregulation by the foreign rfbp protein has developmental and defensive consequences.

in recent 10 years, genetic modification of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway alters some aspects of plant development, such as leaf senescence regulated by the cos <dig> protein characteristic of lumazine synthase, which catalyzes the penultimate step of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway  <cit>  and is an essential component of jasmonic acid signaling pathway  <cit> . in plants, moreover, externally applied riboflavin induces plant growth enhancement by activating ethylene signaling pathway  <cit> . externally applied riboflavin also induces resistance to pathogens in a manner of salicylic acid dependence or independence according to the type of pathogens  <cit> . these findings suggest that changes in riboflavin content cause physiological and pathological responses by affecting phytohormone signaling pathways. based on our studies detailed here and reported earlier  <cit> , novel functions of flavins have been extended from hormone signaling to flowering time control.

early flowering associates with spontaneously repressed expression of  <dig> of  <dig> metc genes  and concomitantly elevated cytosolic h2o <dig> concentrations  in rfbp+ plants. the repression on metc genes is attributable to decreased concentrations of free flavins in leaves and can be removed either by rfbp− or by riboflavin feeding treatment under rfbp+ background . based on the roles of rfbp− and riboflavin feeding in restoring rfbp+ to wt in flavin content and flowering time, as well as different extents by which riboflavin feeding and rfbp increase h2o <dig> concentrations , increased h2o <dig> is at least partially caused by rfbp-reduced flavin content and contributes to the early flowering phenotype. on one hand, direct evidence for the promoting effect of h2o <dig> on flowering was found in the pharmacological analysis with h2o <dig> and catalase . on the other hand, the coincident decreases in levels of three flavins  conform to dynamics of flavin form conversions. riboflavin and fmn conversion is reversible  <cit> , while fmn to fad conversion is irreversible  <cit> . accumulation of a particular flavin is concentration-dependent, so that a smaller amount of free riboflavin or fmn results in a smaller amount of fmn or fad  <cit> . therefore, downregulation of free riboflavin is an initial cause of coordinate decreases of free fmn and fad concentrations and is also a cause of the subsequent effect on flowering time under rfbp+ background. in rfbp+, however, although riboflavin feeding treatment only increases h2o <dig> but does not retrieve it to the wt level , the treatment enables rfbp+ to resemble wt in flavin content, the expression of metc, fad, and ap <dig> genes, and flowering time in particular . this discrepancy indicates that downregulating flavin content is not the only mechanism by which rfbp induces h2o <dig> and early flowering. alternatively, the extrinsically applied riboflavin is insufficiently effective as the intrinsically produced flavins to affect cellular redox. at this point, we are unable to pertinently prospect the relationship between flavin-mediated redox and flowering time control based on the riboflavin-feeding experiment.

regarding to the riboflavin-feeding effect, a question is how the extrinsically applied riboflavin increases the intrinsic flavin concentrations. in plants, riboflavin synthesis, its conversion to fmn, and fmn conversion to fad are predicted to occur in plastids  <cit> . with the cell growth, plastids differentiate into chloroplasts  <cit> , in which rfbp is localized  <cit> . flavins are transported by subcellular trafficking and function in processes such as metc  <cit> . in animals, rfbp functions to mediate the cellular translocation of riboflavin  <cit> . animals absorb riboflavin directly from dietary sources  <cit>  or produce this vitamin through conversions from ingested fmn and fad  <cit> . in both cases, rfbp acts to redistribute riboflavin between cellular compartments, between cells, and from one organ to another  <cit> . a similar trafficking mechanism may be responsible for transport of the extrinsic riboflavin into plant cells but this hypothesis remains to be examined.

regarding to the effects of rfbp on flavin levels and metc gene expression, an important question is how rfbp-decreased flavin concentrations cause h2o <dig> generation potentially through electron leakage. because electron-carrier protein complexes i and ii involve the first five of rfbp-repressed  <dig> genes, and employ fmn/fmnh <dig> and fad/fadh <dig> as redox centers , respectively, electrons may leak from both complexes due to rfbp-reduced flavin concentrations, resulting in increased concentrations of the cytosolic h2o <dig> . this postulation was indirectly supported by circumstantial evidence as following:  similar dual roles that rotenone and shortage of flavins play in repressing metc gene expression and increasing h2o <dig> ;  the ternary effects of riboflavin feeding in increasing the intrinsic flavin and metc gene expression levels but decreasing h2o <dig> concentrations ; and  the lack of effect of the externally applied h2o <dig> on metc gene expression . in addition, a key point in  and  is that the increase of h2o <dig> concentrations is a result, but not a cause, of repressed metc gene expression. these analyses suggest the possibility that flavin shortage due to downregulation by rfbp causes the repressive effect as does the toxicity of rotenone  <cit>  on metc to induce electron leakage.

mechanisms by which rotenone and rfbp repress metc gene expression may be different according to natures of rotenone rfbp, as well as components and functions of metc. rotenone is a broad-spectrum insecticide, pesticide, and piscicide, is toxic to metc, impairs the role of electron carrier-protein complex i  <cit>  in transport of electron tetrad to single o <dig> accepter, and inhibits o <dig> reduction to form h2o with protons from nadh <dig> and fadh <dig>  <cit> . as regards the effect of rfbp, rfbp-caused shortage of fmn and fad  <cit>  may lead to insufficient functions of fmn to receive protons from nadph in complex i and fad to supply protons for coq in complex ii . electron leakage and h2o <dig> generation subsequent to complex i inhibition by rotenone have been well studied in animals  <cit> , but little was known about whether plants incur a similar inhibition. owing to the alternative oxidization bypass located between complex iii and the inner membrane-associated coq, inhibition by rotenone may not cause electron leakage from complex iii, but electrons are still likely to leak from complex i or ii  <cit> . moreover, inhibition of plant complex i expands impacts far beyond the complex itself since a number of metabolic pathways associated with mitochondria and other organelles are altered concomitantly  <cit> . this also explains a possible way, alternative to reducing flavin content, by which rfbp affects h2o <dig> accumulation and flowering time. repressing metc gene expression seems to be a mode of the rotenone action on metc so that the consequence is similar in rotenone-treated wt and water-treated rfbp+ plants . at present, however, there is no evidence to elucidate the mechanism by which rotenone causes repression of metc gene expression.

in addition to electron leakage from metc, h2o <dig> can be generated by many other mechanisms at different sites in plant cells through flavin-mediated cytosolic and peroxisomal redox processes  <cit> . cytosolic and peroxisomal redox genes whose expression levels are more than 50% reduced by rfbp encode single alutaredoxin , thioredoxin , and peroxiredoxin type  <dig>  proteins and three glutaredoxin  proteins . all these proteins are h2o <dig> scavengers and may function concomitantly with the potential electron leakage mechanism to elevate cytosolic concentrations of h2o <dig> and affect flowering time. as stated above, therefore, the repressive effect on metc gene expression is not the only mechanism by which rfbp induces h2o <dig> and promotes flowering under rfbp+ background. testing of this hypothesis obviously needs numerous challenged genetic, biochemical, and molecular studies. in the present study, we are only able to provide indirect evidence that rfbp+ and nfxl <dig> plants mutually counteract in altering cytosolic h2o <dig> concentrations and in the subsequent effects on flowering time and expression of fd and ap <dig> at the shoot apex .

with respect to h2o <dig> generation and function at different sites in plant cells, a critical question is related to cellular translocation of h2o <dig>  or how mitochondrial h2o <dig> is recruited into flowering time control? compared to the apoplastic-cytoplasmic translocation  <cit> , intracellular translocation of h2o <dig> subsequent to generation in different cellular compartments may play more important roles in regulating multiple physiological processes  <cit> . the supposed h2o <dig> translocation may not depend on free diffusion, but instead, it may comply with certain modes of the selectivity  <cit> . in a great attention, the aquaporin channel originally assigned to water transport  <cit>  has been implicated in cellular translocation of other small compounds  <cit>  including h2o <dig>  <cit> . particular aquaporins may mediate h2o <dig> translocation for its recruitment into flowering time control. this hypothesis needs to be tested.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that rfbp-induced h2o <dig> presumably results from metc electron leakage due to flavin downregulation by rfbp, h2o <dig> is a positive regulator of flowering, and the hypothetical electron leakage appears to be one of biochemical sources of h2o <dig> with the promoting effect on flowering. in fact, early flowering is a serendipitous phenomenon associated with the de novo expression of rfbp, but we don’t exactly know what it means with respect to flavin-mediated redox and flowering time control.
