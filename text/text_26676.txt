BACKGROUND
recent progress in the development of genomic techniques, including next generation sequencers, has greatly facilitated transcriptome analysis of ecologically important animals to reveal variations in mrna expression patterns among closely related species and ecotypes within species  <cit> . divergence in mrna expression patterns is known to contribute to phenotypic evolution  <cit> , although amino acid alterations in proteins are also important  <cit> . while a great deal is known about variation in mrna expression profiles, information regarding naturally occurring variation in the expression patterns of small rnas is limited, except for a few cases in plants  <cit>  and cichlids  <cit> .

non-coding small rnas, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length, mediate the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . the members of one class of small rnas, micrornas , are typically 20– <dig> nucleotides long and are highly conserved across diverse taxa  <cit> . mirna post-transcriptionally regulates messenger rna . a mirna interacts with ten to hundreds of target mrnas to induce degradation or suppress translation  <cit> . another function of mirna is epigenetic modification of genomic dna: mirnas interact with target dnas to alter the chromatin state and suppress mrna transcription  <cit> . mirnas comprise more than 1% of animal genes  <cit> , suggesting that they play important roles in many biological processes. recent functional studies in laboratory model animals such as mice, flies, and nematodes have demonstrated that mirnas are important for regulating development, growth, pathogen resistance, and neural functions  <cit> .

another class of small rnas is the piwi-interacting rnas , which are typically 24– <dig> nucleotides long and interact with piwi proteins to suppress the expression of transposons and other functional genes  <cit> . pirnas often possess uridine at the 5’-end   <cit> . pirnas are expressed from intergenic repetitive elements, active transposons, and pirna clusters. importantly, pirnas may contribute to hybrid dysgenesis  <cit> . for example, some drosophila strains contain transposons as well as pirnas that inhibit transposon activity, whereas other strains lack both transposons and inhibitory pirnas. because pirnas are maternally transmitted, hybrid progeny resulting from a cross between a mother lacking both transposons and pirnas and a father possessing both will inherit the transposons, but not the inhibitory pirnas. this abnormal activity of transposons in the germ line is likely to result in sterility  <cit> . thus, maternally transmitted pirnas can explain why hybrid abnormalities are observed in only one direction of the inter-strain crosses. pirnas are expressed not only in the gonads, but also in the brain, and they may be involved in the regulation of neuronal functions  <cit> . compared with mirnas, pirnas are less well conserved across taxa. yet another class of small rnas, endogenous small interfering rnas , are usually  <dig> nucleotides and have been found in some taxa, including nematodes  <cit> , flies  <cit> , and mammals  <cit> , but it has not been well characterized in other animals.

evolutionary genetic studies examining small rnas are important for several reasons. first, genome-wide allele-specific mrna expression analyses have revealed that both cis- and trans-regulatory changes contribute to differential expression of mrnas among closely related species  <cit> . small rnas can act as trans-regulatory factors, which contribute to differential mrna expression  <cit> . additionally, cis-regulatory changes may include mutations at the target sites of small rnas  <cit> ; for example, snps and insertion-deletion polymorphisms were identified within mirna-binding sites of 3’-untranslated regions  <cit> . variations in small rna transcriptomes and sequences were found to be associated with phenotypic variation in humans and laboratory animals. for example, mirna and mirna target site polymorphisms and mutations have been found in humans and are associated with disease susceptibility  <cit> . polymorphism in a mirna target site is associated with variation of muscularity in pigs  <cit> . second, small rnas regulate translation of mrnas. therefore, transcriptome studies of mrna alone can overlook the divergence in the total outcome of gene expression among species. third, pirnas may contribute to hybrid abnormalities , but generalities regarding the roles of pirna in different types of hybrid abnormalities remain unclear.

in the present study, we compared brain small rna transcriptomes between incipient species of the threespine stickleback . the threespine stickleback is a good model for linking ecological and genetic studies of adaptive evolution and speciation  <cit> . the threespine stickleback has undergone tremendous diversification over the past few million years  <cit> . evolutionary diversification within the stickleback species complex led to a speciation continuum, which ranges from populations with interspecific phenotypic polymorphism to strong divergence with near-complete reproductive isolation  <cit> . recent genetic studies have revealed that differences in the expression of genes involved in morphological development  <cit> , physiology  <cit> , and immune function  <cit>  may underlie adaptive divergence among populations or species. sex bias of the mrna transcriptome has also been investigated, and genes located on sex chromosomes were found to be female-biased, likely owing to y-chromosome degeneration and lack of dosage compensation  <cit> . however, transcriptome analysis of small rnas has not yet been conducted in any stickleback system.

this study focused on japanese threespine stickleback species pairs, including a pacific ocean form and a japan sea form. these sticklebacks diverged during a period of geographical isolation between the sea of japan and the pacific ocean approximately  <dig> – <dig> million years ago  <cit> . currently, they are sympatric in eastern hokkaido, but they are reproductively isolated with a very low level of hybridization  <cit> . in the japan sea form, a chromosomal fusion occurred between linkage group   <dig> and the ancestral y chromosome , resulting in the evolution of the x1x2y multiple sex chromosome system  <cit> . in contrast, the pacific ocean form has a simple xy sex chromosome system  <cit> . previously, we found that the pacific ocean and japan sea forms diverge in male courtship behaviors and female mate choice behaviors, contributing to behavioral isolation between these two forms  <cit> . furthermore, we found that divergence in the intensity of courtship behaviour, which is important for mate choice, mapped to a neo-sex chromosome .

to better understand the genetic mechanisms affecting behavioral differences between this japanese stickleback species pair, it is essential to understand divergence in small rna transcriptomes of the brain. both mirnas and pirnas play important roles in a diverse array of neuronal functions such as neuronal differentiation, neural stem cell renewal, neuronal outgrowth, and dendritic spine morphogenesis  <cit> . furthermore, variation in mirna expression patterns in the brain may contribute to behavioral differences among laboratory mouse strains  <cit> . additionally, in the japanese stickleback system, courtship dysfunction may exist in hybrids because a substantial number of hybrids did not perform any courtship behavior in a previous experiment . therefore, it is necessary to examine whether small rnas, especially pirnas, which may be regulating transposon activity in the brain, affect hybrid behavior. here, we characterized the divergence in small rna transcriptomes in the brain between the species pairs of japanese threespine stickleback.

RESULTS
mirna transcriptome
we conducted small rna sequencing of four males and four females from both the pacific ocean and the japan sea forms using the illumina genome analyzer iix. after quality control of the sequence reads, data was collected from  <dig>  ±  <dig>   million reads per fish . most of these reads  were located in the ensembl stickleback mirna database. more than 50% of these small rnas were  <dig> nucleotides in length . in total,  <dig> isoforms of mirna were detected in the brain . mirna expression profiles demonstrated that mirnas homologous to mir <dig>  mir <dig>  let <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were the most abundant in the stickleback brain, regardless of the species or sex . most other mirnas were expressed at relatively low levels .

to elucidate the variation in the mirna transcriptomes, we conducted principal component analysis . the mirna transcriptomes of the pacific ocean and the japan sea forms make distinct clusters. interestingly, the japan sea males and females make distinct clusters, whereas the mirna transcriptomes of the pacific ocean males and females overlapped. these data suggest that the magnitude of sex differences of mirna expression levels might differ between species.

we identified several mirnas that were differentially expressed between species . although quantitative trait loci  mapping revealed that lg <dig> contained a courtship display qtl, no mirnas expressed from lg <dig> showed significantly different expression levels between species after bonferroni correction . we identified a mirna homologous to the zebrafish mir <dig> that was differentially expressed between the stickleback species. in mammals, mir <dig> expression levels in the brain can change after hyperosmolar stimuli  <cit>  and regulate growth factor signalling pathways  <cit> . another mirna differentially expressed between species, mir <dig>  may be involved in axon guidance  <cit> .

sex differences in the expression levels were identified for several mirnas . interestingly, all sex-biased mirnas belonged to the let- <dig> family   <cit> . mirnas of the let- <dig> family are highly conserved across taxa and are important during development  <cit> . two sexually dimorphic mirnas  were expressed from lg19; both of these were female-biased. in species with an xy-sex chromosome system, suppression of recombination can lead to degeneration of the y chromosome  <cit> . unless dosage compensation mechanisms evolve, expression of genes located on the x-specific region becomes female-biased  <cit> . therefore, we investigated the relationship between y-degeneration and sex differences in mirna expression levels. we found that expression of all mirnas derived from the x-specific region  were female-biased, whereas expression of mirna derived from the pseudoautosomal region was not necessarily female-biased , and log <dig>  significantly differed between the pseudo-autosomal and the x-specific regions . these results suggest that y chromosome degeneration may have a substantial impact not only on mrna expression  <cit> , but also on mirna expression.

because mirnas can target many mrnas  <cit> , divergence in mirna expression patterns may have substantial effects on the expression patterns of many mrnas. further experimental studies examining the roles of small rnas in fish will be necessary to understand the functional effects of the mirna transcriptome variation. this would be possible by developing either transgenic fish specifically overexpressing small rnas or small rna-deficient knockout fish  <cit> .

small rnas homologous to repetitive sequences
small rnas with no matches in the stickleback non-coding rna database were further analyzed. a histogram of the read length of these small rnas revealed two peaks, with one peak at  <dig> nucleotides and the other at 27– <dig> nucleotides . the fraction of large-sized small rnas may contain pirnas, whereas the other fraction may correspond to novel mirnas and/or endo-sirnas. a histogram of reads per million  of the unidentified small rnas revealed that most were expressed at low levels, with only a few expressed at high levels . thirty-one novel small rnas expressed at relatively high abundance  could be classified into  <dig> isoforms on the basis of sequence identity .

a homology search against the pirnabank database revealed that some of these were similar to previously reported pirnas . additionally, seven isoforms contained 5′u , which is often found in previously reported pirnas. however, compared with mirnas, pirnas are less conserved across taxa. therefore, we examined whether these  <dig> small rnas showed homology to repetitive sequences such as transposons. for all  <dig> isoforms, multiple homologous sites were identified in the stickleback genome . most of these potential small rna target sites overlapped with repetitive sequences . four isoforms  showed a high level of homology to the non-long terminal repeat  retrotransposon. one isoform  was homologous to the ltr retrotransposon and two isoforms  were homologous to erv1-type retrovirus genes. one  was similar to a dna transposon. because we did not confirm that these sequences actually bind to piwi proteins, we could not exclude the possibility that the identified sequences are not pirnas. however, all of these were longer than  <dig> nucleotides, and some of them contained the 5′u. recent studies have demonstrated that retrotransposons are active in the adult mammalian brain and are thought to increase neuronal function diversity  <cit> . therefore, regardless of whether these sequences are pirnas, it is interesting that small rnas highly homologous to transposons are expressed in the stickleback brain.

e-value smaller than  <dig>  is shown here.

the numbers in parentheses in the blast hits indicate the number of hits on that linkage group.

the remaining six and three isoforms overlapped with repetitive sequences homologous to trna and rrna, respectively. previous studies also identified a number of trna-derived small rnas in humans  <cit> , giardia lamblia <cit> , and zebrafish  <cit> . these trna-derived small rnas may contribute to gene regulation  <cit> , although little is yet known about their functions. interestingly, some transposons are derived from trnas  <cit> , so there appears to be an interesting link between trna and small rnas.

finally, we found that the iso-smrna <dig>  whose potential targets are predicted to be non-ltr transposons, was more highly expressed in the japan sea sticklebacks than in the pacific ocean sticklebacks . although expression levels of some other pirnas may differ between different species and sexes, the differences were not significant after bonferroni correction . none of the non-annotated small rnas showed sex differences in the expression levels .

thus, we identified small rnas homologous to repetitive sequences such as rna and dna transposons. hybrids between species often exhibit courtship dysfunction  <cit> . abnormal transposon activity in hybrids may cause hybrid courtship dysfunction, but this has not been tested in any organism. intra- and inter-population variation in the presence and absence of non-ltr retrotransposons has been found in sticklebacks  <cit> . in addition, our analysis involving whole genome sequence comparisons also revealed that dna transposon insertion sites diverge between the pacific ocean and the japan sea sticklebacks . therefore, further studies examining variation in transposon activity between the different species and transposon activity in the hybrids will lead to a better understanding of speciation mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that closely related species can show divergence in expression patterns of small rnas, including mirnas and pirnas. some of the sex differences in mirna expression levels might result from y-chromosome degeneration. therefore, variation in small rna transcriptomes should be examined as a potential mechanism underlying phenotypic divergence between incipient species.
