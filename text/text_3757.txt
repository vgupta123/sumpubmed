BACKGROUND
currently, approximately 1/ <dig> of the world’s arable land faces yield reduction due to cyclical or unpredictable drought, a great threat to agricultural production  <cit> . to meet the needs of the growing world population, it is essential to effectively utilize dehydrated soil in drought-prone areas. development and planting of drought tolerant cultivars is a cost-effective and practically acceptable approach for full utilization of water-limiting soil  <cit> . however, the progress toward developing drought-tolerant crops is significantly hampered by the lack of high tolerant genetic resources and the complexity in physiological and genetic traits. it is therefore important to identify the genetic resources and to understand the mechanisms of drought tolerance in plants that could result in high levels of tolerance to drought stress.

remarkable studies have been done concerning drought tolerance in cultivated crops  <cit> . abiotic stress such as drought and salt stress induces changes of protein expression in plants  <cit> . protein expression changes in response to drought have been reported in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , sugar beet  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and sunflower  <cit> . a number of drought-induced proteins were identified involving in photosynthesis, signaling pathways, oxidative stress detoxification  <cit> . it has been reported that several proteins, with a function in the protection and repair of proteins such as the heat shock proteins , are expressed under drought stress  <cit> . pathogenesis-related  proteins have also been reported to be induced by drought stress  <cit> . huerta-ocampo et al.  <cit>  found that amaranth root response to drought stress involved the up-regulation of proteins that control damage from reactive oxygen species, a family of heat shock proteins. comparative proteomics approaches to analyze protein abundance between normal and stress-treated or tolerant and sensitive genotypes have greatly facilitated the study of plant cellular stress responses. however, only limited information is available on drought induced specific proteins in barley.

barley  is one of the most widely cultivated cereals crops in the world  <cit> . compared to the other cereals, barley plants, exhibiting high drought tolerance, are the most suitable targets of drought-related research and are the most promising sources of drought-related gene  <cit> . however, due to the rapid loss of genetic variation from cultivar replacement, modern barley cultivars have become more sensitive to abiotic and biotic stresses, and their monotonous genetic background has been an obstacle to breeding improved cultivars. wild barley offers the prospect of a ‘goldmine’ of untapped genetic reserves  <cit> . the identification of well-adapted wild relatives that are able to grow well in drought-prone soils provides a useful supply of new germplasm for future breeding. tibetan annual wild barley from qinghai-tibet plateau is regarded as one of the progenitors of cultivated barley, and it is rich in genetic diversity  <cit> . our previous study  <cit>  successfully identified two contrasting tibetan barley genotypes xz <dig>  and xz <dig>  in response to drought stress. however, the protein expression involved in response to drought stress in tibetan wild type barley have never been investigated and compared with elite cultivars under drought stress. thus, the question arises whether the mechanism for drought-tolerance in wild barley genotype xz <dig> is associated with the related protein/gene expression. if this is the case, the question arises whether the proteins associated with drought tolerance in tibetan wild barley are different from those in cultivated barley. this knowledge is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying tolerance to drought stresses in wild barley.

in this study, we investigated stress-specific proteins associated with drought tolerance in wild barley by comparing the proteomic responses of the two contrasting tibetan wild barley genotypes xz <dig> , xz <dig>  and cv. zau <dig> using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  and mass spectrometry . these results are useful to better understand the mechanisms of drought tolerance in barley, and provide an effective pathway for the exploration of drought-tolerant genes in plants.

to determine whether the changes in protein abundance detected by 2-de were correlated with changes at the transcriptome level, quantitative rt-pcr was performed using rna isolated from the leaves of a separate set of plants treated with four periods  and  <dig> %  and subsequently  <dig> days  and  <dig> days  of recovery). transcript levels of five drought inducible proteins including ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase large chain precursor, atp synthase beta subunit, heat-shock protein, os05g <dig> and atp synthase cf <dig> beta subunit  were chosen and successfully detected. among them, ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase large chain precursor, heat-shock protein and os05g <dig> were up-regulated in xz <dig> but down-regulated in xz <dig> and zau <dig>  atp synthase beta subunit and atp synthase cf <dig> beta subunit were up-regulated in xz <dig> and zau <dig> but down-regulated in xz <dig>  following the expression trend detected by 2-de .fig.  <dig> quantitative real-time pcr analysis of the five drought inducible proteins a, and correlation of qrt-pcr  and protein fold change b. barley gapdh and actin were used as the reference genes. data plotted are the mean ratio of gene/protein expression on the four sampling dates  in drought treatment over those in the control in the xz <dig>  xz <dig> and zau <dig> on a log <dig> scale . smc <dig> and smc <dig>  and r <dig> and r <dig> represent soil moisture content at  <dig> % and at  <dig> %, respectively, and after  <dig> and  <dig> days of recovery following drought stress



comparing the cds sequence of rbcl and trx-m genes from xz <dig>  xz <dig> and zau3
the protein ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase large chain precursor  and thioredoxin m-type, chloroplast precursor   were obtained by the results of 2-de, and the corresponding genes could also be found in genbank . the cds length of rbcl and trx-m genes was  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp  , respectively, encoding  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively, and both contained no introns. conserved domain prediction by smart  indicates that rbcl have two conserved domains: rubisco_large_n domain and rubisco_large_domain, their functions are ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase activity and magnesium ion binding. for rubisco_large_n domain the interval from xz <dig>  xz <dig> and zau <dig> was 21- <dig>  for rubisco_large_domain the intervals from xz <dig>  xz <dig> and zau <dig> were 154- <dig>  154- <dig>  154- <dig>  respectively. and 69- <dig> conserved thioredoxin domain interval belonged to trx-m from xz <dig>  xz <dig> and zau <dig>  their function is cell redox homeostasis. the cds and the amino acid sequence of the putative protein are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  nucleotide and amino acids sequence alignment of rbcl and trx-m from xz <dig>  xz <dig> and zau <dig>  showed that rbcl gene sequence contained  <dig> novel single nucleotide polymorphism sites  at position  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp , respectively, of which two were missense mutations, and two missense mutation occurred in the conserved domain according to the result of sequence alignment by ncbi. moreover, trx-m gene cds contained  <dig> snps which located in  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp ,  <dig> snps were all missense mutations and all occurred in the conserved domain . comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of rbcl from xz <dig>  xz <dig> and zau <dig>  indicated two amino acid residues difference between xz <dig> and xz <dig>  similarly, three amino acid residues difference among xz <dig>  xz <dig> and zau <dig>  this might give rise to differences in the protein structure, thereby affected its function  <cit> , and lead to differences in drought tolerance capacity. furthermore, snp mutations causing protein-coding changes or gene expression alterations both have the potential to account for agronomic traits  <cit> .table  <dig> the snps of rbcl and trx-m among the three genotypes xz <dig>  xz <dig> and zau3

discussion
in the present work, drought tolerant tibetan wild barley xz <dig> recorded significantly less reduction in shoot dry weight , when compared with control, than that of xz <dig> and zau <dig> in which drought stress symptom of wilt and lodging appeared rapidly and severely, the trend was the same as that of our previous study  <cit> . analysis of the proteome complement is required for a thorough understanding of the cellular processes that are associated with drought. our current data is the first study to identify drought-responsive proteins in tibetan wild barley  using a proteomic approach. the leaf proteomic study identified  <dig> protein spots associated with drought-tolerance in wild barley xz <dig> , which may be specific proteins with important roles in drought tolerance in xz <dig>  these proteins play a role in photosynthesis, biosynthesis, energy metabolism, and unknown functions. among them,  <dig> protein spots were exclusively expressed or up-regulated by drought stress in xz <dig> but not xz <dig>  including melanoma-associated antigen p <dig>  type i chlorophyll a/b-binding protein b, atp synthase cf <dig> beta subunit, ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase large chain; of which type i chlorophyll a/b-binding protein b , chloroplast transketolase  and melanoma-associated antigen p <dig>  specifically expressed in xz <dig> but not xz <dig> and zau <dig>  further investigations of these proteins may elucidate the mechanism of drought tolerance in xz <dig> and will provide new molecular resources to develop more drought-tolerant crops. the selected stress-responsive proteins are discussed below according to their function.

photosynthesis related proteins
a large proportion of the proteins whose abundance changed significantly under drought are associated with photosynthesis. in the leaf quantitative proteomic analyses,  <dig> of the identified proteins are involved in photosynthesis: ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase large chain , type i chlorophyll a/b-binding protein b , os05g <dig>  and chloroplast transketolase  . all rubisco detected in this study were up-regulated in response to the drought stress in the drought tolerant wild genotype , but down-regulated/not expressed in the sensitive wild genotype xz <dig> . rubisco, also called fraction-i protein, accounts for up to 30–70/ <dig> g of soluble leaf proteins  and plays a part in photosynthesis. ribulose  <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  catalyzes the initial step of carbon metabolism, the fixation of carbon dioxide, in photosynthetic eukaryotes. rubisco is an extremely slow catalyst and moreover its carboxylation activity is compromised by competing side-reactions, the most notable with another atmospheric gas, o <dig>  which attacks the same enediol intermediate of rubp. the opposing oxygenase activity of rubisco results in the synthesis of phosphoglycolate, a molecule of limited use to most organisms. phosphoglycolate is re-circulated by photorespiration, an energy-requiring salvage pathway. this causes a constant drain on the pool of the sugar substrate  and results in a decrease of the efficiency of carbon fixation by up to  <dig> %. thus, the key to the efficiency of any particular rubisco enzyme should be to enhance it with the ultimate aim to suppress oxygenation and improve carboxylation by rubisco as a means to improve plant height, biomass and yield as the required characteristics of a possible candidate for drought tolerant crop genotype. our previous studies consistent with this results that xz <dig>  recorded higher photosynthesis, biomass and yield than that in xz <dig>  under drought stress  <cit> .

in addition, type i chlorophyll a/b-binding protein b specifically expressed in xz <dig> but not xz <dig> and zau <dig> at  <dig> % soil moisture content . chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins acting as a mobile pool can switch between being light-harvesting antenna for photosystem i or photosystem ii in plants and green algae. this switch, termed state transitions, involves the reversible phosphorylation of the mobile chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins, which is regulated by the redox state of the plastoquinone mediating electron transfer between photosystem i and photosystem ii  <cit> . therefore, the mechanisms underlying the differential expression of this protein in different barley genotypes should be further explored. transketolase is an enzyme of both the pentose phosphate pathway in all organisms and the calvin cycle of photosynthesis in plants  <cit> , chloroplast transketolase was up regulated in xz <dig> while non expression in xz <dig> and zau <dig> under drought stress , indicating that carbon metabolism was also induced under drought stress. os05g <dig>  pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase  is a critical enzyme for c <dig> photosynthesis, providing the primary acceptor for fixation of bicarbonate in mesophyll cells. a key feature of c <dig> photosynthesis is the use of phosphoenolpyruvic acid  as the initial acceptor of bicarbonate, and to allow this the formation of pep is normally catalysed by ppdk  <cit> . ppdk is also present in c <dig> plants. chastain et al  <cit>  reported that c <dig> ppdk in leaves of several angiosperms and in isolated intact spinach chloroplasts undergoes light-/dark-induced changes in phosphorylation state in a manner similar to c <dig> dikinase, and likely represents the ancestral isoform of this unusual and key c <dig> pathway regulatory “converter” enzyme. the ppdk was up regulated in xz <dig> while down regulated in xz <dig> and zau <dig> after five days of recovery, indicating ppdk may play an important role in maintaining higher photosynthesis in xz <dig> in response to recovery.

energy related proteins
atp synthase cf <dig> beta subunit  and atp synthase beta subunit  were expressed at the highest level in drought-tolerant wild genotype xz <dig> over the xz <dig> and zau <dig>  whereas it was down-regulated in xz <dig> under drought stress at  <dig> % or  <dig> % soil moisture content . in plants atp synthase is present in chloroplasts and integrated into thylakoid membrane; the cf1-part sticks into stroma, where dark reactions of photosynthesis and atp synthesis take place. the atp-dependent synthase/protease plays an essential role in controlling the availability of short-lived regulatory proteins and in removing abnormal or damaged proteins. it has been reported that these enzymes play a critical role in the removal of damaged proteins and in the fine control of some key cellular components, combining a peptidase and a chaperone activity  <cit> . therefore drought induced higher expression of atp synthase in xz <dig> could be an attribute for its high drought tolerance. enhanced abundance of atp-synthesis related proteins under stress conditions, such as salinity and drought, has previously been shown by several studies  <cit> , although contrasting findings have also been reported  <cit> . in addition, an increase of the level of such proteins, such as atp synthases, has been implicated to play an indirect role on ion homeostasis under salt stress, where elevated atp levels drive h+-atpases to generate a proton gradient which, in turn, drive na+/h+ antiporters to translocate excessive na+ and cl− ions into the vacuole  <cit> . although the role of ion transporters in drought stress response is not fully understood, their involvement in drought stress is well-established. it was showed that induction of the protein in tolerant barley genotypes may alleviate water-deficit stress by increasing atp supply to meet increased stress-related energy demand  <cit> .

twelve of the identified proteins are involved in stress response: heat-shock protein , glutathione s-transferase  <dig> , putative ascorbate peroxidase , thioredoxin m-type, chloroplast precursor  , putative mono-dehydroascorbate reductase , atp-dependent peptidase/atpase/metallopeptidase  and melanoma-associated antigen p <dig> . these proteins were up-regulated in response to drought stress in the drought tolerant wild genotype xz <dig>  but down-regulated/not expressed in the sensitive wild genotype xz <dig> . heat shock protein /chaperons, the responsibility for protein folding, assembly, translocation and degradation, can not only stabilize proteins and membranes, but also assist refolding process of protein under stress conditions  <cit> . acting as molecular chaperones, hsps are responsible for protecting cells from stress injury, and its major function was characterized as stabilizing protein folding as well as preventing denaturation and aggregation which induced by stress  <cit> . according to the genomic investigations, hsp has a higher expression level at both the mrna and protein level in drought stress tissues  <cit> . the glutathione s-transferases  represents a major group of detoxification enzymes  <cit> , which catalyses the glutathione-dependent detoxification reactions and the reduction of hydroperoxides. in the present study, drought stress induced the increased gst  in xz <dig>  while no expression in sensitive genotype xz <dig>  gst were found to increase during slow drought or rehydration following rapid drought of the drought tolerant moss   <cit> . furthermore, gst may act as binding proteins that sequestrate flavonoids  in the vacuole for protection against environmental stresses  <cit> . the increased level of heat shock protein  and gst  in the tolerant genotype  in the present study indicates their roles in drought stress tolerance in barley.

in addition, plants exposed to drought generate significantly reactive oxygen species , which, on one hand can cause damage to cellular components, and on the other hand, can act as signaling molecules for stress responses  <cit> . plants can also regulate ros level through antioxidant defense enzyme scavenging them such as ascorbate peroxidase , mono-dehydroascorbate reductase  and superoxide dismutase . two of the proteins identified in this study are involved in anti-oxidative system: putative apx  and putative mdhar  . apx and mdhar are two enzymes involved in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, an efficient antioxidant system in the detoxification of ros  <cit> . the cycle maintains a ratio of a reduced per oxidized ascorbic acid  and glutathione  for proper scavenging ros in plant cells  <cit> . secenji  <cit>  found that the transcript level of relative apx gene was obviously changed in two genotypes of wheat when exposed to drought. similarly, cytosolic apx <dig> gene showed a higher expression in both genotypes. however, cytosolic apx <dig> gene was up-regulated only in the drought-tolerant genotype. thylakoid apx gene increased in the drought-tolerant genotype, while stromal apx <dig> gene was found with higher expression levels in the drought-sensitive cultivar  <cit> . the increased or stable activities of apx and mdhar observed in xz <dig> under drought stress could maintain ros detoxification, and under control condition the expression abundance of them were higher in drought tolerant genotype xz <dig> than sensitive xz <dig>  generally, the increased apx and mdhar activities in the leaves of barley under drought stress may help maintain levels of asa and gsh, the two important antioxidants against ros toxicity  <cit> . responses of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle to drought stress and recovery indicate that a co-regulated antioxidant mechanism could develop in barley.

ftsh  is a unique protease that is both membrane bound and atp dependent and acts against integral membrane proteins. it plays pivotal roles in the quality control of membrane proteins by rapidly eliminating abnormal membrane proteins in prokaryotic organisms as well as in the mitochondria and the chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells. in vitro studies have suggested that thylakoid ftsh protease is involved in the degradation of unassembled proteins  <cit> , and in the turnover of the d <dig> protein of the psii reaction center in the context of its repair from photoinhibition  <cit> . it should be noted that a similar role for ftsh has been demonstrated in cyanobacteria. ftsh hexamers are further shown to be heteromeric, containing ‘type a’  and ‘type b’  subunits  <cit> . mutant studies showed that the presence of at least one protein from each type is essential for ftsh hexamers to accumulate and function properly  <cit> . ftsh <dig> was not changed in xz <dig> while down regulated in xz <dig> and zau <dig> after nine day drought stress  and two and five days of recovery, illustrating that ftsh <dig> may have ability to repair damage to the d <dig> polypeptide during stress.

amino-acid biosynthesis and metabolism related proteins
four of the identified protein spots are involved in amino-acid biosynthesis, including adenosylhomocysteinase , elongation factor g  , which were expressed at the highest level in xz <dig> over the xz <dig> and zau <dig>  whereas it was down-regulated in xz <dig> under drought stress  and two days of recovery. elongation factors are a set of proteins that facilitate the translational elongation, the steps in protein synthesis from the formation of the first peptide bond to the formation of the last one  <cit> . the other  <dig> identified protein spots are involved in metabolism: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  <dig> , os02g <dig> putative pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig> alpha subunit , putative ankyrin repeat domain protein  <dig>  . gapdh has been considered to be primarily a housekeeping enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway, catalyzing the nad-dependent conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate into  <dig> -diphosphoglycerate. moreover, expression of gapdh in plants leads to decreased constitutive ros levels and enhanced tolerance to heat shock-induced cell death, which was up regulated in xz <dig> and down regulated in xz <dig> and totally inhibited in zau <dig> after two days of recovery. in plants, pyruvate dehydrogenase complexs  are present in both mitochondria and chloroplasts. both complexes consist of several copies each of at least four enzymes, which together convert pyruvate to acetyl-coa under release of co <dig> and production of nadh  <cit> . whereas the mitochondrial complex mainly provides substrates for the citric acid cycle, the chloroplast homologue produces precursors for fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . the ankyrin repeat  protein family plays a crucial role in plant growth and development and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . most of the ank genes in tomato genome were up-regulated or down-regulated by abiotic stresses such as salt, heat, drought or wounding  <cit> .

during the past decade, large-scale dna sequencing efforts have produced a wealth of information about genomes. an important step in the analysis of gene information is deciphering the complete coding potential or protein coding sequence  region of each gene. using pairs of specific primers, we cloned the length cds region of the two genes, rbcl  and trx-m . comparing the nucleotide sequences, we found that nucleotide sequences performed differently in xz <dig> and xz <dig>  the differences in rbcl and trx-m gene sequences between xz <dig> and xz <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> snps, respectively. there were 2snps resulted in missense mutation bothin the rbcl and trx-m genes. although synonymous mutations cannot affect coding amino acid sequence, it induces the enhancement of exon splicing. thus translation rate and the half-life of mrna molecules will be affected, in this way influencing protein expression levels, and even altering the spatial structure of protein. if the structure of a particular protein changed, its normal function may be lost. we speculate that the snps up-regulated the protein expression of xz <dig>  and down-regulated in xz <dig>  in addition, in arabidopsis, at least four trx isoforms  have been found in the chloroplast  <cit> . mohammed and madhur  <cit>  suggested that ostrx <dig> may participate in regulating the enzyme activities in photosynthesis  and metabolism  in oryza sativa. similar results have also been found in pea chloroplast and roots . plants frequently encounter external stresses conditions that adversely affect growth and development. abiotic stresses trigger a wide range of plant responses, from alteration of gene expression and cellular metabolism to changes in plant growth rates and crop yields. a high expression indicated that the genes may play an important protective role against stressful hormone and light/dark conditions. in contrast, a low expression of the important genes in response to abiotic/hormone treatments, although possibly functioning as a survival strategy, may make the plants more vulnerable to those treatment conditions  <cit> . our findings showed that trx-m  was up-regulated in response to drought stress in the drought tolerant wild genotype xz <dig>  but down-regulated/not expressed in the sensitive wild genotype xz <dig> , indicating that trx-m gene may play an important protective role against drought stress in the drought tolerant wild genotype xz <dig>  further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying molecular and metabolic pathways to better understand the mechanisms involved in drought-tolerance of wild barley and provide new molecular resources to develop more drought-tolerant crops.

CONCLUSIONS
it is the first study to identify drought-responsive proteins in tibetan wild barley  using a proteomic approach. because tibetan wild barley xz <dig> and xz <dig> are the two contrasting genotypes with different drought tolerances, the drought-regulated proteins identified using comparative proteomics will provide a good foundation to elucidate the mechanisms involved in drought-tolerance in tibetan wild barley. here we found that barley plants respond to drought stress by changing the expression pattern of several proteins involved in photosynthesis, stress response, amino acid synthesis, energy and metabolism. the drought tolerance-associated proteins may be key factors that regulate these pathways. it is important to note that  <dig> of the  <dig> identified drought tolerance-associated proteins, up-regulated in xz <dig> and simultaneously down-regulated/unaltered in xz <dig>  may be specific proteins with important roles in drought tolerance/resistance in xz <dig>  among them,  <dig> protein spots , were markedly induced by drought in xz <dig> but not expressed in xz <dig> and zau <dig> by drought stress. this difference suggests that these specific proteins may play a crucial role in tolerance to drought stress in xz <dig>  our findings highlight the significance of drought-tolerance-associated-specific-proteins, and provide an insight into proteomic basis for drought-tolerance in tibetan wild barley which offers novel molecular resource for drought-tolerance. in addition, it is noteworthy that functions of some of these differentially expressed proteins and their direct involvement in stress tolerance are poorly understood.
