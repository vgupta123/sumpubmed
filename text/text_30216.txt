BACKGROUND
approximately  <dig> million people are infected worldwide by hepatitis c virus   <cit> . almost 80% of infected patients develop a chronic hepatitis that can in the long term evolve either to liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. unfortunately, no vaccine is currently available to prevent new infections and the current treatments are not fully efficient  <cit> . hcv is an enveloped rna virus mainly targeting liver cells by a mechanism that has yet to be elucidated. for a long time, it has been difficult to study the different steps of the hcv life cycle because of the difficulties in propagating this virus in cell culture. however, a major step in investigating hcv entry was achieved in the development of pseudotyped particles , consisting of native hcv envelope glycoproteins, e <dig> and e <dig>  assembled onto retroviral core particles  <cit> . more recently, the development of a cell culture system allowing an efficient amplification of hcv  has also been reported  <cit> . this cell culture system allows the study of the whole life cycle of hcv and, together with hcvpp, also permits the characterization of hcv entry mechanisms.

although the early steps of viral entry have yet to be elucidated, accumulated data suggest several cell surface-expressed molecules as entry factors for hcv . among these molecules, the tetraspanin cd <dig> has been shown to play a key role in hcv entry, acting during a post-attachment step  <cit> . like all members of the tetraspanin family, cd <dig> is composed of four transmembrane domains, a small extracellular loop  and a large extracellular loop , which contains a conserved ccg amino acid motif involved in the formation of disulfide bridges  <cit> . the cd <dig> lel is the critical region for the interaction with the e <dig> envelope glycoprotein and for virus entry. the role of cd <dig> in the species restriction of hcv has been extensively studied  <cit> , and it has been recently shown that in spite of the absence of in vitro interaction between murine cd <dig>  lel and a soluble form of hcv e <dig>  the ectopic expression of mcd <dig> in hepg <dig> cells restored permissivity to hcvpp and, in a lesser extent, to hcvcc  <cit> . these results suggest that cd <dig> contributes to, but alone does not define, the species restriction and additional cellular factors are likely involved. moreover, we have recently shown that ewi-2wint, a new partner of cd <dig>  is able to modulate hcv entry in target cells suggesting that, in addition to the presence of specific entry factors in the hepatocytes, the absence of a specific inhibitor may contribute to the hepatotropism of hcv  <cit> .

members of the tetraspanin family organize and regroup their associated transmembrane proteins and are involved in various functions such as cell morphology, motility, fusion and signalling  <cit> . a major characteristic of tetraspanins is their ability to interact with each other and with other transmembrane proteins, thus building multi-molecular membrane complexes, collectively referred to as the tetraspanin enriched microdomains  or tetraspanin webs  <cit> . membrane cholesterol contributes to the organization of these domains on the surface of live cells  <cit> . cholesterol is also critical to many pathogens, including hcv  <cit>  and plasmodium infection  <cit> . interestingly, it has been shown that cd <dig> is required for plasmodium sporozoite entry and differentiation into hepatocytes  <cit> . using a monoclonal antibody  that specifically recognizes a subset of mouse cd <dig> molecules associated with tems , silvie et al. have defined the role of tem-associated cd <dig> in mice plasmodium infection  <cit> . the similarities between plasmodium and hcv liver infections indicate the importance of studying the role of tem-associated cd <dig> in hcv infection.

in our study, infection of huh- <dig> target cells with highly infectious hcvcc particles allowed us to isolate a cellular clone resistant to hcv infection which has lost cd <dig> expression . we then took advantage of the emergence of these cd81-deficient cells to analyze the functionality of mcd <dig> in hcv infection and to study the role of tem-associated cd <dig> in hcv infection.

RESULTS
generation of huh- <dig> cells resistant to hcv infection
in a previous study, we have shown that a hcv jfh- <dig> full-length rna genome encoding mutations in the capsid and e <dig> sequences  releases highly infectious hcvcc particles which display a marked cytopathic effect on target cells  <cit> . infection of huh- <dig> cells with these particles led to the selection of few living cells that were resistant to hcv infection. in order to analyze the capacity of these cells to resist to hcvcc infection, they were amplified and treated with interferon Î± to eliminate any potential remaining virus. this cell population, called resistant  <dig> , displayed reduced levels of jfh- <dig> hcvcc infection compared to parental huh- <dig> cells . in parallel, we infected the r <dig> cell population with retroviral particles harboring hcv envelope glycoproteins of genotypes 1a or 2a  and found reduced levels of hcvpp infection in comparison to huh- <dig> cells . both cell lines were not infected by particles devoid of envelope proteins  and were equally infected with the positive control vsvpp, which infects virtually all type of cells .

to further analyze this cellular resistance to hcv infection, cellular clones were isolated by limiting dilution and their sensitivity to hcvcc and hcvpp infection was analyzed. as shown in figure 1c, several clones were resistant to infection  while others exhibited some susceptibility to hcvcc , but greatly reduced when compared to the parental huh- <dig> cells. interestingly, analysis of the sensitivity of several clones to hcvpp infection showed similar reduced infectivity levels , indicating that the entry step of hcv life cycle is affected in these cells. the only major difference was observed for clone  <dig>  which was barely permissive for jfh- <dig> infection but highly permissive for hcvpp, suggesting that replication or assembly of hcvcc is likely affected in these cells.

ectopic expression of human and mouse cd <dig> in resistant cells restores hcv permissivity
the hcv entry stage is a multistep process involving several cellular factors . among these molecules, the tetraspanin cd <dig>  the scavenger receptor class b type i , and the tight junction protein claudin  <dig>  play key roles. since the absence of one of these molecules might explain the differences in infectivity of the r <dig> cell clones, their expression levels were examined . experiments of surface biotinylation followed by immunoprecipitations with specific mabs showed that the cell surface expression levels of sr-bi and cldn- <dig> were similar in each clone, whereas cd <dig> expression differed among the clones. cd <dig> cellular expression levels in r <dig> cell clones were also tested by anti-cd <dig> western-blotting over total cell lysates and similar results were obtained . interestingly, non permissive r <dig> cell clones were also negative for cd <dig> expression, indicating that hcv entry defect observed in clones  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is likely due to the absence of cd <dig> expression.

to confirm our hypothesis, we ectopically expressed cd <dig> in one of the non-permissive huh- <dig> r <dig> cell clones  that we called huh-7w <dig> cells. plasmids expressing human cd <dig> , mouse cd <dig>  or empty expression vector  were stably transfected in huh-7w <dig> cells. the cd <dig> expression level was next controlled by flow cytometry analysis using  <dig> . <dig>  anti-hcd <dig>  and mt <dig> anti-mcd <dig>  mabs. cell surface expression of hcd <dig> in huh-7w7/hcd <dig> cells was higher than in parental huh- <dig> cells, whereas no hcd <dig> expression was detectable in huh-7w7/pcdna <dig>  and huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells. mcd <dig> was also highly expressed in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells  and expression level was comparable with the one of hepa <dig>  cells that naturally express mouse cd <dig> . huh- <dig> cells and the complemented huh-7w <dig> populations displayed similar expression levels of the control tetraspanin cd <dig> .

we next tested the sensitivity of the different cell lines to hcvcc and hcvpp infection. control cells expressing the empty vector pcdna <dig>  were totally resistant to hcv infection . in contrast, huh-7w7/hcd <dig> cells were equally or slightly more infected by hcvpp than parental huh- <dig> cells . thus, ectopic expression of hcd <dig> fully restores permissivity to hcvpp harboring hcv envelope glycoproteins from different genotypes indicating that cd <dig> expression is likely the only defect for hcv entry in huh-7w <dig> cells. however, the level of infectivity of huh-7w7/hcd <dig> cells by hcvcc was 50%, as compared to the one of huh- <dig> cells, indicating that despite being highly expressed, hcd <dig> did not fully restore permissivity to hcvcc. overexpression of cd <dig>  in huh-7w7/hcd <dig> cells may lead cd <dig> to oligomerize, as shown for cd <dig> another tetraspanin  <cit> , in less permissive cd <dig> molecules to hcvcc infection. the entry efficiency of hcvpp will not be affected in this context but only driven by cd <dig> expression levels. it has to be noted that differences in hcvcc and hcvpp entries have already been shown  <cit> .

interestingly, ectopic expression of mcd <dig> in huh-7w <dig> cells was also able to restore hcv permissivity. as shown in figure 1g, the level of permissivity to hcvcc of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells was 20% of the one of parental huh- <dig> cells. in addition, permissivity of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells to hcvpp bearing glycoproteins from different genotypes was analyzed and showed that mcd <dig> supports infection with hcvpp from genotypes 2a and  <dig>  with 29% and 19% of level of infectivity respectively, as compared to the one of huh- <dig> cells . in contrast to flint et al.  <cit> , we did not observe any significant infectivity for hcvpp harboring glycoproteins from genotypes 1a and 1b.

it is worth noting that the sensitivity of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells to hcv infection is solely due to the expression of mcd <dig> since anti-hcd <dig> mabs  efficiently inhibited hcvcc and hcvpp infection of huh- <dig> and huh-7w7/hcd <dig> cells, but did not significantly affect the infectivity of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells. these results indicate that no residual expression of hcd <dig> is responsible for permissivity since in such a case infection would be fully inhibited by the anti-hcd <dig> mabs. control experiment performed with irrelevant antibodies did not inhibit hcv infectivity .

taken together, these data indicate that hcv infection is directly related to cd <dig> expression in huh-7w <dig> cells. most importantly, mcd <dig> in the context of such human hepatocytes is able to some extent to mimic the role of hcd <dig> in hcv entry and likely interacts in a similar way with cellular factors.

role of tem-associated cd <dig> in hcv entry
tetraspanins associate extensively with each other and other membrane proteins to form the tems. recently, silvie et al. have described the mt81w mab, which specifically recognizes mouse cd <dig> associated with other tetraspanins. this is evidenced by the lack of recognition of cd <dig> after cell lysis with detergents that do not preserve tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions, and by the complete removal of the cd <dig> pool recognized by mt81w following immunodepletion of tetraspanin complexes  <cit> . cd <dig> is required for invasion of hepatocytes by sporozoites of human malaria plasmodium falciparum and rodent malaria plasmodium yoelii parasites  <cit> . using mt81w antibody, silvie et al. have shown that the subset of cd <dig> associated with tems contributes to plasmodium sporozoite infection  <cit> . such an antibody preferentially recognizing human cd <dig> associated with tems is not available. however, since huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells are susceptible to hcvcc and hcvpp-2a infection, we next took advantage of this model and the mt81w mab to study the role of tem-associated cd <dig> in the early steps of hcv life cycle.

using the mt81w anti-mcd <dig> mab, we first characterized the subpopulation of mcd <dig> that is associated with tems on the cell surface of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells . as shown by flow cytometry analysis, the intensity of mt81w labeling only reached  <dig> Â± 14%, depending on the experiment, of the intensity with mt <dig> in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells, indicating that only a fraction of cd <dig> molecules is engaged in tetraspanin microdomains on these cells, as described for hepa1â <dig> cells  <cit> . however, we cannot exclude that the lower affinity of mt81w may lead to an underestimate of the ratio of cd <dig> engaged in tems. the specificity of mt81w to recognize tem-associated cd <dig> in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments from biotinylated cell lysates made under different detergent conditions. tetraspanin microdomains are typically disrupted by triton x- <dig>  but are retained in less hydrophobic detergents such as brij  <dig>  <cit> . as shown in figure 3b, 5a <dig> and mt <dig> mabs precipitated hcd <dig> and mcd <dig>  respectively, under both detergent condition. in contrast, mt81w was able to precipitate mcd <dig> only from brij <dig> lysates preserving tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions, but not from triton x- <dig> lysates. these results show that expression of mcd <dig> in huh-7w <dig> cells allowed to reconstitute tetraspanin webs that are specifically recognized by the well characterized mt81w mab  <cit> .

to ensure that similar molecular web interactions occur in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> and huh- <dig> cells, we next analyzed tem composition in immunoprecipitation experiments of surface biotinylated cell lysates. since lysis in brij  <dig> preserves tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions, any anti-tetraspanin mab can co-immunoprecipitate the entire set of proteins present in tetraspanin microdomains  <cit> . the tetraspanin pattern obtained with huh- <dig> cells using 5a <dig> hcd <dig> mab is shown in figure 3c. the major proteins co-immunoprecipitated with cd <dig> have an apparent molecular mass consistent with that of ewi- <dig> and ewi-f, two major partners of cd <dig>  <cit> . the identity of these proteins was confirmed by direct immunoprecipitation , as previously described  <cit> . interestingly, mt <dig> and mt81w immunoprecipitations of mcd <dig> in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells gave a pattern similar to that of hcd <dig> in huh- <dig> cells . ewi- <dig> and ewi-f proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with mcd <dig> in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells. in addition, immunoprecipitation with an anti-cd <dig>  another tetraspanin, co-immunoprecipitated a fraction of mcd <dig> in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells as well as hcd <dig> in huh- <dig> cells . altogether, in spite of slight differences in stoichiometry, these results show that mcd <dig> in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells is engaged in similar web interactions than hcd <dig> in huh- <dig> cells.

we then analyzed the ability of mt <dig> and mt81w to inhibit hcvcc and hcvpp infectivity. as shown in figures 4a and 4b, mt <dig> mab, which recognizes the whole population of cd <dig>  efficiently inhibited both hcvcc infection and hcvpp entry into huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells. indeed, mt <dig> inhibited 80% of hcvcc infection and 95% of hcvpp infection at low concentrations . in contrast, mt81w was poorly neutralizing since it only induced an inhibition of 40% and 60% of hcvcc and hcvpp infection, respectively, at tenfold higher concentrations . however, it has to be noted that mt81w mab might be a low-affinity antibody, as compared to mt <dig>  <cit> . the specificity of the observed inhibitory effect was ensured by using an irrelevant antibody at the highest concentration . as expected, mt <dig> and mt81w did not affect hcvcc or hcvpp infectivity levels of huh- <dig> cells .

together, our results suggest that tem-associated cd <dig> molecules might not play a central role in hcv entry. however, since we cannot exclude a partial recognition of tem-associated cd <dig> molecules by the low affinity mt81w mab or that the epitope recognized by this antibody is located outside of the e <dig> binding region, we further analyzed the role of tem-associated cd <dig> in hcv entry using other approaches.

role of cholesterol in hcv infection and the association of cd <dig> with tem
cellular cholesterol has been shown to modulate the organization of tetraspanin microdomains  <cit>  and to be involved in hcv life cycle  <cit> . to further analyze the role of tem-associated cd <dig> in hcv infection, we next assessed the effect of cholesterol depletion on hcv infection. huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells were treated with increasing amounts of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin , a cyclic oligosaccharide that selectively removes cholesterol from the plasma membrane without incorporating into the membrane  <cit> . treatment of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells with mÎ²cd prior to infection resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of hcvcc  and hcvpp-2a  infectivity. in both set of experiments the maximal inhibition of hcv infection was reached at an mÎ²cd concentration of  <dig> mm, which decreased the cellular cholesterol content by fivefold . moreover, inhibition of infection was specifically due to cholesterol removal from the cell surface, since it was reversed by cholesterol replenishment with mÎ²cd-cholesterol complexes before hcv infection . such preformed mÎ²cd-cholesterol complexes are known to replenish cells with cholesterol  <cit> . it has to be noted that mÎ²cd treatment had no effect on vsvpp entry , which is clathrin dependent, indicating that hcvpp entry inhibition was not due to disruption of clathrin-enriched domains following cholesterol depletion  <cit> . in addition, cell treatment with mÎ²cd at  <dig> mm three hours after cell/virus contact did not have any effect on infection , indicating that membrane cholesterol is required at the entry step and mÎ²cd is not toxic under our experimental conditions. cholesterol depletion and replenishment experiments were performed on huh- <dig> cells and gave similar results .

altogether, our data confirm the role of cholesterol in hcv entry and bring to light a similar response of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> and huh- <dig> cells to cholesterol depletion and replenishment in terms of hcv infection.

we next analyzed by flow cytometry the surface expression of cd <dig> and its association with tems in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells treated with mÎ²cd or mÎ²cd-cholesterol complexes , and expression of cd <dig> was used as a control . mÎ²cd treatment of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells reduced mt <dig> labelling by  <dig> Â± 7% , suggesting that cholesterol depletion induced a decrease in total cell surface expression of mcd <dig> in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells. even with cholesterol replenishment, cd <dig> expression level could not be restored to conditions that would enable hcv infectivity . incubation of mÎ²cd-treated cells with increasing concentrations of preformed mÎ²cd-cholesterol complexes raised cell surface mcd <dig> expression level . however, a concentration four times higher than needed to reverse the inhibitory effect of mÎ²cd on hcv infectivity  was necessary to reach the cell surface mcd <dig> expression level of untreated cells. interestingly, treatment with mÎ²cd alone had no effect on tem-associated mcd <dig> population in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells, as determined using mt81w . conversely, cholesterol enrichment of non depleted cells with preformed mÎ²cd-cholesterol complexes led to a  <dig> Â±  <dig>  fold increase of tem-associated mcd <dig> population , without any change in the total cd <dig> population . these results confirm the role of cholesterol in tem organization. expression of cd <dig> under different conditions was not affected .

our results differ from those of silvie et al. showing that similar mÎ²cd treatment of hepa1â <dig> cells did not lead to a significant decrease of total cd <dig> cell surface expression  <cit> . however, it has to be noted that the tetraspanin cd <dig>  expressed in hepa1â <dig> cells but not in huh- <dig> cells, has been shown to increase stability of tetraspanin complexes  <cit> .

in conclusion, cellular cholesterol depletion mediated by mÎ²cd strongly affects hcv infection, but it has no effect on tem-associated mcd <dig> in huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells. again, these data do not support a key role for tem-associated cd <dig> molecules in hcv infection.

finally, we ensured that mÎ²cd-induced inhibition of hcv entry did not lead to a reduced expression level of another hcv entry factor. we analyzed the expression levels of sr-bi, cldn- <dig> and ldl receptor , three other major actors of hcv entry  <cit> . the tetraspanin cd <dig> was used again as a control. since no antibody against extracellular loops of cldn- <dig> is available for flow cytometry, we performed our analyses by immunoprecipitation of surface biotinylated cell lysates. as shown above, treatment of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells with mÎ²cd was accompanied by a reduced expression level of cd <dig>  as detected by mt <dig> . we also found a reduced immunoprecipitation of cd <dig> by mt81w after mÎ²cd treatment. cholesterol depletion prior to lysis in brij  <dig> likely led to a harsher effect of the detergent leading to a partial dissociation of tetraspanin complexes recognized by mt81w. interestingly, treatment of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells with mÎ²cd did not lead to a reduction of cell surface expression of sr-bi, cldn- <dig> or ldl-r. it has to be noted that sr-bi and cldn- <dig> seemed even more expressed after mÎ²cd treatment . this increased expression of sr-bi after mÎ²cd treatment was confirmed by flow cytometry  and has been previously described by others  <cit> . it has also been suggested that cldn- <dig> might be in membrane domains resistant to mÎ²cd treatment  <cit> . altogether, our results show that mÎ²cd-induced inhibition of hcv entry was solely due to reduced levels of cholesterol and cd <dig> 

role of ceramide in tem-associated cd <dig> and in hcv infection
beyond cholesterol, sphingolipids are also known to be important for the organization of the plasma membrane. among them, sphingomyelin can be converted into ceramide by sphingomyelinase , and increasing ceramide concentration can lead to lipid microdomain reorganization  <cit> . we have previously reported that ceramide enrichment of the plasma membrane of huh- <dig> cells following sphingomyelin hydrolysis by sphingomyelinase strongly inhibits hcv entry and reduces cd <dig> cell surface expression level by 50%  <cit> . since sphingomyelin influences cd <dig> cell surface expression as well as hcv infection, we sought to determine the effect of the smase treatment on tem-associated cd <dig> population. huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells were pre-treated with smase, washed and then infected with hcvcc or hcvpp-2a. similarly to huh- <dig> cells, huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells were affected by smase treatment, resulting in 70â80% and 50â60% inhibition of hcvcc and hcvpp-2a infection, respectively .

in order to determine whether these inhibitions were associated with changes in cell surface expression of cd <dig>  we analyzed by flow cytometry the cd <dig> surface expression level after smase treatment . interestingly, smase treatment of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells led to a significant reduction  in mt <dig> labelling and conversely to significant increase  in mt81w labelling, indicating that the treatment induced a reduction of total mcd <dig> expression and an increased association of cd <dig> with tem. as expected, smase treatment did not affect the expression of the control tetraspanin cd <dig> .

we next ensured that smase-induced inhibition of hcv entry was not also associated with reduced expression level of another hcv entry factor. as described above, we analyzed the expression levels of sr-bi, cldn- <dig> and ldl-r after treatment of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells with smase. as shown above , treatment with smase was accompanied by a reduced expression level of cd <dig>  as detected by mt <dig> . in accordance with our previous results , we also found an increased immunoprecipitation of cd <dig> by mt81w after smase treatment. interestingly, expression level of sr-bi, cldn- <dig> or ldl-r were not affected following treatment of cells with smase .

thus, smase treatment of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells resulted in hcv entry inhibition and increase of tem-associated mcd <dig> population. in agreement with previous data, these results indicate that tem-associated cd <dig> does not play a major role in hcv entry. smase treatment resulted also in a significant decrease of cell surface expression of cd <dig> on huh- <dig> cells , as described previously  <cit> . the similarity of huh- <dig> and huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells responses to smase treatment tends to show that results obtained with huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells can be extrapolated to huh- <dig> cells.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have previously shown that mutations  in the structural proteins of the jfh- <dig> genome increase the production and infectivity of hcvcc particles, leading to an accelerated cytopathic effect  <cit> . interestingly, infection of huh- <dig> cells with such particles led us to isolate cellular clones exhibiting different levels of permissivity to hcvcc and hcvpp. for most of them, reduced hcv infection levels were directly related to their reduced expression level of cd <dig>  while other entry molecules such as sr-bi and cldn- <dig> were not modified. our observation is in accordance with previously published data  <cit> . ectopic expression of cd <dig> in huh-7w <dig> cells, one of the resistant cell clones, restored hcv permissivity indicating that cd <dig> deficiency alone was responsible for the resistance to hcv infection in these cells. in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , we did not observe any variation in hcv genome replication in huh-7w <dig> cells in comparison to huh- <dig> cells , suggesting that cd <dig> is not involved in this step of the viral cycle. masciopinto et al. showed that cd <dig> and hcv envelope glycoproteins could be detected in exosomes of mammalian cells, suggesting that hcv may intracellularly interact with cd <dig> allowing its export  <cit> . they pointed out a possible role of cd <dig> in assembly and release of hcv particles. however, our results indicate that cd <dig> does not participate to hcv assembly or release of new viral particles, since the supernatant of huh-7w <dig> cells transfected with full-length hcv rna infected naÃ¯ve huh- <dig> cells to a level comparable to that of the supernatant from transfected huh- <dig> cells. thus, huh-7w <dig> cells constitute a new tool allowing to investigate the involvement of cd <dig> in hcv entry and offering a new single-cycle replication system, as already used by others  <cit> .

the molecular determinants of hcv-cd <dig> interaction have been analyzed by several groups by using biochemical assays . however, flint et al have highlighted the limitation of these approaches since various mutated cd <dig> sequences previously reported to abrogate e2-cd <dig> interaction, were able to restore permissivity in hepg <dig> cells  <cit> . in our study, we show that ectopic expression of human and mouse cd <dig> proteins in human hepatoma cells devoid of cd <dig> conferred susceptibility to infection by hcvcc and hcvpp at various levels. interestingly, mcd <dig> protein supports infection by hcvcc and hcvpp bearing glycoproteins from genotypes 2a and  <dig> suggesting that, in accordance with other studies  <cit> , cd <dig> is not the sole determinant of species susceptibility to hcv. other additional cellular factors likely modulate hcv entry. in addition, interaction/organization levels and stoichiometry between entry factors and plasma membrane lipids may regulate species susceptibility to hcv.

cd <dig> belongs to the tetraspanin family of which members have the distinctive feature of clustering dynamically with numerous partner proteins and with one another in membrane microdomains. within this web, the associations of tetraspanins with their nontetraspanin partner molecules have been referred to as primary, and tetraspanin can interact with each other through their associated partner  <cit> . in contrast to primary complexes, tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions are not stoichiometric and palmitoylation is necessary for the maintenance of these interactions  <cit> . it is still unknown whether all tetraspanins expressed in a certain cell are associated with each other. importantly, tetraspanins associate indirectly with additional proteins. functionally, these interactions cluster in tem, enabling lateral dynamic organization in the membrane and the cross-talk with intracellular signalling and cytoskeletal structures  <cit> . in our study, generation of a human cell line expressing mcd <dig>  permissive to hcv infection allowed us to analyze the role of tem-associated cd <dig> in hcv infection. this study could be performed with two recently described mabs: mt <dig>  which recognizes total mcd81; and mt81w, which specifically recognizes a fraction of mcd <dig> associated with other tetraspanins  <cit> . it is worth noting that such a tool allowing the detection of hcd <dig> associated with tems is not available. we first determined the inhibitory effect of both mabs on hcvcc and hcvpp infection: mt <dig> strongly inhibited hcv infection, whereas mt81w led to a weak inhibition of infection at saturing concentrations. this reduced capacity of mt81w mab to inhibit hcv infection suggests that tem-associated cd <dig> molecules, recognized by this mab, are not the exclusive site of infection. in accordance with these results, ceramide enrichment of plasma membrane leading to an increased association of cd <dig> with tems highly inhibits hcv infection. while palmitoylation is not the only mechanism by which tetraspanins interact with each other, it has been shown to play an essential role in tem organization  <cit> . the ability of palmitoylation-defective cd <dig> to support infection by hcvpp  <cit>  is again consistent with a minor role of tem-associated cd <dig> in hcv entry. we cannot exclude that the epitope recognized by mt81w mab on cd <dig> is not involved in hcv interaction. the partial inhibition of mt81w might also be the reflect of a partial recognition of the tem-associated cd <dig> fraction, as previously suggested by silvie et al.  <cit> .

the entire hcv life cycle is associated with cholesterol metabolism in host cells , and lipid composition of the plasma membrane seems very important for the hcv entry step. in our study, we showed that cholesterol depletion by treatment with mÎ²cd strongly reduced hcv entry into target cells, and conversely cholesterol replenishment by mÎ²cd-cholesterol complexes restored the infection levels. these results point out again the importance of cell membrane cholesterol in hcv entry, likely in the fusion process as has been previously suggested  <cit> . very recently, we have shown that increasing the levels of ceramide in the plasma membrane induce a massive endocytosis of cd <dig> leading to a strong inhibition of hcv infection  <cit> . interestingly, in the present study, we showed that following smase treatment of huh-7w7/mcd <dig> cells, expression of cd <dig> is inversely related to association of cd <dig> with tetraspanin webs. these results suggest that ceramide might specifically modify the levels of interaction or the cell surface distribution of tem. in this regard, it has been shown that gangliosides play an important role in the organization of cd82-enriched microdomains  <cit> . ceramide enrichment may also induce clustering of cd <dig> leading to an increased binding of mt81w mab. in accordance with this hypothesis, it has been shown that high levels of ceramide induce large-scale clustering/capping of death receptors  required to initiate efficient formation of death-induced signalling complex  <cit> . alternatively, mt81w may recognize an epitope of cd <dig> that is more exposed following ceramide enrichment. further analyses are necessary to evaluate these hypotheses.

hcv and plasmodium are two major pathogens targeting the liver. both use the glycosaminoglycans for their initial attachment on the surface of hepatocytes  <cit> , and lipidic transfer properties of scavenger receptor class b type i regulate infection of both pathogens  <cit> . cd <dig> is required for hcv and plasmodium life cycle. antibodies to cd <dig> or cd <dig> silencing strongly reduce the infection of hepatic cells and cd81-deficient mouse hepatocytes are resistant to infection by plasmodium  <cit> . using cd81/cd <dig> chimeras, it has been recently shown that cd <dig> lel plays a critical role in sporozoite infection and a stretch of  <dig> amino acids is sufficient to confer susceptibility to infection  <cit> . in contrast to hcv infection, it seems that cd <dig> does not act directly as a receptor but is rather involved indirectly, likely by modulating the activity of an associated protein. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that cd <dig> associated to multiple proteins in the tetraspanin web plays a major role in sporozoite infection, since modulation of cellular cholesterol levels, which changes tetraspanin microdomain organization, has been shown to also modify the extent of cd81-dependent sporozoite infection  <cit> . in contrast, in our study, we demonstrated that tem-associated cd <dig> is not used by hcv, indicating that these two pathogens, while using the same molecules, invade their host by different mechanisms.
