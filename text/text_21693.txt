BACKGROUND
defect in angiogenesis or blood vessel repair is the major cause of complications of cardiovascular disorder  and many ischemia-related diseases, such as diabetes and stroke  <cit> . post-natal angiogenesis and vasculogenesis relies, at least partly, on circulating endothelial progenitor cells , which may be derived from bone marrow stem cells . the regulation of vessel repair depends not only on the number of circulating epcs but also on the activity of these epcs  <cit> . there is a paucity of data examining the epc status, especially in terms of their functionality, in subjects with metabolic syndrome without diabetes or cardiovascular disease  <cit> . epc activities also affect the efficacy of epc-based transplantation therapy, specifically if only a low number of engraftment migrate to the injured site after infusion, which will limit the clinical applications of epcs.

currently epcs are defined into two distinct populations based on phenotype and biological properties: early epcs  appear early  in culture dishes, whereas late epcs appear late in culture  and have a cobblestone-like morphology  <cit> . as a result, yoder’s group denominates late and early epc as ecfc  and cac , respectively  <cit> . the distinct angiogenic properties of these two epc subpopulations have been explored using angiogenesis assays: both late epc and matured endothelial cell , but not early epc, form capillary microvasculate structures at a similar efficiency  <cit> . however, early epc expresses abundant inflammatory cytokines and paracrine angiogenic factors to promote angiogenesis in a paracrine manner  <cit> . the detailed mrna expression profiles and functional module analysis for different epcs have been deciphered  <cit> . however, detail microrna  expression patterns of early and epcs are awaited to be explored.

mirnas are small rnas of 18– <dig> nucleotides in length that have emerged as master regulators of angiogenesis  <cit> . these single-strand small rnas act by silencing gene expression through imperfect base pairing with cognate transcripts, and one mirna is able to target multiple different mrnas since rna silencing by mirna does not require perfect sequence complementarity  <cit> . in the human genome, more than  <dig> mirnas have been discovered . tissue mirnas, as well as circulating mirnas in body fluids, have recently been considered as a potential approach to identifying new disease biomarkers, and novel drug targets . many pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic mirnas have been pinpointed. examples like mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are transcribed from the same mirna cluster and are able to modulate the angiogenic properties of huvecs by targeting c-kit and endothelial nitric oxide synthase   <cit> . furthermore, levels of epc mir-221/ <dig> are significantly higher in patients with coronary artery disease   <cit> . conversely, mir-31-5p is a pro-angiogenic mirna that induces epc migration/invasion by targeting fat <dig>  <cit> . mir-10b and mir-196b, which are key regulators of hox signaling and adult stem cell differentiation, have also been identified as upregulated mirnas in circulating tumor epcs and are responsive to vascular endothelial growth factor  stimulation  <cit> . these findings indicate that targeting mirnas may constitute a novel strategy for manipulating epc activities for therapeutic purposes.

up to the present, thousands of mirnas have been identified in animals and plants, and many more mirnas are continuously being identified by newly available technologies including small rna sequencing . high-throughput sequencing is not only able to reveal the expression profiles of known mirnas, but also is able to discover new mirnas that have not been recorded previously in any databases, in particular the mirbase repository. small rna sequencing has been used to carry out research on various types of stem cells, including embryonic stem cells , hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> , and neural precursor cells  <cit> . novel mirnas have also been identified using smrna-seq during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells  <cit>  and during endothelial differentiation  <cit> .

the main goal of this study is to find mirnas controlling epc features, hypothesizing that specific mirnas must be present in cells that have different biological activities. we applied smrna-seq analyses to endothelial lineage cells for identifying mirnas that might regulate the activation of the angiogenesis-related phenotypes of epcs. novel mirna-target genes were further identified by tandem array analysis.

methods
isolation and cultivation of epcs
cord blood epc isolation and characterization were done as described  <cit> . all patients gave informed consent, and the study was approved by the mackay memorial hospital research ethics committee. the protocols of this study are consistent with the ethical guidelines of the  <dig> helsinki declaration. in brief, cord blood samples were obtained from healthy donors, and total mononuclear cells  were isolated by density gradient centrifugation with histopaque- <dig> . mncs  were plated in 2 ml endothelial growth medium  with supplements on fibronectin-coated 6-well plates. after 4 days of culturing, the medium was changed and non-adherent cells were removed, and attached early epcs appeared to be elongated with spindle shapes. late epcs  emerged 2– <dig> weeks after the start of the mnc culture. for epc derived from peripheral blood of healthy donors, we collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from 10 ml whole blood for each individual and followed the same cultivation protocol as cord blood epc. late epcs could be observed 2– <dig> weeks after the start of pbmc culture and the successful rate of late epc colony formation was about 50%. the successful rate of late epc colony formation from peripheral blood of cad patients was about 10%.

cloning and transient expression of mir-221/ <dig> expression constructs were described  <cit> . cell migration ability was evaluated using costar transwell polycarbonate permeable supports  as previously described  <cit> .

rna isolation and quantitative rt-pcr
total rna were extracted by the trizol® solution . 100 ng to 1 μg of total rna were subjected into reverse transcription using a first cdna synthesis kit . for quantitative real-time pcr analysis, human pre-messenger rna sequence was obtained from the ncbi  aceview program . all primers were designed to cross introns using the primer <dig> website  or primer express software . primers for mirna qpcr were designed on the basis of stem-loop rt-qpcr for mirna quantification  <cit> . thermodynamics and primer specificity analysis were performed by the vector nti suite  and the ncbi reverse e-pcr program . real-time pcr reactions were performed using maxima™ sybr green qpcr master mix , and the specific products of the pcrs were detected and analyzed using a stepone™ sequence detector . the expression level of each gene or mirna was normalized against the expression level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  or u <dig> snorna. all the primer sequences are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> online.

small rna sequencing  and mirna data analysis
small rna sequencing  was done on the illumina genome analyzer iix platform  according to the manufacturer’s instruction. in-house bioinformatics pipelines were constructed for profiling and predicting novel mirnas from sequencing data  <cit> . these were firstly the mirnovel pipeline, which was adapted from the mirdeep <dig> and mireap algorithms, and was constructed to predicting and profile novel mirnas  <cit> . in this pipeline, fastq sequences, which were without poly-a tracts, ambiguous nucleotides or a 5′ adapter, but contained the flanking 6–18 nt of the 3′ adapter sequence, had the adapter sequence trimmed and the identical sequences were then collapse to a series of unique sequences. next, any resulting unique sequences that did not align with the sequences of known mrnas  or known mirnas  were aligned to human genome . candidate pre-mirna loci that were predicted by both algorithms were pinpointed and evaluated by manual inspection. we adapted another public available tool htseq to quantify the expression values of known mirnas that were present in the mirbase database . the expression level of each mirna was normalized by a rpm   <cit>  value calculated as c/mn ×  <dig>  where c is “read numbers aligned to a given mirna chromosomal region”, m is “multiple mapping numbers across all mirna regions” and n is “total read numbers that map to human genome sequence”.

overexpress mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in zebrafish embryos
sense strand of mir precursors were synthesized in vitro by using pcsdest-derived plasmids as a template. dna was linearized with noti at 37°c for overnight and cleaned up by dna clean/extraction kit . capped mrna was synthesized by mmessage mmachine sp <dig> kit . approximately 3 nl in vitro synthesized rna solution was microinjected into the animal pole of one-cell stage embryos of the tgs <dig> genotype . the blood vessel phenotype of human mir-injected embryos were scored at 2 days-post fertilization. we quantitated the area of intersegmental blood vessels  by choosing the same imaging fields of zebra fish embryos and analyzed the positive pixels of isv by imagej software .

statistical analysis
experiments were repeated for at least  <dig> times and data are presented as means ± the standard deviation. the mann–whitney u test was used to compare two groups with small sample size  unless otherwise indicated. wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted if the samples are paired.

patient information and diagnosis
all patients with coronary artery disease have typical angina and received coronary angiography which showed >50% luminal narrowing in either coronary branches. for the healthy controls, no angina was disclosed and the baseline electrocardiogram did not show myocardial ischemic changes. a summarized table of patient characteristics was listed on additional file 2: table s <dig> 

RESULTS
patterns of known mirnas in different endothelial lineage cells revealed by smrna-seq
early and late epcs were obtained from the cord blood of healthy subjects as described  <cit> , and matured ecs were isolated from the umbilical cord vein of the same donors. blood mononuclear cells were round when initially seeded on the fibronectin-coated wells. after changing the medium on day  <dig>  attached eepcs with an elongated morphology could be observed . late epcs with a cobblestone-like morphology, which is similar to mature ecs, had grown to confluence by day  <dig> to day  <dig> .figure  <dig>

pilot epc and ec characterization was performed by flow cytometry: the stem cell marker cd <dig> is expressed in ~10% of early epcs  <cit> , and precursor marker cd <dig> is more abundant in late epcs . the hematological cell marker cd <dig> was present in early epcs but not late epcs or huvecs . the endothelial marker cd <dig>  is expressed well in early epcs, late epcs, and huvecs . other endothelial markers, including ve-cadherin and kdr/vegfr <dig> could be identified in late epcs and huvecs . of note, vegfr <dig> is more abundant in late epcs .the abundant expression of the precursor marker cd <dig> and the angiogenic receptor vegfr <dig> raised one possibility that late epcs, due to their relatively undifferentiated status, may be and more active than matured ecs. this possibility was examined by comparing the cell migration and microtubule formation abilities between late epcs and huvec. transwell and matrigel tube formation assays showed that these angiogenesis-related activities are livelier in late epcs .

to explore the underlying mechanisms, mirna expression patterns in different epcs and matured huvec were deciphered by smrna-seq. the analysis pipeline used to identify known mirnas, namely those that have been deposited in the mirbase database r <dig>  is shown in figure 1d, and a total of  <dig> mirbase mirnas were expressed in these three endothelial lineage cells . among them,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were enriched or repressed, respectively, in huvec in a monotonic pattern , and  <dig> micrornas were more abundant in late epcs/huvec than in early epcs . rt-qpcr using independent batches of cord blood epcs verified that anti-angiogenic mirnas such as mir-221-3p and mir-222-3p   <cit>  were enriched in matured ecs . mir-181b-5p, which inhibits arsenic-induced endothelial cell migration/tube formation and nf-κb-mediated ec activation and inflammation  <cit> , is also more abundant in huvec .

twenty-four mirnas were specific expressed in huvec,  <dig> in late epcs, and another  <dig> in early epcs . there expression profiles were summarized by heatmaps in figure 2a. rt-qpcr assays again validated the unique expression of mir-146-5p, mir-143-5p and mir-340-5p in early epcs . our sequencing results are reliable since they correlated well with rt-qpcr validation data .figure  <dig>

novel epc and/or ec mirnas identified by smrna-seq
smrna-seq rather than microarrays for mirnome research is that sequencing technology can not only profile known mirna profiles but also help to pinpoint novel and previous unidentified mirnas. sequencing results generated  <dig>  to  <dig>  million high-quality reads that corresponded to  <dig>  to  <dig>  non-redundant small rna sequences . a data analysis pipeline  <cit>  was applied to remove mrna contamination and collect the reads not mapped to any known mirna loci. novel mirnas predicted by both of the two independent bioinformatics algorithms  were recognized as candidate novel mirnas. these data processing steps yielded 14 ~  <dig> unique genomic loci that potentially encoded novel mirnas in either cell type .figure  <dig>

all these putative novel mirnas had the potential to fold into a hairpin secondary structure, which is one of the criteria necessary for mirnas. figure 3b illustrates some examples. among these candidates, eleven novel mirnas were uniquely expressed in early epcs, eight in late epcs, while another nine in matured ecs . additional file 5: table s <dig> and figure 3d illustrates the abundance, sequences and chromosomal coordinates of these novel mirnas , as well as cell type distributions. the existence of four novel mirnas  in epcs and ecs was verified by rt-qpcr .

mir-221/222cluster mirnas contribute to epc motility and blood vessel formation
consistent with the less active nature of huvec , two anti-angiogenic mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were more abundant in matured ecs . it has been reported that levels of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are higher in epcs from patients with coronary artery disease   <cit> , but the anti-angiogenic role of mir-221/ <dig> and the downstream mechanism in late epcs is unclear. we verified that late epcs isolated from the peripheral blood of cad patients expressed more mir-221/ <dig>  especially mir- <dig>  than those from healthy controls . more significantly, levels of circulating mir-221/ <dig> in the plasma of cad patients were also higher than those in healthy controls . we also tested the effect of vegf on the expression of mir-221/ <dig> to examine whether they are downregulated in an angiogenesis-promoting environment. vegf repressed the levels of matured mir- <dig> and pri-mir-221/ <dig> in diseased late epcs . however, mir- <dig> levels were not significantly affected by vegf , indicating a post-transcriptional event may also be involved in the regulation of mir- <dig> levels in cad late epcs.figure  <dig>

overexpressing mir-221/ <dig> reduced the in vitro cellular motility and microvasculature formation ability of late epcs , which partly explained why these  <dig> mirs were more abundant in disease epcs and in mature ecs. since epcs are capable of forming new blood vessels even in the absence of a pre-existing vessel network  <cit>  and knockdown experiments showed that mir- <dig> is required for endothelial tip cell behaviors during vascular development  <cit> , we examined the role of mir-221/ <dig> in the formation of the blood vessels in vivo. over-expression of either mir- <dig> or mir- <dig> in zebrafish embryos resulted in the deregulation of blood vessel pattern during development . mir- <dig>  but not mir- <dig>  led to a significant reduction in blood vessel density in vivo .

mir-221/ <dig> affect genes involved in hypoxia response, cell migration, energy supply and so on
to explore the underlying mechanisms, we aligned genes down-regulated by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  a total of  <dig> genes were commonly repressed by both mirnas . gene ontology analysis showed that genes involved in hypoxia response, cell migration, energy supply from glucose or fatty acids metabolism, and tgf-beta receptor signaling pathway were selectively repressed by both mirs , consistent with the anti-angiogenic role of these two functional-related mirnas. twelve cell migration genes  were reduced in the presence of mir-221/ <dig>  consistent with the reduced cell motility phenotype in figure 4d. repression of cxcr <dig> levels by both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> was confirmed by rt-qpcr .figure  <dig> 
mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> regulate pik3r <dig> and ets <dig>  respectively, in late epcs.  a venn diagram illustrates there were  <dig> probe sets commonly repressed by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> .  a heat map showing the relative expression levels of these genes. significant enriched biological processes among these genes according to the gene ontology database were also indicated.  predicted duplex formed between ets <dig> and mir-222/mir- <dig>   rt-qpcr results show ets <dig>  and ets <dig>  expression levels in late epcs from health controls  and cad patients. **: p <  <dig>  by mann–whitney test.  reporter activity of the ets <dig> on two 3′utr reporter constructs containing the conserved binding site  and poorly conserved binding site  after cotransfection with the mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> or empty vector into 293 t cells .  mir- <dig> targets pik3r <dig> in late epcs. rt-qpcr show the levels of pik3r <dig> in health and cad late epcs , or in late epcs overexpressed with mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  or both  .  a model of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> regulate epc motility and tube formation functions through pik3r <dig> and ets <dig>  respectively.



nevertheless, no mir-221- or mir-222-binding site could be identified on cxcr <dig> mrna , we searched for direct targets for either mirnas. we found ets <dig> is among mir-222-suppressed genes in late epcs and possesses mir-221/- <dig> binding sites on its 3′utr according to the targetscan bioinformatics prediction . since mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are known to target ets <dig> and ets <dig>  respectively, in matured blood vessel endothelial cells  <cit> , we tested whether ets <dig> and ets <dig> levels in late epcs from cad patients. only ets <dig>  but not ets <dig>  were differentially expressed between diseased and healthy late epcs . the direct repression of ets <dig> translation by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> was examined by 3′utr reporter assays. there are two mir-221/ <dig> binding sites on 3′utr of ets <dig>  predicted by targetscanhuman , one is conserved ; another is poorly conserved  only mir- <dig>  but not mir- <dig>  inhibited ets <dig> translation through both putative binding sites . reporter assays on mutated ets <dig> 3′-utr to show that the mir- <dig> binding site is functional have been done  <cit> .

we also searched target for mir- <dig> in cad late epcs. it is known that mir- <dig> promotes tip cell behavior during vascular development through the repression of phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit  <dig>   <cit> . pik3r <dig> levels were reduced in diseased late epcs . when mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were overexpressed in late epcs, only mir- <dig>  but not mir- <dig>  repressed pik3r <dig> .

discussion
circulating mirnas have attracted major interest as biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . besides their cell intrinsic function, recent studies reported that mirnas are released by cells and can be detected in the blood  <cit> . here we identified the mirnome profiles of early epc, late epc and huvec of the same donor. late epc was found to possess the best angiogenic activities and less mir-221/ <dig> expression. furthermore, circulating mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> levels in the plasma of cad patients were found to be higher. accordingly, other epc and ec mirnas revealed in this study may also hold the potential of being new biomarkers in plasma for monitoring cad or cad-like cases among high risk population  .

human epcs research these years is quite active, partly due to the clinical application potentials of these cells. the angiogenic abilities as well as homing of transplanted epcs to injured sites are critical parameters for therapy to be successful. the number of circulating epcs in a patient’s peripheral blood correlates with the prognosis of many diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, stroke, and cvd  <cit> . these cells are also potential sources for cell therapy that aims to enhance the neovascularization of tissue engineered constructs or ischemic tissues  <cit> . many studies evaluated the possibility of transplantation of late epc for improving disease recovery, for example, the long-term stroke outcome in a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion   <cit> . angiogenic activities as well as homing of transplanted epcs to injured sites are therefore critical parameters for therapy to be successful. genomic tools, including transcriptomic and proteomic ones, have been applied to decipher the gene expression profiles of early and late epcs for understanding and manipulating genes in epcs for therapeutic purposes  <cit> . we recently pinpointed novel surface biomarkers and stemness genes in different epcs, as well as between epcs and matured ecs  <cit> . with this information, it is possible to sort epcs from circulation as well as to identify molecular targets crucial for epc functioning during wound healing and tumor angiogenesis. here we further weighted in this field by disclosing mirna profiles in different epcs and mature ecs. more in-depth wetlab work is still necessary to explore genes and mirna responsible for epc or ec activities.

rna-seq, an application of the emerging ultrahigh throughput next generation sequencing  technologies, has become an attractive alternative to microarrays. not only does it allow researchers to identify differentially expressed genes, rna-seq can further identify novel transcripts that have not yet been recorded in any literatures or databases  <cit> . the novelty of this study is also that we pinpointed a significant number of novel mirnas that vary across epcs and ecs . these findings show that the full repertoire of mirnas in endothelial lineage cells is larger and more complicated than previously appreciated. unmasking the various roles of newly identified mirnas in epc/ec activity and endothelial differentiation will provide new insights for regenerative medicine. we envision our report will serve as a resource and road map for future studies that are aimed at improving our understanding of the various regulatory pathways that ultimately modulate epc/ec activities and angiogenesis.

clinical trials using bone marrow-derived cd34+ or cd133+ stem cells have reported only marginal benefits for treating cad patients  <cit> . goretti et al. demonstrated that mir- <dig> family  which overexpressed in early epcs may restrict the vessel repair function of epcs through inhibition of cell cycle progression associated gene ccnd <dig>  ccne <dig> and cdk <dig>  <cit> . compared with their results, which were performed by microarray screening, we also identified similar mirnas up- or down-regulated in early epc  or in late epc . nevertheless, goretti et al. did not include mature ecs in their comparison. here we used  <dig> endothelial lineage cell types so provide another level of information. cell type-specific mirs will be changed accordingly. furthermore, owing to the advanced smrna-seq technique, we identified more mirnas than the traditional microarray strategy did.

mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are two highly homologous mirnas encoded in tandem from human chromosome xp <dig>  and are highly conserved in vertebrates. we observed defective vascular growth when mir- <dig> or mir- <dig>  especially mir- <dig>  was overexpressed in zebrafish. overexpressing mir- <dig> in zebrafish caused deregulated blood vessel pattern but not the reduction of vessel density, which may partly due to the fact that mir- <dig> is required for vascular development by promoting tip cell migration and proliferation in zebrafish during vascular development  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> also inhibit erythropoiesis and erythroleukemic cell growth via down-modulating ckit  <cit> . mir-221/ <dig> inhibit ec  <cit>  and epc motility and microtubule formation. consistent with these observations, in late epcs from cad patients the expression levels of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are increased   <cit> . reduced levels of circulating epcs independently predict atherosclerotic disease progression and development of cardiovascular events  <cit> . clinical studies demonstrated that levels of circulating epcs are associated with vascular endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors, and help to identify patients at increased cardiovascular risk  <cit> . circulating epcs in peripheral blood are mobilized from bone marrow by chemokine stimulation such as chemokine  ligand  <dig>   <cit> . we found both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> repressed in late epcs the levels of chemokine  receptor  <dig> , the receptor for cxcl <dig> , partly explains why mir-221/ <dig> inhibit late epc motility , and epc levels were reduced in the peripheral blood of cad patients. since neither mir- <dig> nor mir- <dig> targets cxcr <dig> directly according to bioinformatics prediction, how cxcr <dig> levels are regulated is still an open question. we demonstrated another candidate mir- <dig> target gene – pik3r <dig>  which is also important in regulating endothelial tip cell migration and proliferation in epc  <cit> . pik3r <dig> is the p85α regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide-3-kinase . previous study indicated mir- <dig> may regulate the delicate stoichiometry of pik3r <dig> subunit to maintain the correct subcellular localization and regulate downstream flt <dig> expression  <cit> . ets <dig> is a known target of mir- <dig> in mature endothelial cells  <cit>  and contributes to embryonic angiogenesis regulation and may play a role in the modulation and maturation of epc. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> each has unique targets and different mechanisms to repress the activities of diseased late epcs . other biomarker candidates among our mined mirnas with supporting references are indicated in additional file 3: tables s <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results demonstrate mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> repress the levels of pik3r <dig> and ets <dig>  respectively to regulate angiogenic features in epcs and ecs  and suggest mechanisms of why late epc levels and activities are reduced in cad patients. overall, our data provide evidences that mirna research will not only help us to understand more about epc biology, but will also lead to the development of novel biomarkers and therapeutic modalities for the prevention and treatment of cad and other ischemia-related diseases such as stroke and diabetes.
