BACKGROUND
endogenous retroviruses  are found in the genome of all vertebrates. they are derived from retroviral infections of germ-line cells followed by permanent incorporation, called colonization, into the host's genome. ervs are transmitted vertically to the offspring as part of the parental genome by mendelian order  <cit> . it is estimated that human ervs  and murine ervs  constitute approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> % of their genomes, respectively  <cit> . the majority of ervs have defective genomes as a result of the accumulation of deletional or insertional mutations as well as recombinations since their initial colonization. however, certain ervs retain the full coding potentials for all or individual retroviral polypeptides  <cit> . it has also been well-documented that retroviral long terminal repeats , which harbor unique u <dig> promoter and enhancer sequences, are capable of directly regulating the transcriptional activities  of neighboring host genes  <cit> . therefore, in conjunction with the diversity of the erv u <dig> promoter sequences, these findings infer active participation of ervs in a range of normal physiologic as well as pathologic events of the host  <cit> .

the association between ervs and pathologic events underlying tumorigenesis and autoimmune diseases has been described in a number of reports  <cit> . for instance, expression of retroviral proteins from the human teratocarcinoma-derived virus , a member of the herv-k family, has been detected in tetratocarcinoma cell lines, breast cancer, and testicular tumors  <cit> . further support for the ervs' roles in various disease processes comes from studies that show some hervs  contain the intact envelope  gene capable of coding an env glycoprotein called syncytin  <cit> . syncytin was originally identified as a fusogenic glycoprotein, which plays a crucial role in syncytiotrophoplast formation and placenta morphogenesis during periimplantation of embryos  <cit> . in recent studies, the proinflammatory properties of syncytin have been attributed to axonal demyelination, at least in part, during the development of autoimmune multiple sclerosis in humans  <cit> . in addition, hervs are implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of other autoimmune diseases, such as schizophrenia, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and systemic lupus erythematosus  <cit> . however, further investigations are needed to fully understand the roles of ervs in these and other disease processes in humans and animals.

in our previous studies, we demonstrated that burn-elicited stress signals altered the expression of muervs in distant organs of mice in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> . these muervs had unique u <dig> promoter sequences suggesting different profiles of transcription regulatory elements in each of these sequences. interestingly, some of these muervs are very similar in viral genome structure to the murine acquired immune deficiency syndrome  virus, which is known to cause immune disorders in infected mice  <cit> . these findings led to the hypothesis that burn-elicited stress signals are responsible, at least in part, for the genome-wide response of specific muervs. in addition, they may play causative roles in post-burn pathogenesis as well as in other stress-related disease processes. in this study, we identified putative muervs whose expression was altered in response to burn-elicited stress signals. subsequently, the biological properties , viral tropism, branching ages, recombination events, and neighboring host genes) of these muervs were analyzed, and their roles in post-burn pathogenesis are discussed.

RESULTS
differential alterations in muerv expression profiles in distant organs of mice after burn
to investigate the changes in genome-wide muerv expression after burn, we examined the transcription profiles of non-ecotropic muerv u <dig> regions in the liver, lungs, and kidney from both burn and no burn mice  by rt-pcr . it needs to be noted that the no burn groups were subjected to anesthesia and fluid resuscitation. the u <dig> regions were selected for expression analysis because of their highly polymorphic sequences among the muerv population compared to the rest of the viral genome. the u <dig> expression profiles of these individual tissues were compared to the genomic  profile as well as the expression profiles of corresponding tissues harvested without any treatment, such as anesthesia and resuscitation . changes in the u <dig> expression profiles in all three tissues were evident at  <dig> hours after burn and these changes were tissue-specific. in addition, substantial differences in u <dig> expression profiles were observed in lung samples at  <dig> hours after burn . these changes were manifested by either an increase or decrease in the expression of specific u <dig> regions after burn. the u <dig> regions amplified in this experiment, which include an approximately  <dig> bp of additional sequence upstream and downstream of the u <dig>  were represented by seven major groups ranging in size from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. interestingly, the u <dig> expression profiles of no burn controls  of all three tissues at  <dig> hours were different at  <dig> hours. in addition, the u <dig> expression profiles of tissues without any treatment were substantially different from no burn controls at both time points. the difference in the u <dig> expression profiles among no burn controls at two different time points and no treatment controls suggests that anesthesia and resuscitation transiently affected the expression of muervs.

to investigate whether there are post-burn changes in the expression of muerv envelope protein, western blot analyses were performed . in the liver, there was significantly increased reactivity in a band slightly smaller than  <dig> kd  at day  <dig> after burn. similarly, induction of a reactive protein smaller than  <dig> kd was observed in the kidney at day  <dig>  however, there were no significant changes in the lung. it is likely that the cleavage and/or truncation of the intact envelope protein products due to mutation may account for the presence of the apparently smaller than the expected size .

identification and characterization of differentially regulated muerv u <dig> sequences after burn
to determine genetic variations among differentially expressed muerv u <dig> sequences in distant organs after a burn, the u <dig> sequences isolated from the rt-pcr products were subjected to multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses. amplified muerv u <dig> sequences from each experimental group were subjected to cloning after purification of the pcr reactions. clones from each group were picked for sequencing analysis primarily based on the differences in size. a total of  <dig> muerv u <dig> sequences were initially cloned from all three tissues of both burn and no burn mice, and subsequent multiple alignment analyses identified  <dig> unique u <dig> sequences with nine different sizes  . of the  <dig> u <dig> sequences,  <dig> were isolated from tissues of burn mice,  <dig> were isolated from no burn mice, and three were from both burn and no burn mice. both the 5'-end and 3'-end regions of the u <dig> sequences analyzed in this experiment were conserved, however, the sequences spanning the middle region were highly variable . the variations in this middle region included the presence and/or absence of several direct repeats and a  <dig> bp insertion. these variations may be directly associated with the different transcription potentials of each u <dig> promoter. it has been documented that muerv tropism is closely linked to their u <dig> sequences. the tropism characteristics of each u <dig> sequence was determined by comparison analysis using the reference sequences  first reported by tomonaga et al.  <cit> . a total of three intact direct repeats , one  <dig> bp insertion, and one unique sequence  were identified among the u <dig> sequences examined . in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  two other direct repeats , which were not identified or were partially identified in this experiment, were marked as a reference. primarily, four direct repeats , one unique region , and one  <dig> bp insertion were used for the tropism analysis. no obvious difference was noted between groups of burn and no burn in regard to tropism. table  <dig> summarizes the tropism analysis of all  <dig> u <dig> sequences,  <dig> polytropic and  <dig> xenotropic. the phylogenetic analysis of the u <dig> sequences yielded a significant branching pattern with bootstrap values of greater than  <dig>  it revealed six major u <dig> groups, which paralleled the size of the u <dig> sequences  . it was of interest to note that the  <dig> bp group  consists of predominantly u <dig> sequences isolated from no burn mice, in contrast to the  <dig> bp group , which mostly were derived from burn mice. comparison analysis of the sizes of differentially expressed u <dig> fragments  and u <dig> clones provided information regarding the origins of these u <dig> clones. based on these comparison data, four u <dig> sequences isolated from burn mice  were likely derived from the ~ <dig> bp fragment , which was induced  <dig> hours after burn . in addition, five u <dig> sequences in group i  were presumed to originate from the ~ <dig> bp fragments  whose expression was evident in no burn control mice compared to burn mice . the l-1- <dig> u <dig> and u-1- <dig> u <dig> in the group ii were likely to be derived from the baseline expression of the ~ <dig> bp fragment expressed in no burn mice . it is also possible that these u <dig> sequences could be associated with stress signals from anesthesia and resuscitation. further comparison analysis of the rt-pcr data and u <dig> clones will elucidate the relations between each differentially expressed u <dig> fragment and u <dig> clones of different sizes examined in this study.

comparative analysis of transcriptional potentials of  <dig> unique u <dig> promoter sequences
to gain insights into the transcription potential, the profile of putative transcription regulatory elements within each u <dig> promoter sequence was determined. a total of  <dig> putative transcription regulatory elements were identified within all  <dig> u <dig> promoter sequences using the database from genomatix  . among these transcription regulatory elements, five   were present predominantly in the u <dig> sequences isolated from burn mice. on the other hand,  <dig> elements , such as nf-κb, c-myb, gut-enriched krueppel-like factor, and ppar/rxr heterodimer, were mostly mapped to the u <dig> sequences originating from no burn mice. further characterization of the specific roles of the transcription regulatory elements predominantly present in the u <dig> sequences from either burn or no burn mice in burn-elicited systemic pathogenesis is warranted.

genomic mapping and characterization of putative muervs harboring individual u <dig> sequences
in this experiment, the putative muervs harboring the individual u <dig> sequences within their ltrs were identified and mapped by a systemic search of the mouse genome database  using each u <dig> sequence as a probe. when the search homology was limited to ≥ 98%, different u <dig> probes often resulted in an overlapping set of putative muervs. a total of  <dig> unique putative muervs were identified and their genomic map was established . the size  of these muervs ranged between  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp. among them, the u <dig> sequences of six putative muervs   had  <dig> % homology with the respective u <dig> sequences isolated from burn mice. in addition,  <dig> putative muervs  harbored u <dig> sequences matching  <dig> % to their respective u <dig> sequences isolated from no burn mice. the precise location and orientation on the genome, proviral genome size, pbs, and coding potential for the three major retroviral polypeptides of each putative muerv were also characterized. in regard to pbs, the  <dig> bp sequences located immediately downstream of 5' ltr were surveyed to determine the pbs of each putative muerv. the trnagln  primer is known to be used by the reverse transcriptase of polytropic as well as modified polytropic muervs during replication. in contrast, the trnapro  primer is predominantly used by ecotropic and xenotropic muervs. except for the two putative muervs  harboring a trnapro pbs, the rest  had a trnagln pbs. the results from the analyses of coding potentials revealed that the majority of putative muervs had a defective genome leading to a missing start codon and/or introduction of a premature stop codon. however,  <dig> of them retained intact open reading frames  for all three retroviral polypeptides , therefore, they were presumed to be full-length ervs. some of those defective muervs had intact orfs for gag, pol, and/or env polypeptides. the putative muervs cloned by u <dig> probes, which were presumed to originate from the burn-induced u <dig> fragments, will be the primary focus for future studies.

examination of evolutionary relationship among putative muervs by phylogenetic analysis of their reverse transcriptases
due to the highly conserved nature of the reverse transcriptase  among different retroviruses compared to the rest of viral proteins, the rt sequence has been used to determine phylogenetic relationships among retroviruses as well as other retroelements  <cit> . to examine the evolutionary relationship of the putative muervs identified in this study, a phylogenetic tree of rt sequences was constructed following a multiple alignment analysis . this phylogenetic analysis was based on the seven conserved domains of the rt, a total of  <dig> amino acids, which served as a reference for a number of evolutionary studies  <cit> . among the  <dig> putative muervs, only  <dig> of them were subjected to the analysis because the other  <dig> muervs had an incomplete rt due to a deletion and/or premature stop. it appeared that they were subgrouped into four main branches . the putative muervs derived from the same u <dig> probes tended to cluster into the same branches. interestingly, four out of the five putative muervs  identified using the u <dig> probes from burn mice  clustered into a unique branch , implicating a close evolutionary relationship. it needs to be noted that these muervs had  <dig> % sequence homology with the respective u <dig> probes used for mapping.

examination of tropism of  <dig> putative full-length muervs by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis
the muerv coding sequences are relatively conserved except for the env sequences. for instance, the env amino acid sequences of ecotropic muervs are substantially divergent from the other classes   <cit> . muervs can be grouped into four different classes  based on restriction fragment length polymorphism  following digestion with three enzymes   <cit> . in this experiment,  <dig> putative full-length muervs with intact coding potentials for all three polypeptides were subjected to an in silico rflp analysis to determine their tropism . six  of them were polytropic and another six  were modified polytropic. the rflp tropism data  was consistent with the results regarding the tropism of the corresponding u <dig> probes/sequences . in addition, four putative muervs  had unique rflp profiles, which did not match with the reference, suggesting "xenotropic-like" tropism  <cit> . further investigation is necessary to confirm the tropism of these four "xenotropic-like" putative muervs.

genetic evidence of recombination events in certain putative muervs
there are two unique features of muervs: two identical  copies of flanking ltrs and a short direct repeat created at the genomic target during integration. they serve as indicators of integration ages as well as genomic recombination events that occurred in the host after the initial integration. the integration age of muervs can be estimated based on the degree of accumulated mutations within the presumed to be identical flanking ltrs of each muerv. among the  <dig> putative muervs examined, only  <dig> of them had mutations within each pair of ltrs ranging from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % . the integration ages of these muervs were calculated based on a formula of " <dig>  % mutation rate between two flanking ltrs/one million years "  <cit> . the integration ages of the putative muervs analyzed in this study ranged from  <dig>  myr to  <dig>  myr. in addition, as an indicator of genomic rearrangements between muervs as well as in other parts of the genome, we examined a short stretch of sequences  flanking each muerv for a direct repeat. it turned out that  <dig> out of  <dig> muervs were not flanked by a direct repeat, indicating that they were formed via recombination between two different muervs . the rest had direct repeats of  <dig> bp except for the u-1- <dig>  muerv, which had direct repeats of  <dig> bp.

host genes near the integration sites of putative muervs
the u <dig> promoter and enhancer sequences residing in the muerv ltrs often regulate the transcriptional activities of neighboring host genes at different levels   <cit> . to gain insights regarding potential roles of the putative muervs identified in this study, host genes within  <dig> kb upstream and downstream from the integration sites of each putative muervs were identified . nine putative muervs were integrated within the introns of various types of host genes, either in the same or opposite orientation. this suggests that expression of these host genes might be controlled by the u <dig> promoter and enhancer sequences of the respective putative muervs. in addition, at least one known host gene was identified from the  <dig> putative muervs  within the search range . for instance, the k-3- <dig>  putative muerv was integrated near a cluster of various isotypes of histone genes on chromosome  <dig>  other host genes found near the integration sites of selective putative muervs include selp, f <dig>  fcgr3a, and scpep <dig>  which are known to participate in various physiologic processes, such as inflammation and vascular wall homeostasis  <cit> . although these putative muervs are not located within the host genes, their ltrs are still capable of controlling the transcriptional activities of nearby host genes. no known host genes were mapped near the integration sites of the last eight putative muervs within the search range.

discussion
burn-elicited stress signals are directly linked to pathologic changes in distant organs contributing to systemic inflammatory responses syndrome and often multiple organ failure  <cit> . the results from our previous studies demonstrated that the expression of certain muervs was differentially altered in various tissues of mice after burn, suggesting that muervs may play a role in post-burn pathologic changes. involvement of ervs in inflammatory disease processes was exemplified by the direct role of syncytin, an envelope protein of herv-w, in the development of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease  <cit> . in addition, ervs are implicated in an array of other diseases such as breast cancer, schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, iddm, myeloid leukemia, and t cell lymphoma  <cit> . however, a substantial amount of further studies are essential to gain clear insights into the ervs' role in a number of disease processes, including systemic response after burn injury.

in this study, we confirmed that burn-elicited stress signals alter the expression of certain muervs in a u <dig> promoter- and tissue- specific manner. during the course of this study,  <dig> unique muerv u <dig> sequences were identified from distant organs  of burn and no burn mice. size-based comparison analysis of the differentially expressed u <dig> fragments  and  <dig> u <dig> clones allowed us to determine whether the u <dig> clones are derived from the burn-induced u <dig> fragments. each u <dig> promoter sequence had a unique transcription potential. it is likely that burn-elicited stress signals alter the intracellular transcription environment by activation or inactivation of certain transcription factors in a cell type- and tissue-specific manner, thereby, leading to differential genome-wide regulation of specific muervs. the muervs that were induced after a burn may have a pathophysiologic role in the systemic response different from repressed muervs. it was of interest to note that the u <dig> expression profiles in all three tissues of no burn mice  at  <dig> hours were significantly different from the profiles at  <dig> hours. in addition, the u <dig> profiles of no burn mice at both time points did not match corresponding control tissues harvested without any treatment. these findings suggest that the initial treatments  during the burn procedure contributed to changes in the u <dig> expression profiles in a tissue-specific manner. furthermore, the genomic u <dig> profile was distantly related to the u <dig> expression profiles from both burn and no burn mice, including mice without any treatment. it suggests that not all muervs on the mouse genome were actively transcribed and/or responded to stress signals in the tissues examined in this study. it will be worthwhile to perform a comprehensive examination of the muerv expression profile in various cell types as well as tissue types.

several transcription regulatory elements were identified more frequently in u <dig> sequences isolated from burn mice. these include binding sites for hmga1/ <dig>  c/ebpβ, pax <dig>  szf <dig>  and thing1/e <dig> heterodimer. these genes are known to participate in various normal as well as pathologic processes, such as szf1's role in hematopoiesis and the involvement of c/ebpβ in the regulation of proinflammatory genes  <cit> . in addition, recent reports demonstrated that hmga <dig> functions as a mediator of the development of sepsis, as evidenced by its increased serum levels in patients with septic shock  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis revealed that four of the u <dig> sequences  whose transcriptional activities are presumed to be induced in burn mice were clustered into a unique branch  and all have the hmga1/ <dig> binding element. we can speculate that the elevated systemic levels of hmga <dig> protein during burn-elicited septic development may enhance transcriptional activities of certain muerv u <dig> promoters, such as k-4- <dig> u <dig>  k-4- <dig> u <dig>  l-4- <dig> u <dig>  and u-4- <dig> u <dig>  through the hmga1/ <dig> binding element. it will be necessary to determine whether the transcription regulatory elements, predominantly present on the u <dig> promoters from burn mice, interact with corresponding proteins which in turn result in altered transcriptional activities. in addition, two hormone-related binding elements for steroidogenic factor  <dig> and estrogen-related receptor  <dig>  were identified in both burn and no burn groups. it is possible that these elements may play a role in muerv responses to changes in hormone levels due to various types of stress signals  <cit> . since there is an increase in systemic glucocorticoid levels after burn, we tried to find a glucocorticoid response element on the u <dig> promoters isolated from burn mice, but we were not able to.

almost all ervs are considered to be defective in their genomic organization, and as a result, they are not capable of encoding intact retroviral polypeptides and are replication-incompetent. in this study, in silico mapping/cloning experiments using the  <dig> u <dig> sequences as a probe revealed  <dig> putative muervs. among them,  <dig> putative muervs retained coding potentials for all three retroviral polypeptides and at least  <dig> of them were classified as polytropic or modified polytropic in regard to their tropism. these findings indicate that a substantial fraction of the muerv population on the mouse genome is capable of encoding functional proteins and can infect host cells when they are activated for replication. another group of putative muervs, defective in their genome structures, had intact coding potentials for gag, pol, and/or env polypeptides and it is likely that changes in the expression of these individual proteins affect the host cells' normal physiology, such as overexpression of syncytin in the brain of multiple sclerosis patients. it might be necessary to further characterize the biological roles of muervs presumed to be derived from u <dig> probes induced after burn.

one of the key findings from this study was that the majority of putative muervs are integrated into introns or near the host genes, suggesting that burn-mediated regulation of some of these muervs may be linked to the expression of neighboring host genes. the u-1- <dig>  putative muerv was integrated between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> of the cathepsin e gene, which is essential for immune defense against microbial pathogens via its protease activity  <cit> . interestingly, the u-1- <dig> u <dig> probe was derived from the lung and cathepsin e was differentially expressed in the lung compared to other tissues, such as kidney  <cit> . in addition, the l-1- <dig>  putative muerv derived from the l-1- <dig> u <dig> probe  was integrated between exon  <dig> and  <dig> of chromosome domain-helicase-dna-binding protein  <dig> , a chromosome remodelling factor  <cit> . our recent study provided evidence suggesting a potential chromosomal remodelling in the liver after burn  <cit> . it will be of interest to investigate whether the u <dig> promoter and enhancer sequences of the l-1- <dig>  putative muerv affect the expression of chd <dig> in the liver after burn. furthermore, the u-4- <dig>  putative muerv, which was derived from the u-4- <dig> u <dig> probe , was integrated near a cluster of immunoglobulin gamma  fc receptor genes. among these igg fc receptors, fcgr3a has been described as a susceptibility factor for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . an investigation into the role of the u-4- <dig>  putative muerv in the transcriptional control of igg fc receptor genes after burn, especially the fcgr3a gene, will allow us to better understand interactions between this muerv locus and nearby igg fc receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrated that burn-elicited stress signals were responsible for a differential genome-wide alteration in muerv expression in a tissue- and u <dig> promoter-specific manner. biological properties of the  <dig> putative muervs, which were isolated using the u <dig> sequences as a probe, were examined in silico and their potential roles in post-burn pathologic changes were discussed. further characterization of the full-length as well as defective muervs identified in this study is warranted to gain insights into their biological roles, including their interaction/relationship with neighboring genes, in both normal physiology and disease states of the host.
