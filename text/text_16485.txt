BACKGROUND
triplex-forming oligonucleotides  have attracted considerable interest due to their potential as therapeutics for gene targeting, which allows transcriptional control, gene knock-out and sequence-selective treatment  <cit> . furthermore, tfo can be used for recognition and purification of dna  <cit> . tfo bind in the major groove on homopurine sequences of watson-crick-based antiparallel duplex dna and are divided into hoogsteen and reverse hoogsteen formations by orientation of the third strand  <cit> . hoogsteen formation is based upon the parallel binding of a tfo consisting of ct or gt sequences to the homopurine sequence of the antiparallel duplex dna  <cit> , whereas reverse hoogsteen is formed by a tfo consisting of gt or ga sequences in antiparallel binding with the homopurine sequence of the antiparallel duplex dna   <cit> . antiparallel duplex -, reverse hoogsteen- and gt hoogsteen-formations are ph independent, whereas the formation of hoogsteen ct parallel triplexes are ph dependent due to the need for protonated cytosine in the tfo  <cit> .

melting points  for dna duplex and triplex are often investigated by uv absorbance based on melting curve analysis, and this method is widely used for evaluation of novel artificial nucleic acid analogs  <cit> . although uv absorbance is a commonly used method and considered as the golden standard, it is limited by: 1) a relatively low sample throughput; 2) the need for relatively large amounts of oligonucleotides; 3) a relatively low switch in absorbance level upon melting; and 4) the possibility for overlapping peaks for each strand composition in the melting profile  <cit> . as an alternative to uv absorbance, melting curve analysis can be performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction  platforms e.g. the lightcycler  <cit> . real-time pcr platforms are available in many laboratories and melting curves are already used routinely for evaluation of pcr products and even as a tool for genotyping  <cit> .

in  <dig> a lightcycler based method for melting point determination of duplex, triplex and quadruplex formation using oligonucleotides labelled with fluorescein  and a quencher  was published  <cit> . the fluorescence intensity of fam is well known to be highly ph dependent and to decrease towards acidic ph. as a consequence, the melting curve is very flat and the change in fluorescence is only 1- <dig> lightcycler units on a  <dig> units scale at acidic ph  <cit> . such small changes in fluorescence are likely to influence the accuracy of tm and Δtm and a new ph stable fluorophore pair is needed for detection of ph-dependent parallel triplexes. atto fluorophores could be used as such a fluorophore pair and has previously been applied to melting point determinations of antiparallel duplexes at neutral ph  <cit> . we describe a novel ph-independent fluorescence resonance energy transfer -based atto fluorophore pair using non-linked oligonucleotides to study the thermal stability of watson-crick-based dna antiparallel duplex and hoogsteen-based dna parallel triplex. furthermore, we have thoroughly validated our method and compared it to uv absorbance measurements.

RESULTS
evaluation of fret pairs
to develop a ph independent fret system, two comparable fret-pairs consisting of atto495-atto647n and fam-cy <dig> were constructed . each fluorophore was evaluated independently for temperature and ph dependence in sodium cacodylate buffers . for atto <dig>  the fluorescence was independent of ph, but decreased with increasing temperature . when the temperature was between 50°c and 70°c minor variations in fluorescence were observed at acidic ph; such variations were eliminated when magnesium chloride was excluded from the buffer . the background fluorescence of fam changed significantly with both ph and temperature . when ph increased, the fluorescence intensity of fam increased. at acidic ph, an increase in fluorescence with increasing temperature was observed, whereas the opposite was observed at neutral ph. only minor changes in fluorescence of fam with temperature were found in buffers without magnesium chloride . atto647n and cy <dig> were only slightly excitated by the laser resulting in low background fluorescence. for atto647n and cy <dig> no ph dependence was observed .

antiparallel duplex
the atto495-atto647n fret pair designed for tm determinations of antiparallel duplex formation was ph independent from ph  <dig>  to  <dig>  , whereas the fluorescence level of the fam-cy <dig> fret pair changed greatly with ph . at ph below  <dig> , no fam-cy <dig> melting curves could be defined. moreover, the decrease in the fret-based fluorescence was larger in the atto495-atto647n system  compared to the fam-cy <dig> system , indicating a more accurate tm determination in the atto system .

parallel triplex
as seen in figure 3c and 3d, tm for parallel triplex changed  with ph for both fret pairs. the fluorescence of atto495-atto647n triplex formation decreased at increasing ph values, clearly depicting the decreased stability of triplex formation from ph  <dig>  to  <dig> , but even at ph  <dig>  a well-defined melting peak was observed - in contrast to the fam-cy <dig> triplex formation, where no melting peak could be determined at ph  <dig> . for atto495-atto647n, a large decrease in the level of fluorescence  was observed upon melting throughout the acidic ph-range . the melting curves for fam-cy <dig> were difficult to interpret, even in the optimal 'triplex forming' ph range . this is due to the low fluorescence level and small decrease  upon melting. similar results were obtained for fam-black hole quencher  <dig> . in this system only a modest increase in fluorescence  was observed upon melting .

buffer types and probe concentrations
the tm of atto495-647n antiparallel duplex formation was lower in sodium phosphate buffer compared with sodium cacodylate buffer, whereas the opposite was the case for parallel triplex formation in sodium acetate buffer compared with sodium cacodylate buffer .

different concentrations of atto495-647n probes from  <dig>  μm to  <dig>  μm were found to change the level of fluorescence, but not the tm determination for antiparallel duplex and parallel triplex formation .

lightcycler program validation
to ensure the robustness of the melting curve determination on the lightcycler platform when using the atto495-atto647n fret pair, different variations of the lightcycler program were performed . changes in all program steps except the final dissociation step  had minor influence on tm. with increasing melting curve dissociation speed, tm for parallel triplex increased, whereas dissociation time had no effect on tm of antiparallel duplex .

validation of the lightcycler system
when antiparallel duplex tm determinations were run on one lightcycler, the intra-assay coefficient of variation was  <dig> %, whereas the inter-assay coefficient of variation was  <dig> % . when running the assay simultaneously on two lightcyclers, the inter-machine variation for antiparallel duplex formation tm determination was  <dig> °c . this was due to a parallel shift in tm and not to random variation. probes and buffer could be mixed and kept at 4°c before the lightcycler run for two days without any significant changes in tm. the atto fluorophores were very stable and the mean fluorescence level did not change for capillaries left at 4°c or room temperature for  <dig> days .

intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation for antiparallel duplex formation in sodium phosphate buffer ph  <dig>  with  <dig>  μm of each probe and parallel triplex formation in sodium acetate buffer ph  <dig>  with  <dig>  μm of each probe.

for parallel triplex formation the intra-assay coefficient of variation on tm determination was  <dig> %, and the inter-assay coefficient of variation on this lightcycler was  <dig> % . when using two lightcyclers a parallel shift in tm of  <dig> °c  was found. mixed probes and buffer could be kept at 4°c for eight days before the lightcycler run without any significant changes in tm. the mean fluorescence level of the atto fluorophores for parallel triplex formation  was found to decrease for capillaries left at 4°c or room temperature. after  <dig> days, a mean fluorescence level of  <dig>  for capillaries left at 4°c and  <dig>  for capillaries left at room temperature compared to initially  <dig> / <dig>  was found .

comparison of uv-absorbance and lightcycler tm determination
for antiparallel duplex formation, the mean tm of quadruplicate measurements by uv-absorbance was  <dig> °c with a standard deviation  of  <dig> °c and a range from  <dig>  to  <dig> °c, whereas the mean tm determined by lightcycler was  <dig> °c with a std dev of  <dig> °c and a range from  <dig>  to  <dig> °c . uv absorbance measurements of probe mixtures without atto fluorophores showed a mean tm of  <dig> °c with a std dev of  <dig> °c and range from  <dig>  to  <dig> °c. the variance of tm by uv absorbance was  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  on the lightcycler .

for parallel triplex formation uv-absorbance measurements of tm was  <dig> °c with a std dev of  <dig> °c and a range from  <dig>  to  <dig> °c, compared to a tm of  <dig> °c with a std dev of  <dig> °c and a range from  <dig>  to  <dig> °c by lightcycler determination . parallel triplex measurements without atto fluorophores by uv absorbance had a mean tm of  <dig> °c with a std dev of  <dig> °c and a range from  <dig>  to  <dig> °c. the variance of tm was  <dig>  by uv absorbance compared with  <dig>  on the lightcycler .

discussion
fluorescein is unionised at acidic ph and the fluorescence intensity changes with ph  <cit> . as expected, our results clearly demonstrate this effect on fluorescence levels using a fret pair and a quencher pair with fam. by use of the atto495-atto647n fret pair for hoogsteen-based parallel triplex formation, a robust and reliably lightcycler method was established. this novel fret pair is well-suited for tm and Δtm determinations over a broad ph range of parallel triplex formations.

furthermore, this fret pair clearly demonstrates the ph independence from ph  <dig>  to  <dig>  of antiparallel duplex tm determinations in contrast to the ph dependent tm determination of parallel triplex formation from ph  <dig>  to  <dig> . an interesting feature of this is the negative correlation between ph and fluorescence intensity as ph increases from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for parallel triplex formation . this is in concordance with the expected lower efficacy of parallel triplex formation due to the lack of protonated cytosine at less acidic ph  <cit> . this effect could not be demonstrated with fam-based fret, because the intensity of the fam fluorescence increases with ph.

changing the buffer system lead to alterations in tm determination, especially for parallel triplex formation in sodium acetate compared with sodium cacodylate buffers. the melting point changes might be explained by different stability of parallel triplex formation in different buffers and different monovalent cation concentrations  <cit> .

overall, ph, buffer and lightcycler program were found to influence the melting point determination for parallel triplex formation. the reasons, why we validated our method to a dissociation ramp rate of 3°c/min instead of 1°c/min, as generally used for tm determinations by uv absorbance, were: 1) that changes in the lightcycler program led to uniform parallel shifts of tm independent of ph; 2) an extremely low inter-assay variation despite the faster dissociation rate; 3) the lightcycler program was shortened with almost one hour. as long as the lightcycler program is described and it is not changed within a study, we recommend the faster dissociation rate.

in the current study melting temperatures determined by lightcycler were consistently higher than those obtained by uv-absorbance and reflect the higher dissociation ramp rate chosen for lightcycler tm determinations. the variance of individual melting point measurements by lightcycler was significantly reduced compared to uv absorbance measurements. the high reproducibility of lightcycler determinations is especially important when small melting point differences are to be determined.

the presence of atto fluorophores increased tm of antiparallel duplex formation measured by uv absorbance. this was surprising, but modifications such as quenchers have previously been reported to alter tm up to 4°c  <cit> . the presence or absence of atto fluorophores did not alter tm of parallel triplex formation determined by uv absorbance, which suggest a steric proximity of the atto fluorophores in antiparallel duplex formation compared with parallel triplex formation.

CONCLUSIONS
based upon a novel pair of ph stable atto fluorophores, a ph stable fret system was established on the lightcycler platform. this system is highly suitable for melting point determination of watson-crick duplex formation and ph dependent hoogsteen-based parallel triplex formation. the method has been thoroughly validated and we have shown that the variance on melting point determinations is significantly smaller when measured by the lightcycler compared to measurements by uv absorbance. this high throughput and low cost method can be used to measure and distinguish even very small differences in tm and Δtm in a variety of applications within molecular biology.
